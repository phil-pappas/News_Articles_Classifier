There are a LOT of places to stay, but the cheapest I could find was Hotel KK (almost directly opposite the railway entrance) where the no frills single rooms cost Rs 250 with some of the cleanest common bathrooms I had seen in months. I didn't understand how the ILP system worked and wasted some time trying to figure it out. If you are short on time and heavy on cash, your best bet is to head to the Nepali Mandir in Guwahati (5 mins walk from the Railway station entrance on the Paltan Bazaar side...just ask anybody for directions) and enter the tall building nearby where the AP Tourism Office exists. For Rs 420 per approved tourist circuit (Total 11 circuits, http://www.arunachaltourism.com/destination.php ), they will take your photo and give you a nice looking permit card valid for 30 days. They are quite friendly, but they cannot help provide information about AP since most of them are from Assam and have never been to AP. If you are like me and find that option too expensive, the other option is to take a bus towards Rukminigaon (Rs 10 from the railway station on paltan bazaar side) and then ask anyone for directions to Manasa Mandir. The Deputy office is directly opposite. For Rs 5 you can pick up an application form and can submit along with a Rs 25 fee and 2 passport photos. If you are lucky and the guy behind the counter happens to be in a good mood (unlikely), you can expect to collect it the next day like most people did (especially businessmen) or else collect the day after. The folks here weren't friendly and I didn't enjoy dealing with them at all, but it was cheaper than the alternative.[/COLOR] I received my ILP for Bomdila and Tawang at 4PM and my options were to either head to Tezpur and halt the night there and get a sumo to Bomdila in the morning, or stay in Guwahati and take the 5AM bus that goes all the way to Bomdila arriving in the evening. I wanted to save some time and spend at least half a day exploring Bomdila so decided to head to Tezpur immediately. The winger service to Tezpur is opposite the ASTC bus station in Paltan Bazaar and the last one leaves at about 5:30 PM at a cost of Rs 180. This will drop you off around 10PM or so depending on traffic. If you can avoid ending up here at night it may be better since maps are poor and it is hard to get your bearings at night. The hotels definitely know they got you and will charge extra. I ended up paying Rs 250 at Hotel Zeerane for a really small and crappy room, but it was just for the night and it didn't bother me enough to go looking for another. Bomdila - Tawang: Bomdila: From the Tezpur sumo stand I caught the early morning sumo towards Bomdila for Rs 350. I didn’t need a sign to tell me I was in Arunachal and just had to watch the plains and good roads disappear giving way to a wall of mountains and bad roads. After letting the guards glance at our documents at the checkpost, our sumo continued on making good time. It was a very pleasant ride expect for the stop at the market in Bhalukpong where the driver made us wait while the locals butchered up the biggest pig I had ever seen and loaded up some of its meat in leaky plastic bags next to the passenger bags. Arrived at the Bomdila sumo stand around 10:30 and the weather was a bit chilly, but not too bad. I immediately got my ticket to Tawang for the next day and made my way down to the Main Bazaar line. I thought I heard one of the locals say something about a dorm, but I couldn't find it and didn't want to waste too much time looking for it since I only had half a day in Bomdila. Ended up settling into the Yatri Niwas located in the Main Bazaar for Rs 200 which was the cheapest place I could find. The owners were extremely friendly and the room was fine. There are several other places to stay in the bazaar area and also near the sumo stand area. After realizing I might be heading to the next place over the weekend, I decided to find the Deputy Commisioner office to get my ILP for Itanagar just in case. The folks here are very friendly and nice, but aren't setup for tourists. As a result I was asked to find someone in Bomdila who would sponsor my application and provide a copy of their ID along with mine. Luckily the owner of my hotel was kind enough to oblige. Rs 20, 2 hours, and zero photos later, I had my ILP for Itanager. I was glad I stopped in Bomdila because it gave me a chance to give my legs and lungs some exercise before the higher altitude of Tawang. Being the district capital and with some good schools here, there seemed to be people from surrounding districts also here studying or visiting. Skip the Rs 100 taxi to the upper Gompa and instead take the shortcuts the locals do up to the Gompa. I happened to find a local school boy who was heading home near the Gompa who took me along. Made for a nice chat and it was an easy walk to the top. After watching the young monks prepare the oil candles, I visited the main monastery with beautiful paintings outside, where the older monks were getting the place ready for evening prayers. There is also a guest house nearby with double rooms only for Rs 650. After soaking in some of the scenery on top, I made my way down to the middle and lower gompas. I then took a stroll through the main bazaar to fill up on some delicious food and peek at what some of the local shops were selling. A quick walk up towards the DC office revealed a local park nearby where the locals hang out allowing for some good people watching. This place has some pretty flowers, lots of prayer wheels, and some views of nearby areas. There is also a small museum nearby that was unmanned, but worth a quick visit. Running out of things to see and do, I decided to head towards the place locals referred to as 5-mile (on the road towards Tawang) which offered some good views of the terrace farming on the mountains. With a couple hours of sunlight still left, I decided to go towards what looked like a small golden gompa on one of the nearby mountains. This ended up being a really nice loop hike (easy to moderate if fit). From the main bazaar line, head away from the city and you will see it (also in the picture below). The road to the first monastery was easy to find and follow. This is a newly constructed monastery with freshly painted walls and beautiful paintings. Along the way I met people from Bhutan who were brought in all the way to construct and finish the gompa and its paintings. Facing the new gompa, go towards the right side and at the back you will notice a path. Following that path led me towards the gold colored gompa further up. This path isn't used that often and is quite slippery when wet. It is also steep in sections so use caution. About halfway I reached a house from where I got great views of Bomdila and after a quick chat with the locals who were busy constructing something, I continued on. From the house the path isn't obvious, but again go around the house to the back and scramble up a bit towards the prayer flags and the route will become obvious. Don’t take the herd path that seems to be heading down since it peters out after a bit. After more slipping and sliding, the fog rolled in just as I reached the top. Unfortunately for me the Llama wasn't there so I didn't get to visit inside and could only see the big prayer wheel outside. I met some construction workers who were building a new section of the gompa and were heading back towards Bomdila via a different route so I decided to follow them and this led me right back to the upper gompa making a great loop. Having spent too much time in the plains before this, I was tired enough to call it a day and head back for some dinner and rest. Tawang : The next morning I caught the sumo towards Tawang for Rs 500. The journey had some beautiful spots along the way especially at one of the breaks which was in a beautiful valley with a river nearby and horses (tame and wild) all around. Unfortunately it was quite a foggy day with the Sela pass and lake offering no views. After walking up and down trying to find a cheap place to stay in, I finally found Hotel NEFA (which is one of the first hotels on the way into town) where I discovered a 4-bed dorm for Rs 100 that I ended up taking. Walked around the markets and met a group of tourists planning to visit the Bumla Pass the next day and were willing to let me tag along in their vehicle. The DC office however denied their request for the pass stating that they would have to hire one of the local vehicles instead. At a cost of Rs 3000, everyone turned it down and there went that. In the evening I made my way towards the war memorial and hung around waiting for more people to show up so they would play the film. Foggy days are not the best for viewing since the screen is outdoors, but it gave me something to do in the evening. Got back into town around 7:30 to find almost everything shut down and just one restaurant offering meals. The big tourist restaurant with the lights is open till later, but much more expensive than the local joints. After visiting the small vegetable market in the morning, I made my way up towards the Tawang monastery. If walking, avoid taking the long road and ask around for the shortcut that will help cut down a good chunk of the distance to be covered. Got there in time to watch the young monks at the school getting ready for morning assembly. After watching them give some speeches, say prayers, and sing the national anthem, I moved onto the main gompa which was beautiful. After admiring the paintings outside, I spent some time looking at the various items inside the gompa including the various butter lamps and carvings. I seemed to have missed the morning prayers since all the Llamas were enjoying their breakfast. While I waited for the nearby museum to open, I watched a local Monpa with his pointy yak hair hat praying while rotating the wheel. The museum was nice, but for me the most interesting part were the photos on the upper floor that included ones of the Dalai Llama during his escape from Tibet among others. The monastery complex is quite huge and has several buildings to house the various residents connected by narrow passageways. Being a Saturday, the young students were busy cleaning the grounds and picking up trash and weeds under the supervision of one of their teachers. He turned out to be one of the many wonderful people I met during my travels. He was the philosophy teacher having studied, travelled, and stayed in different parts of the world. He took me on a tour of the grounds including the extensive library containing everything from books on Buddhism to comics for the children, and the Tibetan style pharmacy where they dispense various medicinal herbs that are prepared in small round tablet form. It was wonderful talking to him about so many different topics especially around religion. He was well versed on many topics and a very well-spoken man. From the main monastery we headed down to the Uragayaling monastery which was the birthplace of the 6th Dalai Llama. There were several unique items here including impressions, and handprints. The sandalwood tree and the story surrounding it was very interesting to hear. I was invited to his house for some tea and enjoyed playing with the young girl and marvelled at his gardens where they grow fresh fruits and vegetables. He also happens to have a guest house and while I didn’t stay there, I wanted to provide his information for others who will end up travelling in the area. It is located near the Uragayaling gompa about 2km from town and includes facilities such as attached bathrooms with running hot water, tv, and car parking space. Knowing the person behind the place, I would highly recommend it especially if you are looking for something out of the main town with a quiet and relaxed atmosphere and an incredibly knowledgeable host: Tenzin Paying Guest House P: 03794-222893 M: 09436630456 After more discussions, I decided to head up towards the Rigayaling monastery and then back towards town. In town I met up with a local shoe store owner who I had befriended during my sumo trip from Tezpur to Bomdila. He took me to the Khirmi gompa (sp?) which was in a beautiful setting and afforded great views of the valley below. We were in time for the evening ceremony which included lots of music and chanting and was great to be a quiet observer watching it all happen. The shortcut walk back to Tawang was my favorite walks in the area as it takes you through local houses and gardens, with small prayer wheels along the way and great views of the valleys. I wouldn’t have found this route by myself so it is hard to describe the start and end points especially since maps aren’t detailed enough, but best bet is to get to the monastery by road and then ask the locals there for the shortcut way back to the town. While I had originally planned on catching the bus towards the village of Lumla in the morning, I was told not to do that and instead head back to the monastery as there would be a ceremony the next day that occurs just once in three years and all the Monpa folks would be there. I was lucky he told me about the event because nobody else had mentioned it. I woke up late thinking the festivities didn’t start till 10 and then found out it starts earlier so started moving quickly towards the monastery. Having been there the day before, I knew the route and was making good time. There were so many people and vehicles heading towards the monastery with every car, van, jeep filled with Monpa’s dressed in traditional clothing from all the surrounding villages coming to witness and take part in the ceremony. I caught up with a family who turned out to be from Lumla and made me really glad I didn’t end up at Lumla with everyone from the village here in Tawang. We walked up to the monastery and the outside was like a party atmosphere with vendors setting up to sell toys, clothing, food. One day before I was the only person walking these grounds and today there were hundreds. We walked inside only to be greeted by a long line of people. We patiently stood in line while it moved ever so slowly and watched people returning after receiving blessings. There were some people ignoring the line who I assumed were special since nobody in the line seemed to mind, but this made the line move even slower. Fast forward an hour later when more and more people were taking the shortcut and the police were just being stupid waiting till they reached the top to tell them to join the line which meant the line wasn’t moving. Another 30 mins later, the people in the line finally got tired of watching others break the rules and get rewarded rather than punished and all hell broke loose. Hundreds of people now all pushed their way up the stairs towards the monastery. The police were being stupid again forcing people in one at a time at the door without first trying to get them to line up and this led to everyone at the door trying to squeeze in. The poor babies wrapped around their mothers backs had it the worst and eventually we were all pushed inside one at a time. I later found out that some people believe that by making more effort, they will receive more rewards and that is why they forcefully push their way through making things worse. The line inside went first to a display which contained thumb impressions of Buddha, and then onto the main Llama who was offering blessings and a sacred thread, and finally at exit a snack, bun, and tea for all who survived. Outside the main prayer hall it was great to meet and talk to the various Monpa people from all the neighbouring villages. Everyone was so happy to have made the journey and were enjoying some time with family and friends. After spending a lot of time talking and interacting with various Monpa families, I was told about a second event happening at the Ani gompa where a Rinpoche from Singapore was offering blessings there and pretty much everybody who was at the Tawang monastery were heading that way, while those at the Ani gompa were heading this way. There is a cable car that runs between the two gompa’s, but it was either not working or busy given the number of people around. So I decided to walk to the Ani gompa and simply asking for directions along the way quickly led me to the shortcut in that direction. I wasn’t alone in making this trek and walked past several groups and families. This was another beautiful walk and I highly recommend it for anyone planning on visiting the two gompas as it is easy for a fit person. Several people were curious to see an outsider taking this path and were quite happy to know I was going to witness the ceremonies and offered further information and shortcuts to take. I wasn’t clocking the walk but it took maybe 45mins to an hour to get there and it was a smaller venue with a good number of people waiting for the Rinpoche to finish lunch and start the ceremonies. The Ani’s were very kind, offering the people tea and also lunch for any who had not eaten. The Rinpoche was speaking in Tibetan and a man was translating for the locals, and it turned out that man was none other than the philosophy professor I had spent the previous day with. After watching the locals get their blessings, I headed back into town to plan the next day’s activities and have dinner with my local friends. After dinner I had a chance to reflect upon the great last couple of days and an awesome start to this trip. I got lucky enough to make some amazing local friends, witness a local ceremony, interact with several people of the Monpa tribe, and had some great hikes filled with scenery connecting various places. I ended up deciding my next leg of the journey and would start my way towards the Itanagar - Ziro route early in the morning. Itanagar - Ziro Itanagar: From Tawang I took the morning sumo back to Bomdila reaching around 2:30 pm with plans to take the night super bus to Itanagar and save some time and money. With the night super set to leave around 6 pm and arrive around 10 am, it seemed to make the most sense at Rs 500 per seat. Unfortunately not booking in advance meant all seats except the last row were filled up and having had an absolutely terrible time on the last row of a bus travelling from Kailashahar in Tripura to Shillong in Meghalaya, I decided against it. I found there was a sumo leaving at 3 pm for Rs 650 that would get there around 4am. I took the ticket and was off on my way to Itanagar. Most of the night was uneventful and I realized that while the map showed a route via Seppa to Itanagar, the actual route everyone takes is back down to Assam and back up to Itanagar. This would be the first of many instances where the map turned out to be useless at planning routes, but I wasn't complaining since nice roads were a welcome relief when trying to sleep my way there. Most of the journey was uneventful until we hit the checkpost for entry into Papum Pare. At first everything was going ok, except the driver failed to mention there was a non-tribal in the vehicle and that raised some flags in the policeman's head. After checking my papers, he quickly looked up at the luggage rack and started asking about a bag he saw. Some answers were given, but he wasn't satisfied and then I heard the young man I was sitting next tell the driver he had \"stuff\" in the bag and asked if he would help see if the police would take a bribe. We were all kicked out of the sumo and after further questioning he admitted to having some local drugs in the bag. At first they were angry and threatened to call their superior etc, but soon they ended up releasing everyone including the culprit after just confiscating his bag. On the way the young man just laughed and said they left his other bag with \"stuff\" in the sumo and that they do this just earn some money along the way and never take action. His plan was to come in the morning with his people, pay them off and take the other bag as well. Brilliant.
