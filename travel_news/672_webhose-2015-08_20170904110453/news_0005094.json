Limited edition of DMRC publications will also be made available for sale from the Metro book shop.\nThe Bookshop was formally inaugurated by Shri Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari, Chairman of the Sahitya Akademy in the presence of other senior DMRC and Sahitya Akademy officials. DMRC has already opened two Bookshops in association with National Book Trust at Kashmere Gate and Vishwavidyalaya Metro stations in 2014.\nDMRC in recent times has taken up the initiative of tying up with various government bodies/organizations (National Book Trust, Delhi Tourism, Sahitya Akademy, India Habitat Centre, Ministry of Textiles etc.) authorizing them to use the Metro premises in such a way that they are treated as a hub for promotion of Indian Art, Culture, Literature, Craft, Tourism etc.\nSource:-DMRC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:15:38.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
