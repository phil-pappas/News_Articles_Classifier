Disney Cruise announced that it will tighten its rules on September 30.\nOnce the rules are in place, guests won’t be able to bring any liquor or spirits onboard at embarkation or after port calls exception being allowance for two standard sized bottles of wine or champagne, or six 12 oz. bottles or cans of beer.\nAs before, beer and wine is limited to guests over 21 and must be transported in carry-on luggage and not checked bags. It cannot be consumed in public areas of the ship, except for the main dining room where a $25 corkage fee will apply which is $5 more than the present fee.\nCommenting on the reason for the change in policy, a spokeswoman for Disney said the line periodically reviews its policies and that the new rules aren’t unusual in the cruise industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:09:32.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
