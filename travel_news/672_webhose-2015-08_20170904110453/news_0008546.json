They also allow parents who hold them dear to take their own children to parks and re-experience them through their children's eyes. Some parks span many generations and have been helping to make memories for decades. Let's count down the 10 oldest amusement parks still operating in the USA. \nSome of the places that we now call amusement parks (or their close cousins, theme parks) started out as picnic groves and didn't have any amusement rides until many years later. Some, such as Salem Willows are tricky to qualify. The Salem, Mass. site opened as a city park in 1858, evolved into a small amusement park, but shed most of its rides through the years and barely qualifies as an amusement park today. Others, such as Coney Island in Brooklyn, N.Y., are a collection of amusement parks and standalone attractions operated by independent vendors, many of which have opened and closed through the decades. \nWith the exception of Coney Island, which deserves recognition for its prominent role in the history of the amusement industry, the following list focuses on places that are defined, enclosed parks and that have roller coasters, carousels, and other rides that are typically associated with amusement parks. All of them date back to the 19th century. Their carousels have been spinning a long time. \n1846: Lake Compounce – Bristol, Conn. The oldest, continuously operating park in the country, Lake Compounce is one of the places that began as a picnic park. (Mechanized amusement rides such as roller coasters didn't exist until the latter part of the 19th century.) In 1895, a railway company added a station at Lake Compounce. It is one of a handful of remaining trolley parks, so named because streetcar operators placed the parks at the end of their lines to boost weekend business. \nLike most older parks, Lake Compounce doesn't dwell on its history. Nonetheless, there is a palpable and authentic sense of nostalgia along its midways, and it is a living piece of Americana. Older attractions such as the circa-1927 Wildcat roller coaster and the Antique Carousel, which was built in 1898 and moved to the park in 1911, offer tangible ways to experience its rich past. But Lake Compounce has plenty of contemporary thrills as well, including Boulder Dash, one of the country's best wooden coasters, and Crocodile Cove, a full-featured water park that is included with admission. \n1870: Cedar Point – Sandusky, Ohio Located on the shores of Lake Erie, visitors have been flocking to Cedar Point's beach for years. Guests used to arrive by boat. Today, cars are the preferred mode of transportation, and roller coasters are the preferred form of entertainment. Known as \"America's Roller Coast,\" the park's first scream machine opened in 1892. It is now home to a collection of 16 wild roller coasters, including the 420-foot-tall and 120-mph Top Thrill Dragster. My, how times have changed. \n1870: Six Flags New England – Agawam, Mass. There were no Six Flags parks in the 1800s. Six Flags New England began as Gallup's Grove and evolved into Riverside Amusement Park in 1912. It offered The Giant Dip that year, the park's first roller coaster. Riverside adopted the Six Flags name and brand in 2000. Aside from the Thunderbolt coaster, which opened in 1941, and some minor remnants of the park's past life, there is little that remains from the pre-Six Flags days. Instead, Six Flags New England is now known for its thrills such as the well-regarded Bizarro and Wicked Cyclone coasters. \n1878: Idlewild – Ligonier, Penn. Geared to families with young children, Idlewild is one of the few parks that wholeheartedly embraces its past. It is filled with classic rides such as the Rollo Coaster, which first opened in 1938, the Merry Go Round, a lovely carousel that has been spinning rides at Idlewild since 1931, and the circa-1939 Whip. It also has a charming Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, which is themed to the television show of the same name. \n1879: Seabreeze – Rochester, N.Y. Another trolley park, passengers initially took the ride to Seabreeze on Rochester's outskirts to dine in its picnic areas and swim in its lake. Among the small park's four roller coasters are the Jack Rabbit, which first started hopping in 1920, and Bobsleds, a junior coaster that opened in 1952 with a wooden track but was converted to a steel track coaster in 1968. \n1884: Coney Island – Brooklyn, N.Y. The birthplace of the modern amusement park as well as the first roller coaster (the Gravity Pleasure Switch Back Railway, which opened in 1884), Coney Island is still chugging away. Its heyday has long since past, but potent reminders remain, including 1927's Cyclone, arguably the world's most famous coaster, and the iconic Wonder Wheel, which opened in 1920. More recent additions, such as 2014's Thunderbolt coaster, have breathed new life into the legendary amusement area. \n1884: Dorney Park – Allentown, Penn. Originally a fish hatchery, Solomon Dorney converted his estate into a family attraction and initially offered a zoo, refreshment stands, and a hotel. It evolved into a trolley park and its owners added The Scenic Railway coaster, a Ferris wheel, and other rides as well as a dance pavilion and other attractions. Today, wild rides such as the hypercoaster, Steel Force, predominate. But visitors can still ride ThunderHawk, a wooden coaster that dates back to the trolley park era. \n1886: Coney Island – Cincinnati, Ohio Nope, not that Coney Island. This one is located in Ohio and presumably adopted its name to trade on the popularity of the New York landmark. After working up a sweat on the Python coaster and a nice collection of classic spinning rides, visitors can cool down in the humungous Sunlite Pool. Opened in 1925, the two-acre pool is the largest in North America. \n1886: Lagoon – Farmington, Utah Mules provided the power for Lagoon's first carousel. Its circa-1893 mechanized carousel still spins today. In 1899, Lagoon introduced a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride that sent riders plunging into the park's pond. Today, the park has a nice collection of 10 roller coasters including one that dates back to 1921. The cleverly named Lagoon-A-Beach water park is included with general admission. \n1889: Arnolds Park – Arnolds Park, Iowa One of the few remaining free-admission amusement parks in the country, visitors pay per ride – just as guests have been doing at Arnolds Park for decades. The popular place inspired the name of the town in which it is located. Opened in 1930 as the Giant Dips, the wooden coaster now called The Legend still sends riders racing through its figure-8 course.
