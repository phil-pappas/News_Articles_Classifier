The formerly vacant Albert Road property has been transformed into a 138-bedroom hotel following a £12.4 million development carried out by Ashall Projects, assisted by Middlesbrough Council. \nJust over a year after build work on the project began, the hotel’s enthusiastic team was delighted to welcome its first ever guests, including Middlesbrough’s mayor who cut the ribbon to officially launch the venue. The UK’s largest independent hotel management company, Redefine|BDL Hotels, which currently manages 69 properties across the UK, will operate the hotel. It is hoped that Holiday Inn Express Middlesbrough will become a popular destination for sleeping, eating, drinking and socialising in the town. It includes a bar, two meeting rooms and single, double and family bedrooms. 20 jobs have been created at the hotel, including roles in the front of house, housekeeping, waiting and maintenance teams. The team was assembled following a recruitment fair in partnership with Middlesbrough Council, which was held at Middlesbrough town hall in June. Ross Morrow, Chief Development Officer at Redefine|BDL Hotels, said: “It’s wonderful to see this fantastic regeneration project come to fruition and for the first guests to walk through the doors at Holiday Inn Express Middlesbrough. “The hotel team is full of enthusiasm for welcoming guests to experience the hotel and delivering an outstanding venue in the heart of Middlesbrough. We are very proud to add the hotel to the Redefine|BDL Hotels portfolio.” Mark Ashall, director of Ashall Projects, said: “We are very pleased to complete this important regeneration project on time and within budget. We are very grateful for the contribution of the professional team, the contractor Bowmer and Kirkland and the Council in achieving this result and are confident that the new hotel will go from strength to strength.” The Cook and Endeavour House building in central Middlesbrough had lain vacant for more than 15 years before the regeneration project to convert it into the Holiday Inn Express began last year.
