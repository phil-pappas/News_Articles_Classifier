PSA is an exclusively a regional carrier for American Airlines , which in July flew the second-fewest passengers from CVG of any of the major airlines – Delta, Frontier, Allegiant, United, U.S. Airways and Air Canada – that use the airport. That will change, of course, when American’s merger with U.S. Airways is complete in October . “These are going to be American mainline planes in that hangar,” said CVG CEO Candace McGraw . “It’s not out of the realm of possibility that when an airline schedules planes to come in for maintenance that they also work those into their regular rotation of flights. I’m hopeful that’s what they would look at doing in this case or would look at doing it in the future. That could lead to some additional flights because airlines are looking for flight efficiencies.” PSA will have a five-year lease on the hangar, with a five-year renewal option. American has daily direct flights to and from CVG from its main hubs – O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, Dallas, Miami and JFK International Airport in New York City. If American did expand its offerings, McGraw wasn’t sure whether it would look at adding more flights to those destinations or other non-hubs. CVG has garnered a lot of attention over the past three years for attracting ultra-low cost carriers like Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines, but the airport’s air services team talks to all airlines regularly about increasing flights. “We certainly want to maintain a good, healthy base of legacy carriers,” McGraw said. “How we’re approaching air service is an offering for each passenger segment, so everybody can find the type of trip they’re looking for, the price point they’re looking for.” \nWant Cincinnati Travel news in your inbox?
