There are few roads and those are narrow and wind through valleys and mountain passes so traffic can be a real problem during July and August. Go, if you can, in spring or autumn, when the color of the landscape is at its best. \nWinter also has its charms - there is little snow, except on the highest ground and the lakes don't usually freeze. Steamers on Lake Windermere and Ullswater cruise all year round. \nKeep in mind though that winter fell walking is only for well equipped walkers with plenty of experience. Some of the higher road passes can ice up in winter. \nFive More Cool Things to Do in the Lakes: Visit a great garden - Try the National Trust gardens at Acorn Bank or Sizergh Castle Snoop around a house - like Arts & Crafts influenced Blackwell or the 400-year-old farmhouse, Townend Sniff out some fish - at the Aquarium of the Lakes Go underground - at Rheged , the world's largest grass roofed building, a tourism center with shopping, exhibitions, family fun and loads of movies about the Lake District on a giant screen. Make your mark - at the Derwent Cumberland Pencil Museum charting the history of the pencil from the discovery of Borrowdale graphite in the 1500s.
