The number of bookings from mid-eastern countries has climbed about 5 per cent this year, he said. \nSince British mountaineer Edward Whymper and his team scaled the Matterhorn 150 years ago, the Swiss tourism industry has typically focused on welcoming European guests. The franc’s strength against the euro in recent years has forced establishments to change course and target visitors from elsewhere. In Geneva, where Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd built a summer palace 35 years ago, the Grand Hotel Kempinski and the Mandarin Oriental have Arabic websites. The sames goes for the Splendide Royal’s menu, which features Lebanese wines and rose water pudding. \nVisa rules \nIn Switzerland, the number overnight stays by guests from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates almost doubled to 725,000 between 2011 and 2014. \nWith the franc up roughly 13 per cent against the euro so far this year, hoteliers and restaurant owners are complaining of tough business conditions. The sector, which employs 210,000 people in a country of 8 million, has for years faced declining numbers of guests due to the strong currency. The central bank’s decision in January to remove its cap on the franc of 1.20 per euro has only exacerbated the problem. \nIn a move that is likely to boost tourism, the Swiss government eased the visa rules for Emirati citizens on tourist trips in June. \n“Developing nascent markets is helping to compensate for the declining numbers from Europe — but it’s not offsetting it 1 to 1,” said Daniela Baer, a spokeswoman for the Swiss tourism board. \nBig Spenders \nMore than half the overnight stays in the first six months were derived from European visitors, according to Swiss statistics office data published on Tuesday. Chinese made up 5.9 per cent, while the Gulf region accounted for 2.4 per cent. The total number of overnight hotel stays of foreign visitors declined 1.9 per cent in the first half, the data showed. \nIt helps that visitors from the Gulf tend to be big spenders. They spent 430 francs (RM1,725) a day on average in 2013, according to the most recent tourism board data available. That dwarfs visitors from India spending 240 francs per day, or Russians at 230. Germans, by contrast, spent 140 francs and the Dutch 130 francs. \nSarah AlDuiwaisan, 20, a student from Kuwait City, regularly visits Switzerland with members of her family, including her parents and aunts. They own a house in nearby Evian, France and spend their days in Geneva and touring sites such as Lausanne and Montreux. \n“I’ve come to Switzerland every summer since I was a baby,” she said, enjoying the sunshine near Lake Geneva. “We relax, we take in the view. It may be more expensive but for us it’s well worth it.” — Bloomberg More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:54:03.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
