We've not been told what is going on but we've got an emergency landing.\" The moment our plane had to perform a 180degree turn at the end of the Shemya runway before heading to Anchor #CX884 pic.twitter.com/FbELNEPKSc — Ethan Williams (@eth_will) July 30, 2015 \nCabin crew can be heard telling passengers to remove their shoes and store their jackets under the seat in front of them. \nThe footage shows Williams putting his life jacket on, as a crew member is heard instructing passengers on the \"brace\" position. \n\"We've started to descend. We're flying from Hong Kong to LA, so I don't know what land there is between there.\" A few moments later the crew announce that they will be making a normal landing and not a water landing. \"That's really good news, but we still don't know why. It doesn't really matter as long as we land OK\". Williams said. And that's touchdown! We've all landed safely into LAX #CX884 — Ethan Williams (@eth_will) July 30, 2015 \nNo one was injured and the jet landed safely, to the applause of relieved passengers.. Ad Feedback \nCathay Pacific confirmed that an equipment cooling fan failed, forcing the flight to land at a remote air base in the Aleutian Islands. \nSmoke was detected around the cockpit area, prompting the captain of Flight CX884 to divert to Eareckson Air Station on Alaska's Shemya Island, the airline said. \"Once again, we apologise to passengers for the delay, but everybody is safe and sound, and that's what's the most important,\" Cathay Pacific spokeswoman Jennifer Pearson said. \"They're now at their destination.\" We all got handed one of these upon boarding. @cathaypacific thank you for looking after us! #CX884 pic.twitter.com/KYyE1HMlld — Ethan Williams (@eth_will) July 30, 2015 \nThe plane was deemed serviceable and left the treeless, tundra-covered island to fly the 276 passengers and 18 crew members to Anchorage, 2414 kilometres away. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:23:06.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
