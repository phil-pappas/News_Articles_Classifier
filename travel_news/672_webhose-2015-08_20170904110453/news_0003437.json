Jigger’s is all about taking the art and craft of cocktail making to perfection, and this in a lovely and cosy speakeasy-style bar. Olivier has a passion for foraging herbs and flowers, and he creates the most amazing infusions with them. Every week he has at least three new creations on the menu. His cocktails are not only works of art but are unique. A place not to be missed.\njiggers.be\nBart D’Hooge\nArt on Graffiti Street The Werregarenstraat. Photograph: Mickaël Van Nieuwenhove The Werregarenstraat, as it is called, is unknown to most people who live in Ghent. Instead, everyone talks about it as “graffiti street”. This picture was taken in April. In the beginning of July, the street was entirely re-painted in order to create a blank urban canvas. If you’re lucky, you might catch some artists doing their thing at night. Re-visits are recommended as the colourful street art is dynamic and will probably have changed the next time you visit Ghent .\nMickaël Van Nieuwenhove\nWalking by de Leie … and to Korenlei, Graslei, Kraanlei De Ajuinlei. Photograph: Esther de Wildeman On a sunny day, I find nothing more relaxing than taking a walk next to de Leie River in the city. It makes me immediately proud of the city as it is alongside ancient buildings. This photo was taken in de Ajuinlei. You can then walk towards Korenlei, Graslei, Kraanlei, and end up near Baudelokaai and Portus Ganda. Another idea is to rent a boat (from Minerva near Coupure) and cruise along the Leie with some friends.\nEsther de Wildema\nCafe, cinema and concerts at Vooruit The Vooruit is a beautiful cinema-cafe-concert venue built 100 years ago by a workers co-operative, and still going strong. The cafe is a great place to hang out but the concert halls are the real gems. Go if you get half a chance!\nJustinBennett\nGhent Belfort, the city’s ancient belfry Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Esther de Wildema Go and see the 700-year-old Belfort, as one of the three towers symbolising Ghent. It is next to Sint Baafskathedraal Cathedral and Sint-Niklaaskerk . It has been well renovated and houses the carillon that is still being played every week! Next to it you also have the city hall.\nEsther de Wildema\nParty till the break of dawn in Club 69 Club 69 is a small but fun and nicely-decorated place to spend your evening. In general it is associated with the cool and hipster people of the town. The music they play is varied: from hip-hop to minimal. My personal favourite is Mister Moustache - he just plays the funkiest tunes.\nclub-69.be\nGlenn Jones\nHave a drink at Mosquito Coast An amazing place to drink and eat. Travellers will love it here – it’s very cosy, has great cocktails and excellent food. The walls are decorated with travel stuff: number plates, airplane stuff … If I was a travel guide and I had to go for drinks or dinner, I’d come here every time.\nmosquitocoast.be\nFrederik Verleye\nA taste of coffee and chocolate Quetzal is a chocolate cafe. Need I say more? Indulge in a milkshake, some chocolate fondue or a delectable brownie. De Mokabon is coffee place that has been around for years and years; its original interior attests to that.\nLauren Van Bever\nSphinx cinema and cafe Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Captainofnoella Vibrant arthouse cinema with lots of festivals, events, premieres and an attractive cafe, with a terrace next-door. It also has “happenings”, serves food and a large selection of cocktails, wines, coffees and Fairtrade drinks. All that in the middle of the historic centre of Ghent.\nsphinx-cinema.be\nCaptainofnoella\nHouse hunting in het Miljoenenkwartier Want to see another part of Ghent with a lot of history? Check out het Miljoenenkwartier (The Millionaires’ Quarter).
