Additionally, guests will be invited to dine at the Osteria dell’Arco restaurant for a three course lunch and enjoy complimentary entrance into the Club 10 Fitness and Beauty Center. The package is available from 1 October to 30 November 2015. \nGuests are taken by private transfer via a Class E Mercedes to the historic town of Roddi in the Piedmont region, approximately 90 minutes by road from Milan, where they are met by a group of ‘trifulao’ hunters and their specially trained dogs, joining them for a two hour traditional truffle hunt through the woods. Guests can then relax over lunch at Osteria dell’Arco in Alba, a celebrated restaurant that offers traditional Italian dishes, including black and white truffles and complimentary drinks. For guests visiting on weekends between 11 October and 15 November 2015, the offer will also include a visit to the truffle market at the Alba International White Truffle Fair. Hunters display white truffles and truffle-based products such as spreads, honeys, creams, butter and preserves on stands which line the streets. This provides guests with the chance to purchase exclusive white truffles and participate in the local entertainment. The package is available for a minimum of three nights for two guests, subject to availability and rates start from €600 for a classic room.
