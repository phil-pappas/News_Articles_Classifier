The loss was recognized as an adjustment to the vehicle-related depreciation expense as part of the Company's vehicle operating expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were RMB61.4 million ( US$9.9 million ), up 73.6% year-over-year, primarily due to increases in employee-related costs such as salaries and welfare expenses, and to a lesser extent, increases in advertising and promotion expenses.\nProfit from operations for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB4.4 million ( US$0.7 million ), compared with RMB13.0 million for the second quarter of 2014.\nNet income for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB699.1 million ( US$112.8 million ), compared with a net loss of RMB2.8 million for the second quarter of 2014. Net income for the second quarter of 2015 included RMB803.1 million ( US$129.5 million ) in gains from sale of cost method investment.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 was RMB126.0 million ( US$20.3 million ), up 59.5% year-over-year, mainly due to the continuously increasing average available fleet size.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 37.1%, compared with 39.4% for the second quarter of 2014.\nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was RMB1.8 billion ( US$284.2 million ).\nRecent Developments\nOn June 24, 2015 , the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement on June 2, 2015 , pursuant to which the Company transferred 100% equity interest in its wholly owned subsidiary Elite Plus Developments Limited (\"Elite Plus\") to Eagle Legend Global Limited, an independent third party, for gross proceeds of US$160.9 million .
