The idea for a book of records initially began in 1951 when Sir Hugh Beaver, managing director of the Guinness Brewery , was unable to find what the fastest game bird in Europe was in any reference book. Three years later he invited twins Norris and Ross McWhirter to create a book of facts and figures, based on the idea of settling pub arguments. Here we round up some of the ways in which the world has changed in the last 60 years - and highlight some aspects that have stayed the exactly the same. What's changed? Most expensive bottle of wine The first Guinness World Records edition listed the most expensive bottle of wine commercially available as a 1949 Feinste Trockenbeerenauslese. This white wine from the Rhine Valley in Germany was said to have a honeyed stone fruit, herb, apple and citrus flavouring and was noted for its longevity. In 1955, it retailed for just £8 - though if you wanted a bottle today, it could cost over £600 . The modern day world record for the most expensive bottle of white wine on the other hand, will put more of a dent in your pocket. In 2011, a bottle of Chateau d'Yquem (1811) was sold for £75,000 by The Antique Wine Company. The wine, known as a comet vintage thanks to the Flaugergues comet, was given a perfect 100 points when tasted by wine expert Robert Parker who also praised its \"exceptional longevity\". Highest football transfer fee Jackie Sewell was once a world record breaker, but now Gareth Bale takes the top spot Photo: Rex/AFP Jackie Sewell broke records in 1951 after he was transferred from Notts County to Sheffield Wednesday for an, at the time, astonishing £34,000. Adjusting for inflation, Sewell's transfer fee would be worth around £931,800 today - barely a fraction of the new world record. In 2013, Gareth Bale transferred from Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid for a record breaking £85.30 million. This figure was higher than Cristiano Ronaldo 's initial transfer record fee of £80 million. Before this the highest transfer fee for a British player was Alan Shearer's £15 million after he moved from the Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United in 1996. Highest earning TV stars Jackie Gleason and Sofia Vergara Photo: Reuters In 1954, Honeymooners TV star Jackie Gleason signed what was, at the time, the most lucrative TV contract ever seen. For each episode for the half-hour, once-weekly, comedy sitcom, Gleason earned a reported $65,000 (£41,500). Though this would be a respectable $555,000 (£355,000) per episode today, Gleason's earnings don't hold a torch to what modern day TV stars now bring home. There is some debate as to who is the highest earning TV star at the moment. The Guinness World Records list Ashton Kutcher as the winner, for his healthy $750,000 for each episode of Two and a Half Men. However, Forbes reports that between June 2013 and June 2014, Kutcher took home a total of $26 million (£16 million) whereas Modern Family star, Sofia Vergara earned around $37 million , making her not only the highest paid TV female actress, but the highest paid person on TV overall. What hasn't? Highest grossing movie 1939's world record breaking 'Gone with the Wind' Photo: Photo 12 Despite blockbuster hits such Avatar , Jurassic World , and the Harry Potter series taking the world by storm, nothing has been able to top 1939's Gone with the Wind , which was named the highest grossing movie back in 1955. As adjusting for inflation for films is difficult, since ticket prices and inflation do not always parallel each other, estimates for Gone with the Wind's adjusted gross often vary depending on which source you look at. The Guinness World Records deem its adjusted earnings to be $3.4 billion (causing it to top the list), while Turner Entertainment estimate it at $3.3 billion. Most other estimates tend to fall either side of this figure; some say it falls just below $3 billion , while others suggest the correct figure is closer to $4 billion. The only other films that have come close to besting Gone with the Wind are James Cameron's Avatar ($3 billion), Titanic ($2.9 billion) and George Lucas' Star Wars ($2.8 billion). Undefeated heavyweight world champion Boxer Rocky Marciano in the 1950s Photo: Hulton Archive Known for his incredible stamina and a seemingly cast iron chin, Rocky Marciano is still the only boxing world champion, at any weight, to have won every fight of his entire completed professional career. From March 17 1947 to September 21 1955, Marciano won all of his 49 fights - 43 of which were by knock-outs or stoppages. Many boxing historians rank him as one of the best heavyweight boxers of all time, and his knockout percentage of 87.75 is one of the highest in heavyweight history. Because of his legendary status in the world of boxing, Marciano was in the inspiration for the name, iconography, and fighting style of Rocky Balboa from the eponymous Rocky movie series . Currently, Floyd Mayweather is just one fight away from matching Marciano's 49-0 record. Richest person American multimillionaire John D. Rockefeller Photo: AP When you think of the richest person alive, it's likely you think of Bill Gates or Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helú and you would be correct - respectively they are worth $79.2 and $77.1 billion. But neither have managed to amass the wealth of the current world record holder for richest person ever: John D. Rockefeller . Philanthropist and co-founder of the Standard Oil company, at the time of his death Rockefeller had an estimated personal wealth of around $900 million (£570 million) which would be equivalent to $189 billion (£114 billion) in today's terms. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:14:37.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
