There follows a segment about animals attacking drones, which is gripping.\nAfter a week in Greece , I’ve probably learned only one thing that I’ll remember: that bathos, the literary term characterising the precipitous leap from the sublime to the ridiculous, is derived from the Greek word meaning “depth”. Literally: next to the pool there’s a sign saying “BATHOS – 2.2m”.\nOur holiday has two extra days on the end, because our cheap flights don’t coincide with changeover days. We’re heading for an island on which we have booked rooms at the last minute. I fear it will prove a false economy.\n“We’ll find out when we get there,” my wife tells me, knowing how much I hate that kind of answer.\nOutside, an ancient landscape scrolls by, shrouded in mist. On the TV, a drone flies over an ape enclosure. A chimp stares up at the drone in wonder, then whacks it to the ground with a stick.\nAfter a long walk uphill with our bags, we find our accommodation. The woman who runs it is happy to confirm that fully one of the two rooms we booked is available.\n“But we booked two,” my wife says.\n“Yes,” the woman says, smiling brightly. “There is a problem.”\nShe tells a story, in enthusiastic but hard-to-follow English, about some guests who lost their ferry tickets and became stranded. Apparently mistaking our bewilderment for disapproval, she tries a different story, about a sick child. “The doctor is saying this child cannot go on the ferry, must sleep all day, is taking only pharmacy, and tomorrow...”\nAt this point, a teenage girl – the woman’s daughter, I assume – walks up and starts screaming at her in Greek. The woman acts as if this is not happening. “We try to find the best solution,” the woman says.\nHer phone rings. She answers. “Ah, OK,” she says. “I come. Please await me.”\nShe motions for us to put our bags into a van and to get in. She gets behind the wheel, the girl climbs into the passenger seat and we head off down a twisting road.\n“Is she kidnapping us?” I ask.\nThe woman explains we’re being given alternative accommodation for the night, that our actual room will be ready for us in the morning. All the while she is beaming as if this were the best possible news. “Sorry for my English,” she says to my wife. “You are so thin! Not like me!”\nWe pull up in front of another hotel. The woman who runs this establishment comes to reception in a towel. She is not pleased to see us, but after a protracted discussion, to which the girl contributes a few startling outbursts, a room key is surrendered. Embarrassingly, the woman and her daughter insist on carrying our bags up four flights of stairs while we follow. More embarrassingly, they give up halfway. We take our bags and carry on alone.\nThe room is unbelievably bleak, barely big enough for the bed, with another door letting on to the roof.\n“Do you think there really is a sick child?” my wife says.\n“I want to visit it,” I reply. “I want to feel its forehead.”\nI step outside and am greeted by a commanding view of the whole port at sunset, with white houses and cobbled streets sloping down to the sea. I turn around and see my wife staring at me from a door in a concrete bunker tucked under the water tanks, and I think, that’s how you spell bathos: B, A, Bisected egg, O, Sideways M.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T09:47:35.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
