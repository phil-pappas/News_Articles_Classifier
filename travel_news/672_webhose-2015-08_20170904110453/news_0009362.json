For every New York there is a canyon in a corner of Colorado which barely raises a flicker of recognition outside the state. For every crowded marketplace in Marrakech there is a mountain-framed mosque far from the beaten track in rural Morocco. For every Tokyo skyline, there is a Japanese island awash with art, utterly aloof to the noise of the capital. \nThe images in this gallery represent 15 such places – from the jungle-shrouded back-waters of the Far East to the sandy coastline of Mozambique via the hard edge of Western Australia. \nKnow some of them already? Then count yourself as a well-informed, questing traveller. Unaware of many of them? They are all waiting to be discovered... \n-- \nGunung Mulu National Park (Malaysia) \nTucked into the north of Sarawak – the largest Malaysian state on the rainforest-shrouded island of Borneo – Gunung Mulu National Park is home to one of the world’s most spectacular cave systems. In particular, it is home to the Deer Cave (see above), a colossal rock-framed corridor which is ranked among the biggest cave passages on the planet. You could store a fleet of 747s within – but the main residents are the wrinkle-lipped bats who emerge from the main cavern mouth every evening at dusk – and set off, en masse, to find their dinner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:57:00.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
