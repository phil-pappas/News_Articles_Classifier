Professional sex worker Undine de Riviere says there are advantages to working in flat rate brothels. Source: Supplied \nWANDERING past the sushi bars, shops and churches that line the well-heeled Schöneberg district of Berlin, it’d be easy to walk straight past the King George Club without giving a thought to what’s happening inside. \nOnly a sticker plastered underneath a string of red light bulbs on the venue’s drab grey walls gives the game away, spruiking the club’s offer: 99€ ($145) for all-you-can-drink at the bar and as much sex as you can manage, every day between 4pm and 3am. \nIn a country where sex laws are among the most liberal in the world, ‘flat-rate’ or ‘all inclusive’ brothels like this are a familiar sight, there are at least six in Berlin alone. Some in the capital city charge as little as 60€ ($90). The King George Brothel in Berlin.

She’s joined by a few of her colleagues, who smoke and chat on the bar stools in their underwear. \nOn an average day, six or seven girls will be working, with the numbers rising to nine or ten at weekends. Some of them may have sex up to 20 times per shift. \nOn the surface they appear happy and engaged. Vanessa*, originally from the Dominican Republic, said she largely enjoys her work, which is why she’s been here for 13 years. \nMany of the women, mostly from Eastern European countries like Romania and Bulgaria, consider the job to be transient and short-term — a quick way to save money to send back to their families. However, most have been working in the brothel for at least a year or two. \nAs time passes and tinny chart music blares from the speakers, men emerge after sitting alone at a table or sharing free beers with a friend in the booths and begin to approach the women, with little need for subtlety.

The women are able to refuse a customer if he is particularly unpleasant or aggressive but it’s rare. \nOnce in the bedroom, ‘extras’ are negotiated by the women, who keep 100% of any further money that changes hands. Not much is off limits, with the exception of unprotected sex. The city police and ‘red light police’ check on the women’s wellbeing once every few months, although some doubt the efficacy of this system. \nMost of the men are reluctant to say too much about why they pick this particular place but admit the price point and “unrushed service” are the major selling points. \nSascha Erben’s office lies at the end of the bedroom corridor. Mr Erben bought the club six years ago at the height of the recession in the eurozone, with the intention of opening the city’s first all inclusive brothel. He says that, in a country where there are approximately 400,000 prostitutes and in a city where there are about 500 brothels, he needed a new approach to stand out. Sascha Erben, who owns The King George says he needed something to stand out in a city with 500 brothels.

While he points out that “a woman is not like a casino (pokie) machine”, it’s clear the business model is driven purely by the numbers. \n“I don’t employ top models like Naomi Campbell,” he said. “But I try to keep a balance (in how attractive the women are). I don’t want everyone running to one girl and I don’t want women who (would) turn their nose up at the job. It’s a difficult business.” \nMr Erben says the flat-rate model works from a financial perspective because men over-estimate how many times they can have sex (two or three at most, he said) and want value for money. From the women’s perspective, he says the guaranteed daily pay is the main lure. Of the entrance fee, 49 euros goes to the club and 50 euros to the women. \nEven so, there’s little denying the potential physical and mental impacts such a volume of sexual encounters present. Mr Erben defends it as a personal choice — and recruitment doesn’t seem to be a problem. \n“The women bring the women,” he says. “There’s a lot of publicity and they all talk to their friends about it. \n“This week already I’ve had five girls come to the door — that’s normal because we have a good and clean reputation and they leave every day with money.” The King George has a ‘good and clean’ reputation.

However, Undine de Rivière from Germany’s Professional Association of Erotic and Sexual Services Union says the “internalised stigma” of the job is still a huge issue for prostitutes. \nMs de Rivière has been a sex worker for about 20 years. She now mainly works independently, offering BDSM services for between €250 ($371) and €500 ($742) an hour or up to €1200 ($1782) for an evening. She also works in commercial brothels and at sex parties and has “experienced” flat-rate brothels. Undine de Riviere, who has been a sex worker for 20 years. Source: Supplied \nShe says that despite the public perception of prostitutes as ‘victims’, for many women prostitution is a legitimate career choice and, for some, flat-rate brothels are the best environment to work in. \n“I do talk to a lot of colleagues that tell me about wanting to have another job but they don’t see alternatives and they don’t think they can get a different job,” she said. “But I also know a lot of colleagues who say that the job is totally OK for them or they really like their job.” \nShe added that for some women the lack of competition in flat-rate brothels builds a better ‘team’ environment, reduces the need for self-promotion, makes the language barrier less problematic and makes for a more reliable job. \n“If you are young, attractive and good at negotiating you’d probably be better off in a sauna club or in some other kind of brothel. But if you’re a bit shy — or even if you like that orgy atmosphere that a few of us really do — you can also help each other out in those type of places,” she said. Ms de Rivière represents the German union for sex workers. Source: Supplied \nNot everyone agrees though. Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) have drafted legislation that seeks to ban flat-rate brothels, among other things. \nFor now though, King George remains on the throne. \n*Not her real name", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:03:42.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
