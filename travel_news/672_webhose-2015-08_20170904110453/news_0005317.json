This historical aircraft purchase agreement was signed on the 69th Independence Day of India on the 15th of August, 2015.\nAditya Ghosh, President of IndiGo said, “This new order further reaffirms IndiGo’s commitment to the long-term development of affordable air transportation in India and overseas. The additional fuel efficient A320neo aircraft will enable us to continue to bring our low fares and courteous, hassle free service to more customers and markets and will create more job opportunities and growth. The IndiGo team is even more energised and excited than ever before to herald this new phase of our growth for many years to come.”\nIndiGo placed an order in 2005 for 100 A320s which have all now been delivered. In 2011 IndiGo became the first Indian operator to commit to the A320neo bringing their total to 280 Airbus aircraft. With today’s announcement, IndiGo has ordered 530 A320 Family aircraft with Airbus.\n“It fills us with pride that IndiGo, India’s largest airline and one of the early launch customers for the A320neo, is coming back for more of our benchmark aircraft. This order confirms the A320 Family as the airliner of choice in the most dynamic aviation growth markets. We thank IndiGo and its Co-Founders, Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia for their tremendous vote of confidence,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers.\nThe A320neo “new engine option” incorporates many innovations, including latest generation engines and large Sharklet wing-tip devices, which together deliver 15 percent in fuel savings from day one and 20 per cent by 2020. This is equivalent to a reduction of 5,000 tonnes of CO2 per aircraft per year.\nThe A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with over 11,800 orders to date and more than 6,600 aircraft delivered to 400 customers and operators worldwide. With this order the A320neo order backlog is catapulted to over 4100 aircraft, clearly underpinning its market leading position. Thanks to its widest cabin, all members of the A320 Family offer the industry’s best level of comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18” wide seats in economy as standard.\nSource:-Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:45:53.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
