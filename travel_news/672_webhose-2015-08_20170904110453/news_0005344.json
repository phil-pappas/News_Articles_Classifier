It did. Lights went flashing, she was in a state of shock, winning the car just one week into her new job! She all but drove the car with her Wings on Tour team straight out of Sofitel Sydney Wentworth’s Grand Ballroom and into the night.\nThe Peugeot prize was one of a whole series of accommodation and travel prizes drawn during the evening. Other prizes awarded to lucky guests included two Qantas business class flights with accommodation for three nights at Pullman Park Lane and accommodation vouchers for properties across the region including destinations such as Manilla and New York.\nOver 100 Accor delegates representing over 94 countries and nearly 3,800 hotels were on hand to discuss AccorHotel’s newest product – ranging from the new beach club at Sofitel Fiji Resort & Spa to new midscale Mercure Newcastle Airport and economy ibis Mackay Airport – with the travel industry.\nAttendees were well entertained throughout the evening and a collection of Robert Oatley wines ensured that guests were fully hydrated.Formerly known as World of Accor, AccorHotels Showcase is the largest hotel expo in Asia Pacific. This year AccorHotels Showcase entered its 12th year touring the Asia Pacific region, a milestone for the hotel exhibition series.\nIn 2014, over 1,000 AccorHotels delegates representing nearly 3,600 hotels and resorts worldwide attended the World of Accor series, with more than 7,000 clients in attendance.\nSource:- Accor Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T07:11:29.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
