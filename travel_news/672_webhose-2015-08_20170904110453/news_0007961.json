The Thai government will take measures to ensure safety, restore tourists’ confidence and protect the tourism sector from being severely affected,” Huang told Xinhua.\nMeanwhile, some argue that the number of tourists to Thailand is unlikely to drop to any alarming extent following Monday’s blast, which may simply be attributed to the fact that most will not frequent such specific spots.\nIn particular, the bomb attack will not prompt Chinese travelers to call off their planned visits to the Southeast Asian country where most usually come in groups rather than individually, according to Sitthivat Chivaratanaporn, adviser to the Association of Thai Travel Agents.\nAs many as 28 million tourists, including up to six million Chinese, are expected to visit the country throughout this year.\n“Chinese tour agents made inquiries about the bomb attack but none has canceled their arranged trips to Thailand. Since the shrine is not a main attraction for their group tourists, those tour agents did not look much worried about the situation so far,” he said.\nMembers of the public, Thais and foreigners alike, have been given a stern warning by the ruling Thai military to exercise utmost caution at other tourist- frequented spots in the heart of the capital, besides the Ratchaprasong intersection area, including Patumwan intersection, Silom Road, Sukhumvit Road, Victory Monument and Khaosarn Road areas.\nIn a televised public address, Thai leader Prayut Chan-o-cha condemned the inhumane atrocity of the bombing and blamed it on some unknown, ill-intentioned elements who might only seek to “destroy” the Thai economy and tourist industry by perpetrating such violence at public places.\nThe police are currently investigating the bombing though no perpetrator has been arrested as yet.\nFinance Minister Sommai Pasee has raised concerns over the likelihood of adverse effects on the Thai tourism caused by such untoward incidents and urged those in charge of national security affairs to step up measures to prevent future losses of innocent lives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:03:51.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
