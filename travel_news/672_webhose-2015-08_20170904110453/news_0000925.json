Services included providing live streaming, interactive voting and the recording of all plenary sessions for NHS Confederation. The team also provided AV for the conference dinner which took place at St George’s Hall, Liverpool city centre.\nOther events included Jamfest – which took place in Echo Arena – and support for the city’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Liverpool Marathon, making it the busiest summer period since the venue opened in 2008.\nNicky Norman, senior production and technical manager, said: “We provided production for a series of conference, entertainment and sporting events during the summer which is a reflection of the services, expertise and equipment we can provide for our clients.\n“We are also able to deliver full production for off-site dinners. Through our At Your Service programme, we can provide just one point of contact for our client for their entire technical services – from AV to equipment – at ACC Liverpool and elsewhere.”\nThe team will provide production for a series of forthcoming events at ACC Liverpool includingRenewableUK, CostCutter and UK Stroke Forum.\nMeanwhile the venue, home to BT Convention Centre, Echo Arena and Exhibition Centre Liverpool, continues to invest in technical equipment in addition to enhancements last year which included new LED lighting through the galleria; high-definition projectors and switchers in the auditorium and meeting rooms, and an infrared assisted listening system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:26:47.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
