(Photo: YouTube)\nTags Airports and airfields 341 CONNECT 20 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE There are 14,000 parking spaces at Frankfurt Airport, but if you’d like one that is “bigger, nicer and closer to the terminals,” look for spots reserved for women only.\nThe specially designed parking sections are scattered throughout the airport’s parking garages, can be reserved in advance and should also be very easy to find: just look for the pink ribbon of paint on the floor marking off the wider-than-average parking spots and the pink parking garage walls that have flower graphics and signage announcing “ Ladies Parking .”\nWhile suddenly in the news, the pink parking spaces are not a brand-new feature at Frankfurt Airport. The 250 Ladies Parking spots were introduced at FRA's terminal parking garages in early 2013.\n“In Germany, it is a legal requirement to provide these designated parking spaces for women — with proximity to the terminal entrances,” Frankfurt Airport spokesman Robert Payne told Today in the Sky.\nHe explained that the parking areas are painted pink “for quick and easy recognition by women drivers — sometimes traveling with children — as well as other drivers who should not park here; they cannot say they didn’t notice the bright pink area designated for women drivers.”\nRules requiring women-only parking sections — more for safety than convenience — date back to the 1990s. But today many consider these set-asides sexist.\n“It’s very patronizing for women to be singled out this way,” Geraldine Herbert, editor of Wheels for Women magazine, recently told The Local . And making the spots for women wider than those for men only makes it worse. “Sexist parking spaces” only “reinforce the stereotype that women are bad at parking,” she said and suggested that instead all spaces be bigger to accommodate larger, modern cars.\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \" At the Airport \" columnist.
