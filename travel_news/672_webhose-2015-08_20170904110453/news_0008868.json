We surrounded by do-gooders who object and object, political parties who are afraid to make a decision because of losing out on crucial votes and local villages wanting to protect their environment. Most areas around HEATHROW are congested anyway with roads /haulage and to be honest who wants to live in Hounslow . If you don't want to see expansion, move house, go the country or go abroad!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T02:46:55.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
