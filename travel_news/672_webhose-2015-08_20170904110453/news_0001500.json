They certainly stood out among the 130 entries in the Yorkshire Tea Great Cricket Tea Challenge – hence why they made the shortlist of six for the 2015 title – and, on the day Cricket Tea Challenge judge Xanthe Clay and I visited, served an exquisite tea fitting of a club rich in tradition. Grayshott have played in every edition of the I’Anson Cup since the amateur cup competition began in 1901. They have won the trophy nine times, and in their first success, in 1903, their side included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. As well as creating Sherlock Holmes, Doyle once took the wicket of WG Grace and also set himself alight while batting when a ball struck his thigh and splintered a box of matches he was carrying in his pocket. We bring through a lot of juniors and a few go on to bigger and better things. That’s our main ethos There were no fires during our visit, but the 2nd XI were in a low-scoring thriller against Chiddingfold 1st XI, the I’Anson League division two leaders. Grayshott posted 108 all out in 39 overs, with Andy Lang and David Eales each making 23 and Neil Sampson chipping in with 19. Chiddingfold recovered from 70 for six to win, with Lang (12-5-19-2) and Paul Scanlon (8-1-28-2) the pick of the home side’s bowlers. An army of volunteers dedicates huge amounts of time for the benefit of the club. Graham Sampson manages a youth section, from under-7s upwards, that has 185 junior members and almost 50 coaches and parents involved with the teams. “We’re primarily a junior development club,” Paul Roberts, the club chairman, said. “We bring through a lot of juniors and a few go on to bigger and better things. That’s our main ethos. “And we’ve got a lot of fathers and sons who play in the same teams or different teams within the club. At this level that’s what it’s all about.” “Through the years, from when I first joined 20-plus years ago, ours have been the best teas in our area. I’m personally very proud of the number of chaps that now do teas. It’s probably 50-50 in the 3rd and 4th XIs.” The club also have strong links with local schools. If they win the £5,000 award from Yorkshire Tea, they plan to use it towards creating a second ground. “That’s something we’re looking at now,” Roberts said. “Because we run four adult teams and nine or 10 junior teams, our 3rd and 4th XIs have to travel 35 minutes away to play home games in Lurgashall, Sussex. “We would like somewhere nearby. We’re looking at a place 10 minutes away near Bordon, and that’s our big project. There is a club there now that is sadly in danger of folding and we’ve approached them to upgrade their ground and join forces with us.” Great idea, great club ethos.
