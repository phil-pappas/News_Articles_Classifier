The company specializes in offering the web's widest selection of cigars at the lowest prices. Famous has just released the third in a series of four cigar and whiskey pairing reviews with Dram Cigars for Whiskey Cask #3 and Angel's Envy Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished in Port Wine Barrels in association with their digital cigar and men's lifestyle magazine Cigar Advisor. Cigar Advisor is an online cigar magazine that brings a fresh, irreverent, and down-to-earth perspective on all things cigars to thousands of smokers. In addition to educational cigar content and behind-the-scenes cigar industry articles from some of the business's top names, Cigar Advisor delivers an array of content about a variety of topics of interest to people who enjoy the cigar lifestyle. \nThe Dram Cigars for Whiskey Cask #3 is the third in a line of four cigars that have been blended to pair with the top whiskeys and bourbons in the industry. Each Dram Cask #3 is rolled using an undisclosed combination of binder and filler tobaccos in order for smokers to analyze the smoke on its own without preconceived notions of a tobacco's country of origin being a deciding factor on taste. This secret blend is then wrapped inside of a savory Cuban-Seed Habano wrapper to complete the overall marriage of flavors within the cigar. \nAngel's Envy Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished in Port Wine Barrels is aged for 4-6 years in American White Oak barrels and finished in hand-selected port wine barrels for an additional 3-6 months. The result is a warm spirit with a taste of cherries, oak, and raisins, with a hint of vanilla and honey with a bit of clove spice. This particular spirit was ranked one of the top spirits released in 2010 by The Bourbon Review and Maxim while also claiming the honor of receiving the highest recorded score in Wine Enthusiast Magazine of 98, and a 5 star rating in Spirit Journal . While it claims these top honors, Angel's Envy Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished in Port Wine Barrels comes at a suggested retail price of just $46.99 for a 750ml bottle, and clocks in at 86.6 proof which equates to 43.3% alcohol by volume. For more information on the Angel's Envy Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished in Port Wine Barrels, interested parties should visit www.angelsenvy.com . \nCigar Advisor Copywriter and Cigar Reviewer Jonathan Detore remarked on the Cask #3 \"This was a really interesting pairing. The spice of the cigar is eye opening and certainly catches your attention. Once you get into the cigar a bit, the spice dies down greatly ad opens up into a smoky sensation with spice as a supporting note. Once I tried the Angel's Envy with the cigar, which was a complex and massively flavorful, the spice almost all goes away, and you're left with a mellow sweetness from the bourbon mixed with the smokiness for an unbelievable smoke. This is certainly a pairing anyone can try after a good meal, and should attract both medium and full bodied smokers looking for a great digestif as opposed to an aperitif.\" \nDram Cigars for Whiskey Cask #3 cigars are available at Famous Smoke Shop , and is packaged in boxes of 20 cigars a piece. Each comes in a 6 x 54 Toro vitola with an individual retail price of $10 per cigar.
