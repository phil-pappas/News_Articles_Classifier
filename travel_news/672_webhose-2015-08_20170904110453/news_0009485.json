Maybe Kapteyn b, also known as \"Earth's older brother,\" could be a good option … though it's 13 light years away. Or perhaps the asteroid Ceres, which is close to Mars and Jupiter, but it's cold and dark over there. What about Mars – people seemed to be raving about it as an option 1,000 years ago, right?\nSure, the question is theoretical, but a new exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. hopes to engage young visitors, so future generations can solve this issue. Called \"Above and Beyond: The Ultimate Interactive Flight Exhibition,\" the new exhibit includes 20 interactive stations for children and adults to use to learn more about space and air travel — and the science it takes to get there.\nIn the halls of the exhibit, Chris Ferguson, the commander of Atlantis, the final NASA space shuttle mission, told USA TODAY he hopes children learn from the exhibit and consider a career in air and space travel themselves.\n\"(The exhibit) takes this intimidating, high-tech world and breaks it down that young children can digest and get interested in before they get scared away,\" says Ferguson.\nWhen Ferguson was young, he and his dad would watch the Navy Blue Angels and visit the Franklin Institute, a science museum in Philadelphia. His experiences weren't as interactive or hands on as those available at the new exhibit, but the passion to learn more about space and air travel grew nonetheless.\nUSATODAY\nThe 20 most visited museums in the USA\nOf the 20 interactive experiences, three seemed to stand out to Ferguson and children attending a preview of the exhibit. One station allowed participants to \"launch\" their dreams by choosing which planet, moon or asteroid to move to – which include Mars, Kapteyn b and Ceres, among others – and explore on a hover-board, spacecraft or another device.\nThe children also crowded around a \"Space Junk\" game, where they cleaned debris floating above the Earth's atmosphere using a touch screen. (Ferguson called space junk \"the pollution issue of the future.\")\nPerhaps the most popular part of the exhibit was the \"Full Throttle\" activity, where participants create their own fighter jet and, seconds later, fly it through a series of obstacles – much like a video game.\nJackson Payne, a child who attended the preview of the exhibit on Thursday, July 30, said \"Full Throttle\" was his favorite activity. He said he enjoyed making his own aircraft, and flying it \"so far.\"\nJackson's father, Tim Payne, is the executive director of a D.C. nonprofit called For Love of Children, which provides after-school and summer programs to students across the city. All of the children attending the preview came from the program. Payne said the exhibit provided the ideal fun and educational experience for the students.\n\"This is incredible,\" Payne said. \"The level of interaction and engagement is amazing, and they learn stuff along the way.\"\nNASA and the museum created the exhibit with sponsorship from aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The exhibit comes during Boeing's centennial anniversary, and will make stops around the world. Similar displays will open in Dubai in the fall, St. Louis in 2016 and several other cities, including Chicago and Seattle.\n\"It's about the next generation now,\" said Jenna McMullin, director of Boeing's Centennial Anniversary. \"It's for kids who are excited about innovation.\"\nThe exhibit will stay at the National Air and Space Museum until Jan. 3, 2016, before it moves on to St. Louis.\n51 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1I7Tugg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
