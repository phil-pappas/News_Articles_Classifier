The Driving in New Zealand app will launch next month within the inflight entertainment systems of the airline’s 787-9, 777-300 and refurbished 777-200 fleets. Developed using content from the New Zealand Transport Agency, the app provides top tips for driving in New Zealand such as road rules and conditions. The app will initially launch in English however there are plans for additional languages to be added.\nIn another initiative, a series of new short videos have been introduced this month providing an in-depth guide to driving in New Zealand with various language options. The videos explain New Zealand’s road rules and provide great tips for visitors on driving safely in New Zealand. Developed by CamperMate, the videos are available on the airline’s inflight entertainment system in English, Chinese, French, and German languages.\nAir New Zealand Chief Executive Officer Christopher Luxon says working with partners to ensure visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience in New Zealand is very important.\n“A third of all international visitors arrive in New Zealand on Air New Zealand flights and providing customers on our international services with access to information on driving in New Zealand before they arrive is a great way of communicating important safety messages and playing our part in improving road safety.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:14:21.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
