Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 21, 2015 eTN   \nAir traffic on weekends in and out of South Sudan’s capital city of Juba will effective immediately come to a crashing halt, as the international airport is going to be closed for repairs, according to official reasons given to airlines. Night operations are not possible at present and have not been for decades due to the airport having few navigational aids and no runway lights, so the effective time given in the announcement of 0000 hours Saturday to 2400 hours Sunday is a fluke of the highest order. \nIn real terms, this means that there will be no aircraft movements permitted during daylight on Saturday and Sunday until at least April of next year. In comparison, the busy Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi is only shutting down operations from midnight to 6 a.m. every night for runway resealing. \nNotices by Juba-based embassies are specific that not even urgent medical evacuation flights will be permitted. The same applies for individuals who need to leave the country for reasons of their own, for instance when their visitor’s passes expire and with already two attacks on the road from Juba to the Ugandan border in Nimule, road transport has also become hazardous at best. \nTourism, once a fast-growing industry in South Sudan, has come to a complete standstill, leaving the often extraordinarily large herds of plains game to poaching gangs as there is no more income from wildlife-based tourism and no funds to pay game rangers. The value of the local currency has all but crashed in the absence of significant foreign exchange earnings as oil production and exports have also significantly reduced as a result of shifting battle fronts. To make it worse, the lack of hard currency has threatened the economic survival of two water purification plants where drinking water is bottled and the new SAB brewery which was established two years ago is about to close for lack of imported raw materials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:38:03.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
