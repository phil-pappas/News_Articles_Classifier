The Manchester Taxi Aid Roadshow will take place at Manchester Central on Monday 10 August with drivers invited to pop in at any time between 10am and 2pm to meet with hotels, venues, bars and attractions from across the city region. \nFree parking, refreshments and NHS health check are being offered and there will be useful talks from representatives from Marketing Manchester, Manchester Central, Greater Manchester Police and Transport for Greater Manchester. Manchester Taxi Aid is a charity that was set up in 2012 to promote a healthy lifestyle for drivers and their families. Money raised through organisation of this event will support the work of Manchester Taxi Aid which also raises funds for local charities such as the Lancasterian School. Nick Brooks-Sykes, director of tourism at Marketing Manchester, part of the Manchester Growth Company, said: “Taxi drivers are often the first people to welcome visitors when they arrive in Manchester and that being such, the drivers have an incredibly important role to play in terms of providing information, ideas and recommendations. “One of the key aims of this event is to connect drivers with local businesses that serve the visitor economy so that together we’re providing the best possible welcome; however, the event is also an excellent way for drivers to help support a charity which directly supports the taxi driving community so we hope as many as possible will pop in for a chat on the day.” Local taxi driver, tour guide and co-founder of Manchester Taxi Aid, John Consterdine, said: “The Manchester Taxi Aid Roadshow is going to be a great event to help drivers to engage with tourism venues, find out information about developments in and around the city centre and to learn some important health messages. It’s also an opportunity to help raise much needed funds for the very special Lancasterian School in West Didsbury.” Elizabeth Faulkner, assistant ceo – sales and marketing at Manchester Central, added: “Manchester Central continues to work closely with the city’s taxi drivers and we’re constantly reminded of the great work they do in welcoming our visitors to the city. Delegates often comment on the warmth and friendliness of taxi drivers which really helps give a good impression for those that may be making their first trip to Manchester.” Drivers do not need to register in advance to attend the event and are welcome to turn up whenever convenient between 10am and 2pm.
