Vanderpump and family have recurring roles on both Bravo series produced in Los Angeles. Zip Aviation will fly Vanderpump and guests in a brand-new Bell407GX helicopter, an enhanced version of the Bell 407. Bell Helicopter argues the 407GX is the safest commercial helicopter in the executive charter market, with a full “glass cockpit” providing greater situational awareness to pilots. Garmin’s G1000 “glass cockpit” features two 10.4” high-resolution LCD screens that provide pilots live streaming information on traffic, weather, terrain, systems, and more.\nZip Aviation is donating 100% of helicopter tour and charter profit generated from the event to the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, a state-of-the-art clinic that provides care for cognitive disorders and family members of those who suffer from them.\n“We hope to raise a great amount of money for brain health research, and we are honored to fly Lisa and Ken to such a prestigious event,” said Zip CEO and Chief Pilot, Itai Shoshani.\nVanderpump is featured on the cover of Bella’s July/August Hamptons issue, where she poses for the camera in pink couture with her famous dog Giggy. Her husband Ken Todd will accompany her with dog Giggy to the party of 300 invited guests.\nZip Aviation is sponsoring the annual party for the second year in a row. Last year’s Bella White Party was hosted by Laura Prepon, star of “Orange is the New Black” and “That 70’s show”. Zip Aviation provided her helicopter charter services as well.\nThose who wish to donate can contact Zip Aviation to book a tour or charter in the month of August and mention “Bella Magazine White Party”.
