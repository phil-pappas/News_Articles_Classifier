(OTCQB:BRFH), a manufacturer of frozen, ready-to-blend beverages, is pleased to announce an update on recent business developments. In addition, the Company is filing its form 10-Q for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015, today. Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company's CEO, stated, \"Our first quarter fiscal year 2016 sales increased 173% from the year ago quarter. In addition, sales in the first quarter exceeded the last three quarters of last year combined. Additionally, ordering trends for July and August have continued at a strong pace. Our business model is gaining momentum as we continue to hire sales representatives and achieve wins for our distribution business, and our large national accounts.\" Business Highlights Since our last business update on July 7th, we have added over 500 new customers, and we have begun shipping to 137 new customers during the month of July. We have continued to expand our distribution agreement with the nation's leading food distributor, and our products have now been rolled out to 30 (of the 74) regional locations in 17 states. During July, the Company began selling products to new customers including a regional foodservice facilities operator in the Southeast, a Houston based deli sandwich chain, a number of schools and Universities, and a number of travel and entertainment locations. During the past six weeks, we have begun in-store testing with one of the nation's largest contract foodservice operators, representing several thousand locations. In addition, we began in-store testing with a national snack-food chain with over 300 locations. Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company's CEO, added, \"Our new customer wins in our distribution network continue to grow as our sales force gains experience in working with our distribution partner. Our national account business, which represents very high potential individual accounts, has increased and progressed along the pipeline into in-store testing in a number of cases. We continue to be very well positioned to capitalize on consumer's growing demand for healthier beverages, combined with a format that is easy to use, eliminates waste, and avoids significant up front capital investment for operators.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:49:44.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
