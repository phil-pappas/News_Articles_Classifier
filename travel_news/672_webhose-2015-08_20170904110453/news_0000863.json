Now in its seventh year, the Seychelles Roadshow added a little cultural twist, whereby those present had the chance to enjoy a Sega and Kamtole demonstration by one of Seychelles’ well-known and talented dance instructors, Daniela Rose, who traveled to South Africa especially for the event. \nCalling at Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town from July 21 to 24, trade partners from Seychelles and South African tour operators met a total of 257 agents who were eager to learn more about the destination. This year’s roadshow took another significance, as it cements the healthy 8 percent growth in passenger numbers. This time around, the majority of the agents were new to the destination and greatly appreciated the knowledge imparted by the exhibitors. New tourism products were also showcased in the likes of Le Duc de Praslin, Zil Pasyon, a travel insurance company, and the Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Association (SHTA). Key tour operator partners from South Africa that have been supportive of the destination throughout the years, such as Thompsons Holidays, Seyunique, Holiday Factory, Beachcomber Tours, and Variety Cruises were all present with packages and promotional offers designed to further stimulate sales. The Seychelles Tourism Board’s office in South Africa has increased its marketing activities this year by adding new niche activities to its marketing mix, such as the Bastille Festival in the wine land province of Franschhoek, Good Food and Wine shows, more wedding and bridal fairs, and diving exhibitions. This annual roadshow serves as a reinforcement to these new activities. Taking part in this year’s Seychelles Roadshow, which has now become a highlight in South Africa, were Air Seychelles, Eden Island Development Hotel, Avani Seychelles Barbarons Resort and Spa, Beachcomber Tours, Constance Hotels Seychelles, DMC-7 South, Le Duc de Praslin Hotel, Six Senses (Zil Pasyon) Seychelles, Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Association, Travel Insurance Consultants, Variety Cruises, Seyunique, Thompsons Holidays, Holiday Factory, and the Seychelles Tourism Board. “We were happy to be present at this roadshow for the first time to introduce a quality homegrown hotel establishment on the South African market and the response has been overwhelming,” said Le Duc de Praslin’s marketing consultant, Derek Savy. The Seychelles Tourism Board’s Director for Africa&the Americas, David Germain, said the name Seychelles may conjure exotic images in everyone’s mind here in Africa, but that does not mean everyone knows much about the islands. “It is our mission to create awareness and product knowledge, however and wherever we can, and the roadshow is the perfect platform to execute this task,” he added. “We have given rendezvous to our agents for next year’s Seychelles Roadshow as we continue to maintain this growth momentum and further strengthen the Seychelles brand on the market.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:25:14.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
