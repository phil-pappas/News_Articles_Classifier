The IRS said in May it had determined “unauthorized third parties” used the agency’s \"Get Transcript\" application to gain access to 114,000 accounts. In addition, hackers made another 111,000 attempts that failed to pass the final verification step needed to gain information.

The review also identified an additional 170,000 suspected attempts that failed to clear the authentication processes. The IRS said it will, as it did in May, mail letters to taxpayers who may have been affected by hackers’ attempts to gain access to the IRS system. The IRS will also offer free credit protection as well as Identity Protection PINs. The “Get Transcript” application was shut down in May, the IRS said.

Will Wells Fargo land in hot water over voracious appetite for its own shares? Wells Fargo has invested billions over the years in repurchasing its own shares, even as buybacks gain unfavorable attention from politicians but remain popular with many investors.
