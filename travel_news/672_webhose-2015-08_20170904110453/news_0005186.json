The pilots have held a series of strikes since April 2014, costing the airline over EURâ‚¬300 million (USD$326 million) in lost profit in an increasingly bitter dispute.\nLast month, the Vereinigung Cockpit union proposed concessions, including agreeing to an increase in the average retirement age and lower costs. They said they hoped a deal could be reached by the start of September.\n\"It's very positive that VC has come to us for the first time in years of negotiations with a proposal that includes cost cuts,\" Carsten Spohr told journalists.\nBut he said reaching an agreement by the start of September was unrealistic due to the complexity of the topics involved.\nAnalysts expect one sticking point will be the pilots' request that those working for the Eurowings budget unit should be on a German collective agreement.\nManagement wants Eurowings to have operating costs around 30-40 percent lower than that of its main Lufthansa brand, to be at a level more comparable with easyJet.\n\"(Their offer) has meant that we are in talks,\" Spohr said. \"And only via talks can we solve this conflict.\"\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:24:43.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
