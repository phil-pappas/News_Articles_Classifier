My mother is from Wellington, New Zealand, a proper, soft-spoken tea-drinker.\nBut ask me that question — \"Where are you from?\" — and I hesitate. I was born in Odessa, Texas, but we lived there for only a short time before we moved again. And again. My dad was a Marine, so we lived all over and never in one place for very long.\nIn Texas, we lived in a trailer where I learned to talk — a toddler with a twang — and ride a horse, albeit it was plastic one with springs that Mom set me on top of. I chased after horny toads with my big brother and once came this close to getting bit by a rattlesnake.\nMy drawl was a hit with my relatives in New Zealand, where we moved next, when my Dad went to Vietnam. My mom put me to sleep on a sheepskin rug, which stays cool in summer, warm in winter, and fed me Marmite toast. I had a British accent by the time my dad came back.\nFrom there, we waited in Fairfax, Va., for housing to open up at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. I started kindergarten, learned to ride a bike and jump double Dutch. I got my hand rapped with a ruler by the nuns at Catholic school. On summer nights, my dad bought us rainbow-striped snow cones to eat under the street light. I watched my mom make egg rolls with Kameko from next door.\nBy second grade, we were in Oahu, Hawaii, where I ran barefoot, even at school, and if forced to put something on my feet, wore rubber sandals called \"slippers.\" I ate salted plums and shave ice, learned to hula, and played outside in the almost daily light rain, or \"pineapple showers.\" My parents told us Santa arrived by helicopter in Hawaii, not sleigh.\nWhere your pom-poms were bigger than your head. (Photo: Marilyn Bland)\nAt 9 and 10, in Wellington, New Zealand, I trudged up and down the hill on Maupuia Road to Miramar Central and back, just like my mother had. Now slippers were jandals, a cookie was a biscuit, and ketchup was tomato sauce. I played in the bush, battled weta, and experienced my first earthquake. I ate hokey pokey ice cream and fish and chips. We went to the beach on Christmas Day with Nana and the cousins. My Kiwi accent came back.\nIn middle school in Baltimore, I slogged through snow in black rubber boots to catch the bus and shoveled show (well, at least once — my mom took a picture). I smoked in the woods with my friends — and got poison ivy (karma). I checked the kids I baby-sat for ticks before bed and kissed Michael Wiley on the sky ride at Hersheypark. Now my jandals were called flip-flops.\nAnd then we moved to Arizona.\nHere, I listened to Dave Pratt in the morning on KUPD, tubed down the Salt River, and cruised Metrocenter Mall in my mother's silver station wagon. I ate burritos for breakfast and sang \"The Hepatitis Song\" to the kids I baby-sat. My mom took me shopping at Fashion Gal and Goldwaters; I spent my allowance on cassettes at Tower Records. I have a shiny scar on my hip from a summertime seatbelt-buckle burn.\nWe stayed for high school, and I ended up staying for college, and I stayed again when I got my first job.\nAnd before my son was born, I packed up my apartment, bought a house nearby with a porch and a pool and moved in. I'm still there — even as I type out my notes for this column, sitting at the dining table. (Hooray for telecommuting: I'm wearing flip-flops!)\nSo, where am I from?\nI still love horses. I put my own child to sleep on a sheepskin rug and fed him Marmite toast.\nI still have a bump on my wrist from that nun's ruler. I'm terrible at trivia because I learned the names of Hawaii's royalty, from Kamehameha to Kalakaua, at the time kids on the mainland were memorizing the U.S. presidents.\nYou can hear traces of my Kiwi accent when I cry.\nWhere I shoveled snow - well, at least once. (Photo: Marilyn Bland)\nI'm sitting at my laptop thinking about this now because of that house, and that baby who came home to it from the hospital in the first years of his life. He's 16 now. And I realized a while ago, without ever having fully realized it was coming, that he's a little older now than I was the year I moved to Arizona.\nAll those years I spent in two hemispheres, riding horses and getting poison ivy and shoveling snow — in some ways I worry. I was there, and then there, and then over there. The whole time, he's been here .\nOn the door jamb between our living room and library, there's a record of his entire life — pencil marks on the wall for his height, year by year as it sprouted upward. He has never lived anywhere else.\nI have to wonder: Would I have been any different if I had grown up in one place? Would he be different if we had moved all over?\nSawyer has grown up wrapping cactus in Christmas lights and camping with his mom at the Grand Canyon. He went to Castles 'n' Coasters on a field trip, the same place his mom hung out when she was a kid (it was called Golf N Stuff back then).\nHe goes to Big Surf with his friends, just like I did. We go for Thrifty ice cream at the water-and-ice store.\nHe's never had to walk to the bus stop in the snow, but his cell phone will warn, \"iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it.\" He starts school every year when it's still summer . I'll teach him to drive with just two fingers when the steering wheel is hot.\nHe ate his first solid food at Casa Reynoso — and a couple times a month since — and doesn't think the Mexican food anywhere else is as good. He reaches for a jacket when the temperature dips below 80.\nI push back from the computer, kick off my flip flops and realize something.\nWondering whether I would have been different if we had lived in one place? That's about as futile as wondering whether I'd be different if I had been born to different parents. My mom's sheepskin rug, my dad's uniforms and all the schools and jandals and snowboots were part of the same life, my life.\nAnd Sawyer? He's got his own memories of backyard forts and desert sunsets, and his own mom who took him to Christopher Creek every summer and made him take swim lessons at the public pool down the street.\nMaybe we are each a package deal. Where we come from and who we come from — it's all part of the package. Maybe when we ask where we're from, it's just a way of trying to find a shortcut to who we are.\nHis history is here, in one place. Because someday he will move, across town or across the world. And he will meet somebody new, and it won't really matter whether he ever had snow boots, or whether he got to mark his height on the same wall for his entire childhood. Someone will ask him where he's from. And he'll know.\nReach Bland at karina.bland@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8614.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635744691278674990-FROMIMG-0228.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635744693315281100-FROMIMG-0224.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b3b7af9d57017d476bc98791c2b704ae7819533/c=0-304-2448-2145&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635744691278674990-FROMIMG-0228.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ca8e3c61147d6598407e93cb77d0fb81738e232/c=0-607-2448-2448&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635744693315281100-FROMIMG-0224.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-06T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T22:23:31.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
