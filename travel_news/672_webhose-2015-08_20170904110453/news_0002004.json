Work to completely upgrade the city centre hotel began in January and since then 72 guest bedrooms, meeting rooms, breakout areas, and public areas, have all been transformed and are now sporting a contemporary new look. The hotel's ground floor space has also been completely remodelled, creating the stunning new Fire Lake Grill House and Cocktail Bar - a stand-alone venue within the hotel. \nThe refurbishment is being carried out in two phases, with the first phase, the largest and most significant; now complete. Phase two, which begins in January 2016, will complete the hotel's transformation by refurbishing the remaining 75 guest bedrooms. The hotel's meetings and events space has been restyled as part of the project. All ten meeting rooms now have a fresh, modern look, complete with feature walls, additional sky-like lighting and new audio and visual equipment. Situated over two floors, the hotel’s contemporary meeting space offers adjoining breakout areas and an additional three atriums in the centre; offering an inspired venue option for lunches, networking events or drinks receptions. Guests and meeting delegates also benefit from upgraded WiFi lines into the hotel, delivering fast and free connections for all. \"We are proud to unveil our new-look hotel. This is a significant investment and represents a marked change for the hotel. We are confident that this enhanced product offering, upgraded Meetings and Events facilities, and the new Fire Lake bar and restaurant concept; will help to reaffirm our position as one of this thriving city's leading hotels\" says Malcolm Rann, Regional Director, Radisson Blu Hotels, UK. The use of contrasting warm and cool tones of grey and bronze, with accents of black and white, and the addition of stylish new furnishings; has evolved the hotel's rooms and public areas. Throughout, bold artwork pays homage to the heritage and roots of the destination, with various nods to Leeds and Yorkshire on prints and walls; including the dramatic imprint of Leeds legend Peter O Toole on a wall in Fire Lake. The Fire Lake Grill House and Cocktail Bar is a destination in itself. This industrial chic style venue is a welcome new addition to the food and drink scene in Leeds, boasting an eclectic range of furniture and several drinking and dining spaces. The Leeds launch of Fire Lake, a concept born in Minnesota - the land of 10,000 lakes - marks its first location outside of the USA. Fire Lake combines the mid-west traditions of open-flame cooking and the art of cocktail creation and is all about the flavour of the flame. As many dishes as possible are wood and flame-cooked, or wood-smoked. Food is from the local neighbourhood and often organic, cocktails are barrel-aged, and beers hand-crafted. Meanwhile, the newly designed bedrooms offer guests two modern styles: Naturally Cool and Permanently Blu, and boast new: carpets, curtains, soft furnishings, mood lighting and furniture. Media hubs have been added to support the needs of guests looking for the latest in in-room technology.
