touch down in Gatwick that the sheer array of sensations I experienced in Tuscany crystallize in my mind.\nAt the best of times, there's nothing like the vast, soulless, excessively bright terrain only an airfield can deliver, to send you into an immediate state of the 'post-trip blues.'\nBut that is what Tuscany does to you, more so than any other place I've visited – it turns you into a sentient fiend, unable to detach yourself from it, and incapable of accepting that the place you've just returned to will be in any way comparable.\nAfter cooling off from the 29 degree heat in the Ligurian Sea, John took in the unique vista of the Apuan Alps from the beach in Viareggio\nGrand Hotel Principe di Piemonte is an historic fpur- five-star hotel on Viareggio’s seafront and part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World\nViareggio's sandy beach, a 30 second walk from Grand Hotel Principe di Piemonte, consists of colourful beach deck chairs and umbrellas\nFive days earlier I set off with some fellow journalists to partake in a 'multi-centre' holiday – one of these newfangled, David Brent-esque buzzwords which encapsulates the idea of allowing holidaymakers to easily experience a whole region in one holiday, by combining two or more destinations in one trip.\nAfter touching down in Pisa we headed to the gorgeous seaside resort of Viareggio, courtesy of our car hire for the week.\nDriving alongside the town's impressive promenade, to our five-star Grand Hotel Principe di Piemonte, even the most ardent of philistines would have struggled to appreciate the striking, ubiquitous Art Nouveau/Liberty-style buildings which flank it.\nI will never forget the first of my countless 'wow' moments from the trip which occurred on the sandy beach just a 30 second walk from our supremely positioned residence for the next three nights.\nAfter cooling off from the 29 degree heat in the Ligurian Sea I took in the unique vista of the Apuan Alps – an unbelievable contrast when accompanied with the foreground consisting of rows of colourful beach club flags, deck chairs and umbrellas.\nThe views from the Plaza e de Russie in Viareggio offer a glimpse of the beach, promenade and Apuan Alps\nThe rooftop hydro-massage plunge pool at the Grand Hotel Principe di Piemonte is the perfect place to unwind\nRegina Restaurant's 'Calamarata di Gragnano' (left) consisted of wide ring shaped pasta served with seafood, squid and asparagus tips\nIndeed, the hotel itself, situated in a supreme position on the seafront, boasts sumptuous views of its own from the room balconies and rooftop hydro-massage plunge pool, which I made sure to take full advantage of.\nNot content at merely titillating our visual senses we ate at the hotel's Regina Restaurant, sitting on the classy veranda, which more than made up for missing out on dining at the top floor fine dining restaurant which has been awarded not one but two Michelin stars, due to a pre-booked event.\nSuch was the hospitality of the staff that they insisted we try some of the fine dining courses from said restaurant which we, of course, showed no resistance to.\nOne of which was the 'Calamarata di Gragnano' dish - wide ring shaped pasta served with seafood, squid and asparagus tips.\nSomewhat bizarrely to all of us it was served in a Kilner clip top jar.\nHowever, the familiarity of the jam jar did not match what was inside - a multi-textured taste explosion, the likes of which I can honestly say I’ve never encountered.\nThe first day trip away from the Viareggio base was to the beautiful walled city of Lucca\nDespite being comparatively large in size to some of the places in Tuscany, Lucca lacked any sense of somewhere corrupted by tourism\nIt's almost sacrilege to order any type of cuisine in Viareggio other than seafood but when it does come to the point where you feel yourself developing gills, fear not; quirky local pizzerias such as Pizzeria La Chiesina – where we ate on our third night – exist.\nBuilt inside a converted church, with exquisite pizzas costing between five and nine Euros it provided a welcome change of pace.\nWe took two day trips away from our Viareggio base – the first of which was the city of Lucca.\nA beautiful walled city, I found it to be the most charming place I visited in Tuscany.\nDespite being comparatively large in size to some the places we visited, it lacked any sense of somewhere corrupted by tourism.\nThe serenity of the city provided a fitting backdrop to the beautiful melodies of Puccini which seeped out of cafes of the composer's birthplace.\nRenting bicycles and riding around Lucca atop its famous walls is ostensibly the best way to see the beautiful city\nClimbing to the top of Lucca's most important tower, the Guinigi, was a highlight for John, given the stupendous views it offers\nI would highly recommend renting bicycles and riding around Lucca atop its famous walls. The walls themselves are very big and have a wide bike path, despite my friend and I scarcely seeing another cyclist about.\nDoing so takes around half an hour if you meander at a leisurely place, however, if, like us, you find the expansive views looking out of the city too irresistible to handle you can stop off at the various small parks along the way.\nAscending to the top of Lucca's most important tower, the Guinigi, was a similarly thrilling venture for me.\nIts hanging garden on the roof of the tower is a site to behold, as are the 360 degree views which it offers.\nAlong with the bike ride, the flights of stairs to the top, though admittedly not too physically demanding, allowed me to justify indulging at one of the exquisite gelateria's the city had to offer.\nIn Florence, the glorious medieval stone, closed-spandrel structure was the only bridge spared by Adolf Hitler\nThe next day, the grandeur and enormity of Florence made it really hit home how multifaceted a region Tuscany is.\nWe were dropped off tantalisingly outside the illustrious Florence Cathedral before being told by our tour guide that we would return their later in the day.\nMoving through the busy streets, we were greeted with the smell of espresso and fine leather as we sailed through a blend of high-end cafes, shops and lively markets, passing the famous bronze boar (Il Porcellino) and rubbing the boar's snout to ensure a return to Florence - a tradition that even after just 45 minutes in Firenze I could easily jump on board with.\nA visit to must-see Ponte Vecchio (Old Bridge) on the Arno River followed; interestingly we were informed that the glorious medieval stone, closed-spandrel structure was the only bridge spared by Adolf Hitler during the Second World War, while all the other bridges of Florence were blown up to impede an Allied advance.\nJohn also visited the rooftop of the superb Grand Hotel Baglioni (left) and famous viewpoint square Piazzale Michelangelo (right)\nThe reason being? He just liked it aesthetically.\nFurther research on my iPad later that night suggested that that claim was a famous 'legend of the tour guide' but I'm still willing to believe it.\nWe then shimmied through the famous Uffizi Gallery's narrow courtyard before absorbing the free open air museum (aka Piazza della Signoria) which includes Giambologna's 'The Rape of the Sabine Women' and a reproduction of Michelangelo's statue of David (the original being housed in the city's Academy of Fine Arts).\nAfter learning about the fascinating relationship between the Medici family and the city, we moved on to see the Basilica of Santa Croce before returning to the Cathedral, which defies description – just go and see it.\nThe Castel Monastero Resort and Spa, in the heart of the Chianti region, is a beautifully restored castle with spectacular views of Tuscany\nCastel Monastero also boasts a spectacular wine cellar restaurant and includes luxurious, rustic-style rooms\nOur second base of the trip, was the glorious Castel Monastero, in the heart of the Chianti region - a beautifully restored castle with spectacular views of Tuscany, luxurious rooms, world class spa and... a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.\nJust 23 kilometres from Siena it allowed us to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site – an untouched medieval cityscape bursting with culture.\nSiena's sandstone grounds compliment the many-hued, vast swathes of countryside visible at almost all points due to the undulating nature of the city.\nSiena Cathedral's completely marbled mosaic floor is one if the most ornate of its kind in Italy and it boasts a Michelangelo self-portrait sculpture which is well worth a visit, even if its just to say you've seen it,\nSpeaking to Sienese locals allowed me to vicariously appreciate the rivalry and tradition behind the famous 'Palio.'\nSiena is a UNESO World Heritage Site and an untouched medieval cityscape bursting with culture\nSiena Cathedral (left) boasts a completely marbled mosaic floor and Michelangelo self-portrait sculpture (right) which is well worth a visit\nCastel Monastero offers a cooking demonstration from Contrada's (Gordon Ramsay's restaurant) head chef\nSo much more than a horse race, held twice each year, on July 2 and August 16, it takes place at the city's Pizza Del Campo with 10 horses and riders, representing 10 of the 17 contrade (city wards).\nSuch is the animosity, that friends and couples from different wards rarely talk to each other or even shake hands, in the week leading up to the event.\nWith about 40,000 people going to see the race, it instantly made its way onto my bucket list.\nBack at Monastero, a cooking demonstration from Contrada's (Ramsay's restaurant) head chef followed, in which he taught us how to make his Tuscan specialities.\nOur final full day involved a full day tour of the Chianti Hills in vintage Fiat 500 cars.\nA visit to first generation winery 'Poggio Amorelli' (left) followed a period of whizzing around in the exhilarating 'Cinquecentos' (right)\nIt is an option which travel company Citalia offer and I cannot recommend it enough.\nWhizzing around in the exhilarating 'Cinquecentos' was an experience in itself but to do so in such an iconic setting was remarkable.\nStopping off at Castellina in Chianti, I wasted no time climbing to the top of its massive Rocca (castle) which offered astounding panoramic views of the rolling hills and vineyards for miles and miles.\nA visit to first generation winery, 'Poggio Amorelli,' followed where they showed us how they make their Chianti Classico and Super Tuscan wines, amongst others, before serving us five wines with crostini, cheeses and meats to once more hammer home that quintessentially Tuscan feeling of unrepentant gluttony.\nSomewhat fittingly we finished our trip with use of the Castel's spa, not least the hot, relaxing high saline density sea oil pool (which provides similar floating effect to the Dead Sea) before once again eating from Ramsay's hand-picked menu for the last time.\nStopping off at two-time Gelato World Champion 'Gelateria Dondoli' in the medieval town of San Gimignano, the following morning, preceded a short journey to Pisa airport and and an ineluctable feeling that nothing will be the same again.\nNot until I visit Tuscany again, that is.\nThe views of the undulating, green hills from the top of Castellina in Chianti's 'Rocca' (left) and similar in San Gimignano (right)\nTRAVEL FACTS Citalia is offering a five-night holiday to Tuscany from £785 per person.\nThe offer includes three nights at the five star Principe Di Piemonte on a B&B basis and a complimenatary three course dinner for two at the Regina Restaurant, followed by a further two nights at the five star Castel Monastero on a half board basis.\nThe offer also includes private resort transfers, two nights car hire, and return international flights from London Gatwick with easyJet (based on departures 9 October 2015.)\nwww.citalia.com\nRead more: Italy Holidays | Italian Hotels & Holidays 2015 | Citalia", "external_links": ["http://www.citalia.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1VnoU8w"], "published": "2015-08-30T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:01:26.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
