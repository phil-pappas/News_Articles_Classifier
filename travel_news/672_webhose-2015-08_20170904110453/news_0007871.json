They lie in the Atlantic, about 4 hours flying time from the East Coast of the U.S. and two hours flying time to Lisbon. Azores Islands Map Map of the Azores © 2006 by James Martin, licensed to About Getting to the Azores Islands \nThe nine Azores Islands are served by SATA airlines. International flights arrive at Ponta Delgada on the Azores largest island São Miguel, or San Miguel. During the high season, SATA flies to the Azores from Boston, Oakland, Porto, Lisbon, Faro, Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin, London, Amsterdam and the Canary Islands. If you are coming to the Azores from Lisbon, you can get direct flights to Horta, Terceira and Santa Maria as well as to Ponta Delgada. In the off-season, check SATA for the latest information, as these departures change frequently. \nCompare prices on flights to Ponta Delgada. Getting Around the Azores Islands \nDuring the high season there are flights between the islands. Ferry services can be spotty, and many boats only run for a limited time around the summer season. \nIf you wish to travel to two islands, it's best to make your airline reservations at the same time. In other words, the frugal will want a Boston-Ponta Delgada-Terceira ticket rather than separate Boston-Ponte Delgada and Ponta Delgada-Terceira round trips. Getting Around within an Island in the Azores \nPublic transportation is aimed at Azoreans going to work and the time tables are probably inconvenient for most tourists to the Azores. Hiring a taxi for a half day tour is reasonably inexpensive, and gets you exactly where you want to go. Rental cars are available, and are good to have on larger islands such as San Miguel. There are many walking paths on the islands as walking is one of the attractions enjoyed by tourists in the Azores. When to Go \nThe Azores' stable, Subtropical Climate makes the islands the ideal place to go in the off or shoulder seasons. It's also ideal for folks who want to vacation in summer but don't like intense heat. Go in Spring for the flowers. See: Azores Weather and Historic Climate .
