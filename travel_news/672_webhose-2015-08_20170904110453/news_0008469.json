Adding their views on the monetary aspect, these MICE professionals agreed that although there would be a cap with the budget that could be allocated towards the spending, these decision makers would not shy away from increasing their spend on certain creative proposals and new destinations that could re-invent the way we look at incentives and events.\nThere were also some interesting takeaways with these experts sharing their insight on what works best for the Indian market. Majority of buyers emphasized the importance of inclusion of the employee’s or distributor’s family in the activity to provide an enriched incentive travel experience. Another MICE buyer from a top tier pharmaceutical company enlisted the key factors responsible for a successful incentive activity, with value for money, proximity to India, accessibility, a proactive tourism board and creating a wow factor being the most important. During the highly anticipated visa panel discussion, the topic of ensuring a smooth visa issuance process for MICE rather than only focusing budgets on tourism marketing was highlighted. Bringing it all together, it was observed that corporates make their MICE decisions based on the 3S’s – Spend, Service and Satisfaction.\nSource:-MICE India", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T14:19:22.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
