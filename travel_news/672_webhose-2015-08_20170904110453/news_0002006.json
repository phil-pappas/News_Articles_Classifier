The incident served as a reminder that travelling with hand baggage alone is often cheaper, quicker and easier than checking luggage into the hold. Travelling with only hand baggage is not an unwise move: air passengers have not infrequently experienced delays and extra frustration because of hold bags being delivered late, or not at all, to the baggage carousel. Last year, for example, passengers of four airlines arriving at Gatwick were advised to go home without their luggage due to staff shortages at the airport's South Terminal . Packing a smaller bag, however, is cheaper and usually means you can skip the wait to pick up your belongings at the other end. But airline rules regarding the size and weight of hand luggage vary. Below we summarise, for each UK airline, the size your bag needs to be to ensure you can take it on board for free. Ryanair passengers are allowed two bags in the cabin.

To reduce the risk of this happening, try to arrive at the boarding gate in good time. Some airlines have also announced that taking a slightly smaller bag will guarantee that it travels in the cabin with you. Below we outline the restrictions on cabin baggage for 10 airlines commonly used by British travellers, including information on weight and size restrictions, and whether or not each airline allows passengers to travel with hand-luggage only for one leg of a journey.
