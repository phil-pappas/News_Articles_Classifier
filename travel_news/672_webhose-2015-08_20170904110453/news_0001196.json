Overnight at the hotel. \nDay 02 – At Delhi \nMorning after breakfast at the hotel combined tour of Old and New Delhi - Sightseeing tour of New Delhi visiting Qutab Minar – 234 feet high tower. The Qutab Minar itself is a soaring tower of victory that was started in 1193, immediately after the defeat of the last Hindu kingdom in Delhi. It is nearly 73m(243ft) high and tapers from a 15m(50ft) diameter base to just 2.5m(9ft) at the top. The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony. The first three storeys are made of red sandstone, the fourth and the fifth of marble & sandstone. After visit Bahai Temple or also known as Lotus Temple. Also visit the Tomb of Mughal Emperor Humayun. Built in the mid-16th century by Haji Begum, the Persian-born senior wife of Humayun, the second Mughal emperor, this is a wonderful early example of Mughal architecture. The elements in its design – a squat building, high arched entrances that let in light, topped by a bulbous dome and surrounded by formal gardens – were to be refined over the years to the magnificence of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Drive past India Gate (War Memorial), President’s House, which was once the Viceroy’s Palace, Parliament House and Secretariat buildings. \nOld Delhi - where you will visit Red Fort - The red sand stone walls of Lal Quila, the Red Fort extend for 2 km and vary in height from 18m on the river side to 33m on the city side. Shah Jahan started construction of the massive fort in 1638 and it was completed in 1648. The Red Fort dates from the peak of Mughal power. The Mughal reign from Delhi was a short one. Aurangzeb was the first and the last emperor to rule from here. Jama Masjid- the Great Mosque of Old Delhi was both the largest and the final architectural extravagance of Shah Jahan. Begun in 1644, the mosque was not completed until 1658. It has three gateways, four angle towers and two minarets standing 40m (133ft) high constructed of alternating vertical strips of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard of the mosque can hold 25,000 people. Take a rickshaw ride to Chandni Chowk - the main street of Old Delhi - the colourful shopping bazaar just opposite the Red Fort and visit Raj Ghat - the cremation site of Mahatma Gandhi after his assassination in 1948. \nOvernight at the hotel. \nDay 03 – Delhi to Varanasi – Fly Morning after breakfast transfer to Airprot to board flight for Varanasi. Meeting on arrival at Varanasi Airport and transfer to the hotel. \nAfternoon time permitting excursion to Sarnath - after attaining enlightenment, Lord Buddha came and delivered his first sermon, or in religious language, set in motion the Wheel of Law, Maha Dharmachakra Pravartan. The virtuous emperor Ashoka who later in his life became a strong follower of Buddhism, spreading the message of love and compassion everywhere, visited Sarnath around 234 BC, and erected a Stupa here. After this, several Buddhist structures were raised from the period 3rd century BC to 11th century AD. Sarnath today stands witness to some of the great Buddhist monuments, an important landmark in the history of Buddhist religion. \nVaranasi or Kashi as it was called in the 7th century B.C has been the religious capital of the Hindu faith since recorded time and is one of the oldest cities in the world and a hub of firmly rooted traditions. The old city of Varanasi is a maze of small streets and alleyways, hiding in disorderly array no less than 2000 temples and shrines. Domes, minarets, pinnacles and towers, and derelict 18th century palaces dominate the sacred left bank of the river Ganges. \nOvernight at the hotel. \nDay 04 – At Varanasi Early morning boat ride on the river Ganges, where you can see hundreds of devotees offering prayers to the Sun God, and rinsing them selves of all their sins in this holy river. Return to the hotel via visiting temples and Benaras Hindu University, Durga Temple and Bharat Mata Temple. \nRest of the day at free either to relax or self exploration. \nEvening visit Holy River Ganges \nGanga Aarti at Dasaswamedh ghat, close to Kashi Vishwanath Temple, is one of the prime attractions of Varanasi. It starts just after sunset, with a bunch of young men choreographing to the chantings, holding the lamps. \nPeople start arriving at the ghats as early as 5pm. Dasaswamedh ghat becomes a hub of activity, with people sitting and waiting for the aarti, buying flowers and other things from nearby shops or performing pooja. I sat listening to an attractive old man who narrated Ramayana to a bunch of tourists who were listening keenly. Several babas sat near the ghats, looking for donations Day 05 – Varanasi to Delhi – Fly 1450 – 1620 hrs and drive to Agra \n(Varanasi to Agra has directly flight on Mon, Wed and Sat – If your travel falls one of these days than you fly directly from Varanasi to Agra) Morning time free in Varanasi.

Check into the hotel on arrival for overnight stay. \nDay 06 – At Agra \nEarly morning visit Mehtab Bagh – Spread out lush green Mughal Garden across River Yamuna, to have some stunning views of the Taj Mahal changing colors with the rays of rising sun. \nReturn to the Hotel for breakfast. \nLate morning visit the world famous Taj Mahal Sunset. Taj Mahal - built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal, whose death in childbirth in 1631 left the Emperor so heartbroken that his hair is said to have turned gray overnight. Construction of the Taj, begun in the same year, was not completed until 1653. In total 20,000 people from India and Central Asia worked on the building. The Taj Mahal is like a silent rhapsody that you will carry in your heart. Also visit Agra Fort, constructed by Emperor Akbar in 1695 on the banks of the Yamuna River. Initially the fort was a military structure, but during Shah Jahan’s reign it had partially become a palace. \nEvening witness Mohabatt The Taj show – live dram based on history of the Taj Mahal combined with culture performances from various Indian states. \nOvernight at the hotel. \nDay 07 - Agra / Ranthambore - Drive 6 hrs \nMorning after breakfast at the hotel proceed to Jaipur by car to reach in around 5 hours time enroute visiting Fatehpur Sikri 40 kms (25 miles) before Agra - a cultural and imperial capital conceived and built by Emperor Akbar in 1569 and later abandoned due to scarcity of water. See the graceful buildings within the city including Jama Masjid, Tomb of Salim Chisti and Panch Mahal. \nArrive and check in at the hotel.

Late morning drive to Jaipur and check into the hotel. \nRest of the afternoon / evening at leisure. Overnight at the hotel. \nDay 10 - At Jaipur. \nMorning after breakfast at the hotel visit Hawa Mahal - which was constructed in 1799, the Hawa Mahal or the Palace of Winds, is one of Jaipur’s major landmarks, although it is actually little more than a façade. This five storey building, which overlooks the main street of the bustling old city, is a stunning example of Rajput artistry with its pink, delicately honeycombed sandstone windows. Later proceed to Amber Fort - the ancient capital of the state until 1728. The fort is a superb example of Rajput architecture, stunningly situated on a hillside and overlooking a lake, which reflects its terraces and ramparts. Visit the Jagmandir of the Hall of Victory glittering with mirrors, Jai Mahal and the Temple of Kali. You ride up to the ramp of this 11th Century Bastion atop a gaily decorated elephant. \nAfternoon City sightseeing tour includes Maharaja’s City Palace - which occupies a large area divided into a series of courtyards, gardens and buildings. The outer wall was built by Jai Singh, but other additions are much more recent, some dating from the start of this century. Today, the palace is a blend of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture. The palace now houses a museum containing rare manuscripts, fine specimens of Rajput and Mughal paintings and weapons. Also visit Jantar Mantar- an observatory, next to the entrance of the City Palace, begun by Jai Singh in 1728. Jai Singh’s passion for astronomy was even more notable than his prowess as warrior and before commencing construction, he sent scholars abroad to study foreign observatories. Jantar Mantar appears to be just a curious collection of sculptures but in fact each construction has a specific purpose, such as measuring the positions of stars, altitudes and azimuths and calculating eclipses. \nOvernight at the hotel. \nDay 11 – Jaipur to Delhi Airport Morning after breakfast drive to Delhi Airport (5 hrs) to board homebound flight. \nBon Voyages !
