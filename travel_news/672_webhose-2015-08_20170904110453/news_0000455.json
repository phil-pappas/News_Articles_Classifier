A Zimbabwean landowner named Headman Sibanda was arrested in the case and is assisting police with their investigation. \nThe case is not believed to have been connected to that of Walter Palmer. Local authorities are seeking his extradition, alleging that he did not have authorization to kill the animal. It is reported that Cecil was lured out of Hwange Park and then killed. Two Zimbabweans have been arrested and face charges in relation to the case. \nYesterday the country’s wildlife authority said that it has suspended the hunting of lions, leopards and elephants in the Hwange area. Bow and arrow hunts can now only be approved by the head direction of the wildlife authority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T22:34:41.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
