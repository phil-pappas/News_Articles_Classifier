For the record, he opted for a more minimal look on Wednesday, sporting a “boring” suit for the occasion. Of his first drag experience, he said, “Emotionally it was amazing, but physically it was very painful. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t do anything, and I felt like Edward Scissorhands. Oh, baby, don’t mess with a drag queen.”\nIn the film by writer and director Marielle Heller, which is set in 1970s San Francisco, Skarsgard stars as the boyfriend to Kristen Wiig’s character, Charlotte, and sex partner to her precocious 15-year-old daughter, Minnie, played by up-and-comer Bel Powley.\n“Me, Alex, and Mari [Heller] would just, like, chill out in our robes on the bed in between the sex scenes, making jokes together,” Powley told Style.com. “We were totally comfortable.” As for her clothed scenes, Powley (who wore a Miu Miu frock and heels last night) said, “It was lots of high-waisted flare jeans and little stripe-y T-shirts and clogs—I loved it!” She added, “The only thing I wasn’t so keen on were those bangs. They were so thick and it took, like, a year to grow them out.” The 23-year-old Brit is already off to shoot her next film , A Storm in the Stars , with Elle Fanning.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-08-06T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:11:22.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
