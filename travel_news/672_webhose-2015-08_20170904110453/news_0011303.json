Sharing the same inspiration from grandfather Earl Woods (Tiger’s father) – who was also her first coach – she enjoyed a prolific career as an amateur, winning more than 30 tournaments, before turning professional in 2012.\nIn 2006 and 2007, she played for the Xavier College Preparatory golf team where she won back-to-back Arizona 5A State Championships and never finished lower than fifth in the state championship. In April 2011, she won the Atlantic Coast Conference and in 2012 she graduated from Wake Forest University and received a sponsor’s exemption to play in her first LPGA tournament, (Wegmans LPGA), missing the cut by four strokes.\nWoods made her professional debut at the 2012 LPGA Championship and had her first professional win on the SunCoast Ladies Series in August 2012. In 2013, Woods became a member of the Ladies European Tour and finished 78th on the Order of Merit. Her second professional win came at the Volvik RACV Ladies Masters, before earning her Category 12 tour card following her T-11 finish in December’s LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament.\nWhile she continues to make steady improvement on the golf course, the combination of good looks, an athletic figure and natural charm – no doubt aided by the family connection – has seen an explosion of interest in her off course – not least being voted one of the most beautiful women in golf by golf.com.\nTalking about life on the LPGA Tour, Woods said: “I’ve had some ups and downs in my first year but overall I’m learning a lot about my game and what it takes to be a top player. So I’m constantly trying to get better and trying to learn what I’ve got to do to get to that number one spot. I’m looking forward to the Asian Swing which will be a new experience for me.”\nAnd on her debut appearance at the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia, she added, “I’ve heard a lot of great things about the tournament so I’m looking forward to seeing it myself. We get to travel to a lot of amazing places throughout the year and I always like to get to know the places that we visit, so I’ll definitely get out to see some of the sites around KL.”\nSpeaking about her qualifying exemption for this year’s Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia, Chairman of the Sime Darby Foundation, Tun Musa Hitam added, “We’re delighted to welcome Cheyenne to the tournament for the first time. Cheyenne has shown considerable promise since turning professional in 2012 and is obviously enjoying her Rookie year on the LPGA Tour. Her positive attitude and passion for the game are very apparent and I’m sure that she will prove a big hit at this year’s tournament with Malaysian fans. We look forward to seeing her performing out on course in October.”\nTickets are now on sale for the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia 2015. Billed ‘Malaysia’s most fun golf event’, spectators can expect first-class sporting action from the world’s best female golfers on the fairways, together with four days of fun-filled entertainment off-course. The tournament features its first ever KL Food Truck Festival, celebrity DJ Patricia Knudsen, Pink Saturday, Konica Minolta Chip4Charity, and Family Zone by the pool, plus a free food voucher included with every ticket purchased, and a host of other freebies.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:13:28.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
