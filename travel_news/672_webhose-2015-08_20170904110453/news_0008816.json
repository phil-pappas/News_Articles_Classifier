Parent company Worldwide Events has also announced that it will be co-hosting PRIVATE MICE Forums alongside its flagship M&I Forums in future, giving worldwide buyers and suppliers a broader choice of event size and atmosphere. \nThe 2016 Forums will be: M&I Forum Europe Spring, Dubai, UAE – 4-9 April 2016 PRIVATE MICE Spring, Sardinia, Italy – 3-7 May 2016 M&I Forum The Americas, Scottsdale, USA – 22-26 May 2016 M&I Forum Europe Summer, Madrid, Spain – 28 June-2 July 2016 PRIVATE MICE Autumn, Amsterdam, Netherlands – 30 August-3 September 2016 M&I Forum Europe Autumn, Prague, Czech Republic – 26-30 September 2016 M&I Forum Eastern Europe, Gulf & India, Izmir, Turkey – 9-13 October 2016 M&I Forums and PRIVATE MICE Forums’ proven format of one-to-one meetings and networking activities is the leading way for event planners and MICE suppliers to connect, allowing attendees to fully experience a destination. The Operations Team at Worldwide Events employs a rigorous selection process when choosing Forum destinations, reflecting the latest global trends in MICE travel. Richard Barnes, Managing Director of Worldwide Events, said: “We are delighted with our 2016 Forums. Every year we select locations that will provide our delegates with exciting, enriching and educational Forum experiences. Our aim is to enable buyers to experience a destination exactly as their event attendees would experience it. This gives them a unique insight into the experience that their clients will receive, which we believe is invaluable.” One of the new destinations is Scottsdale, Arizona. This Wild West frontier town will host M&I Forum The Americas in May, allowing the finest buyers from all over the Americas to get intimately acquainted with this exciting destination. The event will be held at the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch, and will welcome 200 American buyers and 90 global suppliers for four days of meetings and networking activities. Another brand new destination for the Forums is Izmir, Turkey’s new MICE favourite. This ancient Aegean port has seen a huge rise in international meetings in recent years, and has welcomed some exciting new upscale hotels to its venue offering. At the M&I Forum Eastern Europe, Gulf & India in October, 150 buyers from these lucrative markets will meet with representatives from venues around the world at the Swissotel Buyuk Efes, a five-star property with a famous rooftop terrace. As well as the 3,500 pre-arranged meetings between 70 suppliers and 150 buyers, there will be networking events, dinners and sightseeing options that will introduce all attendees to this sublime destination. Next year is the first time M&I Forums will add the successful PRIVATE MICE Forums to their portfolio of events. PRIVATE MICE Forums follow the same format at M&I Forums but are strictly limited to ensure a more intimate atmosphere. At PRIVATE MICE Forums, there are no more than 70 suppliers at each event, and only independent hotels are invited – so no convention bureaus, DMCs or chains. There will be two PRIVATE MICE events in 2016, both perfect for buyers and suppliers who prefer a smaller event, giving participants the opportunity to explore the MICE attractions of Sardinia in the Spring and Amsterdam in Autumn.
