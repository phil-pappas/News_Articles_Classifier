Cinema operators have elevated the experience into an event, with fancy seats, advanced technology and other gimmicks. \nOpened in April, Quartier CineArt, a new entry to the hi-so cinema sector, may give you reason to show up early for your movie. The spacious interior is inspired by an art gallery, also showcasing futuristic flair and features. If you're an old-school moviegoer, you may find this frivolous. \nGoing to a movie like it's 2015 requires purchasing your ticket from an automatic machine, as there's no box office. You can turn your ticket into a keepsake instead of throwing it away after the credits run with the help of the Major iTicket mobile application (free on the App Store and Google Play). It allows you to have a picture of your choice or a movie poster printed on the back of your ticket, generating a QR code within the app. Use that code to print the customised ticket out at the ticket machines for an extra B39. \nThere's also a large, white counter with touchscreens on top, where you can browse through currently showing movies and watch their trailers. CineRobot can give you movie info, dance, take a picture, print it out, and more. Soon, she will be able to sell you tickets. Another futuristic babe is a hologram of a woman standing in front of the Toyota Imax, greeting moviegoers in three languages. People, the machines are coming. \nThose who crave human interaction can still buy popcorn over the refreshment counter. If all you really need are comfy seats with a place for your popcorn and soda, four regular theatres (from B200 per seat) are available. There are four special theatres, each boasting the advanced experience of movie-watching through cutting-edge technology and features. The True Screen X, for example, uses nine projectors, offering audiences a 270-degree view of the screen. Unfortunately, the wider view is as of yet compatible only with pre-movie ads and trailers. The Toyota Imax offers a super-sharp image on a premium screen, surround sound and luxurious recliners, which are claimed to be the same model used in the UN and White House. \nSince we're VIP and all, we opted for the priciest theatre, the Aeon Theatre@Quartier (B1,000 per person; B1,800 per pair). There are many pre-movie perks to enjoy -- a luxurious lounge, electric massage chairs, complimentary food set and private bathrooms. The complimentary nibbles, with one alcoholic drink, look delicious in the pictures, but are in reality a flop. We didn't expect a full seafood buffet, but subpar snacks such as flimsy French fries are just disappointing, especially for this kind of price. Moreover, you have to pay for popcorn. The seats fare better in our book, and are what you would expect from this type of theatre. \nEach unit consists of two seats, separated by a partition. You can lay on your back under a duvet while enjoying a flick from an adjustable recliner. USB slots are also available at your seat, as well as a button to call the staff, should you need assistance. The seats are positioned in such a way that allows you to enjoy the movie unobstructed, without worrying about the heads of people in front of you. The sound system is so powerful that you can feel the vibration through your seat. These features should help you lose yourself in the film. \nConsider it only when you want to make going to a movie a special occasion. A movie to cap off your date night, perhaps? G \nQuartier CineArt is on the 4/F of the Waterfall Quartier, EmQuartier. It opens daily, from 10am-9pm. Visit fb.com/quartiercineart.
