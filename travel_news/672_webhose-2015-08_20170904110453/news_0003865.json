Preparing the ideal summer excursion shouldn't be hard, particularly when there are incredible choices such as the assorted Grand Canyon air tours. The summer months are the most crowded time of year for visitors at the Grand Canyon, so remember to place your spots right away to hold your seats. Las Vegas Some of the incredible aspects regarding tours in summer is that anyone can frequently find discounted rates. An example is an air flyover trip from Glitter Gulch that is presently on sale. When you sign up for the first trip of the day, you can get this spectacular price. Something to think regarding this initial tour is that it heads right into the morning sun. That can slightly change the visibility, but in the event you're making the journey on a budget then it is your best option. The tour flies over Lake Mead and Hoover Dam enroute to the famous gorge, so it's not just one of the world's seven natural wonders that you'll observe from the air. If you can increase your funds a small amount extra, I recommend joining one of the landing tours. They include the same things that the flyovers cover, plus you'll have the choice of landing on the floor of the Canyon, at the top, or both. Down below you can select a Champagne picnic as well as take a trip on a Colorado River boat. When you rise the top, you'll see the amazing Skywalk. It provides the chance to step out to observe the Canyon below, since the Skywalk is placed on a steel and glass platform. South Rim Tusayan in Arizona is where flights depart for South Rim journeys. You'll find two types. Start with the conventional 30 minute tour and then learn about the longer 50 minute tour if you find any additional time and funds. The two tours travel to the North Rim and return to the South Rim, yet of the two the longer tour travels to the eastern border of the Grand Canyon National Park. The lengthier tour is so widespread that passengers observe about 75% of the entire National Park. If you're departing from Arizona, the South Rim tour is what I suggest. Even though you can't land inside the Canyon, you can add to your air tour with a 4x4 jeep ride. It takes you out on an thrilling adventure, displaying the Canyon and the nearby areas from another perspective. Deluxe Compared to Basic Tours - Do You Know the Differences? Travelers frequently ask me if the Deluxe tours are actually worth it. Without a doubt, yes they are! Basic tours are on Bell Ranger and AStar helicopters. These are somewhat older versatile helicopters that were modified for tourism. They yield nice viewing opportunities, yet at this time they are clearly eclipsed by additional modern choices. The deluxe tours make use of Ecostar 130 Helicopters. The chief advantages are: 1. The Ecostar is more silent, thereby providing a more restful flight. 2. Viewing is exceptional, particularly when realizing the chopper has a large 180-degree windshield. 3. Passenger arrangement is definitely better, and the cabin is designed in a way that guarantees the finest viewing from any point. One final thing to understand about the deluxe tours is that when you're flying to the West Rim then they will go directly from the Las Vegas Strip. Basic tours demand that you first go on a short shuttle ride to close by Boulder City. When considering ease and luxury, Deluxe tours are the solution. Can't Wait to Meet You at the Grand Canyon! Summer is recognized as one of the recommended times to visit the Grand Canyon. The sky is blue and visibility is superb, so if you're wanting a genuine adventure this summer, take a helicopter ride. Make reservations quickly as seats are limited, and sign up online. Booking online brings the best bargains less incurring travel agency fees. There are plenty of helicopter tours and they come with a wide assortment of options. Select one that fits your budget and you'll be certain to have a amazing time from the best position available. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon recommends these helicopter tours http://grandcanyonhelicopter.org/best-grand-canyon-helicopter-tours.html She also recommends this webpage for discounts: http://grandcanyonhelicopter.org/grand-canyon-helicopter-tour-coupons.html   09   36  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T06:09:46.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
