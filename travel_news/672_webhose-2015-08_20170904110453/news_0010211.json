We support their approach of building up a sustainable network that will encourage visitors to get off the beaten track and see more of New Zealand,” Mr Roberts says.\n“Other regions that have missed out initially will be understandably disappointed but they should keep building their cases for Jetstar to service them in future.”\nTourism 2025 identified that air connectivity and regional dispersal are both crucial to increasing the tourism industry’s contribution to New Zealand’s economy.\nThe new services will provide a strong regional distribution option for international visitors flying Qantas as well as Emirates, China Eastern, China Southern, American Airlines and their other partners, Mr Roberts says.\nAffordable regional air services also help to grow domestic tourism.\n“Competitive regional airfares and regular services encourage New Zealanders to travel around the country, to visit family and friends, attend events and for short breaks,” Mr Roberts says.\n“New Zealanders travelling within their own country contribute $37 million in economic activity every day. Offering them more good value options for flights will definitely boost that spending.”\n“Jetstar and the Qantas Group are showing a serious and long term commitment to New Zealand and our tourism industry,” Mr Roberts says.\nSource:- Tourism Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:03:14.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
