Several restoration and rehabilitation projects will also be conducted in national parks across the province including La Mauricie, Forillon and Saguenayâ€”St-Laurent Marine Park. \nThese projects are the result of an unprecedented investment by the Harper Government to support infrastructure work in our national historic sites, national parks and national marine conservation areas. This investment represents the largest federal infrastructure plan in the 104-year history of Parks Canada, ensuring these cherished places are protected and secured for the future while also creating and protecting jobs and opportunities. \nQuick Facts \nLast year, more than 21 million visits were made to Canada's national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation areas. Parks Canada is present in hundreds of communities across Canada and contributes approximately $3 billion dollars to the Canadian economy every year. Parks Canada's overall contribution to the Canadian economy is responsible for more than 40,000 jobs from coast to coast to coast. On November 24, the prime minister announced the largest infrastructure investment in Parks Canada sites across Canada in the agency's 104-year history. This investment will support infrastructure improvements to heritage, visitor experience, waterway and highway assets located within national historic sites, national parks, and national marine conservation areas across Canada. This is part of a new $5.8 billion federal infrastructure program. \nAs our country nears its 150th birthday in 2017, the Government of Canada invites Canadians to learn more about the major events that have shaped their country's history. Canada's national historic sites enable us to experience our rich history and heritage in a special way and play a big part in the celebration of Canada 150.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T02:07:37.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
