Maybe. VisitPittsurgh has its eyes on 2023, the timing of the city's potential bid for the Super Bowl. And while much of the discussion at Thursday's Fall Forecast event centered on what's ahead in the next few months, Jason Fulvi , executive vice president for VisitPittsburgh , said the group has its eyes on 2023. With the Pittsburgh Steelers submitting its application for a request to bid on the 2023 Super Bowl, the Steelers, VisitPittsburgh, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development , and the offices of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and Allegheny County Chief Executive Rich Fitzgerald are working to make sure Pittsburgh has a competitive bid. A coalition led by VisitPittsburgh has been studying a plan to establish a Pittsburgh Sports Commission. Susan McGalla , director of strategic planning and growth for the Steelers, said there's a number of things the city needs in order to land the big game. First, she said, is to believe that Pittsburgh is capable of hosting a Super Bowl. \"Pittsburgh is a destination and we have to think of it that way,\" she said. She said part of what it will take to attract the Super Bowl is the ability to envision Downtown as a Super Bowl village. It's also going to take infrastructure improvements, more parking and improved air transportation, she said. It will also take more hotel rooms, she said, noting that Pittsburgh currently meets the minimum of what is required to host a Super Bowl. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development is studying what improvements will need to be made to ensure the city has a competitive bid. On average, the 10-day period surrounding the Super Bowl has a $300 million to $500 million economic impact for the host city. \"The more events we do the more comfortable promoters are bringing large, national events to Pittsburgh,\" she said. Meanwhile, 2015 is shaping up to be a busy year for Pittsburgh. On average, conventions held in Pittsburgh equate to 240,000 hotel room nights per year. In 2015, that figure will likely surpass 300,000, according to Karl Pietrzak , vice president of convention sales for VisitPittsburgh. Here's a look at some of the events happening this fall: Connect Marketplace & Connect SPORTS Marketplace conference will be held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center Aug. 27-29. The event, which is expected to draw 1,750 attendees, is an annual sports tourism conference. The USS LST 325 will dock in Pittsburgh Sept. 1 with the World War II ship open for tours Sept. 2 through Sept. 8. The first Landing Ship Tank, which was designed in 1942 to land battle-ready tanks and supplies, was manufactured on Neville Island. The ship, which will be open for tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., will be docked on the North Shore near Heinz Field. The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership will host its final Rooftop Shindig Sept. 9. The event, which will be the third of its kind held this summer, features free live music and a movie screening on the roof the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust parking garage. The Sept. 9 event will feature music by Balloon Ride Fantasy and a screening of Zoolander. Leigh White, vice president of marketing and communications for the PDP said each of the previous events drew about 2,000 attendees. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust will present India in Focus Sept. 25 through Dec. 31. The six-week event brings a selection of art and other culture from the Republic of India, including visual art, dance, music and theatre. In October, the Westmoreland Museum of American Art will host its grand reopening. The museum, which is located in Greensburg has been undergoing an expansive renovation, which includes construction of a new 15,000-square-foot east wing. A free community day will be hosted Oct. 25. The General Grand Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star will host its Triennial Assembly at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center Oct. 30 through Nov. 6. The event, which has been in the works for 10 years, according to Pietrzak, is expected to draw 7,000 attendees. Pittsburgh's annual Light Up Night will be held Nov. 20. White said the PDP is working to bring another national act to play on the Clemente Bridge following the success of last year's performance by Cobra Starship. The event also marks the opening of the Peoples Gas Holiday Market in Market Square which will remain open through Dec. 23. Looking ahead to 2106, a number of conventions and sporting events are slated to happen in Pittsburgh, including: The National League of Cities' 2016 Congress of Cities and Exposition will be held in November, drawing 5,000 attendees. The Association for Iron and Steel Technology will hold is annual conference in May, drawing 7,000 attendees.
