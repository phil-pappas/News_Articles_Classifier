Step back in time \nAn hour from Wellington, Greytown was NZ's first inland settlement, dating back to 1854. The main street is lined with beautifully restored heritage buildings, from Wyett House, a former finishing school for girls (now a luxurious bed and breakfast) at 12 Main St, to the former saddlery at number 174. \n2. Get the taste buds tingling \nSchoc Chocolate is an artisan chocolate \"studio\" which produces 85 flavours on site. Expand your horizons with tastings of strawberry-pepper, lime-chilli or caramel-tequila chocolate. Traditionalists are also well catered for. schoc.co.nz \n3. Settle in \nAllow plenty of time to explore Cobblestones Early Settlers Museum – there's an entire village of historic buildings to explore, along with displays from the museum's extensive collection. cobblestonesmuseum.org.nz \n4. Sip and swallow \nTry Wairarapa pinot noir and plenty more besides at Martinborough Wine Merchants (martinboroughwinemerchants.com), or sample the wines at Poppies over a seasonal lunch platter among the vines (poppiesmartinborough.co.nz) \n5. Venture out \nGreytown is an ideal base for visiting Aratoi art and history museum in Masterton (aratoi.org.nz), Pukaha Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre near Masterton (pukaha.org.nz), and Tui Brewery, Mangatainoka (tuibrewery.co.nz) - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T00:25:28.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
