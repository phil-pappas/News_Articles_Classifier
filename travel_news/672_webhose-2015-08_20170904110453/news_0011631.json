Zoo officials say the older bear has a long history of nuisance behaviour at Grand Teton, where she had raided backpacks and campsites for food for several years.\nThe bears have been placed in quarantine and will join an exhibit in about a month. The exhibit already includes a 16-year-old male black bear.\nZoo President and CEO Elizabeth Whealy says the facility is proud to be able to provide the bears \"a new lease on life.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:13:02.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
