Where others ask will it be too hot during the day, will it be too cold at night, are the natives friendly, I just ask what time the plane is leaving.\nI love the tawny colours and shifting scenery and that, while our tiny island is overcrowded, the desert is, well, deserted.\nIf you are a kite-surfer, you will already know Dakhla, where Morocco meets the Sahara.\nSandstone under a blazing sun: The village of Budkhula sums up the stark setting of the Dakhla oasis\nIt is just over two hours by plane from Casablanca.\nIt's set on a long finger of sand that juts out from the mainland, creating a shallow lagoon on the one side while the Atlantic strafes the other. Its year-round sunny climate and cooling winds make it one of the world's best sporting destinations.\nKitesurfing, quad biking, paragliding, camel trekking, the desert sands colourfully dubbed the Pensinsula of the Golden River by early Spanish settlers are perfect for bracing outdoor activities. If you go to the Canaries, you will already have strolled on Dakhla sands — the Moroccans export it to enhance the lava beaches of the islands some 300 miles to the north.\nDakhla proper is magical.\nI checked into a room in the Bab Al Bahar hotel, which has its feet right in the water of the lagoon, and five minutes later I was clambering over the rocks into the little boat belonging to Nicolas, the Frenchman who runs the hotel, and chugging out towards the setting sun to spot dolphins.\n Next Wish 'roo were here!

Picked right out of the oyster farm under your nose, immediately opened up and sprinkled with lemon, they could not be any fresher.\nThe whole point of Dakhla is its striking geography, but for those who are curious about the town and the port, one of the most important in Morocco, both are well worth a visit. The local Saharwi (people of the Sahara) in their colourful tribal robes are so unused to tourists, they don't expect to bargain or even sell.\nIt will be a long time until Dakhla is a household word like Marrakech, even among fans of Morocco. But for those who like getting away from it all and enjoying places ahead of the crowds, this is the time and the place.\nI remember when Estepona, on the overcrowded Spanish Costa del Sol, boasted no more than a lone fishing boat, a workman's cafe and not one high rise - and was no worse for its simplicity.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own escape to Morocco Royal Air Maroc (020 730 758 00, www.royalairmaroc.com ) flies from London to Dakhla from £350 return.\nDouble rooms at Bab Al Bahar hotel (020 3564 4407, www.babalbaharhotelandspadakhla.com ) cost from £68 B&B, and doubles at the Attitude Hotel (00212 661 835 010, www.dakhla-attitude.ma ) start at£100, full board.\nMore information on Morocco at www.visitmorocco.com .\nRead more: Dakhla Attitude Hotel Voyage au Maroc - Vacances, tourisme, séjour - Office National Marocain du Tourisme", "external_links": ["http://www.royalairmaroc.com/", "http://www.dakhla-attitude.ma/", "http://www.visitmorocco.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1EecuuZ"], "published": "2015-08-25T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T02:05:06.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
