Mother Nature's white stuff is as fickle as a 40-year-old ski bum mid season. You just can't rely on them showing up. \nBut there are some factors that can help keep the odds in your favour when choosing a ski resort for a snow holiday. Average snow depth over the years used to be one of them but we've all seen how erratic the snow can be from one year to the next regardless of how deep it was 10 years ago. \nSnowmaking has certainly improved many a holidaymaker's chances and if you really want a 100 per cent guarantee then you can just head to Ski Dubai for the world's longest indoor ski slope (400 metres) on man-made snow, or you could wait till 2020 when Dubai opens the chairlift on a 1.2km man-made indoor snow slope. In the meantime, try any of these on for size and tell them we sent you. Killington, Vermont, US The US East Coast resort lays claim to the world's most extensive snowmaking system. The resort already receives an average of 250 inches of natural snow each winter but to top that up, their snowmaking covers 600 skiable acres. Alyeska, Alaska, US What if we told you that in 2011 Alyeska received 24 metres of snow in their ski season? What if we said that the following season they received 18 metres and that in the not so great last two seasons they received 12 metres? Even in a bad season, Alyeska has a good season. DENIS BALIBOUSE \nBeginner skiers make the most of the great snow at Zermatt. \nZermatt, Switzerland \nA long season from late November to the end of April, a high altitude, a glacier and extensive snow making ensure that Zermatt will always deliver. Add 350 kilometres of piste and a thriving resort village. What's not to love? \nMt Baker, Washington State, US \nMt Baker has a reputation, a big reputation. Powder lovers talk about the infamous season of 1998/99 when over 29 metres of snow fell upon this humble ski resort. Even now the average snowfall is 16 metres a season. The resort has 8 chairlifts and 1000 skiable acres suited more to intermediate and advanced skiers and isn't the easiest mountain to get to. But imagine the boasting rights when you do. \nHokkaido and Honshu, Japan \nIt is hard to get official statistics on which resort in Japan honestly receives the most snow. There are anything from 500 to 700 ski resorts to choose from depending on who you talk to. \nThose in Hokkaido will say they get 17 metres plus, those in Honshu say the same or just a little less but they all agree it is the lightest and driest snow found on the globe. We must ask Utah about that. Ad Feedback \nBe warned - with all this snow, the sky is often more grey than blue and the light can be flat, so just dive right in and hang on for dear life when the white room gets you. Our pick? Head straight to Rusutsu for deep powder and ski-in ski-out amusement parks with singing trees. \nMount Washington, Vancouver Island, Canada \nYou won't find many Australian or Kiwi accents here but you will find stunning mountain coastal views and 11.5 metres of snowfall a season. Yes, a season. The resort caters well for intermediates and advanced skiers, has 505 metres of vertical, 5 lifts and 81 runs. \nGrand Targhee, Wyoming, US \nOver the range from the ski mecca of Jackson Hole you will find the cult resort of Grand Targhee. The rustic home town ski resort offers resort style skiing and boarding as well as cat skiing with lunch in a yurt. But best of all, it also offers 12 metres of snow per season with 3000 acres on which to ski it. If you're staying at Jackson Hole, you can get a day pass plus return bus trip for around US$100 to go to 'Targhee' for the day. \nHeli Skiing in Canada \nIf you have access to a helicopter and a few thousand dollars in your pocket then chances are you'll get to ski as much snow as you desire in interior British Columbia with a handful of heli ski operations including the original Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T20:03:34.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
