The Care2 petition has gathered more than 117,000 signatures.\nKalahari Resorts, a water park resort chain, has locations in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Sandusky, Ohio, and Poconos Mountains, Pennsylvania. Its Wisconsin and Ohio locations host tiger and lion cubs as a tourist attraction.\nThe Care2 petition points to a video that shows a handler hitting a tiger cub in the face to force it to pose with tourists. The petition asks Kalahari to stop exploiting exotic animal cubs and to end its relationships with Timbavati Wildlife Park and Wild Acres Ranch, which are privately-owned breeding facilities that provide the animals.\n“It’s so disgusting to see photo displays like the one at Kalahari treating these endangered animals like disposable toys and feeding a vicious cycle of breeding, exploitation, and discarding of cubs,” Mary Elizabeth told Care2. “It’s time for Kalahari to step up to the plate, give endangered animals the respect and care they deserve, and stop supporting these irresponsible and inhumane exhibits.”\nMary Elizabeth says former photo-prop cubs often face a dismal fate, and end up languishing in roadside zoos or as private pets, smuggled overseas illegally, or slaughtered for their parts.\nWilliam Coburn is the owner of Wild Acres Ranch, which supplies cubs to Kalahari’s Sandusky, Ohio location. According to the Humane Society of the United States, he has been cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for various violations of the Animal Welfare Act. He also has lions and bears slaughtered to sell their meat.\nUnder Ohio state law, it’s illegal to privately breed or own exotic animals, including big cats. But because Coburn is a member of the Zoological Association of America (ZAA), he is exempt from Ohio’s animal laws.\n“This unfortunately means that the burden is on Kalahari to ensure that they aren’t supporting animal abuse,” Mary Elizabeth says.\nTimbavati Wildlife Park, which provides tiger cubs for Kalahari’s Wisconsin Dells location, has been cited by both state and federal authorities for illegal animal trafficking.\nIn 1986, Timbavati owner Mark Schoebel plead guilty to four counts of wildlife infractions after a federal investigation revealed he had provided bears for slaughter and sale to Korea, where the parts are used in traditional medicine. In 2002, a federal sting operation called “Operation Snow Plow” revealed nearly a dozen of Schoebel’s former photo cubs were sold to an animal slaughter ring, shot in trailers, and skinned.\nKalahari is currently offering Wisconsin Dells resort guests free passes to Schoebel’s park, a relationship the Care2 petition insists must end.\nDespite the public outcry, Mary Elizabeth says she’s had no response from Kalahari.\n“Since I’ve started my petition to Kalahari, I’ve emailed the executives three times, submitted complaints through the customer service section of both location’s websites, and brought up the issue on their Facebook page multiple times, with no response,” she says. “Kalahari’s failure to respond to the legitimate concerns of over 100,000 people is very disheartening. No responsible company should knowingly support the abuse, exploitation, and crime inherent in cub photo exhibits.”", "external_links": ["http://www.thepetitionsite.com/261/178/419/"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:13:38.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
