You should plan well in advance if you're planning to travel during high season, especially if your trip coincides with Christmas and New Years , Spring Break , or school vacation weeks. \nLow season runs from mid-April to mid-December, and partially overlaps with hurricane season in the Caribbean. Some resorts cut their off-season rates by 50 percent or more to attract visitors and fill empty rooms, and destination-wide deals and promotions involving discounts on lodging, food, attractions, and even airfare are not unusual at this time of year. \nMost travelers are surprised to learn that the Caribbean off-season extends right into winter in the Northern Hemisphere and, indeed, mid-October to mid-December is an ideal time to travel to the warm tropics and save money, since the threat of hurricanes has largely diminished at this point.
