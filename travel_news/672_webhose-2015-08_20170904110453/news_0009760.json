These are the latest unlikely visitors holidaying in war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo.\nEastern DR Congo has been mired for decades in rebel battles, but such sights are helping bring tourists back to Virunga National Park, which reopened last year.\nSurrounding misty forests in green hills of the vast park – stretching for 7,800sq km – are home to a quarter of the world’s critically endangered mountain gorillas. The tourists are vital: the income they bring funds the park’s survival.\nNyiragongo, a 3470m peak and a steep and stiff five-hour hike from lush rain forests, is part of a chain of volcanoes in one of the world’s most active regions.\nThe tourist industry in the region – needed to keep the Unesco world heritage site running and its animal inhabitants safe – collapsed in 2012. Militia forces remain active, and Virunga’s chief warden Emmanuel de Merode was himself wounded by gunmen by 2014.\nTourism revenue is “vital” to the future of Virunga, helping to benefit some 4mn people in and around the vast park, as well as “peace and prosperity” in general, Merode said. It gives people an alternative income other than cutting down the forests for charcoal, and a motivation to protect the park.\nIn 2011, over 3,000 visitors came to Virunga, but violence forced the park to shut the next year, and it only fully reopened in late 2014.\nBut tourist numbers have bounced back, with almost 3,000 visiting already so far this year, bringing in much needed revenues to pay rangers. A total of 16 tourists can hike up the mountain a day – on a recent trip in torrential rain and hailstorms up the peak, a dozen tourists took part, including Americans, Belgians, British and Israelis.\nThe last major eruption in 2002 saw fast flowing lava devastate the Goma, covering the city of around a million in a river of molten rock flowing as fast as 100km per hour.\nOscar-nominated 2014 documentary Virunga-which showed the efforts to protect Africa’s oldest national park from war, poachers and oil companies-has also brought back tourists.\n“With each person coming to visit Virunga, there is a little bit more hope that things will get better,” said Mlanie Gouby, a French investigative journalist, whose work to expose oil company expansion into the park is a key part of the film.\n“It’s wonderful that so many tourists have come back in such a short time after the end of the conflict – to hear that the documentary is part of the reason why they are coming to Virunga is both incredibly exciting and humbling,” Gouby added.\nAs night falls and temperatures drop below freezing, the warmth from the molten lava warms the hands of the tourists, dangling their legs over the sheer drop into the crater, watching plate tectonics in action giving hopes to Virunga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:08:56.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
