He sent the intelligence to Yan'an through classified channels on 6 June. Mao Zedong ordered a message to be sent to the Communist International and the information finally reached the Soviet leader Stalin. Thanks to the accuracy of the information, the Soviet Union made battle preparations and its Communist Party expressed gratitude to its Chinese counterpart on 30 June. The Soviet Union thought highly of Yan's work. A Soviet official stationed in China once said to Yan that his intelligence work was of the highest level and that Stalin knew about him. The life of Yan (1895-1968) is a legend and his stories are still held up as examples of information warfare today. Yan made a great contribution to the Allied victory in the Second World War... Yan joined the Chinese Communist Party secretly in 1937 and came to Chongqing where the Kuomintang government was in October 1938. He had contacts with many high-level Kuomintang officials. He was entrusted by Zhou Enlai to do international intelligence work for the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist International. Days before the sneak Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the intelligence service of the Kuomintang deciphered the information about it. Yan learned about the plans and reported to Chinese Communist Party. The information was sent to the Soviet Union, which informed the US. Meanwhile, the US Navy received the same information from the Kuomintang. Unfortunately, the US Navy underestimated the value of the information and did not prepare for the attack. During the summer of 1944, Yan gathered information about the Japanese Kwantung army that was stationed in north-east China, including its defence plans, locations of fortresses and weapon information. Yan made a great contribution to the Allied victory in the Second World War. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary, President Yeltsin of Russia awarded the Jubilee Medal to Yan and two of his comrades.
