The sessions which are well attended by over 50 people from various departments typically cover useful vocabulary and important phrases that are frequently used in their line of work. “We believe that the caliber of service, attention to detail and consistent quality delivered to our guests lie in the hands of our team members.” Mr. Vitanart Vathanakul, Executive Director of the Royal Cliff Hotels Group said. “In addition to offering fundamental tourism and hospitality training, here at the Royal Cliff, we also try to help develop our staffs’ international language skills. Not only will these courses assist our team members in excelling in their profession, but it will also benefit them in the future as they will be more competitive once Thailand enters the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC).” Situated on a 64 acre private parkland estate overlooking the stunning Gulf of Thailand, the Royal Cliff Hotels Group has been honored with multiple awards and recognition from organizations of national and international repute. It is home to four award winning 5-star hotels offering a sensory experience defined profoundly by its style, culture and elegance - all presented with the distinctive spirit of the State of Exclusivity and Fascination.
