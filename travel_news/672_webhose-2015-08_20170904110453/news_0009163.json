This could be very detrimental in forms of higher prices and less availability.”\nShane Downey, director of public policy at GBTA, believes Lufthansa will not be the only airline to look at changing its distribution model.\n\"The [DCC] charge is a cost increase with no benefit and rolled out so quickly that buyers can't adjust their budgets that have been set up for the year. If this is successful other airlines will follow like they did with ancillary and baggage fees.”\nCharlie Leocha, president of travel law firm Travelers United, also bemoaned the lack of competition in the industry.\n“Lufthansa would never be able to do this if they were 30 airlines crossing the Atlantic, but now there are only three major transatlantic carriers and they are in alliances and joint ventures,” said Leocha.\n“If Lufthansa moves this forward on its own it could affect their partners in the airline alliance [Star Alliance]. But it can only happen when there is no real competition, the industry has consolidated a step too far.”\nDowney added: “There are disruptors in the industry that provide benefits, but this helps no one except the airline. This could affect Lufthansa's business and if technology is rolled out too soon it poisons the well.”\nClick on the GDS tag below to read more on the Lufthansa GDS charge", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-29T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T00:28:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
