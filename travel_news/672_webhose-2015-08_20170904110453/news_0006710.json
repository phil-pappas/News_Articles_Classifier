Cultural experiences South Africa invests R100m in tourism 18 August 2015 Speaking at the launch of Tourism Month in Limpopo on 16 August, Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom said R100-million had been invested in growing the tourism sector in the country. \"With this investment we are committed to ensuring that the wonders we boast of, and the unique heritage we have been endowed with, are shared by more and more South Africans,\" he said. Everyone can be an ambassador Hanekom said it was important that all South Africans became ambassadors of their own country. They could start by travelling within the country to discover, learn, and fall in love with all its beauty and diversity. \"As more of our people discover more about our country, they will feel a sense of pride and belonging. \"There is nothing like direct contact and interaction between people to break through artificial social barriers and allow us to share the things we all have in common,\" he said. Employment and growth In 2014, tourism accounted for close to 10% of all employed people in South Africa. Domestic trips increased by 11% in the year to reach 28 million, and the revenue generated by domestic tourism alone in 2014 was R26.8-billion. It's all about access Hanekom said for the country to reach its target of 18 million domestic tourists by 2020  as set out in the National Tourism Sector Strategy  it would have to work harder to make tourism more affordable and more accessible to all South Africans. \"We are therefore very keen to work with the trade to make travel a reality for millions of South Africans,\" he said. \"All members of the trade are encouraged to upload their value-for-money deals on to the Sho't Left website and to provide a variety of packages and options to suit all budgets.\" World Tourism Day This year, World Tourism Day falls on 27 September, and the theme is \"A billion tourists, a billion opportunities\". It provides a platform to examine how communities around the world work to grow tourism through unearthing new opportunities. World Tourism Day in South Africa will be celebrated in Limpopo. The province is home to world-class travel attractions such as the Mapungubwe World Heritage Site and the Kruger National Park.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T13:22:08.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
