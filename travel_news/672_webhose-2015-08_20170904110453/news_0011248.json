AEGEAN, launches the student program “Supporting the Youth”, following the initiative already implemented in Greece since 2014.\nThe specific program aims to relieve family budgets and support Cypriot students studying in Greek Universities.\nIn particular, the program targets all 2015 – 2016 freshmen Cypriot students, admitted in Greek Universities.\nAEGEAN is committed to provide more than 1,600 tickets to 50 Cypriot students studying in Greece, ensuring their free transportation from their residence in Cyprus, to their city University in Greece and vice versa. The Cypriot students will receive 8 free tickets per year, for the total duration of their four or five year studies.\nIt is noted that the evaluation of the applications is based mainly on socio-economic criteria, but also on the grade of admission at the University.\nAEGEAN’s goal is to give young Cypriots that study in Greece, the opportunity to travel more often, in order to be close to their loved ones.\nSource: AEGEAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T06:15:53.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
