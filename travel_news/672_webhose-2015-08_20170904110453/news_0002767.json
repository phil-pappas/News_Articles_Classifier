Not only are tourist snapshots some of the most inexpensive souvenirs an excursionist can bring home, they can also help you earn a little cash on the side. Interested in making money from your vacation pictures? These tips from professional travel photographers will give you some inside knowledge.\nAudience: Everything-everywhere.com's Gary Arndt has been posting his travel photography online for nearly a decade, gaining both national and international attention for his efforts. His method for earning that elusive six-figure income might surprise you, however. According to Arndt, his secret lies with not worrying about selling his images and focusing instead on selling to the extensive audience he has developed with those images over the years. An audience that exists for both his blog and his social media platforms, including Instagram.\nHis recommended products? Things like online training courses, electronic books and gear items from companies he trusts. Arndt also leads paid photo tours through partnerships with adventure companies. While other photography professionals have found success with online image sales, that isn't where the bulk of his revenue comes from. \"Online photo sales for me are really only about $200 to $300 per year,\" says Arndt.\nConcept: According to Karen Foley, a photographer who earns a living from the stock image site Dreamstime, paying attention to certain types of photo opportunities can pay off big time when it comes to image sales. \"Iconic images associated with popular travel destinations have been done to death,\" says Foley. The photographer adds, \"It's better to look off the beaten path. Destinations that are by definition difficult to reach will not already be completely covered.\" Foley also advises searching out photo opportunities of people enjoying destinations which fit into current travel trends, such as family-friendly destinations, the 50-plus retiree or adventure travel.\nMinnesota photographer Amy Zellmer prefers to keep things a little more personal by focusing on the needs and wants of her customer base. For example, when she prints out larger images to sell at the Saint Paul Art Crawl, she also makes sure to print smaller, more affordable items as well. Things such as small framed prints, magnets and even greeting cards help provide a price range that meets the needs of all. Zellmer also sells her images on Etsy, where she incorporates key words into the descriptions that match what people are already searching for. When asked what people tend to purchase, the art pro states that is also a personal decision for her customers. \"If something resonates with them such as a palm tree or a type of flower, they will purchase it,\" says Zellmer.\n—__\n(Myscha Theriault is a best-selling author and avid traveler.
