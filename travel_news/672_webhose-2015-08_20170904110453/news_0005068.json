This was reported by China News, a state-owned media outlet based in Beijing.\nNumber of Chinese tourists who visit Paris has grown by 52%, confirms a representative from a tourism association in Paris.\nTianjin-based biotechnology, logistics and finance conglomerate Tiens sent 6,400 employees to France on a four-day trip by company founder and chair, Li Jinyuan.\nThe group booked 140 hotels in Paris, 7,600 train tickets, and 4,760 rooms in four and five star hotels in Monaco and Cannes. This is the largest ever Chinese tour group to visit France and, in all, the employees spent around €13 million (US$15 million) in Paris; while Nice is said to have made €20 million (US$22 million) from the tour group.\nThe 17% depreciation of the euro over the past year means that traveling to Europe is cheaper than ever before for Chinese people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T08:27:37.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
