Seychelles was one of the countries who appealed to the AU (Africa Union) to work with its member states to develop a Brand Africa for the continent’s tourism industry. The AU followed this appeal by organising a Ministerial Meeting on this very point in Seychelles over a year ago now.\nThis Ghana meeting will be uniting a large number of Tourism Ministers from Africa and through the UNWTO, they will all be seated together to analyse this call for a Brand Africa bearing in mind that tourism is one of the Africa’s most promising sectors in terms of development.\nSource:- Tourism Seychelles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:08:51.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
