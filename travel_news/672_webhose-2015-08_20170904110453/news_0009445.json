This is absolutely untrue.\nWe value the key role of our current and former military personnel and have several initiatives in place to support the Armed Forces community. This includes offering free travel to serving military personnel and veterans at different times of the year, supporting reservists and helping personnel who are transitioning from military life into full time work.\nOur summer promotion was launched on 13 July and has been running on Saturdays and some Sundays during July and August. It is designed to encourage people to take a day trip to one of the many destinations on our network. Our trains are generally quieter than normal at weekends which means we normally have space on our trains to offer special promotional tickets. However, we are also conscious that there can be times when our network is very busy, even at weekends, due to sporting and other special events. On those days, we do not want a situation where a promotion results in serious overcrowding and a bad experience for customers.\nPrior to the launch of this offer, we looked at the various events taking place across our network throughout the summer and took the decision to exclude a number of days from the promotional offer. For example, due to the large number of people travelling on our trains for the RideLondon major cycling event on 1 August, the promotional tickets were not available on that day. The days excluded from the promotional offer were clearly communicated on our website at the time of the launch.\nOn Saturday 15 August, there were four major events taking place on our network including Red Bull Air Race at Ascot and the England vs France rugby match at Twickenham, where a crowd of 65,000 fans were expected. Our proven experience of previous major events such as this is that it would not have been responsible to encourage more people onto our trains through a promotional offer when we knew they would already be very busy with people travelling to the rugby and the other events.\nOur summer promotional campaigns have always proved very popular and offer a good value day out. We want people to get the best experience of their journey with us and that is why we have taken the decision to offer these tickets when we know there is space available on our trains.\nWe are disappointed this has been misinterpreted by some media organisations. We will continue to support the Armed Forces community directly through our business and in and partnership with other organisations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:33:11.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
