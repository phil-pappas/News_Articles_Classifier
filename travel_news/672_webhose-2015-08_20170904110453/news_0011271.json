The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said a woman in her 40s suffered life-threatening injuries when a tree fell on her while she was walking with her daughter in Surrey. \nThe bulk of the power outages occurred in the Greater Vancouver Area, and BC Hydro said that as of 10 a.m. Sunday about 180,000 customers were still waiting for power to be restored.
