That’s when Hinds ratcheted up her mother’s sternness.\nMost Read Stories “I had to say, ‘No! You can’t go back for your purse or your shoes! Put your cigarette out! The building could blow up!’ ”\nHinds was hailed as a hero by Bremerton police and fire officials who said her fast action likely averted a greater tragedy when the explosion ripped through the newly remodeled motel around 8:30 p.m.\nPolice and fire officials said none of the 65 guests is believed to have been injured in the explosion that destroyed 16 rooms and was reportedly felt as far away as Poulsbo and Port Orchard. In large part, they said, this was due to Hinds sounding an alarm and pounding on doors.\n“You have to contemplate how much worse it could have been,” said Bremerton Police Chief Steve Strachan.\nOfficials initially feared up to five guests were unaccounted for, but after a day of searching with cadaver dogs and an excavator, Fire Chief Al Duke said he was “99.9 percent certain” there were no bodies in the rubble.\nCascade Natural Gas employee Larry Jennings, who responded to the motel after the report of a gas leak, was critically injured. He was working to cut off the gas when the explosion occurred.\nJennings, 59, a Bremerton resident and a Cascade employee since 1982, was flown to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle with second- and third-degree burns and extensive injuries, according to Cascade Natural Gas.\nTwo Bremerton firefighters also sustained minor injuries when the force of the blast rocketed them 20 feet through the air, police said.\nHinds says she was in the motel office about 8 p.m. when a passer-by walked in and reported a gas line was leaking at the rear of the building. She went outside and saw “a lot of gas” was escaping from the line.\nShe called 911, and Cascade Natural Gas was alerted.\n“I pulled the alarm and started corralling people away from the building,” Hinds said. “I wanted to make sure all my guests were out.”\nAround 8:30 p.m., a section of the motel exploded into flames, shooting plumes of thick, black smoke into the sky. Motel security cameras captured the blast.\nDuke, the fire chief, said the gas leak and explosion appear to have been accidental, but police detectives and federal investigators will be working to determine the cause.\nInvestigators are focusing on a gas meter that may have been damaged just before the blast.\nPolice spent Tuesday night and much of Wednesday chasing down rumors about the cause, including reports that someone drove a car into the gas meter or that it was somehow related to a domestic-violence incident.\nStrachan, the police chief, said officers had been called to the hotel for a reported domestic-violence incident shortly before 8 p.m. Tuesday. Another police officer said the dispute may have involved parents and their daughter, who left the motel by climbing out of a window, the officer said.\nCasey Doland was visiting a relative in a house across the street from the rear of the motel when she and her cousin’s husband saw someone hanging from an air conditioner and then watched the person drop to the ground. Doland said the person appeared to land on, and break, the gas meter.\nPolice Capt. Tom Wolfe said the daughter was interviewed and she claimed she did not break the meter. Duke said the motel’s surveillance cameras were not positioned to view it.\nEven after she helped evacuate guests from her motel, Hinds was still not finished.\nAs displaced guests watched firefighters battle the blaze, she was busy working the phones.\nShe called every hotel and motel in the city and many in the county looking for empty rooms. She said she tried to find someone to bring food and water and summoned cabs for those who needed a ride.\n“I’m really worried about them,” she said tearfully. “Some of them lost everything.”\nShe said the impact of what had happened didn’t hit home until she woke up Wednesday and thought about the children that had been staying at the motel. She estimated that about one-third of her guests were under 12.\n“It just hit me when I thought about all their little faces and how all of the babies could have been killed,” she said.\nHinds downplays the hero talk. She says she was just doing her job.\nGuest Keith Dalton, of Vancouver, B.C., disagreed.\n“I think she was doing more than her job,” he said. “She’s pretty impressive.”\nChristine Clarridge can be reached at cclarridge@seattletimes.com or 206-464-8983.
