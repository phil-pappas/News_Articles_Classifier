The first event, to be held in Liberia on 2 and 3 September, will bring together community members and leaders, volunteers, NGOs, government representatives and the Liberia National Red Cross Society to collectively examine their local needs and discuss community-driven solutions. \n“The fight against Ebola in Liberia was fought at the grassroot level, starting with the communities themselves,” said Fayiah Tamba, Secretary General of the Liberia National Red Cross Society. “Empowering communities is crucial to deliver sustainable humanitarian action. We are pleased to host the first humanitarian hub event for Voices to Action.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:35:29.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
