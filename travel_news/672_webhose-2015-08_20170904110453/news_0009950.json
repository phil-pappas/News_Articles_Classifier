For tourists, an hour with a gorilla family costs US$400, while a night on the volcano costs US$250. \nTourism revenue is “vital” to the future of Virunga, helping to benefit some four million people in and around the vast park, as well as “peace and prosperity” in general, Merode told AFP. \nIt gives people an alternative income than cutting down the forests for charcoal, and a motivation to protect the park. \n“Every tourist that visits Virunga is contributing,” Merode said. \nIn 2011, over 3,000 visitors came to Virunga, but violence forced the park shut the next year, and only fully reopening in late 2014. \nBut tourist numbers have bounced back, with almost 3,000 visiting already so far this year, bringing in much needed revenues to pay rangers. \nA total of 16 tourists can hike up the mountain a day — on a recent trip in torrential rain and hail storms up the peak made by AFP, a dozen tourists took part, with nationalities including Americans, Belgians, British and Israelis. \nThe last major eruption in 2002 saw fast flowing lava devastate the Goma, covering the city of around a million in a river of molten rock flowing as fast as 100km per hour. \nOscar-nominated 2014 documentary “Virunga” — which showed the efforts to protect Africa’s oldest national park from war, poachers and oil companies — has also brought back tourists. \nA photo taken on August 1, 2015 shows mountain gorillas in the jungle at Bukima in Virunga National Park, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. — AFP pic ‘I saw how the Earth was born’ \n“We saw the film, and said, we have to see that,” said Jacques, a Belgian businessman working in Congo, after trekking into the steamy jungles to see the gorillas, the symbol of the park. \nRangers communicate with the gorillas, exchanging heavy grunts to reassure the groups, including the massive male “silverback” weighing an estimated 160 kilos. \n“With each person coming to visit Virunga, there is a little bit more hope that things will get better,” said Mélanie Gouby, a French investigative journalist, whose work to expose oil company expansion into the park is a key part of the film. \n“It’s wonderful that so many tourists have come back in such a short time after the end of the conflict — to hear that the documentary is part of the reason why they are coming to Virunga is both incredibly exciting and humbling,” Gouby added. \nAs night falls and temperatures drop below freezing, the warmth from the molten lava warms the hands of the tourists, dangling their legs over the sheer drop into the crater, watching plate tectonics in action. \n“I saw how the Earth was born,” one entry from an American couple read in the park’s visitor’s book. “How often can you climb a mountain and come back with an understanding of how we are all here?” — AFP  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:54:17.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
