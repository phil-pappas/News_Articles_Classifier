The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 1.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,988.87. The Nasdaq composite added 15.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,828.32.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time U.S. stocks went into their swoon last week, mostly over signs of a slowdown in China, the world’s second-biggest economy. Before the six-day losing streak had ended, the Dow had plummeted 1,900 points and the S&P 500 was undergoing its first “correction,” a decline of 10 percent or more, in nearly four years.\nBut stocks soared at midweek, cutting the Dow’s losses nearly in half, in a rally analysts attributed to bargain-hunting, signs that the Federal Reserve may hold off raising interest rates this fall, and a new report that said the U.S. economy is growing at a more robust rate than previously believed.\nStill, the concerns that triggered the sell-off remain: slumping oil prices, a slowing Chinese economy, weak corporate earnings forecasts and uncertainty over interest rates.\nThat means there’s likely to be more market volatility ahead, something that history backs up. September has been the worst month for stocks.\n“For the last few years, let’s face it, there’s been very little volatility,” said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief strategist. “We’ve had a very impressive rally. Not that we can’t go higher, but it’s not going to be an easy path to get there.”\nThe S&P 500 is still nearly three times higher than its post-2008 financial crisis low in March 2009. The Dow is up roughly 2 1/2 times higher.\nDespite the bounce-back this week, stocks are on course for their worst monthly performance in more than three years. The S&P 500 is down 5.5 percent in August, and the Dow is down 5.9 percent.\n“That kind of volatility is pretty scary,” said Hans Chang, 33, who was visiting New York on Friday. Because he recently left his job, Chang has to sell investments he bought with stock options within 90 days — something he can’t do now without taking a big loss.\nBut for other investors like James Day, a data management specialist in Ferndale, Michigan, the stock market swoon was a signal to buy low and boost his contributions to his 401(k).\n“I’m not looking to retire tomorrow, so as far as I’m concerned, I have time,” said Day, 43. “If I don’t think I’m staring down the barrel of some long-term recession or unemployment, I look at these dips as an opportunity.”\nInvestors can expect the volatility to continue at least until the market gets a better idea from the Fed on the timing of an interest rate increase, something many investors fear could put a damper on the U.S. economy.\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Friday that before the recent turbulence, there was a “pretty strong case” for raising rates in September. But he said the Fed is watching how events unfold.\nTraders and strategists have often described the U.S. stock market as overbought. Even with the wild swings this week, investors are paying close to $18 for every $1 of earnings in the S&P 500 — above the $15 investors have historically paid for stocks after World War II.\n“It’s still an expensive market,” said Kevin Dorwin, managing principal of San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough. “We still need to see earnings growth or valuations improve, and absent that, it’s hard to see how the market can move up.”\nRob Lee, 64, of Melbourne, Australia, said he invests only small amounts of money in “very safe securities” because he wants to avoid the risk of sharp drops in the market like the one last week. But he added: “It’ll bounce back. It always does.”\n___\nAP Business Writers Steve Rothwell, Ken Sweet and Marley Jay in New York contributed to this report.\nALEX VEIGA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:41:52.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
