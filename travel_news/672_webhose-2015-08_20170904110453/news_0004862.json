This information is from MAS (Malaysia Airlines).

There was speculation two bottles with Asian writing on them may have come from the plane but there was no confirmation this was the case.\nFAMILIES REACT TO THE NEWS: ‘I selfishly hope this is not MH370’\nMeanwhile, authorities are tempering expectations that a suitcase found on the same beach is linked to the missing airliner.\nIt washed ashore at the same location as the aircraft flaperon but as yet there is no confirmation the suitcase is linked to the earlier debris.\nThe latest news is an encouraging revelation for families of MH370 passengers and crew.\nThe wing flap is believed to be the first piece of wreckage from the Malaysia Airlines’ flight that went missing on March 8, 2014.\nMH370: Your questions answered\nAlthough Malaysia has sent investigators to Reunion Island in the wake of the discovery, the French Bureau of Civil Aviation will deal with the flaperon at its Toulouse facility.\nOther items found on the beach including the suitcase and a bottle of milk were considered less likely to have come from the missing plane.\nFamilies and experts said they were pleased to hear of the French involvement, after more than a year of frustration dealing with Malaysian authorities.\nPleased to hear of the French involvement ...
