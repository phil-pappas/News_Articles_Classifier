No one quite remembers how the old oak tree - now a stump - off Hwy. 135 became laden with old mugs up and down its trunk. Located on private property along Cup Tree Drive, you’ll know you’re getting close when you see a newer oddity - the shoe fence. It features single and pairs of shoes some with signatures and inscriptions. 2. The Bedboard Fence While you’re in the Hwy. 135 vicinity, it’s a simple matter to drive by the bed fence that lines the front yard of a home on the highway that connects Stover and Laurie. The fence located a few miles north of Cup Tree Drive features brightly colored metal headboards and footboards. This quirky send-off of the white picket fence is another fun reminder of the independent Ozark spirit. 3. Charcoal Kilns of Iberia Less quirky and more historical are the charcoal kilns of Miller County. Built in the mid-20th century, the little huts were used to burn down wood into charcoal for several years with around 10 built on a hillside south of Iberia to the east of Highway 17. They are still visible today as you travel south toward Crocker. 4. Injun Joe on the Strip The Injun Joe statue is a landmark of the Bagnell Dam Strip. The larger-than-life Lake area icon has been saluting visitors to the historic entertainment center for decades. Injun Joe is a Muffler Man statue which were built by a California boat maker in the 1960s and ranged in height from 18-25 feet tall. 5. Swinging Bridges Two historic swinging bridges can be on Swinging Bridges Road which connects Route 42 in Miller County, west of Brumley, and Route A in Camden County that leads to Highway 54 in Linn Creek. The larger Auglaize Bridge spans 400 feet with wood planks that clatter as you cross, while Mill Creek Bridge has a 125-foot span of steel planks.
