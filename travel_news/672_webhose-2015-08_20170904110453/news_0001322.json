New ride-sharing alternatives — such as Via, Bandwagon, Tripda and RideWith — are springing up in major cities and at airports. At the same time, established car services like Uber and Lyft are continuing to expand to more corners of the world while adding bells and whistles like Starbucks rewards points, free beach bags and on-demand water taxis.\nWhen it comes to ride-sharing and car-pooling, apps and services are mushrooming.\nAmong the many players in that world is Via , a Manhattan-based ride-sharing app with a flat fee: $5 per person (plus tax) for trips purchased in advance through the app’s “ride credit” feature, which can be replenished in $25 or $50 increments. If you don’t fund your “ride credit” account, it’s $7 a ride.\nThe Getaway Each week, Stephanie Rosenbloom helps travelers get the most out of their trips, with reviews, deals and tips.
