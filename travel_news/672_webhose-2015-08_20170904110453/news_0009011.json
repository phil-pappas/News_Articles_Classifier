It features 8 seats in Business class and 176 seats in Economy class. The airline plans to operate the A321 aircraft on the high demand medium-range routes.\nTransaero continues to optimize its aircraft fleet under its Business Enhancement Programme and Fleet Renewal Programme. Transaero’s fleet is being expanded with new fuel efficient aircraft with optimal passenger capacity for the current market conditions. The airline will also withdraw from its fleet the aircraft of lower demand in the current economic conditions.\nBy the end of 2015 two more Airbus A321 aircraft will join Transaero’s fleet in addition to the two Airbus A321 and one Boeing 737-800 received earlier this year. At the same time, Transaero withdraws widebody aircraft from its fleet, which are of twice passenger capacity over the passenger capacity of the new arriving aircraft.\nIn line with the airline’s strategy, the fleet optimization will allow to enhance the quality of Transaero’s fleet and reduce its operating costs.\nSource:- Transaero Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:34:55.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
