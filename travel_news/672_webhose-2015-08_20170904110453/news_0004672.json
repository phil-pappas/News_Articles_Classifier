Turbin said there was no specific incident that led to the torn labrums, just gradual wear and tear that built up.\n“It progressively got worse and after the season last year I just felt like if I going to get better, really get better as a football player, I have to find out what is wrong internally in my body because even when I’m out here playing football and I may be doing some things very well, I could feel when something is not right,’’ he said. “I’m very blessed to be able to find those things and fix them.’’\nTurbin, who has 928 yards in three years with the Seahawks and has never missed a game, had surgery at The Steadman Clinic in Vail, Colo.\nWhen he returned, Seattle coaches noticed a difference.\n“He looks great,’’ said Sherman Smith, who coaches Seattle running backs. “He looks like the surgeries were successful in helping achieve his goals of getting looseness in his hips and whatever that was bothering him. He’s always going to be awesome in terms of knowing what to do. Now I think his physical skills are going to show through a lot more.’’\nThat couldn’t come at a better time for Turbin, who is entering a critical season in his career. His initial four-year rookie contract runs out after this season. At some point, maybe next year, the Seahawks will need an heir apparent to Lynch. Whether that will be Turbin could be decided on how he does this year. Third-year tailback Christine Michael also remains in that conversation.\nTurbin, though, says he isn’t worried about his future, content for now that his surgically repaired hips should allow him to make the most of his present.\n“I’m not concerned with it at all,’’ said Turbin, due to make $660,000 this season. “Not in the least bit. I’m really just relaxed, chilling. Everybody asks me how I feel and I’m just chilling. I don’t have a lot to say. There’s not much for me to talk about. Just here and thankful and just ready to play a little bit of football.’’\nNotes • Drew Nowak got the first snaps at center with the first-team offense, and coach Pete Carroll said it was indicative that he remains in the race with Lemuel Jeanpierre to replace Max Unger . Carroll said earlier in camp that Jeanpierre would be the starter if the season started today. But after the scrimmage Saturday, Carroll said, “That was earlier. Drew Nowak is doing a really good job right now. He’s getting a great shot to show us how he fits together in there.’’\n• The scrimmage featured four interceptions — one each by cornerbacks Cary Williams , Will Blackmon (returned for a 100-yard touchdown), Mohammed Seisay and another by safety Steven Terrell . Carroll said that three corners having interceptions is indicative of what he says is heated competition for the right cornerback spot and nickelback. Williams, signed as a free agent to a three-year, $18 million deal, has been running as the starter at right corner opposite Richard Sherman , with Blackmon as the nickel.\n“I want to leave the competition on here for the nickel spot and Cary’s got to push, too,’’ Carroll said. “Cary’s got all the experience you would ever want, but I don’t want to just close the door on the other guys. Tharold Simon is going to come back in a couple of weeks now, too. So it was great to see Mo Seisay make a good play today. Will Blackmon is also in the competition over there, so we’ll just let those guys keep going over there and see what happens.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:06:52.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
