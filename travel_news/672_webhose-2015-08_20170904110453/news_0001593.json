Six other survivors were taken by helicopter to hospitals, and 26 bodies have been recovered.\nThe suspects were arrested for investigation of multiple counts of manslaughter and aiding illegal immigration, and of belonging to a criminal organization based in Libya, from where the overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels set sail.\nAn Italian officer takes a photo of a baby as migrants disembark from the Italian Coast Guard ship Fiorillo in the harbor of Pozzallo, near Ragusa, Sicily, Italy, Friday, Aug. 7, 2015.

(AP Photo/Carmelo Imbesi) \"According to some of the witness accounts, these criminals allegedly each had a precise role,\" the police statement said. \"One of these, along with two others, commanded the boat; the others were tasked with controlling the migrants, impeding them from moving, even by using violence.\"\nThe five \"allegedly caused the ascertained deaths of 26 people and the presumed deaths of about 200, who, according to what witnesses say, were closed inside the boat which overturned,\" the police said.\nThe International Organization for Migration said survivors told its staff that up to 250 people had been forced to sit in the hold — \"the most dangerous part of the ship.\"\nPeople line up to enter a center for migrants after disembarking from the Italian Coast Guard ship Fiorillo in the harbor of Pozzallo, near Ragusa, Sicily, Italy, Friday, Aug. 7, 2015.

Italian military helicopters lowered inflatable rafts.\nMigrants paid $1,200 to $1,800 each for passage. Safer places on board cost more; life vests were sold separately for $25-$50, police said.\nThe passengers included Palestinians, Syrians, Eritreans, sub-Saharan Africans and some 150 migrants from Bangladesh, authorities said.\nA woman carries a baby as she boards a bus after disembarking from the Italian Coast Guard ship Fiorillo in the harbor of Pozzallo, near Ragusa, Sicily, Italy, Friday, Aug. 7, 2015.

In April, a fishing boat which reportedly had about 800 aboard overturned and sank as rescuers approached. Only 28 survivors were found.\nMost of the rescued migrants hope to win asylum in northern Europe, where they have relatives. Some anti-immigration politicians in Europe contend the rescue operations only encourage more migrants to tempt their fate at sea.\nPope Francis on Friday said refusing to help migrants at sea is tantamount to killing them.\nMigrants wait to disembark from the Italian Coast Guard ship Fiorillo in the harbor of Pozzallo, near Ragusa, Sicily, Italy, Friday, Aug. 7, 2015.
