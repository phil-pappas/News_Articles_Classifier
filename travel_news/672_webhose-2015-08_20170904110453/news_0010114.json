Hice Applauds Economic Impact Of Hotel Industry On Tour Of The Ritz-Carlton, Reynolds PlantatIon\nCongressman Jody Hice (GA-10) praised the job growth of the Georgia hotel industry today on a “Heart of the House” hotel tour of The Ritz-Carlton, Reynolds Plantation.The tour of the 251-room resort property emphasized the important role the hotel industry plays in supporting jobs and economic growth in the surrounding communities, as well as the various career opportunities within the hotel industry.\nThe resort tour was led by The Ritz-Carlton, Reynolds Plantation General Manager Ralph Vick. The “Heart of the House” hotel tour provided Congressman Hice and his staff an opportunity to walk through the property, meet with employees and get a deeper understanding of the impact the hotel industry has on the local economy.\n“It was a pleasure to tour the picturesque Ritz-Carlton, Reynolds Plantation. Hotels are a significant generator in boosting the state and local economies, and this property is a leader in giving back to the community,” said Congressman Hice. “Not only does this resort promote job creation with a pathway to career opportunities for all its employees, but the industry is a key driver of tourism across the great state of Georgia.”\nGeorgia’s hotels are an important segment of the state economy with 7.6 percent of all jobs in the state directly or indirectly related to the lodging industry. Georgia generates $1.7 billion in tax revenue for the state and local governments. Many of Georgia’s properties are small businesses, a segment of the economy responsible for 44 percent of jobs in the state. This industry reaches beyond simply providing guests with comfortable room or convenient meeting spaces – they are interlinked with many other industries such as, transportation, restaurants, agriculture, manufacturing, and recreation, supporting $6.7 billion in total sales throughout the state.\n“Congressman Hice understands how essential the hotel industry is to Georgia’s jobs and economy,” said General Manager Ralph Vick. “We applaud his efforts to help increase travel and tourism while promoting ways to boost economic growth and development so that we can continue to succeed.”\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA), the sole national association representing all segments of the 1.8 million-employee lodging industry, works with state associations to engage with members of Congress on the “Heart of the House” hotel tours, which provide an in-depth look at the career opportunities available as well as the economic impact the lodging industry has on the local, state and national economies.\nSource:- AHLA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T06:24:20.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
