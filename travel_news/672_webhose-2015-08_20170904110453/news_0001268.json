OneJet, a carrier that services small and medium-sized markets with nonstop flights, is continuing its planned route expansion with nonstop service between Nashville, Tenn., and its current hub at Indianapolis International Airport beginning Sept. 8. The flight — less than 90 minutes flying time — will serve a growing corporate travel base between the two cities, and is scheduled to run during the business week, Monday through Thursday. OneJet launched in April providing business travelers with nonstop service between Indianapolis and Milwaukee on seven-seat Hawker 400 jets. OneJet now provides nonstop flights to Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Memphis, Tenn. Its expansion plan will add around one aircraft per month and up to 12 new destinations and/or focus cities throughout 2016, with Milwaukee a possible focus city in the future. “The addition of Nashville as a destination city is part of OneJet’s multi-phase expansion plan to grow our network of nonstop regional travel,” Matthew Maguire , OneJet CEO, said in the release. “Nashville has been one of the key destinations demanded by both Indianapolis corporate and community leadership. The introduction of Nashville provides an immediate, highly accessible nonstop travel solution for our Indianapolis bound or originating customers and we believe, in the longer term, represents a highly productive addition to our overall network.” OneJet offers two nonstop destinations from Milwaukee — Indianapolis and Pittsburgh. \nWant Milwaukee Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:55:53.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
