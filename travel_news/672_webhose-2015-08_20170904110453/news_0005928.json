Here are five options to consider. \n• Steamboat Grand Resort and Condominiums, Steamboat Springs, Colo. The hotel offers easy access to mountain activities, including gondola rides, biking and zip-lining. A free shuttle makes it simple to sample downtown dining and shopping with the kids. \nRelax on a float tube on the Yampa River or visit the nearby Strawberry Park Hot Springs. \nChoose from spacious hotel-style rooms that open to living areas designed with futonlike sleeping spaces and pullout sofas. An in-room kitchen makes family dining affordable. \nVisit steamboatgrand.com and steamboatchamber.com \n• Bethany Beach Ocean Suites, Bethany Beach, Del. The recently opened 112-suite property is the first and only lodging option directly on the historic boardwalk. \nDirect access to the beach makes it easy for families to manage nap schedules, snacks and all the gear required for a day of sea, sand and sun. \nSuites have balconies, kitchenettes and pullout couches. \nVisit bboceansuites.com \n• Radisson Blu Warwick Hotel, Philadelphia. Book the Kids Kamping package for extra sleeping space with a twist. While the adults climb into traditional bedding, kids can snooze inside a full-size tent that comes with pillows, blankets and a teddy bear. The landmark hotel also offers s’mores as a bedtime treat. \nVisit radissonblu.com/hotel-philadelphia \n• Vacation rentals. If you need plenty of room to roam, a rental might be the right fit. With more companies making it easier to review the experiences of previous guests, compare and book, it can make sense to choose a loft, cabin, condo or home with the number of beds, baths, amenities and location that suits your crew. \nVisit airbnb.com , homeaway.com and VRBO.com . \n• Hipmunk. Confused as to whether to book multiple hotel rooms or a vacation rental? \nHipmunk’s search engine makes it possible to easily compare the amenities, sleeping spaces and price for both options without toggling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T16:39:31.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
