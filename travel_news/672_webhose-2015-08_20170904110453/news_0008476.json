That blue sky which rainy Paris envies certainly has something to do with the appeal of this famous, but often overlooked, southern French pleasure centre.\nIt was the English Lord Brougham who, escaping what he called his native \"fog-land\", created Cannes after being detained here by a cholera quarantine in 1834. He escaped the disease, but succumbed to the simple charm of what was then a fishing village. Maybe he even liked the food, 19th-century French peasants eating rather better than their English equivalents.\nIn milord's day there was no choice other than to stay at Monsieur Pinchinat's Hôtel de la Poste aux Chevaux. The better to serve his needs, Brougham built an Italianate villa and named it Eléonore Louise, after his daughter. She died. Brougham himself is now buried alongside Negrin in the Cimetière du Grand Jas, near Peter-Carl Fabergé, son of the egg man; and Pablito Picasso (who killed himself shortly after his grandfather's death). But Brougham's real monument was to have conceptualised the modern holiday resort.\nThe cemetery's associations of jewellery and art are significant: they are still very much dans le vent. Fashionable money followed Brougham. The English who settled here were outraged when the railway arrived in 1863, cutting off their new villas from the sea and bringing the wrong sort of person. The SNCF frontier still defines the town. In 1912, Henri Ruhl, a Swiss hotelier already established in Nice, built the swaggering Carlton Hotel and the style of Cannes we recognise from film publicity was established.\nEventually, just as the milordi had replaced the indigenous scrub of herby maquis with their incongruous green English lawns, their own villas were demolished and their estates broken up into flats on the wrong side of the tracks.\nCannes could not be described as anybody's poor neighbour, but it is smaller than next-door Nice and, despite the well-reported antics of preening publicity hounds at the annual film festival, much less well-known. And there are significant differences.\nNice's Promenade des Anglais is wide and airy, while Cannes' sea-side Croisette is more narrow and congested. The Niçois, not meaning to be kind, call it the promenade des puces. On the land side in high season, it is impossible to navigate a pavement clogged by young, wealthy families with two-seater buggies who shop windows of the very same expensive and glittery merchandise you find in airports.\nNor is Cannes' natural position quite as fine as Nice's. You cannot see the snowy Alpes-Maritimes from the beach. And the sea seems somehow smaller even if, as Scott Fitzgerald colourfully wrote, it remains \"as mysteriously coloured as the agate and cornelian of childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry water\". Today, the colourful integrity of Cannes as a whole is strictly enforced by €180 (£128) fines for dropping cigarette ends or litter. It seems to have worked. The city is notably neat and tidy.\nI was in Cannes for the annual Cannes Lions convention, where nearly 30,000 advertising and marketing heroes, hustlers, voyeurs, victims, dupes and hangers-on swell the number of Gulf families and Russians, honking and braying in every over-crowded Croisette bar every hot night. Meanwhile, on the beach, the ex-Soviet Union has now usurped Germany's role as apex-predator. This is not what Aldous Huxley meant when he said Cannes was turning us all into pagans.\nPizza Cresci on the waterfront I checked in early to a favourite place to stay, the Hôtel de Provence. Even if the reception boasts photographs of Sarkozy and Hollande, this is a delightful family-run hotel which achieves the rare balance of being very comfortable while being very relaxed. One block from the sea in a quiet area, it is a tall and narrow ochre-coloured building whose best rooms have sunny verandas overlooking a dense, shaded tropical garden.\nThen, as the Festival approached and a professional obligation loomed, I moved into grander, but much less lovely, accommodation at the Hôtel Martinez, the 1929 representative of Art Deco along the white rococo cliff of hotels that defines Cannes' cheerful seaside. Alas, the Martinez has recently been taken over by Hyatt, whose corporate hand now lies heavily on its bubbly Jazz Age esprit.\nThere are three outstanding places to eat in Cannes. Obviously, you avoid the steep and winding rue Saint-Antoine which leads sweaty conga lines of post-Brougham tourists up the heights to Le Suquet, the old fortress of the Oxybians, past a lot of very surly and comically over-priced restaurants.\nInstead, after the beach, I established a reliable routine like this: An apéro at Le Petit Zinc, a hole-in-the wall at the narrowest and least popular end of the rue Meynadier, one of Cannes' main thoroughfares. Here, a very friendly tattooed lady serves nearly frozen rosé and a bowl of crisps while a corpulent proprietress looks on, amiably smoking a cheroot. Hyatt could learn a thing or two.\nThen you need to eat. Always first choice is Astoux & Brun, near the Hôtel de Ville, a white-tiled feature of Cannes since 1953. This is a very noisy seafood restaurant and there is no booking, so avoid 8 o'clock and arrive early or at the lull occurring around 9pm. The maître d' stands on the pavement with a clipboard and a pea whistle: you never have to wait too long. The menu is predictable, unchanging and laminated, but whatever would you want to change about crevettes grises and a whole fresh crab with a bottle of sharp, local white ?\nVieux Port (Palais des Festivals & des Congrès/Herve Fabre) Aux Bons Enfants is a finer affair, but also has no booking so you need to pass by earlier in the day and ask for a coveted seat outside. It is now serving its third generation of cuisine famille provençale, a tradition which began 80 years ago. They say it is all sourced from the nearby Marché Forville. So you do not look for innovation, but eat petits farcis, the local stuffed vegetables, lapin au moutarde or a more vogue-ish slow-cooked belly pork. Everything comes with a scalding hot tub of what I eventually identified as a gratin of squash. Put it this way: in a week, I visited three times.\nThen there is Pizza Cresci, a huge, red-canopied establishment which has been on the quay of the yacht-chandlers since 1960. Here you stop off on your way to or from the boat, or a heli, to Saint-Tropez. I think it the best pizza ever, so vast it is served only in semi-circles, never a whole portion, and comes with a base which achieves a perfect rapport between the crisp and the unctuous, while beneath is a very convincing residue of black-burnt flour dust from the roaring wood-fired ovens.\nForget the caviare and champagne, I cannot imagine anything more delicious than a Cresci Quatres Fromages with a bottle of Ott or Minuty, the best Provençal rosés, or a robust bottle of Vin de Cresci Rouge. The ingredients are superb and the flavours precise. Later, if your voyeurism remains alert even if your appetite is satisfied, a drink on the terrace of M Ruhl's Carlton Terrace to watch the beau monde wear their shopping.\nI have an old book with gravure reproductions of photographs showing fishermen slumbering in fishing boats bobbing quietly in the calm waters of the Vieux Port. Not today they are not: their idyll and Lord Brougham's idyll are over. Cannes may be much less of a magnet for superyachts than Nice, Monte-Carlo and Saint-Tropez, but that culture does exist. The Martinez, for example, has a notable excess of Rolls-Royces and Ferraris parked in its courtyard.\nYet, I think Cannes is a lovely place. Not least because it presents all the wonders and absurdities of the Côte d'Azur in a single compact package. No-one caught this magic better than Fitzgerald: \"The resplendent names – Cannes, Nice, Monte-Carlo – began to glow through their torpid camouflage, whispering of old kings come here to dine or to die, of rajahs tossing Buddhas' eyes to English ballerinas, of Russian princes turning the weeks into Baltic twilight in the lost caviare days\". Well, yes. Cannes made its reputation with earls, princes, maharajahs and Hollywood royalty, with baccarat at the Cercle Nautique, disaster and triumph at the Casino, battles of flowers, Edward Quinn photographing Brigitte Bardot, and tipsy dancing at costume galas.\nIn the lost caviare day when I was leaving Cannes, French taxi-drivers were on strike, protesting about Uber. I was trapped with a plane to catch in Nice, 25km away. Cars of any sort could not be had for love nor money and Cannes has ample amounts of each. In smart places such as Cannes, Uber offers a helicopter service. I tried it, but Ubercopter was unavailable, through over-demand or voluntary grounding I cannot say. I went to the airport on a chartered bus, but the magic did not entirely disappear.\nGetting there \nNice – just along the coast from Cannes – is served by a number of airlines from the UK, such as easyJet, Monarch, and British Airways.\nStaying there \nHotel de Provence, 9 rue Molière (0033 4 93 38 44 35; hotel-de-provence.com ).
