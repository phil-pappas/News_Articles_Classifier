A colleague made the discovery and sent her a link to the story, she said.\n\"It's just so gratifying to be listed among destinations such as California, Hawaii and Myrtle Beach, your typical tourist destinations,\" she said.\nMackenzie said her inn's price point was kept affordable on purpose so that more people could enjoy the Gulf Coast.\nClick here to read the full Yahoo Travel article.\nFront Beach Cottages opened in October 2011 and is made up of four 1940s and '50s-era fishing shacks that have been fully renovated: the Key West Cabana, Nola Cottage, Lagniappe Cottage and Bellande Cottage.\nMackenzie bought the property in 2008, she said, and believed the cottages had more potential as vacation rental properties than for long-term tenants.\n\"I am an attorney and I work for a casino, and I've worked in hospitality for 15 years, always on the back of the house side,\" she said.\nIn that role, \"my guest interaction is somewhat limited,\" she said, and her day job \"primarily involves people who aren't too happy.\"\nBut as an inn owner, she said, she enjoys meeting her guests and helping them explore the Gulf Coast and the city she loves so much.\nMackenzie said she loves Ocean Springs because it is unique has \"a cool artist open lifestyle vibe.\"\nWith a strong and smart mayor, progressive ideals, creative residents and a tourism-friendly atmosphere, Ocean Springs is a good place to own a hotel, she said.\n\"I think that people are looking for that real authentic experience,\" she said. \"It's like a postcard when you go into our downtown. You can still bring your dog to the beach and park without paying. If you have a beer on the beach, no one is going to hassle you. It's a real, authentic create-your-own-experience kind of place.\"\nMackenzie said she encourages her guests to explore the whole Gulf Coast when they visit.\n\"I see us as one land mass from New Orleans to Mobile that shares more in common than anything north of I-10,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/travel/10-amazing-beach-hotels-under-100-126321448702.html"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T01:47:57.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
