Certainly cleaning and maintaining it can sometimes feel like a chore, but there are things you can do to make it easier. Take the expert advice of Richard Tipper of Perfection Detailing , who has spent the past 26 years perfecting his routine for cleaning and restoring the world’s finest cars, old and new. With this advice, the neighbours will always think you have a new car. The first thing, Richard says, is to equip yourself with three basics: a pressure washer, a good quality lambswool wash mitt and a soft dedicated drying towel. Most fine scratches are inflicted during the washing process, so these will help prevent that basic mistake. If you can afford it, a car-specific blow dryer is also a good idea. This will allow you to blow water out of areas that are impossible to get to and stop water from dripping out of nooks and crannies when you drive off. With the basics in hand, here’s how to care for your car like a pro. 1. Learn to polish properly “The biggest mistake people make is using far too much product,” says Richard. “A couple of penny-sized dollops on a suitable applicator pad is more than enough for a 2ft area. The polish should be worked into the paint in straight lines ensuring thorough coverage of the whole area. Leave it for the instructed length of time before removing and buffing with a suitable microfibre cloth. Using the right amount also ensures nooks and crannies don't get clogged up with excess polish that then dries white and powdery in all the areas you least want it to.” 2. Become a glass master “Of the hundreds of glass-cleaning products on the market I regularly resort to the simplest method I've used for years. I have two microfibre cloths, one is damp and the other is clean and dry. I wipe the glass thoroughly with the damp one then before the smears have evaporated I quickly use the dry one to buff the glass to a crystal-clear finish.” 3. Don’t forget the nooks and crannies “Door hinges and door sills often get forgotten. Whilst grease is essential on 'metal on metal' moving parts, the dirt that accumulates in this area is often the first thing that grabs the eye when opening the door.” 4. Seal those wheels “Wheels get a lot of abuse from varying temperatures and brake dust. It’s well worth applying a wheel sealant when they're new (and regularly thereafter) to prevent the brake dust from bonding to the wheel in the first place. You'll never stop wheels from getting dirty but cleaning at least once a week will keep them from deteriorating too much. You’ll want some decent wheel brushes: I use \"Wheel woolies\", which allow you safely to get in and around every part of the wheel including the back of it.” 5. Watch out for bugs “The simplest and best advice I can give when it comes to removing dead bugs is to get them off quickly. If your paint is well polished and protected, contaminants will find it harder to bond to the paintwork. However given time the acids present in the bugs will eat through the paint/clear coat and will leave unsightly stains that will need to be aggressively polished out. Act faster if you have a paint protection film rather than a lacquer; it’s softer and will stain more quickly.” • Follow Richard Tipper on Twitter @perfectionvalet Do you want to help look after your engine?
