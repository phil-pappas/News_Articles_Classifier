Not so super Cooper 0:39 Play video\nNRL: Storm halfback Cooper Cronk is known for his attention to detail but has had a nightmare against the Titans coming up with two errors off two different kick offs.\nFox Sports 09 Aug 2015 Sport/NRL Munster finished with a hat-trick but the biggest cheers of the day by the Melbourne fans were reserved for winger Matt Duffie, playing his third game since early 2013.\nThe 24-year-old, who has undergone two knee and shoulder reconstructions in his short career, scored a try in each half and had another disallowed.\nThe Titans, who were again without injured skipper Nate Myles, started brightly with Aiden Sezer slotting a penalty after nine minutes. The Titans struggle to handle big Kevin Proctor.

Matt Duffie celebrates his second try. Source: News Corp Australia\nThey got some revenge soon after when Koroibete missed a Sezer high kick and Josh Hoffman won the scramble to the ball.\nBut the Storm finished in style with centre Will Chambers making a charge to the line before Munster collected another two to cap an impressive day out.\nMELBOURNE 36 (C Munster 3 M Duffie 2 W Chambers M Koroibete tries C Smith 4 goals) bt GOLD COAST 14 (K Elgey J Hoffman tries A Sezer 3 goals) at AAMI Park.
