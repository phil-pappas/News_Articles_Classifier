Now, vehicles have moved into the accommodation business. This unique concept has been gaining considerable ground in one of the most expensive hotel cities in the world.\nUsing large vans, a man named Jonathan Powley is advertising on Airbnb and actually attracting customers. For just US$22 per night Powley will park a van in non-tow locations throughout the city near some of the most visited tourist sites in Manhattan.\nYou can't just step out of your sleeper van and go to the washroom, so Powley positions customer vehicles as near as possible to public washrooms. After a few nights you may want to find a gym for a shower or people will sense your presence in the van as they walk by. Apparently there are a number of van options to choose from with varying prices. They are simply but effectively dressed up to make them at least somewhat appealing.\nFor the time being at least, the service is perfectly legal. There is little doubt that other entrepreneurs in other urban centres will follow and perhaps, like Uber, become a franchised player.\n\nThe roads we travel\nDuring the summer months, much of the travel we do is taken in our automobiles. Whether to nearby Manitoba lakes, or longer trips taking our families to other parts of this great country, we count on our vehicles to get us there and back without incident. As we drive from town to town, city to city and province to province we are sure to encounter roads and highways not in the best of shape. We may express frustration at their condition, but what we may not know is those inferior road conditions are hitting our pocketbooks.\nStudies in the United States have estimated that bad roads are costing drivers an average of US$500 annually for repairs, strictly because of deteriorating roads. We know that Winnipeg and other Canadian centres can become pothole havens every spring. They can go unrepaired for months. In Manitoba, our public insurance program often takes on the repairs for major damages, but the less obvious costs of wear and tear caused by bad roads slowly deteriorate the value of vehicles\nThe U.S. study concluded the damage to vehicles is worse in cities. The transportation research group TRIP analyzes this is the case because of a lack of investment by all levels of government, and car repairs are the hidden taxes for travel.\n\nMemories of war\nI have often written about our need to commemorate the events and people of past wars, recent and ancient, by visiting these places of history. One such place marked its anniversary a few days ago, while a second will take place Sunday.\nOn Aug. 6, 1945, the world of wars changed with the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki 70 years ago Sunday. These bombs would signal the end of the Second World War, as the massive devastation of the two cities was chronicled.\nI visited Nagasaki with my son some time ago in our visit to Japan where, by happenstance, he celebrated his 21st birthday. It proved to be an awakening to the horrors of war for him, and in many ways for me as well. I had previously visited the Canadian cemetery at Holten in the Netherlands and was touched by the crosses row on row marking the places of our fallen soldiers.\nBut, seeing the remains of the devastating impact of the atomic bomb proved to be a different awakening. And for both of us, it left an enduring imprint that has stayed with us throughout the intervening years.\nAfter the war, Japan committed itself to becoming a peaceful nation that would forever educate its people, and others around the world about its terrible past through their preservation of the bombed sites, and photos of the effects the blasts had on people who experienced fallout from the bombs.\nThe Nagasaki Peace Memorial, which is held annually in Nagasaki Peace Park, will take place Sunday near the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum. There, a bronze statue of a figure with one hand pointing up to the sky and the other pointing sideways over the sea of destruction was erected as an emotional reminder of the events of that week and the years that followed. Nearby stands a black obelisk which marks the epicentre of the bomb's blast, placed beside part of a large cathedral which was destroyed when the bomb exploded.\nWhile at times I have wondered why we have a fascination about these destinations of past wars, that visit informed me completely.\n\nForward your travel questions to pradinukr@shaw.ca Ron Pradinuk is a Winnipeg travel writer and broadcaster who can be heard Sundays at noon on CJOB, or read Ron's travel blog at thattravelguy.ca.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:31:26.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
