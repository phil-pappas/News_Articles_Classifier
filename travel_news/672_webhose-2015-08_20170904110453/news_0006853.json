AutoPacific's IVA is based on over 66,000 surveys completed by new-car owners in the first half of 2015 and recognizes products that most closely meet buyer requirements and expectations. Based on the responses from vehicle owners, the survey encompasses the vehicle's ride and handling, driver's seat comfort, interior storage, safety features, engine power and acceleration, and technology.\n\"The introduction of the Cadenza was a response to customer demand for a Kia product that was larger and even more luxurious than the SXL trims of our Sorento CUV and Optima midsize sedan, and as our first step into the premium segments, it helped continue the transformation of the Kia brand, paving the way to our luxury flagship sedan, the K900,\" said Orth Hedrick , Vice President, Product Planning, Kia Motors America (KMA). \"AutoPacific's Ideal Vehicle Award is important because it represents the voice of the customer and offers confirmation that the Cadenza's blend of world-class design, quality and features is hitting the mark with Kia owners.\"\nThe IVA is Cadenza's second honor from AutoPacific in 2015, following a Vehicle Satisfaction Award (VSA) earlier this summer.\nAbout AutoPacific\nAutoPacific is a future-oriented automotive marketing research and product-consulting firm.
