The company’s net income declined to $5.8 million in April through June, down roughly 84 percent from more than $37 million it posted during the same period last year. If SeaWorld (NYSE: SEAS) shareholders were hoping new President and CEO Joel Manby could provide a quick fix for what ails the theme park company, there is plenty of disappointment this week. SeaWorld’s second-quarter revenue fell from $405.2 million in 2014 to $391.6 million in 2015, a 3.4 percent drop. Meanwhile, total attendance declined from nearly 6.6 million visitors to less than 6.5 million park guests over the same period. Manby, who became CEO of the company in early April, has attributed the decrease in attendance to a number of factors, including “continued brand challenges,” particularly in California. Financial results for the first half of 2015 may cause greater concern for SeaWorld shareholders. While the company attracted about 63,000 additional guests during the first six months of this year compared with the first two quarters in 2014, its overall financial performance deteriorated significantly. SeaWorld suffered a net loss of $37.8 million in the first half of 2015. The company’s net loss during the same period a year ago was $11.8 million. Manby said SeaWorld officials have plenty of work ahead to rebuild the theme parks’ attendance base and to increase the company’s revenue and overall performance. He also said in a press statement that returning SeaWorld to “historical performance levels will take time and investment.” SeaWorld faces competitive challenges in Florida, and the company has had to adjust some of its capital investment plans to address them. But the bigger challenge for SeaWorld is continued fallout from the film “Blackfish,” which documented the killing of one of its trainers, Dawn Brancheau, by an orca at the company’s Orlando theme park. Some groups continue to call for boycotts at SeaWorld parks in protest over the company’s practices. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on Thursday that Manby told analysts SeaWorld would support a pending congressional investigation governing the treatment of captive mammals, provided federal standards were based on science. \nWant San Antonio Travel news in your inbox?
