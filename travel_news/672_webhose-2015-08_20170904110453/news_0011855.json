It features distinct zones offering the choice of areas to dine, work and relax.\nDesigned by Woods Bagot, the Business Lounge design draws on regional influences through architectural finishes based on the unique Western Australian landscape such as terracotta and metallic feature walls representing the mineral-rich soil. The colour palette is drawn from Margaret River, Matilda Bay, Wave Rock and Broome.\nSpeaking at the launch event, Qantas Domestic CEO Andrew David said the new Perth Domestic Business Lounge would offer the airline’s premium flyers outstanding service, luxury design and premium food and wine.\n“This lounge sets the new benchmark in business travel and represents the future of the Qantas Business Lounge in Australia,” said Mr David.\n“The lounge has been designed with our most frequent travellers from WA in mind. It accommodates the mix of corporate, leisure and fly-in fly-out workers with business facilities, a sports lounge to relax and socialise, and dining areas with single and communal seating,” said Mr David.\nMr David said the opening of the new lounge demonstrated Qantas’ commitment to Western Australia.\n“Perth, and broader Western Australia, is extremely important to our network. We’ve recommenced direct services to Singapore, we are developing our dedicated airport precinct and within the next six months the majority of our East – West flights will be operated by a reconfigured A330,” he said.\nOur new airport space will deliver a better travel and airport experience for Qantas customers with improved gate access, faster security screening, quicker check in and now more lounge facilities.”\nSpeaking at the event, Perth-born Businesswoman, fashion designer, model and actress Megan Gale said she spends a lot of time in airport lounges so it was important to have a space to work and relax before her flight.\n“I travel to and from Perth regularly for work and to visit my family and I’m really looking forward to starting my journey in this beautiful and spacious lounge. I love the local design influences, it’s so nice to walk into something that feels like home,” Ms Gale said.\nCustomers travelling through the lounge will be the first to enjoy two brand new Business Lounge dining concepts – a state of the art Italian pizza bar with a pizza chef, and a wine bar where customers can sit and enjoy barista coffee and freshly made croissants in the morning and a glass of wine and canapés in the evening.\nThe new lounge features menus designed by Neil Perry, a ‘make your own’ juice station in the morning, cocktail hour from 4 – 5pm on weekdays with cocktails designed by the Rockpool Mixology team and a generous fresh hot and cold buffet.\nCustomers can also enjoy a ‘plate of the day’ from the central island dining tables on weekdays. This includes dishes such as baked eggs with chorizo and feta in the morning and gourmet cheese plates in the evening.\nThe addition of a Qantas Business Lounge will complete Qantas’ suite of domestic lounges at Perth Airport with a Chairman’s Lounge and Qantas Club already in operation.\nQantas currently operates four Business Lounges (Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne) which are a unique product in the domestic Australian market and provides a key point of difference for Qantas compared to other airlines.\nThe Perth Domestic Business Lounge is open to Qantas customers travelling in Business and Platinum and Platinum One Frequent Flyers.\nSource:- Qantas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:00:15.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
