The reviews have been mixed but the consensus seems to be that it’s revolutionary, sleek, smart, a sophisticated timepiece and a boost to your health. The question I had was: Does it travel well? I put in 175,000 miles a year and have counted on traditional watches for their ability to keep time, tell me the date, hold up under banging and knocking around and the occasional splash of liquid.\nThus far Apple has refused to release sales figures , which it’s usually quick to tout for new iPhones or iPads. In my travels, I am not really seeing many people wearing the watch, other than Apple employees. But I’m enternally curious about new tech so last month I purchased the larger 42mm Watch, one of three available models . I found the 38mm version more difficult to read because of its reduced size. I chose the “ Watch ” model, rather than either the “ Watch Sport ” or pricier “ Watch Edition .” The 42mm size is still scarce in the online store, so I made the trip to lower Manhattan and paid the $1,000 price tag, which is, in my view, pretty steep for a device that is not particularly beautiful or aesthetically pleasing. Of course, you can pay $17,000 for the gold “collection” model if you are one of the limited number of rich Apple tech-cult followers.\nFor the past six weeks I have been assessing its utility for travelers and whether the watch will add anything to my life beyond what my present watch can do. The results and my conclusions are mixed. What Apple calls a “watch” is really a wrist-sized computer that has the ability to display time and lots of other information. It is the 21st century equivalent of the Hamilton Pulsa r introduced in about 1972 as the first timepiece with an LED display and microprocessor. I am sure many (older) readers remember its sleek design, which at the time was the equivalent of the iPad in its radical departure from analog watches. Someone on YouTube dug up this now kitschy but somehow transfixing Pulsar promo reel from 1972. You have to watch at least the first minute to transport yourself back to the beginning of computer-time technology. While the Pulsar was primitive in its capabilities in comparison to Apple, it was far more rugged, ran on a battery for several months, and I think a more stylish as a piece of tech-jewelry.\nI am often overseas and routinely travel through many different time zones and to some very isolated areas. What I and most other professional voyagers need is a watch that can easily be set and will track home and destination time zones as well. We also need a day-date display. While alarms and timers are nice they are not needed because we all have smartphones. Most of all, we want a watch that can easily be read and that will withstand the rigors of travel in terms of water and environmental resistance, rugged design, and is comfortable to wear. We need a watch that will keep working. A good looking timepiece also makes a statement about its wearer, so most of us want one that reflects our lifestyle. To fit this bill, I have worn a series of Breitling watches for more than twenty years as well as the original Omega Speedmaster (the one that went to the moon).\nWhy? Because they are almost indestructible, have incredibly accurate movements, and rarely have maintenance problems. Breitling, like most other electronic watches, has a battery that lasts almost four years. The Apple Watch battery conks out after an average of about eighteen hours. While the Apple Watch is probably the most sophisticated wrist-computer, I would submit there are significant reasons why professional travelers may not want one. Here is what I learned from my interviews at two different Apple stores and their product specialists. I followed up with a detailed discussion with Apple senior technicians after I questioned a potential security issue tied to the wrist-movement sensor option.\nThe Apple Watch: Issues you should understand before you buy one\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.apple.com/watch/", "http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/hamilton-pulsar-p2-2900-led-digital-watch", "http://www.zdnet.com/article/where-are-the-official-apple-watch-sales-figures/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Speedmaster", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/a5szJYA_z44", "http://www.breitling.com/en/models/professional/emergency/"], "published": "2015-08-13T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:12:50.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
