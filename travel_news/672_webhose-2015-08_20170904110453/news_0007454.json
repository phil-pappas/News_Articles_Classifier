Ten-year-old Nolan Smith said he makes a bee-line for “the fish place” so he can start opening day at the fair with a solid win: a goldfish. Lindsey Vitiello is pinning her hopes on a win, too. The 11-year-old girl from Marshfield figures Isabelle, a very vocal Jersey cow that’s she’s cared for over the last several months, could bring home a ribbon in Sunday’s judging. Why? “She has good posture,” said Vitiello, as she sanded Isabelle’s horns and scrubbed manure off her front hooves. “And she puts herself on the right stand.” All around the fair’s livestock barn Friday, Vitiello and other 4-H girls from Marshfield and Duxbury cuddled up with their cows and goats on the honey-colored wood shavings in the pens. Rain threatened to douse the fun as the 148th Marshfield Fair opened its gates, but the thick gray clouds gave way to swaths of blue sky. Thunderstorms factor into the forecasts through Sunday. Leonard (Lenny) LaForest, the president of the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, was unfazed by Friday morning’s downpours. “The weather situation is going to be workable,” he said Friday afternoon as a quick shower cooled off fair goers in the muggy heat. “We’ll have highs and low at times depending on when it rains. But the rest of the week looks good.” Crowds were sparse much of the afternoon, and there were no lines at the Super Slides, Tilt-A-Whirl and Zipper Cage. Fair workers manning the games did their best to entice players, even rhyming couplets. “Grab a seat, rest your feet,” barked the lanky guy at Bob’s Space Racer where water guns begged for good aim. “We have a winner every race, a prize every time. Who’s next?” The prizes -- yellow, green and pink stuffed animals – dangled under the game’s awning and swayed in the breeze. Sandwiched between the livestock and the midway, Pembroke resident Lisa Mattei-McDonald lured hungry fairgoers to her tiny stand, cooking brisket and pulled pork sliders with purple coleslaw. Earlier this year, McDonald left her marketing job and ditched the daily commute to Boston to start a catering business, Tasteful Adventures. “It was time to do my own thing,” she said. She had a full view of the midway and all its eye-popping and deafening rides. The screams of kids and teenagers aboard the Freak Out – a massive twisting pendulum packed full of brave riders – rang out over the high-decibel music that blares from most rides. Page 2 of 2 - Fairgoers in search of quietude meandered into the horticultural and garden exhibit on the ground floor of the Agricultural Hall. Competitors in the garden and flower categories weren’t just from South Shore towns. Garden clubs from as far away as Marblehead, Newton and Westborough vied for ribbons. “We try to make people sit here,” said Lehage, pointing up inside the butterfly cage. Susie Farrell was just happy the rain stopped. “It poured buckets this mornig, and we were very nervous,” said Farrell, who had two children in tow. “We’ve been planning this all summer.” By Bu Chris Burrell   Bu Chris Burrell Posted Aug. 21, 2015 at 7:31 PM Updated at 7:37 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T13:30:08.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
