Private trains with rail cars exquisitely restored to belle epoque, art nouveau or art deco detail still ply the tracks with tours found ’round the world. While passengers may not travel with characters as quirky as those in an Agatha Christie train mystery, given the high style and exotic locations of some of the trips, the journeys can still attract an interesting set of fellow travelers. Or play the mystery guest yourself and relax in a vintage cabin while rolling past some fascinating part of the world.\nAlthough harder to find in North America, private luxury train journeys are numerous in Europe and also run in Asia, Africa, South America and Australia. While these are not budget trips, passengers can sign up for shorter — even two-day — versions of the journeys to make the experiences more affordable.\nVenice Simplon-Orient-Express Following routes of the original Orient Express, this art deco and art nouveau gem captures the elegant past with polished wood, plush furnishings, period lamps, heavy drapes, framed mirrors and lacy headrest covers. Staff members convert vintage cabins with banquette sofas with footstools into bedrooms with upper and lower berths while the passengers dine on their evening meal.\nBreakfast and afternoon tea are brought to guests in their cabins; French chefs prepare brunch, lunch and a four-course dinner in three white-tablecloth restaurant cars: Etoile du Nord, L’Oriental and Côte d’Azur. After dinner, passengers gather around the baby grand piano in the art nouveau bar car, an elegant spot for a nightcap.\nConductors welcome travelers aboard while wearing crisp blue uniforms with gold braid. Trips can be as short as London to Paris or as long as London to Istanbul by following various itineraries that may include the Alps and some great European cities: Venice, Berlin, Budapest, Vienna, Prague, Innsbruck and Bucharest.\nEastern & Oriental Express (E&O) With rich Asian decor, large windows, polished cherry wood and elm-burr paneling inlaid in intricate patterns, the E&O runs north and south along Southeast Asia’s Malay Peninsula — past palm trees, jungles, temples, rice fields, water buffalo, tiny villages and major cities. Departing from Bangkok, the train travels past the River Kwai, the beach-resort town of Hua Hin, Malaysia’s Penang and Kuala Lumpur and on to the city-state of Singapore.\nTo enhance views of the tropical scenery, one-third of the observation car — the last car on the train — is open to the outdoors. The indoor section creates an early 20th century plantation feeling with its teak floor, rattan chairs, wood-paneled walls and, for a bit of jungle inside, potted plants.\nTables in the rosewood-and-elm-paneled dining cars seat two to four guests for meals of Asian and European fare. Breakfast is served in guests’ cabins, but passengers may have afternoon tea anywhere on the train. The well-stocked bar car provides both a piano and pianist, and sometimes small groups of traditional dancers and musicians from local areas perform onboard.\nThe E&O has four types of cabins and suites, all decorated with Asian-inspired details covering every inch of the walls and creating cozy hideaways for those who want to spend their days ensconced in luxury cabins while gazing out picture windows at the countryside.\nFor a deeper look, passengers can disembark for a number of optional guided tours and further explore the wonders of Thailand, Laos, Malaysia or Singapore.\nAl Andalus Belle epoque beauty, dark wood paneling, damask draperies, flower-patterned window shades, antique-styled table lamps, red-striped and brocade furnishings — it all says richness and wealth. And it’s the real deal with the rail cars on Al Andalus: The restaurant, lounge and bar cars and five of the seven sleeper cars were built in 1929 and 1930 by one of France’s most well-known and respected carriage-makers, Wagons-Lits.\nThe carriages have been restored to the original style of nearly a century ago to give passengers a sense of that bygone era as they roll through the Andalusian areas of southern Spain, such as Seville, Cadiz, Ronda, Granada, Cordoba and Toledo as well as Madrid.\nThis multicultural area of Spain has been influenced in history, architecture, art, cuisine and lifestyle by Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Moors and Catholics. Passengers can choose different itineraries to explore Andalusia. April Orcutt, who lives in California, adores train travel.\nWhen you go Luxury Train Club has a list of nearly 40 private luxury trains (including the three in this story) in around 50 countries. Check website for discounts and special offers. luxurytrainclub.com\nGolden Eagle Luxury Trains has a list of five private trains with journeys primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia (Russia and China). goldeneagleluxurytrains.com\nPacking tip\nSimon Pielow, concierge of the Luxury Train Club, suggests: “Pack smartly: not too much, but quality, crease-resistant clothing. Although most luxury trains have extra space for storage, who wants to be lugging unnecessary baggage around? Remember good walking shoes — you’ll want to see the sights without sore feet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T01:32:03.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
