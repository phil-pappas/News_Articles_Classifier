It’s confronting to say the least.\nLet’s just say that I experienced a lot of firsts during one eye-opening week at The Yoga Forest — an organic, vegan, hippie, and self-sustaining yoga retreat perched on a hill overlooking the beautiful Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.\nNow, people like me usually don’t go to yoga retreats. Because I’m a true sceptic; I rarely believe in anything without being provided hard evidence first.\nAnd yoga seems to attract all sorts of fringe dwellers, from crystal healers to women who have conversations with your pet (for a fee of course). While I see the huge benefits; stress relief, blood circulation, looking hot in stretchy pants etc, I just don’t get why so many yoga-doers are, well, eccentric.\nI wanted to find out though, and my girlfriend Roxane was keen to do some yoga. So we set off for The Yoga Forest from the docks of San Marcos, a 10 minute boat ride from the more popular San Pedro.\nWe’d heard that the 30-minute uphill, unmarked hike would be difficult with large packs, so we hired two young lads to schlep our 20 kilogram bags and guide us.\nYep, there was a lot to carry. Source: Supplied\nWe eventually arrived at the top of a massive staircase. We were sweaty, thirsty and excited to immerse ourselves into a week of yoga, good food and mind cleansing. Niss, a wiry, frizzy-haired man with a calm disposition and a long stare, met us and showed us to our cabin.\nWow, this thing was incredible. Built from local materials, it overlooked the lake all the way to the smoking volcanoes in the distance.\nA cowbell rang to signal dinner so we headed to the dining hut — an al fresco compound complete with hammocks, colourful pillows, a communal table and camp-style kitchen. I sat down across from a dude called Joey and we started into the standard backpacker introductions.\nA delicious spread of vegan food (surprising to me) was laid out on a kitchen bench. We made a circle around it and there was awkward eye contact until Niss signalled for us to hold hands.\nI was ready to explore the yoga world. Source: Supplied\nA few words were said along the lines of thanks to the Earth, the powers that be, yadda yadda and then there was a group chant; Shanti, Shanti, Shaaaant- . It took a lot of effort for me to not burst into laughter.\nAfter learning that this ritual would take place before every meal, I lost my appetite.\nDarkness soon fell and I was motioned to follow a few guys over to the fire pit, which was tucked at the base of a huge cliff. A pine forest tumbled down the hillside below us with fireflies flickering between dark branches.\nI could see why they called this place magical.\nThe view. Wow! Source: Supplied\nRoughly 12 men were gathered around a roaring fire. I looked for an Esky but had no luck. A bonfire without beer was new for me — but whatever, I was here to try new things, right?\nWe took turns talking about our feelings. Firstly, what we were grateful for? I said something about being a privileged, rich guy being able to afford going to retreats like this. Two or three men laughed. Now I knew who my friends were and lines had been drawn in the sand.\nI awoke the next day smelling of campfire, marijuana and bewilderment. Birds were tweeting, mist was rising off the lake and I could hear the local workers conversing in Spanish nearby. I wanted to take some pictures, but my camera had died and there were no power sources we were allowed to use. Batteries were banned as well electronic devices; this was made clear during the booking process.\nSo I picked up my copy of Into The Wild and got comfy in a hammock, taking in my surroundings. Local labourers constantly flowed past me carrying humungous boulders on the back of their heads, they were attached with rope and the full weight rested on their foreheads.\nI couldn’t even lift these things off the ground, let alone do that! Tough work, but they take what they can get here. And The Yoga Forest needed a new shower block.\nPeople were hard at work here. Picture: A TripAdvisor traveller Source: Supplied\nThe next few days were spent doing a bit of yoga and getting into the routine. The only class I attended was Yin — basically chilling out, stretching and then having a little nap at the end. I liked it. Meanwhile the yoga devotees were up every day at 6am for meditation, and there was even an Acrobatic yoga session taught by Niss, who used to work as a circus performer.\nI became slightly annoyed halfway through the week because Yin kept getting cancelled for more complex training. You see, The Yoga Forest also has a yoga teacher training course and Permaculture certificate courses, so you almost feel as though you’re intruding on their learning missions.\nMy ADHD eventually got the best of me so a group of us snuck off into town for some fun. Wine, pizzas, meat, pasta and real conversations brought us all back to reality. A local dog befriended us and followed us back to retreat. He looked around, had a drink and headed back to town. Something must’ve smelled funny.\nThe dog was right. At lunch the next day less than half of the camp showed up for singsongs. Gastro had hit. Rox even got it and she never gets sick. Getting a stomach bug sucks at the best of times, getting it while travelling is worse. And getting it at The Yoga Forest is pure hell.\nEven Roxane, who has guts of steel, fell ill. Source: Supplied\nThe nearest toilet to our cabin was about 100m away and down roughly 50 unlit, perilous stone steps — and our cabin was one of the closest. I use the word “toilet” loosely — these were compost toilets. They are great in theory, but not when you have 20 sick campers, thousands of flies and with the only hand washing facilities consisting of a scummy sink and a bamboo container of ashes.\nYep, they make you wash yourself with ASHES — then you’ve got a whole bunch of can’t even-ing going on right there. So getting sick is pretty rough, but it happens; we’re in Guatemala right?\nWell it was strange, as we’d been in Central America for a few months already and hadn’t heard of a mini-epidemic like this. I’ve worked in restaurants before and know the drill on food safety.\nIt’s pretty simple: Wash your hands with soap (not ashes), don’t cross contaminate (everyone holding hands before digging into a self-serve meal is a food safety nightmare) and don’t let sick people touch anything that’s going to be consumed (the permaculture students take turns cooking meals).\nPeople left once the sickness hit. Source: Supplied\nThere was an exodus among some of the newer guests. A couple of Aussie girls were being shown to their shared dorm and walked in to see moaning figures in the darkness next to sick-filled bowls on the floor. Welcome to paradise! O .\nThen all of a sudden it was out last full day, and the weather became spectacular.\nLightning lit up the indigo skies and cracked on the volcanoes, while thunder boomed so loudly that the glass rattled. Afternoon yoga was on during the height of the storm and it provided background for an electric session.\nI felt great. Everyone was smiling. It was decided we would fire up the sauna.\nLightning lit up the sky. Source: Supplied\nA tiny granite structure that was tucked beside a gently flowing stream already had smoke billowing from its chimney. The fire was roaring and there was a slight chill in the air, I was really looking forward to a nice relaxing session. I swung the door open and peered into the darkness. A voice called out “Shut the door!”, it was Niss.\nI pulled the door shut behind me and waited for my eyes to adjust. I wish they hadn’t. Unfortunately my gaze was directed towards a naked crotch. I’m totally fine with male nudity — but surprise nudity is the worst kind of nudity.\nI was wearing board shorts and awkwardly wondering if I was disobeying a nude policy when the door swung open and three half clothed people tumbled in.\nAs the tiny sauna built for six eventually swelled to 14, we jostled for comfortable spots while trying not to graze anyone’s bare skin. Finally it seemed like everyone had found their seats and I closed my eyes to relax — then the singing started. A German girl led; belting out ridiculously high notes like it was an audition for a Frozen musical. This carried on for ages.\nNiss was in charge of the fire and water for steam. Without breaking chorus he would casually stand, crouching slightly, facing the rest of us who were sitting in a semicircle and spray the hot oven with a water bottle. Then he would use his wound up towel to make a helicopter motion to disperse steam around the room. Keep in mind he was buck-naked, and it wasn’t the only thing making a helicopter motion.\nEnough was enough, I bolted for the door and didn’t look back.\nThe sauna experience stressed me out — the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do. So I literally ran to the village and plonked myself at a bar to numb my emotions. I returned to our cabin that night, reasonably drunk and excited to move on the next day.\nIt was an interesting experience, that’s for sure. Source: Supplied\nI met a lot of fantastic humans during my week at The Yoga Forest. Some of them taught me some new things; some of them left me gasping for reason. It also proved to me that people could believe in anything if it makes them feel good.\nAt the end of my week I didn’t walk out of the forest as a holistic, dreadlocked Earth Child. I did however, lose 8kg and that’s a win.\n** news.com.au reached out to the Yoga Forest for comment about its health and safety standards, and this is what it had to say:\n“The Yoga Forest maintains health and safety standards as is suitable for an off-the-grid, permaculture farm, where natural soaps as well as ashes (which is the base material of soap — this is what lye is made from) are offered for hand washing. We do not introduce chemicals unless absolutely necessary, such as disinfecting communal areas and bathrooms in the event of guest illness or other sanitation issues.\n“People fall sick in general in Guatemala at the start of the rainy season and this is nothing in particular to do with our establishment, but is a yearly ‘Mal de Mayo’ phenomenon which is well understood as part of the seasonal changes in this country, however, tourists without knowledge assume the worst of each pace they visit without doubt.\n“As a spiritual community we bless food together holding hands, and encourage people to then wash their hands prior to eating.\n“As we work with very conservative Mayan families within our staff, we do not encourage nudity at any time in public spaces. If people wish to get nude inside the sauna that is their prerogative, and is not something we feel is necessary to enforce.”\nIncrease ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/australians-venture-into-the-yoga-forest-in-guatemala-have-a-strange-experience/story-fnjpja3r-1227461662808?sv=7ff47d95f981d348f2888b7d32a66c0e&title=%26%238216%3BYep%2C+they+make+you+wash+yourself+with+ashes%26%238217%3B", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/australians-venture-into-the-yoga-forest-in-guatemala-have-a-strange-experience/story-fnjpja3r-1227461662808?sv=7ff47d95f981d348f2888b7d32a66c0e&h=%26%238216%3BYep%2C+they+make+you+wash+yourself+with+ashes%26%238217%3B", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/australians-venture-into-the-yoga-forest-in-guatemala-have-a-strange-experience/story-fnjpja3r-1227461662808?sv=7ff47d95f981d348f2888b7d32a66c0e", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/australians-venture-into-the-yoga-forest-in-guatemala-have-a-strange-experience/story-fnjpja3r-1227461662808?sv=7ff47d95f981d348f2888b7d32a66c0e&title=%26%238216%3BYep%2C+they+make+you+wash+yourself+with+ashes%26%238217%3B", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/australians-venture-into-the-yoga-forest-in-guatemala-have-a-strange-experience/story-fnjpja3r-1227461662808?sv=7ff47d95f981d348f2888b7d32a66c0e", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=%26%238216%3BYep%2C+they+make+you+wash+yourself+with+ashes%26%238217%3B&c=WHEN+this+Australian+couple+ventured+into+a+remote+yoga+retreat+in+Guatemala%2C+little+could+they+have+realised+what+it+had+in+store+for+them.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/australians-venture-into-the-yoga-forest-in-guatemala-have-a-strange-experience/story-fnjpja3r-1227461662808?sv=7ff47d95f981d348f2888b7d32a66c0e"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T07:12:20.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
