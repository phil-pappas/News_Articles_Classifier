A little gawky, a little loud, but up for anything because they were together. They were one. They were Girl Scout Troop 1718 of the Eastside.\nTwenty years later, they are accomplished, educated women with well-punched passports and 30-year mortgages. Two are librarians. One is a lawyer. Another a public-relations account director and another a government analyst. Three stayed local, while three moved away to Portland, Phoenix and Washington, D.C.\nThey were back at River Ranch for Glamp 2014, a fundraising weekend sponsored by the Girl Scouts of Western Washington that invited anyone who had been a Girl Scout — or wished she had been — to spend the weekend in Carnation, doing what Scouts do, with the addition of massages and a fancy dinner with wine. Lots of wine.\n(This year, Glamp will be Sept. 11-13. Cost is $260 and includes four meals, including dinner prepared by chef Maria Hines).\nMost Read Stories Man shot dead in South Seattle while on phone with mom Seattle company copes with backlash on $70,000 minimum wage Impressions from Day 2 of Seahawks' training camp Seahawks sign four-year extension with linebacker Bobby Wagner worth a reported $43 million Higher wages a surprising success for Seattle restaurant Ivar's Kari Fugitt, 37, who lives in Washington, D.C., had read about Glamp online and reached out to everyone through Facebook. The group hadn’t been all together since high-school graduation.\n“I feel like sending Mark Zuckerberg a thank-you note,” said Erin Ostrander, 36, a children’s librarian for the King County Library System who lives in Seattle.\n“I thought it was ingenious,” Chrissy Vaughn, 36, said of using Glamp to reunite with her troopmates, who included Tami Wilkerson, 36, of Portland, and Sarah Monson, 37, who just moved to Kirkland.\nOn Glamp weekend, the once-gawky grade-schoolers were now the cool girls who could roam blindfolded. They knew every shortcut. The quiet places. How to get in and out of a canoe and the best site for setting up a tent.\nAt the opening ceremony, when Glampers gathered in a circle and were being led through a song, Alina Morris, 36, and now a lawyer living in Seattle, started singing almost uncontrollably.\n“The lyrics were just spilling out,” she said. “I thought, ‘How did I remember this?’ The songs were in the dark recesses of my mind.”\nVaughn, the public-relations account director, took in the sight of her former troopmates standing together again and teared up.\n“I had chills,” she said. “There are certain people in your life that you don’t see in 15 years, and it just feels like yesterday.”\nOstrander agreed: “This group of women knew me when I was in fifth grade and awkward.”\n“No time had passed,” Morris added. “And the connection is just as strong.”\nOver the weekend, each woman fell into her old role. Vaughn’s competitiveness came out on the archery range; Ostrander was the nurturer and Morris, ever-soulful.\nAfter the big campfire on Saturday night, the friends walked out to the dock and circled up like they always had.\n“We were helping one of us with a boy problem,” Morris said “There was tough love, there were tears, and there was the taking away of a cellphone.”\nTheir dynamic hadn’t changed, nor had the things they had learned together as Girl Scouts. They had all grown to be leaders, self-reliant and involved with their communities.\n“The activities you’re able to do, the skills you gain,” Ostrander said, “It’s not something that you grow out of.”\nShe sings every day, as she did as a Scout. She loves to cook, as she did as a Scout.\nAnd long before a recent New Yorker article put the fear of the Big One in Seattle’s psyche and sent the preparedness industry ablaze, Ostrander had an emergency box in her car, complete with food, water, shoes and a book of crossword puzzles.\nShe also developed a passion for mentoring and working with kids, which led to her getting her library-sciences degree from the University of Washington.\nVaughn is the planner.\n“I try to anticipate everything,” she said. “My nickname is Mary Poppins because I’m always pulling things out of my bag. I have everything.”\nShe also grew up to be a soccer coach at Redmond High School, a role she was drawn to after mentoring younger Scouts. And she served on the board of IGNITE, a nonprofit that connects girls to the science and technology fields.\nMorris credits the Girl Scouts with teaching her to adapt to new situations and networking.\n“How to be inclusive and to connect, and to have empathy,” she said. “I have all these skills that came from being a Girl Scout.”\nShe’s also pretty good with a knife.\n“I always end up chopping all the fruit and vegetables,” she said. “I’m food prep.”\nThat came in handy on the day the group returned from Glamp and hosted a potluck for their parents as a gesture of thanks.\nNow that they were older, Ostrander said, “We realized all they had done. Sleeping in tents on mats, driving all over.”\nAre they still the same?\n“Who is?” Morris cracked, then thought for a moment. “When you’re a kid, you’re just trying to make your way and get along and not hate life. And 20 years later, you realize how special that was.”\nSaid Vaughn: “We all grow as adults, but I can still see the elements of our personalities from when we were kids.\n“We’re just better versions of ourselves.”", "external_links": ["https://www.girlscoutsww.org/who-we-are/girl-scouts-news/pages/save-the-date-for-glamp-weekend!-.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-31T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T19:03:32.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
