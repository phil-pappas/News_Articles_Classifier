The route began flying in 2009 and has so far carried 95,000 passengers in 2015, according to Haaretz. But airline officials said it was still not profitable.\nIsraeli Transportation Ministry Director General Uzi Itzhaki has asked the Foreign Ministry to contact the U.S. government so as to help retain the flights. But Itzhaki acknowledged that because American is a private company, the government has limited leverage.\n“We acknowledge that this involves a private airline, but shutting down the route would impair the level of service and increase ticket prices,” Itzhaki said, according to Haaretz.\nThe Foreign Ministry has said it will look into the matter.\nAmerican Airlines told JTA:\n“Over the last year, the route lost more than $20 million,” Casey Norton, the airline’s director of corporate communications, told JTA in an email of the Philadelphia-Tel Aviv flight. “In fact, the route has not made an annual profit since it was started in 2009.\n“Some international routes require an investment of resources until they stabilize and begin to demonstrate growth, but the revenue demand for our flights to Tel Aviv could never overcome the substantial costs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T22:27:18.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
