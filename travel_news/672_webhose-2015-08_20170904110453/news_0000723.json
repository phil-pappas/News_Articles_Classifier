All figures were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Brazilian real / US dollar average exchange rate for the quarter was BRL 3.07 per USD.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n· The second quarter of 2015 marks the third anniversary of the association between LAN and TAM, a historic milestone for our companies and a strategic decision that placed us at the forefront of the aviation industry in Latin America. With significant achievements during this year, including cost efficiencies on multiple fronts, the negotiation of our Passenger Service System and the announcement of our new unified brand, we continue to make progress towards our long term objective of consolidating LATAM’s leadership position within the region. However, we have not been immune to the challenging macroeconomic conditions that have affected South American economies, especially Brazil, and which have led us to make certain adjustments. These adjustments, including capacity reductions in the Brazilian domestic market, are a necessary response to the current challenges but in no way alter our long term strategic plans. We firmly believe that, with the best and most diversified network, LATAM Airlines Group is the best positioned airline to respond to a weaker macroeconomic scenario in South America, a position we continue to strengthen through cost efficiencies, enhancement of our key hubs and consistently providing the best experience to our passengers.\n· LATAM Airlines Group reported operating income of US$17.2 million with an operating margin of 0.7% for second quarter 2015, an increase of 0.2 percentage points as compared to the second quarter 2014. This result was driven by a strong 20.7% reduction in the Company’s cost per ASK equivalent, including the effect of lower fuel prices. Excluding fuel, cost per ASK equivalent decreased by 13.8%, reflecting efficiencies related to our already announced cost savings plan, as well as the effect of local currency depreciations on our costs denominated in those currencies.\n· Total revenues during the second quarter 2015 declined by 20.8%, reflecting a weak macroeconomic environment in Brazil and significant devaluations of Latin American currencies. The challenging economic scenario in Brazil, caused by an increase in inflation, GDP decline -estimated between 1.5% to 2.0% for 2015- and a significant depreciation of the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar, has resulted in a slowdown in demand for domestic and international passenger operations, as well as cargo operations.\n· Passenger and cargo demand in all of the Group’s operations outside of Brazil, including its affiliates domestic operations in the Spanish Speaking Countries and international operations throughout LATAM’s network outside of Brazil, has generally proved resilient to local currency devaluations. As a result, and in addition to cost efficiencies, profitability in all these operations shows positive trends as compared to 2014.\n· Considering the impact of the current economic scenario in Brazil, TAM is adjusting its domestic network and reducing domestic capacity by approximately 8% to 10% by year-end. As a result, the Company has revised its capacity (ASK) growth for this year for the domestic market in Brazil from 0% growth to a contraction of 2 to 4% as compared to 2014. This adjustment in no the way affects the Company’s long-term strategy, which includes the feasibility study for the Northeastern hub and the continuous strengthening of our hubs in Brasília and São Paulo/Guarulhos.\n· Furthermore, LATAM Airlines Group is reviewing its fleet plan and fleet requirements for the coming years, and is currently evaluating whether to postpone a number of wide body passenger aircraft currently scheduled for delivery in 2017 and 2018, as well as to sublease at least one freighter aircraft.\nSource:-LATAM Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:03:41.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
