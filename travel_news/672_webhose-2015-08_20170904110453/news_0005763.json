Most users have no desire to use three separate sites or apps for booking a car rental, flight and hotel stay, meaning that it is most optimal for booking brands to offer cohesive, all-in-one package deals. \nUsers on Orbitz’s app may now search and book thousands of hotel and flight vacation packages with the tap of a finger. The app displays packages with the best value, so that customers visiting a single location may receive all necessary travel information at once. \nConsumers are prompted to save more by booking flights and hotels at the same time \nGuests may also customize their package to include their preferred room type and flight, as well as indicate if they are interested in changing hotels during the vacation. Before a purchase is completed, Orbitz will show the user how much he or she saved by booking the flight and hotel simultaneously. \nThe vacation package feature is currently live on Orbitz’s Android app, and will be available on the iOS version later this month. \nMobile’s influence on travel Orbitz claims it has experienced a 100 percent uptick in vacation package bookings made via smartphones on its mobile site, prompting the brand to introduce the feature for app users. Travel enthusiasts are no longer relying on mobile solely for research purposes; instead, they are completing purchases while on-the-go with increasing fervor. \nAs the number of last-minute booking apps grows, travel marketers will need to adopt newer technologies such as Apple Pay and Touch ID to offer streamlined in-app payment options and remain competitive ( see story ). \nOrbitz customers spend nearly $1,700 on vacation packages, on average, while booking up to two months in advance. \nTotal savings are displayed to prove the value of vacation packages to users \nThe marketer would be well-suited to offer initial incentives to fuel more new customers to purchase vacation packages within the app. \n“Orbitz should run campaigns in parallel with this announcement that will offer package deals to get consumers to login from their handheld and try the new features, in order for them to experience the ease of use and speedy return times for information and booking, which are phenomenal,” Ms. Troutman said. \nFinal Take Alex Samuely is an editorial assistant on Mobile Commerce Daily, New York Alex Samuely   Daily,   alex@mobilemarketer.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:22:19.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
