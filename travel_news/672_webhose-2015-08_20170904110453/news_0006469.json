At some point, he figures, either the airlines will run out of things to charge for, or passengers will run out of things they’re willing to pay for. But for him, that time has already come. He refuses to fly Frontier no matter how low the fare. \nHave we reached the limit? Maybe. \nFrontier recently caved in to customers such as Foley who had been complaining about its abundant fees. In August, it began bundling several extras, including one checked bag, one carry-on, the “best available” seat and no fee for changing the ticket later, into a package it calls “the Works.” \nBut that doesn’t mean airlines have stopped pushing. One reason: Passengers keep buying low fares, although they often do so with unrealistic expectations. \n“Most travelers take the cheapest fares and are then disappointed when they do the traveling,” says Spencer Carlson, who runs a travel company in Kansas City, Mo. “But some airlines are figuring out this threshold.” \nFor example, Norwegian Air, a low-cost European carrier, offers one-way tickets from New York to Oslo at about $180 but has still figured out how to exceed expectations. Yes, it was extra for luggage, but Norwegian didn’t charge for in-flight movies, the food was good and the seats were comfortable, Carlson says. “I was blown away at the professionalism of the staff and the cleanliness of the aircraft. The overall experience was fantastic.” \nNorwegian is an interesting example, because American carriers have been trying to stop it from operating in the United States. The reason? Instead of cutting back service, Norwegian found creative ways around high labor costs. Instead of using European or American flight crews, for example, it reportedly hires Bangkok-based crews through a Singapore employment agency who are governed by Singapore labor law. \nSeems the question isn’t whether airlines have gone too far. They have, and they know it. It’s more a question of which direction they’ve done it in. In an effort to eke out a little extra profit, are they more willing to anger their customers or their employees? \nEither way, one thing is certain: They probably don’t have far to go before we’re at our breaking point. \nChristopher Elliott's latest book is \"How To Be The World’s Smartest Traveler\" (National Geographic).
