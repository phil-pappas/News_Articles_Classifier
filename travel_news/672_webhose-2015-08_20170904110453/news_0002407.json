The long wait, the nerves, the sense of impending doom – it all revolves around their big day. But for some parents, the day can be equally stressful. For these so-called 'grown-ups', Results Day often brings out their true colours. From the 'Loud and Proud' to the 'Silent but Smug' – these parents can be just as bad as the students . Here are the 10 types of parents you'll see on Results Day this year. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android The 'Helicopter' This parent will be hovering over your shoulder standing in an intense silence as you slowly open your results, beads of sweat rolling down their face. Throughout the last three months they’ll have been bombarding you with question after question: \"Why aren’t you revising?\", \"How many hours have you done today?\", \"What marks have you been getting in your practice papers?\" For those students who unfortunately fail to meet their expected grades, this parent can usually be found wearing a look of sheer despair and bewilderment. But for those who have managed to secure their first or second choice, the advent of university couldn’t come sooner … The 'Loud and proud' Having seen their teenager's excellent results, all social decorum is temporarily discarded as these parents erupt into ecstasy. Expect deafening shrieks, a dangerous number of hugs and tears of pure happiness. The parent is then likely to proceed to thank each and every teacher for their wonderful contribution to their child’s education. For particularly confident ‘Loud and prouds’, pre-bought bottles of wine or caviar may be presented as thank you gifts. If you know your parent is likely to react like this, make sure you open your results out of harms way. Proud parents will be equally keen to join in with photos Photo: SWNS The 'Competitor' As you’re nervously opening your results and contemplating your university future, you’ll suddenly notice a figure out of the corner of your eye lurking in the shadows. This is the ‘Competitor’. They’ll usually be accompanied by their equally competitive child, as the two prowl about the school lobby trying to catch a glimpse of your results. To avoid this irksome sleuth, we recommend standing within the vicinity of the ‘Loud and Proud’ parent to scare off any wandering eyes. The ' Inquisitor' The distant cousin of the ‘Competitor’, this parent will employ slightly more subtle tactics when attempting to find out other teens' results. Expect to be met with comments such as “I hope you did well!”, “Your mum said she’s really proud of your results”, “I heard you did particularly well …” Be warned though, these are all shrewd attempts to get you to reveal your results. Watch what you say in their presence. The 'I’m too nervous – I’ll wait in the car' Pretty self-explanatory. Many parents won't be able to handle the nerves on Results Day Photo: Alamy The ' Silent but smug' This sort can be spotted a mile off, from the smug expression that they’re not trying that hard to hide. Grinning from ear to ear, this parent won’t be saying anything but will be standing - with their chest puffed out - as if they’re the ones with four A*s. Any attempts at conversation will be strained as this parent refuses to give much away, but it’ll be more than obvious to everyone that their student has done well. The ' There must have been a mistake' Again, for those students who miss out on their grades these parents can be particularly embarrassing. Mum and Dad can usually be found engaged in a heated conversation with the head of year asking for some explanation with regards to their child’s results. Their favourite catchphrases include (but are not limited to): “There must have been a mistake!”, “We demand an immediate remark!”, “What do you mean my child hasn’t go in?” For the poor teacher who’s left to deal with them there’s sadly not much that can be done – a cup of tea may go some way to calming them down but we wouldn’t bet on it. The 'Stay at home, wait by the phone' At your request, this parent will have thankfully stayed at home while you get your results. They’ll have pestered you on countless occasions to ring when you finally get the results – something you’re likely to forget as you head down to the pub for a celebratory pint of lemonade … obviously. Try not to keep expectant parents waiting too long for Results Day news Photo: Alamy The 'Blissfully unaware' For a lucky few, this parent will have spent the last three months in relative ignorance of the whole GCSE/A-levels process. They’ll have shown some awareness of your school “tests” but won’t have extensively interrogated you over them. On the day of your results, these parents may be slightly more mindful as to what’s going on – and may even accompany you to school – but their general lack of understanding will fortunately spare you the embarrassment that other students are cruelly subjected to. The 'We’re proud of you no matter what' You can rest assured that, no matter what your results, these parents will be proud of you. While encouraging you to work hard throughout the revision period, they won’t have pressured you like the ‘Helicopter’ parent. As for the big day, it will be all about you and how you’ve done. Expect a comforting embrace if things don’t go your way and heaps of praise if they do.
