He asks: What does the Northern Powerhouse mean for SMEs in the region? Business writer Hazel Davis replies: The controversial Northern Powerhouse proposal is a scheme to boost economic growth in the North, specifically in the core cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. An interim mayor – Tony Lloyd – is in place in Greater Manchester, whose 10 councils currently control about £5bn of public money each year. The new deal is expected to allow them a further £2bn. It is hoped this will become the blueprint for other cities, such as Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds. Though the proposal isn’t without its critics, the general consensus is that with greater power and better transport between the Northern cities, SMEs would be able to collaborate more effectively and access local markets more easily. A study earlier this year from eBay, which looked at Britain’s most active regions for web-based SMEs, found Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire in the top three, despite their lower GDP per capita. So there’s no shortage of business talent in the regions. It’s also hard to ignore the fact that, in the main, the cost of living is lower. This year’s Lloyds Bank Affordable Cities Review placed Bradford, Salford, Durham and Lancaster in the top 10. Unsurprisingly, cities in the South East and South West came out bottom. So perhaps we’ll see some of London’s 800,00+ SMEs relocating from London to the North, if improved economic plans are enacted alongside an increase in graduates less willing to flee to London. This is excellent news for start-ups. Ed Cox, who leads the Institute of Public Policy Research’s dedicated thinktank for the North of England (IPPR North), adds: The Northern Powerhouse represents a huge opportunity for small businesses. For too long, top-down decision-making by central government has meant local economies have been unable to nurture the skills needed for local businesses to thrive; business support has come in the form of clunky national schemes; and vital transport investment has been skewed towards London and the South East. Although it is still in its early days, there is a growing momentum behind Northern cities, which is founded upon the endeavour and entrepreneurial spirit of its small business base. Some may fear the prospects of greater fiscal devolution, but today's combined authorities are a far cry from the loony councils of the past and businesses need to support initiatives of this emerging group of city leaders as they restore our northern cities to their former glories on the global stage. At present, skills training is largely commissioned by central government paying colleges for bums on seats, irrespective of the courses offered. Devolved skills systems enable skills providers to work more closely with employers to ensure courses offered feed directly into local labour needs. • Wherever you’re based in the UK, the right company car, financed in the best way, makes good business sense.
