They want to destroy our economy, our tourism.” \nThe UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice following the attack. \n“The British Embassy is in contact with local authorities. You should monitor news reports, follow the advice of local authorities and take extra care,” it said. \nAs well as the 22 casualties, there are more than 120 injured people. \nIn a statement on its website the Tourism Authority of Thailand said: “The Royal Thai Police have requested that locals and tourists exercise caution when out and about in Bangkok. \n“The police have also increased their presence and put extra security in place at all of Bangkok’s key tourist areas in response to the incident.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:21:51.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
