A Nebraska real estate investment trust plans to acquire an Atlanta hotel as it aims to boost the quality of its portfolio. Condor Hospitality Trust Inc. (NASDAQ: CDOR), formerly Supertel Hospitality Inc. , has a deal to buy the Hotel Indigo near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The company in July entered into an agreement with Atlanta-based Peachtree Hotel Group for the 142-key Hotel Indigo Atlanta Airport College Park as part of a three-hotel deal that totals $42.5 million. The transaction is expected to close in third-quarter 2015. It would be Condor’s only hotel in metro Atlanta, after selling off its Savannah Suites in Chamblee earlier this year for $4.4 million. The company currently owns 46 hotels in 19 states, including two hotels in Savannah, according to its website. It also sold a Savannah Suites in Augusta earlier this year for $3.4 million. Condor, which just switched its name in July, is looking to acquire \"higher quality\" properties, its CEO has said. Hotel Indigo is a lifestyle brand from InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (NYSE:IHG) that launched in Atlanta. “Condor is in a state of transition, divesting older properties in the economy segment and investing in newer, contemporary hotels to create a significantly larger hospitality REIT comprised of a higher quality portfolio with greater margins and located in markets with better fundamentals,” Bill Blackham, Condor’s CEO, said in an announcement in July. “We will remain highly disciplined in our acquisition investment strategy, continuously review our portfolio and, when appropriate, upgrade into properties that we believe will generate more attractive returns. Brand considerations will be important in our portfolio because brand relevancy is critical to meeting evolving guest preferences, particularly the increasingly important Millennial generation.” The Hotel Indigo was built in 2012 at 1776 Harvard Avenue in College Park. It features 2,100 square feet of meeting space and the Harvard & Main restaurant. \nGet Atlanta  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:27:28.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
