Source: Snapper Media \nPLANE journeys can be stressful experiences, so we’re not always on our best behaviour. \nBut if you’re a celebrity, you had better be careful, because cabin crew are revealing exactly what they think about you on the Professional Pilots Rumour Network. \nAustralia’s pop icons acquitted themselves well, with Kylie praised as simply “lovely” (and beautiful), Voice coach Delta Goodrem proving happy to chat with pilots over a cup of tea and Natalie Imbruglia deemed “friendly and gorgeous”. \nPrince William was described as down-to-earth and “amusing”, and wife Kate was also “low-key”. \nMadonna, on the other hand, is called “precious” and accused of “throwing her toys out”, while one user labelled Helen Mirren “vile”, saying she “thought she was the queen.” \nThey were among a host of celebs who attracted criticism for their condescending behaviour, while politeness and courtesy clearly go a long way. \nCeline Dion allegedly had a “terrible attitude”, while Cilla Black was widely criticised for only speaking to airline staff through a personal assistant. Robbie Williams was mocked as “cocky”, although others said he was a hit with the ladies. Madonna was labelled “precious”. Source: AP Delta Goodrem is polite and happy to chat. Source: Getty Images \nStephen Fry was applauded as “charming and unassuming”, Hugh Grant was “a thoroughly nice chap” and football manager Alex Ferguson always thanked staff. \nBeyonce was unsurprisingly “cool, calm and collected”, with Cate Blanchett also showing poise in taking care of her children in-flight. Rihanna, on the other hand, was branded “spoiled”. \nVictoria Beckham was a divisive passenger, with some naming her and husband David Beckham as among the nicest celebrities while others thought her “miserable and rude.” \nHer fellow Spice Girls were less popular, with Geri Halliwell dismissed as “abrupt” and Mel B given a familiar label — scary. \nPamela Anderson was “sweet”, Joan Rivers “on another planet” and Naomi Campbell “surly”. \nThe fascinating thread also contains some brilliant anecdotes about well-known figures. George Michael is apparently a big fan of plane food, asking for second helpings, while Guy Sebastian took time to go to the back of a flight and talk to four unaccompanied children, helping with their colouring-in. Kate Middleton was “low-key” and Prince William “amusing”. Source: AFP \nMargaret Thatcher, famous for only needing five hours sleep a night, would apparently appear on the flight deck at midnight in her dressing gown with a tray of hot chocolate for everyone. \nCelebrities who were friendly with cabin crew came in for plenty of praise. Russell Crowe apparently took the time for a chat and “threw a few bags on to the barrows”, while Kate Hudson and Sean Connery both made conversation and joked with flight attendants during flights. \nConversely, Whitney Houston’s pilots were apparently told that at no time during the week’s charter were they to make eye contact with her or try to speak to her. \nIt’s an eye-opening look at how celebrities behave when they’re stuck in a pressurised environment, along with all the rest of us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T08:59:05.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
