But I checked with the Civil Aviation Authority, and people on the ground in Reunion, and it was just a domestic ladder.” \nMeanwhile, the Agence France-Presse news agency said on Sunday that one of its photographers had also seen a mangled piece of metal inscribed with two Chinese characters, attached to a leather-covered handle and measuring 100 sq cm, which was placed into an iron case and carried away. \nSome social media commentators have suggested it might be a kettle. \nA source close to the inquiry told AFP that “no object or debris likely to come from a plane” had been submitted as evidence on Sunday. \nA spokesperson in the town of St Andre said that while people were more vigilant, “they are going to think any metallic object they find on the beach is from flight MH370”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T02:46:55.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
