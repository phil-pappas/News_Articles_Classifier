Her daughter lost her home in nearby Waveland. Many of her friends and neighbors suffered similarly.\nMichaela Harrison sings a gospel hymn at a wreath laying ceremony at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial, on the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015.

I didn't go through what all the other people did.\"\nIn Biloxi, clergy and community leaders were to gather later at MGM Park for a memorial to Katrina's victims and later that evening the park will host a concert celebrating the recovery.\nThe hurricane 's force and flooding ultimately caused more than 1,800 deaths and roughly $151 billion in damage across the region. In New Orleans, wide scale failures of the levee system protecting the city left 80 percent of New Orleans under water.\nMusicians lead the procession during a wreath laying ceremony at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial, on the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Katrina's force caused a massive storm surge that scoured the Mississippi coast, pushed boats far inland and wiped houses off the map, leaving only concrete front steps to nowhere.\nGlitzy casinos and condominium towers have been rebuilt. But overgrown lots and empty slabs speak to the slow recovery in some communities.\nIn the evening, former President Bill Clinton will headline a free concert-prayer service-celebration at the city's Smoothie King Center. In addition to the former president the event will feature performances by the city's \"Rebirth Brass Band,\" award-winning journalist Soledad O'Brien and Chief Monk Boudreaux and the Wild Magnolias.\nCameron Clark, right, and Aaron Covin, second left, bow during the invocation at a wreath laying ceremony at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial, on the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The city has framed the 10th anniversary as a showcase designed to demonstrate to the world how far the city has come. In a series of events in the week leading up to the actual anniversary, the city has held lectures, given tours of the levee improvements and released a resiliency plan.\nMany parts of this iconic city have rebounded phenomenally while many residents — particularly in the city's black community — still struggle.\nMusicians lead the procession during a wreath laying ceremony at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial, on the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015.
