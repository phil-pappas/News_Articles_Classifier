Port Columbus International Airport has opened a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection clearance facility, which officials expect will heighten the city’s stature among business travelers for quickening the process for entering the country. The Lane Aviation building, opened this week, allows passengers on private jets to bypass a customs checkpoint for commercial travelers and save up to several hours, said Mark Myers , a Lane Aviation vice president. Lane Aviation, a Columbus-based fixed-base operator, hopes to increase annual clearances to 400 from 250. Stephen Lyons , executive vice president of the Columbus Partnership, lauded the $900,000, 2,667-square-foot facility. “Streamlining the customs clearance process enhances Columbus’ global reputation as an attractive city in which to conduct business,” Lyons said in a press release. Myers said Tim Hortons Inc. and Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE:SMG) are among users of the new facility. The existing U.S. Customs facility inside the Port Columbus terminal will continue serving commercial passengers. \nWant Columbus Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
