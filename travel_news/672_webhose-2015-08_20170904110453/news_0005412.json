Having one of the most beautiful sights in Seychelles, which is the sooty tern colony, the island’s management team has decided to invest in the sustainable practices at the Bird island Lodge, which is the tourism establishment on the island. For over a year now, the Bird Island Limited Company under the leadership of Guy Savy has made a new leap forward by investing in a small recycling-plant on the island, not far from where the hotel is situated. Glass, metals, aluminium and plastic materials are all recycled there. Prior to installing these crushers, these waste materials were sent to Mahé in bulk. The empty cans and tins from the hotel, and from the workers’ homes are now crushed and sent to Mahé every two to three months. \nSuch practices in tourism establishments are highly encouraged by the tourism authorities in the country. Other ways of contributing towards keeping the island clean, is the use of natural ventilation in the rooms at the hotel. The rooms do not have air-condition, but the clients do not miss it as the cool breeze from the vast turquoise sea replaces it perfectly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T11:37:20.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
