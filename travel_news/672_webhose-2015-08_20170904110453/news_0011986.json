This is usually the time that writers and travel pros head to beach parties or hotel bars with heavy duty air conditioning… so – it was absolutely amazing to find hundreds of people at an eastside townhouse event standing around at 5 PM sweating (or perspiring or glistening) in a space the size of a quarter – absolutely happy and laughing (I did not hear one complaint or groan about the heat). What turned this group into happy campers? Freely flowing Taittinger Champagne! \nTasting Turns Into a Party \nSo – in spite of the weather and non-functioning a/c – the Taittinger occasion was quite ingenious. Promoted as the Art of Celebrating the Holidays, a beautiful dining table was elegantly laid – with a split of Taittinger at each place setting. I understand that newest trend is to bring along a few 6-packs of Taittinger splits for kayak parties so hosts do not have to deal with large bottles and glasses. Never underestimate the importance of convenience. \nTaittinger is one of the last family –owned and operated Grand Marque Champagne houses and it their sense of elegance and good-taste that is being introduced to the hoi polloi. A visit to a wine shop for a bottle of champagne and the immediate brand that comes to mind is likely to be Moet & Chandon (Ranked #1 by industry publication The Drinks Business in 2013), followed by Veuve Clicquot, Nicolas Feuillatte, G.H. Mumm, or Laurent-Perrier. Taittinger comes in #6 in the ranking followed by Piper-Heidsieck (#7), Pommery (#8), Lanson (#9) and Canard-Duchene (#10). \nMood Elevating \nSipping Taittinger champagne definitely takes the edge off a bad temper and lowers the level of discomfort brought on by a large crowd in a small space with inadequate (or no) air-conditioning. \nIt is possible that if we all go out and buy Taittinger for hot weather and cold holidays – we can help move the brand from 6th to 1st place. \nNot only does this bubbly taste good (details in a minute) the Taittinger price is not outrageous. The non-vintage NV Brut La Francaise retails at approximately $60.00 per bottle and the Prestige Rose NV comes in at $84; however, the Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, 2005 at $170 may put a wee dent in a budget. \nNow the Tasting Details \nTaittinger Brut La Francaise NV. 40 percent Chardonnay; 35 percent pinot Noir, 25 percent Pinot Meuier (from 35 different crus over several harvests). Aged 3-4 years in the cellar. The fruit is manually harvested and pressed in the vineyard. The must is cold fermented under temperature-controlled conditions. At the end of the winter the wine is blended and the final cuvee is in the bottle. The aging on the lees for almost 4 years more than doubles the legal minimum of 15 months. \nPalest of lime edged blonde to the eye with a refreshing and unexpected citrus-note lends interest to a strikingly buoyant effervescent sensation on the tongue and palate. Suggestions of honeysuckle and mint line-up next to honeydew melon and apples. A delicious mix of sweetness that is more suggestive than dominant. Leaves the palate clear and clean but with a desire for more. Serve with a salmon quiche or a risotto. \nTaittinger Prestige Rose NV. 50 percent Pinot Noir, 30 percent Chardonnay, 20 percent Pinot Meunier. \nTo the eye there is a coral/fresh-water salmon cast to the light “sweet-sixteen” hue. To the nose a hint of cherry – more tantalizing than a blatant statement – lends intrigue to the very first sip. Think fresh raspberries and strawberries offset by a subtle hint of earthiness and acidity. Light and frothy on the tongue which quickly passes to a delicious nuance of light cherry. The sweetness is a delicate as a blossoming rose leaving the palate fresh, clear and refreshed. Enjoy as an aperitif, with oysters or fruit tarts. \nTaittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs 2005. Blend of Chardonnay grapes chosen from the very best Grands Crus in Cote des Blancs. Produced in small refined portions. \nThe palest of golden yellow to the eye and hints of citrus, lime blossoms and caramelized grapefruit to the nose. Suggestions of pears and melons tempered by ginger and smoky minerals combined with a slight effervescent experience to the palate makes this a very sensuous taste experience. Its intensity and a richness pairs it perfectly with seafood and shellfish or blinis and smoked salmon. \nThe Brand Equals Love \nLeading the Taittinger brand is Pierre-Emmanuel (born 1953) the grandson of the founder, who leads the organization with his daughter Vitalie and son Clovis. Taittinger is member of the consultative committee of the Banque de France and its diversified holdings include Champagne Taittinger, Societe du Louvre and Concorde Hotels – the flagship property is the Hotel de Crillon on the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. \nTaittinger is noted as commenting, \"Of course Champagne is a wine but let us not forget it is also a symbol—a symbol of love, success, celebration and enthusiasm. We should not avoid its magic; this is the soul of Champagne.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T03:47:57.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
