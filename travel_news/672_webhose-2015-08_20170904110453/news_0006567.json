(AP) -- A major renovation is beginning next month at Myrtle Beach's Springmaid Beach Resort which opened more than 60 years ago. Local media outlets report the 30-acre resort next to Springmaid Pier was sold in December for $40 million. As part of the makeover, the 450 guest rooms will be renovated and a 1950s'-era eatery will be replaced with a new oceanfront restaurant, bar and outdoor courtyard. Once the renovation is finished the resort, which also includes a conference center and camping facility, will be rebranded by its new owners as a DoubleTree by Hilton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T21:17:59.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
