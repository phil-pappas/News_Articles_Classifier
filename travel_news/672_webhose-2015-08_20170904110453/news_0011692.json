It began on Sept. 7, when 348 German bombers and 617 Messerschmitt fighters appeared in the clear skies above the British capital and began to pound the area with explosives. In the months that followed, great numbers of aghast Londoners fled to the countryside. But many more stayed put, through air raids that flattened great swaths of the city and killed 20,000 residents. When the bomb shelters filled up, tens of thousands of Londoners filed into Underground stations, where they slept, packed like sardines, on the concrete platforms. This September marks the 75th anniversary of the Blitz (short for the German Blitzkrieg, for “lightning war”), Nazi Germany’s eight-month wartime bombing campaign against Britain. This fall, London’s robust tourism industry will commemorate the capital’s time under siege. Already, assorted Blitz-themed walking tours abound. On a recent Sunday, several dozen tourists met near the Thames River for a “Westminster at War” tour (London Walks, £10, about $15; walks.com ), led by a bespectacled gentleman tour guide who sternly warned the attendees that they “mustn’t shilly-shally,” for there was much to see.

Another stop brought the tour to the Savoy Hotel, where some of the staff was fired in the early stages of war because they were Italian. “This entire area was rebuilt in the 1960s,” the guide explained, “when we had no money and no taste.” Several new exhibits consider how a variety of British citizens experienced the Blitz. At the Royal Air Force Museum, visitors can hop inside a Spitfire, the plane flown by British pilots as they battled the Luftwaffe (£4; rafmuseum.org.uk ). One wildly popular summer exhibition has been the Imperial War Museum’s delightfully titled “Fashion on the Ration.” (£10; iwm.org.uk ; through Aug. 31). Objects on display included a ladies’ handbag with a built-in compartment for government-issued gas masks, and posters urging women to maintain their appearance during the air raids, lest their dowdy looks undermine the morale of British men.

A favorite print on display at the war museum showed Churchill meeting Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, dressed, astonishingly, in what we would now call a romper, or onesie, belted around his ample belly. Churchill popularized these so-called “siren suits” — one-piece zip-up garments — as practical bomb shelter attire. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T14:12:18.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
