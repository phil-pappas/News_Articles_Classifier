TELAM/AFP \nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina – Two Argentines suspected of taking part in the FIFA corruption scandal were released from house arrest Friday, but will remain under surveillance awaiting a decision on their extradition to the United States. \nJudge Claudio Bonadio placed Hugo Jinkis and his son Mariano under strict police surveillance, and they remained barred from traveling outside the country. \nThe father, 70, and son, 40, run the marketing company Full Play and were among 14 suspects indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in its investigation of bribery and money laundering surrounding football’s global governing body. The duo had initially fled, but turned themselves in to authorities last week. \nAlong with another Argentinian businessman, Alejandro Burzaco, they are now awaiting a court decision on whether the U.S. extradition request will be granted by a Buenos Aires court. \nThe men have previously refused to be extradited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T01:10:01.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
