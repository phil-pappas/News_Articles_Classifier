The new DusitPrincess Cebu, set to open in 2018, will join the company’s Philippines flagship property the Dusit Thani Manila. \nIn a signing ceremony recently held at the City Sports Club in Cebu Business Park, representatives from Dusit International and Cebu-based developer Grand Land, Inc. (GLI), formalised an agreement to bring a DusitPrincess hotel to the Queen City of the South. \nDusit International’s DusitPrincess brand offers guests welcoming, efficient and affordable accommodation in key city and resort destinations. Embracing the culture and character of its surrounds, each DusitPrincess hotel combines essential business connectivity, efficient service, quality dining and leisure facilities with great value. \nStrategically located in the upbeat North Reclamation area of Metro Cebu, the high-rise DusitPrincess Cebu will offer 295 guest rooms with fantastic views of the city and the ocean. Its beautifully designed, international–standard facilities include restaurants, meeting rooms, a gym, and swimming pools. Part of a mixed-use development, there will also be a number of retail outlets, offices, and apartments complementing the hotel. \n“We are excited to grow our presence in the Philippines to include picturesque Cebu,” said Rustom Vickers, Group Director for Development, Dusit International. “With its position as a key gateway to Southern Philippines, strong corporate demand and myriad tourist attractions, the island is currently seeing a boom of development. We are thrilled to cater to the island’s growing demand alongside Grand Land, Inc., and we look forward to bringing Dusit’s brand of gracious hospitality to the city together.” \nMeanwhile, Ryan Bernard Go, President of Grand Land, Inc., expressed confidence that the company will be able to start the construction of the project this year. \n“This is one of the key projects we have in Cebu,” said Go, noting that the firm has decided to venture into the hotel-apartment business because it sees the need for Cebu tourism to have more branded hotels. \n“We want to expand the tourism industry so we hope to develop hotels and resorts, north or south of Cebu. The partnership with Dusit International may extend to more GLI hotel projects. For this project, there will be units in the integrated development to be sold to individual investors while office spaces will be made available for purchase,” Go disclosed. \n“We also want Cebu to be globally known as the Land of grand opportunities, and we hope that our Company, Grand Land, Inc. will be part of that vision,” Ryan Bernard Go said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:29:02.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
