The broken-hearted: A young man hoped an upgrade would mend his broken heart after being dumped on his birthday. \n3.

The entrepreneur : A businessman said he wanted to meet Richard Branson and pitch an idea to him on board. But I want to meet Branson! Source: Facebook \n5. The impatient traveller : A woman asked for an upgrade as she wanted to get to her destination quicker (what?)! \n6.

The fantasist : One man requested an upgrade so he could try out the on board hot tub (there are none, yet). \nMeanwhile, the most common reasons given for an upgrade include that it’s their birthday, they’re a “friend” of Mr Branson, and it’s their honeymoon. \nHere’s some advice on how to maximise your chances of being successful with your flight upgrade request .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:59:32.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
