Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 04, 2015 Adv: \nA 5star resort is set to open its doors along the Beau Vallon Beach of Mahe, the Seychelles’ main island. \nThe 100 villas and suites H Resort will welcome guests for the first time on the 10th of August, going by information received overnight from Victoria. \nKeeping in the best style of luxurious accommodation for which the Seychelles have become known across the world does the new development no doubt add pressure on some of the older and even newer resorts along BVB’s Golden Mile and beyond. No multiple story accommodation here will offend the eye as seen elsewhere along Beau Vallon and the developers have spared no expense to create an all-inclusive vacation experience all under one roof. In particular the facilities of the new resort have been described as leaving nothing for wanting. Several themed restaurants await guests to choose from including Seyshima, an authentic Japanese restaurant and Eden, their beachside seafood restaurant for intimate and romantic dinners. \nThe Sesel Spa will offer a range of treatments for guests and those opting for the opulent beach villas even have their own swimming pools, allowing for the privacy many guests seek these days. \nThe Beau Vallon Bay area has undergone some significant re-development over the past few years, making the core area more attractive and user-friendly for both visitors and locals alike. Paved walkways lead along local curio and food sellers to several restaurants which invite guests with either genuine Creole cuisine like at the Boathouse or exquisite seafood like at La Plage. \nTraffic permitting does it only take half an hour from the international airport to reach the new resort, and added bonus for those in a hurry to get to the beach and experience the powdery white sand between their toes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T10:23:10.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
