After sending a tweet congratulating them for joining the fight, we received an email from them with this statement. \n“Effective immediately, Air Canada will refuse to carry any shipment of lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and water buffalo trophies worldwide as freight. It should be noted that historically the shipment of such trophies has been extremely rare as Air Canada does not operate flights to Africa. This ban goes over and above Air Canada ‘s long-standing policy to comply strictly with the regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates that are in place to protect endangered wildlife in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES ).” \nBravo Air Canada, even though you don’t have direct flights to Africa and big game trophies on your flights would already be nearly zero, you made a statement to join forces with the other airlines who do operate flights to Africa and have historically allowed countless trophies on board. As for the naysayers who will say trophy hunting helps with conservation and that his $50,000 went to help the community. I say just donate $50,000. Why do you have to have a thrill of the kill in the name of conservation? See: Kenya in Photos a visual journey Canada and Big Game Hunting \nRegarding Canada’s own big Game Hunting we agree with Lesley Fox, executive director of The Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals . “It’s irrelevant whether or not it’s a legal trade or an illegal trade, Animals suffer and die the same way for needless products and trophies, and it’s something that we can do something about. We can end it.” (Quote taken from the National Post: Read the article here: Alberta big game hunter says Cecil Controversy will Pass ) Moose are hunted for trophies in Canada \nSo we put this challenge to airlines and governments out there. If everyone cares about Cecil, isn’t it time we stop the cargo of all needless trophies? Does anyone really want to see a bear skin or a lion head on a wall anyway? We would rather have a photograph on our wall or watch this other uplifting video from our South African Safari . Humans may be at the top of the food chain, but its time we start treating all living things with respect. From the chickens we eat to the trophies we slaughter and the countries we invade.

We have been disgusted with ourselves and the world we live in for our treatment of all living things on this earth. If we can do our small part in any way possible, we will try. My parents have been vegetarian for decades and we have always kept our meat consumption to a minimum, but we feel that it is time to stop living a life of hypocracy. We love animals, we give to animal charities, so why do we continue to eat them? As one person’s comment left on our facebook page, we cause more harm and pain to chickens every day than Walter Palmer did to Cecil the Lion. \nThanks to Wandertoot h for the great video edit bringing back memories of our time in Africa.
