The Bombay High Court on Thursday overturned a government ban on the hugely popular noodles , but ordered further tests be carried out to ensure they are safe to eat before going back on the shelves. The company needs to submit test reports within six weeks, the court said. Sales of the noodles had stopped two months ago after the food regulator ordered the nationwide recall as it said government tests found the noodles contained too much lead. Nestle India, the country’s top seller of noodles, filed the case on June 11 challenging the recall. A favorable ruling would validate the Swiss foodmaker’s insistence its products had been tested without finding abnormal levels of lead, said Naveen Trivedi, an analyst at Trust Financial Consultancy Services, before Thursday’s judgment. Nestle’s India unit on July 29 reported its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years due to the recall and sales halt on its biggest product. The cost of removing the product from the market led to a one-time exceptional loss of 4.52bn rupees — nearly 1.5 times the average profit in the last four quarters, the New Delhi-based company reported. Maggi noodles are hugely popular in India Photo: AFP “Nestle can easily regain the momentum that’s been lost,” Mr Trivedi said before the judgment. “If they can prove that technically the government lab tests were wrongly done, they can go to court and seek damages.” Nestle India’s shares rose 2.4pc to 6,381 rupees in Mumbai, after rallying as much as 5pc The judgment came as Nestle reported a small decline in sales and net profits in the first-half due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the noodle recall. The Swiss company behind Nescafe, Haagen Dazs and Perrier says sales fell to 42.8bn Swiss francs (£28bn) from 43bn a year earlier. Net profit slipped to 4.5bn francs from 4.6bn a year earlier. However, the results did exceed analyst estimates. Underlying sales increased 4.5pc, the company said, compared with consensus forecasts for a 4.2pc gain. The world's largest food company benefitted from accelerating sales in the Americas, led by KitKat chocolate bars and Dolce Gusto coffee. Revenues in the region grew 5.2pc in the first half, compared with 3.7pc growth in the first quarter, driven by pricing. A revamp of some of its ailing frozen-food brands has also shown “promising” initial signs. Chief executive Paul Bulcke says the results were \"solid even in difficult circumstances\" and that confirmed the company's outlook for growth in the full year. “Nestle’s results are surprising, they had a few headwinds with the Maggi noodles in India and a negative currency effect,” said Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank in Zurich. “Lower commodity costs surely provided some relief.” The bottler of San Pellegrino water reiterated its forecast that underly sales will increase about 5pc in the full year, with improvements in margins and underlying earnings. Sales have missed a long-term goal for average 5 percent to 6 percent annual growth in the past two years. To bolster growth, Nestle has expanded into skin health, having last year spent $5bn on acquisitions in the sector. Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
