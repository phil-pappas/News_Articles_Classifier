Here’s a list of top 10 pet-friendly hotels in NYC.\nDoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Metropolitan\nNear many of Manhattan’s east-side attractions, this recently revitalised hotel sports art-deco features from original architect Morris Lapidus—and welcomes both pooches and feline friends. Stay here and you and your pet will be a short walk from Park Avenue, Bloomingdale’s, the United Nations and Rockefeller Center. Each of the 764 guest rooms has been newly renovated, and the hotel features other amenities, including 24-hour fitness and business centers, plus the Met Grill and the Met Bar. One can also book the hotel’s ‘Pampered Pet Package’ and recieve an animal-print gift bag, which includes a fleece blanket, travel bowl and pet collar.\nGansevoort Meatpacking NYC\nThe Gansevoort is just as stylish a hangout for pets as for their owners. Upon arriving, your furry friend gets a collar tag, treats, a bed and a monogrammed mat. The hotel’s 163 rooms and 23 suites come in six sizes, starting at a standard queen and working up to the two-floor penthouse suite. The rooftop, which has excellent views of Lower Manhattan, features a 45-foot-long pool and bar. The new Whitney Museum, the High Line and Chelsea galleries are a short distance away.\nHyatt Union Square New York\nAs the name suggests, this new Hyatt location is just blocks from the tree-shaded hangout of Union Square, perfect for people- and pup-watching (it has a busy dog run and four-day-a-week farmers’ market).

The proprietors of acclaimed nearby restaurants Tocqueville and 15 East helm the hotel’s American brasserie, the Fourth, as well as its café, and there is an on-premises spa and gym.\nLoews Regency New York\nThis luxe hotel near Central Park extends its pet-friendly programme, Loews Loves Pets, to a special room-service menu for both cats and dogs, prepared by the hotel’s executive chef. Other amenities include pet beds and treats, maps of good dog-walking routes and—good for when you need a little break—pet-sitting and -walking services. The Loews Regency is a short hop from MoMA and Museum Mile, but you still might want to take advantage of the hotel’s Mercedes town car, which will drive you anywhere within a 20-block radius.\nMandarin Oriental, New York\nPerched at the very top of the Time Warner Center, the Mandarin Oriental offers sweeping Central Park views and lofty accommodations for your pet.
