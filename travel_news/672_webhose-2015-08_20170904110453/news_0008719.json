And the reason for this is pretty simple actually. They are capable of making us feel. (Agencies) \nBooks are said to be the best companions and they fulfill all our emotional needs with no strings attached. But, romance novels, they are usually scorned at by the literary types (You know what we mean), even when they reinforce our faith in love (Yes, we are fans!). \nRomance is the best selling genre of books. And the reason for this is pretty simple actually. They are capable of making us feel. They provide us with easy entertainment, and a means of escaping to a world unknown (and less depressing). \nIf you are a connoisseur of romance then you understand the importance of the authors we are about to list. And if you are a newbie to the genre, then let's easy you into it, shall we? 1 Danielle Steele Her books add a touch of colour into your life and you end up learning so (so, so, so) much. Her books would inspire you to get up, get dressed and conquer the world. Most of her stories focus on women who have gone through adverse circumstances and are working towards a better future. Prime examples being Big Girl, Journey and Full Circle. \n2 Nora Roberts Nora Roberts is one of the most successful romantic authors of all time. She apparently takes 45 days to write a book; maybe that is why she has written more than 225 books. Born In series, The Villa, Three Fates, Sweet Revenge, Chasing Fire are must-read Nora Roberts books, for every single one of us. \n3 Kelly Favor One of her most famous book series is the For His Pleasure book series. The story follows your typical romance novel pattern and it reflects Fifty Shades of Grey. But unlike Fifty Shades, Red seems more humane. If you want to read something like Fifty Shades, or if you thought Fifty was completely BS (bull$h*t), then Kelly Favor's books might prove to be worth your time. Just look at book covers! \n4 Catherine Coulter Catherine Coulter combines romance and thrill: Her books really are the best combination there is of romance, thrill and suspense. They make for a perfect read for those of us who shy away from conventional romance. Her series like The Bride series and the Legacy Series are our personal faves. \n5 Nalini Singh If you need a little paranormal romance in your life, then Nalini Singh should be your go-to author. No, her books are not like Twilight or Vampire Diaries. She creates unique characters. She gives them happy endings, which is what romance novels should be about, essentially. Her series like the Psy-Changelings series and the Guild Hunter series will leave you wanting more! \nWe need love (And a lot of it). Reading these authors would bring a lot of love to your life and they will leave you with this 'feel good' feeling. And once you read one of these romance novel, and fall in love with it, there is no going back.
