The plants it is named for were dubbed cirios — or candles — in Spanish, evidently because of their resemblance to tapered church candles at the missions nearby.\nIf you go Baja California Where The Valley of the Boojums is in the middle of the approximately 760 mile Baja California peninsula and can be reached by car. Vehicles can be rented either in Tijuana near the Mexico-U. S. border in the north or in the resorts of La Paz or Los Cabos in the south. Guerrero Negro also has a small airport with regional service.\nTours Visiting the lagoons where you can watch whales is possible only through authorized tour operators. Guides for the lagoons and for seeing cave drawings can be found in Guerrero Negro or through tour companies.\nMore info Mexican tourist office: visitmexico.com\nSouthwestern naturalist Godfrey Sykes later christened that same tree the “boojum,” for an imaginary animal character in Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem “The Hunting of the Snark.”\nMost Read Stories Inside Amazon: wrestling big ideas in a bruising workplace Rainier melting unleashes ‘glacial outbursts’ of debris Chelan evacuates as lightning triggers fires east of Cascades Flames, anguish strike Chelan as spreading wildfires burn homes Man walking his dog is slain in Central District Birds abound, such as pelicans and ospreys, and peninsular pronghorns, once hunted to near extinction, roam the desert landscape. Under a Mexican government program, the hoofed animals are making a comeback from their once critically endangered status. Among the oldest known mammals in the Americas, the pronghorns are known locally as “ghosts of the desert” because their golden brown or tan color and white markings helps camouflage them.\nNearby, visitors can see ancient cave paintings depicting deer, whales and humans with six fingers.\nThe stark beauty and solitude are a far cry from the fancy restaurants, pools with swim-up bars, fishing, snorkeling and sunbathing at the southern end of the Sea of Cortez, the long slip of water sandwiched between the Baja Peninsula and Mexico’s mainland. The peninsula was once eloquently described in a travel journal by American writer John Steinbeck; its stunning coral reefs were praised by ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau.\nA short way to the south, magnificent gray whales arrive every year off the Pacific Coast town of Guerrero Negro, following one of the world’s longest migration routes between Mexico and Alaska. They mate and calve in the lagoons nearby.\nMexico’s government says there were more than 2,600 whales in the lagoons at the end of February, including adults and calves — among the highest numbers in 19 years and 10 percent more than last season.\nGuerrero Negro has a long whaling history and was named for the whaling ship Black Warrior that partially sank in the area in 1858.\nAlso here is the largest salt-making facility on the planet. The salt is extracted from ocean water by evaporation, taking advantage of the region’s low yearly rainfall, its large areas of flatlands and high solar radiation.\nDARIO LOPEZ-MILLS", "external_links": ["http://www.visitmexico.com/"], "published": "2015-08-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T17:16:06.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
