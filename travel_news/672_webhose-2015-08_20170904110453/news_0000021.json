In the first six months of 2015 the country welcomed 3.85 million tourists, up 3.4% on the same six months in 2014. \nIndia is looking to increase its tourism numbers further by enticing tour operators from global source markets to promote the country as a year round luxury destination. \nThe key to India’s strategy is to focus on a variety of niche products including; rural, wellness, medical, adventure, golf, MICE and cruise tourism –to overcome the aspect of ‘seasonality’ spread tourists around the country by promoting India as a 365 days destination, and expanding out from its most popular period of October to March. \nIndia’s most popular destinations are Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, popularly known as the Golden Triangle, Rajasthan, Goa, Kerala and Kashmir. However, a greater focus is being put on North East India – Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram. \nFurthermore, India has an array of new products to promote to the world’s leading buyers at WTM London 2015; including the development of its cruise industry, which will see Royal Caribbean include Indian ports in its itineraries from October. Other leading global cruise companies operating from India include Oceania Cruise and AIDA Cruise. \nA string of luxury global hotel chains including Rotana, Meininger, Jumeirah and Six Senses are scheduled to open a number of hotels in the next two years, further enhancing India’s position as a luxury destination. \nThe UK is India’s second largest source market for tourists with 810,000 people visiting in 2014. \nIndia will look to sign deals at WTM 2015 with UK tour operators that will see the number of visitors from the country increase to one million in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T21:12:52.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
