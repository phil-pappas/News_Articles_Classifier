The three excellent 18 hole golf courses, the exclusive hotel and four-star spa and the prime location just 30 minutes from Malaga airport, provide the perfect setting for capturing the growing European demand for second homes on the Costa del Sol.\nTaylor Wimpey and La Cala Resort began working together in 2014, with the development of Miraval – a complex of 60 luxury apartments overlooking the golf course and sea. After 12 months of activity, more than 50% of Miraval’s properties had been purchased. In fact, the resort proved so popular that work was accelerated in order to provider owners with their new homes earlier in 2016.\nThis high level of interest from overseas buyers has prompted both companies to enhance and extend their working relationship. Thus January 2016 will see work begin simultaneously on a new complex of 55 townhouses and one of 48 apartments. The two developments will involve a total investment of €21 million over the coming five years.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:58:53.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
