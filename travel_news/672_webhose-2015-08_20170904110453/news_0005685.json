The palace's management has called for a tender to create a hotel in three 1680s buildings situated just outside the Versailles park's gates, with views of some of its most famous buildings, the Journal du Dimanche said. It would cost 4 million to 7 million euros (US$4.44 million-$7.77 million) to renovate the run-down buildings and as much to build a hotel within their walls, the bid for tender said, according to the newspaper. A previous plan to build a hotel there was abandoned a few years ago. Versailles was transformed by King Louis XIV in the 17th century from a hunting lodge into the dazzling heart of an absolutist state, with a stunning palace and gardens. The call for tender for a 60-year concession on the Grand Controle, Petit Controle and Pavillon buildings meant to become a hotel will close on September 14, the Journal du Dimanche wrote. The Versailles administration could not be reached for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T16:45:59.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
