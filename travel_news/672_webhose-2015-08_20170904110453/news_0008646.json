An official went on record yesterday that initially three streets were going pedestrian next week but that an expansion was planned after the initial measure had been reviewed and assessed, to expand the scheme across the almost entire CBD. \nShuttles will at the time the cars are banned give access to the pedestrian zone from designated parking areas while the city administration was also going to create green areas within the car free area. \nThe social media in Rwanda were predictably buzzing when the announcement was made, first dismissing it as a rumour but when a formal notice was given then taking issue with access to the businesses located in the CBD. \nThe move is reportedly contained in a master plan development for the city, which will make Kigali the first of the East African capitals with a dedicated inner city pedestrian zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:11:46.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
