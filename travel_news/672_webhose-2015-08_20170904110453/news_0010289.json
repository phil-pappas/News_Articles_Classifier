It evolved into the store it is today soon after that.\nEmployees: 326\nLocations: 33, spread throughout Western Washington and Western Oregon\nAdvice to business owners: Find the right business partner, build a good leadership team and be inclusive and open with your employees. A business is much more than an Excel spreadsheet, the Wulffs said.\nDid you know?: People who work for Mud Bay are known as “muddies.”\nIt’s been a longtime dream for co-CEOs and siblings Lars and Marisa Wulff, who have been actively involved with the business since the early 1990s after their mother, Elsa, bought an existing business in 1988.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time They became serious about creating an ESOP in 2002. After doing their research and talking to other employee-owned companies — as well as making sure the business had grown to the point where they could afford the plan and create meaningful ownership stakes — they finally executed the ESOP documents.\n“It did take until now but it feels really good,” Marisa Wulff said.\nIn addition to being a long-term goal, the Wulffs said their research shows that creating an ESOP and developing an ownership culture can help a business grow 5-10 percent faster a year.\nThe existing employees are eligible to become owners of Mud Bay. In the future, though, employees will have to work at least 1,000 hours in a calendar year before they can join the plan, the Wulffs said.\nIn addition to the ESOP, Mud Bay also offers medical insurance and a 401(k) retirement plan but no company match.\nBut Lars Wulff expects the ESOP will generate interest in the 401(k) offering. That’s because longtime employees who leave Mud Bay and those who retire will be able to sell their stock back to the company, generating income that could be invested in other ways, such as into the 401(k), he said.\nKristy Bradley, 38, who has worked for Mud Bay for more than two years and now manages the west Olympia store, praised the idea of the ESOP, saying she welcomes the chance to become part of something bigger at the business.\nShe also said the Wulffs have done a good job of explaining the ESOP and making employees part of the process, rather than just pushing it on them.\n“I can make a career here, and that’s important,” Bradley said.\nMud Bay has grown an average 20 percent a year and more growth is on the way. The business has, so far this year, opened a store in Beaverton, Ore., and four more are planned before the end of the year in Sammamish, Bellingham and in Hillsboro and Tualatin, Ore.\n“We will stay a Northwest company for the foreseeable future,” Marisa Wulff said.\nRolf Boone", "external_links": ["https://www.nceo.org/articles/esop-employee-stock-ownership-plan"], "published": "2015-08-29T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:32:31.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
