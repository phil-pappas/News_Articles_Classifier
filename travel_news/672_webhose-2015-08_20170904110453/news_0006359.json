There are many beautiful and captivating cultural and natural sites that are actually unaffected by the earthquake. \n\n“Out of 75 districts in Nepal, only 11 districts are damaged and we are hopeful to see travellers coming back again.” \n\nAccording to Subedi, Nepal's top three visitor markets are India, China and the US, but the numbers have plunged since the earthquake. \n\n“But we are optimistic that tourism will pick up again with greater awareness made about (the safety of) the destination,” he added. \n\nBhutan, which is exhibiting at NATAS for the first time, earlier declared 2015 as Visit Bhutan Year to commemorate the 60th birth anniversary of the king. As such, hotels and tour operators are dangling special offers and promotions to coincide with this celebratory year. \n\nMargaret Loh, managing director of Airelated Travel, said: “Traditionally our top three selling destinations are South Korea, Japan and Taiwan especially for the families during the year-end holidays. \n\n“For the more exotic destinations like Nepal and Bhutan, it will be either for the FITs or the more seasoned, adventurous travellers who know what they want in a trip,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:13:58.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
