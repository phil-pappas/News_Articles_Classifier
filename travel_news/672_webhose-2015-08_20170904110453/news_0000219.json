Patty Murray, D-Wash., has introduced a bill to return the bones of Kennewick Man to a group of Columbia Basin tribes. \nExperts believe the remains, discovered in 1996 near the Columbia River in Kennewick, are at least 8,400 years old. \nThat makes Kennewick Man one of the oldest and most complete skeletons found in North America. \nIn June, new genetic evidence determined the remains are closer to modern Native American than any other population worldwide.
