This is where safari outfitters like African Travel, Inc. can really make a difference, by offering unique and exciting programs encouraging travelers to actively participate in conservation.\" \nBanda, who was born and raised in Cape Town, has spent more than 17 years in the international hospitality industry including various positions in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Banda's proven dedication to optimizing resource efficiency fits perfectly with African Travel, Inc.'s mission to protect endangered wildlife, ecosystems, and communities. \n\"Africa continues to be a must-visit travel destination, but travelers now want to give back to the communities they visit and leave a legacy of their own,\" said Banda. \"African Travel, Inc. provides numerous ways for guests to invest in Africa's future by donating their time, expertise, or physical labor to projects in East and Southern Africa. We are heralding the new age of voluntourism.\" \nAfrican Travel, Inc., which was recently ranked the #3 Top Safari Outfitter in Travel + Leisure 's coveted 2015 World's Best Awards , supports numerous philanthropic programs and collaborates with the TreadRight Foundation , a not-for-profit organization working to preserve the environment and communities affected by tourism.
