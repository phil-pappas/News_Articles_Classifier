In June 2014, the rate was 0.70 on nearly one million fewer customers during the month.\nIn results that bested American Airlines/US Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, Deltaâ€™s completion factor, a measure of scheduled flights that did not cancel, finished at 99.7 percent. On-time arrivals as measured by the Department clocked-in at 82.2 percent and mishandled baggage reports finished at 2.30 per 1,000 customers flown.\nFor Delta employees, these reports are tied to an incentive program called Shared Rewards. If internal or comparative ranking thresholds are met consisting of the airlines mentioned above in addition to Alaska Airlines and JetBlue Airways, each employee earns a payout for a maximum of $100 when goals for completion factor, on-time arrivals and baggage handling are met.\nFor June performance, the maximum will be paid out to Delta employees.\nSource: Delta Air Lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:42:04.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
