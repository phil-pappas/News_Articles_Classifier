Same for Burgundy, whose vineyards are already a big draw – it, too, is now on Unesco’s roll of honour . The double good news marks a major gain for France, which is trying hard to make wine a pillar of its tourist economy.\nLaurent Fabius, the country’s foreign minister and a strong backer of tourism, has made the wine sector a priority. His goal is to attract 100 million tourists to France, up from 82 million in 2012, with wine as one of the principal draws. According to a 2010 study by the tourism development agency Atout France (Rendezvous En France, in English) , a third of visitors say they choose their destination based on, among other things, food and wine. The agency estimates 7.5 million people a year tour the country’s wineries, including 2.5 million foreign visitors.\nRelated: Burgundy by bike: a wine-tasting weekend\nFrance’s wine industry has long promoted tourism, and that has helped smaller producers survive. Indeed, tourism has become an essential part of their business, as important as promoting their wines at trade shows and, of course, exporting them.\nIt’s difficult to say how much is bought by tourists on site, but the income from direct sales contributes appreciably to the more than €12bn ($13bn) annual sales of wine in France , according to a 2013 study by the government’s FranceAgriMer agency. “We sell 40% of our production to visitors who’ve come to see us and another 30% goes to export,” said Florian Beck-Hartweg, who runs an organic vineyard in the east Alsatian commune of Dambach-la-Ville. “There has to be one person on staff at all times for cellar tours and tastings. Afterwards, our clients keep up with us on Facebook. We post news almost every day on what we’re doing. Social networks allow us to stay in touch.”\nAlsace was the first wine region in France to establish a tourist “route des vins”. For more than 60 years, the region has been devising itineraries to help navigate its network of hundreds of producers, large and small. “We came up with the ‘picnic with a winemaker’ concept 15 years ago,” said Philippe Blanck, co-owner of the Kientzheim winery Domaine Paul Blanck & Fils and president of the trade association Vignerons indépendants de France.\n“This year,” he said, “we attracted 25,000 visitors from across France.” The association loved the picnic idea and now, every May over the Pentecost weekend, its members open their vineyards to visitors.\nInspired by such initiatives, government and industry have stepped in to give some structure and professionalism to the process, something they feel befits France’s status as the world’s top wine-producing country (46.7m hectolitres a year), biggest wine exporter (with an estimated €4.7bn in sales in 2014), and number-one tourist destination (more than 84 million visitors in 2014).\nIn 2000, Atout France set up what it called a “wine tourism cluster”. In 2009, under agriculture minister Michel Barnier, the government then established an advisory body, the Conseil supérieur de l’œnotourisme. Its founding director was Paul Dubrule, former CEO of Accor, the multinational hotel chain, and owner of Domaine de la Cavale winery in Cucuron, in the Vaucluse. He was succeeded last year by Florence Cathiard, owner of Château Smith Haut Lafitte, in Bordeaux, and since then a new name has appeared on the wine tourism landscape: Vignobles et découvertes .\nThe designation covers an area that, in a radius of about 30km, offers everything a wine tourist needs: accommodation, restaurants, estate tours and also access to cultural and natural heritage sites, all of approved quality. While the new designation has sparked a lot of interest in the tourism industry, it has yet to make its full mark on tourists themselves. To date, some 54 destinations have been classified Vignobles et découvertes. The designation brings together wineries and tourist services.\nIt has had mixed results from region to region. For example, tourists usually visit the Savoie for the skiing, not the wine , though some do make a trip to the vineyards and taste local wines such as Chignin, Crépy and Chautagne – in fact, three-quarters of all Savoy wines are consumed in situ. It’s the same story in Corsica, which tourists visit for the landscape and climate . Local winemakers promote their products to visitors and sell to restaurants on the island. In contrast, in the Loire Valley , which has been a Unesco world heritage site since 2000, the region’s wine and food are as much a part of the allure as the historic cities and castles.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Epernay, in France, is known as the principal centre for champagne wines. Photograph: Michael Busselle/Robert Harding World Imagery/Corbis\nIn Champagne, there are causes for both hope and concern. The region believes it has lived in the shadow of its sparkling wine for too long; people are more inclined to drink champagne than visit the region itself. Global sales totalled €4.5bn in 2014, outstripping Bordeaux wines – €3.74bn – but tourism hasn’t kept pace.\n“People know champagne, not Champagne, and yet we’re only 45 minutes by TGV from Paris,” said wine grower Pierre Cheval, who spearheaded the campaign to get a Unesco listing. He believes the new designation will encourage visitors to discover Champagne’s wine heritage such as the historic hillsides around Epernay; the abbey of St Peter in Hautvillers that was home to the monk Dom Pérignon ; and the famous St Nicaise Hill in Reims where wines are made and stored in huge underground cellars. Cheval expects the number of visitors to Champagne to jump by between 20% and 30%, the usual tourist boost a place sees following a Unesco listing.That was case after Saint-Emilion was named a world heritage site in 1999. It now has half a million visitors a year.\n“We now have 500,000 tourists coming to see our wineries, and three out of five are foreigners – the numbers are growing rapidly,” said Laurence Prévot of Champagne’s tourism authority .\nThere are now more tourist activities in France’s wine regions. You can walk from winery to winery on gastronomic tours such as Les Charrois gourmands in Beaujolais; discover the Ventoux by electric bicycle, run a marathon in Sauternes, or do the TransLayon in the Loire on foot, horseback, bike or canoe. Some of the larger chateaux host concerts and exhibitions in their parks and gardens. And, of course, there’s a wide choice of vineyard and cellar tours; you can also help bring in the grapes at harvest time. Some regions have even extended the tourist season into winter: in December at the Cave de Crouseilles winery in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, you can take part in the late harvest of white grapes for Pacherenc-du-Vic-Bilh, a local dessert wine.\nSome cities are investing in infrastructure to tell visitors about the local wine heritage and gastronomy. Bordeaux will open a Cité des civilisations du vin in 2016; Dijon will have a Cité internationale de la gastronomie in 2018; and Beaune is developing its own Cité des vins – all intended as gateways to local wineries.\nMichel Bernard, owner of the Vaucluse winery Château Beauchêne and president of Atout France’s wine tourism division, has a message for growers: “Wine tourism has developed a bit in every direction and its goals have been a bit pie-in-the-sky,” he said. Nevertheless, the investment in terms of money and people has been significant. “If the point is simply to put yourself on the map, then that budget should be considered promotional; if the goal is to turn a profit, then tourism should be your second priority and be mastered.”\nLes Vignerons de Tutiac, a wine cooperative in the Gironde commune of Marcillac, recently invested €1m to design a new tour route and update its shop, which sells 275,000 bottles a year, to improve visitor information about where to go and what to buy. Another Vaucluse winery, the Cave cooperative de Cairanne, also invested heavily to develop a “route of the senses”, but has since gone bankrupt. Some owners have hired well-known architects to build magnificent new cellars, but the costs for such projects can be huge.\nSome wine producers have added ventures such as running bed-and-breakfasts and renting out holiday cottages, keeping business in the region and benefiting their neighbours. Bienvenue à la ferme, a network of farms with accommodation, has added Les fermes Bacchus, wine estates that offer winemaking and appreciation courses. Les Sources de Caudalie, in Bordeaux, want to set up a network of luxury vineyard hotels. With an American partner, owners Alice and Jérôme Tourbier created the Royal Champagne hotel in Champillon, situated between Reims and Epernay, and hope to build more hotels in Alsace and Provence.\nBernard, the Atout France executive, recently submitted a report on wine tourism that overturns ideas of celebrity chefs Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy on how to promote food and wine in France. “It’s pointless to be inspired by what American wineries and Spanish bodegas are doing,” he said. “When tourists come to France, they want to see French winemaking.”\nHe doesn’t promote wine tourism at Château Beauchêne, however; he prefers to rent the place out for weddings and conferences – yet another popular way for wine estates to diversify.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A tasting at a winery in Napa Valley, California, a region which receives almost 5 million tourists a year. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty California’s Napa Valley is suffocating, thanks to the tourists\nThis year, as every year, thousands of tourists flocked to the cradle of American winemaking, the Napa Valley , for the Fourth of July holiday. Firefighters got pride of place in the parade to honour their role during the earthquake of 24 August 2014 . There were fireworks along the Napa river. In the words of the local paper, the Napa Valley Register, it all had that “small-town American touch”.\nOr maybe not. The Napa Valley hasn’t been “small-town” for years. It’s now a traffic jam of tourists who arrive by the busload or in their SUVs to spend a few hours in the Mediterranean-like climate of this narrow strip of land some 100km north of San Francisco. The 55km-long valley is a sort of closed circuit that passes through some 400 wineries. The trail starts on Route 128, heading north from Napa to Calistoga , then dips down along the Silverado Trail past Rutherford , Mumm and other wineries. Wine tourism took off here in the 1960s. Now it’s got so big it’s suffocating.\nRelated: California’s Paso Robles wine route: top 10 guide\nWhen Robert Mondavi opened the region’s first winery in 1966, the valley was a haven of hills in the Italian style, lined with cypress trees, a refuge from San Francisco and its summer fogs. Today the Napa Valley gets close to 5 million visitors a year. With its own tourist train, the Wine Train Express, Napa itself has become a kind of Las Vegas of wine. Each winery has its own exuberant architectural style. There’s a Greek monastery painted all in white ( Sterling Vineyards ), a pseudo-Egyptian temple ( Clos Pegase ), a Chinese garden ( Chateau Montelena ). The son of Italian immigrants, with a degree in economics from Stanford University, Mondavi styled himself the inventor of the business model that has shaped the fortune of the valley: wine tourism. Wineries offer tastings, fine dining, site rentals for private parties, reservation-only picnic tables, festivals such as the Bootleggers Ball in Yountville, north of Napa (commemorating the end of Prohibition on 5 December 1933), and live auctions of top wines followed by an oh-so-chic Governor’s Ball.\nThe tastings bring in big bucks: $20 minimum per person, $40 with a guided tour. Not much effort is made to educate the public; it’s rare to see a wine expert or winemaker. The tastings are essentially an exercise in selling to people whose wine savvy doesn’t match that of the average amateur drinker in Europe. Some wineries get more than 250,000 visitors a year.\nA new law that makes it easier to clear what little land is left for development promises to lower the water table even more than it already is, a victim of high demand caused by drought. “Everybody wants to build their own events centre,” says James Conaway , author of Napa and its follow-up The Far Side of Eden. He’s writing a third book, specifically on wine tourism. Napa Valley’s success can’t continue, he warns, without putting into peril its prime resource: nature.
