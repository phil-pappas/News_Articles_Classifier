He was 53 years old. \n\nPatrick was no stranger to many industry members, many of whom he had captured through his lens at travel tradeshows. He often brought life to the stands, not just to the pictorial pages of TTG Asia daily newspapers, but even during business negotiations. Meetings could stop in mid-air and serious faces would turn to huge smiles as he cajoled, teased and ribbed industry members to laughter and action. \n\n\nSending Patrick out to the tradeshow floor meant he would be pulled by sellers and buyers in 10 different directions – and Patrick would always oblige. He loved the industry as much as the industry loved him. Even in his last hours, he was hoping to come back to work, saying he missed the action. \n\nA true professional whose humble ways belied deep experience and expertise in photography, Patrick took pride in his work. He cared for his photos the way any serious journalist cares for his/her copy. He would be the first to grab the daily and check if the printers had not messed up the colours of his pictorial pages. \n\nA sad Darren Ng, managing director of TTG Asia , said: “Patrick’s dedication to TTG and to the industry was unique and touching. He did not work for the money and he would give it his all at every tradeshow – that kind of consistency just showed how much he loved what he was doing. \n\n“ TTG has lost an exceptional employee and I have lost a great friend.” \n\nRaini Hamdi, senior editor, said: “Patrick once shared a secret with me. He said he still felt nervous at every tradeshow, no matter how many he had done. It made me realise what a consummate photojournalist he was and how lucky we were to have him on the team. Patrick also loved to joke – clean jokes, dirty jokes, funny jokes – he kept us going in our press room. I cannot believe he is no longer with us.” \n\n\"It is often said that no one is irreplaceable, but Patrick is the exception. Tradeshows and work trips will never be the same without him,\" added Karen Yue, group editor. \n\nXinyi Liang-Pholsena, assistant editor was at a loss for words, but said: “His presence will be sorely missed. Patrick was part of my learning journey at TTG , a mentor who helped me learn the ropes of reporting at tradeshows and breaking the ice when speaking to buyers. Without him, many stories wouldn't have been filed.” \n\nPatrick always exclaimed \"give me the thumbs up sign!\" right before clicking the shutter, mentions Paige Lee Pei Qi, assistant editor. \n\n“He was the tradeshow icon – armed with his camera and wide smile – that everyone knew and wanted to know. But more than an icon or a colleague, Patrick was also my friend and a fatherly figure who guided me into the industry, with nothing short of his wicked sense of humour. Although it is hard to say goodbye, I believe Patrick will be pleased with the legacy he has left behind,” she added. \n\nMimi Hudoyo, Indonesia editor, said: \"Patrick was a true team player. He did not only care about having enough photos to fill the picture pages, but also helped reporters get stories. He would approach us and asked if we needed to speak to certain buyers and he would help identify them. \n\n\"He was more than a colleague to me. He was a kind, caring and mood-boosting friend.” \n\nIn parting, S Puvaneswary, Malaysia editor, said: “I never knew how much I would miss Patrick until now. He was always a good breakfast companion, cheerful and lively in the mornings, his enthusiasm for life was infectious. I will cherish the memories.” \n\nA wake will be held at 3pm today, August 28, at the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the Oratory Room, located along 1259 Upper Serangoon Road. The entrance can be found opposite Punggol Park. \n\nOur heartfelt condolences go to Patrick’s wife, Irene, and his two daughters. He will not be forgotten by us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T07:42:08.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
