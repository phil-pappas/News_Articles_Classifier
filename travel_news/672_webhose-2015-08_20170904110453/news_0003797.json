There are some programs that will allow you to speed through security and customs. If you are a low-risk traveler, you can apply for the TSA Precheck or the Global Entry programs and get access to the fast lanes at the airport.\nMembers of these programs who are traveling domestically can speed through security in a special lane without having to take off shoes, belts or jackets and can keep laptops and liquids in their luggage. The Global Entry program has the added benefit of faster lines in customs.\nThe TSA Precheck program costs $85 for five years and is good for domestic security lines when flying on Air Canada, Alaska, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Sun Country, United, US Airways and Virgin America.\nGlobal Entry costs $100 for five years. You get the benefits of TSA Precheck and it allows you to speed through customs and immigration lines when traveling abroad. You do need a current passport to apply for Global Entry, along with another government-issued ID.\nHow it works\nI recently did my personal interview for Global Entry, which took less than 10 minutes. I was asked about my criminal history and gave fingerprints.\nFilling out the application online took me 30 minutes, and getting an appointment time that works can take weeks in Dallas. If you will be traveling internationally in the coming months, apply now. It can take 60 days to schedule an interview. If you need to cancel your appointment, it can take weeks or months to reschedule. If you want to grab a date that opens up due to a cancellation, you have to check the website often and act fast before another traveler takes the opening.\nYour travel companion won’t get the same privileges if he doesn’t have Global Entry.\nMy passport expires in 2018, so once I get my new passport, I can take it to the Global Entry office to get the remaining two years of my membership extended to the new passport. I won’t need an appointment, so I won’t have to schedule weeks in advance.\nMedical conditions\nI have a colleague who has a medical condition that requires her to surpass the carry-on allowance of liquids. She applied for Global Entry partly so she could have an easier time bringing her medication in her carry-on luggage. She did bring documentation with her to her interview, including a doctor’s note and all of her prescriptions.\nAlthough my colleague has TSA preapproval, she always lets the agents know she has medical issues and takes a doctor’s note with a recent date, listing the medicines and why they are needed. This eliminates a lot of questions at the TSA, and they usually just wave her through with no problem. If you have a disability or medical issue that requires extra assistance during security screening, visit tsa.gov/traveler-information/travelers-disabilities-and-medical-conditions for information.\nPassport app\nIf you don’t have Global Entry, the Mobile Passport Control app allows you to fill out customs forms online. This can speed up the process if you don’t have pre-approval through Global Entry. It is currently only available for customs in Atlanta, Chicago O’Hare, Miami, San Francisco and Seattle. Visit mobilepass port.us for details.\nTime is money, and for many people, it is worth the fee and the time to sign up so you can speed through lines at the airport. If you hate removing your shoes and jacket at the security lines, don’t like long lines and prefer to get from point A to point B in 10 minutes instead of two hours, this $100 investment for five years is a must.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T00:32:49.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
