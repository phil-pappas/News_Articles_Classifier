Art Mels Spicy Dicy garnered enough votes to be among the top five of vote-getters. However, Art Mels has politely declined to participate in the judging round.\nMore than 1,200 votes were cast in the competition either online or by telephone.\n“The level of participation and effort from business owners and the public far exceeded our expectations,” said Pat Phillip-Fairn, the BTA’s chief product and experiences development officer. “After the judges have determined the winner on Wednesday we will survey the enrolled participants to better understand what impact this competition had on their business. Based on social media and the number of votes received, clearly the level of interest among customers was high.\n“We would like to thank the culinary community and the voting public for engaging in this competition so enthusiastically. Bermuda is unquestionably proud of its food culture and we look forward to highlighting the full spectrum of that pride in the visitor experience going forward.”\nA video featuring some of the telephone messages recorded during the competition was released earlier today. The public is invited to attend the voting portion of the competition at Harbour Nights on Front Street this Wednesday evening at 7:30pm.\nSource:- Bermuda Tourism Authority", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:37:12.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
