To contribute in keeping Bali’s beaches clean and safe, Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia and Quiksilver are holding Bali’s Big Eco Weekend 2015 from August 14-16, inviting local communities, the government, visitors and industry players of Bali to renew the commitment and take real action to tackle the waste problem in Bali.\nBali’s Big Eco Weekend is an annual campaign of the regular Bali Beach Clean-Up, both initiated by Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia (CCAI) and Quiksilver as continuous efforts to bring more attention to Bali’s environmental state and drive more support for the Bali government’s program in creating a ‘Clean and Green Bali’.\n“We’ve invested in the programs since 2007 and it has been a very good collaboration between Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia, Quiksilver, the Bali government and local communities. While the regular beach cleaning has been contributing impact, through Bali’s Big Eco Weekend we are still calling for more support from everyone in Bali, including both the growing citizens and tourists,” says Kadir Gunduz, President Director of Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia.\n“At Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia, we believe that we have roles and responsibilities in helping to create a sustainable environment anywhere we operate. It’s about all of us making the right decisions and taking real actions. We are pleased with the strong support we are getting, especially today. We hope that the commitment will only grow stronger, so together we can continue to preserve our ecosystem,” Kadir adds.\nThis year’s Bali’s Big Eco Weekend marks the 8th year of Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia’s and Quiksilver’s commitment to keeping Bali’s beaches clean & safe. Started in 2007, Bali Beach Clean Up (BBCU) empowers the local communities in Bali by hiring 78 local workers and providing them with regular training in waste management and clean environment awareness. As front-liners, BBCU workers run daily clean-up in 5 iconic beaches in Bali (Jimbaran, Legian, Kuta, Seminyak, Kedonganan) and maximize the clean-up facilities which include 3 surf rakes, 3 garbage trucks, 4 beach tractors, and at least 150 new bins per year. The total amount of waste collected through the program has reached more than 29 million kilograms as of July 2015.\n“We are glad that the collaboration in keeping Bali clean and safe has been going well for 8 years. This cements Quiksilver’s passion and involvement in promoting eco conservation to ensure that Bali’s beautiful beaches and waterways will stay clean and safe for many years to come,” says Paul Hutson, General Manager of Quiksilver South Pacific. “We have Quiksilver’s global athletes joining the Bali’s Big Eco Weekend this year, and everyone is excited to celebrate Indonesia’s Independence Day long weekend on the beaches of Jimbaran, Legian and Uluwatu.”\nSource:-Bali Beach", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T08:02:44.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
