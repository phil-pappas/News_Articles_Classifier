More than one in two said they would take their child out of school anyway, if permission for an authorised absence was refused, and 45 per cent said they would report their child as sick.\nFamilies face fines of £60 per child if the local authority decides to pursue the matter, rising to £120 if fines are not paid within 21 days.\nRefusal to pay could result in a £2,500 fine and up to a three-month jail sentence.\nMany parents said they would not be put off the action by the threat of a fine for truancy which has seen some being fined £60 per child for 'unauthorised absence'\nCaroline Lloyd, of Gocompare.com travel insurance, said: 'The subject of term time holidays has come close to sparking a parents' revolt.\n'With holiday and flight prices jumping substantially at the start of the school holidays and falling again when the children go back to school, it's no surprise that parents are fed up with being made to feel like criminals for trying to have a family holiday they can afford.\n'Unless the Government compels travel companies and airlines to cap school holiday price increases or introduces staggered school holiday periods to reduce the effects of a six week high season, parents will have to resign themselves to either paying more for their holidays and staying on the right side of the school and education authority, or, in extreme cases, breaking the rules and risking a fine.\n'With a family saving over £600 by taking children out of school for their holiday, it's not hard to see why some parents aren't put off by a fine from their local authority.'\nParents estimate the extra cost of taking family breaks during school holidays is a whopping £679\nCatherine Barnett, headteacher of Eveswell Primary School in Newport, South Wales, said the school would take all five inset days in one week next year\nHowever one school in South Wales offers up a suggestion which could be a solution to the problem.\nParents at the 485-pupil Eveswell Primary School in Newport, South Wales, were told last month that five days will be free from lessons during June next year, to allow them to book cheaper summer holidays.\nHeadteacher Catherine Barnett said staff would take part in back-to-back training days during the week-long break, which is hoped will stop non-attendance at other times during the school year.\nIt breaks with tradition where schools are allowed to have five staff training days - known as inset days - a year but normally spread them out.\nMrs Barnett said: 'There will be five training days for staff where the school is closed to pupils.\n'It has been decided to take these as one whole week with the hope that cheaper holidays can be booked and therefore holidays will not affect attendance at other times in the year.\n'This will be Monday 6 to Friday 10 June 2016.'\nThe days add an extra week to the Whitsun half-term holiday and give families the chance to book up to a two week-long break at cheaper rates than summer peak - when holidays are about 40 per cent more expensive.\nParents have described the plan as a 'brilliant' idea and said all schools across England and Wales should roll out the initiative.\nGemma Thomas said: 'If every school did this but chose a different week to other council areas it would be completely fantastic for families.'\nParents at the 485-pupil Eveswell Primary School in Newport, South Wales (pictured), have been told five days will be taken during one week in June next year, to allow them to book cheaper 'off-peak' summer holidays\nNot so lucky...
