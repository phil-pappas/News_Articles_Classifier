Constructed on a land of 50 acres, this is the single largest solar project which has been constructed in an airport in India. The project executed by Bosch Energy and Building Solutions (BEBS) team in India is estimated to generate approximately 50,000 units of electricity daily. Through this project, coupled with an earlier installed capacity of 1.1 MW, CIAL will technically become ‘grid power neutral’. Speaking about his experience of partnering with Bosch, Mr. V J Kurian, managing director of Cochin International Airport Limited, commented, “Bosch completed the project meticulously and we are happy to have the company execute this project on time and as per standards.”\n“Based on installed capacity, CIAL is the largest project which has been executed by the Bosch Energy and Building Solutions team in India till date. We draw strength from our broad based technical know-how and experience, pan-India presence and understanding of different regions in India, as well as strong local competence to deliver customized design and engineering projects. The combination of these factors helped us to resolve constraints imposed by on-site conditions,” said Dr. Steffen Berns, president of Bosch Group India and managing director Bosch Limited. “India has the potential to achieve the government’s ambitious target of 100 GW of solar power generation in the country by 2022 and Bosch is committed to be a part of this success story,” he further elaborated.\nCIAL the first airport in the world to be powered solely on solar power\nDesigned entirely in-house at Bosch, the project was driven by a dedicated engineering team and supported by full time quality and safety experts working onsite. The agile team ensured delivery within agreed timelines despite challenging requirements such as specific safety standards due to proximity to the airport or excessive rainfall. “Bosch Energy and Building Solutions is an integral part of the Bosch group. In India, the division is involved in executing solar PV-and energy efficiency projects. We have a pan-India presence and have executed projects across the country. Within 2 years, 50 MW of solar projects have been either commissioned or are in development. In future, we aim to further strengthen our presence in India,” said Mr. C M Venugopalan, Head of Bosch India Energy Business.\nSource:-CIAL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:01:48.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
