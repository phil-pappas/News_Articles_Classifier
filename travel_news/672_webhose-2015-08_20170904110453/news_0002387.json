This set includes the stroller, infant car seat, and the car seat base. The stroller fully reclines, and has a snack tray, as well as a spacious underneath basket & cup holder for parent on the top of the stroller. The stroller does show some signs of wear as it was used a decent amount with my son, but it is still in excellent condition and works properly. The car seat is in great shape, and has been stored appropriately. The car seat/base were never in an accident and they expire in August of 2018. The car seat holds an infant from 5 lbs to 30lbs. The seat does need to be cleaned a little bit after being in storage, but it buckles appropriately. Please text (or call) Ally if you are interested.
