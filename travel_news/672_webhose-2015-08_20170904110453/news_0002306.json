We don’t shout loud enough about our unique value proposition in our marketing and communications.” \n\nSherene said plans include strengthening public partnership with all private hospitals involved in medical tourism and do more collective marketing in key markets to promote Malaysia as a top-of-mind medical tourism destination. \n\nThese key markets include South-east Asia, the Middle East, China, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Kazakhstan. \n\nIn 2014, Malaysia earned RM730 million (US$191 million) in revenue from medical tourism and this year, the target is to reach RM1 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:08:41.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
