Also, visitors will learn about Oman Air’s network and flight schedules, and even be able to make bookings. In addition, a number of special events are being held, during which Oman Air gives away air tickets and other gifts to winners and participants. \nRecord number of flights \nNotably, Oman Air is operating a record number of flights between Muscat and Salalah over the summer months, enabling visitors to make the most of the Festival and enjoy the unique climate and scenery of the region. Between June and September, Oman Air will operate 284 return flights, representing an 11 per cent increase over 2014. This means that as many as 352,738 passengers will have the opportunity to fly with Oman Air to Salalah. \nThe Salalah Tourism Festival, which opened on July 22, celebrates the Khareef (monsoon season) when the southern-most tip of Oman is transformed from a dry desert to a lush green carpet. Visitors from around the world come to experience a vast range of events, which include music, sports, shooting, football, video games, as well as camel and horse rides. In addition, a new walkway has been built in the Dahariz area, which has seats shaded with umbrellas, a parking area and barbecue stations. \nUsama Al Haremi, Senior Manager - Corporate Communications and Media at Oman Air, commented, “Oman Air is proud to once again sponsor the Salalah Tourism Festival, confirming our commitment, not only to the event itself, but also to the Dhofar region and its people. \n“The majority of visitors to the Festival are expected to fly with Oman Air and we are pleased to have significantly increased the number of flights we offer between Muscat and Salalah. \n“Furthermore, visitors will be able to find out more about Oman Air’s products and services, make new bookings and change existing bookings at our dedicated Festival stall. “It is a pleasure for Oman Air to be contributing to the continuing success of the Salalah Tourism Festival. We would like to thank the organizers for their dedication, and the many thousands of visitors for making this year’s event bigger and better than ever before.” \nOman Air’s support for the Salalah Tourism Festival has continued since its inception and is an extension of the airline’s commitment to the city and its surrounding area.
