The 14-year-old festival fills streets with visual and performing arts and music meant to teach, inspire and agitate. More than a dozen resident artists will host visitors in their studios as well as mounting pop-up exhibits throughout the streets. Proceeds from a wine-tasting pavilion and a Friday night kick-off party starring blues guitarist Chris Cain (pictured at right) will raise funds for local youth-oriented nonprofits.\nVitals: Aug. 21-23; from 7 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday, noon-5 p.m. Sunday. Free admission; $10 wine tasting; $20-$25 kick-off party. (831) 372-1955. www.westendcelebration.com .\nWine tasting with Fido: Humans can enjoy fine food, wine and beer, live bluegrass music and mountain scenery without a trace of separation anxiety during the annual Peaks and Paws event at the Village at Squaw Valley. Dogs will be limited to water, but guided hikes, tasty treats, a pet-themed vendor village and activities geared toward canines provide ample compensation. Aug. 22, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. $5 suggested donation; food and drink prices vary. (800) 403-0206. www.squawalpine.com (select Events & Things to Do).\nL.A.’s top tacos: Los Angeles is one of the state’s best places to find a great taco, and the LA Taco Festival, which started five years ago in Boyle Heights, will bring the best of the best to downtown’s Grand Park this year. A benefit for homeless youth, the gathering features a nonstop music lineup, food trucks (and not just tacos) and other vendors. Bring lawn chairs, sunscreen and hearty appetites. Aug. 22, noon-7 p.m. Free admission; taco prices vary.
