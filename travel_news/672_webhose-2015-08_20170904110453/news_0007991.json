But an increasing body of evidence shows just how effective these mental work-outs can be, for everything from insomnia to depression. What exactly is mindfulness? And do you have to sit cross-legged on the floor chanting for it to count as meditation? Not according to Andy Puddicombe, who trained to be a Buddhist monk and then decided to demystify meditation and make it relevant and accessible to as many people as possible. He founded a company called Headspace, spawning the hugely popular Headspace app, which now has almost three million users. “We define mindfulness as the intention to be present in the here and now, fully engaged in whatever is happening, free from distraction or judgement, with a soft and open mind,” he says. “Meditation is an exercise in familiarising yourself with the qualities of mindfulness. It helps optimise conditions for training the mind to be calmer, clearer and kinder.” And while there are many different forms of meditation, the simplest require you to just sit still, close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Once you’ve learned this ability to focus, it can help you put things into perspective. It’s not necessarily about getting to the point where you can clear your mind, or stop thinking or feeling. It’s more about changing how we relate to our thoughts. So rather than reacting to every single thought or emotional impulse, we can observe our thoughts in a more objective fashion. The benefits, says Puddicombe, are huge. Mindfulness can benefit every area of your life – from your relationships to work, to sex, to exercise. It’s even helpful for giving up smoking “Mindfulness can benefit every area of your life – from your relationships to work, to sex, to exercise. It’s even helpful for giving up smoking. Some of the most popular reasons for learning meditation and mindfulness are for reducing stress and anxiety in order to sleep better – but learning to be mindful really does benefit every single area of your life.” Anthony Seldon, the headmaster of Wellington College, has lobbied for it to be included on the school syllabus, arguing that “mindfulness or meditation has been shown to be an invaluable tool to help bolster young people’s resilience to psychological stress”. Crucially, more and more research supports the medical endorsement of mindfulness. Availability differs from area to area, but mindfulness courses – usually weekly sessions conducted by a clinical psychologist over an eight-week period – are available on the NHS, and, after recent studies, could become as likely to be prescribed as anti-depressants. Earlier this year, in a trial published in The Lancet , mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was shown to be as good as pills when it came to preventing relapses after major bouts of depression. Combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioural therapy helps people recognise that they might have negative feelings, but enables them to understand that they don’t have to be affected by them. If this approach can successfully be used to address serious illnesses, imagine the impact it could have on your personal wellbeing. As Andy Puddicombe puts it: ‘‘Meditation is simple to incorporate into your everyday existence but substantial enough to change your experience of life. The benefits are physical, emotional and mental. \"If you want more peace of mind, better sleep, to be more productive at work, to feel happier or to have better relationships, meditation can help.” How to take your first steps to mindfulness • Download an app There are lots of apps, but Headspace is a good place to start.
