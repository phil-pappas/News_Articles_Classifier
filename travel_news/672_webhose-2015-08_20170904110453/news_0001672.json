Thursday August 13, 2015 Print Article \nCan you imagine MLTR going on vacation together? We can't. — TODAY pic SINGAPORE, Aug 13 — On stage, Michael Learns To Rock can croon and sing their way into the hearts of thousands of women, with well-loved tunes such as \"25 Minutes\", \"Paint My Love\", \"The Actor\" and \"Sleeping Child\". \nBut when they are not at work, lead singer Jascha Richter, drummer Kare Wanscher and guitarist Mikkel Lentz are just regular family men with their own quirky habits. \nShortly before their sold-out concert at The Star Performing Arts Centre in Singapore, the band discussed their travel habits during an interview at Grand Park Orchard Hotel — including their favourite items to take on the road when they go on tour. \nWhile Wanscher says he would always take along historical novels and biographies on his e-book reader, bandmate Lentz prefers to borrow his daughter’s cap. \n“She has a pink cap that I use when I am in the sun and when I am outside,” said Lentz. “A lot of people find it funny, and I have tried to find another one that is a little more trendy, but they don’t fit! I like to wear (my daughter’s pink hat), but she is so embarrassed back home when I put it on. I always take it on the road, and it is nice to think of her as well. And you can see it’s me from a distance.” \n“I have this little box with ear plugs,” Richter said. “I can put them in my ears, so the level of sound will be very much reduced. I use them all the time, and actually, when I went for a walk here in Singapore, I had to use them. There is so much noise!” \nQ: Can you tell us which parts of Denmark are your favourites? \nKare Wanscher: There are several parts of Copenhagen that I really enjoy — the part of town called Vesterbro. It’s very central and very close to a railway station. It used to be the dirty red-light district, but it’s changed into a Berlin-like neighbourhood with a lot of bars and cafes, and a lot of shops with anything from used clothing to small galleries and small coffee bars. \nMikkel Lentz: If you go to Denmark, it is hard to pick out a place that is not in the guidebooks. But there is a place that is a pub in Skagen, the most Nordic city in Denmark. It is a very nice pub where only the locals — the fishermen — go. So if you really want to see fishermen, go to Havne Cafe. My wife is from there, so she knows the place, otherwise I would never go there. It is my little recommendation for tourists. \nQ: You guys travel so frequently and such long distances. Can you give us a tip on how to look like superstars after a long flight? \nML: We don’t (look good)! That is why sunglasses were invented. We just put them on so nobody can see. \nQ: What is the strangest thing you’ve discovered about each other? \nML: The strangest thing about Kare is that he does the plank every morning. \nKW: For about three to four minutes. \nML: He just rolls over on the bed and (does the plank). (Laughs) \nKW: Mikkel can actually — even though we are in beautiful, sunny Asia, with nice swimming pools where you can have cold champagne — he can stay in his room all day. \nML: With my pink cap. \nKW: With his pink cap on, and nothing else. \nML: Yes, but it depends, especially if I am jetlagged, or if the travel has been very tough, like (if we have spent) 24 hours on the road. I really just unplug and rest and read books and watch movies and relax for one or two days. \nQ: What about Jascha? \nKW: Jascha, you just never know where he is. He always walks on his own, somewhere in town, with his ear plugs. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:27:52.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
