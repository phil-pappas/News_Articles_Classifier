My dad and I have been to hundreds of games together. So I was excited about my trip to Cuba. I fervently hoped to have some baseball interaction along the way of our controlled, guided tour.\nAs we rode along in our bus, manufactured in China, we saw lots of grass fields with children practicing, lots of stadiums for the national teams, lots of statues of interesting mascots. Baseballs and bats were for sale in almost every craft market.\nThen one day, on our way back to the hotel from the charming old town of Trinidad, our driver, Isidro, suddenly pulled onto the shoulder of the road, got off the bus, and started a conversation with someone. Hey, this is Cuba - you learn quickly to be flexible and go with the flow. Little did we expect what was to come our way.\nThe unassuming man Isidro had stopped to talk to was El Gigante del Escambray. Antonio Munoz. In Phillies terms, the Mike Schmidt of Cuba.\nMore coverage Personal Journey: Enroute to the sea, a wrong turn up mountain Personal Journey: Dropping in on the Andes in Ecuador Personal Journey: Warsaw is worth the trip Munoz came aboard the bus, ecstatic to talk to a group of Americans. He regaled us with stories of his career. There was a trip to the 1975 Pan American games, a hitting record of .535, 370 home runs, 1,281 RBIs, 24 seasons' worth of shining moments. But for me, the shiniest of the moments was yet to come.\nWhen Americans travel to Cuba, they are required to keep journals of their activities. Mine went from the mundane, rice-and-beans-again-with-dinner to the emotionally moving - shaking hands with a Cuban military veteran. This day, though, marked the most important item in my journal.\nIn a fit of unabashed idol worship, I handed my journal and a pen to Munoz. He signed my journal. Then I got a huge hug and kiss to top it off. My Cuban experience was complete!\nNow, if only I can find a bus driver who is friends with Mike Schmidt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T01:44:56.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
