YouTube Video \nResort Release BBB Torch Award Nomination Video. Resort Release has helped to relieve thousands of people from their burdensome and unwanted timeshare contracts. ROCKFORD, IL, August 19,   Resort Release , the nation's foremost timeshare exit company, was recently nominated for the prestigious Better Business Bureau Torch Award for marketplace ethics. Resort Release serves as the official direct-to-consumer enrollment office of American Resource Management Group, LLC - the first Better Business Bureau accredited timeshare release company in the state of Illinois. Every year the Better Business Bureau rewards one local business with this prestigious award. The Torch award is given to businesses that display support for industry best practices and a solid commitment to day-to-day ethical business operations. All recipients of this award must first be nominated by a client or customer, and then reviewed by a panel of BBB judges. Should Resort Release win the prestigious Torch Award, they would be the first timeshare exit company to ever do so. For years Resort Release has helped to relieve thousands of people from their burdensome and unwanted timeshare contracts. Resort Release reviews all potential customers' timeshares under strict acceptance guidelines before taking them on for their guaranteed release services. With a tsunami of timeshare owners looking for a safe and reliable way to exit their timeshare - Resort Release is poised to be the single voice of help this upcoming maintenance fee season. Resort Release recently made industry headlines by being the first company to offer Two 100% Money Back Guarantees on their timeshare exit services. If a customer is not legally and permanently ridded of their timeshare, the customer will receive all of their money back. Their guarantee is simple; you either get timeshare free, or you pay nothing for the services. These attributes paired with an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, are put in place to give customers an added layer of protection and peace of mind. One recent client of Resort Release was so pleased with their quality of service that they took the liberty of contacting the BBB and submitting the torch nomination. A letter from the BBB was later delivered to Resort Release containing the following message. \"Congratulations! American Resource Management Group has been nominated to enter into the Better Business Bureau's prestigious 2016 Torch Award for Marketplace Ethics by an individual who believed your company should be publicly recognized for its day-to-day ethical business practices.\" Only one business from Northern Illinois will be awarded the prestigious torch award and winning this award would be another huge accomplishment for Resort Release.
