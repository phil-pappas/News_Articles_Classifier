The rooms are comforting and comfortable, the staff is charming and accommodating. I do wish, though, they would tone down the hype. \n\nNamed \"Best City Hotel in Scotland\" in the 2015 Scottish Hotel Awards, the Nira Caledonia occupies three Georgian townhouses in a northern stretch of Edinburgh's New Town known as Stockbridge. The Grade I listed building once belonged to Christopher North, nom de plume of John Wilson, a noted 19th century hedonist, bon viveur and figure in the Edinburgh literary scene. This information is useful to help taxi drivers find the place. The Nira Caledonia, a relative Edinburgh newcomer, shares part of its name with another Edinburgh luxury hotel that's something of a landmark. \nThe hotel is located on a quiet residential street, amid green garden squares. Its decor is a kind of glamorous hybrid that reflects is owners' Asia Pacific roots. Modern Asian (laquered chests, tables and cabinets with wrought metal hinges and handles, ginger jars and ginger jar lamps), and traditional British luxe (leather Chesterfield sofa , heavy draft beating draperies on the tall windows). Even its name is that kind of hybrid - Nira is derived from the Sanskrit word for pure and Caledonia was the Roman name for Scotland. Grand proportions mean lots of steps to climb \nTypical of the neoclassical and Georgian architecture of the late 18th to mid 19th centuries, the three joined town houses have high ceilings and spacious rooms. The modern bathroom in my \"suite\" (more a very large, double-sized room than a suite in any real sense) was equally well proportioned. The high ceilings and oversized rooms make for long staircases. These being listed buildings, no lift (elevator) can be installed. And, as there are no easily accessible ground floor rooms, this is not a hotel for anyone with mobility issues. \nThe main entrance is rather awkward as well. The reception desk is directly inside the door of the narrow building with very little space between the counter and the wall. The result creates a logjam of guests and luggage if one party is trying to check in while another is trying to leave. In bad weather - as in the day I arrived - it can be difficult to get in out of the wind and rain. Perhaps some thought should be given to rearranging that area. \nYou don't have to worry about portaging your heavy luggage up the stairs. The very helpful staff will do that for you. Still, after an exhausting day hiking up and down Edinburgh's many steep hills and then navigating downhill from Princes Street, then uphill and then downhill again to the Nira Caledonia, I did find that last flight of steps to my room almost a stretch too many. If you are going to stay this far north in the Old Town and you are not relatively fit, plan on budgeting for a lot of taxis. A word with housekeeping please \nOverall, I found the staff at the Nira Caledonia helpful and friendly. But I do have a couple of quibbles. I arrived soaked to the skin on a rainy day only to find the hairdryer in my room broken. On another day, I left a few things to dry on the heated towel rail. Hours later, after the room had been done up, I found lovely, fluffy fresh towels on the heated towel rail. But one of my laundered items had been shoved and crumpled at the end of the rail - ending up still wet with heat set creases - and the other had been tidied away on a door hook, under a damp terry bathrobe, leaving me without a clean, try shirt for dinner. Perhaps housekeeper training should include the application of a little common sense. Dining at the Nira Caledonia \nThe hotel's restaurant, Blackwoods Bar and Grill, has a small, stand-up bar with one or two tables (plus a huge selection of Scotch whiskies) and a dining room that is only marginally larger. I generally try to avoid hotel dining rooms, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of fairly priced grilled meats, seafood, Scottish specialities and vegetarian choices. All grilled selections are prepared on a Josper Grill - a charcoal fueled combination of oven and enclosed barbecue grill that has become le dernier cri in restaurant circles these days. \nScotland's boosters promoted 2015 as Scotland's Year of Food and Drink and the menu was heavy on locally produced ingredients with a Scottish pedigree. Starters, ranging in price from £6 to £9 (in 2015) included carpaccio of grass and heather fed \"Highland Drovers\" beef, seared Isle of Mull scallops (my choice and lovely), Shetland mussels and Dunkeld smoked salmon. \nMains, ranging in price from £15 for two vegetarian options, through £28 for about 8oz of filet steak, feature a variety of beef, pork and lamb chops, salmon, lobster and Scottish sea bass . With all the hoopla over the special grill oven, it seemed a shame not to try it, so I had a pair of Jacob rare breed lamb cutlets - perfectly pink under a nice crisply charred exterior. \nFor afters, I tried a selection of Scottish cheeses from Edinburgh's famous cheese monger I.J. Mellis , served with traditional oatcakes and quince jelly. It was a shame, given the focus on pedigree for every mouthful (there's even a 24 page, card-bound booklet to tell you all about it), that none of the wait staff could name the cheeses they served or produce the right cutlery to eat them with. \nThe wine list is short and uncontroversial with several whites and reds available by the glass. \nThe verdict to be perfectly honest, you are not going to have an unforgettable evening at Blackwoods at the Nira Caledonia. This is a conservative menu, packed with \"old standards\". But the quality of the ingredients and the preparation are very good. I wouldn't make a beeline for this restaurant if staying elsewhere. But as a dinner option while staying at this somewhat out of the way hotel, it rises well above the typical hotel dining room. About that hype \nAll over the hotel, including in the guest rooms, there are expensively produced brochures and booklets declaring - \"Pleasure is not a state of being - it is the primordial purpose of the soul...\" \"There is a place for eclectic design and ever-so-subtle eroticism\" (That must have been the black velour slippers, then) And, my favorite,\"To us, true hospitality is about 'your way,' a touch of our hand and the passion that binds the two. It is about the creation of hedonistic havens, where all manner of whims and desires are indulged.\" Really? I must have found the wrong room. \nWhole forests of trees had been slaughtered to suggest that somehow I had stumbled into a setting for Fifty Shades of Grey. Someone needs to get a grip on the marketing team because this hotel can stand on its own without so much silly bumph.
