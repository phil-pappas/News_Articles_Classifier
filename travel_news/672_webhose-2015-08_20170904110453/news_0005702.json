The movie built around ABBA songs about a daughter's quest to figure out just who her father is hadn't even come out yet in many countries when questions about just where Mamma Mia was shot in Greece were pouring in based on the trailer. If you're wondering where Mamma Mia was shot so you can plan your own trip to Greece, here's help. Mamma Mia Movie Locations Pictures Check out some of the locations where the Mamma Mia film was shot in Greece.\nPelion Region - Damouchari Here's a brief account, with pictures but in Greek, of the Mamma Mia shoot in Damouchari with some candid photos from the Mamma Mia set. Some of the Damouchari footage was used at the beginning of Mamma Mia when Christine Baranski and Julie Walters arrive on the island and are met by Meryl Streep . It was combined with images shot on Skopelos. The article below shows a shot of the beach at Damouchari, which leads to where the scenes in Mamma Mia were shot. The beach is sometimes called \"Blue Beach\". The Daily Mail covered Damouchari and its Mamma Mia connections in detail: \"The Greek Jewel Where ABBA Meets a Donkey Named Boy George\" and includes information on the crew hotel, Hotel Damouchari. \nOn Skopelos - Mamma Mia was shot at: Kastani Bay and beach, where \"Does Your Mother Know\" was performed Agios Ioannis Prodromos Monastery for the wedding chapel Amarantos Nisi The beach and cliffs above Glisteri (Glysteri). \nThe producers say a \"mountainous peninsula\" near Glisteri was used as the filming location where Sophie leaves for her wedding. A cliff on this same peninsula was used for the cliff jumping scene with Sophie and her potential fathers. They picnicked on a beach south of Agnondas off of the Stafylos road. \nThe official Mamma Mia Movie website reports that the movie cast and crew stayed at the Skopelos Village Hotel, the Prince Stafylos Hotel, the Adrina Hotel, and the Aeolia Hotel. Some of the stars rented villas nearby instead. Restaurants used by the cast and crew included Agioli, Tis Annas, To Perivoli, The Garden, and Agnanti. \nSkiathos - Some fine-sand beaches on Skiathos were used for scenes in Mamma Mia. The port where the three fathers meet for the first time is the Old Port on Skiathos. The area around the St. Nikolaos Bell Tower was where Sophie mailed her letters though that shot was a composite and you won't find exactly the same view. It is reported that the cast and crew stayed at the Skiathos Princess Hotel, the Skiathos Palace Hotel, and the Mandraki, and dined at Skiathos restaurants including Asprolithos, Polikratis, Sophia's Place, and the Windmill. \nVilla Donna was placed on the cliffs above Glysteri Beach on Skopelos. But most of the Villa Donna scenes were shot back at the studio and married to Greek backgrounds later - only the stone gateway survives. But when the dancers go through olive groves, those groves are a long way off - they were shot at Douchari in the Mouresi area of Greece, along the Pelion Coast outside of Volos. \nCorfu (Kerkyra) - Agios Ioannis Chapel. This Mamma Mia location has been reported in several sources, but I didn't see any Corfu in the film. The chapel seen in the movie is definitely on Skopelos. See below for more on the absence of Corfu in the film. \nMamma Mia Movie Locations Pictures - See the stars on location in Greece. \nYiannis Chatzitrakosas at Skopelos Web has provided me with some more details on Mamma Mia film locations: \n\"Kalokairi is Skopelos! The opening \"Mailbox Scene\" in Mamma Mia is a composite shot. It's shot at the entrance of Skiathos village. The post letter box on the bottom half of the screen with the white stone and the back view is from Skopelos village and the sea view is from Skiathos! The island at the back is the beautiful small island of Tsougrias which has great beaches accessible from Skiathos, which is the island that the Beatles wanted to buy in the 1970s.\" \nYiannis goes on to say \"The three actors' first appearance in Mamma Mia is from the Nisi area near Glisteri beach and in back you can see Sarres beach Area on Skopelos, Ai Giorgis, and Alonissos island .\" \nThanks, Yiannis. \nBelinda \"Bill\" Farmer, who lives and blogs on Corfu says that the Mamma Mia producers scouted locations on Corfu , but no Corfu locations were filmed. She also has an inside source: Julie Walters is a friend, who told her that no Corfu locations were used in Mamma Mia.
