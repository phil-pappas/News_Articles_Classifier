We are also looking forward to welcoming visitors from Israel to the UK.” \nYariv Levin, Israel’s minister of tourism, added: “I am delighted that Monarch Airlines is launching new scheduled services to Israel this December. \n“This is a great indication that Israel has the support of major carriers, such as Monarch, and will allow for even greater choice and accessibility for international travellers. \n“By signing the Open Skies Agreement in 2013, we have paved the way to form this partnership with Monarch.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T07:23:08.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
