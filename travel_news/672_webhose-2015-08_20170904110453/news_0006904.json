Whether you choose to continue your formal education or look to enter the work place, apprenticeships should feature in your options. Apprenticeships combine the best of both worlds: academic qualifications and on-the-job experience, all while earning a wage and getting one foot on the career ladder.”\nKaren has compiled some top tips for those applying for apprenticeships with the airline:\n• What are the 3 most important things you look for on an application?\nA well-presented application is always an indication that the candidate has carefully considered the position – it’s always worth checking that your application is grammatically correct and all the questions have been answered to the fullest. We also asses an individual’s motivation for joining a British Airways apprenticeship programme and their willingness to learn. And thirdly, a candidate should demonstrate that they have the appropriate skills, qualifications and personal qualities to suit the demands of the position.\n• How can candidates outshine the rest?\nWe understand that those applying for apprenticeships may not necessarily have had prior work experience but it is beneficial for candidates to be able to demonstrate that they have worked as part of a team, have experience of assisting others and have been committed to extra-curricular activities in the past – whether this be as part of a sports team, volunteering work or a Saturday job. Ultimately, we will be impressed by candidates who are motivated, passionate about the role and can demonstrate their commitment to delivering excellent customer service.\nLyle Dalgleish (18) from Berkshire, is currently on British Airways’ two-year Head Office apprentice programme. He said: “After completing my GCSEs, I didn’t feel continuing at school was the right choice for my development. I looked at apprenticeships because I liked the fact you can earn while you learn, and I chose British Airways because there is so much opportunity for progression. My one piece of advice for anyone considering an apprenticeship is – don’t hesitate, but do your research.”\nBritish Airways will welcome more than 200 apprentices this year and is set to recruit a similar number next year.\nSource:- British Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:13:48.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
