Outrageous. The city also hopes to address cultural conflicts arising from differences in lifestyles, according to an official memo on the website .\nKyoto City has worked with TripAdvisor to create \"AKiMaHen (Don'ts) of Kyoto,\" a leaflet aimed at visitors.\nThe leaflet is topped with an illustration of five grumpy-looking Kyotoites captioned, \"Kyotoites are pretty fastidious!\"\nEach impolite act gets an \"AKiMaHen\" rating from one mildly unhappy emoticon to three red, fiercely angry faces.\nSome of the least unacceptable behaviors are tipping -- how dare you! -- and opening taxi doors by yourself.\nTaxi doors in Japan are opened and closed remotely by taxi drivers.\nThe most serious offenses include smoking outdoors in non-designated areas -- punishable by a fine of 1,000 yen ($8).\nBicycling while drunk carries a whopping penalty of up to one million yen ($8,000) or five years in prison.\nOther tips include being polite when asking a maiko (an apprentice dancer who wears a traditional kimono) for pictures and not canceling restaurant reservations at the last minute.\nIt's the second part in an Insider Guide series.\nThe first part focuses on facts and tips about Kyoto.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-large-169.jpg", "http://tg.tripadvisor.jp/", "http://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/sankan/cmsfiles/contents/0000186/186286/TG106_WEB_engKYO.jpg", "http://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/sankan/page/0000186286.html", "http://tg.tripadvisor.jp/kyototourism/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-small-169.jpg", "http://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/sankan/cmsfiles/contents/0000185/185184/%28keiji%29youshiki.pdf", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-small-11.jpg", "http://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/sankan/page/0000185184.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150828122159-kyoto-manner-tip-taxi-exlarge-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-28T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T02:56:02.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
