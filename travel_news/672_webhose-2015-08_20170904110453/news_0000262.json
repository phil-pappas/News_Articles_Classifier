In a nod to the 30th Anniversary of the Back to the Future film trilogy, they’ve actually developed a working version of the “hoverboard” protagonist Marty McFly careens his way through fictional future 2015 in BTTF 2.\nAfter a couple of teases, Lexus just released a video that finally shows the hoverboard in action at a facility in Cubelles, Barcelona, fully venting special effects-like steam and in fact being suspended in air. At the helm is professional skateboarder Ross MacGouran, who mostly falls a great deal before seeming to get the hang of it, at least for modest periods. As we noted a week or so ago, actually riding and controlling a hoverboard would be considerably more difficult than riding a wheeled skateboard, given the complex nature of physics and stuff.\nThere is one impressive maneuver, however, in which MacGouran manages to make the leap across a ramp and over a snappy new Lexus GS-F sports sedan that just happens to be driving beneath it. The video also shows the wheeled wizard riding the hoverboard over water, something even Marty was unable to accomplish in the movie.\n“I’ve spent 20 years skateboarding, but without friction it feels like I’ve had to learn a whole new skill, particularly in the stance and balance in order to ride the hoverboard,” McGouran says. We’re featuring the complete “SLIDE” video, created by award winning director Henry-Alex Rubin, at the end of this post.\nNow we’d be eating an extra-large helping of crow for all our spewed skepticism heaped upon the project throughout the last two posts, but the key here is the fact that the skatepark shown in the video was specially constructed using around 200 meters of magnet-infused track. Lexus’ hoverboard, it seems, won’t operate over the usual concrete and/or asphalt surfaces found at most such facilities. That’s because it comes “powered” by a pair of so-called cryostats, which are reservoirs containing superconducting material, kept at a frigid -197 degrees Fahrenheit courtesy of liquid hydrogen, with the latter accounting for all the steam emanating from the unit.\nAs explained by Dr. Oliver de Haas, CEO of evico GmbH, a company participating in the venture that specializes in magnetic levitation technology: “The magnetic field from the track is effectively ‘frozen’ into the superconductors in the board, maintaining the distance between the board and the track – essentially keeping the board hovering. This force is strong enough to allow the rider to stand and even jump on the board.”\nAs for aesthetics, the hoverboard sports its own version of the automaker’s spindle-shaped grille and is trimmed in assorted materials shared with conventional Lexus vehicles, including natural bamboo. Still, though the original hoverboards in BTTW 2 carried the Mattel brand name, don’t expect to find anything like Lexus’ version for sale in sporting goods shops or toy stores any time soon.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:08:39.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
