The assembled set of questions can be used to inspire the design of future transit surveys. What Do Americans Think about Public Transit? A Review of U.S. Public Opinion Polling Survey Questions is published by the Mineta Transportation Institute (MTI). The author was Asha Weinstein Agrawal, PhD. The report is available for free download at http://transweb.sjsu.edu/project/1132.html \"Our objective was to help future researchers and transit planners,\" said Dr. Agrawal. \"We did this by identifying a large set of polls asking people their opinions about public transit, assembling a bank of questions that can help generate ideas for wording future questions, and summarizing the results of relevant poll questions to assess the state of public opinion about transit.\"Dr. Agrawal found that the surveys most commonly included questions on four themes: the reasons people support public transit; opinions about transit service quality; the extent to which people support improving transit as a general concept; and support levels for raising additional revenues to support transit. Analysis of the responses to the poll questions found that strong majorities of people believe that transit brings a number of specific benefits to their community, especially congestion relief and accessibility for vulnerable residents. Strong majorities also support improvements to transit as a general concept. However, Dr. Agrawal also found that support for transit as a concept did not always translate into support for increasing revenues for transit. \"Less than half of people support the general concept of increased spending on transit, and considerably fewer than half support raising any specific tax to increase transit funding, except for sales taxes, which usually enjoy majority support.\" 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:31:39.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
