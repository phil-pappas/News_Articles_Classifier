The flight attendants will now adapt their service more strongly towards the rhythm of their passengers in order to individually respond to their guests' needs and requests just like a top-class restaurant. After the flight attendants have welcomed 'their' guests on board in person and by name, they take their orders and set the table with ceramic crockery. Meals are then served directly from the galley. Trays and flight trolleys are replaced by service plates. \nAfter the introductory flights in June and July on the Airbus A380 routes to New York (JFK) and Miami, the restaurant service will now be launched on the A380 services to Houston, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, Miami, Delhi, New York (JFK), Beijing, San Francisco, Shanghai, Seoul and Singapore from 1st August onwards. The service will then be introduced on flights with the Boeing 747-400 and 747-8 from Frankfurt on 1st October and the Airbus A340 fleet from Frankfurt and Munich to Asia and the Middle East on 25th October. \nSpecial service training courses for around 4500 flight attendants have already been running since May this year. The around 130 flights on which the new concept has already been tested received an extremely positive response from Business Class guests. With its new restaurant service, Lufthansa is taking another important step towards becoming the first five-star airline in the Western hemisphere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T22:34:43.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
