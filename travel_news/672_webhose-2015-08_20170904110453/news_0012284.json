On neglected land, bricks are partly buried under thick moss and tree leaves, obviously part of the walls and foundation of a small building that once stood here in Thung Tuk on Kho Khao island in the Takua Pa district of Phangnga Province. \nWhite-water rafting is a popular activity on Song Phraek Canal. A local dam opens its water gate once a day to feed fruit orchards situated along the waterway. This benefits tour operators, allowing them to organise white-water rafting. There are two big operators that have their own dams for private groups. \n\"Look for beads while roaming around. You may get one. It is easier to find beads after the rain washes over the soil surface,\" says Rung-Suriya Piyathamrong-Rojana, the owner of C&N Ko Kor Khao Beach Resort as she walks slowly over the plain that was once was an ancient town that can be dated back more than a thousand years ago. \nImages of beautiful ancient jewellery beads pop into my mind as I slowly explore the site. However, my lack of luck means I don't find any. \nAfter a while, Rung-Suriya walks along the sandy ground to the foundations of yet another building, most probably a small religious site with an altar base in the middle. \n\"Besides beads in various shapes and colours, remains of broken earthenware, Persian coloured glass containers as well as Indian coins have also been discovered scattered along the ground at Thung Tuk,\" he said, furthermore stating that archaeologists had found that Thung Tuk was once was a port town. \nIts peaceful bay serves as a storm shelter and its weather means it was once an ideal place for Indian and Malay merchants to stay. Moreover, Thung Tuk was the gateway for a short cut to the Gulf of Thailand. In ancient times, goods were carried great lengths along the Takua Pa River and then transported by carts or porters across hills to the Don Sak district of Surat Thani. \nTropical pitcher plants found in Kho Khao demonstrate how some areas are untouched and far from tourists. \n\"It should be a busy port town. However, Kho Khao is now pretty quiet and peaceful. There are 800 registered people on this island, but the actual population is only 300,\" said Rung-Suriya, talking about his adopted hometown which he moved to just over 10 years ago. \nHe drives me through the wilderness and neglected land. After tin mining came to an end some 20 years ago, with the dramatic drop of tin prices, people moved to other towns for new jobs and the island fell into a long silence, especially during the seasons of the monsoon. A handful of tourists make visits here when summer arrives and the empty beaches get turned into peaceful places to enjoy. \nPhangnga is modest and relaxing, especially when compared to neighbouring Phuket. Despite its empty beaches, the province remains rich with its own easy atmosphere and wilderness. An amazing place to see in Phangnga is the Song Phreak Canal, in Thap Pud district, where tourists engage in white-water rafting. \nMost tourists come to Phangnga for its beaches. But some also enjoy rafting here. It is different from other places as instead of waiting for adequate water levels during particular periods of the year, rafting operators keep spare water in dams and release it whenever they want. Quiet streams then all of a sudden turn into level-3 rafting routes. \nSo do not be surprised if, when you are relaxing by a peaceful cascading canal stream, you then all of a sudden hear excited tourists screaming on rubber rafts as they pass by on a fierce stream. \nAnother peaceful place tourists like to visit is Thai Muang Beach in Thai Muang district. The sandy beach stretches along for kilometres and faces the Andaman Sea. I love spending days here enjoying what would seem to be a neglected paradise. \nOn the beach road, the Phangnga Coastal Fisheries Research and Development Centre is also worthy of a visit. It is home to various marine organisms, for instance giant clams, green turtles, hawksbill turtles and clown fish. Tourists are allowed to freely roam and watch the newly-hatched turtles swimming in the enclosures. \nThere are a handful of local restaurants that serve very good seafood dishes. Among them is I-Talay which comes with a menu of great variety. For the health conscious, the oval sea grape (Caulopa macrophysa) is a new dish found on most menus. They are in many dishes such as spicy salads, sushi and sashimi served fresh with chilli paste. \nThe sunset dyes the Phangnga sky with a violet hue and a peaceful atmosphere fills up the ocean. Make a visit and you may find that you enjoy this easy-going province. \nA tourist is exploring the remains of an ancient building foundation in Ban Thung Tuk, Ko Kho Khao. Many archaeologists believe Tung Tuk may even be the renowned \"Takkola\" town, a large ancient port town which can be dated back to over 1,600 years ago. There is clear evidence that suggest the buildings and artefacts have influences derived from India. Pendants and beads have also been regularly found. \nA fully-opened giant clam in Phangnga Coastal Fisheries Research and Development Centre. Each giant clam has a unique pattern, like that of each human fingerprint. The shells can grow up to 115cm and the weight of the shells and soft parts can reach above 300kg. In Thailand, Giant clams are on the endangered list and anyone who possesses them, even just their shells, will be fined 20,000 baht. \nThere are many tour operators offering bamboo rafting for tourists to get a glimpse of the Phangnga jungle in a peaceful atmosphere. Be advised that a narrated tour is unlikely as most of the staff are Burmese and do not speak a second language. \nVisitors greet Olive Ridley turtles at the Phangnga Coastal Fisheries Research and Development Centre which has a turtle hatchery. Visitors who make donations of around 2,500 baht can adopt a turtle that gets a positioning chip installed under its skin before it is released back into the sea. \nWater buffaloes make their way along a plain which was once an airfield, stretching for kilometres on the western side of Kho Khao. The locals say the Japanese army built this airfield right at the beginning of World War II, probably in preparation for attacking Myanmar. Only one aircraft was ever landed here and the airfield has not been used since.
