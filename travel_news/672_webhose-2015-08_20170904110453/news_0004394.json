The players are accompanied by Australian New Zealander artist Stan Walker, winner of “Australian Idol”. Actor Rip Torn, who played the role of Agent Z in the original film, also stars as the same character. \nThe short film will be screened in all planes of the airline’s fleet. \nAir New Zealand is not the first airline to modernize in-flight safety procedures. In the spring, Air France launched its own spot under the new slogan “France is in the air”, full of humour and French glamour. — AFP-Relaxnews \nThe All Blacks are transformed into agents from ‘Men in Black’ for Air New Zealand. — AFP pic More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T09:08:00.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
