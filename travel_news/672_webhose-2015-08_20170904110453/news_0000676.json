Foreign tourist numbers see big dip Article By: Megan Ellis Tue, 04 Aug 2015 8:36 AM Share Your Email A file image of passport stamps. Credit: Megan Ellis \nThe latest report from Statistics SA has shown yet another significant dip in foreign tourist arrivals. \nThe latest statistics are from a year-on-year comparison for foreign tourist arrivals in April 2014 and April 2015. \nAccording to StatsSA, foreign arrivals decreased by 10.6%, from 1 308 531 in April 2014 to 1 169 290 in April 2015. \nBetween March and April 2015, there was also a decrease in foreign arrivals. Foreign visitors decreased by 5.4% between March and April, from 1 235 571 to 1 169 290. \nThe dip comes on top of the decline that was already seen in Q1 2015. \nTourism Minister Derek Hanekom has spoken out about the dip in tourism numbers, confirming that there has been a drop and that this decline is in part due to the visa laws implemented in October 2014. \nThe impact of the child visa laws which were implemented on June 1, 2015, has not yet been confirmed by a StatsSA report. These results should be released later this year. \nHowever, industry experts believe the impact will be seriously detrimental to the tourism sector. \nResearch done by Grant Thornton reported an expected R1.4-billion loss in direct tourism spend in 2015, with a R4.1-billion loss to the country's GDP.
