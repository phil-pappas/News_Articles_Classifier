Our focus is on giving the country an airline that will be a strong competitive force in the region, worthy of flying the national flag,” said Captain Than Tun, Chief Executive Officer of MNA. “Bolstered by the partnership with Amadeus, this deal is a critical element in our plan enabling us to provide increased access to our beautiful country for millions of visitors across the world.”\nIn June 2015, MNA received the first in a series of new, state-of-the-art Boeing Next-Generation 737s joining its fleet. The first arrival is one of six Boeing Next-Generation 737-800s and four 737-Max 8s that MNA has ordered as part of a multi-million dollar strategy to re-invigorate its brand and signal the re-emergence of Myanmar as a competitive member of the global aviation market. On top of this, the airline will also add six brand new ATR 72-600s to its domestic aircraft fleet, with the first two planes arriving this year.\nThe agreement means Amadeus travel agents worldwide will now have guaranteed access to MNA’s full range fares, to support growing demand for travel to and within Myanmar. MNA joins 478 airlines globally whose content is available on the Amadeus system.\n“Myanmar National Airlines has shown real commitment to build on its extensive history and experience in serving travellers in Myanmar and we are delighted they have chosen to partner with us to support their transformation and growth. Our technology will enable travel agents worldwide to book MNA flights easily and seamlessly. This agreement underlines our commitment to bringing the widest possible range of airline content to the Amadeus global network, and at the same time offer MNA unparalleled access to travel agents globally,” added Hazem Hussein, Executive Vice President, Airline Commercial, Amadeus Asia Pacific.\nMNA’s growing international routes will link to 26 domestic destinations – the most of any airline in Myanmar – with its Yangon-Singapore route launching on 17 August 2015 and growing to four more cities in the Asia Pacific region by early 2016. Now, more people will have the opportunity to discover this exceptional country as it welcomes the world through a growing network of international destinations.\nSource:-MNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:05:43.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
