This Fatigue Risk Management System includes policy and practice changes, along with fatigue education to raise awareness about the personal responsibilities associated with managing fatigue.\nSome of the changes the FAA has made as part of the Fatigue Risk Management System include:\nAllowing for recuperative breaks when no duties are assigned\nRequiring nine hours off duty where a day shift follows an evening shift\nRequiring positive confirmation of air traffic hand-offs during midnight operations\nRestricting consecutive midnight shifts\nRestricting 10-hour midnight shifts\nRestricting the start time of early morning day shifts that precede a midnight shift\nAllowing controllers to self-declare fatigue and take time off if needed to recuperate\nHas the FAA’s policy on napping on breaks changed? How about napping during overnight shifts?\nYes, we updated our policy in 2012. Based on staffing and workload – and when no duties are assigned – we offer employees break opportunities to attend to personal needs, rejuvenate their mental acuity, and other similar activities. These break opportunities are available on all work shifts, including overnight shifts.\nDoes the FAA still prohibit schedules with a single controller on duty after midnight?\nThe FAA makes a practice of staffing at least two controllers on midnight shifts. There could be situations in which an individual calls in sick, but that is not standard. On those rare occasions, we have implemented additional procedures to ensure controller alertness.\nSource:-FAA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:14:06.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
