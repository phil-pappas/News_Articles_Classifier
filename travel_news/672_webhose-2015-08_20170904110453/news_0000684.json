(AP) — Thousands of Michigan residents waited for electricity Monday as they cleaned up from violent winds that uprooted trees, snapped branches and spoiled the landscape in some of the state's most popular tourist spots.\nAt least one tornado was confirmed in Owendale in Huron County, the National Weather Service said. Sunday's storms caused extensive property damage but no injuries, about 95 miles north of Detroit.\nThe northwestern Lower Peninsula was hit hard, especially Leelanau County, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore along Lake Michigan and Traverse City, all magnets for summer tourism.\nSome hikers who were climbing the dune as the storm swept through said they felt fortunate to survive wind, hail and rain.\nThe sand blasts \"felt like a million needles,\" Kathy Ockaskis told The Grand Rapids Press. \"People were yelling, 'We're going to die.' ... It was horrifying. The most painful thing I've ever endured.\"\nRanger Merrith Baughman said some people won't recognize areas of the park.\n\"It's pretty startling considering the size of the trees and the number of trees that have come down,\" Baughman said. \"It's remarkable that no one was injured.\"\nChain saws sold like fresh doughnuts when the door opened Monday at 6 a.m. at Roy's General Store in the Traverse City area — \"sometimes two at a time,\" manager Rob Hentschel told the Traverse City Record-Eagle.\nConsumers Energy said 75,000 customers still had no power Monday afternoon. DTE Energy reported 41,000, with half of the outages in the state's Thumb region. Restoration could take a few days.\nTraverse City Light and Power and Cherryland Electric Cooperative also had customers without electricity.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said it rescued a 33-year-old man who had been in Lake Michigan without his kayak for about six hours Sunday. He was flashing a light and wearing a life jacket. A brother had safely made it to South Manitou Island.\n\"Boaters should always be prepared for the worst situation, including checking the weather prior to setting out,\" said Capt. Amy Cocanour, commander of Coast Guard Sector Lake Michigan.\nThe largest hail was reported near West Branch, where it measured 4.25 inches — about the size of a softball — and was the biggest on record in northern Michigan since data collection began in 1950, the weather service said.\nThe storms caused widespread damage in Rogers City, The Alpena News reported. Winds toppled dozens of trees, which landed on homes and collapsed a large tent for the upcoming Nautical Festival.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T01:52:18.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
