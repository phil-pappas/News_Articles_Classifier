The society has a strategic priority to grow its membership in the region and was one of the first MICE associations to work with authorities to establish a chapter in China. \n\nEarlier this year, members of the SITE International Board of Directors spent time in Asia meeting with industry leaders in Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau. Chapters in China and India are growing and there is great interest in establishing new chapters in Singapore and Hong Kong, said Kohli. \n\nHighlights of the conference include sessions on how to successfully operate programmes in India, how to gain a share of the fastest growing outbound travel markets and how to create real results from an incentive. \n\nThe conference, to be held from October 23 to 25, is expected to attract over 300 incentive travel professionals. At press time, 170 delegates from 30 countries have already registered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:54:06.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
