Bags are the protective connections between our gear and us. That was the thinking that brought about Whistler.\"Whistler is a versatile, four-season technical backpack that comes in two sizes - 350 AW and 450 AW. Ideal for wilderness photographers and adventurers who carry an equal measure of camera, video and functional outdoor equipment, the bag's hinged and zippered back panel offers partial or full access to photography gear, and its rigid internal structure can support attachment of skis, poles, tripods, ice axes and more. Featuring Lowepro's ActivZone System™ harness and MaxFit™ divider system, the bag is comfortable to wear and flexible to pack. Whistler's extra-protective build keeps gear safe from the elements, including a waterproof fabric and base, detachable All Weather AW Cover™ and removable camera gear insert. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:13:08.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
