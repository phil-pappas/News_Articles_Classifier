The streets are empty; it's very calm and quiet. My view is very lush, and itâ€™s as if the plants want to make up for the lost time in winter and autumn. It's quite windy and the only sound I can hear is the the trees swaying in the wind. I can smell the freshly cut grass from the lot next to me. My neighbour takes good care of it, as he wants to sell it; the land prices have been rising in the last few years. I feel very calm here; that is why I love it so much.
