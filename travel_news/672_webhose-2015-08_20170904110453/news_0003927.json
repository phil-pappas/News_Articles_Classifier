My family's still hurting.\"\nBrown said the anniversary brings back all of the grief and raw emotions, but that it's important to continue standing up to concerns about police brutality and the use of force. His son's death helped spur a national \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. As the parade began, he took an armful of stuffed animals and placed them in the middle of the street where his son died.\nThe U.S. Justice Department and a St. Louis County grand jury cleared Wilson, who resigned in November, of wrongdoing. A separate Justice Department investigation of Ferguson's justice system found evidence of a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias by police.\nMichael Brown Sr., center, takes part in a parade in honor of his son, Michael Brown, Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.

Ferguson interim Police Chief Andre Anderson stood alongside St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol on West Florissant Avenue — the site of protests, looting and riots in the aftermath of Brown's death — waving to parade participants and shaking hands with some.\nA vocal group of about 30 people marching in the parade began chanting \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\" as they neared the officers, then \"Pigs in a blanket fry like bacon.\" Otherwise, the crowd was peaceful. Police presence was limited mostly to officers at intersections keeping traffic away from the parade, and there were no immediate reports of confrontations.\nDarius Simpson, 22, made the trip to Ferguson from Eastern Michigan University for the weekend and was in the parade. Simpson, who is black, said he had never been an activist until Brown's death, but said a visit to Ferguson last year during the height of the unrest changed him.\nA memorial in memory of Michael Brown is seen in a sidewalk near where Brown was shot and killed as a parade in honor of Brown passes by Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) \"Something snapped in me, seeing the memorial, seeing how Ferguson reacted inspired me to take it back to Michigan,\" Simpson said.\nSt. Louis resident Carlatta Bussey, 41, brought her 7-year-old son. \"I wanted to show him he needs to stand up for what he believes in,\" said Bussey, who is black. \"It's important for him to know he has a voice.\"\nMarches were planned later Saturday in St. Louis and on Sunday, again starting on Canfield Drive. The Sunday march will stop just before noon for a moment of silence to mark the moment Brown was killed.\nMichael Brown Sr. along with family and friends stop to pray at a memorial to Brown's son before taking part in a parade in his son's honor Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Ferguson, Mo.

Though some groups are pledging civil disobedience in the St. Louis region, Brown urged everyone to mark his son's death in peace.\n\"No drama,\" he said. \"No stupidity, so we can just have some kind of peace.\"\nPeople march down West Florissant Avenue during a parade in honor of Michael Brown Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Jennings, Mo.
