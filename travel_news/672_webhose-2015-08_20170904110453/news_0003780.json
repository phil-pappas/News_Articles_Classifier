James Martin \nOk, so maybe it's not exactly boring, but much of Tuscany isn't spectacular. You want evidence? How about a cuisine that has at its pinnacle a barely grilled T-bone slathered in the old times with olive oil and dusted with black pepper? Or one in which its practitioners quaff a classic wine (Chianti) made up of a mutt-like blend of whatever grapes, white or red, may be on hand? C'mon... \nThink for a moment of the naturally spectacular places you might know about on the face of the earth, places where you'd think you can't take a bad picture: Yosemite, the Himalayas, Pantagonia, the Galapagos, the Amazon basin, the Grand Canyon. The list can go on but there's one thing that you'll notice: not one place on it is known as a magnet for cultural achievement. \nBy contrast, central Tuscany is a land of rolling hills, some crawling with vines, others swathed in the waving stalks of grain. South of Sienna is the Crete Senesi , the sometimes barren, clay hills of Sienna province which are strangely photogenic. On the coast east of Sienna you'll find the maremma , the coastal plain of scrub, cowboys, cows, and sad Etruscan tombs. Spectacular? Not a chance. Provocative, well that's a different story. \nThe Renaissance struck hard in Tuscany. Perhaps it was because life was good, but needed art to be better. Perhaps the same could be said about the geography; it was human-friendly enough to offer solid sustenance--but wasn't spectacularly awesome in itself. I classify it as a peasant landscape: pleasing enough to the eye, but hard working and utilitarian rather then rich. Like Tuscan cuisine, it's just \"ok\" at first and then you find that it grows on you. And no matter how you classify this landscape, it is, as the Italians often translate, \"suggestive.\" \nNow, the word \"suggestive\" in American English usually refers to the erotic allure of a scantily clad woman with a \"come hither\" look in her eye. But think about it: the hills of Tuscany do have a sort of erotic sensuality, do they not? The key is this: Nature's spectacles are complete in themselves and need no human intervention to hold one in awe, but the rolling hills of Tuscany seem incomplete without their waving stalks of grain or the rows of vines--just like the erotic vision of the woman is nothing without the fantasy of interaction in the mind of her male observer. Humans were required to complete Tuscany's alluring landscape, and many times they did it in spectacular fashion, as in our picture of Pitigliano above. It's not just that medieval architects integrated a whole town into a tufa ridge, but ancient people on the plains below carved out sunken roads in the soft tuff known as Le Vie Cave . \nEverywhere you look, the hill towns, the stone architecture, the early Romanesque churches and chapels all enhance the Tuscan landscape. \n(See page two for more, including tourist attractions in the Chianti hills, the Crete Senese, and the Coastal Maremma) Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T11:17:40.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
