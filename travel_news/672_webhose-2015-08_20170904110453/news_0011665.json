The photo shows the Teej procession in Tripolia Bazaar Jaipur. Teej is a traditional north Indian festival but nowhere else it merits a procession of this pomp and is a long standing tradition here under royal patronage. The photo was published in today's Jaipur print edition. In the ePaper editions, it's not very clear. In the regular web version, it's been published here - http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/n...w/48620448.cms . A friend who sent me this news this morning, said of the five thousand entries, 30 have been published. I'm humbled on being selected- the other photos I saw are of an amazing quality and technical expertise. ) This specific photo shows the main deity 'Teej mata' (an incarnation of parvati, shiva's wife) surrounded by staff of the Royal family of Jaipur. This is the last part of a procession that has at-least 20 other unique displays, some on camels and elephants. An estimated 100,000 people join the procession in Jaipur. I'll try to do a write up with some other photos I've captured later. - V_A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T07:38:34.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
