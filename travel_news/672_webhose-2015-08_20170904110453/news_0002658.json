The bookings were made and a child-friendly route (our girls are nine, seven and four) was chosen.\nScrambling across Austria: The breathtaking view of Mayrofen in the Tyrol region\nWe opted for Mayrhofen in the Tyrol region of Austria for its proximity to Innsbruck airport (one hour by car), as well as the variety of summer activities.\nMy wife Fiona and I planned to hike for three or four consecutive days and use the rest of our time at the swimming pool, the new climbing zone and generally enjoying this mountain resort.\nTo ease us into this adventure, a day or two of acclimatisation was necessary, and Hotel Edenlehen was the ideal spot.\nSwimming pool, large garden with play equipment and a short walk into Mayrhofen — perfect.\nPerhaps too perfect: the huts would not only be a big hike up, but also a considerable step down.\n Next When the journey really IS the best part: The scenic roads... Rare photographs show the fascinating early days of London's... Film student spends loan capturing spine-tingling time-lapse... Forget the Maldives and Australia's Bondi: Brits would... Our first day's hiking was brilliant. All routes have a stated time that is a consistent, conservative calculation of how long it will take.\nThe first walk was just 90 minutes. It was all steep uphill, gaining 600m in altitude over that time.\nOur path proved a massive hit. Scrambling but never dangerous and the children loved it.\nTabitha took the role of lead climber and repeatedly managed to veer off what was a perfectly clear path (that's why four-year-olds don't do this alone).\nHer energy and enthusiasm never flagged and we arrived, exhilarated, on the warm sunny terrace of the Olperer Hut (altitude 2,389m) after exactly 90 minutes.\nFiona and I enjoyed a beer on the terrace, mightily relieved the children had not only survived, but had enjoyed the hike.\nThe only downside was that we had to share a dorm (not the private room we were expecting) with three others. The girls were shattered, so by lights out at 10pm they were all fast asleep anyway.\nThe huts are owned by a variety of organisations with an interest in the Alps. There is a communal feel to them.\nYoung hikers: Tabitha, Flora and Celia on their Austrian Alps adventure, which included a six-hour mountain walk\nBathrooms, with good showers, are adequate. There is a limited but good menu to choose from, plus a well-stocked bar.\nBut given the altitude and challenge in getting supplies to the huts (the Olperer hut is supplied by helicopter), people should not expect haute cuisine.\nChildren always seemed to get an especially warm welcome, and Martina, the Olperer hut guardian, provided the highlight of the entire trip by taking the girls to collect eggs from the chickens.\nThe sense of community carries on when you are walking. A 'hello', or 'gruss gott' in Austrian, is always exchanged when passing (or in our case, being overtaken) by others.\nAt a tricky stream crossing, assistance was readily offered by a group of fully kitted (ropes, ice axes, crampons, the lot) youths, by helping the younger ones bridge some particularly large gaps.\nDay two: would our luck hold out? The stated time on our route was four hours.\nWe traversed boulders deposited by glaciers and, despite broadly following a contour, the trek was never flat and always awkward under foot, especially little feet.\nThe weather was a concern, forecast to be clear until midday and then a threat of rain, so no time to dawdle. Gone were the shorts and T-shirts of the day before, replaced by everything we were carrying.\nLooking down on the world: Hiking helps travellers to discover just how beautiful Mayrhofen in Austria is\nWe set off at 8am. Six hours, plus quite a few Fruit Pastilles later, we arrived at our destination: the Pfitscherjoch hut (altitude 2,276m). It was hard going, particularly for our two younger ones.\nWe kept finding unstable rocks that became known as 'wobblers' that made sure footing more difficult.\nThe weather was overcast and cool but, thankfully, the threatened rain did not materialise. I was proud of all of them.\nThis time we had a room to ourselves and after a fantastic spaghetti bolognese we were all in bed and asleep before 10pm.\nThe next day a different challenge presented itself. Ten degrees colder, horizontal rain and poor visibility.\nI consulted Joseph Volgger, the fifth generation of his family to operate this hut (built in 1888), who said the weather would improve in the afternoon.\nSome companies offer child-friendly hikes for the whole family to enjoy. Pictured: The Gaisbergtal valley\nWe decided to play for time — Uno and Monopoly saved the day.\nFive generations of experience proved right and the weather window opened after midday. We hiked to our next destination following a beautiful stream to the Schlegeis reservoir.\nAustria is set up for family walking. Everything works. The paths are well marked.\nThe huts we stayed in were clean, modern, efficient and friendly.\nClassic Austrian food — noodle soup, Wiener schnitzel and apple strudel — was simple and tasty.\nWould we do it again? Certainly.\nWould we invest in better kit? Probably. Beach holidays will always be a hit, but hut-to-hut hiking is the preference of Celia and Tabitha for our next holiday.\nFiona and Flora may take some persuasion.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own Austrian Alps adventure EasyJet flies to Innsbruck from £47 return.\nHalfboard in the huts ( olpererhuette.de and pfitscherjochhaus.com ) costs from £70 per night for a family of five, with a discount available to members of the Alpine Club (020 7613 0755, alpineclub.org.uk ).\nFamily rooms at Hotel Edenlehen in Mayrhofen (0043 5285 62300, edenlehen.com ) cost from £56 pp per night half-board in the summer with discounts for children.\nMore information at mayrhofen.at\nRead more: Book direct for our guaranteed cheapest prices - easyJet Zillertaler Hütte für den Urlaub in den Bergen - Olpererhütte Pfitscherjoch-Haus ugs.
