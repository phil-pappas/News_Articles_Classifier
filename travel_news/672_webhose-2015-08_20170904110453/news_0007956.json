On August 16 (before his photo was published) he tweeted that he was “at a beach in Kos this AM. Heard scream for help out of the dark. Informed the coast guard who was reluctant to come”. \nIn another tweet he added: “Came after more than one hour, and pulled out two drifting boats.” \nWhile it is not known if Mr Majid was on one of those boats, it is clear many desperate refugees are risking their lives to escape the horror of their war-torn homes.

The Eleftherios Venizelos left the island of Kos with about 1700 Syrian refugees on board, and picked up another 900 on the islands of Kalymnos, Leros and Lesbos.

And others, show hope. \nMillions of people around the world have now seen the picture, with the overwhelming response being one of empathy with those that are trying to make a new life.
