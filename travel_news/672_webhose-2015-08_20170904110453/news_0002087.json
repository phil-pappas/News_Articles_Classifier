TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE IN SOUTH AFRICA One of the most thrilling and intimate ways to experience Africa is on foot. andBeyond has exceptional guides and trackers who are passionate about the history, culture and animals in the area. The specialist guides will lead trails to get up close with smaller game such as impala and nyala antelope and tread in the tracks of zebra and elephant. Each walk is tailored to the indivdiual so guests can choose to walk for a couple of hours or spend the entire day on foot tracking the animals.. More adventurous guests can choose to walk to another lodge on the reserve or even spend the night out in the bush under the stars.
