It was 2013 and coding boot camps were already an established concept in the US, but there was nothing on this side of the Atlantic. At the same time, the media was full of reports about a double-sided coin: the extraordinary boom in the UK tech industry, particularly in London, and the chronic skills shortage that was threatening to stifle its potential. Shadchnev and his co-founder, Rob Johnson, reasoned that there had to be a way to help address that situation, and that’s how Makers Academy, which is based in the heart of East London’s tech hub, was born. “Our courses consist of a four-week, part-time pre-course, followed by 12 weeks’ intensive on-site tuition, after which graduates are ready to enter the job market at junior developer level. That makes them a very immediate response to the problem,” says Mr Shadchnev. Some are completely new to coding and others are computer science graduates who need to build on their practical skills What is unusual about the Makers Academy business model is that it just about covers its costs with the tuition fee. Its profitability actually comes from placing graduates in jobs. “That’s how we measure our success.” Although some students are not looking for new jobs, either because they are entrepreneurs running their own businesses or they just want to enhance the skills they can bring to their existing roles, Mr Shadchnev estimates that the academy places well over half of its graduates in tech posts. “We have partnered with many of London’s top technology companies and at the end of the course we introduce students to the companies looking to hire. Our goal is to have a 100 per cent placement rate among those seeking employment after graduating from our web development boot camp,” says Mr Shadchnev. Students come from all walks of life and represent a cross-section of age groups. “We have everything from 18-year-old school leavers to bankers and lawyers and returning mums in their 50s.” Computer kings: you don't need a computer science degree to become a developer Some are completely new to coding and others are computer science graduates who need to build on their practical skills. “There’s a misconception that you need a computer science degree to become a developer,” says Mr Shadchnev, “but in fact our courses are able to offer much more flexibility in terms of response to fast-changing technology than a three-year university degree ever could.” While the first half of the course concentrates on the fundamentals of web development and the Ruby programming language, the second half focuses heavily on students creating real-life projects (they leave with at least three complete pieces of work for their portfolios). The philosophy at Makers Academy is that you can’t really teach someone to code. What you can teach them is how to learn to code. Mr Shadchnev says: “One of the most important skills of a good developer is the ability to learn things, to find ingenious solutions to unexpected problems. The technologies used today will be obsolete in a matter of years. A developer needs to know how to learn new things.” Students are also taught the importance of collaboration and teamwork. Taking the approach that “two heads are better than one”, particularly in web development, the Academy focuses on “pair-programming”, says Mr Shadchnev. “We also stress the importance of writing tests before you write your code. That’s what employers love about our graduates: they come with all these great practices.” • Find out more about coding and how to sign up for Makers Academy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:53:55.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
