We're right on the Penobscot Bay, on a peninsula. The Penobscot Bay flows right out into the Atlantic Ocean — they call it the Gulf of Maine. We have 1,200 feet of waterfront. It is a very rocky waterfront … almost like cliffs, so it's not conducive to swimming. The other reason is that the water temperature is cold. In July and August, I think [it's] around 55 degrees. … So we like to look at it. \nDo you have a boat? \nNo, I tried to convince my wife but she said, \"No, let's charter or go out on other people's boats [laughs].\" There are just so many great islands off the coast. Someone told me that Maine has hundreds of islands. In fact, we know people from Baltimore that have places on a couple of the islands. We can look across and see five or six [islands], including Vinalhaven. I guess one of the most notable islands is Islesboro, I think its like 21 miles long. Some movie stars have places there, like John Travolta. \nHow do visitors get to the islands? \nThere is a town north of us called Lincolnville that has a ferry that goes to Islesboro. There's a town south of us called Rockland with a ferry that goes to several islands, including Vinalhaven. \nDo you have any favorite go-to restaurants ? \nOur favorite is in Rockland, maybe 20 minutes away. It's called Primo. The chef there has received the James Beard Award twice in the last five years — very unusual. Another is in Camden, the Hartstone Inn. The chef there is really great. It's an inn with 20-some rooms. We didn't know that the restaurant was not only for its guests until a friend told us about it. \nWhen friends come up and need to find accommodations, where do you suggest they stay? \nWell, that's happened. When we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary we said rather than do one big party, we decided to do several venues [to include friends near their other homes] … and spread it out through the year. [In Maine] it turned out we had 107 people — 25 came from the Baltimore area. We had to put up a tent and all sorts of things we hadn't planned on. We had to figure out where should we suggest they stay. One was Samoset Resort in Rockport, which has a great hotel, spa and all those amenities, and [is] just 20 minutes from the house. There are numerous bed-and-breakfasts in Camden, and our friends who live there gave us a list of recommendations. Camden Maine Stay Inn was one. \nWhen you go, do you usually drive or fly to get there? \nWe fly, because if you stop for a meal, it could be an 11- to 12-hour drive. \nI've heard that you and your wife travel frequently. \nWe travel quite a bit around the United States, and outside. One thing we've sought to do over the past several summers: We have three grandsons, [ages] 18, 14, and 8, and we want them to experience other cultures and places, so we have begun to take them on trips outside the U.S. \nSuch as? \nWe have done a safari to Africa. It was 12 days. The oldest grandson loves animals and one of his dreams was to actually go on a safari and experience the migration. We went to Tanzania, Serengeti, and then a week in Kenya in the Maasai Mara. So we experienced the crossing from the Serengeti into Maasai Mara, where [there were] thousands of animals. We went at its peak, in late July. I remember one afternoon in Serenget,i we saw all of the Big Five [Africa's Big Five are: lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and buffalo]. Boy, we were in heaven! \nAnd then this past June [they again went] with the grandsons and their parents. We really like the National Geographic vacations … focusing on the family trips. We gave them a choice of three different trips: Antarctica, the Galapagos and Scotland. And for whatever reason, they said, \"Let's do Scotland.\" It was a very small group on this National Geographic tour. Including us, there was [also] a couple, ironically from an island off of Portland, Maine, with their two grandchildren, and then there was a lady from Kansas and she had her 15-year-old grandson. We're the only ones who brought the parents; everyone else just brought the kids [laughs]. I'm going to have to remember that! \nWere you there for the solstice?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T02:51:18.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
