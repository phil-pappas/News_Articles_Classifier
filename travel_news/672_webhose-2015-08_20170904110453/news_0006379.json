Bye bye, boarding pass. Passport, are you next? Source: Getty Images \nIT’S the bane of many travellers. How many times have you furiously dug through your jacket pockets and backpack in the hope of finding your elusive boarding pass, while airport staff glare at you and the line behind you swells? \nWell in news that’s sure to have some travellers ecstatic — and others nostalgic — the end could soon be near for the travel essential. \nAt least that’s what Alaska Airlines hopes. It’s aiming to make flying easier by testing a machine that scans the fingerprints of travellers as they check in. It uses biometrics, an automated way of analysing a person’s physical characteristics to verify it is in fact that person. \nThe pilot program began in April and involves about 200 Alaska Airlines passengers who frequently fly domestically from Mineta San Jose International Airport in California.

Airport officials were able to look up the passengers’ boarding passes electronically after their fingerprints were scanned. \nWhile biometrics has been tested in some airports around Europe and the US, Mr Tolzman said it has a long way to go — and we probably won’t be able to replace our passports with our fingerprints any time soon. But it will be worth it. \n“Using biometrics as identification has a huge potential to simplify the travel experience and eliminate hassles, while adding to the security of air travel. We’re very excited to see where we can take this next.” \nWhether similar systems will be used in Australia is not yet known. But we can hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:51:31.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
