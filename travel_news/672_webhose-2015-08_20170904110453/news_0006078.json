They're wildly popular for stag weekends – but the good news is you don't necessarily need to have a friend getting married (or re-married) to join in. The West Country Games are a fun, light-hearted, occasionally physically challenging way to bond with old friends or new colleagues – and, most importantly, they’re a great laugh. Here are six reasons why you should give the West Country Games a go. 1. It's not just for stag dos Okay, obviously the whole thing is geared up for the stag and hen market – but don’t go thinking that means it’s a Club 18-30-type deal. West Country Games also cater for corporate awaydays, team-building events, birthdays… pretty much anything involving a group of like-minded people. Yes, you may need to leave a certain (hefty) amount of your dignity at the door, but then so will everyone else – and there’s nothing like everyone mucking in and getting silly together to bring people closer. 2. The nine challenges involved throw a bit of everything at you Think It’s a Knockout meets traditional country fair with a dollop of Monty Python thrown in and you won’t go far wrong. There are sumo bouts in super-sized inflatable outfits, human skittles, welly-wanging, inflatable pitchfork duels, tractor-tyre rolling, and more. The emphasis is on fun – but there’s also a healthy amount of competition involved. Every game has a clear winner, and most involve a good amount of teamwork too as everyone participates in each activity. 3. You get to dress up Everyone loves dressing up, right? Traditional and stereotypical farmer and farmyard animal costumes provided, obviously. 4. It’s not just about silliness West Country Games was started in 2010 by childhood friends Jamie and Simon and their current location is in Gatcombe Farm, just outside of Bristol. As well as all the fun, the farm hosts a restaurant serving freshly-picked local produce, and a farm shop selling more of the same. The combination of a day out in the English countryside, good food and quality bonding time with your best friends (or failing that, work colleagues) is nigh-on unbeatable. And the whole thing is not only organised for you, but they’ll make sure it’s all photographed, too. 5. You’ll laugh more than you would have thought possible There’s a reason It’s a Knockout was so funny – and that’s because, once you strip away any concerns about maintaining your “cool”, getting dressed up, chucking stuff around and falling over on giant inflatables is actually pretty hilarious. It’s almost guaranteed that any initial reservations about the daftness of the whole day will be forgotten once you start laughing. 6. There’s cider afterwards Well of course there is!
