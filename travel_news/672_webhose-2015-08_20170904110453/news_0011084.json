Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo (pehn-TAN'-jeh-loh) says it happened at 8:45 a.m. Wednesday. The dispute started after a 61-year-old passenger at a window seat tried to climb over another woman as Jet Blue Flight 960 approached the gate. The older woman used an eyebrow razor to slash the 52-year-old woman and a man who tried to intervene. The younger woman then used pepper-spray on the knife-wielding passenger. Seven passengers were treated for difficulty breathing. Police say the 61-year-old was arrested on assault and weapons charges. The other woman was arrested for possessing pepper spray.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:50:54.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
