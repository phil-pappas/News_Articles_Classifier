It is not just for the flight. People might also engage our services for a three-week cruise.\" \nIn one case, a family with an autistic child took a travel nanny with them for a 10-day trip to give the mum a break. \nThe starting rate for the service is A$690 9NZ$763) per 24 hours as well as the cost of the airfare for the nanny or medical professional. \n\"It is a premium product,\" Wilson said. \"It is not for everyone, this service.\" \nWilson, a former Ansett executive, believes demand for the services will increase as the population ages. \nHAND-HOLDING SERVICE \nA classic example of a potential client would be an elderly woman travelling to London to see family who can't carry her bags herself and needs a bit of help navigating Changi Airport during the stopover. In such as case, it would also be possible to have the companion meet her in Singapore rather than flying all the way to London. Ad Feedback \n\"We don't get involved in carrying oxygen bottles or anything like this,\" he said. \"This is really a hand-holding service for people to travel. All of our work is on commercial flights.\" \nFor the airlines, this is another ancillary service they can offer to earn revenue, although it is far more tailored than items like baggage fees or meals on board. The addition of the companion also allows them to sell an extra seat on the aircraft. MTC does not provide the service for unaccompanied minors because airlines offer that service separately. \nMTC takes direct bookings for travel on any carrier and expects to sign up more airlines next year after the expiration of an online exclusivity agreement with Singapore Airlines. \nMTC has 50 staff in Australia, as well as three in London and four in the United States to assist with flights around the world. It was formed last year by Wilson, and Dr Matt Hooper, who serves as the chief medical officer. \nMuch of its work to date has been for insurance companies. Wilson'sdaughter was in South Africa on a school exchange program and ended up in a regional hospital on an IV drip with two infected feet and an infected knee. When she was discharged and deemed fit to fly, MTC provided a travel companion because she was in a wheelchair and required assistance. \nâ€‹\"Rather than mum and dad having to fly all the way over there and stop their jobs in Australia, we could dispatch a professional clinical nurse to be a companion bringing her home,\" he said. \n\"That was covered by travel insurance. But quite often they are not.\" - BusinessDay", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T14:01:24.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
