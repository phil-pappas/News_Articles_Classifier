Baltimore has landed the 2016 annual convention for a national civil rights organization — a big win for a city whose tourism and convention industries have taken a hard hit since April's riots. The National Urban League will bring its 2016 annual conference to the Baltimore Convention Center on Aug. 3-6, 2016. The decision comes after Baltimore’s April riots and a spike in crime have deterred many leisure visitors and business groups ; the unrest has had a lasting impact on the city's hospitality and tourism business. With expected attendance of 13,000 and an economic impact of $4.2 million, the National Urban League's conference will provide a needed boost. “Our desire to come to Baltimore was also a timely one,” Marc Morial , president and CEO of the National Urban League, said in a statement. “We are committed to partnering with our affiliate, the Greater Baltimore Urban League, Mayor Rawlings-Blake and the entire city of Baltimore to empower residents and make a notable impact in the local community.” The conference will include sessions and workshops designed to empower communities and individuals working to secure economic independence, power and civil rights. \nWant Baltimore Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:52:17.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
