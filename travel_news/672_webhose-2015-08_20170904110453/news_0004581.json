This demonstrates our goal to further our company transparency and commitment to these communities by providing as detailed communication as possible.”\nInformation contained in this report covers the period of January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, unless otherwise stated. The GRI provides WestJet with thorough reporting of key performance indicators by which the company can measure corporate social responsibility. The 2013 and 2014 CSR report addresses indicators compatible with GRI’s application level B+. The 2013 and 2014 report is based on 20 performance indicators, while previous reports gauged performance based on 10 indicators.\nThe report spans over two years to align more closely with the timing of WestJet’s annual report, and provides coverage across all areas of the company. This report is an accessible reflection of WestJet’s commitment to enriching the lives of everyone in its world.\nThe Global Reporting Initiative is an independent global organization that works with the United Nations Environment Program to make sustainability reporting standard practice. GRI produces a comprehensive sustainability reporting framework that is widely used around the world to promote greater organizational transparency. The framework sets out the principles and indicators organizations can use to measure and report their economic, environmental and social performance. GRI is committed to continuously improving and increasing the use of the guidelines, which are freely available to the public.\nSource:- Westjet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T07:12:12.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
