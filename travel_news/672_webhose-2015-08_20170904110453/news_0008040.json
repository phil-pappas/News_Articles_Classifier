Opening Sept. 5, the resort features 35 suites and 25 villas, the latter with open-air passages between bedroom and living areas, arranged around a terraced rice field on the Ayung River. The eight-treatment-room spa features a riverfront yoga studio and classes ranging from art therapy and circuit training in the jungle to juicing and vegan cooking. Four restaurants and lounges will feature detoxifying culinary options as well as more indulgent ones, and much of the produce is sourced from an on-site garden. Rounding out its holistic approach, Mandapa welcomes children too; the resort’s Green Camp kid’s program focuses on environmental learning and Balinese culture. Rooms from $570. NEW FAMILY CRUISES FROM TAUCK Lacking the bells, whistles and water parks of oceangoing vessels, river cruise ships tend to attract more adult travelers, though the tour operator Tauck plans to double its family river cruise departures in the next two years. It currently offers 10 family-focused itineraries on Europe’s Danube, Rhine and Rhone Rivers in 2016 and will expand to 20 family trips in 2017 on those and one more to-be-determined waterway. The new route is in the planning phase, but the company says it designs its trips with children in mind, pointing to current excursions that include scavenger hunts in the Louvre Museum in Paris; medieval games in Bratislava, Slovakia; guided riverside cycling trips in Austria; and cooking classes of the gooey variety involving chocolate, marzipan and fondue. The 2016 trips start at $3,690 per person on the eight-day Blue Danube: Family Riverboat Adventure cruise. LABOR DAY DISCOUNTS IN ORLANDO With most families occupied by back-to-school preparations, Labor Day weekend is a relatively low-season holiday for the theme parks and resorts of Orlando. Many of the latter are offering discounts up to 40 percent off rooms compared with holidays like July 4. Among examples, Cabana Bay at Universal Orlando Resort is offering rooms from $116 per night through Sept. 6, and the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress is offering the fourth night free between Aug. 24 and Dec. 23 on rooms starting at $159 per night. Beginning Aug. 24 and throughout September, visitors can take advantage of more deals, this time on food, during Orlando’s inaugural Magical Dining Month , featuring $33 prix fixe dinners at a range of restaurants. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:55:51.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
