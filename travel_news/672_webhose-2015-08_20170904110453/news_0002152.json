As a result of this agreement, STA will then be is a position to continuously provide professional courses to its current and future students. \nAs for the second MoU, Mr. Joubert said that the academy sees the introduction of a new exciting project whereby the Constance Belle Mare Plage in Mauritius will be providing Advanced Practical internship for STA’s Wellness and Spa graduates. The Advanced Practical internship can be from one to six months with the possibility that the STA graduates could benefit from a two-year working experience in Constance Hotels in Mauritius. The first STA Wellness and Spa graduate to benefit from this Advanced Practical internship is 21-year-old Annie Julienne, who was also present at the ceremony, accompanied by her proud parents. \n“I am so excited and cannot wait to embark on this new journey. Receiving this internship is a result of all the late nights studying and the hard work I have put in. I am glad that the Constance Hotels are supporting the local tourism students by providing such professional training. This helps students like me to get one step closer in achieving our dreams,” said Miss Julien while speaking to the local media. \nMr. Narain who is also the patron of STA, stated that the global hospitality industry has evolved tremendously over the years and will continue to grow at a swift pace. “We are living in a digital age whereby everything and everyone is becoming dependent on technology, and the hospitality industry is no different. Therefore, the more reason why Constance Hotels and the Seychelles Tourism Academy realized it’s imperative that today’s tourism students should get more familiar and hands-on experience with hospitality designed programs,” said Mr. Narain. He went on to explain that MICROS is a global market leader in developing “point-of-sale” (POS) software systems for the retail, hospitality, and catering industries. In fact, he averred, that it is one of the most common used software systems currently found in Mauritius and growing rapidly in Seychelles, too. \nFor his part, Minister St Ange expressed his satisfaction in seeing once again a partnership between the private sector and the STA for the greater good of Seychelles’ tourism industry. “It’s only when we work together whilst using each other’s strength that we are able to move mountains. I am pleased that more and more private companies are recognizing the importance to invest in tourism education,” said Minister St.Ange. Furthermore, he was also particularly pleased to hear that Constance Hotels are also interested in assisting STA with specialized training in the field of managing Kids Clubs as Seychelles is slowly but surely also becoming a family destination. \nPHOTOS: \nTop - The distinguished guests present at the ceremony consisted mainly of tourism key stakeholders and business leaders.
