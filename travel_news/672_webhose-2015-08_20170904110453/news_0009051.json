A troupe of male and female performers entertained visitors on the South Bank throughout the day with a number of performances accompanied by the steady beat of the specialist drummers. \nInformation about Visit Maldives Year (VMY) 2016 was provided to the visitors along with promotional materials. The main purpose of this event is to boost the number of arrivals from UK and to commence the VMY 2016 celebrations in UK. Mr. Mohamed Adam, Deputy Managing Director of MMPRC says, “We wanted to bring a taste of our Maldivian culture to the UK and felt London’s Southbank provided the perfect platform to showcase our cultural heritage at this exciting time and to encourage UK travellers to come and experience it for themselves in the Maldives.” UK is the third largest market to Maldives by the end of May 2015 with 7.7% of the market share. From January to May 2015, 25,444 tourist arrivals were recorded from UK. Although the arrivals from the market declined in the recent months, the arrivals are forecasted to increase in the upcoming months.
