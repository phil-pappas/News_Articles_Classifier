Endless upkeep? Endless spending on new rides? Endless anxiety about public safety? \nThanks, but no thanks. Some analysts predicted a speedy sale. \nInstead, Comcast did a public about-face, identifying Universal Orlando in particular as a growth engine and spending $100 million to build a Transformers ride here in 2013. \nStill, there was skepticism. Was Comcast becoming a new theme park force? Competitors insisted the jury was still out. \nWell, the verdict just came in: Comcast is pouring billions into Universal Orlando and a sister property in California, opening major attractions and resort hotels, and visitors are flooding the gates as a result. \nAttendance increased 10.4 percent last year, with Universal parks generating 40.2 million turnstile clicks. For the first half of this year, NBCUniversal’s theme park unit had operating cash flow of $617 million, a 49 percent increase from the same period a year ago. \n“That’s just a huge, huge number for a business this size,” Stephen B. Burke, NBCUniversal’s chief executive and senior executive vice president of Comcast, said on a July 23 conference call with analysts. “We see this as a major growth driver for the company for five, 10, 15, 20 years.\" \nBut now Comcast faces a new question: Is it moving too fast and disregarding the perennial problems that have long challenged this corner of entertainment? \nAt Universal Orlando, an 800-acre resort that includes two theme parks, four hotels and an outdoor CityWalk mall, a vast amount of construction is underway. \nFour cranes towered last month over a site that will become Volcano Bay, a new water park. A few hundred feet away, six cranes toiled over an even bigger site marked Project 664. Rising from the ground there is a $300 million hotel called Sapphire Falls, which Universal hopes will strengthen its conference business. \nMore hotel rooms are on the way. Burke has said that Universal Orlando, which will have 5,200 hotel rooms after Sapphire Falls opens next year, could have 10,000 rooms and still maintain profitable occupancy levels. \nSince 2013, Universal Orlando has opened rides themed to Transformers , Despicable Me and the Harry Potter movies. A major King Kong attraction will arrive next summer. \nIn the works are attractions based on the Fast and Furious films, The Tonight Show , Hello Kitty and Nintendo video games. At the CityWalk shopping district, where eight new restaurants have opened over the past two years, an NBC Sports Grill & Brew pub is on the way, complete with 100 televisions. \nAnd that is just in Orlando. Under the guidance of Ron Meyer, NBCUniversal’s vice chairman, the company’s California outpost is undergoing a $1.6 billion expansion anchored by a snow-capped Hogwarts Castle. Universal is also building a $3.25 billion park in Beijing in partnership with a consortium of Chinese companies; it is slated to open in 2019. \n“We’re going to keep our foot on the pedal as far as it will go,” Tom Williams, chairman of Universal Parks and Resorts, said in an interview. “Any chance we get to pour the gas directly into the carburetor, we’ll do that, too.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T08:01:18.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
