Since 1922 she has sat in a dry dock in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard .\nFun facts\nApproximately 6,000 trees were used to make the Victory; there were 26 miles of rigging and 104 cannons onboard.\nBest thing about it?\nThe epic scale (227 feet long, three gun decks) combined with an equally epic history. It’s impressive enough from the dock, but once inside you are transported back in time, with an evocative smell of old timber and a real sense of how 800-plus men lived and fought in cramped conditions. Younger kids can explore the cannons and Georgian naval paraphernalia, older ones and adults get a history lesson, aided by passionate volunteers on hand who’ll regale you with tales all day long if you want.\n One of the Victory’s three gun decks.

Onsite eateries include a tea and cake shop, restaurant serving the usual fare (fish and chips, stone-baked pizza, etc) and a Costa Coffee.\nExit through the gift shop?\nThere isn’t one onboard and we managed to dodge the four dotted around the dockyard.\nGetting there\nTrain is your best bet: Portsmouth Harbour station is only 200 yards from the entrance. The car park is £1 an hour, and the city’s park-and-ride service, near the M275 exit to Portsmouth , is £4 a car.\nOpening times\nThe dockyard opens at 10am every day, last entry to the Victory is 4.45pm April -October, and 4pm November-March.\n Captain’s day cabin and dining room.

Even better value is the full-day ticket to the whole dockyard (adult from £25.60, child £18.40, family £51.60), which also includes entry to the Mary Rose plus other warships and museums, and is valid for one year, historicdockyard.co.uk\nVerdict\nI can’t think of a UK attraction I’ve enjoyed more, so 10/10.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+HMS+Victory%2C+Portsmouth&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F25%2Ftake-the-kids-to-hms-victory-portsmouth-family-day-trips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F25%2F1440501693669%2F7e88185f-e452-4c8f-bc25-81ece02461d8-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bnph%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/tickets-and-offers", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bnph%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+HMS+Victory%2C+Portsmouth&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F25%2Ftake-the-kids-to-hms-victory-portsmouth-family-day-trips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F25%2F1440500858748%2Fd4cb81a5-471a-42f7-8d66-b48141303c73-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+HMS+Victory%2C+Portsmouth&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bnph%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+HMS+Victory%2C+Portsmouth&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bnph%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-08-25T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T10:07:08.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
