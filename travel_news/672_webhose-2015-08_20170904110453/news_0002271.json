It sits on two lots (704 square meters) surrounded by nature. This house was built with formidable solid concrete and masonry construction, includes all furnishings, four bedrooms, four and half baths, hardwood floors, vaulted ceilings, over-sized terraces overlooking exotic plants on the hillside, over-sized living area and much more.\nLocated on the gorgeous Central Pacific coast of Costa Rica and the important nature reserve of Punta Leona in Puntarenas province. This reserve is one of the most vital in Costa Rica’s Pacific sector both from a geographical and conservation point of view. Punta Leona is actually home to one of the last remaining forests that are found in the transitional life zone between the rain forests of the Southwest and the dry forests of the Northwest.\nPunta Leona Refuge\nCreated over 25 years ago to protect the region’s varied flora and fauna, the Punta Leona Refuge is a 300-hectare (750 acres) private nature reserve mainly consisting of lush primary and secondary forests. Also functioning as a center for bird and mammal research, this reserve is the habitat of over 330 migratory and native bird species. Exotic, tropical and beautiful, the Punta Leona Refuge was also the set for a Hollywood movie starring the famous French actor Gerard Depardieu.\nUnique Location\nNot frequented much by tourists, Punta Leona is a fascinating place to visit for nature lovers, bird watchers and families alike, who are given a rare insight into the rich biological diversity of Costa Rica. Home to rare and endangered Scarlet Macaw, the reserve is also the dwelling place to a number of indigenous birds and animals like the Marbled Wood Quail, the three-wattled bellbird, hummingbirds, toucans, spider monkeys, white-faced Monkeys, white-nosed coatimundis, iguanas and a variety of beautiful butterflies.\nPristine White Sand Beach\nLocated near a pristine white sand beach, Punta Leona has three varied walking and hiking trails, all of which are easily accessible and prefect for bird watching. Though a hotel/beach resort actually operates on this reserve, Punta Leona still manages to provide tourists with an environment that is both distinctive and enigmatic. Even if you do not stay at the hotel, visitor can access this park by paying a small fee.\nCentrally Located\nClose by to the Carara National Park and the Manuel Antonio National Park, Punta Leona is an hour’s drive west from San José, along the main costal highway past the town of Tárcoles. If you are coming from the south, this beach is a few kilometers north of Playa Herradura and Jacó.\nSee this and other listings in the new Tico Times Real Estate section here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:04:55.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
