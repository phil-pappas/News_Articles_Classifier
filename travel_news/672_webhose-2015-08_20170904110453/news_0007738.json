Each Wednesday through Sept. 2, Detroit News judges will select four photos that capture something special about our state — the people, wildlife, scenery, activities and events that make it unique. \nOther finalists selected this week: \n■ “Sunset on Lake” by Alicia Gray of White Lake. Her closeup of sunshine glinting off of rippling waves in Lake Neva could pass for an abstract painting in copper and blue. \n■ “Winter Birds” by Hurman Shelton of Bellevue. This avid birdwatcher had only to look outside his picture window to catch a mix of birds at his backyard bird feeder in the snow. \n■ “South Haven Light” by Frank Wildasin of Farmington. Waves crash two stories high over the South Haven pier and lighthouse, making the viewer fear for the lives of tourists just feet away. \nContest prizes are: \n■ First place: A two-night stay for four at Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island. \n■ Second place: $300. \n■ Third place: A gift basket of made-in-Michigan products. \n■ Best digitally enhanced image: A 16-by-20-inch matted and framed print of your photo. \nThe contest is open to all amateur photographers who are 18 years or older, except employees of The Detroit News, Michigan.com and their immediate families. For the complete contest rules, go to detroitnews.com/celebratemichigan , where you can view all of the entries, share them on social media, browse a photo gallery of the finalists and enter your own Michigan scenes. \nDon’t delay! The deadline for submissions is noon Aug. 28.
