The approval comes a few weeks after the aircraft earned certification from Brazil’s civil aeronautics authority (ANAC).\n“The FAA certification highlights our commitment to delivering innovative products that go beyond customer expectations. With its unique features, the Legacy 450 offers outstanding technology and performance, along with unsurpassed comfort and style,” said Marco Tulio Pellegrini, President & CEO of Embraer Executive Jets. “The Legacy 450 is the first mid-light jet with full fly-by-wire technology and side-stick flight controls, which makes it easier to fly. The digital controls produce a smoother flight, improve performance, and reduce pilot workload.”\nThe Legacy 450 comfortably seats up to nine passengers and is the only mid-light jet featuring a 6-foot-tall cabin and a flat floor. Its cross section – 6 feet 10 inches – is the largest in class, five inches wider than its nearest competitor. The first Legacy 450 delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSource:- Embraer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:23:13.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
