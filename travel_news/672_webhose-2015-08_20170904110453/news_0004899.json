It will change the management of the current Ebola outbreak and future outbreaks.” \nMeanwhile, saying the world had reached an important milestone in the global Ebola response, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced that the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response – UNMEER – will close today and hand over its leadership role to WHO. \n“The Mission has achieved its core objective of scaling up the response on the ground and establishing unity of purpose among responders in support of the nationally led efforts,” Mr. Ban said, adding that as of 1 August, oversight of the UN system's Ebola emergency response will fully be led by WHO under the direct authority of its Director-General, Dr. Chan. \n“The United Nations remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the Governments of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in getting to and staying at zero cases,” the UN chief said. \nHis Special Envoy on Ebola, Dr. David Nabarro, who will continue to provide strategic guidance for the response, told reporters in Geneva that the UN mission “was always designed to be a temporary measure, and when it was no longer needed, the UN system would go back to its more normal disposition in responding to the outbreak.” \nUNMEER, the first-ever UN emergency health mission, was established on 19 September 2014 to meet immediate needs related to the unprecedented fight against Ebola. The Mission deployed financial, logistical and human resources to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to support the push to zero cases. \nIn the WHO announcement, Dr. Chan said the credit for the Ebola vaccine development goes to the Guinean Government, the people living in the communities and WHO's partners in this project. \nThe trial is being implemented by the Guinean authorities, WHO, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, with support from a broad partnership of international and national organizations. \nDr. Marie-Paule Kieny, who leads WHO's Ebola Research and Development effort, described the pace of the development as “record-breaking” that “marks a turning point in the history of health R&D.” According to WHO, the vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, and on 24 November 2014, Merck & Co., Inc and NewLink Genetics Corp. entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement wherein Merck assumed responsibility to research, develop, manufacture, and distribute the investigational vaccine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T22:34:43.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
