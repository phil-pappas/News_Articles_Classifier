BlackRock, the largest of these, holds just under 6 per cent of the stock, according to Bloomberg data. \nStarwood, whose brands also include St Regis and Westin, has lost market share in recent years and is conducting a strategic review under an interim chief executive Adam Aron. The company appointed the investment bank Lazard earlier this year to examine its options, a move that caught the attention of “event-driven” hedge funds that look for restructuring and takeover targets. \nOch-Ziff announced it had bought a further 1 per cent of the company last week, while Paulson & Co — run by John Paulson, the hedge fund manager famed for his bet against the US housing market in 2007 — revealed its stake in a quarterly regulatory filing on Friday night. Starwood declined to comment on its shareholders. Earlier this year Starwood hired Lazard to examine its options, a move that caught the attention of ‘event-driven’ hedge funds that look for restructuring and takeover targets \nMr Paulson has an extensive history pushing restructuring in the hotels industry. His fund was part of a consortium that bought Extended Stay out of bankruptcy in 2010 and also controlled MSR Hotels and Resorts, a group of luxury resorts. \nHe has also been active this year in other M&A activity, including pushing for a combination of drug companies Mylan and Perrigo . Paulson & Co did not elaborate on its intentions with Starwood. \nIts emergence on the Starwood share register comes at a time of increased activity by hedge fund managers in the hotels sector, driven by hopes for consolidation and restructuring of property portfolios that could unlock cash to be returned to shareholders. \nUK-listed InterContinental Hotels Group, in which San Francisco-based activist hedge fund Marcato Capital has a 4 per cent stake, recently held exploratory talks with Starwood about a merger, the Financial Times reported. The two are said not to be currently pursuing a combination. \nStarwood, which operates more than 1,200 hotels, has faced an uncertain future since February when it parted ways with Frits van Paaschen, its chief executive of seven years. Under his leadership, rivals stole a march on Starwood by expanding their operations more quickly, particularly at the budget end of the market.
