Les Gets is a lovely resort, ideal for families wanting to try all kinds of exciting winter activities. \nIf you're on the lookout for an exciting destination in Europe to ski, France should be top of the list. While there are plenty from which to choose, Les Gets stands out for many reasons. It is quite a small resort, and maintains an authentic, very French feel to it, but it opens a gateway to a huge area in which you can ski France's best slopes. \nLes Gets for Families \nLes Gets is a great resort for families. Opening up a huge area in which to ski, France and Switzerland can both be accessed from Les Gets, which is linked by the 650km of pistes in the Portes de Soleil. Les Gets offers a huge range of exciting activities to take part in – suitable for all ages and abilities. Of course, Alpine skiing is the most common, but ski touring, tobogganing, snowshoeing and ice-skating are also very popular. \nIf you book with a reputable adventure holiday company, your family activity break in Les Gets might include a day or two on a ski touring course. These courses cover an introduction to the equipment you will be using, the clothing you need, as well as information about safety on the slopes. You can learn at your own pace and you'll be in safe hands with the experienced local guides. \nYou can also try out sledging on one of the five sledging tracks in the resort, or perhaps embark on a snowshoe expedition with a guide. For absolute beginners, Les Gets has some very good ski schools that will have learners feeling confident and happy on skis in no time. Snowboarders (or would-be snowboarders!) are also catered for, with some ski schools having dedicated snowboard instructors too. \nOff the Snow \nIt's not all about energetic fun on the slopes, however, and as a treat for the adults the Séréni-Cimes Spa is the perfect place to enjoy a hydrotherapy treatment or a massage - perfect after a long day on the slopes. The Haute-Savoie region is also very famous for its cuisine and there are some wonderful specialities to try. From the fondues to the raclettes and the crepes to the baguettes, the mountain food is hearty, satisfying and completely delicious. \nWhether you're an expert sportsperson or with younger children just learning to ski, France is one of the best destinations in Europe for a winter break. But for somewhere that offers a little bit more than the rest, consider the delightful resort of Les Gets for an adventurous and fun family holiday.
