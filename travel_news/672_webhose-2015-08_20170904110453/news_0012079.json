The camera will then return several days a week for the coming weeks.\nRob Foster, Route Level Crossing Manager for Network Rail said: “The council agreed that King Street needed to become one-way because of the risk that traffic would back up onto the level crossing when two vehicles meet on the narrow bridge near Lolham.\n“Although the new traffic flow system has been in place for a month, drivers traveling towards West Deeping appear to be ignoring the clearly marked signs and as a result we have no option but to start prosecuting anyone caught going the wrong way.”\nMotorists are advised that nearby level crossings at Tallington and Maxy remain open and are viable routes for those traveling north. Other crossing alternatives include Bainton, Helpston, as well as Uffington and Barnack.\nSource:-Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:13:45.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
