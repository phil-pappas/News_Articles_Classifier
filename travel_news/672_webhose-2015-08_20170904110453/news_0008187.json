Be adventurous. Give things a chance. And never believe the hype.\nManchester Manchester is a magnet for music heads. With the largest student population in Europe , the city has a wild enthusiasm that’s hard to beat. It’s been home to the Hacienda and acid house, the “Madchester” years and a thriving punk scene. It has given us a huge wealth of musical talent, including the Smiths, Oasis and the Chemical Brothers.\nStudents get sucked into and inspired by the nightlife.\nStuart Forsyth DJ and producer Justin Robertson was a student in Manchester in the 80s and says it is still his favourite city to play in. “I studied in Manchester, and lived there subsequently for 16 years, so it’s always had a special connection for me. The freshness and excitement of that time has stuck with me ever since.”\nTesfa Williams, aka UK house DJ T Williams , agrees. He regularly plays to student crowds across the country and says Manchester is the number one for him. “People still genuinely come out to dance and have a good time. No one’s there with their phones out, they’re out because they know their stuff,” he says.\nThese days, the obvious place to go is the The Warehouse Project (WHP) , a series of events that run every Friday and Saturday from September to January. This year the programme includes the likes of Dixon, New Order, Jamie XX and George FitzGerald.\nNewcomers to the city are warned to avoid ticket touts at all costs. “We strongly advise that students don’t look at any other sites, other than official ones on our website. Sadly, we have experienced people being duped into buying fakes,” says WHP founder Sacha Lord-Marchionne.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clubbers on the main stage at the Hacienda club, Manchester, in 1989.

It’s a pity that other councils across the UK don’t take the same approach,” says Lord-Marchionne.\nLeeds A lot of big artists and DJs either grew up in Leeds or spent time there at university, including the likes of Paul Woolford, Ralph Lawson, Miguel Campbell, Laura Jones, Hot Since 82, Darius Syrossian, Denney, Midland, Pearson Sound, Ben UFO and Pangaea.\nMany students start events themselves, from small nights in clubs or bars like Distrikt or DIY basement, to parties in the student houses of Headingley. “It’s crazy how many Leeds-related DJs have done well over the last few years,” says Stuart Forsyth, event and promotions manager at the Mint Warehouse . “Students get sucked in and inspired by the nightlife.”\nLocals say the city has always had a vibrant and exciting music scene. “Nights like Back to Basics, Hard Times, Up Yer Ronson and the Orbit helped pave the way for all the house and techno nights like System, Dirty Disco, Louche, Prism, Set One Twenty and Circular over the years,” says Forsyth.\nBut it’s not just house music. “There’s a great live music scene as well. Famous parties like Sub Dub have led the way for reggae, drum’n’bass, dancehall, dubstep and jungle music too,” he says.\nTo make the most out of the nightlife, Williams says students should be adventurous and not always follow the hype. “If you feel like seeing a particular DJ or checking out a club night, do it regardless of your mates. You’ll probably end up meeting cool, like-minded people,” he says.\nRobertson agrees. “Just be open-minded. Listen to your mates or go it alone, get immersed and find your beat.”\nGlasgow Facebook Twitter Pinterest Damon Albarn of Blur performs at Barrowlands Ballroom on June 9, 2015 in Glasgow.

But a good gig in Glasgow is known for generating amazing atmosphere, especially at venues such as The Barrowlands , where you can catch acts such as Tame Impala, Future Islands and Hot Chip.\nLocals say the sophisticated club scene is a result of the inherent hedonism of the population. “Historically, Glasgow has had that ‘work hard, play hard’ thing going, just like other post-industrial communities,” says Mike Grieve, the Sub Club managing director. “Add to the mix a large student population, and you can understand why there is an appetite for a party here.”\nNights such as Try I Am on a Tuesday and Subculture on Saturdays at Sub Club provide quality music at affordable prices, where students can catch the likes of Erol Alkan, Richy Ahmed, Mike Dunn and Andy Weatherall.\nBristol Massive Attack, Portishead, Roni Size, Pinch, Joker, Eats Everything and Julio Bashmore all hail from the city and it was very influential in the development of early dubstep. More recently, the popularity of house music has risen dramatically and with this there is a whole host of new, young and exciting producers and promoters pushing the scene forward.\n“The unique venues and diverse music make it a great city to be a student clubber,” says Freddie Norris, programmer for Motion, which runs a series of events held across three warehouses. “Freshers’ week sees Nightmares on Wax play live at Motion, while in the Marble Factory, Ben Klock will play his inimitable brand of Berlin techno all night for local promoters An Evening With.”\nFrom October onwards lineups include everyone from Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac and Chilean techno DJ Ricardo Villalobos, to dance music favourites Bonobo and Groove Armada.\nLondon Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cafe Oto in Dalston, east London.

Venues such as The Windmill in Brixton, and Cafe Oto and Power Lunches in Dalston, play host to a variety of live acts including Fat White Family, Empress Of and Doomsquad.\nMeanwhile, dance music fans are spoilt for choice. Places like Oval Space , the Hydra and Dance Tunnel in east London have a mixed crowd and welcome everyone from students to experienced music connoisseurs.\nDolan Bergin, co-founder of the Hydra – whose upcoming nights include London label Electric Minds at the start of October and Berghain label Ostgut Ton’s 10th anniversary in December – says: “London has one of the richest nightlife offerings in the world. Whether you want to find a band, a headline DJ or an intimate basement to dance with local residents, London has it all.”\nRead more stories in this series:\nStudent societies: sign up and let your imagination run wild Universities for the thrill-seeking student The past’s long shadow sends shivers down student spines Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents – and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.", "external_links": ["http://www.mintwarehouse.co.uk/", "https://twitter.com/gdnstudents", "http://www.dancetunnel.com/", "http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm", "http://the-hydra.net/#home", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bac4%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/hackney-clubs-not-considered-appropriate-370", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bac4%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bac4%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://windmillbrixton.co.uk/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Five+university+cities+with+a+great+nightlife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bac4%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://www.thewarehouseproject.com/home.php", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Five+university+cities+with+a+great+nightlife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bac4%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Five+university+cities+with+a+great+nightlife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bac4%2Fstw%23img-3", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Five+university+cities+with+a+great+nightlife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2015%2Faug%2F20%2Ffive-university-cities-with-a-great-nightlife&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F6%2F1438854190943%2Fb9cbd311-b2a3-496c-bcf7-4e4d268bff7f-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Five+university+cities+with+a+great+nightlife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2015%2Faug%2F20%2Ffive-university-cities-with-a-great-nightlife&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F6%2F1438854507163%2Ffc114973-c771-4054-bc03-0b57b6caa99e-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/twilliamsmusic", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Five+university+cities+with+a+great+nightlife&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2015%2Faug%2F20%2Ffive-university-cities-with-a-great-nightlife&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F6%2F1438854747090%2F30ea6122-7b68-4988-ad6e-ead228ddf8b9-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ha%C3%A7ienda", "http://www.ovalspace.co.uk/", "http://www.mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/200956199-biggest-student-population-europe-set-give-manchester-businesses-much-needed-boost"], "published": "2015-08-20T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:54:38.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
