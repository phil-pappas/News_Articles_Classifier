Daniel Richard told the Herald, \"The case remains under investigation.\"\nThe mess began at 5:15 a.m. and backed up southbound traffic over the Tobin Bridge, as far north as Stoneham on Interstate 93, and also clogged Route 1A into the Ted Williams Tunnel in East Boston with commuters trying to avoid getting stuck.\nIt was a lost cause.\nRichard said the trouble started near Exit 20 to the Massachusetts Turnpike inside the Tip O'Neill when a Mack Truck and a Peterbuilt tractor-trailer, both driven by men from New Hampshire, collided with an Infinity, a Ford LTG and a Honda Civic, all driven by men from Massachusetts.\nThe accident resulted in a ruptured tank on one of the trucks that sent diesel fuel spilling across the highway. The Department of Transportation dispatched sanders to soak it up, Richard said.\nIn \"the same area, same time,\" Richard said four more vehicles became disabled inside the tunnel when a trash hauler lost a large metal door.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:51:00.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
