The Governor said earlier: \"Our courageous firefighters are on the front lines and we'll do everything we can to help them.\" \nThe governor's proclamation directs all state agencies to assist with emergency relief, and activates the state's National Guard to aid with disaster response. Brown also urged California residents to heed any safety warnings from emergency personnel in their area. \nAbout 9,000 firefighters were battling 3,897 fires, 24 were large wildfires in California on Saturday. \nDry thunderstorms were expected to threaten much of Northern California through much of the the weekend/ \nFirefighters have been wading through thick smoke and flying embers to turn loose horses, goats and other livestock in rural neighborhoods as their owners fled to safety, the Associated Press reported. The fast-moving fire had burned three homes by Friday and was threatening 450 other structures. \nIn Napa Valley, a blaze destroyed more than 12 square miles in Solano County but was 92% contained by Saturday, according to CalFire.
