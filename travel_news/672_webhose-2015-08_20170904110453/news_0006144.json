The thought of spending a week living on \"island time\" is one of the main reasons people visit the tropics and even plan destination weddings among the palm trees. Unfortunately what happens for a lot of people is that it takes them a few days to relax, and in that time, they work themselves up trying to figure out how they are going to get everything done that they want to. The best way to handle that is to plan ahead, and if Key West, Florida is your destination, they make it easier than ever to hurry up and relax. The most obvious advantage Key West has over other island resorts is that it is still part of the United States. That means if you need to make a phone call, you do not have to worry about figuring out international dialing codes, and that the internet service there is provided by probably the same company you have at home. This means if you are looking to make reservations at any of the more than 300 Key West restaurants, you can do so easily and without hassle. Of course, if you have not been before you may not know which restaurants you want to eat at, but those decisions can also be made ahead of time. Plenty of review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp offer hundreds of reviews about each location, so not only can you find out who has the freshest seafood and where to get the best key lime pie, you can also find the places with best outdoor dining and patio seating, so you can continue to enjoy the beautiful tropical weather while dining in casual elegance. Another reason to plan ahead is because it is a great way to save money. Companies that offer tours of the island or provide sailing charters for sunsets and snorkeling like to know ahead of time how many people to expect. To make that happen, they often encourage people to book early by offering discounts. This way you can make your plans and save some money at the best time. There is one extra perk to making those plans in advance. The more of the advance planning you do, the less you will need to carry your smartphone around with you while on vacation. Part of relaxing means getting away from it all, and that includes the temptation to check emails, update social media or answer that phone call from your boss. Learning to relax in Key West is an easy thing to do, and if you do it right, you will be relaxing in no time at all. \nJack Terry is a freelance travel and lifestyle writer who lived in Key West for several years. http://www.rooftopcafekeywest.com   08   43  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T14:46:48.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
