(AP) -- A boathouse at Eagle Harbor State Dock in Michigan's Upper Peninsula that serves as a museum has reopened after getting some upgrades. The boathouse reopened last month after its new cedar shingle roof was installed, the state Department of Natural Resources said. The building has been preserved by the Keweenaw County Historical Society, which operates the Life-Saving Station Museum. The old roof had been in place for 77 years, since the boathouse was built. It's listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the work was done in line with federal standards for historic properties, including staining it red to be historically correct. \"We were glad to see a sense of cooperation that developed between the DNR and the Keweenaw County Historical Society during this project,\" Larry Molloy, president of the Keweenaw County Historical Society, said in a statement about the renovations. In addition to roof work, DNR staff dredged boat wells and ramps to return them to the depth and condition of the working life-saving station. The Eagle Harbor Boat House is the only building remaining from the Eagle Harbor Life-Saving Station. The current dock is at the original site of the station, which opened in 1912. It became a U.S. Coast Guard station in 1915 until it was decommissioned after World War II. The Life-Saving Station Museum is open to the public from mid-June to early October. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:28:25.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
