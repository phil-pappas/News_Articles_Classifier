Shortly afterwards we changed our minds about the destination and are now flying to Los Angeles. The Avios scheme allowed us the cancel the Mauritius flights and receive a full refund. The points were re-credited to our BA Executive Club accounts but we have yet to receive a refund of the flight taxes and charges – £667.88. We must have contacted the airline’s customer services team about 20 times to no avail. As we paid the taxes using an American Express card, we asked the firm to find out what was happening. It said it couldn’t help and closed the case on December 30. It is nine months since we cancelled the booking and we appear to have reached a deadlock with BA. Our last contact was on March 10 when we were told the matter was with its refunds department. With a wedding in September we would like the refund soon as it is part of our budget. Please can you help? • 10 ways to win at air travel A reader swapped Mauritius for LA, but was left £667 out of pocket Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Gill Charlton, consumer expert, replies I contacted the airline, which discovered that your refund had fallen between the cracks. “We’re so sorry we let our customer down on this occasion,” said a BA spokeswoman. “We have apologised, organised the refund, and offered a gesture for the delay in processing the payment.” The delay might have had something to do with your contacting American Express. I have come across a number of cases where a customer contacts a credit card provider to help expedite a refund but ends up creating further delays. Often the card provider will apply for a chargeback which stops the usual refund process in its tracks. To avoid repaying the customer twice, further conversations must be had between the airline or travel agent and the card provider. Getting your card provider involved should be a last resort. I would only recommend going down this route if the airline has not processed the refund within six months and give the airline warning before doing so. • Holiday complaints: what to do when travel goes wrong Ask the experts Our Q&A service allows you can pick the brains of our experts at home and abroad.
