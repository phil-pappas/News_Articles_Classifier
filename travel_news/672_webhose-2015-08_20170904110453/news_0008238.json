The Mopar Service Capacity Analyzer is a powerful new online tool that helps dealers to assess, plan and implement changes to the number of technicians, technician hours, stalls and much more to better service customers.\n\"Providing a great customer experience is at the core of what we do,\" said Pietro Gorlier , President and CEO - Mopar Brand Service , Parts and Customer Care, FCA. \"That is why this year alone we have supported the addition of more than 1,300 technicians, 700 service advisors and 500 service bays in our dealer network, which overall is well ahead of our targets. Now, the new Mopar Service Capacity Analyzer offers dealerships a 'road map' to more efficiently utilize these resources by forecasting customer needs out to 2018 based on dealer-specific parameters.\"\nThe algorithm-based Mopar Service Capacity Analyzer allows dealers to adjust physical capacity metrics such as number of technicians/service advisors, technician available hours and stall numbers, to match projected service lane traffic. The dealer can create scenarios and evaluate the changes needed to reach the optimum level of service.\nDealerships can also examine operational efficiency and identify opportunities for improving existing processes and eliminating waste or inefficiencies. A summary page allows quick comparison of how hypothetical plans stack up to current capacity statistics.\nMopar also offers tools to help dealerships implement service capacity changes. The brand is launching a new Service Capacity Guidebook as part of the Service Capacity Analyzer to assist dealers in seizing existing opportunities while avoiding the pitfalls of a crowded service lane.\nAdditional initiatives designed to expand dealer support of the customer experience include the Technician Warranty Exemption Program and Shop Competency Program, which help dealers become more flexible in workflow throughput. The Mopar Career Automotive Program (CAP) works in partnership with automotive tech schools to provide dealerships with a pipeline for recruiting trained and skilled technicians.\n\"The customer journey is about Mopar partnering with our dealers to ensure that we have the tools, the people and the plan to continue to serve those who drive us,\" said Gorlier.\nAbout Mopar Brand\nMopar (a simple contraction of the words MOtor and PARts) was trademarked in 1937 with the launch of an antifreeze product, but it truly made its mark in the 1960s during the muscle-car era. From Mopar Performance Parts to enhance speed and handling for both road and racing use, the brand soon expanded to include technical service and customer support.\nToday, Mopar is FCA's service, parts and customer-care brand and distributes more than 500,000 parts and accessories in over 150 markets around the world. With more than 50 parts distribution centers and 27 customer-contact hubs globally, Mopar integrates service, parts and customer-care operations in order to enhance dealer and customer support worldwide. Mopar is the source for genuine parts and accessories for FCA brands.\nMopar parts are engineered together with the same teams that create factory-authorized specifications for FCA vehicles. This offers a direct connection that no other aftermarket parts company can provide.
