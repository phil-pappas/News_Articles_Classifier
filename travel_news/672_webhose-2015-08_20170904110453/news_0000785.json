And what better place to start gathering evidence than in the toilet?\nEarlier this year I was at a child’s birthday party. I went into the bathroom and locked the door. Within seconds, a five-year-old girl burst in. We’ll call her Jane. Jane’s Dad was not far behind. With my pants and underwear down to my thighs, I jumped to attention and desperately tried to make myself decent.\nI said: “Oh the lock must be broken. I was just going to the toilet.”\n“Jane needs to go to the toilet,” the Dad replied bluntly.\nJane then pulled down her pants and got onto the toilet. The Dad proceeded to stand outside with the door ajar watching his kid pee through the gap, effectively blocking my exit route.\nWithout many reasonable options, I stood there inside the bathroom near the door watching this event for what seemed like an eon.\nUnable to either leave the room or actually go to the toilet myself, my mind raced through a number of questions. Firstly, the obvious problem: “What the hell do I do now?”\nSecondly, there was the blush-inducing thought: “Has this man just seen my bits?”\nI may have been stuck for words, but my toilet companions were not. The Dad continued talking to Jane and she was chatting to him and me as if we were all on a Sunday picnic together.\nAwkward.\nClosely related to toilet stories are incidents involving vomit and public places.\nMy friend Vickie tells me disaster struck when she was shopping at the supermarket for much-needed supplies with two sick children.\n“The baby I was wearing vomited down my cleavage and the other one vomited into the trolley full of fruit and vegetables.\n“This was over 30 years ago and I still feel guilty about ditching the trolley and walking away,” she says.\nDespite all appearances, a supermarket is not a great place to take a child. When my daughter was 18-months-old she smashed a dozen eggs on the floor at Aldi, causing half a dozen other shoppers to stop with their trolleys, stare and grimace.\nSomehow, amid the chaos, Ginger managed to snap this picture of the broken eggs.

We stopped to look at the orang-utans as they scoffed their afternoon tea. A British family with two kids happened to be standing next to us.\nStruck by the human-like qualities of these incredible animals, I said to my four-year-old daughter: “See how the orang-utan’s hands look like ours?”\nThe British woman freaked out because her kids were in earshot and, in a panicky voice, said: “We believe in creation and don’t teach our kids evolution.”\nShe quickly removed her children from my offending presence.\nBe careful what you talk about in the presence of other people’s children! You wouldn’t want them to learn about science, would you? Picture: Toby Zerna Source: News Corp Australia\nYes. Parents — me included — can certainly say and do some strange things. However, perhaps the most mortifying situations arise when your child blurts out inappropriate and personally offensive things.\nRachel says her “most awkward moment was looking at houses to buy.”\n“In a corridor face to face with a lady whose size was such that she took up the whole corridor, Madeline, 2, said: ‘Mummy she is so big!’\n“There was nowhere to hide. I didn’t know what to say or where to look,” Rachel says.\nJust as you don’t really want your child commenting on a stranger’s weight, nor do you want them commenting on a person’s skin colour.\nNicki says she was “overcome with parental shame” when she was waiting at “a very large train station with my nearly four-year-old.”\nThere was a lot of background noise so, speaking very loudly, her daughter piped up: “Mumma, why does that girl have a black face?”\nNicki looked up. To her horror a beautiful, young Sudanese woman was sitting nearby “trying to sink into the floor.”\nIn retrospect Nicki says she wishes she had used this as an “educational lesson on the infinite variation and beautiful diversity of humanity [and] of the evils of racism.” But unfortunately, she didn’t.\n“I panicked. The moment was lost,” she confesses.\nWell, who hasn’t been there? Make us all feel better and spill the beans.
