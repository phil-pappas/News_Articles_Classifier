Not only is it eco-friendly and often cheaper than flying, but train travel provides a perfect way to traverse a country at a relaxed pace, with ample time to soak up the atmosphere, admire the views and chat up the locals along the way. Whether you prefer to travel in deluxe, 5-star cabins or crammed into a rickety carriage with every man and his goat, there’s a railway journey to suit everyone.\nFrom trundling through canyons to an opulent safari-on-wheels or winding down snow-drenched mountains, these are 12 of the world’s most scenic train journeys to fuel your wanderlust. The Flåm Railway, Norway Winding through the wild mountains of Myrdal in Western Norway, the Flåm railway is a tourist spectacle unlike any other. Famed for both its scenic vistas and innovative engineering, the railway tunnels down precipitous mountain slopes into the Flåm Valley.\nThe 20km descent is amongst the steepest in the world, twisting through yawning ravines, cascading waterfalls, remote Nordic farmhouses and snow-dusted mountain peaks. Lasting a short but exhilarating 55 minutes, this is the closest that rail passengers will get to an adrenaline kick. Visit the Flam website for more information and tickets – journeys cost around US$50. \n>> Find flights to Oslo and read our Norway travel guide Canadian Rockies Railway, Canada For sun-speckled lakes and virgin-white peaks, few landscapes are as famed as the Canadian Rockies, and what better way to discover the icy landscape than from the comfort of a plush, heated railway carriage? The Rockies – a UNESCO heritage site – provide a stunning backdrop of shale and limestone peaks as the railway winds through from Alberta to British Columbia.\nVIA offers range of trips, from 3 days at a minimum, from Vancouver to Toronto trip – Beginning at $617 economy. Depending on your time and budget you can book your trip passing through Jasper – Canada’s largest National park, the Columbian ice fields, the Banff, and Yoho National park along its route.

It is no longer available as a public tour but can be booked through the website as a private charter. Whichever route you choose, it’s surely a more relaxing way to discover the Rockies than attempting to scale the high peaks – a feat best left to skilled mountaineers. \n>> Read more about traveling through Canada by train Trans Siberian, Russia It would be impossible to put together a list of the world’s best train journeys without a nod to the Trans Siberian. The railway, spanning some 6,000 miles, is not only the world’s longest but also one of the most popular – a journey that features on many traveler’s wish lists. Chugging at snail pace through rugged Russian landscapes and vast Siberian plateaus, the Trans Siberian also branches into Mongolia and China, offering a varied trans-continental experience.\nThere are numerous options for travelers from first-class package deals running into the thousands including stopovers with local tours and excursions, to the cheaper DIY hop-on-hop-off approach where you’ll probably find yourself piled in with the locals and practicing your Russian over a stiff drink. Seat 61 offers an excellent guide to navigating the Trans-Siberian, planning your itinerary and booking your tickets. \n>> Book flights to Moscow and learn about things to do in the South of Russia Cusco to Machu Picchu, Peru The Inca ruins of Machu Picchu are perhaps most famous for the grueling 3-4 day trek that leads ambitious hikers up through the Andes, climbing to a nausea-inducing 4, 200m above sea level. Thankfully, for the less adventurous (or lazier) sightseer, there is another quicker and decidedly more comfortable route up the mountains, by train.\nA few choices are available, from the cheap and simple backpacker trains (around US$125 round trip) to the opulent and considerably pricier gold and blue Hiram Bingham train (about US$800 round trip including meals), christened after the explorer who first uncovered the lost Inca city. Whatever your budget, the spectacular scenery is unlikely to disappoint – an immense backdrop of craggy mountains and alpaca-filled fields set against the rippling waters of the Urubamba river. All that before you even get to the main attraction. Visit Peru rail website for booking details.

The railway line weaves through the Scottish highlands, following stretches of deserted coastline and parading a slideshow of thatched roofed hamlets, rolling glens, eerily calm lochs, and acres of unblemished countryside.\nA range of different journeys are on offer, from 2 to 7 day tours, and although the extravagant price tags – anything from around US$1300 dollars for 2 nights up to $14,000 for a 8 day trip – may not be a hit with budget travelers, the prices are inclusive of food, alcohol and sight-seeing excursions – including traditional Scottish pastimes like salmon fishing and whisky tasting. And with only 36 guests on-board, a top sous chef whipping up dinner and plush private cabins, it’s likely that you’ll get your money’s worth.

With gold-tinted windows, butler service, marble floor tiles and carriages that could pass as 5-star hotel suites, it’s no wonder that the train has played host to numerous presidents and royalty over the years.\nRunning 1,600 km between Cape Town and Pretoria, the sapphire-blue carriages tunnel through rolling mountains and thick forest, passing by desert plains where giraffes, elephants and zebras roam.

Known by many names, the ‘Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico’, ‘El Chepe’ or simply the ‘Copper Canyon Railway’ offers the simplest yet non-the-less spectacular way to traverse the famous canyon. Running from Los Mochis to the Copper Canyon, the train cruises through some 87 tunnels and over 37 bridges, through the Tarahumara Mountains to Chihuahua. The real highlight though, is the winding track climbing high out of the canyon, with peaks reaching 2,400m above sea level.\nDramatic vistas aside, this is no luxury affair – the trains are simple, sparse and offer few luxuries (or necessities for that matter – bring your own toilet paper). Serving a wide mix of locals as well as tourists, the railway can be a great way to interact with the locals and at around 16 hours each way, there’s plenty of time to practice your Spanish in-between gawping at the landscape. Both a first class express train and a 2nd class ‘local’ train run daily – visit the El Chepe website for schedule and ticket information. Expect to pay around US$100 for the cheapest full-journey tickets. \n>> Search airfare to Mexico or read about great short trips in Mexico The Glacier Express, Switzerland A leisurely and visually delightful way to reach your ski resort, or simply to enjoy the views, Switzerland’s Glacier Express railway is possibly Europe’s most scenic train route.

Wintertime is the best time to travel, when the snowfall leaves the countryside drenched in white, but the picturesque landscapes and quaint villages hold their own at any time of the year.\nFor those looking for a quick-fix dose of Swiss magic, this one train ride spans almost the whole of Southern Switzerland and checks numerous boxes off the sightseeing list – crossing both the Rhone and the Rhine rivers, the towering Matterhorn mountain, the deep ravines of Gotthard Pass and climbing to 2033m over the Oberalp Pass.
