As it was, I'd already learned a few things to be freaked out about thanks to my newfound fearful friends. \n'Wait! What's that on the wing!' \nOn the first night he told us, \"I don't have the cure.\" That was a blow. He said, \"People get a cure when they decide to change.\" \nBeing afraid of flying is kind of like having a sore body part, going to physio and then being given a list of boring exercises that most don't do, though if they did they would find it helped. When you hate flying so much that you find yourself in a cold room after hours for four long nights, you know you're in the minority that's willing to do the exercises. With the backup, of course, that if all else fails, you'll be heading straight to the bar next time you're at the airport lounge. \nAmos says relaxation is number one priority for the fearful flyer. Just relax! Saying this to an anxious person will never inspire their breakthrough moment. Amos has stood in front of enough of us to know this, so he spent time expanding on the whole relaxation idea. He said exercises help, and we did some: breathing techniques. He said reigning in the emotions and being more reasoned helps – that one's more of a lifelong goal. All of them take time and practice. \nHe said anxious people are often busy and they need to learn to be passengers, to allow themselves time off. When Amos hops on a plane, he's relaxed by the thought that getting to the destination is not his problem. That's a big problem for me, but different strokes, I guess. \nHe said it's important to change the narrative. So instead of telling your worst flight story at dinner parties, or listening to others talk about theirs, stay positive about it. He told us to wake up on the morning of a trip and say, \"Wow! Today I'm flying.\" When a woman in the audience piped up and repeated his words with a downward inflection, the meaning changed, and all of us flight fearers laughed. \n\"Treat yourself like a psychological diabetic,\" said Amos. \"There's no cure, only management.\" \nWe learnt survival tips from the Grant Amos toolkit. While breathing helps (on the plane and in life), so does wiggling the toes during take off, or whenever, really. This is supposed to prevent you from being able to tense up and try to grip on to the floor, and it's also a bit distracting. Distraction helps. Sitting with your bum right back in the seat helps, with the seatbelt fastened tightly so that you can move with the plane. \nAmos always carries a bag of Oddfellow mints when flying. They force you to breathe through your nose. Hydration helps, but it has the unfortunate side effect that you will potentially tip the plane over when moving to the bathroom. He said this is impossible, but I don't fully believe him so please stay still. He also said it's impossible to be sucked down the toilet and out of the plane. That's something. Chewing gum on descent helps. Statistics don't. \"Statistics make you a highly knowledgeable bad flyer, they don't change your feelings.\" Just in case they help you, I will report you would be bloody unlucky to die in a plane crash: More than 3.3 billion people flew safely on 38 million flights last year. There were 73 crashes, and 641 died. I asked him if any of the 7000 people who have taken his course have died in a plane crash and immediately regretted it when he said no – does that mean it's more likely that I could be the one? \nOn Friday night we graduated and were given cute Fly Without Fear badges, and a woman asked if this was so our bodies could be identified more easily if we wore them on flights. Christ almighty. He should've taken her badge back. \nOn the Saturday six of us flew return from Tauranga to Auckland with Amos, armed with our toolkits. We arrived and all agreed we had barely slept because it was so windy out. We thought the flight would be cancelled. We prayed the flight would be cancelled. \nIt was bumpy. Our mouths were stuffed with Oddfellow mints. We chatted happily until the first bounce, then Amos took over and did the talking. \"Wiggle your toes! It's not turbulence, it's the plane rising and returning! It's not bad, it's interesting! Relax!\" A woman looked at the group of us like we were outpatients and one of us told her what we were doing. At the end she took each of our hands and said, \"Well done; you made it.\" It was silly and we knew it, but we were kind of proud. \nPeople keep asking me if I'm cured. Only business class has the power to heal me completely. Until the day my bank balance allows it, I'll make do with the Amos toolkit, the relax mantra, and some solid time at the airport bar. - Sunday Magazine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:34:48.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
