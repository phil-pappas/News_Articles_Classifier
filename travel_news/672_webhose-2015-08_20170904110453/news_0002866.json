Sign Up Now! Use our western Turkey travel map to plan your vacation to Turkey \nTurkey has a lot to recommend for the traveler on a budget. The seas are bright and blue, the archaeological sites are some of the best preserved in the world, and there is value for the dollar in Turkey. \nMost first time visitors to Turkey keep to the western side of Turkey, mostly to the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, where a blue cruise can be an inexpensive way to sea the largely unspoiled coastline. \nThe circles on the map represent towns to visit in Turkey, the red squares represent the top archaeological sites to visit in Turkey. Entry Points into Western Turkey \nThere are large airports at Istanbul [AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST)] and Ankara [Esenboga Airport (ESB)]. For the itineraries suggested here, the smaller airports at Izmir [Adnan Menderes Airport (ADB)] and Antalya Airport (AYT) would work. The coastal towns of Bodrum and Kusidasi are easily reached by a short ferry ride from Greek islands, Bodrum from Kos or Rhodes , and Kusadasi from nearby Samos . Things to do in Western Turkey - Cruising on a Gulet \nOne of the most popular things is to cruise on a yacht designed for entertaining people on Turkish waters, called a gulet. There's lots of deck space in a gulet for the passengers. So, you sign up for what's known as a Blue Cruise and you're off on an adventure. Archaeology in Turkey \nThe archaeological sites on the map are quite well preserved. Visitors who arrive in Kusadasi by ferry from the Greek island of Samos ( see route ) can easily get to Ephesus , once a very important center for trade in the Mediterranean before the harbor silted up. Visit the theater, so well preserved that it's still used, and don't forget to take the obligatory picture of the ancient toilets near the brothel. There are many guided day trip tours from Kusadasi . \nThe blisteringly white terraced pools of Pamukkale's hot springs , the result of thousands of years of deposits by the calcium rich hot springs and the Ancient city of Hierapolis, a World Heritage Site, aren't far away from the coast either. \nVisitors wishing to venture a little further out can visit the archaeological sites of ancient Aphrodisias , Pergamum , Troy and Sardis as well. Cappadocia \nThis popular area in volcanic central Turkey, where erosion of the soft tufa has resulted in spectacular landscapes and easy to build caves and carved structures, is a very popular place to visit for a few days. You'll want plenty of time to visit the GÃ¶reme Open-air museum with its carved churches, the Ihlara Valley, the underground cities of KaymaklÃ½ or Derinkuyu, the fairy chimneys, Zelve and ÃrgÃ¼p. A popular endeavor is to see it all from above, on a balloon tour of Cappadocia. [ Cappadocia Resources ] Long Distance Trails in Turkey The first long-distance route in Turkey was the Lycian Way, launched 10 years ago. Its popularity has inspired other Turkish and international trail-builders--and today there are many cultural routes to follow. You'll find them at Culture Routes in Turkey . \nAlong the Lycian Way are the Lycian tombs that have become a symbol of Dalyan , which offers a variety of other attractions, including an ancient Roman site as well as mud baths and a Loggerhead Turtle nesting area.
