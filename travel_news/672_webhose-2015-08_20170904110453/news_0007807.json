The huge Meydan One Mall will feature 540,000 square meters of luxury and premium brand retail outlets. \nVisitors and residents can also cool off at the Crystal Lagoon water park, a 100-berth marina and 300 meters of sandy beach. \nMeydan One Mall -- because of course there's a mall -- will be home to 652 stores. \nWalking through its many aisles should offer the site's planned 78,300 residents entertainment and exercise enough, but there's also a 25,000-square-meter indoor sports facility and 8,000-capacity venue. \nThe estimated $8.6 billion scheme is scheduled for completion in time for the UAE's hosting of World EXPO 2020, with construction already underway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T14:27:02.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
