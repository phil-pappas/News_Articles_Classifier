The partnership makes Flybe’s ‘One Stop to the World’ proposition a convenient reality with bookings that can be instantly made via a direct link from its website www.flybe.com powered by Skyscanner.\nThe powerful bespoke search tool, developed for Flybe by Skyscanner for Business, a suite of products that is helping to power the travel internet, calculates all options available for flying to selected long haul destinations from many of the key regional airports served by Flybe. It detais all possible itineraries, timings and convenient connections. Skyscanner for Business developed the new search engine utilising its White Label product, which easily customised the tool to the Flybe branding that users are familiar with.\nOnce a travel choice had been made, customers can immediately click through and complete their flight purchase direct with the relevant codeshare carrier’s website. These currently include Aer Lingus, Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad, Finnair and KLM.\nExamples of the extensive choice of long-haul destinations served by Flybe’s codeshare partners include Dubai with Emirates via Birmingham, Manchester and London Gatwick; and to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific via Manchester and Paris CDG.\nFlybe’s Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Simmons says: “Our new partnership with Skyscanner fully leverages a wealth of travel possibilities available by combining Flybe’s own extensive route network with those offered by our increasing number of codeshare partners. Today’s news represents a major strategic step forward for Flybe, as well as a significant milestone in globe-trotting travel options for our customers.”\nThe partnership is the first time Skyscanner has provided a White Label solution to an airline, and comes off the back of several other recent deals the travel search engine has made to provide its solutions to large brands, such as Microsoft.\nSkyscanner’s Director of Business Development, Hugh Aitken comments: “Flybe came to us with a unique problem and we are thrilled to be able to launch this tailored product today. Through our best-in-class White Label product, matched with our comprehensive global reach, we’ve been able to develop a simple solution for Flybe that makes travel planning and booking as easy as possible.”\nAdds Mr Simmons: “Flybe has long been offering ‘One Stop to the World’ travel options for our passengers with seamless onward travel. Now that dream destination is even easier to find and plan.\n“This powerful new search tool reinforces our commitment to empowering our customers with as much information about the enormous choice of itineraries they now have – and all on their doorsteps from their own regional airport.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T03:24:02.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
