The main protagonist was famous for her match-making skills, a trait she apparently inherited from Jane Austen herself.\nThe Jane Austen Festival\nThe Jane Austen Festival includes dance and etiquette workshops, concerts, and talks about Jane Austen and Regency Life. The main highlight in the Jane Austen Festival social calendar is the ‘Regency Costumed Masked Ball’ which takes place on 18th September at The Pump Room. Tickets cost £90.\nTo celebrate the bicentenary of ‘Emma’ a second ball, the ‘Highbury Country Dance’, will take at The Pavilion on 12th September at The Pavilion (Regency dress not compulsory). Tickets cost £43.\nThe Paragon\nJane Austen’s first real experience of Bath was when she went to stay at No. 1 The Paragon in her uncle and aunt’s home, the first time for a visit and the second for the purpose of house-hunting in Bath.\nYou can stay at The Paragon Georgian Townhouse, which is the building right next door to where Jane Austen resided in 1797 and 1801. This luxury self-catering accommodation allows you to have complete use of your very own Georgian townhouse. Sit back and relax and take in views of Bathwick Hill and Sham Castle from the huge Georgian bay windows.\nJane Austen’s Home\nAs the name suggests, Jane Austen’s Home was the Bath family residence from 1801 to 1804. The property has since then been divided up into stylish apartments, so you can choose to stay in different parts of the house, such as ‘Mr Darcy’s Apartment’, which is where Jane Austen had her bedroom.\nThe property is also where Jane reputedly wrote ‘Northanger Abbey’ whilst gazing out of her bedroom window at Sydney Gardens, the place for the fashionable people of Bath to meet and be seen, an outdoor space notorious for its balls, supper parties, concerts and musical breakfasts.\nSydney Gardens\nSydney Gardens, formerly ‘The Pleasure Gardens’, were laid out with the purpose of being a commercial pleasure garden, built behind the Sydney Hotel (now The Holburne Museum), which was intrinsic to Bath’s social scene. Jane Austen was an avid walker and enjoyed walking these gardens throughout her time living in Bath.\nThe gardens are still open to the public and feature tennis courts, flowerbeds and a replica of the Temple of Minerva, making it the ideal spot for a stroll or a picnic. There is also a path that leads down to the Kennet & Avon Canal.\nThe Pump Room\nThe Pump Room was where high society used to go for afternoon tea and to be seen about town. A favourite haunt of Jane herself, it also features in ‘Northanger Abbey’ and ‘Persuasion’.\nThe Pump Room Restaurant today is still a hugely popular place for afternoon tea or lunch. You can also have a glass of Bath’s very own thermal waters straight from the fountain, for which many visitors travel from afar to benefit from its many healing properties.\nThe Assembly Rooms\nThe Assembly Rooms were used for public concerts, assemblies and public balls. Many eligible men and women would gather and dance the night away providing them with an ideal stylish backdrop to court. Jane Austen featured the Assembly Rooms in ‘Persuasion’ and attended some of the balls herself, drawing upon her own experiences for her writing.\nToday the rooms are used for various events from catwalks to weddings. The Bath Fashion Museum is also located there, where visitors can look at exquisite Georgian dress and try on a corset and bonnet or three!\nSource:-VisitBath", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:13:12.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
