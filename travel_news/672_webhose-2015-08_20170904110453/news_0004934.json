Source: Supplied\n“Being a tile from Pompeii, its provenance might have given it some extra value, but I’d say it’s worth a maximum of €400 (about $600) ... but obviously items like this are priceless in terms of their historical value.”\nThough the tile was given back to Pompeii staff, neither the teenager or the American tourist who caught him trying to take the item could remember the original location of the piece so it may take some time before it’s properly restored.\nThis story originally appeared on Fox News .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "http://www.thelocal.it/20150811/dutch-teen-steals-pompeii-tile-to-raise-iphone-cash", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Tourist+stole+artefact+so+he+could+buy+an+iPhone&c=IN+THE+latest+dumb+tourist+act%2C+a+teenager+has+been+busted+stealing+a+priceless+artefact+from+the+ancient+city+of+Pompeii%2C+all+so+he+could+buy+the+latest+iPhone.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/tourist-stole-artefact-to-buy-an-iphone/story-e6frfqbr-1227484453522?sv=b80202b66158ee833d40222c0204c8ab", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/tourist-stole-artefact-to-buy-an-iphone/story-e6frfqbr-1227484453522?sv=b80202b66158ee833d40222c0204c8ab&h=Tourist+stole+artefact+so+he+could+buy+an+iPhone", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/tourist-stole-artefact-to-buy-an-iphone/story-e6frfqbr-1227484453522?sv=b80202b66158ee833d40222c0204c8ab&title=Tourist+stole+artefact+so+he+could+buy+an+iPhone", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/tourist-stole-artefact-to-buy-an-iphone/story-e6frfqbr-1227484453522?sv=b80202b66158ee833d40222c0204c8ab&title=Tourist+stole+artefact+so+he+could+buy+an+iPhone", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/tourist-stole-artefact-to-buy-an-iphone/story-e6frfqbr-1227484453522?sv=b80202b66158ee833d40222c0204c8ab", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/tourist-stole-artefact-to-buy-an-iphone/story-e6frfqbr-1227484453522?sv=b80202b66158ee833d40222c0204c8ab", "http://www.ilmattino.it/NAPOLI/CRONACA/scavi_di_pompei_16enne_olandese_ruba_reperto_voleva_venderlo_su_ebay_e_comprare_iphone/notizie/1510966.shtml"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T20:15:46.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
