(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool) \nBollywood diva Kareena Kapoor Khan brought the curtains down at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2015 showcasing ace designer Gaurav Gupta's line on Sunday. Reacting to the compliments she received at the event, she said that her husband, Saif Ali Khan, surely is a \"lucky man\" to have her in his life. When asked how Saif reacts to the compliments that she receives, Kareena said, \"I think it's the biggest compliment for Saif. He is a lucky man for sure.\" It was the first time that Kareena and Gaurav collaborated for a fashion show. The 34-year-old actor looked her stunning best as she walked down the ramp wearing a black flowing sheer gown, a piece from the designer's collection, which was in tandem with Lakme's Sculpt line. Kareena, whose outfit was a playful juxtaposition of Gaurav's signature drapes and structure, said she loves working with new designers like him. \"It's very interesting to collaborate with new designers every time during the finale. I admire the novelty and quirk that new designers like Gaurav bring to the table. I think the fashion industry needs such creative minds,\" Kareena said. Keeping with the theme of the show, the designs, which were all women's wear, consisted of sculpting with fabric as well as on stage. A huge installation of a lady was set up in the middle of the circular stage. Models one-by-one emerged from the small pit inside the statue and spread out on the runway, which also consisted of stairs. The piano and cello added to the tempo of the show as models walked to its rhythm at Mehboob Studio. \"It was an exciting pressure to be a finale designer. It is a first for me. We celebrate our decade today and Lakme celebrates its 15 years. The music was very unique because we did a very artistic setting. The clothes are also very sculptural. We kept the music romantic and (such) which fills large spaces in a beautiful way,\" Gaurav said. Dune-like textures featured in the garments through boning and silver rivulets and large ruffles swayed through the drapes. The fabrics used were mostly neoprene, tulle, silks and georgettes in colours like gray, black, ivory and red. The show, however, was low on celebrity turn out with only Dia Mirza, Aditi Rao Hydari, Prateik Babbar, Shriya Saran, Zayed Khan in attendance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:37:26.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
