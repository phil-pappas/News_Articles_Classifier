Fading? Poor you. Of all human frailties, the one least likely to engender sympathy is deafness. To those who suffer from it, it can be isolating and debilitating ; to those who find themselves in the company of the hard of hearing it can be an irritation and an inconvenience. And yet it is one of lifeâ€™s greatest injustices that we often have little sympathy for those with hearing loss, especially when it is seen as partial, and when it has crept up on the sufferer with age. In all families, there are those who, with advancing years, have become less responsive to our questions and for whom conversation is a battlefield. Unless their interlocutor is looking straight at them, allowing them to lip-read, misunderstandings can occur. Richard Pryor is deaf in the American comedy, See No Evil, Hear No Evil Photo: Film Stills That said, any man over 50 can avail himself of selective hearing and sidestep requests to complete jobs around the house. Sometimes the deafness that comes with age can give rise to humour, but those brief moments are unlikely to compensate for the frustration endured most of the time. Today, much can be done to alleviate such suffering, and hearing aids are more effective and less obtrusive than the hearing trumpets of old.

How often have you slid your cupped hand behind your ear to better receive dialogue aimed in your direction? It is easy to do over dinner, but trickier standing up and holding a glass.

Better, perhaps, to decline such junkets in favour of meals with a small group of friends who will be easier to understand. Even so, deafness will affect most of us as we age, and it would be nice to think that we can be understanding, rather than impatient, of those who suffer from it already. There are times when Mrs T suggests that my auditory powers are not what they were. I pooh-poo the notion. But last week I visited the doctor for a check-up, and aside from checking my blood pressure and asking how often I exercise, he asked me about my hearing. I tried to reassure him, but I feel a syringing session coming on. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T09:13:20.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
