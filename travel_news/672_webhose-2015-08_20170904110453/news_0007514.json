(Bloomberg photo) - + Japan railway appoints cat as stationmaster TOKYO â€” The number of foreign passenger arrivals in Japan reached 1,918,400 in July, the highest monthly total on record and a 51% surge from a year earlier, government data showed Wednesday. \nThe total at the start of the summer vacation season surpassed the previous monthly record high of 1,764,691 set in April, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO). \nMeanwhile, a record 11.05 million foreigners are estimated to have visited Japan from January to July, up 46.9% from the same period last year, moving closer to the annual goal of 20 million that the government seeks to achieve by 2020 when Tokyo will host the Olympics and Paralympics. \nThe JNTO attributed the surge in foreign visitor arrivals to a weaker yen and an increase in the number of large cruise ships as well as charter flight services to Japan. \nThe 23rd World Scout jamboree is also believed to have contributed to the growth, as over 30,000 participants from around the world converged in the western Japan prefecture of Yamaguchi from July 28 to Aug 8. \nBy country and region, Chinese travellers more than doubled to 2.76 million in the January-July period, the largest share of the total, followed by 2.16 million from South Korea and 2.15 million from Taiwan. \nThe government has been stepping up efforts to attract foreign visitors to prop up the Japanese economy through measures such as easing visa rules and expanding the scope of duty-free shopping. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
