Helicopter Yoga On a Deserted Island In Partnership with VisitFlorida.com \nA deserted island offers the perfect environment for yoga, right? Sun, sand, the sounds of wind and waves — the only problem is that deserted islands tend to be, you know, not so conveniently located. Enter heli-yoga. \nEnjoy an aerial meditation as a Str8 Up Aviation helicopter lifts you over a beautiful coastline and backwaters, landing at a remote, otherwise inaccessible location to enjoy a private instructor-led yoga practice. After a blissful savasana bathed in the sounds of your peaceful outdoor surroundings, healthy, organic refreshments are served before you take a stroll to enjoy the natural beauty — and then your exhilarating helicopter experience continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T01:56:13.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
