The guide also highlights the airline regulations relating to how the dress needs to be packed and whether any additional baggage options are available to couples.\nAll of the 15 airlines in the study were found to allow wedding dresses to be transported as hand luggage although 14 of the airlines offer no additional baggage allowance for the bride, meaning the dress must still remain within the individual airlines’ luggage policy. Meanwhile, couples who have booked a wedding package through Thomas Cook are entitled to 11kgs hand luggage spread across two bags for each person travelling, instead of the usual policy of 6kgs in one bag.\nFor those brides happy to transport their wedding dress as part of their checked luggage allowance, most of the airlines apply normal checked baggage rules whereas couples who have booked a Thomson Wedding are entitled to an extra 5kgs of checked luggage free of charge. For those travellers flying with flybe and opting for a traditional Scottish wedding abroad, they must be aware that the kilt pin and sgian gubh (sock knife) can only be carried as checked luggage for obvious security reasons.\nWhen it comes to the all-important packing of the wedding dress, airlines such as Air Canada, British Airways, Lufthansa and US Airways recommend that the dress is packed in a foldable garment bag to reduce creases and damage during the flight. Whereas, Virgin Atlantic require the dress to be packed in a separate suitcase marked ‘fragile wedding garments’ if it is to travel in the hold.\nIn terms of special assistance whilst onboard, brides travelling with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic can request for their dress to be hung in the wardrobe storage area if space is available. Meanwhile, Ryanair will go one step further and allow passengers to book an additional seat for their dress for the duration of the flight. Passengers must note that if they require an extra seat for their wedding dress with Ryanair, they must pay the full ticket price for the seat occupied.\nThree of the 15 airlines compared in the survey, including Aer Lingus, easyJet and flybe, also allow passengers to bring their wedding cakes onboard. For those travelling with Aer Lingus, there is the option of checking the cake in or carrying it as hand luggage whereas with easyJet, wedding cakes can only be carried as hand luggage and stored in the overhead locker or under the seat, but not on the passenger’s lap. Meanwhile, passengers with flybe on an international flight must contact the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) to ensure they are allowed to export their wedding cake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:01:58.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
