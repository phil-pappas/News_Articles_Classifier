Currently, the cruise line’s 3,807-guest Mariner of the Seas makes around 30 voyages annually. Her next Singapore season which will be the largest ever starting from this October, will feature more long cruises of seven to 15 nights, aimed at attracting more overseas fly-cruise guests.\nSean Treacy, Managing Director, Singapore and Southeast Asia of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. said: “Having deployed ships here regularly for the last seven years, Royal Caribbean now looks forward to its next phase of significant growth in Singapore. Our three-year deployment plan is our strongest commitment ever to this market and we see great potential in Singapore as a source market and regional cruise hub. We highly appreciate this collaboration which will be a tremendous support for our business goals in Singapore and Southeast Asia, as well as the strong efforts of the Singapore Government for being so proactive in driving the cruise business in the country.”\nProjected to generate over $100 million in tourism receiptsi , the collaboration with Royal Caribbean contributes substantially to Singapore’s cruise industry, with an estimated compounded annual growth of 5 to 8 per cent in throughput over the next three to four years. With the cruise industry already generating more than $500 million in direct spendingii in 2013, this development promises a further injection of significant economic impact into Singapore.\nWhat is equally important is the growing interest in cruising in Southeast Asia. With more than 25,000 islands, Southeast Asia is an ideal cruising destination for travellers seeking to discover multiple cultures and new experiences in a warm, tropical year-round climate. The region appeals particularly strongly to Asian travellers due to its close proximity to home, with eight in 10iii who have never cruised before expressing interest to embark on a cruise vacation within Southeast Asia. Said Ms Neeta Lachmandas, Assistant Chief Executive (Business Development Group), Singapore Tourism Board: “The tripartite collaboration is a significant development not just for Singapore but also for Southeast Asia.\nWe hope Royal Caribbean’s commitment will inspire new cruise itineraries around the region to offer more reasons for travellers to take to cruising, and also motivate our neighbouring ports and destinations to invest and realise fully the tremendous potential of the Asian cruise industry.”\nProviding a link between Royal Caribbean International, Singapore and its regional neighbours is Changi Airport’s strong connectivity to 320 cities worldwide, along with some 6,700 weekly flights, giving Singapore a strategic advantage to effectively tap fly-cruise traffic from across the globe and serve as a cruise hub for Asia.\nCAG’s Senior Vice President for Market Development, Mr Lim Ching Kiat, said: “This collaboration represents the synergistic efforts by CAG, Royal Caribbean and STB to effectively tap fly-cruise traffic from across the globe and serve as a cruise hub for Asia. Changi Airport will continue to leverage on its network and work with airlines and travel agents to promote fly-cruise packages through Singapore.”\nSource:- Changi Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:14:00.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
