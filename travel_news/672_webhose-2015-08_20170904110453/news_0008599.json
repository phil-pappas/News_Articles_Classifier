Source: AP\nMICHAEL Clarke tried to dig his heels in and rescue Australia’s pathetic first innings batting collapse.\nHe fought his way to 10 from 15 balls - the first Australian batsman to make it to double figures - but it was barely a speed bump to England destroyer Stuart Broad.\nClarke fell after edging to Alastair Cook at first slip.\nIt gave Broad his fifth scalp with the stunning figures of 5-6 from 3.1 overs and left Australia out of the contest at 6-29.\n8.20PM - SHAUN MARSH AND ADAM VOGES FALL\nShaun Marsh failed in his return.

Source: Getty Images\nAUSTRALIAN selectors have rolled the dice on Shaun Marsh after sensationally dropping his brother Mitchell for the fourth Ashes Test at Nottingham.\nThe selection means the Australian batting order will get a massive shake-up with captain Michael Clarke dropping to No. 5 and Marsh stepping into the No. 4 spot.\nIt means Australia will have just four recognised bowlers to get the job done with Clarke confirming as much at the toss of the coin.\n“Shaun Marsh in for Mitchell Marsh,” Clarke said.\n“Obviously it strengthens our batting having a very good and an in-form batsman in Shaun Marsh and we rely on obviously three fast bowlers and Nathan Lyon as well.\n“I’ll bat at No. 5, Shaun will bat at No. 4.\n“It’s as big as every other game I’ve played for Australia. You can only do your best. You can only work as hard as you can. Now it’s about getting out there and enjoying the challenge.\n“We have to bat well. I sense a similar feeling to what we had before the start of Lord’s (the Test Australia won by 405 runs). Now we have to come out and execute like that.”\nEngland captain Alastair Cook won the toss and elected to bowl, sending Chris Rogers and David Warner out to the middle to face the heat.\nEngland also made one change from the side that won the third Test at Edgbaston with Mark Wood re-called for the injured James Anderson.\nFOLLOW OUR LIVE COVERAGE BELOW:\nDay 1 - 4th Ashes Test (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1413883&ThemeId=27311 .)\nOriginally published as Australia’s embarrassing Ashes bloodbath", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227473/166098-a70ad2c2-3c1d-11e5-8ba6-37d94aa5cd16.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227473/200091-1b9aa7ca-3c23-11e5-8ba6-37d94aa5cd16.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227473/234190-07fd0a12-3c1b-11e5-8ba6-37d94aa5cd16.jpg", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1413883&ThemeId=27311", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/the-ashes-2015-live-blog-from-the-fourth-test-at-nottingham-australia-and-england/story-fndpt0dy-1227473148402", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227473/216253-b78f8200-3c1d-11e5-8ba6-37d94aa5cd16.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-07T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:15:18.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
