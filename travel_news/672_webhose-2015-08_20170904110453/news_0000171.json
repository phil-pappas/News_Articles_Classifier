In a continued effort to branch out and expand options for worldly travelers to and from Nevis, a new deal has been struck that will add United Airlines to the roster of available airlines to choose from when doing so. \nUnited Airlines announced that it will be launching its inaugural non-stop service from its Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) hub to Robert L. Bradshaw International (SKB) beginning on December 19, 2015 and with regular connections by Water taxi and ferries, visitors will be unpacked and on the beach with ample time for an early rum punch. \nFlights are scheduled to operate through April 30, 2016 on Saturdays weekly. United will dedicate a 737- 800 aircraft with capacities ranging from 154-166 for the flights depending on bookings. These twinjet airliners derived from Boeing’s 707 and 727 are the industry standard for medium-range narrow-body aircraft. \nUA 1925 will begin on December 19 with departures leaving Newark Liberty International (EWR) at 9:00 AM and arriving in Robert L. Bradshaw International (SKB) at 2:10 PM. The same flight (UA 1925) will depart Bradshaw International at 3:05 PM to arrive back at Newark Liberty by 6:35 PM, just in time for dinner. \nWith the addition of this new airlift service, a more convenient and flexible list of options are making themselves available to prospective travelers. The Hon. Mark Brantley, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Aviation for Nevis & St. Kitts as well as Deputy Premier of Nevis has made convenience to and from the Federation and to Nevis in particular, an important component of his portfolio responsibility since assuming office. \nIn a recent interview regarding the new service, he stated, “The Northeastern U.S. has historically been our largest source market for visitors and these new flights allow for more connections from key gateways in and near this region.” \nAdditionally, United Airlines provides services connecting Nevis with Chicago O’Hare International (ORD), Washington D.C’s Reagan National Airport (DCA) and Dulles International (IAD), Baltimore, Washington International Airport (BWI), and Boston Logan International (BOS). United Airlines, like a few of its competitors, are realizing the benefit of creating strong partnerships and opening air travel throughout the Caribbean with smaller nations such as Nevis. \n“This addition will mark United’s 18th Caribbean destination from our domestic airports, offering more flexibility and choice for our flyers traveling to the region,” said Director of Leisure Sales for United Airlines, Vic Kerckhoff. \nBuilding on Kerckhoff’s remarks, Hon. Mark Brantley added, “…the additional United Airlines flight from Newark is an integral component in our strategy to provide non-stop airlift from our key international gateways…” pointing out that, “…our visitor research and stakeholder input have indicated that New Jersey is a very strong market for Nevis.” \nClosing, he stated that “Although this marks a very important step in the expansion and building of Nevis’ influence and connection with the rest of the world and in particular the American market, we still have much work to do. Nevis is not merely my home, it is a jewel that the world should have access to. My administration and I will not rest until we have exercised and unlocked all available and unavailable opportunities in order to make this dream a reality. With every connection, we get one step closer to achieving our ultimate goal.” \nHotel bookings for Nevis can be made via the Nevis website . \nFlight arrangements can be made via the United website . \nAbout United Airlines: \nUnited Airlines and United Express operate an average of nearly 5,000 flights a day to 362 airports across six continents.
