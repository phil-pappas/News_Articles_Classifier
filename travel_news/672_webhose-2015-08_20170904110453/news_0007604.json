The women are putting a smile on tourists’ faces and pulling in some coin.

I am doing something many people like,” Pamela Peña, 23, told Fox News Latino . \n“When I paint myself, people surround me, I bring smiles to people’s faces. \n“When Times Square is packed, the people feel joyful, happy, the people laugh because they see us painted.” \nThe women — known as desnudas — say they work up to 12 hours a day and make about $US300. Despite the alleged clampdown by de Blasio, even NYPD cops have been pictured stopping and posing with the mainly Latina women. A woman gets ready for a day’s work in New York’s Times Square.

Picture: AFP / Don Emmert Source: AFP \nThe publicity has meant more and more women are taking part in the practice. \nDe Blasio said on Tuesday that he believes the practice is “wrong” and that a change can be expected “quite soon”. He failed to specify what action he would take to stop it but stated that accepting money for posing topless amounts to “a business transaction”. \n“If there’s a business transaction going on — let’s face it, the women in Times Square, or the furry creatures in Times Square are engaged in a business. We believe that opens the door for us to enforce the way we would with any other business. And we will do so while still respecting Constitutional rights,” de Blasio told the New York Observer . \n“I’m not going to tolerate it, we’re going to change things.” A man takes a selfie as the mayor sees the desnudas in Times Square as pushy panhandlers whose efforts to separate tourists from their money should be regulated. Picture: AFP / Don Emmert Source: AFP \nDe Blasio did admit that the nude women had rights. \n“Our current laws do make it harder to enforce in the way we might like to. There is a First Amendment protection for begging,” De Blasio said. “There is a First Amendment protection for painting yourself and displaying yourself in a certain fashion. It makes no sense, but I understand that is a First Amendment protection.” \nPeña, from Venezuela, said de Blasio’s threats are unnecessary and added the solution is simple. \n“Don’t let their children take photos with us,” she said “We aren’t looking for them, they find us.” If it’s OK for the Naked Cowboy, Robert Burck, to pose for pictures in Times Square why not the body-painted naked women?
