A record- breaking 4,842 travel professionals from 90 countries are congregating this week at the Bellagio Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, where they will conduct a staggering number of one-to-one meetings – over 450,000 of them to be exact – with the end goal of building relationships that lead to better traveler experiences.\nDuring the event’s Opening Session, Virtuoso Chairman and CEO Matthew D. Upchurch took the opportunity to welcome the network’s newest members, announcing that expansion into Europe, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Singapore now brings its membership count to 373 travel agencies with 698 offices throughout 30 countries, accounting for a total of 9,850 travel advisors. Upchurch went on to speak about the unprecedented scenario that is helping propel the luxury travel industry and sales for its travel agency members: four generations of travel advisors serving four generations of travellers.\nDrawing upon the message shared by the event’s keynote speaker, “To Sell is Human” author Daniel Pink, Upchurch spoke about the power of its network to its clientele, “True sales is no longer about being the custodian of information. It’s about helping clients find clarity amongst the flood of information online.”\nCommenting on why travel advisors are so well positioned for success in the future, Upchurch continued by saying, “You can’t take the human out of humanity. As technology continues to spread into every facet of life, there is a desire– even a craving – for real human connection.”\nUpchurch also welcomed special guest Salvatore Ferragamo, CEO of Il Borro in Tuscany, Italy, who delighted the audience with his passion for hospitality, fine wine and delivering authentic experiences for his guests.\nSource:-Virtuoso", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:08:36.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
