What inspired your move, and how long have you been there? I had been living in London, working in the corporate world. I had left that world feeling unfulfilled by my work and decided to travel Asia for six months. I ended up in Yangshuo, China, landed myself a job working in outdoor adventure and settled down here. What do you do there? I am owner-operator of an outdoor adventure business. We take mostly groups of youth and show them the great outdoors and the beauty of China. \nWhat are the greatest advantages to living there? Disadvantages? The amazing landscapes and environments I get to see. Every day is an adventure. Also I'm witnessing the rapid development of an entire country and society. Things are pretty cheap and people are mostly fairly humble. There's a great deal of freedom in certain areas. As for disadvantages, I feel there's a lack of compassion and empathy for people beyond the scope of familiarity. Products and services can be of low quality and hygiene and sanitation can be an issue. Supplied \nYangshuo boasts stunning natural landscapes. \nHow expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is a beer? Cheap a – 600ml bottle of beer is 4 yuan(NZ$1), a bowl of noodles is 3.5 yuan, dinner at a restaurant is 25 yuan and a whole uncooked chicken is 35 yuan. \nWhat do you do in your spare time? I like to do any outdoor activity – rock climbing, caving, kayaking, biking. I also like spending time with my family. \nWhat's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? Guilin noodles, which I would recommend – a rice noodle dish that's a staple of the locals and great for a light meal or snack. Another local delicacy is beer fish – a bottom-feeding cat fish that tastes like mud. I wouldn't recommend that one, it's revolting compared to New Zealand fish. Reuters \nThe Impressions Liu San Jie light show is a must-visit attraction. \nEasiest way to get around? Walking, biking and scootering. \nWhat's the shopping like? There are no supermarkets, instead produce is bought in wet markets. It's great to support locally grown produce, but hold your nose! Sometimes bartering is required and there's a limited supply of things available. \nBest after-dark activity? Impressions Liu San Jie, an open-air musical light show staged on a river. Or having a beer at a rooftop bar Tell us your Expat Tale Share your stories, photos and videos. \nBest time of year to visit? Mid to late October and November Ad Feedback \nWhat are the top three things you recommend for visitors? Visit Moon Hill (a hill with a natural arch through it), bike around the countryside and go to the Impressions Liu San Jie light show. \nBesides family and friends, what do you miss most about home? Kiwi food, Kiwi thinking and being able to buy anything I want on a whim. \nHow easy is it for you to get back to NZ? It's about a 12-hour flight. \nFor Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent? Anything from English teaching to the corporate world. \nIf you know an expat who wants to share inside knowledge of their home away from home, hit the green 'contribute' button above or email escape@star-times.co.nz with Expat in the subject line. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T00:02:07.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
