MARIO ANZUONI / Reuters, file Sandy Stelling, managing director of customer research and development for Alaska Airlines, found Neffenger's interest in biometrics encouraging.\n\"We're thrilled to learn that the TSA administrator has biometric technology on his radar,\" Stelling said. \"Many of our frequent fliers are interested in technology that makes the travel experience easier.\"\nWhile biometrics might make some parts of the airport experience smoother, it is not yet a foolproof way to identify passengers.\n\"You need a known database - with hundreds of millions of passengers in it - from which to compare. That's a huge IT issue,\" said Jeff Price, professor of aviation management, Metropolitan State University, Denver.\nadvertisement But even if not perfect, using biometrics to ID a passenger might not pose a serious security risk.\n\"If you go through screening, but you aren't the right person, that's a minor security sin,\" said Price. \"As long as you don't have a prohibited item, and you've been screened, then you're not really a major threat.\"\nGot a news tip?
