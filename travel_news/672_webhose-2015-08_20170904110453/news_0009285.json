From migrating whales seen off the coast of New South Wales to curious kangaroos who like to join picnickers on the beach, amazing creatures come with the territory in this varied island nation. And there are plenty of ways to combine a brush with wildlife with a gourmet meal and the perfect glass of wine, creating a truly unique holiday experience and some great travel snaps. For dinner, with a side of nature, try these amazing experiences… Snap up a meal with a crocodile Mention crocodiles and lunch, and you may worry that you that will be on the menu. Not so at the late Steve Irwin’s Australia Zoo, at Beerwah on the Sunshine Coast. Sign up for a special day-long adventure and the Feeding Frenzy food court will keep the wolf from the door while you thrill to the jaw-dropping action in the Crocoseum. It’s as close as you can safely get to these prehistoric monsters without being snapped up as a snack. Picturesque ponds and platypus sightings In the Blue Mountains, the spectacular Jenolan Caves are a must-see. The oldest caves in the world, they boast cathedral-like rock formations, underground rivers and crystal formations. After a day exploring, tuck into an evening meal amid the Victorian opulence of Chisolm’s restaurant, then stroll down to the aptly named Blue Pond for a glimpse of the often publicity-shy platypus. You’re virtually guaranteed to see the bizarre egg-laying mammals mooching about to find some tucker of their own. Perch among the trees with the possums If you get the feeling you are being watched while dining at the Gunyah restaurant, it is probably because you are. Set on a platform, among the trees, this eatery belongs to the luxurious Paperbark Camp in New South Wales. Perched high to make the most of a sea breeze and great views, you’ll see birds among the branches and, if you’re lucky, the beady eyes of a curious possum as it runs along the railings of the veranda. Luxury camping: a wilderness safari in the Gawler Ranges Fine wine and whale watching While in NSW you can watch for whales as you dive into the menu of super-fresh seafood at Jonah’s restaurant on Whale Beach in Sydney. The contemporary Australian cuisine is perfectly paired with a cellar containing more than 6,000 bottles of vintage Australian and international wine. The restaurant’s glorious deck overlooks the Pacific Ocean and provides a peerless vantage point to see minke and humpback breach and frolic during their spring and autumn migrations. Golf clubs and kangaroos Set on the beautiful Coffs Coast, between Sydney and Brisbane, is a golf course with a twist. Known as one of the most beautiful in Australia, Bonville Golf Resort also boasts one of the best restaurants to be found in a clubhouse. At the award-winning Flooded Gums eatery, Wagyu beef, saltwater barramundi and slow-roast lamb shoulder grace an impressively diverse menu. As if that were not enough, the course and surrounding area are a natural sanctuary for native species. As you play on the manicured fairways, you could spot anything from swamp wallabies, kangaroos and black cockatoos to parakeets, water dragons and goannas, making it a truly unforgettable experience. Breakfast with cuddly koalas No trip Down Under is complete without cuddling a koala, and at Wild Life Hamilton Island – off Queensland’s coast – visitors can do just that. While the drowsy marsupials chew their gum leaves, a lavish breakfast buffet provides animal-loving humans with the fuel for a thrilling day among the indigenous species. And after you’ve snapped that must-have koala picture, keep your camera handy so you can say “cheese” with dingoes, wombats, snakes and more. Safaris and star-lit dinners Luxury tents are your home from home on a wilderness safari in the Gawler Ranges – at the northern end of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. Immerse yourself in the harsh beauty of the outback, where you will explore the ever-changing landscape by day and tuck into bush dinners beneath the stars at night. As you dine out, you’ll be in the company of kangaroos, emus and wombats. For a taste of the real Australia, it’s unbeatable.
