Introducing Haute Montagne’s Bella Coola, Verbier Proudly positioned in heart of Verbier between two main lift stations, Haute Montagne’s Bella Coola is a magnificent five-bedroom private residence with spacious gardens. Bella Coola is set to impress with a fabulous indoor swimming pool, colonial style pool bar and a private outdoor hot tub with picturesque views of the mountains. At the hub of the chalet an astounding private spa and wellness area, with Turkish hammam, offers one of the most luxurious in-chalet spa experiences in Verbier. Set over four floors and sleeping up to 11 people in five, individually designed, en-suite bedrooms, there is endless space for guests to relax and socialise. As with all Haute Montagne chalets, Bella Coola will have impeccable service from a highly skilled team: whether guests require ski and boot fittings and hire at the chalet, private in-chalet yoga and Pilates classes, six-course tasting menus each night, professional childcare, transfers by helicopter, heli-skiing, heli-sightseeing or private ski guiding, Haute Montagne is able to facilitate their guest’s every need. A highly qualified professional chef will prepare breakfast, after-ski snacks, and dinner. The chefs work with each group individually to create the perfect menu for their stay, be it a seven course evening meal or something simple and healthy, with a wine list provided by a renowned Verbier cave. Guests also enjoy a dedicated chauffeur and vehicle (Volkswagen Caravelle or similar) operating between the hours of 8.30am until 2am, as well as in door car parking. A chalet manager and hosts will be constantly on hand to pour morning coffee, serve dinner in the evenings and provide guests with a concierge service for booking restaurants, activities and more. For the ultimate week away Bella Coola can be taken with Haute Montagne’s sister company, Bramble Ski’s, new Le Ti chalet, to create the Bella Coola Estate sleeping 20 people; the perfect option for large groups of friends or families.
