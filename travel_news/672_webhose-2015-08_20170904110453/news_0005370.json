It recommends that the Department of Transportation, which has the power to investigate and prohibit \"unfair or deceptive\" practices in the airline industry, investigate whether bag fees should be tied to actual costs incurred by an airline.\nThe report also says that in most cases airlines charge fees for changing or cancelling a ticket no matter how far in advance of a flight the changes are made. And it criticized airline websites that mislead consumers into believing they have to pay an extra fee to obtain a seat.\nJean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, an airline industry trade association, rejected the report's criticisms.\n\"It would be difficult to find an industry that is more transparent than airlines in their pricing,\" she said in an email. \"The fact that a record number of people are travelling this summer further demonstrates that customers always know what they are buying before they purchase.\"\n___\nFollow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:16:04.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
