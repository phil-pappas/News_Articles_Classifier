Chris McGonigal Photo Editor, The Huffington Post Alexandra Ma Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/06/2015 02:45 PM EDT \nThe WorldPost's \" Through Your Lens \" series brings you mesmerizing photos taken by social media users in different countries around the world every week. \nRainbows have long evoked a sense of mystery and wonder in popular culture. An Irish legend holds that the rainbow's end is where leprechauns hide their pot of gold. In Armenian mythology, it is considered the belt of the god Tir. The rainbow has also been the symbol of hope and social change -- both the LGBT movement and post-apartheid democratic South Africa use rainbow flags. \nAnd, after seeing these gorgeous photos, we can see why. From Switzerland to Myanmar to Costa Rica, anyone and everyone can enjoy nature's gift of color, no matter what climate or hemisphere they may be in.
