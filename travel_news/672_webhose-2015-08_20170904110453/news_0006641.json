Scores of homes remain threatened, and mandatory evacuation orders remained in effect for more than 2,900 people in the area.\n\nTimber burns in the First Creek fire near lakeside structures on the western shore of Lake Chelan late Monday, Aug. 17, 2015, near Chelan, Wash. Big wildfires threatened the Lake Chelan resort region of central Washington on Monday after driving away tourists, destroying a warehouse filled with nearly 2 million pounds of apples and forcing thousands of residents to flee. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) \nMike Steele, director of the Lake Chelan Chamber of Commerce, said it's too early to determine the economic impact of the lost tourist dollars, but he said it would be \"significant.\"\n\"We're working hard to get our feet back on the ground,\" Steele said, noting that many of the people who would serve tourists have either had to leave or lost homes.\nThe Chelan fires were just some of the many destructive blazes burning throughout the Northwest. In northern Idaho, more than 40 homes were lost near the town of Kamiah, and in Oregon a lightning-sparked blaze on the Malheur National Forest has grown to more than 60 square miles and has destroyed at least 26 homes.\nSo many fires are burning across the West that the National Interagency Fire Center announced Monday that 200 active-duty military troops were being called in to help. They will be sent to a fire on Sunday.\nCrews reduced the threat to homes from a wildfire on California's Central Coast, even as the blaze exploded in size to more than 3 square miles early Tuesday, officials said. The wildfire burning north of San Luis Obispo was one of the few blazes in the state growing despite a cooling trend.\nThe blazes near Chelan, about 180 miles east of Seattle, are burning through grass, brush and timber, fire spokeswoman Janet Pearce said. The uncontained fires were being battled by more than 900 firefighters, she said.\nAir tankers established lines to keep the flames from reaching downtown Chelan, fire officials said.\nThe fires also threaten apple orchards and packing warehouses in the heart of the state's apple belt during what has been a summer of drought in the Northwest.\nChelan Fruit lost one of its major fruit-packing warehouses in Chelan to wildfire on Friday. The warehouse contained 1.8 million pounds of apples and employed about 800 people, said Mac Riggan, director of marketing for the company.\nThe employees are being sent to Chelan Fruit's other facilities in the region, Riggan said. \"Our other plant in Chelan is fully operational,\" he said.\nWashington is by far the nation's largest apple producer, and the industry produced more than 140 million cartons of apples last year, of which perhaps 6 million remain in warehouses, Riggan said.\n\"It's not a major loss to the industry,\" Riggan said. \"It is to us.\"\nWashington farmers grossed about $2 billion from the apple crop last year, and late-season apples tend to sell at a discount as buyers are waiting for new fruit, he said.\nThe air was clouded with smoke in Spokane, about 150 miles east of the Chelan fire, on Monday. Air quality was expected to remain in the \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" range for at least the next couple of days because of the Chelan fire and other fires, according to the Spokane Regional Health District, which serves the metropolitan area of nearly 500,000 people.\n\"Smoke from wildfires is especially harmful for those with health conditions like asthma. We recommend that people who are sensitive to poor air quality limit their time outdoors,\" said Dr. Joel McCullough, the local health officer.\nMeanwhile, the Washington National Guard joined the firefighting efforts in the state. Two Black Hawk helicopters arrived Friday and five 20-person hand crews arrived Sunday evening to join 350 firefighters battling one of the state's most active fires, Cougar Creek, on the southeastern slopes of Mount Adams.\n\"We've been expecting another devastating wildfire season, and have had our personnel and equipment ready so we can get them out the door the moment we're asked for help,\" said Maj. Gen. Bret Daugherty, commander of the Washington National Guard.\nIn northern Idaho on Monday more than 700 firefighters along with 40 fire engines and four helicopters were trying to protect homes from flames but residents along an 11-mile section of U.S. Highway 12 were told to be ready to flee.\nOn the Idaho-Oregon border some 800 firefighters had a 443-square-mile wildfire 90 per cent contained. However, fire officials warned that strong winds and low humidity, which can cause extreme fire activity, could make the situation worse.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:58:41.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
