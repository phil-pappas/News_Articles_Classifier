The world class Darwin Convention Centre, set on Larrakia land that has been used as a gathering place since ancient times, is a fitting home for this significant Indigenous art event which attracts thousands of visitors from across Australia and overseas. \nThe Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair is the only event of its kind bringing together Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists, art ambassadors and Art Centres from remote, regional and metro areas of Australia. It presents an incredible opportunity for visitors to Darwin to learn, interact and purchase art directly from the Indigenous-owned and operated Art Centres. This year, more than fifty Indigenous-owned and operated Art Centres will exhibit at the Fair. Together, they represent the works of over 2,000 emerging and established Indigenous artists, which include paintings on canvas, paper and bark, sculpture, didgeridoos, fibre art and cultural regalia. With artworks priced from $5 through to $15,000, the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair is one of Australia’s most inclusive and accessible art events. Artistic demonstrations and workshops will run daily at 10am to 1pm and 1pm to 4pm, including ghost net weaving, bark painting, screen printing and boab nut engraving. Visitors will also be treated to cultural performances by the Binji Garrigadt, Gakbi, Goyek, Warlem Dancers from the outer Darwin Region and the Waringarri Dancers from the East Kimberly region, at 12.30pm daily. The program also includes guest speakers, live radio broadcasts and a photography exhibition. “The Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair is one of our favourite events on our annual calendar. With most of the artists residing in remote locations, the Centre is the ideal setting to showcase the vibrancy and diversity of creative expression in Indigenous art under one roof,” says Janet Hamilton, General Manager of the Darwin Convention Centre. “The genuine up-close and personal approach of the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair also makes it a unique cultural event and a major draw-card for international and Australian art collectors and visitors to come and enjoy beautiful Darwin at this time of year. Over the past 9 years, the Fair has developed a reputation as an internationally recognised arts event, and we are thrilled to be the part of that growth and put Darwin on the international map,” says Ms Hamilton.
