Here are our picks for the best “secret” places in China.\n1. Suzhou: China’s city of canals\nIs Suzhou the Venice of China, or is Venice the Suzhou of Italy? Enchanting canals, arched foot bridges, and the mesmerising effects of threading waterways through cityscapes make both canal cities unforgettable. Water isn’t the only draw though; the historic city is also known for its more than 50 classical gardens, including nine recognised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).\nNo, this isn’t Venice.

For more than 600 years, Foshan has been a hub for folk art, bringing the stories of its people to life through painting, ceramics, paper arts, and calligraphy. Art appreciation gets hands-on at the Nan Fendg Ancient Kiln, where visitors can make their own pottery in the traditional style.\n3. Shangli: A step back in time\nAncient travellers may have found their way to Shangli along the Silk Road, but it remains an off-the-beaten-path gem for modern tourists from foreign lands. Fall into a slower pace of life and explore the town’s famed eight stone bridges and historic architecture.\nStill true to its trading-route roots, Shangli remains dotted with small shops selling local artisanal wares.\nSpectacular Shangli.

Known as the “City of Flowers”, elaborate gardens define this ancient city in the Pearl River Delta. Explore history and beauty at the Yu Yin Shan Fang Qing dynasty garden and the Canton and Lingnan style Bao Mo Garden.\nTime your visit right and you can also see the kitschy Guangzhou Panyu Sunflower Garden, touted as the largest sunflower park in the world.\n5. Xi’an: The birthplace of Chinese civilisation\nWith its more than 7000 years of history, Xi’an is recognised as the birthplace of Chinese civilisation. Home to the famous Terracotta Warriors, the ancient imperial capital is also the eastern departure point of the historic Silk Road trade route. Yet many tourists overlook this place.\nThe Terracotta Warriors of Xi’an. Source: Supplied\n6. Kaiping: China’s historic melting pot\nIn the early 20th century, the city of Kaiping — less than three hours by car from Guangzhou — was a popular destination for European and Southeast Asian immigrants. The international influence is visible today in the architecture and food.\nKaiping, China. Source: Getty Images\n7. Meijiawu: Tea culture\nIn China, tea matters. And in Meijiawu, life revolves around tea. The surrounding countryside is lush with Longjing tea plantations, and the village itself steeped in the traditions of tea production and consumption.\nLearn about the history and production of the famed Dragon Well Tea, and then explore some of the more than 160 tea houses to experience tea ceremonies and sample some of the local tea food.\n8. Hangzhou: Heaven on Earth\nHangzhou delivers the blueprint for paradise. The city is best known for the West Lake (Xi Hu), a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to garden designs likened to heaven right here on Earth.\nIn the vast surrounding capital city, find famous temples and pagodas as well as the National Tea Museum and the National Silk Museum.\nYes, stunning.
