The agency were delighted to present Ella Crowther with her prize following her recent graduation ceremony. Established in 1996, the UK Centre For Events Management at Leeds Beckett University is the leading provider of events education in the country. In April 2014 the university appointed SPARK THINKING to deliver the production requirements for their graduation ceremonies. \nLuke Flett (Global Marketing Manager, SPARK THINKING) said: “As an agency we think it is important to reward and recognise the bright sparks of tomorrow. University graduates are the next generation of thinkers, leaders and doers and will face a complex and challenging future. We are keen to encourage any initiatives that supports talented and enthusiastic individuals and allows them to showcase the new types of value and fresh thinking they can bring to our industry. We are confident that Ella has a glowing career ahead of her. As part of her four year degree she undertook a placement year with the specialist events venue, 8 Northumberland Avenue, so she is already well versed with the intricacies of our sector.” Ella commented: \"During my first induction lecture at the university I remember the lecturers sharing an image of the highest academic achiever at that year's graduation ceremony. I remember thinking to myself what an accolade it would be to receive the award but never dreamed it would be me. I am so very grateful for all of the help I have received throughout the duration of my degree from lecturers, friends and family. I would also like to express my gratitude to SPARK THINKING for sponsoring the ‘Student Of The Year’ award. It is exciting to launch my career with all of this experience and support behind me\". Luke Flett, who is a member of the EVCOM Professional Development Committee, added: “We will continue to develop strong working relationships with academic institutions offering event management courses as education, training and continued professional development is very important to our organisation. Anything that encourages and facilitates collaboration between industry practitioners, lecturers and the student community can only enhance the effectiveness of our industry.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T12:32:42.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
