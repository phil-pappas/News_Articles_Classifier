The new version of be-on-road is the first navigation app in the world powered by OpenStreetMaps to provide realistic 3D maps in a native Android interface. The app is available on Google Play absolutely free of charge.\nStarting today, users of be-on-road navigation can enjoy full-featured navigation based on OpenStreetMaps with beautiful design with realistic 3D maps and new premium features.\nThe new version of the app offers DashCam , which is becoming one of the most important car accessories. Road rage, the overtaking of trucks and wild animal crossings are but a few of the unexpected issues that can cause a disastrous crash on the road. Dash cam technology is one of the most dependable aids in pinpointing the perpetrators of vehicular accidents and the most reliable in providing evidence.\nUsing DashCam is straightforward: drivers can activate the feature with a single touch from the app's menu, place their smartphone on a car mount and start driving. The application will automatically begin recording a continuous loop with embedded GPS coordinates, current speed, time and date.\nAnother new premium feature of be-on-road, called TravelBook, allows users to keep track of their drives by logging journey time, duration, distance, speed, and accumulated height statistics.\nUnlike other map services, map data for be-on-road navigation is stored on the user's phone instead of streamed from the Internet. Users of be-on-road don't need to worry about getting lost in areas with poor reception or running up against their cellular data caps while using GPS navigation.\nNew features in be-on-road:\nNew High Quality Voices Including TTS Sharp Curve Warnings with Recommended Speed Railway Crossings Alerts Upcoming Speed Limits Alternate Routes 3D maps New Search Bar Native Android Interface New premium features (no additional costs for premium users):\nDashCam TravelBook Photo Navigation Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFzlppQygeo&feature=youtu.be\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150828/261877\n releases/groundbreaking-update-of-be-on-road-app-to-change-standards-of-navigation-apps-powered-by-openstreetmaps-300134640.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN88973&Transmission_Id=201508310900PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN88973&DateId=20150831", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFzlppQygeo?version=3", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFzlppQygeo", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150828/261877", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150828/261877", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/groundbreaking-update-of-be-on-road-app-to-change-standards-of-navigation-apps-powered-by-openstreetmaps-300134640.html"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:37:33.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
