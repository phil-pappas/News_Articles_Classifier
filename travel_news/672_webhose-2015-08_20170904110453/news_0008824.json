Both cities are located in Fujian Province, which has a population of almost 38 million.\nSydney Airport Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Kerrie Mather said the new XiamenAir relationship demonstrates the expanded China-Australia bilateral agreement is delivering significant benefits already.\n“This is expected to further grow the important Chinese passenger market, which is expected to be Australia’s largest inbound visitor market next year,” Ms Mather said.\nBoth routes will operate with new 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft and are subject to Federal Government approval.\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:41:55.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
