In the first half of the year, 1.65 million guests came to Cologne (up by 6 percent) for 2.88 million overnight stays (up by 8.2 percent). At 9.4 percent, the increase in the overnight stays in Cologne by visitors from abroad is particularly impressive. Partly due to the very good result in June, the figure for Cologne is substantially above the German average of 5 percent. No other well-known big city in Germany recorded such dynamic growth in the number of overnight stays. \nAccording to the feedback received from the hotel sector, the occupancy rate rose to over 70 percent in the first half of 2015. The RevPar (revenue per available room) is expected to increase at a high double-digit rate. \n“The balanced mix of events brings many guests to Cologne and ensures that the hotels are well occupied”, says Stephanie Kleine Klausing, Director of Conventions & Marketing at KölnTourismus GmbH. “Along with the various attractions that draw people to Cologne the whole year through, many visitors came to the city in the first half of the year because of strong trade fairs, major conventions and attractive events, such as exclusive Germany shows and international sport events in the LANXESS arena.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:17:18.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
