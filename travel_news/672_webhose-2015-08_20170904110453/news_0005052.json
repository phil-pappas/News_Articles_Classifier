We’ve all seen those award-winning photos of monks negotiating swaying rope bridges strung over an abyss. You may not make it to a Far Eastern monastery, but the thrill of balancing on ropes strung through the tree tops can be enjoyed a lot closer to home. Whether as a team-building exercise or a way to test your mettle (and have your kids laugh at you), here’s why you should try rope walking: 1. It's great for balance Rope adventure venues aren’t looking for casualties - it’s bad for PR - so you’ll be strapped into a harness and hard hat before you’re set free on the rope bridges. Knowing you’re safe means you can focus simply on balancing technique, which is excellent for core strength. Plus it’s fun to test yourself on a swaying rope walk, high in the tree tops. 2. It's exciting Whether you’re high in the trees, plummeting down a zip wire or balancing along ropes suspended 60 feet up, you’ll be buzzing with adrenalin. It feels much like the first time you climbed a tree as a kid and surveyed the land from the top, dizzy with triumph. But this time you don’t have to worry about your mum going mad with you later. 3. It's aerobic Holding onto ropes, using your strength to push yourself forward and haul yourself along, is bound to get you breathless. Rope walking speeds up your heart rate, gets the blood pumping and adds a hint of childish excitement to exercise. 4. It's good for team bonding At Tree Top Adventure Snowdonia they take team bonding seriously. A rope course is used to study how the team interacts and supports each other. Then afterwards, the team dynamic is analysed and discussed. If you’d prefer to do it with mates, a few hours swinging through the trees together and helping each other through the various challenges will mean you’ll enjoy the later drinking session all the more. No analysis required. 5. It's family time At outdoor adventure company Go Ape , the two to three-hour Tree Top adventure is ideal for families who want a more exciting trip out than a wander round Ikea and a row about cupboard handles on the way home. There are 28 Go Ape venues around Britain, and over-10s can take to the treetops with their parents (fully harnessed and hard-hatted) to test their balance and bravery.
