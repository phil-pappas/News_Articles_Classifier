Another $13.7 million was spent within 10 miles of eight of the regional parks that were the focus of a study prepared by Arizona State University . The county Parks and Recreation Department manages 10 regional parks across the Valley and is responsible for the development of the Maricopa Trail, 350 miles of hiking, equestrian and cycling trails that will encircle the county. It also operates the 26,000-square-foot Desert Outdoor Center at Lake Pleasant. Parks and outdoor activities are considered economic development selling points, particularly for businesses targeting young families and workers in the millennial class who desire such lifestyle opportunities when considering relocation. Although workforce quality is paramount, companies recognize there will be outside recruiting once a facility opens in a new location, said site selection consultant Angelos Angelo , CEO of Austin-based Angelo Economics. The quality of life characteristics of a region are important in luring talent. Gregg Wassmandorf , senior managing director for Newmark Grubb Knight Frank Global Corporate Services in Toronto and a site selection consultant, said quality of life is something that will keep a market on a company’s short list, or drop it from consideration. Maricopa Parks and Recreation Department says it generated a 42 percent return on taxpayer’s investment in the regional park system. The organization has an operating budget of $9.7 million. “Although the positive benefits these open spaces provide to us are profound, many are intangible and difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. However, in working to inform policy and planning, numbers matter,” said Stacie Beute with Central Arizona Conservation Alliance.
