And there was the possibility that its Calais Seaways vessel may have to be diverted to Dunkirk due to the blockade.\nThe mayor of Calais , Natacha Bouchart, said she regretted that the port was being taken “hostage” as travellers were urged to contact their operator before beginning their journeys.\nA Port of Dover spokesman said: “We will continue to monitor the situation closely in liaison with our ferry partners and the port of Calais in order to resume normal operations as soon as possible.”\nP&O Ferries said the Calais port was closed due to action by former MyFerryLink staff. The blockade happened during a busy bank holiday weekend for ferry operators. Former employees at MyFerryLink have orchestrated wildcat strikes before this summer, causing delays and cancellations for holidaymakers.\nTo add to the difficulties, Eurotunnel said it was only accepting passengers with pre-booked tickets from Calais on Sunday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T01:05:08.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
