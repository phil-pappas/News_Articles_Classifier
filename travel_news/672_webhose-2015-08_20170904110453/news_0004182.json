Having recently returned from a visit to Bucklebury Farm Park near Reading, I think not. My 19-month-old granddaughter was entranced by the animals, to pet, stroke, watch and wonder at, as were children much older than her. The play areas were well used, as was the reasonably priced café/restaurant. As an alternative there were plenty of picnic areas. And for us “older kids”, I will never forget the sight of the fully antlered stags charging at the tractor and trailer only to pull up yards away, ready to be fed by us. It was a real family experience.

In my global business travels in the Eighties and Nineties, I often wished I’d had a camera other than a bulky and easily stealable SLR. Among others things, I would have captured the purple corn fungus omelette in Mexico City, the baby live elvers in Barcelona, the barbecued sheep’s eyeball in Bishkek, the frog backfat in Chongqing, and slugs in the strawberries in Zurich. Peter Scott Two women taking a picture at a cafe Photo: Fotolia/AP Nagasaki memories I visited Nagasaki in 1997 and loved the atmosphere of the city (“ A new dawn for Nagasaki ”). The A-bomb museum was also a lot more balanced and thoughtful than Hiroshima’s, putting the events of the war (on both sides) into context and not just concentrating on what happened in 1945. Comment online Hell of a hike Reading about Kris and Doug Tompkins (“ The new face of Patagonia\") reminded me of a visit to the Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. It was the first time I’d done any serious walking, though my companion, who had planned the trek, was a seasoned schlepper. The first leg was fine – the two-hour walk to an overnight refugio, with fantastic views, seemed a doddle. Next day, our “five-hour” hike took closer to nine hours. We’d long stopped admiring the scenery and wildlife, as we contemplated the prospect of missing the last ferry. Heads down, we ploughed on through the fading light to the gleaming beacon of the Lake Pehoe restaurant and ferry stop with 20 minutes to spare. I’ve never been so happy to see a boat in my life.

Venice is wonderful but you’ll get more for your euros, more privacy and the personal touch if you stay off the main tourist track. My son married in Italy; he may not have Clooney’s looks and certainly not his money, but his wedding was the most romantic, joyful event. He and his partner married in Orta San Giulio on the edge of picturesque Lake Orta, an hour’s drive north of Milan. A wedding couple in Venice Photo: Fotolia/AP In good weather you can say “I do” in the colourful garden of Villa Bossi, the register office on the lakeside. After the ceremony, hop on a boat around the magical island of San Giulio as you sip champagne. Sail to the lakeside Hotel Giardinetto at Pettenasco for your celebratory meal. The food is excellent and the terrace overlooking the lake is perfect for alfresco dining. Make it special – stay the night in one of their idyllic rooms with lake and island view. I promise you’ll return for your anniversary. Shelley White • Romantic Venice: what to do and where to stay Visa surprise I was astounded to discover the challenge and cost of getting a visa for a city break to St Petersburg. The agent had not warned us that this was necessary. I was advised to use a specialist agent to complete the forms, but this would have cost over £100… so I did it myself, despite having to redo it online at the visa centre (another £5 for computer use) because of a mistake. It still cost £88.40 – more than my return flight. Had I and my companion known about this, we would never have considered St Petersburg for such a short break. Anyone thinking of going there needs to be aware of the visa issue before they book.
