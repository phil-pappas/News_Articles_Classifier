A phrase originally coined to define the group of people born between the end of the Second World War and the 1960s has become a “term of abuse” according to the study by an alliance of charities and think-tanks with an interest in the impact of Britain’s ageing society. The report, compiled by the Ready for Ageing Alliance, rejects the idea that there is a lucky generation preparing to take life easy amid unprecedented levels of health and wealth at the expense of those coming afterwards. Money is tight for many Photo: Alamy It draws together data on health, property, pensions and education to challenge the caricatures surrounding a generation routinely assumed to have profited from rising property values, free university education and final salary pension schemes. It argues that far from being a lucky generation, many baby boomers are still enduring the effects of soaring interest rates in previous decades and wide inequalities in health and pension provision while shouldering some of the biggest caring responsibilities in society. • Stop blaming baby boomers for everything • Baby boomers are not the lucky generation in the pay stakes • Rock 'n roll care homes for baby boomers David Sinclair, director of the International Longevity Centre UK think-tank, and one of the authors of the report, said: “The term baby boomer seems to be increasingly used to inflame divisions and resentment between younger and older generations. “The report highlights that whilst some boomers are ageing successfully, there is huge diversity in income, wealth and experiences of those aged 55 to 70. “Our ageing society will impact on both young and older people. Today’s younger people are tomorrows older. “If we are to ensure our increasingly ageing society is prosperous for all future generations, we must find ways of bring older and younger together rather than pitch them against each other.” The report concludes that baby boomers as a group have little in common other than their age. While the generation is experiencing major improvements in life expectancy, the report points out that the difference between the number of years people can expect to spend in “good health” varies by almost 20 years in different parts of the country. It adds that while university education was free in the past, less than a fifth of people aged between 55 and 64 have a degree, a proportion which declines to just 13 per cent among those in their late 60s.

It adds that 28 per cent of people aged between 55 and 64 in mainland Britain have no private pension wealth at all – a proportion which rises to 37 per cent among women. The report notes, wryly, that people over 50 even play less golf than other generations. “The term ‘baby boomer’ is increasingly used as a term of abuse,” it concludes. “The picture often painted is one of a group who are ageing well. They are wealthy demanding consumers who are demanding Government resources and stealing from the young. “But painting this picture has the potential to result in worse outcomes for both young and old. “If we are to ensure that future generations experience ageing better, policy makers cannot use the myth of the baby boomer as an excuse for inaction. “It is in the interests of both younger and older people that we find a way of ensuring more older people today and tomorrow retire well.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T23:13:31.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
