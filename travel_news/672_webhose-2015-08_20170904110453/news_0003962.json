Watch vistas that change with the regularity of a heartbeat and enjoy stellar service with Princess Cruises as they showcase the world from the ocean. \nWith 50 years' experience, Princess Cruises create journeys that encompass adventure as well as expertise – the opportunity to discover new places but with the guidance of a dedicated crew. \nItineraries are well-planned but never predictable, organised yet flexible and excursions can be as active or as idle as you like. Enjoy meticulously detailed programmes and panoramas that change every time your captain culls the engine. \nOn-board there exists a level of luxury that never waivers. With attentive service, accommodation to suit every requirement and daily entertainment – whether that's off-shore or on – the amenities are as endless as the sea on which you sail. \nWith Singapore named the leading homeport in Asia, begin your cruise in a city that accommodates some of the world's largest mega ships and an award-winning seaport to boot. Clean, modern and always immaculately turned out, Singapore is a handsome metropolis defined by its glistening skyline and an affluence derived from centuries of industry. Fusing the east and west, cultural attractions are abundant – from British influenced architecture and contemporary cuisine, to the extensive shops of Orchard Rd and the infamous Singapore Sling. \nWith an atmosphere as intoxicating as its cocktails, this is a city that's fervent and frenzied, boasting a dazzling urban landscape and a base that provides the perfect appetiser before embarking on a journey to China, Vietnam, Hong Kong and – if your sea-legs are worthy – as far flung as Australia. \nFrom the wide open sea that radiates by day, to star-filled evenings punctured by the sound of a jazz band, or piano players and comedy-induced laughter – depending on the night's entertainment – no two days are the same. \nBy morning you'll be docked in Shanghai, 24-hours later you could be in Hong Kong. Every day is unique – a surprise awaiting your discovery. \nExplore dynasties in Beijing and bustling streets in Bangkok, find a vitality that only exists in Vietnam and a standard of beauty so breath-taking, it's simply known as Balinese. For every day you dock, there's a different culture to be admired, another custom to be learned. Ad Feedback \nTake a trip with Princess Cruises and you'll enjoy an experience much richer than your average holiday. You'll discover multiple destinations and cities that astound, history that shaped the very world you seek and new friends to share it with. All during one remarkable journey. - Sponsored content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:34:54.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
