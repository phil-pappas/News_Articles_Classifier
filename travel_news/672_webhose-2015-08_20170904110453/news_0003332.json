Tucked into the Euganean Hills in the spa town of Galzignano Terme near Padua, Italy, the resort is in one of Europe's most renowned thermal bath regions, 57 kilometres (36 miles) from Venice. Its 30 timeshare units are part of an extensive renovation that created a resort complex with three hotels and a full range of world-class amenities. \n“This upscale resort is one of 18 properties in the JSH Hotel Group, a brand renowned for outstanding hospitality, accommodations, and fine dining,” said Darren Ettridge, Interval’s senior vice president of resort sales and business development for Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia. “One of the more recent developments is the brand's partnership with well-known Italian chef Andrea Ribaldone, who is revolutionizing the cuisine in its gourmet restaurants using locally sourced products. Guests have the best of both worlds — exceptional facilities in beautiful natural surroundings and easy access to one of Europe’s most memorable cities.” \nLavishly furnished rooms are housed in the three hotels: Radisson Blu Majestic, Radisson Blu Sporting, and Hotel Splendid. Each air-conditioned unit has a private balcony or terrace and is equipped with an LCD TV with Sky TV channels and complimentary Wi-Fi. \nThe 35-hectare (86-acre) property is laced with scenic paths and trails for jogging, nature walks, or mountain bike excursions. Guests may use the indoor and outdoor thermal and relaxation areas, which include 37°C (98°F) pools, sauna, hot tub, and Turkish bath, and book professional treatments at Revital Spa. Architect Marco Croze designed the on-site nine-hole golf course, which is dotted with water traps and lakes to challenge both amateur and experienced golfers. The property also has six tennis courts, a fully equipped gym, and several restaurants, including Naiades that specializes in modern interpretations of traditional Mediterranean dishes. \n“We are pleased to be affiliated with Interval International, so that we can offer our owners access to a network of quality resorts matching our own high standards,” said Raniero Amati, managing director of Galzignano Gestioni, the management company for Galzignano Terme Spa & Golf Resort. “Having Interval as a partner gives us the international exposure we need to build our brand in the shared ownership space.” \nAbout Interval International \nInterval International operates membership programs for vacationers and provides value-added services to its developer clients worldwide.
