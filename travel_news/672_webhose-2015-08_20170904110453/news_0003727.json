The little town has good restaurants and shops, and the beach is ripe for strolling, swimming, sunbathing, surfing and hunting for shells and sea glass.\nAnd speaking of sea glass, visitors to this town will want to check out its newest bed-and-breakfast, the SeaGlass Inn.\nBeautifully designed bathrooms helped win this in a 4-diamond rating from AAA. Contributed Melbourne Beach residents Richard and Jeanne Beaudoin opened the inn in 2013 after renovations and additions to a property they had owned for awhile. The home was built in 1915 and was originally a boarding house. Travelers came by ferry to the Melbourne Beach pier, boarded a small rail car, and traveled down Ocean Avenue to the beach.\nThe Beaudoins preserved the traditional island-style setting and added a treehouse cabana with six more guest rooms. The addition was built around a majestic oak tree, which comes right through the roof.\nA courtyard with a heated swimming pool and a fire pit has become a favorite of guests, who make themselves comfortable under the shade of large mango trees.\nRooms are equipped with every amenity to make travelers welcome. Contributed Steve Sharkey, who runs the inn for the Beaudoins, said breakfasts are gourmet feasts with dishes that include fresh roasted potatoes, eggs Benedict with Asiago cheese sauce and homemade scones.\nThe inn is four-tenths of a mile from the beach beside the Indian River Lagoon and across the street from a park with tennis courts. The popular Djonâ€™s Steak & Lobster House is two doors away.\nSince the home is celebrating its 100th birthday this year, guests can take $100 off their next stay of two nights or more if they wish the eight-room inn a happy birthday at the time of booking.\nThe historic SeaGlass Inn was built in 1915 and was originally a boarding house. Contributed The B&B added the Treehouse Cabana, which has six new rooms. This unique addition is built around a majestic oak tree that comes through the roof.
