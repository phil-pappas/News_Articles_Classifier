Unfortunately it is midnight and no one is using it. Next morning, however, homes and workplaces are guzzling juice from the national grid – but the weather is flat calm. It is one of the energy industry’s fundamental conundrums: how to store surplus electrical energy to better match production with demand. A young engineer from Glasgow thinks he has solved it, with an inventive solution that won him the energy category in the STEM Awards 2015. Mark Goudie, 23, has just joined international design, engineering and project management consultancy Atkins after graduating from the University of Strathclyde with an MEng in electrical and mechanical engineering. The solution that so impressed the awards judges uses the infrastructure of a mature industry, offshore oil and gas, to improve the efficiency of a developing one, offshore wind. My system could not only prolong the working life of oil and gas reservoirs but also use spent reservoirs to store surplus wind energy “As offshore production fields age, platforms have to pump in water to maintain the well pressure and displace the oil and gas,” says Goudie. “My idea is to use surplus electricity from wind farms to pump in the water, and then use the reservoir pressure to generate electricity later on when the wind turbines aren’t turning.” The generated electricity could power machinery on the production platform or be exported to the national grid via the wind farm’s transmission infrastructure, he says. Linking wind farms and oil and gas fields in this way could reduce the wind farms’ operation and maintenance costs and the amount of expensive infrastructure that a new wind farm requires. “Oil and gas reservoirs are often abandoned when there’s still oil and gas left because it’s not economic to invest in upgrading the existing generating and injection equipment,\" Goudie says. “So my system could not only prolong the working life of reservoirs but also use spent reservoirs to store surplus wind energy. The principle could also be applied onshore.” He christened his system wind energy reservoir storage (WERS) and as soon as word began to circulate, Goudie was contacted by major oil and electricity producers. He was even congratulated in the Scottish Parliament and received positive feedback from Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister. Engineering consultants need to be flexible and fast learners, often about things they’ve never encountered before “I also got to meet the chairman of Atkins, Allan Cook,” Goudie says. “He was very enthusiastic too.” Atkins is interested in potentially developing WERS and licensing the technology from Goudie – not bad for a trainee in his first month at work. “This will hopefully offer me the chance to develop it further,” says Goudie. “I’d regret it for the rest of my career if I didn’t pursue this chance. “I’d already been offered the job by Atkins before I won the award, but I think they were impressed that I always tried to go above and beyond what I studied at university. \"Engineering consultants need to be flexible and fast learners, often about things they’ve never encountered before.” Goudie is a firm believer that the STEM Awards are an ideal opportunity for undergraduates to think in this way. “I’ve got a lot out of the awards and I’m very glad I entered,” he says.
