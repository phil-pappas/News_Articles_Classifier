With 71,763 passengers flown in July, Fastjet in fact established a new passenger record in a single month, ahead by 36 percent compared to the same month last year. \nAccording to an airline source, this was largely caused by the launch of flights to Lilongwe a few weeks ago and additional flights from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza. On-time departures were a remarkable 95 percent, while the load factor across the fleet stood at 72 percent. \nThe airline’s CEO, Ed Winter, when making the announcement, said: “We are delighted to be reporting our highest monthly passenger numbers demonstrating the appetite for low-cost aviation in East and Southern Africa. The new schedule underlines our commitment to grow the Tanzanian operation, building frequency on our most popular routes, and significant growth across the route network cements our position in the Tanzanian market. We are now at our target figure for utilization of our existing fleet, and we will shortly be introducing a fourth aircraft into the Tanzanian fleet. \n“In addition, the company has signed a six-year operating lease for the first Airbus A319 aircraft in the fastjet Zimbabwe fleet with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC). This aircraft will be on its way to Zimbabwe this month in readiness for the final stage of the air operator certificate application which is a demonstration flight for the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe. Seats for the first flights by fastjet Zimbabwe will go on sale shortly after the demonstration flight has been completed.” \nFastjet will upscale a number of frequencies to meet growth in demand for domestic and for regional flights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:16:31.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
