This is part of the biggest investment made to the network since the 1930’s, which will see more than 250 new carriages introduced by 2018, providing 30% more space for passengers during the busiest times of the day.\nSouth West Trains secured the extra carriages as part of the Government’s High Level Output Specification Programme (HLOS). The new carriages are Class 458/5 and Class 456 and feature wider doors to help passengers get on and off the train, improved seating, full CCTV and new flooring.\nClass 458/5 services are running on the Windsor line and Class 456 services run to: Guildford, Woking, Dorking and Hampton Court.\nRail Minister Claire Perry said: “We want to see better journeys on a railway fit for the 21st century.‎\n“That is why we are investing in new, more comfortable carriages for thousands of South West Trains’ customers. Passengers will benefit from more space, more seats and better facilities.\n“It’s all part of our long-term economic plan to make the biggest investment in our railways since the Victorian era.”\nChristian Roth, Engineering Director for South West Trains, said: “It is excellent news that the vitally important roll out of 108 additional carriages to our network is now 75% complete. These new carriages are not only providing much more space for passengers on many of our busiest services, they also include significantly improved facilities too.\n“On average, we are introducing one new carriage every week and by early next year all 108 carriages will be in service for passengers.\n“This is a significant step towards the biggest improvements this network has seen for decades and is a major part of our promise to increase space for passengers by 30%.”\nThe investment to increase capacity for passengers by 30% includes works to lengthen platforms 1-4 at London Waterloo during 2017. This will allow longer, 10-car trains to operate on the suburban network for the first time. Platforms at more than 60 stations have already been lengthened.\nIn total, more than 250 new carriages will be introduced. This includes 150 brand new Class 707 Desiro carriages, comprised of 30 five-car trains, as announced in September 2014.\nThe additional carriages are comprised of 24 Class 456 units and 36 Class 458/5 units.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T18:57:10.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
