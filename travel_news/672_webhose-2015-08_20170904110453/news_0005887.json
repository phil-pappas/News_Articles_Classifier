Thanks to new service from Southwest to Belize, the hardest deal destination in Central America is now seeing a lot more reasonable fares. United is now attacking American’s fares to Belize. Availability is EXTREMELY limited – if you can make it work, enjoy. This will not last. \nWhat is The Shorthaul? It is our irregular feature of deals under $200 and 3,000 miles roundtrip. \nBelize City itself is probably not worth visiting. You probably want to visit one of the Cays or Islands. A popular one is Ambergris Caye — you can fly the local carrier Maya Island Air for between Belize City Int’l and Ambergris Caye. If you are part of a big group, it might be worth it to split a taxi and go to the Belize City Municipal Airport to fly to Ambergris Caye instead — based on our check, pricing is usually halved if you fly from there. \nEnglish Caye, Belize – Photo: anoldent via Flickr , used under Creative Commons License (By 2.0) Sample Travel Date: November 14th – 18th Fare Availability: Valid for travel on in August, October, November .
