SFO terminal 2 security checkpoint just shut down and evacuated, everyone told to go outside. Lots of security jogging around. — Mig Greengard (@chessninja) August 23, 2015 We were five people away from going through, of course. — Mig Greengard (@chessninja) August 23, 2015 Guy who told everyone to go outside said not to worry, that \"no planes would be leaving.\" Hmm. — Mig Greengard (@chessninja) August 23, 2015 Outside the evacuated Terminal 2 at SFO. Rumor is reopening in 20 min. Nobody official talking to crowd. pic.twitter.com/WdEjO93B8R — Mig Greengard (@chessninja) August 23, 2015 \nTicket counters inside the terminal remained open while the package was cleared. \nPassengers were rerouted to another boarding area for screening, airport spokesman Doug Yakel said in an email. \nAirport duty manager Jeff Figone said the toy grenades may have been purchased elsewhere by an airport visitor attempting to move them through. . @flySFO Terminal 2 shut down, ppl not allowed in. Emergency vehicles outside. Reason is not clear.
