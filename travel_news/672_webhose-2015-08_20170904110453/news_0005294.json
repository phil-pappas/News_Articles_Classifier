Unit labour costs increase by 5%, which detracts from the competitiveness of the economy and ultimately ... one typically would have higher layoffs in the labour market,\" he said.\nHis comments coincide with wage talks in the gold mining sector. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) have asked for above-inflation wage increases in the sector and threatened to go on strike if employers do not meet their demands.\nProductivity gains would help SA \"accommodate\" higher wage settlements and contribute to improving living standards, the deputy governor said.\nSA, like many other emerging markets, would continue to be affected by global developments, which necessitated the pursuit of local macroeconomic policies that would reduce vulnerability to developments abroad, Mr Groepe said.\nThe rand tumbled to a 14-year low last week in line with other emerging-market currencies after the Chinese monetary authorities devalued their currency to boost their economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:56:03.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
