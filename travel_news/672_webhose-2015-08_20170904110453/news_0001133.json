Cincinnati, the city who originated the streetcar order, is incensed. On Monday, The Cincinnati Enquirer obtained a letter Cincinnati sent to the U.S. subsidiary of Spanish rail company Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles S.A. In the Aug. 6 letter , Patrick Duhaney , the city's chief procurement officer, says he is putting CAF \"on notice\" that the city is ready to do whatever it takes to ensure CAF delivers the streetcars as soon as possible. \"Cincinnati intends to take all steps necessary to hold CAF to its contractual obligations and without compromising vehicle construction quality,\" the letter reads. \"If CAF does not meet its contract milestones, the city will exercise the full extent of its remedies under the contract to force compliance with contract terms and hold CAF accountable for the costs of such delay. These remedies include, but are not limited to, liquidated damages and the withholding of all costs or damages to the city arising out of CAF's failure to meet its contract obligations.\" On Tuesday, Kansas City spokesman Chris Hernandez said the city is also \"investigating its options,\" for how it can compel CAF to complete the streetcar order faster. While Kansas City did not initially consider the CAF delay to be a major issue, it now recognizes it as a \"critical\" delay — meaning late delivery of streetcars will delay the opening of the streetcar project. Cincinnati's Duhaney also says it is \"deeply frustrating\" that CAF did not tell it about missing a major contract milestone sooner and outlines the potential impacts the tardiness of the streetcars could have on Cincinnati's project. \"Infrastructure testing, staff training and other startup activities cannot occur until the vehicles arrive — potentially putting the project on hold and delaying the start of revenue service for every day the vehicles are late,\" the letter reads. \"Delays to vehicle delivery will also have adverse effects on other Cincinnati streetcar contracts including, but not limited to, the streetcar operator contract, the city's civil construction contract, and the city's contract for inspection and engineering support during vehicle production.\" Cincinnati, like Kansas City, is also still searching for reassurances that CAF is making every possible effort to get its deliveries back on track. Duhaney points out that the contract the manufacturer signed with Cincinnati requires CAF to \"make every effort\" to mitigate the delay and to work overtime or extra shifts as necessary in order to complete the contract in a timely manner. \"The city expects to see evidence that CAF is making 'every effort' to remedy this situation,\" the letter said. Like Kansas City, the Enquirer reports, Cincinnati officials expect to hear more from CAF in early September about what exactly is causing the delay and how soon the streetcars will be delivered. Virginia Verdeja , vice president of sales for CAF USA Inc. , to whom the letter was addressed, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. It is unclear what actions Kansas City can take, if any, to compel CAF to deliver its streetcars sooner. The city is charging CAF $1,000 a day for each day it is late for a June 10 delivery — the original date the first streetcar vehicle was to be delivered. CAF has yet to pay any part of the now more than $60,000 fine. On Tuesday evening, the city released images of the cars taken by representatives of Kansas City at CAF's construction facility on July 23 that show a partially completed streetcar vehicle apparently destined for Kansas City. The city signed a nearly $18 million contract with CAF for the delivery of four streetcar vehicles in November 2013. It is piggy-backing on Cincinatti's nearly $21 million contract with the Spanish company. Currently, CAF is now proposing to deliver its first streetcar vehicle to Kansas City in early December. \nWant Kansas City Manufacturing  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T00:06:28.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
