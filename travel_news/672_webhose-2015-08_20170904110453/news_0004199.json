Many worry that scenes like this will become more commonplace throughout the country in years to come\nUS and Cuba announcing new embassies to open The U.S. flag that rises over the Havana waterfront at the symbolic reopening of the U.S. Embassy on Friday will instantly be the most powerful symbol of the American presence in communist, anti-imperialist Cuba. But it will be far from the only one.\nU.S. science fiction master Ray Bradbury has pride of place on their bookshelves beside revolutionary poet Jose Marti.\nImmaculately polished red granite letters spell out 'Woolworth's' in the sidewalk outside a sparsely supplied government-run Havana variety store.\n Next One in two parents are happy to take their children out of... Film student spends loan capturing spine-tingling time-lapse... Forget sailing the seven seas... now you can LIVE on them:... Is this the most entertaining flight attendant ever?... An 'R' and a 'K' poke out from behind the post-revolutionary Banco Metropolitano sign at what used to be the National City Bank of New York.\nThere's a national love of baseball, French fries and milkshakes. Cuba's strain of Caribbean Spanish is rich with borrowed American words.\nSome, such as the greetings 'brother' and 'man,' are as current as the pirated pop culture consumed by the island's youth.\nOthers are comically outdated, like 'bloomers' for women's underwear or 'tencens' for the shops that used to be 10-cent stores before the 1959 revolution.\nCuba is a country whose language, music, literature and fashion are steeped in American influence despite a half-century of official hostility, and artists such as Taylor Swift are popular with residents\n'U.S. influence was very strong and touched every aspect of life, from food to movies,' said cultural critic Ciro Bianchi. 'It has always persisted.'\nObservers of the two countries say U.S.-Cuban cultural ties are about more than shared tastes in sports and movies.\nThe fact that the two countries remained culturally close through decades of conflict is likely to prove essential as the U.S. and Cuba move beyond the reestablishment of diplomatic relations symbolised by Friday's ceremony and enter a new phase of broader economic and political normalisation.\nU.S. cultural influence in Cuba is transmitted from child to parent, among cousins and schoolmates, through the hundreds of thousands of families and groups of friends divided by decades of emigration.\nRelatives and friends living in Florida, New Jersey and Texas return home with new expressions, clothing brands and TV shows and music.\nFidel Castro and other Cuban leaders have long said they opposed the U.S. government, not its people.\nIf you look beyond the antique cars, signs of U.S. influence are prevalent, and are predicted to take greater hold with the opening of the U.S. Embassy on Friday\nAmerican influence is so present and unremarkable that when the government built dozens of state-run gas stations in the 1990s, it painted many with the pre-revolutionary English-language slogan 'friendly service 24 hours' without raising eyebrows.\nFreed from Spain in 1898, Cuba quickly became a virtual colony of the United States, its corrupt politics and oligarchical economy dominated by U.S. interests.\nFrom sugar to telephones to banks, most businesses were U.S. subsidiaries. The casinos and nightclubs that drew swarms of American tourists were owned by U.S. mobsters.\nCuba turned against Washington after Fidel Castro overthrew U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959.\nA generation of Cubans grew up with Russian cartoons, clothes and canned food. But the country never truly shook off its deep ties to North America.\nBradbury is so revered in science fiction-loving Cuba that state television dedicated a lengthy report this week to the 60th anniversary of the Spanish translation of the author's 'Martian Chronicles,' a 1950 book about the colonization of Mars.\nCuba had record 3 million visitors last year, with only 600,000 Americans being able to visit\nEven in the 1970s, at the peak of revolutionary fervor in Cuba, authorities allowed showings of Disney cartoons and American movies like the first two 'Godfather' films, including the famous scenes in 'Part II' showing Mafia meetings on the eve of Castro's takeover of the island.\n'I've traveled a lot through Latin America and I feel more at home in Cuba than in other places,' said Ted Henken, a Cuba expert at Baruch College in New York.\nJazz took root in Cuba with spectacular results and American musical forms influenced other Cuban genres such as son, mambo and timba, art critic Joaquin Borges Triana said.\nThe 'new journalism' of Tom Wolfe and the gritty poetry of Charles Bukowski inspired the writing of Cuba's novisimos, writers who dived into themes of sexual desire and marginalization amid the economic collapse of the 1990s. And American noir detective novels have been a powerful influence on the country's most celebrated contemporary writer, Leonardo Padura.\n'American dirty realism had a strong influence on an entire zone of literature,' Borges said. 'Those writers were the masters for young Cuban writers of that generation.'\nThe strong cultural ties between the U.S. and Cuba 'don't just have to do with globalisation,' Borges said. 'This is about a more profound relationship.'\nSET TO SOAR - THE RISE OF U.S. TOURISM IN CUBA Since news was announced about restored ties between the country, Cuba has seen an increase of 36 per cent of American tourists\nFor decades Americans have not been allowed to visit the island 90 miles off the coast of Miami.\nBut as travel restrictions have eased between the two countries, Americans have been flocking to Cuba to see the 'real Cuba' before it is changed by mass tourism.\nSince Washington announced last year a 'new chapter' with restored links between the US and Cuba, tourism rates have surged, with a 36 per cent jump in the number of Americans heading to the Caribbean island.\nWhen the news of America's renewed ties with Cuba was announced, bookings to Cuba immediately jumped by 57 per cent for one New York tour operator in the weeks that followed despite the fact that the American embargo remains largely in place.\nNew regulations were passed that allowed Americans to visit the country for a number of reasons, without obtaining a special license from the US Government, as was the norm before.\nThese exceptions include family visits, official US government business, education and religious trips.\nThe opportunity has been seized by many Americans, desperate to experience the brightly-coloured 1950s-era cars and unique buildings.\nTravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson echoes the advice of tourists booking a visit sooner rather than later.\nSpeaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Atkinson said: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in.\n'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida.\n'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place.\n'I would urge anyone who is thinking of visiting Cuba to book now; there is something about Cuba that you just can't put your finger on.\n'I would say go now, as you cannot be sure the culture and heritage of Cuba will remain as it is now.'\nVintage cars used to drive tourists around Havana (related)", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1J6h7I1"], "published": "2015-08-14T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:23:21.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
