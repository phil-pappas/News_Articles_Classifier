Part of the backlog was the result of a decision to reduce arrival and departure rates in the Washington area between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Saturday for safety reasons.\nFlights departing from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York that normally flight over the Washington region as they head southward were also affected, although the FAA had said it was trying to route the flights around the affected area.\nThe FAA initially blamed the problem on \"technical issues\" at an air traffic control centre in Leesburg, Virginia. About 4 p.m., the agency said the problem had been resolved, and that officials were working to lift any remaining orders to hold planes on the ground.\nBy midafternoon, 50 per cent of inbound flights and 42 per cent of outbound flights had been cancelled at Reagan National, and delays were averaging about three hours, according to FlightRadar24. In Baltimore, 58 per cent of inbound flights and 36 of outbound flights had been cancelled, and delays were averaging more than an hour.\nInformation posted by the agency Saturday suggested the problem was with the En Route Automation Modernization computer system, known as ERAM, at the Leesburg Center. The agency on Sunday confirmed that the problematic upgrade was to this computer system, however there is \"no indication that the problem is related to any inherent problems with the En Route Automation Modernization system, which has had a greater than 99.99 availability rate since it was completed nationwide earlier this year.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T05:36:40.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
