This growth is forecast to vary country-by-country and by design type. Understanding these dynamics ? particularly the variations and intricacies the market produces ? will be crucial to those seeking to invest in the small UAV market. Homeland security and defence applications are set to grow, particularly as payloads grow to enable collection of a wide variety of data (such as CBRN threats, facial recognition, military ISTAR sensors and others), as are data-collecting applications for research purposes.
