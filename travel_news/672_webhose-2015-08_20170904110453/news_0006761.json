The debut of the contemporary design-led lifestyle brand will ignite the city with its electrifying style, signature Whatever/Whenever® service philosophy and a full calendar of exclusive W Happenings, showcasing what’s new and next in design, fashion and music. \nLocated between the renowned Dam Square and the city’s iconic canal district, right behind the Royal Palace, the hotel is at the epicentre of Amsterdam’s dynamic and energetic cultural scene. W Amsterdam will open its doors to global and local trendsetters on September 21st and the W Insider, a signature role at all W Hotels that connects the destination’s tastemakers and worldly jetsetters, will be ready to provide guests with insider access to the hottest venues and experiences in the Dutch capital. Housed between two iconic properties – the ‘Exchange’, the former Telephone Exchange building, and the ‘Bank’, originally the KAS Bank, the 238-room* W Amsterdam was designed by Office WINHOV, who were responsible for the structural design of the buildings and BK Architects, who imagined and created the interiors. The hotel will mix the individual personalities of both buildings, bringing the historical structures back to their original state while incorporating contemporary and luxurious features. The Exchange building is a visionary structure made up of interesting lines, integrated spaces and captivating views that echo its previous role of connecting the people of Amsterdam with the rest of the world. The Bank building, opening fully in late 2015, will house 66 sophisticated guest rooms, the AWAY Spa and X Bank, an immersive creative incubator concept space that connects local design, fashion and music talents. For visitors looking to stay and play, the 238 stylish guest rooms – including 21 suites, two WOW suites and two lavish Extreme WOW suites – the brand’s take on the Presidential suite, are the ultimate in stylish relaxation. Guests will be able to enter their rooms using SPG Keyless, the hospitality industry’s first keyless entry system allowing guests to use their smartphone or Apple watch as a room key. Taking reference from the iconic Dam Square, the rooms in the Exchange building will provide an elevated sense of space with high ceilings and wide windows. BK Architects has worked with local designers to bring the flavour of Amsterdam to life in every room. From hand-woven bedspreads designed by Bertjan Pot that depict small stories of Dutch culture, to curtains imprinted with classic Amsterdam canal houses and shower cabins inspired by traditional Dutch phone booths, each room will immerse guests in the city. The rooms and suites in the Bank building will have an exclusive look and feel with black and gold bedspreads inspired by the original bank vaults, and pillows that represent the distinctive Amsterdam windowsills. Guests checking into W Amsterdam will be whisked to the rooftop, located on the sixth floor of the Exchange building, where they enter W Lounge, W Hotels’ reinterpretation of the traditional hotel lobby. Globetrotters will be treated to impressive 360-degree views over the city’s canal houses and buzzing streets, as well as unique music programming and an original drinks menu specially created by the dynamic Fabulous Shaker Boys. The East View terrace will allow guests to take a sip as they soak up the energy and sounds of the city. Embracing the history of the building, W Lounge will feature over 5km of copper pipes, paying tribute to the telephone wires and electricity lines that exchanged information on a daily basis when the building was home to Telephone Exchange. Bold gold lines printed on the windows, specially produced by global glass manufacturer Saint Gobain, and a distinctive set of stairs that mimic the steps of Dam Square on the streets below, complete the unique design. “Since its early days as a global trade and shipping hub, Amsterdam has served as a switchboard of cultures and avant-garde ideas. We are excited to unveil W Amsterdam and introduce the brand’s signature style and contemporary design to the Dutch capital,” said Igor Buercher, General Manager, W Amsterdam. “The hotel will also reinforce Amsterdam’s reputation as a city of exchange, bringing new and exciting experiences from the world of fashion, design and music to global travellers and local trendsetters.” The Entourage Group, known for some of Amsterdam’s most talked-about restaurants, all designed by BK Architects, will operate two restaurants; THE DUCHESS and MR PORTER. Set to offer an exciting rooftop-dining experience alongside W Lounge in the Exchange building, MR PORTER showcases a modern take on the traditional steakhouse, blending flavours and world-class service with a dynamic ambiance created by the open kitchen. THE DUCHESS, which opened in June to rave reviews, combines London heritage with Viennese grandeur, offering elegant dining, lunch and afternoon tea alongside a wide selection of vermouths, cocktails and champagnes. Inspired by the history of the former KAS Bank, the restaurant retains a sense of heritage and charm with its high ceilings and original fixtures. W Amsterdam will offer 414 square metres of ultra-modern meeting and event space, including three Great Rooms and two smaller meeting rooms. Later in the year, the hotel will also open FIT®, a state -of-the-art fitness centre and an AWAY Spa®. To top it off, the W brand’s signature Whatever/Whenever® service philosophy and the W Insider will provide guests with whatever they want, whenever they want it, as long as it’s legal!
