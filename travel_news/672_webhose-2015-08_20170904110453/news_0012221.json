Whale-watching tourism has a bright future since Thailand is the only Asean country where people can see Bryde's whales. \nA Bryde’s whale is spotted emerging from the water in the Gulf of Thailand. \nHowever, a proper strategy is needed to ensure sustainable tourism. The Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, in collaboration with Singha Estate, recently launched a pilot version of the Bryde's Whale Watching Guide . The guidebook was co-written by the Marine and Coastal Resources Research and Development Centre (Upper Gulf of Thailand) and marine expert Assist Prof Thorn Thamrongnawasawat. All 200 copies were distributed to the public. A second edition is being prepared and will be published with support from Singha Estate soon. \n\"We can use Bryde's whale tourism to attract highly responsible tourists, improve the reputation of our country and promote ecotourism. Nature and wild animals must be protected and can generate income from tourism,\" said Asst Prof Thorn who is the deputy dean of Kasetsart University's Fisheries Faculty. \nAccording to him, whale watching worldwide generates around 70 billion baht per year. Nonetheless, Thailand has a very small market share, although there is no whale watching tourism elsewhere in Asean. Dolphin watching is also available in Thailand, such as Irrawaddy dolphins at the mouth of the Bang Pakong River in Chachoengsao. \n\"We are seeking co-operation from Tourism Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul to support whale-watching tourism, followed by dolphin watching, including Pacific humpbacked dolphin watching in Nakhon Si Thammarat's Khanom district,\" he added. \nA boat for whale watching in Bang Taboon. \nLek Sukcharoen is a clam farmer at Bang Taboon Community in Ban Laem district, Phetchaburi, where tourists can board boats for Bryde's whale watching. Lek moonlights by operating his boat for whale watching. The boat can accommodate up to 10 people and travel along the coastlines of Phetchaburi to Samut Songkhram. \n\"Tourists usually come here to hire my boat for Bryde's whale watching once a week. The fare is 6,500 baht per day,\" Lek said. \nSurachai Passada, a fisheries official attached to the Marine and Coastal Resources Research and Development Centre (Upper Gulf of Thailand), said Bryde's whales can be spotted in the Gulf of Thailand along the coastline from Samut Songkhram to Phetchaburi all year round, but the best time is between September and November after the monsoon season. There are also chances for visitors to see Irrawaddy dolphins and Pacific humpbacked dolphins in this area, especially near the Mae Klong River. \nAccording to him, four Bryde's whales -- a female named Mae Sakhon and three calves -- live in the gulf near Bang Taboon because this area is fertile and full of mangrove forest. This area has a network of local fishermen and villagers for conserving Bryde's whales. \n\"Two fishing boats in this area regularly participate in whale watching. Local fishermen have a role in supporting the protection of Bryde's whales. They help observe the movements of Bryde's whales,\" Surachai added. \nConcerned agencies regularly provide local villagers with training and knowledge about whale conservation. These villagers already know that boats must be at least 150m way from Bryde's whales and that whales can be seen from a distance of 3-5km. \nHowever, the Bryde's Whale Watching Guide provides extensive information about whale watching. Readers will learn more about what boat operators and tourists should do. Boats must gradually reduce speed to under 12-13kph from a distance of 400m from whales and to under 7kph within 100-300m of whales. Boats should approach whales at their side from a distance of 100-300m -- at least 300m away from whales who are swimming with their calves and at least 100m away from large whales. No more than three boats should approach at one time. \nBoats' engines must be off and operators should avoid changing direction and reduce speed immediately if whales swim towards them. They can move when whales are at least 100m away. Boats must not increase speed to follow them. \nIn addition, the guidebook features photos of different kinds of whales, dolphins and rare marine animals in Thailand and gives more information about Bryde's whales. The Bryde's whale, or Balaenoptera edeni , is a kind of marine mammal. Full-grown Bryde's whales are 15-16.5m long and weigh between 20-30 tonnes. They have no teeth but two rows of baleen plates. They have two blowholes and three parallel ridges on the top of their heads. Their throats and chins are often covered with 40-70 white patches. Their life expectancy is 70. \nIn the upper part of the Gulf of Thailand, 52 Bryde's whales have been found since 2010. Fourteen of them are female and 23 of them are calves. Mother whales spend about two years raising their young. Interestingly, this book shows the photos of scars and unique features of each of these whales. \nMore importantly, this guidebook tells about directions for whale and dolphin watching. It mentions how tourists should prepare themselves and what they should bring for each trip. \nFor example, tourists must not talk loudly and boats must not make loud noises by using large engines or increasing speed because whales make sounds to communicate and send low-frequency underwater calls to one another. In addition, no one should feed whales or swim, snorkel and dive with them. Such animals risk injuries caused by diving gear as well as human related infection. \n\"Thailand has potential for whale watching and safari tourism. But we must have a proper development framework to ensure sustainable tourism. Such tourism will benefit local villagers, boat operators and local restaurants,\" Asst Prof Thorn concluded.
