This photograph of a Sumatran orang-utan in Moscow Zoo has everyone talking about life in captivity. Picture: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters/PICTURE MEDIA Source: Picture Media \nTHIS heartbreaking image shows delighted zoo visitors, with cameras in hand, jostling behind a glass panel as they point and gawk at the orang-utan on the other side. \nMany have smiles plastered on their faces, but the subject of their attention is clearly not sharing the sentiment. Instead, the Sumatran orang-utan sits curled up on top of a rock, with its arms wrapped around its body in a solitary and protective pose. \nIt may all be part of the fun for the tourists visiting Moscow Zoo, but their amusement comes at the expense of the great ape stuck inside. \nChris Draper, program manager for captive wild animals at the Born Free Foundation in the UK, told animal rights website The Dodo : “The picture presents a striking contrast between the zoo visitors and the orang-utan: a moment’s interest and comedy for the visitors and a lifetime’s captivity for the orang-utan.” \nIn the wild, Sumatran orang-utans seek safety in trees and rarely venture on to the ground. But that’s not something that’s always possible in captivity, where they may have no refuge from the prying eyes of humans. \n“Here we see a situation where endless streams of visitors may file past at eye level with this intelligent and sensitive ape,” Mr Draper said. \nThe rights of orang-utans held in captivity is an issue that has been thrust into the spotlight following a world-first legal decision last December, where an Argentine court ruled that an orang-utan called Sandra was entitled to the same basic rights as humans . Time to set the orang-utans free? Picture: Richard Hatherly Source: News Corp Australia \nIt found that she was being subjected to unjust confinement at Buenos Aires Zoo, where she has lived for two decades. Animal rights groups hope the legal battle that is still going on following the ruling will eventually see her set free. \nThe judge is expected to decide within the next few months whether Sandra will be better off in a zoo or a sanctuary.
