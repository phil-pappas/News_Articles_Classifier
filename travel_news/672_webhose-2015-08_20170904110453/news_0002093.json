This tiny country boasts a fun and exciting city, lush tropical forests, volcanoes and pristine beaches. If you want to see it all without having to go to it all, you go to Costa Rica. That is why it is the hottest travel destination for 2015. \nWhen you travel to Costa Rica you can either fly into San Jose or Liberia. San Jose is the big city and most flights to Costa Rica go there. But, there’s another option. You can get flights to Liberia that is on the northern part of their Pacific coast. There are plusses and minuses for both. \nFlights to San Jose are generally cheaper. You can either stay in the city or go directly from the airport to the Pacific coast or north to the most popular jungle destinations and volcanoes. Both are about an hour away. \nFlights to Liberia are generally a little more expensive but you’re already on the Pacific coast. It’s north so you can spend your time travelling south or east if you wanted to enter the mountains, cloud forests and see the volcanoes. If you want to go straight to the beach towns, fly to Liberia. \nThere are lots to see and do in Costa Rica, of course, so it’s important to do your research beforehand on what things you might want to do. One thing we recommend you do nobody your plans is to stay in all inclusive hotels in costa rica . These places will take care of your lodging, food and travel plans. Costa Rica is a small country and it’s possible to do and see a lot by taking daily trips and then returning back to the resort in the afternoon or night. \nAll inclusive resorts are mostly found on the Pacific coast and in the best locations. If you want just a nice relaxing vacation in a beautiful tropical location, then you don’t even have to leave the all inclusive resort. You can eat every meal there, enjoy their pools, beaches and other amenities. \nThe language of Costa Rica is Spanish, their currency is the colon, for transportation there are taxis, busses and you can rent a car. If you don’t speak Spanish, you may have trouble doing everything you wanted to do. If you don’t have colones, exchanging money might be a problem. And transportation, you don’t want to take the bus, deal with taxi drivers or spend unnecessary money on a rental car. Go to an all inclusive resort that will eliminate all of those problems. \nCosta Rica is the hottest destination for 2015 and for good reason. It has city life, beaches, volcanoes and tropical forests but it can still be difficult travel. Make life easier and your trip better by staying at an all inclusive resort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T10:54:46.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
