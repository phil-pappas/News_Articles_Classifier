The service begins on 18 April 2016 and will operate to 27 October 2016. \nEdinburgh will be served by three flights a week operated by a Finnair Airbus A319. \nGordon Dewar, Chief Executive, Edinburgh Airport, said: “This is a significant route for Scotland and one we have been working very hard to secure. Not only will it give Scots fantastic connections to the Far East via Finnair’s excellent hub in Helsinki, it will also open up our country to significant traffic from Russia, China, Japan and Finland itself. \n“I hope that this is the beginning of Edinburgh Airport further strengthening Scotland’s links with these key global destinations.” \nFinnair is the European launch customer for the next-generation Airbus A350 XWB aircraft. It is also the first airline in the world to operate the A350 on scheduled services to China, where Shanghai will be served with a daily A350 service from 25 October, followed by Bangkok and Beijing, with Hong Kong and Singapore A350 services to be added in 2016. \nThe Edinburgh service is one of four new Finnair routes being introduced in summer 2016, with the launch of services from Helsinki to Billund (Denmark); Pula (Croatia); and also the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T07:47:31.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
