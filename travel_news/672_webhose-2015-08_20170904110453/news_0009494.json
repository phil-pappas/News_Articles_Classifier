The number of daily flights and the Airline Quality Rating score are also taken into consideration.\n“Many travel loyalty programs come with a string of caveats, making it challenging to maximize your rewards,\" Liz Weiss, travel editor for U.S. News & World Report, said in a statement. \"Our rankings highlight the programs that make it easy to earn free flights or hotel stays and offer plenty of reward options and perks travelers value, such as upgrades, free checked bags and priority boarding access.\"\nUSA TODAY\nAlaska Air, JetBlue take top spots in JD Power airline survey\nYou can see the full list of rankings, along with scoring breakouts and helpful pros and cons for each airline reward program that was evaluated, here .\nCurious about the hotel side of the rankings ? Marriott Rewards lands in the top spot for the third year in a row, followed by Wyndham Rewards, Best Western Rewards and Club Carlson — which tied for third place — and the IHG Rewards Club.\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \" At the Airport \" columnist.
