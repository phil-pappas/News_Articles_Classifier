Tax revenues have recovered to pre-crisis levels and expenditures are being kept under strict control,” said Nicole Laframboise, who led the mission to the country. “The Government has continued to repay its budget expenditure arrears and is expected to clear them fully by the end of this year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T23:08:34.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
