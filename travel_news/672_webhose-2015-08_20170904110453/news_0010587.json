Be aware that you need to have a 4-digit pin number to use many European ATMs. \nI always try to get some local currency for the place I'm starting from. You might try getting some at a currency exchange office in a major city near you or at the airport. You'll take a minor hit on the exchange rate, but you can buy a coffee as soon as you land. \nI do take a couple of traveler's checks. Just in case. European Money Matters Directory \nYour Budget \nOk, so you've got everything pretty much in hand now. How much do you need per day in Europe? Well, it's hard to say. If you have reserved all your lodging, you know what that costs. The same with your transportation. I'd leave about 25 Euros a day per person for entrance fees, incidentals, and local transportation. Food is a variable, and depends on where you'll be eating. I find the cost of food to be pretty much the same as in the US. Wine is much cheaper. Your European Vacation - How Much Will it Cost? \nKeeping Your Stuff Secure \nMost travelers recommend a money belt or pouch worn under your clothing to protect your cash, credit cards and passport. \nDon't wear a fanny pack with the pack turned around to actually ride on your fanny. It looks stupid and is a magnet for thieves. Women should avoid big purses with shoulder straps. Those straps can be cut and the purse removed by a thief in seconds. Whatever can be said about European petty thieves and pickpockets one thing stands out: they're good at what they do.
