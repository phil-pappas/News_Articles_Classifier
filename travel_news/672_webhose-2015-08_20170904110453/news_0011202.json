The new flight schedule will better support the promotion of Guam’s signature events in the Taiwan market. China Airlines previously serviced Guam twice a week, departing Taipei on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 11PM and arriving on Guam at 4:30AM the next day. \n“We are excited that China Airlines will be providing more flight options to Guam. The shift from early morning to afternoon arrivals to Guam is a welcome change because it provides greater convenience and a better experience for passengers,” said GVB General Manager Nathan Denight. “Taiwan has always been a valuable market for our island and it will now be much easier for our Taiwanese visitors to participate in Guam signature events, activities, and experiences that can be found only on Guam.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:17:20.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
