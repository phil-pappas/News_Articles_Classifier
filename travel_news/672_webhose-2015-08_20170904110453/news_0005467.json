While the three-engine aircraft launched with both American air carriers Eastern Air Lines and United Airlines, the very first 727 ultimately ended up in United’s fleet.\nBy the time the 727 ended production, over 1800 aircraft in multiple variations were delivered to airlines around the world. Today, it’s estimated that just 100 727s remain in commercial service.\nAlthough the first 727 aircraft was donated to the Museum of Flight in Washington in 1991, volunteers have believed for years that the aircraft still had one more flight left in it.\nNow, they are finally hoping to prove it, when the aircraft takes to the skies bound for the Museum of Flight’s main campus in Seattle.\n“When this thing came here, I figured that was it and if it ever got downtown, it was going to be cut up and hauled down on trucks,” Bob Bogash, a retired Boeing engineer working as the project manager, told local news website KING-TV .\n“I had to convince a whole series of museum managements that yes, we could fly it.”\nFinal flight? Picture: InSapphoWeTrust Source: Flickr\nWhile volunteers have been working on restoring the aircraft for over a decade, airworthiness preparations are being finalised over the next two months.\nThe aircraft had to be fitted with new transmissions, actuators and jackscrews, while the specialised engines were donated by FedEx, taken from of a former 727 freight aircraft.\nWhile the aircraft is not airworthy yet, the volunteer crew is optimistic the final flight can take place in October 2015. Once the flight is complete, the aircraft will be on display as part of the museum’s permanent collection.\nMore travel news at FlyerTalk.com .\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/last-flight-for-boeings-first-727/story-fn6yjmoc-1227488145036?sv=d9306e0c4932b660422015c0ca2278ec&title=Last+flight+for+Boeing%26%238217%3Bs+first+727", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/last-flight-for-boeings-first-727/story-fn6yjmoc-1227488145036?sv=d9306e0c4932b660422015c0ca2278ec", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/last-flight-for-boeings-first-727/story-fn6yjmoc-1227488145036?sv=d9306e0c4932b660422015c0ca2278ec", "http://www.flyertalk.com/", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/last-flight-for-boeings-first-727/story-fn6yjmoc-1227488145036?sv=d9306e0c4932b660422015c0ca2278ec&h=Last+flight+for+Boeing%26%238217%3Bs+first+727", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Last+flight+for+Boeing%26%238217%3Bs+first+727&c=THE+very+first+Boeing+727+was+a+revolutionary+aircraft+when+it+rolled+out+of+the+factory+more+than+50+years+ago.+So+what+will+happen+to+it+now%3F&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/last-flight-for-boeings-first-727/story-fn6yjmoc-1227488145036?sv=d9306e0c4932b660422015c0ca2278ec", "http://www.king5.com/story/tech/science/aerospace/2015/08/12/boeing-first-727-ready--final-flight/31581179/", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/last-flight-for-boeings-first-727/story-fn6yjmoc-1227488145036?sv=d9306e0c4932b660422015c0ca2278ec&title=Last+flight+for+Boeing%26%238217%3Bs+first+727"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:38:49.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
