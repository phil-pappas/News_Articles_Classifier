We've been a territory since 1999, that's sixteen years. It's the newest territory in Canada. I don't get why it's left off.\"\nThe centre receives many tourist visits with five major passenger cruise ships stopping in Cambridge Bay during the summer, said Ootoova, but many visitors lack knowledge about Nunavut's history and culture. He said more education about Nunavut is needed and leaving it off a map of the country doesn't help.\nWildrose tourism critic Ron Orr said the artistically-rendered map \"disregards aboriginal and Inuit status and disregards the status of Nunavut itself\" and criticized the agency's \"bloated bureaucracy\" for not catching the error before print.\nTravel Alberta promptly admitted the design error and apologized on Monday.\n\"It was an error on our end and we do apologize if it causes any concern or confusion for anyone. We are correcting the imagery to ensure it doesn't happen again,\" said spokesperson Jennifer Anderson.\nAnderson couldn't say how widely the advertisement was circulated but said the map was included as part of a ten-page \"call to action\" showcasing Alberta's major tourism destinations in the June edition of United Airlines' Hemisphere Magazine.\n\"We hope that our tourism friends in Nunavut understand this was a mistake and we're going to be reaching out to them as well,\" she said. \"We want to always ensure the accuracy of our marketing.\"\nTravel Alberta is the tourism marketing agency of the Government of Alberta that is governed by the Travel Alberta Act and a Board of Directors accountable to the Minister of Culture and Tourism.\nmatthew.dykstra@sunmedia.ca\n@SunMattDykstra\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTravel Alberta apologizes for an advertisement featuring a map of Canada missing the border lines for Nunavut\nBy Matt Dykstra , Edmonton Sun First posted: Monday, July 27, 2015 07:01 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, July 28, 2015 09:27 AM EDT\nAlberta's tourism marketing agency is apologizing for overlooking Canada's largest territory.\nIn a June advertisement promoting the ease and affordability of travelling to Alberta from major American cities such as Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago, the map of Canada used by Travel Alberta is missing the border lines for Nunavut.\nThe advertisement was posted to the popular link-sharing site Reddit on Monday where it was heavily mocked by users under the title \"This Travel Alberta ad forgot Nunavut exists\".\n\"It is disappointing,\" said Ipeelie Ootoova, manager of the Arctic Coast Visitor Centre in Cambridge Bay, a hamlet located on Victoria Island in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut that's famous for its fishing and archaeological sites.\n\"A lot of people don't know anything about Nunavut, how we live, our culture, even if they're Canadian so I think it should be shown everywhere,\" he said.\n\"They shouldn't be leaving it as part of the Northwest Territories.\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Justin Trudeau hits boxing ring ahead of debate\n0\nRob Ford blasts fellow councillors' spending habits\n0\nPoll assesses Wynne pension plan, toll lanes\n0\nJays bats cancel out Hutchisonâ€™s rough outing vs. Twins\n0\nMADD P.E.I. chapter president resigns after impaired driving charges\n0\nManhunt for suspect after Louisiana officer shot, killed\n0\nJustin Trudeau hits boxing ring ahead of debate\n0\nMiles Teller fires back at Esquire after they label him a d---\n0\nTrump centre stage as Republicans to face off in first debate\n0\nMalaysia confirms plane debris is from Flight MH370\n0\nTunnel takes flight\nJays acquire two before trade deadline\nBlue Jays make Sick Kids's day better\nPrice shopper\nSSG Tonya\nMore from Canada Canada's top 10 underrated destinations 0\nHalifax replica trench offers interactive glimpse of life in World War One 0\nTop 10 campsites in Canada 0\nRV lets family hit the road with hotel perks 0\nTop #SUNtravelpics reader photos from July 2015 0\nInside Toronto sun.com News\nManhunt on after Louisiana cop killed 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-07-28T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:56:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
