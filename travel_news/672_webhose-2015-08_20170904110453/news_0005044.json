Published on : Friday, August 7, 2015\nAlmost a year and a half passed after the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared with 239 people on board. However, the tensions regarding the foul play by the Malaysian airline is still surfacing the leading stories in the airline industry. On Friday, as many as 100 family members (mostly Chinese) had gathered at a Malaysia Airlines outlet in Beijing to question the airline on the flaperon found in the French island of Reunion last week.\nAccording to reports, international media were blocked from attending the Beijing meeting between the relatives of the Chinese passengers and the Malaysia Airlines officials. Last day, the families pointed out the differences between the announcement of the Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and that of the French prosecutors who are heading the examination of the wreckage. The French experts are yet to confirm that the debris found are from the missing MH370.\nThe tension is rising as most of the family members refused to attend the meeting over the ban of international media and some of them who attended the meeting left the place soon after receiving the same information as announced earlier by the Malaysian PM.\nThe meeting lacked any attendance from the Malaysian government officials or the Malaysian ambassador to China.\nFamily members sat on their knees pleading representatives from the international media to help them in learning the fate of their near and dear ones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:11:51.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
