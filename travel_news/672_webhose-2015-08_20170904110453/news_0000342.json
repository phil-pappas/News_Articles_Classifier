When Miami-based HavanaAir first announced the flights last month , the private airline said flights were expected to begin in August. However, the Houston Airport System was still working with the airline on final details, HAS spokesman Bill Begley told the Houston Business Journal at the time. Now, Begley tells the Houston Chronicle flights might begin sometime in September, though there still isn’t a definitive start date yet. HavanaAir plans to utilize Miami-based Eastern Air Lines Group Inc.’s Boeing 737-800 aircraft for the flights, which will operate on Wednesdays between Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Havana, Cuba. The airlines also partnered to operate two flights a day to Havana from Miami , with additional flights to the Cuban cities of Santa Clara and Camaguey. A spokesman for Eastern Air Lines did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Barack Obama restored diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this year. Americans authorized to travel to Cuba for various reasons — such as family visits, official U.S. government business, journalism, education and more — do not need to apply for special licenses. However, general tourism is still not allowed, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website. \nWant Houston Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
