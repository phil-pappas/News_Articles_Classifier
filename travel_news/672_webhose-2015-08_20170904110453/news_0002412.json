This is an exciting move for ibtm world in the evolution of our Knowledge Programme and we could not have done it without the continued support from our partner ACS audiovisual solutions, who helped us deliver the vision of creating a Knowledge Programme hub on the show floor.”\nJessica Ylstra, Managing Director, ACS audiovisual solutions, commented: “We are proud to intensify our partnership! We have been working together for years with ibtm and are happy with our cooperation. With our new partnership we are able, together with our IT partner Eventresult, to bring our combined solutions to the next level. The wishes of ibtm events inspire us to develop new, interactive and innovative AV and IT facilities. This year, we will build four temporary rooms to accommodate all ibtm lecture sessions and we will integrate a new and refreshing concept. We hope our services will create a buzz and intensify the experience of the ibtm visitors and exhibitors!”\nThis year, ibtm world is introducing seven new global themes to underpin its 2015 Knowledge Programme, which will be led by an exciting line up of influential industry experts on the many and diverse topics facing the industry now and in the future.\nSource:-ibtm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:51:53.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
