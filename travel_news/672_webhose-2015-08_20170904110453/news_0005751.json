During the month, passenger volume rose by 6.6% to 6.0 million, while flight movements increased by 2.7% to 34,185, when compared to the same month last year. Cargo throughput experienced a 1.9% year-on-year drop to 363,000 tonnes.\nThe growth in passenger traffic in July was mainly driven by transfer/transit traffic and Hong Kong resident traffic, which registered 12% and 11% growth, respectively, over the same month last year. Passenger traffic to/from Southeast Asia and Japan recorded the most significant increases.\nThe decline in cargo throughput last month was driven mainly by a 5% year-on-year drop in transshipments. Exports declined by 1% compared to the same month last year. During the month, cargo throughput to/from Mainland China, Taiwan and Europe underperformed other key regions.\nDuring the month, HKIA welcomed a new airline – Sky Lease Cargo, which began operating scheduled cargo flights to Miami twice a week with its Boeing 747 freighter from 16 July.\nSeparately, Australian online travel platform Australian Business Traveller named HKIA as the ‘Best International Airport’ for 2015. The traveller website’s editors commended HKIA for its traveller-friendly footprint, extensive shopping outlets and attractive lounges – as well as the Airport Express Line that shuttles passengers between the airport and Hong Kong’s city centre in less than half an hour.\nVivian Cheung, Deputy Director, Airport Operations of Airport Authority Hong Kong said, “This award is a great recognition for HKIA, and stands as testament to the concerted efforts of the 65,000-strong airport community. We will continue to improve our facilities and services in order to enhance passengers’ airport experience, leveraging on new technology to ensure travelling at HKIA as easy as possible. ”\n“Meanwhile, taking an opportunity to enjoy the summer with passengers from all over the world, the airport is staging ‘The Sound of Summer Music’ performance in the Meeters and Greeters Hall from now until 21 August. Students from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts will perform classic and joyful songs from Rodgers & Hammerstein’s ‘The Sound of Music’ to celebrate the 50th anniversary of this world-famous musical,” added Mrs Cheung.\nSource:-HKIA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T08:07:20.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
