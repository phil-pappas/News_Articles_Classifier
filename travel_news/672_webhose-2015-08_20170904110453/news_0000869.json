For the 2nd time in the 12-year history of the Copper Skillet competition, there was a Junior Chef category where IACC conference centre chefs under the age of 26 competed in the cook-off. Junior and senior category winners now go on to compete in the IACC-Europe final to be held in Milan in October. The winners of the European cook-off (one senior chef and one junior chef) will go on to compete with other chefs from IACC chapters around the world at the International Copper Skillet Competition at the IACC-Americas Connect Annual Meeting Central New York in April 2016 where the 12th Global Copper Skillet Champion will be named. The popular Copper Skillet competition was introduced in 2004 to highlight the artistry and skill of the best chefs from IACC-member conference centres around the world and to honour their contributions to the shared goal of providing an outstanding conference centre experience.
