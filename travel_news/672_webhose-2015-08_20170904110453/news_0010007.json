The forest is located in the south-east Bangladesh and is home to the Bengal tiger.\nThe police found three tiger pelts that were seized from the animals that appeared to be freshly killed.\nMany tigers have succumbed to poaching and the numbers have dwindled to 100 out of the 440 recorded a decade ago. The major slump has been largely attributed to poaching.\nThe poachers began to shoot back at the policemen during the raid. The gunfight went on for about 15-20 minutes. Three tiger skins and five guns and ammunitions were recovered by the police.\nThe government will be taking special efforts to block poaching. The numbers of the Bengal tiger have declined in India and Bangladesh where the majority of the tigers lived in the Sundarban delta. There are few still found in Nepal, Bhutan, China and Myanmar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:05:33.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
