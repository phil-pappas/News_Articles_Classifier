This new service is currently in its test phase, but from September will be fully activated and the current newspaper counters will close.\nThis free service is available via the TAP mobile app for TAP Clients travelling on flights operated by the company.\nThe newspapers and magazines must be downloaded before boarding, and can be read offline on your smartphone or tablet. You can use your booking code to download your titles up to 72 hours prior to departure and after checking in; however, if you want a title that is published on the day of travel you must download it on that day.\nDepending on the rules of your fare, you will have access to a different number of publications on each flight:\ntap|executive: can download up to seven different titles; tap|plus: has three titles available; tap|classic and tap|basic: can download two titles; tap|discount: has access to just one title.\nVictoria Silver Clients can download three titles, while Victoria Gold Clients can download up to seven titles. If you hold a tap|corporate or a TAP AMEX Platinum card, you will have access to seven titles (except when travelling on tap|discount, when the rules of the fare apply).\nFree physical copies of newspapers and magazines will be available after 1 September in the Lounge and in long-haul Business Class.\nWith this change, passengers will receive an improved range of titles and will no longer be restricted to those publications available at the newspaper counters or in-flight. The range of publications depends on the titles available on the chosen digital platform. TAP is making every effort to gradually increase the range of titles to choose from.\nThe company continues to follow industry trends, with this model allowing a reduction in aircraft weight with resulting environmental benefits.\nSource:- TAP Portugal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:17:23.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
