During the Ruhrtriennale Festival of the Arts, you can enjoy exhilarating drama, dance and music theatre as well as new installations at former industrial buildings – from coking plants to power stations. These provide breathtaking backdrops for a programme of opera, music theatre, pop and electronic music, all tied together by this year’s theme of musical fusions.\nBe sure not to miss it!\nTo complement a trip to the festival, take a stroll through Duisburg-Nord Industrial Landscape Park with its hands-on attractions or visit the Ludwig Gallery at Oberhausen Palace, which you can follow with a boat ride.\nSource: GNTB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:51:06.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
