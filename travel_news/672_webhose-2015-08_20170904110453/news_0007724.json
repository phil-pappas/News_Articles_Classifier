Hungarian airline Wizz Air is still challenging this ruling and the CAA has referred the matter to the Hungarian Authority for Consumer Protection.\nJet2 has agreed to process compensation claims dating back six years and both Jet2 and Aer Lingus have now agreed to improve the quality of information they provide to passengers during disruptions and have signed legal undertakings confirming this.\nAndrew Haines, chief executive of the CAA, said: “We’re now in the busiest time of the year for air travel and UK passengers are right to expect that if they experience disruption their airline will look after them. Our work is about making sure that is exactly what happens.\n“During the last year we’ve stepped in to make sure a number of major airlines change their approaches and improve the support provided to their passengers.\n“The results of our recent action are a further boost for UK passengers and we are very pleased to see the changes the airlines involved have made. But our work is not done.\n“We are determined to stand up for passengers and will continue to review how airlines are treating, and responding to, their customers in practice.\n“Furthermore, while we recognise not every claim for compensation will be eligible, we are keen to hear from people who feel they have not been treated fairly and where we believe airlines are not complying with the law, we will pursue all available enforcement options.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-19T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:07:57.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
