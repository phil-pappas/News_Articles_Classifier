A photo posted by FlyNYON (@flynyon) on Aug 8, 2015 at 12:59pm PDT \nA quick scan of social media will tell you that the shoe selfie is no new thing - Twitter and Instagram users have long been taking photos of their feet for their feed. But never have their appendages looked so remarkable. \nTo dangle your feet off the side off the chopper and steady your hands to take a photo certainly requires nerves of steel, as the ground beckons beneath you and the blades thunder above. \n• 10 most popular places to take a selfie \nFlyNYON’s website says the flights are the “ultimate aerial photo experience”. It says: “Be like the pros and harness into our helicopter with open doors, giving you visual access to the world below. \n“Use your creative eye to capture the images that inspire you and challenge your photographic skills. Don’t be fooled, it is not as easy as it looks, but it sure is fun and will encourage you to come back for more.” \nThe site says the trip will not go ahead if the weather is so poor that they are unable to fly or take pictures, however, “some of the best images come when the weather is not perfectly clear”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T15:05:46.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
