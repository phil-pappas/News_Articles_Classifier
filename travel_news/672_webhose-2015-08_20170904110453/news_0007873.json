The launching, which took place this morning, was picture perfect. Immediately after being launched seamlessly, tugboats skillfully nudged the new riverboat into Chesapeake Shipbuilding’s East Outfitting Basin where the upper decks and outfitting will be completed. \nThe launching comes just a few weeks after the joining of the two hull sections. With the installation of the upper decks, the new riverboat will come together quickly, and upon completion will be the third new riverboat built for the Mississippi River by American Cruise Lines. Construction of the new \"Queen of the Mississippi\" is also underway and is slated for delivery in 2017. \nThe newest paddlewheeler \"America\", will have a capacity of 185 passengers and will introduce features never before seen on a riverboat. American built, American flagged and American crewed, this new vessel symbolizes the true all-American experience provided by American Cruise Lines. It is scheduled to begin navigating the Mississippi River and its tributaries next spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T22:42:47.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
