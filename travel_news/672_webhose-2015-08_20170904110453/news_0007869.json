Seychelles is of course also known for the diversity of islands that make these islands what they are as they offer both granitic mountain-clad islands as well as flat coral islands all offering unrivaled swimming with immaculate white sandy beaches that are lapped with clear and clean turquoise blue seas that remains warm on a year-round basis. \nBut Seychelles is also known across the world as a religious tolerant country, allowing everyone to not only observe, but to also practice, their faith freely. Today, even though the Roman Catholic Church still remains the predominant church of the islands, one can appreciate the diversity of faiths and religions in these mid-ocean islands. The Anglican Church, the Bahai Centre, the Hindu Temple, the Muslin Mosques, the Buddhists, the Adventists Church, and Pentecostal Churches, among others, are all set up side by side offering a rare atmosphere of total harmony through the inter-faith body that meets often to ensure everyone is seen and noticed. \nIt is against this backdrop that Minister Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, jumped to the opportunity when he was invited to see for himself the great Bahai center of Hyfa as he was in that Israeli city for a few hours during his working visit. \"Understanding and appreciating faiths and religions of the world helps anyone better understand ourselves,\" said the Seychelles Minister. \"The imposing Bahai center with its immaculate manicured gardens remain a must-visit site, because this side of Israel with its own diversity of faiths, few appreciate unless Israel has been visited,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
