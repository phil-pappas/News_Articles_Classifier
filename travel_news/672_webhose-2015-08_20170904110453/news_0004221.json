Backroads has just unveiled 27 new biking trips, 41 new multisport adventures and 21 new walking & hiking trips for the 2015-2016 season, as well as new options for active travel including river cruise biking trips, river cruise walking trips, solo trips, snow adventures and trips to undiscovered hotspots. \nRolling Down the River Active river cruising continues to be extremely popular and this year Backroads is rolling out cruises to more locations in Europe, as well as the Mekong Delta in Cambodia and Vietnam. Families can join the fun on new active river cruises designed just for them; Breakaway trips are designed especially for families with older teens and 20-somethings. \nIn 2016 Backroads will launch new river cruise trips along the Danube, Mekong Delta, Rhine, Seine and Portugal's Douro. Additionally, an entire ship just for Backroads guests sets sail on a Danube Full Ship Celebration River Cruise Bike Tour in September 2016. \nFamily Fun and Freedom for Older Teens & 20-Somethings Family Breakaway trips have proven to be a huge hit for families with older teens and college-age kids seeking the perfect blend of time together and independent activities. To meet increasing demand, Backroads is tripling the options for families in the coming year, launching new Family Breakaway Trips to England, the Basque Region of France & Spain, Croatia & Montenegro, Alaska, the Canadian Rockies, Argentina's Lake District, Peru, Patagonia, and New Zealand, as well as a Rhine River Cruise. These trips join an already-popular roster of Family Breakaway trips in Tuscany, the Dalmatian Coast, Hawaii and Costa Rica. \nOff the Beaten Path Active Adventures Backroads is offering several trips to top travel destinations that explore their undiscovered treasures and off-the-beaten-path features. These trips venture beyond Tuscany's well-trod paths for a Tuscan Coast bike tour and explore Camino de Santiago rather than mainstream Spain. A Parma to Verona tour explores an often-missed side of Northern Italy, and a Croatia trip has been expanded to include Montenegro. \nSouped-Up Selection for Solos Backroads Solos trips remain a top choice for active travelers, and in 2016 the offerings expand to include the Amalfi Coast, Canadian Rockies, Croatia & Montenegro, Morocco, California's Redwood Empire, Yosemite, the Camino de Santiago in Spain & Portugal, Maui & Lanai, Palm Springs & Joshua Tree, and Peru. \nRevamping Camping Camping is another fast-growing area for Backroads, and guest feedback continues to reinforce the notion that people love to camp but many don't want to do all of the work associated with it. In addition to new itineraries and more dates offered, new in 2016 on all camping trips are cozy cots with Thermarests on top for better slumbering off of the ground. The company has seen a growing interest in camping trips among both families and solo travelers. Backroads has developed camping trips where previously only hotel-based itineraries were offered, including Alaska, Banff to Jasper, Bryce, Zion & Grand Canyon, Glacier & Waterton Lakes, the San Juan Islands and Yellowstone & Tetons. \nEurope and Beyond Backroads has been recognized for its award-winning European tours ( www.backroads.com/award-winning-tour/Europe ) and continues to expand its offerings there and abroad. \"We know that many of our guests like to explore new and different locations around the globe, and we want to be their go-to option for active travel,\" said Backroads Founder and President Tom Hale. \"Our trip experts are always on the lookout for intriguing new destinations, immersive new experiences and fun new activities. We are pleased to offer such a huge selection of trips that are always evolving to meet our guests' interests.\" \nA sampling of new 2016 Backroads Trips is listed below; visit www.backroads.com for complete new trip offerings, pricing and information. \nBiking Tours Danube Full Ship River Cruise England French Pyrenees & Spain's Rioja Region Mekong River Cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T16:25:36.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
