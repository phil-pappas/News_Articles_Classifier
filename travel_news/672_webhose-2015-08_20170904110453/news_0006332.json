It’s the tenderloin of the season, so the boys and girls with the heavy pockets are choppering into that tiny, coveted, bejewelled and hugely overbuilt 170-mile-long stretch of high, rocky northern-Mediterannean shoreline that runs from Portofino west through Monte Carlo, Nice, and Cannes, to Cassis and Toulon.\nThe harbormasters of the very few deepwater havens – notably, around Antibes – break out in sweaty fits as they try to parse which few megayachts they can actually accomodate, versus which billionaires they must instruct to anchor out. Essentially, it’s a kind of distance tax, the 30-minute commute in on the tender, or the 10-minute commute in on the onboard chopper.\nDuring the stampede’s high point – approximately, now, from the annual Leonardo DiCaprio environmental fundraiser in St. Tropez, to the end of August – the land-based service personnel are also caught up in fits of shakes: maitres d’hote, security guards, cabana boys and not least, the parking valets who can find themselves at the wheel of a 2-million-dollar Veyron one second and a three-million-dollar Maclaren the next.\nDiCaprio and his current plucked-from-the-Victoria’s-Secret-catalog companion, Kelly Rohrbach, sailed in for his party last week – raising more than $40 million, not too shabby for an evening’s work – but a couple of days back he offloaded Ms. Rohrbach in Cannes. At last dispatch, there were still some ladies lounging patiently on his boat, for no known – or perhaps for a known – reason. It seems Ms. Rohrbach might have left the boat too early.\nSpeaking of harems at the ready, mega-boy-band-fabricator Simon Cowell has not yet this year begun his annual superyacht-rental week squiring a rotating cast of his former, current and any possible future girlfriends. This is, or was, dependable annual entertainment at 400,000 to 500,000-per-week, depending on the yacht, thus was anxiously awaited by all service industry professionals in all ports. Unclear, this year, is whether rival schlockmeister and also dependable Cote d’Azur party-boat renter Sean “Puffy“/“Diddy“ Combs and his entourage have been delayed by his recent shoreside indictment for attacking his son’s coach with kettlebells. Everybody is still hoping for Diddy to make it. Still, it’s the Cote d’Azur, so there have been some spectacular cameos. Super-cougar fashion- and TV-mogul Heidi Klum was until recently prowling St. Tropez with her boy, Vito Schnabel, but she has now has decamped with him down to Sardinia, where, in their bathing suits on the beach, they continue to simulate the sex they are having off the beach.\nEspecially on the Cote d’Azur, it’s all about the squeeze.\nSo, it was with a cocktail of emotion – one part trepidation, three parts anticipation of some superheavy tipping – that the service industry welcomed King Salman of Saudi Arabia to this year’s mix. Although the al-Saud family has owned its vast mansion in the village of Vallauris for decades, over the last couple of weeks, there have been some cultural and political frictions.\nFirst, the King travels heavy. A reported one thousand people accompanied him, a figure that puts both Cowell, Puffy, Ron Burkle, and any ten other occidental moguls’ entourages to shame. We will hasten to add that the entire battalion is not staying in the al-Saud family’s immense royal villa in Vallauris. According to the tally, this figure would include the courtiers, hangers-on, and wannabes, along with their families, who will be bunking (still, at great private cost) elsewhere. In a lovely expression of medieval manners, it’s all about being where the court is. And for the next three weeks, the court is in residence in Vallauris.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:58:30.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
