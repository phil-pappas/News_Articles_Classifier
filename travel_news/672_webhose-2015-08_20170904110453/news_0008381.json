Page 1 of 1 \nThe Vikings, it turns out, knew a thing or two about real estate and marketing. \nWhen the first Viking settlers came to Iceland, legend has it that they switched the name for the island with that of its closest neighbor — a move intended to encourage settlement of ice-covered Greenland so the Vikings could keep the surprisingly green Iceland to themselves. \nEleven centuries later, the Vikings’ deceit no longer keeps visitors away. Since 2003, tourism to Iceland has tripled, and there’s growing concern that the number may be more than the small country can handle. In 2015, more than a million people are expected to visit — more than three times the island’s population of around 330,000 people. \nMost of those 330,000 people live in the capital, Reykjavik, and in high season, tourists can easily outnumber the locals and overwhelm the small city and the surrounding area. But in the vast countryside, there’s no shortage of wide open spaces. Iceland is roughly the size of Kentucky, with about 7 percent of its population. \nOutside of the capital region, on average, each square mile is shared with just eight people. \nMy husband, Dan, and I are in Iceland for our second trip, and are headed to Husavík, 300 miles to the northeast on the opposite side of the country as Reykjavik. Given that it’s offseason — that is, any month other than June, July and August — we expect the number of fellow travelers we encounter to be few. \nWe want to see what’s out there in all that empty space. And to see what the Vikings wanted (and Icelanders still want) to keep to themselves. \nA speck of a town tucked into the eastern side of Skjalfandi bay, Husavík may have been the first place those early Vikings saw when they arrived in Iceland as a small group led by Swede Garðar Svavarsson in A.D. 870. The name Husavík means “bay of houses,” and today it’s home to only 2,300 people, barely putting it in the ranks of the country’s top 20 most populous towns. \nAside from the tiny harbor, there’s a church, gas station, whale museum, three restaurants, a few dozen brightly colored aluminum-sided houses, a grocery store and a liquor store that stays open no later than 7 p.m., even on Saturday night. \nWe’re staying at Kaldbaks-kot, a small collection of modest wooden cabins a little more than a mile outside of town. Every cabin has a compact bedroom, a basic kitchen and bathroom, and a deck with an unobstructed view of the bay and the moss-covered mountains on the opposite side. Down a slight hill from the cabins, there’s a pond ringed with wildflowers, and then the land dead-ends at a cliff and disappears over the edge. \nWe appear to be the only guests at the resort — a perk of visiting in offseason — and we soon settle into a comfortable rhythm in our little cabin. Each day, we go exploring in the morning; at night we return to cook dinner and watch the sunset from our deck. \nHusavík was once the center of Iceland’s whaling industry. Now it’s the top whale-watching destination in Iceland, for the variety and number of whales in the bay. We book an excursion even though it’s late in the season and our odds of spotting a whale are slim. As our boat makes its way across the bay, I notice a dot of white on the land on the other side. It’s a single tiny house tucked into the mountain’s steep ridges. There is no dock, no road, no visible way for the inhabitant to reach the house. I point it out to the guide and ask if anyone still lives there. \n“It might be a summer house,” he says. “People from the city like to get away from the crowds.” I ask if it ever gets crowded here, with all the tourists coming to see the whales. \n“In summer we get a lot of visitors,” he says, “but most people come for the whales and then move on, or they stay in Akureryi.” Akureryi is Iceland’s second-biggest city — or rather, the only other city aside from the capital, as everything else is considered a town — with a population of 18,000. \nThe whale-watching boats that depart from Husavík can carry as many as 150 people. Today, there are fewer than 30 people in our group, and we’re only able to spot a few lone whales. It seems at this point in the season the whales — like the tourists — have chosen other destinations. \nReykjavik and southwest Iceland get the lion’s share of the country’s tourists, the vast majority of whom come in the short summer. The Blue Lagoon, the most popular attraction in Iceland, is visited by 95 percent of Iceland’s tourists. \nThe nearby Golden Circle route is traveled by more than 600,000 people each year and encompasses a trifecta of the country’s other most-visited attractions: Gullfoss waterfall, Geysir and Thingvellir National Park. In comparison, the top attractions in the north see less than 15 percent of that number. \nThere’s no official tourist route between the main attractions in the north, and unlike on the Golden Circle route, there’s also no line of massive tour buses spewing flag-toting guides at each stop. \nWe start at Godafoss waterfall, which appears seemingly out of nowhere as it plummets off a plain. Its size — a 40-foot drop across a 100-foot span — makes it smaller than Gullfoss, its southern cousin, but no less beautiful. It also appears much wilder, bearing little resemblance to an official tourist attraction; there are no other cars in the unmarked patch of dirt that serves as the parking lot, and not even a flimsy rope keeps clumsy tourists from tumbling into the falls. We pose for photos around the rocky edge, and I get so close to the drop-off that the spray from the thundering water soaks my hair. \nNext we drive around the 2,000-year-old Lake Myvatn, exploring the uninhabited moss-covered lava fields that surround it. Supposedly, the Apollo 11 crew trained for their moon walks here; the story goes that NASA determined that it was the best place on Earth to simulate conditions on the moon. \nWe spend hours alone, climbing along the craggy cliffs and over lava rocks topped by a spongy-soft green blanket of moss, leaving the only footprints to be seen. \nOne afternoon, we walk the 10 minutes from our cabin down the road into Husavík. The only other creatures we pass are a group of horses who amble over to greet us, probably curious about the unseasonable tourists crossing their path. \nWe wander the streets of the tiny town, peering into the windows of the candy-colored aluminum-sided houses that seem so impermanent tucked between mountains and bay, and then order a round of beers at the Gamli Baukur restaurant, lured by its empty patio with a view of the harbor. \nWe sit in the sun and watch the ships: a whale-watching boat carrying two dozen tourists, a few tiny fishing boats and a large whaling ship with its big red and white H painted on top. The tourists get in their cars and drive away, and the fishermen pack up their gear and head home, leaving the harbor silent and still. \nLater we walk slowly back to our cabin, stopping to dip our toes into the frigid North Atlantic and again to pet the horses, to enjoy the sun and the salty breeze, and to revel in the feeling of being completely alone in this quiet corner of Iceland. \nOn our last full day in Husavík, we visit the northern version of the Blue Lagoon, the Myvatn Nature Baths, which, like their southern counterpart, are fed from the runoff of a geothermal power plant. The mineral-rich water is reputed to have healing properties, though unlike at the Blue Lagoon, here there’s no swim-up bar and instead of a fancy restaurant, there’s a self-service cafeteria. \nThe only person inside is the cashier. I ask if it’s always this quiet, if it’s just dead because it’s offseason, or if most people just go to the Blue Lagoon instead. \n“Locals come after work and on weekends, and from June to August we have a lot more tourists,” she says, “but it’s still nothing like the Blue Lagoon. Most people come here to get away from those crowds.” \nI think back to our first trip, when Dan and I visited the Blue Lagoon our first morning in Iceland. It was winter, but the lagoon was packed. I’d been so enthralled by the steaming springs and the snow-dusted moonscape, I’d barely noticed or cared that I had only a few feet of personal space in the teeming lagoon. \nNow Dan and I are the only two people bobbing in the milky neon-blue water of our own private hot springs. We coat our faces in the therapeutic silica that lines the bottom of the springs and soak until the water’s minerals turn my hair to straw. \nHere, as we have throughout our time in northern Iceland, we have the whole place to ourselves. When a German family and a group of three Brits finally join us, we take it as a sign to move on. \nAfter being spoiled by the solitude of Iceland’s wide open spaces, more than eight people almost feels like a crowd. \nKatie Hammel is a San Francisco freelance writer.
