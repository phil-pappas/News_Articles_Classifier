Before, $30 for a book or $100 on a dress didn’t seem like a lot, but now that I’m travelling long term, I wish I could get all those dollars back.”\nSimple and uncluttered. Minimalism is having its day.

After reading about minimalism online, he decided to have a go at throwing out 30 things in 30 days, but ended up culling a lot more.\n“It started with the stuff in my life, but led to other areas, with me questioning the relationships in my life,” he told news.com.au\n“I wasn’t contributing much to the community and showing the people I loved that I loved them.”\nMillburn says the average American household has 300,000 items and after coming to Australia recently, he’s convinced that we’re catching up on the consumerism front.\n“We hold onto so many things ‘just in case’,” he says.\nErin Van Der Meer decided to downsize so she could travel fulltime.

He describes his home now as neat and tidy, and says he dresses in investment pieces that are long-lasting and make him feel good.\n“Now everything I own serves a purpose or brings me joy,” he says.\n“It’s not about depriving myself of things I use, it’s about questioning what adds value to my life and being intentional about what I bring into my life.”\nFor Brooke McAlary, from the Blue Mountains, it was a brutal case of postnatal depression that caused her to reassess her consumerism. As a jewellery designer, she’d put herself under a lot of pressure to look the part, living a jetsetting lifestyle and always dressed to the nines.\nPost-natal depression caused Brooke McAlary to reassess her consumerism.

Now she only owns 32 pieces of clothing.\nBrooke McAlary’s incredibly minimalist wardrobe. She now only owns 32 items of clothing.

It’s when it’s a mindless grab and people hold onto things out of fear or obligation that it starts to become problematic.”\nHow to start living a more minimalist life:\n1. Start small. “Start getting rid of one item a day for 30 days and you get momentum and it becomes more exciting and fun,” Millburn says.\n2. Stop the comparisons. “We buy into this idea of ‘Keeping up with the Joneses,” McAlary says. “Choose to look at things mindfully.”\n3. Ease yourself into the sentimental stuff. “That memory or person or holiday is not actually in the item,” McAlary says. “Once you’re able to remove the emotional attachment you can look at an item as just an item. But it takes time; you can’t rush that.”\n4. Look to the cloud. “Music streaming and Netflix allow us to access movie and music without having to own the physical thing,” Millburn says. “You can also scan photographs and handwritten notes from loved ones, which means they are backed up and protected from something like a flood or fire.”\n5. Don’t stress about other people. “Some [minimalists] stress about people giving them gifts, but I think it’s important to minimise the drama,” McAlary says. “Sometimes you have to do your best, then you kind of let go.”\nThe minimalist dream home.
