So is it worth heading to university or could a shorter course suffice? 1. Starting a coding career Pros: A university course will give you a solid foundation in computer science with an accreditation that carries some real weight, and a diploma certainly helps justify the time and expense of your tertiary education. Cons: Technology is moving so quickly that keeping syllabuses relevant to what the jobs market actually needs is a constant – and often losing – battle. Moreover, choosing a smaller, personal course can help you and your teachers assess whether you have the right kind of brain to make it as a developer. That’s a better option than realising three years and tens of thousand pounds later that though you are fluent in code, web development really isn’t your thing. 2. Selecting an intensive course Pros: An intensive course, such as Makers Academy’s 12-week Coding Bootcamp, helps you learn the basics of coding while encouraging you to learn how to develop yourself and your skills independently. New courses start every six weeks, so you don’t have to wait until September to get cracking. Cons: Independent learning isn’t for everyone. Teaching at Makers quickly transitions from close supervision to almost total self-management, and once you’re accepted on to a course you will need to complete a four-week preparatory course from home before you join. It’s tough, full-time work, and isn’t called a boot camp for nothing, but with the Academy’s affiliated placements, you’re ready to go straight into a junior development role and hit the ground running. 3. Trying a free option Pros: A degree will set you back tens of thousands of pounds plus a career break of at least a year. Even a short course such as Makers will cost £8,000, and you’ll need to fund your life in London for 12 weeks while you study. There are free courses available on the internet to teach you the basics of coding, and they can appear a compelling, if lightweight, alternative. Cons: While a free option may help you learn the basics of code, you won’t gain the same insight of the job of web development without the practice and insight gained through a bona fide paid course. And even if your skills are up to scratch, without an accreditation of some sort – and a hefty chunk of coursework for your portfolio – it’s going to be difficult for an employer to take you on. 4. Join a small team Pros: The average size of a university in the UK is 15,000 to 18,000 students, so class sizes vary massively. You could end up in a small working group but you could also end up getting lost in the crowd. Each Makers Academy course contains a maximum of 30 students for the entire 12-week duration, so you know you’ll get the attention you need from the tutors. And, once the course ends, the Academy’s engaged alumni network and hiring partners make the job hunt a swifter, simpler process. Cons: More people mean more ideas, and a thriving course of dozens of students can really help open your mind to new approaches and sources of inspiration. A good web developer should have an eye on the latest trends, and while they’re to be found online, there’s much to be said for face-time with like-minded individuals. If you do join a small team, make sure you take advantage of networks, socials and alumni schemes to ensure you’re picking up everything you can. 5. Specialise Pros: You’ll leave University with a degree or other official qualification that could put you in the top tier for a general development post, or a specific niche role, depending on your module choices. The approach of a course such as Makers Academy is to teach you just the seed knowledge and skills you need to get started in a career in development and leave the specialisation up to you. Cons: The market moves so quickly that specialising while still in education could mean you miss the next big thing. The Academy has avoided becoming officially certified because it would mean adhering to a governing body’s curriculum, rather than allowing it to tweak the course based on the reality of development right now. A university course that was at the bleeding edge in 2014 is already pretty dated by 2015 – and you don’t want your skills to age that quickly. • Find out more about coding and how to sign up for Makers Academy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:54:38.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
