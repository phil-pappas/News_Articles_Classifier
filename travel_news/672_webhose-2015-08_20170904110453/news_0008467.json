Twelve years ago, she and her husband bought an old holiday cottage in the pretty fishing village of Little Haven, within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Rugged cliffs and a 300-mile coastline – no wonder more than 10,000 Brits call Cornwall their second home Now, four of her five children are in their twenties, but the whole family is preparing for their annual summer gathering in their second home. It’s a site of precious family memories – picnics, boat trips, exam results and New Year celebrations. “It’s great to be able to pass on these traditions,” says Amanda. With five children, a holiday home in the UK seemed the cheapest get-away option for the Giles family. “Flights for all five of us meant our vacations were very pricey,” says Amanda. “There’s enough here to keep the children coming back; they still love it.” Some 165,000 people own holiday homes in England and Wales, according to the latest national census. A recent study* has found that Cornwall, Gwynedd (north-west Wales) and Norfolk are where most people buy. Amanda and her husband Ed live in Northamptonshire but make the four-and-a-half-hour trip down to spend about seven weeks a year in Wales. They took on a second mortgage to buy the property after spending holidays in Pembrokeshire since their children were tiny. “There’s a real community,” says Amanda. “The children have made their own friends separate from their daily lives. It’s a home away from home.” Home to Snowdonia National Park, the Welsh area of Gwynedd is the favourite choice for more than 7,000 holiday makers Buyers of second homes face a range of funding choices, with remortgaging their existing property being the most common option. “Some people, when they approach retirement and come close to paying off a mortgage, might look at investing in a second home, inspired by holidays or a yearning to explore the countryside,” says Jonathan Gale, who has worked as a Barclays Mortgage Advisor for 11 years. Home buyers taking out a mortgage for a second property will, typically, need to provide a 20 per cent deposit. “People don’t always choose the cheapest option, though,” says Jonathan. “They might not want to remortgage a property they’ve spent the last 30 years paying off and will often take out a mortgage on just the new property.” Jonathan says the first step when buying a second home is to seek independent advice on any tax implications and the variety of funding options that might be suitable for you. “Second-home buyers often have enough equity in their first property, so by remortgaging and releasing that equity they become cash buyers,” he says. “Or they can often get cheaper rates by borrowing a lower amount against each property.” The lower the amount you borrow versus the property value usually means lower interest rates. Popular for its sandy beaches and salt marshes, north Norfolk has almost 5,000 holiday homes and counting “As with any mortgage, you need to ensure you can maintain payments throughout the term, as your property could be at risk if you don’t,” adds Jonathan. “At Barclays, we can advise on the most cost-efficient and best mortgage for you.” For the Giles family, a second home has proved its worth. “Sometimes it rains, sometimes we never get to that picnic,” says Amanda. “But this is absolutely the best decision we ever made.” • To speak to a Mortgage Advisor, visit your local Barclays branch or go to barclays.co.uk/mortgages » YOUR VIEWS The Telegraph asked holiday-home owners: What do you love about having a bolthole in the countryside? Annie Price, Winchester Annie, 58, lives with her husband in west London and Winchester. “We live wherever suits our needs. I’m a London girl and I love the anonymity of the city. In Winchester, more people know your business, but I love the diversity of things. Sam Johnson, North Devon Sam, 49, bought a cottage in north Devon, where she spends weekends away from her london home with her teenage son. “I love being able to live in a parallel universe. We pop out and within an hour we’re eating fish and chips, looking out to the dunes, pretending this is our everyday life.” INSIDER VIEW Dominic Subbiani, Director, FBM estate agents, Pembrokeshire Ask yourself: “What do we want this property to do for us?” Are you looking for a property to utilise with family and friends, or for a long-term investment with a good rate of return? Consultation of local agents is vital, because they are the ones who know the market in their area the best. Rosie Murray-West, Financial journalist Before buying a holiday home, have a talk with a financial planner, so you are aware of all the costs involved. As well as your mortgage repayments, you will need to think about bills, council tax and any additional payments, such as employing a local housekeeper to keep an eye on the property. Jonathan Gale, Barclays Mortgage Advisor Look around and you may be pleasantly surprised. A second home might be more affordable than you think. But do your homework and seek advice from someone qualified to help. Your local Barclays Mortgage Advisor is always happy to chat. The biggest mistake people make is not doing their sums in the first place. Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage. The options outlined above should not be regarded as advice, and terms, conditions and exclusions will apply for all mortgages. *research conducted by the insurer Direct Line, May 2015 You may also be interested in: • Join the mobile cheque movement • Online security: how to feel safe, not sorry • How banking technology transforms your world", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T14:49:56.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
