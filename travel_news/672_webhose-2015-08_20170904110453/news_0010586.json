Smaller than the commercial, tasteless variety, these are grown in the volcanic soils of Lake Nemi, just below the village. \nBut the Nemi's lake isn't just a pretty, volcanic lake. Called \"Speculum Dianae\" or the \"Mirror of Diana\" since Roman times, the fertility cults of the time led expectant mothers to bathe in the lake to ensure a healthy childbirth. Evidently, the lake's high levels of Magnesium are good for mothers ( Fertile History of Nemi ). \nThere is another secret to Nemi. Roman emperor Caligula had two giant boats built for the lake. Mussolini called upon Guido Ucelli to empty the lake and dredge up the remains of the boats, then built a museum for them. Unfortunately during the war, retreating Germans, it is said, set fire to the boats. The museum holds artifacts and some rebuilt pieces from these luxurious ships. \nYou may wish to stay in Nemi; it has a many shops selling a wide variety of salumi and versions of the porchetta made famous by its neighbor Ariccia.
