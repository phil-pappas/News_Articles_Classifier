Mancham, founding President of the Republic of Seychelles, raised the question of the European Union (EU) flagged-vessels allegedly involved in Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the waters of African countries. \nYesterday (4th August), Ms Lowri Evans, Director-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of the European Commission in Brussels has responded to Sir James’s comments on the issue in a letter to him on the subject. \n“Dear Mr Mancham, \nFollowing up on your statements made at the World Ocean Summit in June 2015 regarding EU-flagged vessels allegedly involved in IUU fishing in the waters of African countries, I would like to inform you about the state of play in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing which is of paramount importance for the European Union. \nThe European Union has put in force in 2010 a specific legal instrument to fight IUU \nfishing, the Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 (the IUU Regulation). The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, makes an intensive use of the numerous tools established by the IUU Regulation, such as the EU catch certificate scheme (which allows for the proper traceability of fisheries products from ‘net’ to ‘plate’), the EU system of mutual assistance, the cooperation with third countries in the fight against IUU fishing and the list of IUU vessels. The work of the Commission has brought concrete positive results in the fight against IUU fishing. \nSince 2010 the European Commission has investigated more than 200 cases of presumed \nIUU fishing by vessels from 27 countries including European ones. As a direct \nconsequence of these actions, 8 flag States and 4 coastal States have imposed sanctions \nagainst more than 50 vessels for a total amount of roughly 8 million of euros. Following \non from these results, the Commission continues its efforts and is closely cooperating \nwith Member States and third countries circulating information and requesting actions for cases of presumed IUU fishing activities of vessels. To date more than 180 alert messages were sent from the Commission to Member States \nauthorities to help them target their controls, cope with risk situations and request \ninvestigations on presumed IUU fishing activities and serious infringements. \nAs a direct consequence of the firm determination of the European Union and its Member \nStates to tackle IUU fishing activities and of the exchange of information between \nauthorities, an increasing number of imports to the European market are being rejected by Member States. The Commission is also cooperating with almost 50 third countries on \nissues concerning compliance of countries with international law rules for flag, coastal, \nport or market States. \nThe European Commission is cooperating closely with third countries on the \nimplementation of the EU catch certification scheme and measures against IUU fishing. \nMore than 55 developing countries have received technical assistance from the European \nUnion through two programmes: ACP Fish II (30 million euros) and Environment and \nSustainable Management of Natural Resources including Energy (ENRTP) amounting to \n2 million euros. Third countries can also prioritize fisheries and the fight against IUU \nfishing in the programmes financed by the European Commission’s Directorate-General \nfor International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO). \nThe European Union uses all bilateral and multilateral channels to render IUU fishing a \nless lucrative business including through our work in Regional Fisheries Management \nOrganisations (RFMOs). The European Union has been promoting the ratification of the \n2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing to allow for its entry into force. The European \nUnion will also continue to technically and financially support the establishment of a \nGlobal Register for Fishing Vessels which should also contribute to the fight against \nIUU. \nThe European Union and its 28 Member States are parties to the United Nations Fish \nStocks Agreement (UNFSA). We hope that the UNFSA Review Conference which will \nbe held next year will help us improve the implementation of its provisions and enable \nother states to become a party. This is necessary to ensure that we can be successful in \ntackling remaining challenges such as the poor state of some fish stocks, fishing \novercapacity, IUU fishing, diminishing ecosystem impacts of fisheries and improving \ncompliance in order to achieve the sustainable development of oceans and their resources for the global benefit. \nThe European Union vessels, which are closely monitored by Member States, have very \nstrong incentives to refrain from engaging in IUU fishing or related activities. Should you have any evidence of EU-flagged vessels engaging in such activities, we kindly invite you to submit any information you might have in order to investigate and act decisively \nagainst any wrongdoings. The European Commission is looking forward to working with you on issues related to \ninternational oceans governance. We would encourage you to respond to the consultation \non international oceans governance recently launched by Commissioner Velia. The \ndetails of the consultation can be found here: \nYours sincerely, Lowri Evans .” \nIn a statement issued this morning from the Island of Majorca, Spain, where Sir James is enjoying a short summer vacation from his international commitments, the Seychelles’ international statesman said that he welcome and appreciate the response he has received from the European Commission concerning the issue of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing. \nSir James said that by the law of average, the European Union is playing a leading and important role in ensuring the survival of sustainable fishing in the global interest. He said that despite all internal problems of a financial nature like the Greek tragedy, Brussels has remained steadfast in keeping on line with its international obligations. That is why he personally believes that the European Union must maintain its cohesion in the global interest. \nSir James said that more young Africans should be made attracted to become qualified fishermen to reap the benefits of their rich coastal and beyond fishing potential instead of braving the waves of seas around them and become pirates – or to leave behind their potentially rich country and aim to cross the Mediterraneans as illegal immigrants because of the false notion that the streets of European cities are paved with gold.
