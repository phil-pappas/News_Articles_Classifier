Published on : Thursday, August 13, 2015\nAs Mark Beaumont gears up for his epic journey on Monday morning to cycle the North Coast 500, non-stop and against the clock, VisitScotland Chief Executive Malcolm Roughead wishes him good luck.\nMalcolm Roughead, Chief Executive of VisitScotland said:\n“The North Coast 500 has already been named as one of the best coastal road trips in the world and will no doubt become a haven for cyclists, thanks in no small part to Mark’s enthusiasm. This particular route winds through some of the most picturesque parts of our beautiful country and is an important part of the visitor economy to the area.\n“Road cycling is hugely popular with visitors to Scotland, with more and more getting on their bike and exploring the spectacular scenery on our doorstep. Last year cycling trips by domestic visitors brought in £78 million to the national economy.\n“Good luck Mark. We hope many more will follow your lead and take in this wonderful part of the world – albeit at a more leisurely pace!”\nSource:-Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:20:33.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
