As I have posted before, my wife is a dual Romanian and Hungarian national. But since we live in Germany, we wanted to apply for her OCI card here at the Indian Consulate in Hamburg. After several emails exchanged with them, and a few phone calls, we were able to identify the exact documentation needed. One thing to note is that the consulate advised us that we should apply with, and mention, only the nationality/passport that she will use for travel. So in our case we are using the Romanian passport and information about the Hungarian passport was completely left out. We got married in Denmark, so this obviously also complicated things a little bit for us. Please note that a marriage must have subsisted for at least 2-years before you can apply for the OCI card. We were also told that you must have resided, and be currently residing, together. In any case, besides the completely filled out A and B sections of the OCI application self-attested copies of the following documents were submitted via post: Copy of Romanian passport for spouse. Spouse's Meldebestätigung -- we were required to show a residence period of at least one year. We have lived here several years, but moved last year, so we submitted our current and previous ones. Birth certificate -- issued in Romania and apostilled. Marriage certificate -- issued in Denmark. This needs to be apostilled and also legalized by the Indian Embassy in Copenhagen. Name change certificate -- since my wife has adopted my last name, we were asked to submit a certificate confirming that she legally changed her name. This one was a bit difficult since there is no such certificate issued by the Romanian officials. So after discussing it with the Consulate staff we have submitted our marriage registration certificate from Romania as proof of name change since it contains her old and new names. This is also the same certificate that was used to obtain her new Romanian passport. This one might get tricky because it is not legalized by the Indian Embassy in Bucharest, and it was suggested by the consulate in Hamburg that they might need this done. But they said they will let us know after receipt of application if it is required. Spouse' Indian passport -- first page of the Indian spouse' currently valid passport. Aufenthaltskarte -- currently valid Aufthaltskarte issued to the Indian spouse. No objection certificate (NOC) -- this has to be issued by the Indian spouse to confirm that he/she does not have any objections towards an OCI card being issued to the non-Indian national spouse. Marriage and residence information -- a statement providing all the details regarding the marriage and information about both spouses' joint residence since marriage, which should be currently so as well. OCI undertaking -- this is a joint declaration that needs to be made by both spouse's regarding their confirmation of understanding the rules related to surrendering and OCI card in case of separation/divorce. All these documents had to be submitted in duplicate . A fee of €281 was sent in cash along with the application. If you wish to receive a receipt for the submitted application and money, you must write one out yourself and include it in the application packet. Along with this, a stamped self-addressed envelope needs to included for return of this receipt as well. It took exactly 10 days from the date of delivery for the application to get registered in the online OCI status tracking. The consulate was actually kind enough to call and let us know that the application was received and is now being processed. When tracking the application online, we see the following status now: Applicant Name: <name>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T05:46:32.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
