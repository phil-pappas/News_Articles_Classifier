Phoebe, 11, spits out her mouthful of tripe into a napkin. “It tastes like bogeys,” she says, before her face brightens. “There he is. Look, Daddy!” She points over my wife’s head to the rooftop terrace at the wedding cake-like Hotel ME Madrid. Leaving our room at the hotel earlier, we’d bumped into will.i.am, the pop megastar, with his entourage by the lifts. The kids and I have been in high excitement ever since. Celebrity promise: Can the lure of will.i.am convince the Hatch family to emprace exotic tapas in Madrid? Photo: Rii Schroer My wife moves her chair to block our view. “I don’t think it’s him,” I say, zooming in on my camera. “will.i.am was wearing a felt hat. That man’s looks leather.” “Ben!” scolds my wife. “Can we try to remember why we’re here?” My wife has decided that this Spanish holiday is the perfect opportunity to expand our culinary horizons – specifically mine and my daughter’s. She hands me a forkful of the tripe and tells me the orange sauce is delicious. • How to survive a family trip to the zoo • Flying with children: 10 secrets to stress-free travel • How to survive a long car journey with children My mother never let food go to waste. Anything uneaten was recycled in subsequent meals. A slice of yesterday’s tinned peach could easily emerge from a mound of mashed potato the following day. Once I found spaghetti hoops in a roast chicken. When I was old enough to eat what I wanted, I opted for the same meal, twice a day, for a decade: peanuts, a KitKat and cheese, eaten in a strict but glorious rotation. This indulgence, coupled with another involving Burger King’s Chicken Royale, has compromised my taste buds to such a degree that I now don’t eat fish or pasta. I can’t abide lamb, eggs, cooked vegetables, casseroles, cream and much more besides. My dietary peccadilloes also have contributed to me contracting the bowel disease diverticulitis. My wife blames my mother – and me – for our daughter’s increasingly fussy eating. While Ben Hatch eyes tripe with suspicion, his dietary peccadilloes seem not to include an aversion to Black Eyed Peas Photo: Ben Hatch The mouthful of tripe slides accidentally and repulsively down my throat like a greased tray down a water slide. “Pathetic,” says my wife, as I slug from the glass of water my daughter passes. “I’m trying to help you. Do you want another bout of diver?” On the next silver tray is something as luminous as the moon and scarily hollow like a dead tulip. “Baby cuttlefish,” says my wife. “You’re lucky. I was going to order the oreja – that’s pig ears. If you try it Phoebe, Daddy will knock on will.i.am’s door and ask for his autograph. Won’t you?” • Skip the kids' club: why families need proper holidays • Why is renewing a child's passport so difficult? • How Bear Grylls ruined my family holiday The cuttlefish tastes of old rubber bands and both my daughter and I gag, but the next few dishes aren’t so extreme. We try gazpacho, crabsticks, and a leek-and-cheese sandwich, which we both have to admit is OK. Finally my wife rewards us with ham, ketchup and chips – although it’s served in a cube, like it’s been mixed in a blender. In the hotel, still hungry, I hover beside a room service trolley outside will.i.am’s suite while my wife settles the kids. I hear his nasal voice through the door: “So all I got to do is retweet?” I’m about to knock when I notice on his trolley a saucer of orange peel twists coated in chocolate, and triangles of what looks like Manchego. will.i.am can wait. Now it's time to take sides: are holidays the right time to try exotic foods? Or should you follow Ben Hatch's instinct and stick to a familiar ham and chips? Let us know in the comments below.
