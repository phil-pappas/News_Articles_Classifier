And that they’re very tightly networked,” Cohen said. “Travel agents are very collegial and supportive of one another. \n“I was used to being in a very competitive environment with other firms to get jobs, but because the travel industry is relationship based you’re not really competing with anybody else for a specific piece of work.” \nThe other thing that surprised her is how hard the travel business is and how difficult it can be to create a really great booking. \n“The amount of precision and detail that goes into each of these bookings is amazing. You’ve got to get it right and to be available around the clock,” she said. \nIn spite of the hard work, the rewards for Cohen are many. \n“I’m very passionate about travel and authentic experiences,” she said. Asia, especially Japan, is her favorite place to have those experiences. \n“It’s very spiritual,” she said. “We went up to Koya-san (Mt. Koya) and lived with the monks for a few days. I also love the onsens (hot springs).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T04:52:53.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
