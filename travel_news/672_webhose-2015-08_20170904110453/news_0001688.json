He looks out onto a tangerine orange plain, with rocky seams of rugged mountain and crag. \nTheeb – Wolf – is learning the ways of the Bedouin, which includes brotherhood and never refusing a guest. He and his recently orphaned brother Hussein (Hussein Salameh) are from a family of pilgrim guides, and they cannot refuse to lead a British soldier and his Arab guide, who are crossing this land as the Ottoman Empire crumbles to its end in 1916. \nTheeb is told not to follow, but disobeys, and starts a journey across this apparently harsh terrain. \n• Jordan travel guide \nDirector Naji Abu Nowar, who is British and Jordanian, spent a year living with the Bedouin, who make up the film’s cast and crew, for a year before he starting shooting. He gained their trust, learned their customers and to appreciate their manner of existence. \nThe landscapes – exploited by the Jordan tourist board nearly as much as the rock-cut city of Petra when it comes to promoting the country – seem harsh and hostile to outsiders. \n“But it’s a wellspring of life to the Bedouin”, said Mr Nowar. “When I was there I saw wildlife I would never have spotted without them, including oryx. For westerners it’s barren, it is full and rich of life – but you need their skills and you don’t want to go off alone there.” \nWadi Rum, a Unesco World Heritage Site covering 74,000 hectares of southern Jordan, was integral to telling Theeb’s story as he travelled through what was then Hejaz Province. We see sandstone and granite rock formations, the dagger-like passages through the rock and the sandy wadi floor from his point of view. “Wadi Rum is a forest for Theeb: he is in a maze and you never see a 360 view once he starts his journey,” Mr Nowar notes. \nToday, the Wadi Rum area is inhabited by Zalabia and Zuwaydeh bedouin tribes, Rum village itself mostly lived in by the former. According to Jordan historian Ruth Caswell, important Zalabia tribesmen were given a personal gift of a house and some surrounding land by King Hussein, who ruled from 1952-1999, to encourage the communities to settle. \nMuch of the film Lawrence of Arabia was shot here in the early Sixties, causing the first wave of cinema-inspired tourism from foreigners arriving to visit the shooting location. \nMany of the Bedouin now make a living from the tourism industry, qualified as professional guides. They know Wadi Rum’s crags, dips, hollows and plains better than any external guide. “They cannot go back to their old ways, you can’t go back 100 years,” Mr Nowar said. He added that the film has helped diversify sources of income in the area, however, so that local people are not so reliant on tourism. “Some of the Bedouin [who acted in Theeb] have appeared in other films and the women who worked to make props such as water bags are being hired as skilled crew,” he said. \nStill, Mr Nowar hopes that Theeb will encourage tourists to return, who have been put off in their thousands by the conflict in countries surrounding Jordan despite the fact that the Foreign Office considers the vast majority of the country safe, save a thin strip near the Syrian border. \n“It has been hit very badly and unfairly – Jordan is extremely safe but people lump the Middle East into one bag. What’s sad is that the areas around Wadi Rum and Jordan are the safest, but no tourists are going. I hope people see the film and that it encourages them to return.” \nPhotos by Nasser Kalaji; stills from print by Wolfgang Thaler. Theeb is in UK cinemas from August 14.
