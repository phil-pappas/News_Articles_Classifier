The Eden Resort & Suites continues to promise excellence at every turn with 301 well-appointed rooms and suites, two award-winning restaurants , a modern cocktail lounge, indoor and outdoor pools, an outdoor recreation complex and a newly expanded and enhanced fitness center. This latest round of enhancements will continue the tradition of winter season innovative improvements designed to bring guests the very best in accommodations year round. The Eden Resort & Suites has invested more than $50 million over the past 15 years and that investment will grow this year, as the latest enhancements will include all 51 redesigned guest rooms plus a new elevator and a beautiful and functional porte cochere complete with extensive exterior landscaping and a charming new façade.\nMark Clossey, Eden Resort & Suites General Manager had this to say about the renovations, “We’re excited to begin this project. We have years of experience listening to what our guests want and need and we believe we are designing the perfect combination - an ideal corporate traveler guest room as well as a luxurious room perfect for a couple’s weekend retreat.”\nThe redesign will include second and third floor “adults only” rooms designated for the exclusive use of those 18 years old and above. The rooms will feature luxurious king beds and will offer opulent work and living spaces complete with state-of-the-art electronics desired by today’s business travelers and adults getting away from it all. In addition, these rooms will offer spacious and striking tiled walk-in showers. On the first floor, rooms will be designed with two lavish queen beds, plus modern electronics in the work and living areas. First floor baths will offer the convenience of bath/shower combinations ideally suited for family and group travel. The renovations will begin in early winter and be completed in time for Spring 2016 guests.\n“Plans are nearing completion for a revitalization of the entire “West End” of the Eden Resort. The area we affectionately call the “Regency Terrace” consists of 51 guest rooms, a private elevator and a separate private entrance away from the main Resort entrance. Some of our guests prefer this wing because it’s a little further away from the leisure recreational amenities offered. As a result the entire three-story wing is quieter and is located close to what business travelers seek - the Resort’s restaurants and lounge, meeting spaces and plenty of free parking.” Stephen Sikking, Managing Partner Sales & Marketing, Eden Resort & Suites\nCall today and book a Fall visit now and a return trip in Spring for a stay in the soon to be redesigned Regency Terrace guest rooms at the Eden Resort & Suites!\nCall or visit online at EdenResort.com and reserve your favorite luxury guest room or suite at the Eden Resort & Suites - A Best Western Premier Hotel.
