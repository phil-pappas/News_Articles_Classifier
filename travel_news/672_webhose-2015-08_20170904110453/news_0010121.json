Wakefield Brewing in the Wynwood arts district. As part of the national Four Seasons Undercovercampaign, attendees were not provided with any information regarding the location, menu and any other surprises prior to the event.\nLeading up to the brunch, clues were unveiled on the social media channels of Four Seasons Hotel Miami andEDGE, Steak & Bar. On Friday, August 21 at 5:00 pm, attendees received a special video message from Executive Chef Aaron Brooks of EDGE, Steak & Bar. In the message Chef Aaron is casually enjoying a local beer by brewmaster Jonathan Wakefield, before revealing the location of the undercover event taking place at one of the newest breweries in Wynwood, J. Wakefield Brewing.\nUnaware of what to expect, guests arrived on Sunday to see Chef Aaron roasting a whole lamb on an asador a la cruz , a Latin-style grill, just outside of the craft beer brewery. Once inside, they were welcomed by Wakefield himself, who presented them with a flute of Campos de Fresas Beermosa, sparkling wine poured with one of their strawberry-infused beers. After a short reception inside the bar, boasting floor-to-ceiling murals of Star Wars characters and comic book lithographs, attendees were escorted for a behind-the-scenes tour of the brewery. Amid the tanks, they learned about the elements of creating a quality craft beer, and their newest concoction – Bourbon Barrel Aged Maple Syrup.\nFollowing the tour, guests were seated and ready to enjoy the five-course beer-paired brunch. EDGE has been named as having one of the Best Brunch Buffets in America by Travel + Leisure , so Chef Aaron wanted to create a new Sunday Brunch experience as the focus for the Miami edition of Four Seasons Undercover. The menu was infused with flavours from Miami, Chef Aaron’s Aussie background and new BBQ favourites all centred on a craft beer experience with J. Wakefield brews. From the local mangos in the malted barley oatmeal to the shrimp on the barbie, house made fennel sausage, Australian lamb and even the BBQ’d Bananas for dessert, each dish was served straight off the grill.\nFour Seasons Undercover Beer & Brunch Menu\nRoasted local mangos, malted barley oatmeal, whipped honey butter\nServed with Kottbusser\nShrimp on the barbie, soft cooked Lake Meadow egg, charred tomato salsa, avocado\nServed with Raspberry Lemonade Radler Stush\nFranks and beans, house made fennel sausage, gigante bean salad, grilled kale pesto\nServed with Hop for Teacher IPA (a deep orange India pale ale infused with citrus and tropical fruits, well-balanced intricacies followed by a solid malt backbone)\nCoal-fired Australian lamb, golden raisin and olive chimichurri, sesame yoghurt, fire-roasted pistachios, charred beets and onions\nServed with Dopplebock\nBBQ’d banana sundae, toasted peanut ice cream, chocolate stout fudge sauce, topped with Bourbon Barrel Aged Maple Syrup from J.
