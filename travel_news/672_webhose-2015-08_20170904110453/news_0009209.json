The gathering was called for Republic management to present what it has labeled its \"last, best and final\" contract offer to the 2,200 Republic pilots who comprise Local 357. But then, as soon as the meeting ended — for reasons yet to be made entirely clear — Republic Airways immediately circumvented normal protocol in such contract negotiations and circulated the proposed contract late yesterday directly to Local 357 rank and file membership. The largest number of Republic pilots, 350, are domiciled in Chicago, where Republic (NASDAQ: RJET) operates regional flights for three major carriers — United Airlines (NYSE: UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL). In an interview this morning, Local 357 president Jim Clark said he was surprised by the airline's move to distribute the tentative contract yesterday. Normally, any proposed contract is distributed to union rank and file by union leaders, not by airline management. By way of answering why Republic did what it did, a Republic Airways spokesman this afternoon pointed to a statement posted at a new website dedicated to the airline's last, best and final offer: \"The negotiations between the Company and the IBT have — at times — been productive, (but) they have stalled and have sometimes moved us away from agreement. What they have not been, however, is successful.\" But Republic, as the airline said it would, has posted the entire proposed contract , running well in excess of 100 pages, at the new website. And as Clark and other Republic pilot sources indicated yesterday, the devil — or what may ultimately be the good news — is going to be in the minutiae of what is in the proposed contract. The detail is considerable. Clark himself said this morning he has not had nearly enough time yet to closely read through the latest proposed contract in its entirety and draw any conclusions about whether it substantially improves on a comprehensive proposal he saw in early June. One key section of the latest proposal — compensation — runs nine pages. And compensation is one area Local 357 will be mulling long and hard. Clark today did offer some comparisons between what a Republic captain, in his first year of service, got in 2007, the final year of the current amendable contract, versus what he or she would earn per hour under the proposed contract. For example, a new Republic captain manning smaller airplanes, including the Embraer-140 and -145 aircraft, would have earned base pay of $55.74 per hour in his or her first year of service in 2007, when Local 357's current contract became amendable. The comparable base compensation in the proposed new contract is $67.04 per hour. Clark declined to speculate whether the pay numbers in the proposed contract are sufficient to get the contract ratified by his rank and file. But Clark said the contract almost certainly will be formally presented to Local 357 rank and file pilots for a vote by late next week. Rank and file also will be provided the outcome of a vote by the seven-person Local 357 executive board on whether they think the tentative contract should be ratified. Republic Airways stock was down 19 cents a share to $3.41per share in afternoon trading today. \nGet Chicago  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:55:31.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
