The trio treated guests to a memorable and intimate evening, sharing their expert kitchen tips.\nHaving worked in various kitchens around the world, Miguel Maestre is famous for opening the largest Spanish restaurant in Australia, ‘El Toro Loco’ and is a regular on TV shows such as TEN’s The Living Room, Boys Weekend, and Miguel’s Feasts.

His co-host Alastair McLeod also holds a wealth of experience including Michelin-listed, high profile and fine dining restaurants across the world. Alastair is passionate supporter of all things local, believing the closer you are to the source of your food the better it will taste and the smaller the carbon footprint you will create. This philosophy is shared by the chefs at PARKROYAL Parramatta where ‘market to table’ dishes are sourced locally with a focus on simple dishes with star ingredients packed full of flavour.\nAs Alastair took the reins of hosting the evening, Miguel and Gary headed up two teams, with guests Shelley McQueen (LG) and Robyn Retallick (Hanson) picked out from the crowd.

Similar to the theme of Ready, Steady Cook, the teams then took action, preparing the dishes in the live cooking area whilst guiding guests through their time sensitive creations. Team one stunned with seared tuna with a fennel slaw and chimichurri, whilst team two amazed with a perfectly charred beef fillet with quinoa, asparagus, king brown mushroom and rosemary jus. Judges Amy La Cioppa and Emma Cosgrove were also pulled out from the crowd and asked to give feedback on the creations.
