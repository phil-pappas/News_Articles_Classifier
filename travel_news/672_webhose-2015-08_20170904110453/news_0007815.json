They haven't drawn a conclusion.\" \n\"How can you jump to the conclusion that the plane has crashed simply on the basis of a single piece of debris? It could be pulled from other aircraft,\" he told AFP. \nOn a social media group other relatives expressed similar sentiments, saying: \"Donâ€™t believe them! They must have switched the debris! We do believe all our relatives will come back safe and sound!\" \nThere was a heavy police presence outside the airline's office to greet the relatives, who say they have faced repeated harassment from state security. \nElsewhere Chinese people took to social media sites to express scepticism about Malaysia, whose reputation has taken a knock in China for its handling of the incident. \n\"Malaysia wanted to avoid the large amount of payment for the relatives so it announced that it found the debris in Reunion and that the airplane crashed accidentally. We don't believe Malaysia,\" one comment on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo read.
