Guests will be able to rent a tablet preloaded with movies and television shows . The rental price is $6.99-8.04. Live seatback television, inflight movies and shows \nWestJet is pleased to offer live satellite seatback television provided by Bell TV on some of our Boeing 737 flights within Canada.

Earbuds \nEarbuds are available for purchase on all flights that offer inflight entertainment options. They’re yours to keep, so you can use them on all your WestJet flights (they’re also compatible with all your other gadgets). If you have your own earbuds, bring them along. All 3.5 mm (approximately 1/8 in) stereo headphone connections (with one prong) will work with our systems. Travelling with WestJet Encore \nAs our WestJet Encore turboprop aircraft are not equipped with an inflight entertainment system, we recommend bringing books, magazines, portable DVD players/tablets for yourself and some toys for your little WestJetters. Just remember your carry-on allowance is limited. You can also enjoy WestJet Magazine – our inflight magazine – available in the seatback pockets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T17:47:03.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
