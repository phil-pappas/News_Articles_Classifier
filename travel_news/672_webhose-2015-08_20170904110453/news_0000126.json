By sharing personal images of Mr. Armani on vacation, Giorgio Armani is working to establish a more intimate connection with its consumers. \nIsland escape Mr. Armani regularly spends his summers on the island of Pantelleria, where he has owned a vacation home for more than 30 years. The island is located in the Mediterranean Sea, halfway between Sicily and Tunisia. \nMr. Armani relaxes by his pool at home \nIt is known for its rustic aesthetic, as it is almost impossible to get Internet access on the island, and its caper berries, which have been said to be the best in the world. Visitors to Pantelleria can enjoy the island’s natural beauty, along with archaeological sites from the Bronze Age and ruins from bombings during World War II. \nOn Facebook, Armani shared 11 photos of its creative director enjoying his holiday vacation. Mr. Armani poses for a picture with Italian actress Claudia Cardinale and alone in front of his pool. \nThe private vacation home in Pantelleria \nOther images show Mr. Armani riding motorbikes with his friends and reading a book on his porch. The vacation home itself is also highlighted with its rugged cliffhanging location, sleek interior design and beautiful view of the ocean. \nMr. Armani has always been a popular figure, and his life has inspired some curiosity. For example, his fashion label is the subject of a new film by British GQ magazine, which explores the designer’s life and work and the brand he has created over the past 40 years. \nMr. Armani reads a book on his porch \nTitled “Bravo Giorgio,” the film will feature a number of celebrities and Armani fans, including director Martin Scorcese, actors Dylan McDermott and Benicio Del Torro, singer Tony Bennett and more as they discuss why they love Mr. Armani and how his designs have affected their lives. The video celebrates Armani’s influence in Hollywood and around the world, marking its significance as one of the most iconic luxury brands today ( see story ). \nThe sun sets next to the pool in Pantelleria \nSharing is caring Media like documentaries or biographies can give consumers a more intimate portrayal of their favorite designers, but social media is particularly able to elicit feelings of friendship. \nWhile these images of Mr. Armani were shared by the brand itself, the question of what role the personal lives of designers should play has become more significant in recent years. As luxury houses are becoming more active on social media, so are their creative directors, many of whom have established their own accounts separate from their brands, featuring a mix of personal and professional content. \nThe social media profiles of fashion brands are carefully orchestrated to portray a certain image, which may or may not be upheld by their creative heads as they post on their own. As luxury labels are crafting their online personas, how much of a role should these designer accounts play?
