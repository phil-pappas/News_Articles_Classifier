With its glorious paths around the Schwarza, one of the loveliest mountain rivers in Germany, it combines the heights of the Rennsteig trail with the castle scenery of the Saale river.\nTo make the experience all the more special, you might like to take a ride on the Oberweissbach mountain railway. The refurbished train, which is under historic preservation, connects the Schwarza valley railway with the plateau around Oberweissbach and, with a 25 per cent gradient, is the steepest cable railway of its kind anywhere in the world. While on board, you can enjoy magnificent panoramic views of the Thuringian Forest.\nSource: GNTB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:59:27.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
