As a rule, I don't like restaurants in hotels. If they are in grand hotels, they are usually far too grand for most people. If not they are geared to serving transient customers with unimaginative and mediocre fare. \nThe Galvin brothers, Chris and Jeff, whose small restaurant group has already collected a couple of Michelin stars in London, have avoided those pitfalls in creating their Edinburgh brasserie. Even though it's located in the Waldorf Astoria Caledonian Hotel and the entrance involves crossing lobbies paved with acres of marble under glittering chandeliers, there is no oppressive grandeur here. Ambiance and Decor \nBlue, button-tufted banquettes rest against white walls (tiled below, painted above) or enclose generous booths. Tables are bare, dark polished wood. There are plenty of Thonet-style bentwood chairs and coat trees - almost a signature of Parisian brasseries . There's also seating at a champagne bar and a showcase displaying shellfish and crustaceans on ice - perhaps less bountiful than I expected but it was a quiet weeknight. Professional and impeccable waiters make the whole experience comfortable and relaxed. I just have one suggestion if you plan to dine here - pick a time when the restaurant is likely to be full - late night perhaps or Sunday lunch. The room cries out for a lively buzz. When it is relatively quiet, it can seem cavernous. The Menu \nLocal Scottish ingredients - fish and shellfish, Galloway beef, raspberries in season, even haggis - feature on a menu of familiar French and British dishes along with more exotic dishes. \nThe cosmopolitan starters include escargots á la Bourguignone (snails in garlic butter and red wine), the Middle Eastern eggplant dish imam bayeldi, gazpacho Andaluz, terrines, smoked salmon, haggis and charcuterie. \nLobster, Orkney scallops , oysters, langoustines, crab and Shetland mussels star on the crustacea menu. A grand Scottish seafood platter for £74.50 (at 2015 prices) cries out for a great champagne celebration. \nThere's a good selection of grills - steaks, burgers, fish and shellfish, and main courses ranging from duck breast, cod and plaice to lamb pastilla - a Moroccan meat pie - with couscous. \nVegetarians will struggle here. The menu included only one or two vegetarian starters and one vegetarian main. \nI chose half a grilled lobster with garlic butter accompanied by crisp, green beans. It was delicious and tender though, perhaps, a little too fussed with for me. The only silly pretension - the lobster came with all the implements needed for a whole boiled lobster - nutcracker, lobster picks, the lot. But the poor creature had already been removed from its shell, chopped into chunks, mixed with other ingredients and piled back into its shell so all those tools were unnecessary. \nI could not fault dessert, a heavenly blueberry soufflé with toasted almond ice cream , truly one of the best desserts I've eaten in years Good Food at Affordable Prices \nIn 2013, Michelin gave the Galvin Brasserie de Luxe in Edinburgh a Bib Gourmand, an award for good food at affordable prices. You could splash a lot of money for a giant seafood platter but a three course menu with wine can be had for about £35 per person, and the plat du jour is usually a pretty special dish for £20 or less. When I visited, Bouillabaisse Marseillaise was the dish of the day for only £19 . The prix fixe menu, available at lunch and dinner, cost £16 for two courses and £19 for three in 2015. That menu changes frequently but you can count on real brasserie classics like saucisson, coq au vin and crème caramel. Not Exactly a Brasserie \nAt the start of this review I said that the Galvin Brasserie de Luxe was an \"almost authentic\" experience. The main difference is that it keeps typically British hours, closing after lunch and relatively early after dinner, while in Paris, brasseries are open continuously, from early until very late. Otherwise, close your eyes and you could be in Paris. Essentials Where : Galvin Brasserie de Luxe, Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian, Rutland Street, Edinburgh, EH1 2AB.
