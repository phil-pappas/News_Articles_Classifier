A number of flights from the Northeast airports in the United States were delayed or cancelled.\nAccording to FAA, the so-called technical issue was resolved around 4 p.m. on Sunday and there were engineers working on to fix any further technical difficulties in the air traffic control system.\nDelays began building about 9:45 a.m., according to FlightRadar24, a flight monitoring website. Flights bound for airports in the Washington area were some of the most affected, including Washingtonâ€™s Reagan National Airport and Dulles International, as well as Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and Charlotte-Douglas International Airport in North Carolina.\nBy mid afternoon, 50 percent of inbound flights and 42 percent of outbound flights had been cancelled at Reagan National, and delays were averaging about three hours, according to FlightRadar24. In Baltimore, 58 percent of inbound flights and 36 of outbound flights had been cancelled, and delays were averaging over an hour.\nFlights departing from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York that normally flight over the Washington region as they head southward were also affected, although the FAA had said it was trying to route the flights around the affected area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T09:17:01.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
