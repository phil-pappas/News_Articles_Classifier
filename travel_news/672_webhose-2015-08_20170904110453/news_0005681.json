I remember I was on the Facebook group for 2014/15 for the university and I saw on the page that people were saying they had got in – so I knew at that point I hadn’t been accepted. In a way, I was mentally prepared before I found out from the university. I wouldn’t say I was heartbroken but I was definitely disappointed. However, after a while, I realised I had to get on with it. At the time I was working so didn’t have time to sit there and feel sorry for myself, I had to think “OK, what’s Plan B?” So I got my Clearing code, woke up early, and set myself a mission to get it done. I’m originally from Birmingham, so it never occurred to me to stay here. I always thought I’d go out and explore a different city with a different vibe, and see what was on offer. But when I saw BCU on the Clearing site, it was then that I questioned whether I should actually stay in Birmingham – for me, it felt like the power was in my hands. \"If it doesn’t feel right to you, don’t do it, simple as that.\" Heather Tulloch I chose marketing, advertising and PR at Birmingham City University because it was easily accessible; I had the grades required, and I liked the course and what it had to offer. Looking at the university I didn’t get into, and the course I would have done there, and the course I’m doing now, I’m actually in a better place, so coming here has definitely worked out for me. That statement that 'everything happens for a reason' is definitely true. You hear stories sometimes of people who have gone to study courses that they didn’t enjoy, but I know that I'm in a good situation and in a good place, that it feels right, and that I can only grow from here. I’m glad that everything went in the direction that it did because at the time I was thinking “Clearing? What just happened?\" But it worked out and I’m happy. With Clearing, I would say don’t be disheartened if you haven’t got into your first choice – sometimes these things happen for a reason. Don’t panic because it will work out in the end and it can maybe be for the best. And if it doesn’t feel right to you, don’t do it, simple as that. • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:52:00.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
