Mr Mullen, who took the helm at Ladbrokes in April, is attempting to revive the fortunes of the bookie and the write-down forms part of efforts for a fresh start under his leadership. \nLadbrokes, which has fallen behind main rival William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) in recent years, is already seeing drastic changes under its new boss. \nLast month, Mr Mullen announced that the bookie had agreed terms on a £2.3bn merger with smaller peer Coral that will create the country’s biggest gambling company by betting shops. Ladbrokes must now steer the deal through the competition authorities , who could yet scupper the tie-up. \nSeparately, the bookie also unveiled a new strategy to boost the number of punters that bet with Ladbrokes both in its shops and online . Mr Mullen admitted that Ladbrokes had lost ground to William Hill in sports-betting and plans to close the gap with a three-year investment programme. \nLast Thursday, shares in William Hill tumbled when the bookie posted a 35pc plunge in first-half pre-tax profits to £78.7m after it was hit by higher gambling taxes, new restrictions on gaming machines, and one-off charges at its Australian business. Ladbrokes will also have been affected by the heavier tax burden and tougher gaming machine rules during the half-year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:25:03.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
