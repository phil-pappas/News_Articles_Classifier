August 12, 2015 1:00 am Safe from slaughter Livestock sacrifices will be banned from two upcoming Hindu festivals in Nepal, officials said recently, though no decision has yet been finalised with respect to the Gadhimai ceremony, which sees hundreds of thousands of animals slaughtered every five years. There would be no sacrifices during the February festival of Holi, where people spray each other with coloured powder and water, nor during the harvest festival of Sankranti in January, Ram Chandra Sah, chairman of the Gadhimai Trust, noted. \"But the committee hasn't said anything about the five-yearly sacrifices for the Gadhimai ceremony\". Around 200,000 animals, mostly buffalo calves, were sacrificed at the most recent Gadhimai festival in November 2014. - DPA Travel warning to Iran lifted Britain lifted an official warning against all but essential travel to Iran last week, citing \"decreased hostility\" in the wake of a landmark nuclear deal.
