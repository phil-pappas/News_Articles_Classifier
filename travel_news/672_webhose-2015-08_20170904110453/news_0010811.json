The number of Chinese tourists plunged 27.1% for the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period last year. Obviously, Malaysia’s loss is other countries’ gain.”\n“Why are some quarters paranoid about social ills when countries around the world welcome Chinese visitors with open arms? China tourists are the world’s biggest spenders and they are known to empty the shelves of luxury stores in London, Paris, Rome and New York. Last year, 2.2 million China tourists spent a staggering RM86 billion in the United States, or a whopping RM40, 000 per visitor!”\n“Anyone who is overly concerned on social ills should first scrutinize the elephant in the room, and that is the millions of undocumented workers in the country. In contrast, only 1,493 Chinese tourists were found to have overstayed last year and 612 were involved in immoral activities. It is a miniscule figure against the 1,613,355 that visited Malaysia in 2014.”\n“Over 3,000 travel and tour companies are MATTA members with 96% licensed for inbound.\nAlso, 50% of MATTA members have Bumiputras as the major shareholders. They put in an\nhonest day’s work in this highly competitive business. It is easy for those not in the travel\nbusiness to call for more creativity in tourism packages to boost arrivals.”\n“Local tourism industry players are only asking for a level playing field to compete equally\nwith other countries. Those shackled by imaginary fears tend to make unfounded comments,\nand if left unchecked could be repeated and later accepted as truth.”\n“Given the current situation and depreciation of the ringgit, our politicians and civil servants\nshould be supporting businesses such as tourism to bring in the much needed foreign exchange, and not resort to rhetoric.”\n“Apart from the four ASEAN nations that share borders with Malaysia, the largest numbers of visitors are from China and India. To attract even more, MATTA had been advocating that they be allowed to enter and stay in Malaysia for up to 15 days without visas.”\nWisma MATTA, No 6, Jalan Metro Pudu 2, Fraser Business Park, Off Jln Yew, 55100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n“This will be consistent with Malaysia’s liberal visa policy as nationals from four countries\nmay enter Malaysia without visas and stay for 14 days; Taiwanese for 15 days which would\nsoon be extended to 30 days; 99 countries for 30 days; and another 58 countries for 90 days”,\nHamzah pointed out.\nSource:- MATTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:15:13.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
