The multi-functional App, which is free to use and is the first of its kind to launch in Hong Kong, offers MICE bookers and events planners an invaluable platform enabling them to manage and keep track of their events in one place. It is also an invaluable tool for participants, offering them not only a central point of reference but a ‘one stop shop’ providing everything they need to know about attending an event at the venue. \nThe MICE App, which can be downloaded free of charge on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, features a wide range of functionality. As a communication tool it enables organisers to easily and effectively keep in touch with participants while providing them with access to everything they need to know about the event, from venue information and timings to speaker’s profiles. It can also be used to support real time polling amongst participants during events and to streamline the registration process for delegates using the QR code scanning function. It also has a strong environmental benefit as it significantly reduces the amount of paper-based material needed for each event held at the hotel. br> Belinda Yeung, Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer of Regal Hotels International said: “Here at Regal Hotels we pride ourselves on our track record of innovation and staying one step ahead of the opposition when it comes to our world class MICE offering and we’re constantly looking for ways to up our game and improve on our offering across our portfolio of 14 hotels. br> “Our new MICE App, which has been created to both facilitate and anticipate the needs of event bookers and particpants, effectively placing control of their event at their fingertips, is just the latest in a long line of enhancements, from installing the state-of-the-art high-definition ‘LED Wall’ in the Versailles Ballroom at Regal Kowloon Hotel to launching great value offers such as Book More, Enjoy More – all backed by Regal’s dedicated and highly experienced in-house MICE teams. This is why we say to international MICE planners and bookers, ‘Think MICE events in Hong Kong, think Regal Hotels’.” br> Top selling properties for MICE events in the operator's portfolio include the Regal Airport Hotel. In addition to featuring a market leading Meeting & Conference Centre strong selling points include the convenience of being connected directly to Hong Kong International Airport via a covered walkway and the airport VIP ‘Meet & Greet’ service it offers guests and event attendees. In addition the property features 30 function rooms, including a Grand Hotel Ballroom that can hold 1,500 people, and a Business Centre that offers everything from temporary office space to secretarial services.
