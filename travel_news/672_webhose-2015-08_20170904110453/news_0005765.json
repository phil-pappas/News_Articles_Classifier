Bookings have already grown 8% compared to the same period last year. \nThe challenge offers meeting planners and conference bookers the opportunity to win prizes ranging from a corporate hospitality package for 8 people at one of Leicester Tigers home games for next season to a signed & framed squad shirt. With just over a month to go before the Rugby World Cup, Leicester Tigers are starting to see a surge in last minute bookings as clients want to align their events with the biggest sporting event of the year to hit these shores. Conference & Banqueting Business Development Manager, Rachael Betts, who is spearheading the campaign says “Capita have really taken to this activity and it is great to see them working so hard for their prizes. We are actively encouraging the other competing agencies to catch up with Capita and there are definitely a couple of others desperate to win – it will definitely go down to the wire.” Betts continues, “As part of the redevelopment plans for the Club, we are also increasing the size of our meetings portfolio, allowing us to offer even better facilities to our clients.”.
