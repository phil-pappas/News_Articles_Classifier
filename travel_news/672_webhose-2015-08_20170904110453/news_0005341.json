This city is gorgeous. Enchanting gabled houses sit alongside more than 60 miles of canals traversed by 1,500 bridges.\nColourful markets, charming windmills, a confusion of trams, buses, cars and many thousands of bicycles all blend into a dazzling display.\nWe hadn’t realised there’s also a hop-on-hop-off boat, but decided to get our water fix with a canal cruise. For yet another perspective on the city, take a night-time ­cocktail or dinner cruise.\nSaddle up Easy riders: Amsterdam is flat and there are plenty of cycle lanes making it perfect for exploring on a bike\nTalking of transport, the most popular way to get around is by bicycle.\nForget lycra and helmets – most people here pedal around in their normal clothes. We even spotted cyclists whizzing around wearing high heels or carrying umbrellas.\nIt does help that there are cycle lanes everywhere and there’s hardly a hill to be seen. Bear in mind the city has 60,000 cycle thefts a year, so if you hire one watch where you leave it.\nIf you want to visit another city whilst out there, you can book train tickets via thetrainline Europe before leaving the UK , and can save around 50% off the on-the-day fare.\nFinding accommodation: How to find hotels on a budget Tripadvisor has a handy price guide on the 30 best hotels in Amsterdam.\nHotel Trivago also lists competitive prices all year round - and fares tend to drop when seriously last minute, as hotels rush to fill rooms.\nAmsterdam is famous for its hostel culture, and hostels rooms can be pretty cheap - if you're willing to stay in a room with others. If not, try Airbnb - you can pick rooms, or an entire apartment, and even haggle at the cost.\nIf you're booking a late deal, lastminute.com also offer some top late deals throughout the year.\nSights to see... Essential: The Anne Frank Museum is a must-see\nEven if museums aren’t your thing, be sure to visit the Anne Frank House . Avoid the worst of the queues by getting there early.\nWe found it overwhelming. I defy anyone not to feel emotional seeing where the Jewish teenager and her family hid from the Nazis during World War II.\nIt was there she wrote her famous diary before dying aged 16 at Belsen concentration camp.\nI was reduced to tears by the wall of pictures she cut from magazines to brighten her dingy surroundings.\nArt lovers will enjoy the Rijksmuseum , the Van Gogh and the Stedelijk . If, like us, your time is limited, it’s still worth exploring the area for the sculptures and artwork on hoardings.\nPlaces to dine-out: Cafe society Daily Mirror Not exactly a tea cake: You can get something stronger in Amsterdam's coffee shops\nThe customers in Amsterdam’s coffee shops are there for the cannabis not the cappuccino. It’s all legal and licensed. You can even choose from “hash” and “weed” menus.\nNot really our sort of joint, so we passed on that.\nTripadvisor has a handy guide on places to eat-out and order takeaway from in Amsterdam . All are reviewed, so you can get a taste of what's to come, before you even book your flight.\nSauce with that? Getty Up front: Amsterdam's red light district\nI was aware that Amsterdam has a risqué reputation so I was prepared to see ladies of the night in the red light district. But we were quite taken aback to see so much flesh in the infamous shop windows in broad daylight.\nWalk in the park The oasis that is Vondelpark has 10million visitors a year. It’s the city’s largest park and there are lots of quiet places to chill. In the summer it puts on free concerts.\nMake a meal of it Plenty to choose from: An Amsterdam cheese shop\nAlso free are the samples offered by the city’s many cheese shops – so many we skipped lunch.\nBut we dined more sumptuously in the 5&33 restaurant – also a popular bar, library, lounge and art gallery – at the quirky new art’hotel. Its tapas-style dishes were the height of yumminess.\nAmsterdam bike tours: Dutch-style hitchhiking If you want to experience Amsterdam like a true Dutch, they've just launched a new Yellow Bike summer initiative - offering tourists the opportunity to explore the city through a bike tour.\nYellow Bike, aims to spark some love between Amsterdam locals and its visitors, by embracing a famous Dutch custom: riding on the luggage rack of a friend’s bike.\nVideo loading\nHow does it work?\nAll Amsterdammers with a bike are invited to swap their luggage rack for a free yellow one. By doing so, they invite friendly strangers to hop on and join them for a ride through their beloved city. Visiting spots you will never even find in a Lonely Planet.\nHanny Kooij CEO at Yellow Bike said: “We discovered the new generation of tourists doesn’t really want to feel like a tourist.\n\"They wish to be part of the city and blend in like a local. The only way to really do this is to be guided by someone who knows the city by heart.”\nGo to YellowBackie.org for more information.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.thetrainline-europe.com/", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants-g188590-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g188590-d189379-Reviews-The_Rijksmuseum_National_Museum-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jg8xyP8iT84?enablejsapi=1&version=3", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190676-Reviews-Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g188590-d189384-Reviews-Vondelpark-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html", "http://yellowbackie.org/", "http://www.trivago.co.uk/amsterdam-46814/hotel", "https://www.airbnb.co.uk/", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190555-Reviews-Anne_Frank_House_Anne_Frankhuis-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html", "http://www.lastminute.com/", "http://www.easyjet.com/en/cheap-flights", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Flights-g188590-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html", "http://www.lastminute.com/flights/amsterdam.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g188590-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province-Hotels.html", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-08-07T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T07:23:42.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
