This is big news for hotel operators. 66% of hotel guests are between the ages of 18 and 48. Half of these are mobile Millennials who operate from the palm of their hand. How well do operators know them? What do they eat, when do they stay, what do they like to do? How do they communicate? Maestro Analytics Business Intelligence system tracks each behavior on property for more effective email marketing. E-Blast marketing doesn’t work anymore\n“We know who our guests are because Maestro Analytics business intelligence knows. All our guests’ stay information and preference data is in Analytics, we use it to market to them personally and effectively,” this from Libby Stowe, Front Office Manager at Campbell’s Resort in Washington. “E-blast marketing doesn’t work anymore because guests are not the same.
