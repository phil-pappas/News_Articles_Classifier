For example, the 2008-2009 recession hit municipal tax revenues, which in turn, halted their purchases of sewer cleaning trucks. That situation reversed in 2010 and demand for these trucks has been growing steadily ever since. Currently, the North American oil and gas industry is in a slump but that also is expected to reverse, and along with it purchases of vacuum trucks.\nThe industry producing vacuum trucks is very fragmented. The leading player, Federal Signal, which owns Guzzler Manufacturing, Inc. and Vactor Manufacturing, Inc., has less than a 20% market share. More than 50 other companies producing these products split the remaining 80% of production.\nA variety of demand, technology, regulatory and competitive issues now are affecting the vacuum truck industry. These include the impact of urbanization, EPA/DOT and state regulations and industry consolidation. The products offered and suppliers remaining in five years are forecast to be very different than today.\nThese and other issues are analyzed in this report, to provide a perspective on the industry structure and dynamics of this highly specialized industry.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.
