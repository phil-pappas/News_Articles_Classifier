Get rid of them with these simple steps. (Shutterstock Photo) \nAre you troubled by dark circles and wish to get rid of them? We give you seven simple ways to make the black bags under your eyes vanish naturally. \nNutritious diet \nVitamins like A,C, K and E and iron can help to minimise dark circles. A balanced diet is very important, which includes fresh fruits, salads, sprouts, unprocessed cereals, yogurt, skimmed milk, cottage cheese (paneer), lentils, beans, leafy green vegetables, egg and fish. Have different varieties of fruits, as they prevent dehydration. Consult your doctor before making changes in your diet and also ask your doctor about vitamin and mineral supplements. \nWater \nDrink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. Also, have the juice of a lemon mixed in a glass of water in the morning. \nSunscreen \nBefore going out in the sun, apply a sunscreen lotion sparingly under the eyes. For a lighter coverage, add a drop of water to it before applying. \nCleansing gel or cream \nIt should be used to remove make-up, using moist cotton wool. Very light-textured creams or serums should be used around the eyes. \nAlmond oil \nApply it daily using only the ring finger, for one minute under each eye. You should also massage it lightly on the skin. Remember to massage in one direction only. Leave it on for 15 minutes and wipe off gently with moist cotton wool. Almonds and almond oil help to lighten skin colour and produce an even colour tone. It also nourishes the skin under the eyes. \nCucumber, tomato, potato and lemon juices \nCucumber is an astringent and also helps to reduce dark circles. It should be applied daily around eyes and washed off with plain water after 15 minutes. Dark circles can also be treated by mixing cucumber juice with lemon juice and tomato juice in equal quantities. Apply daily and wash off with water after 15 minutes. Tomato, lemon and potato juices are also said to lighten skin colour. In fact, potato juice and cucumber juice may be mixed together and applied under the eyes. Wash off after 15 minutes. \nExercise and relaxation \nInclude deep breathing exercises, like Pranayama, in your exercise schedule. This helps to counteract stress and also oxygenates the body, reducing dark circles. Adequate sleep and relaxation are also important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:09:36.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
