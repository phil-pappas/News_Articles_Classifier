An expansion at the former NorthPointe Hotel and Conference Center has added 74 rooms to the facility. The renamed Nationwide Hotel and Conference Center underwent a four-month renovation that increased its guest capacity by 60 percent, giving it 127 rooms and 66 suites. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. , owner of the 100 Green Meadows Drive facility, declined to disclose the project's cost. “The renovation and expansion will enhance our ability to serve our traditional corporate clients, while also helping us appeal to a wider range of business, including local and state associations, conferences and conventions,\" Kathryn Burton , the hotel’s general manager, said in a press release. Nationwide a few years ago sought to further expand marketing of the facility as an independent hotel and event center for the business community and the public at large. The campus opened in 1974 as a Nationwide conference center and retreat. \nWant Columbus Commercial Real Estate   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:10:46.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
