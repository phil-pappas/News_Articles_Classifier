In partnership with S.C. Grand Plaza Hotel S.A., the milestone debut builds upon the Sheraton first mover advantage in the region and expands the brand’s European portfolio to more than 60 hotels. \n“As a market debut for Starwood and Sheraton, Romania symbolizes an important expansion opportunity while also putting Sheraton one step closer to its goal of opening more than 150 new hotels over the next five years,” said Dave Marr, Global Brand Leader, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. “Demonstrating best in class design and offerings in a historically rich part of the world, Sheraton Bucharest Hotel is an excellent addition to the brand’s global portfolio.” Sheraton Bucharest Hotel features 270 spacious guest rooms, including 27 Executive Suites and one exquisite Presidential Suite. Guests looking to stay active while on the road can work out at the Sheraton® Fitness Center, which includes two massage rooms and spa treatment facilities. Located on the 18th floor, the Sheraton® Club lounge offers guests stunning views of Bucharest as well as complimentary breakfast, all-day refreshments, and free Wi-Fi. The property offers easy access to business districts as well as upscale dining, shopping, and entertainment options. Piata Romana subway station, a stone’s throw away from the hotel, offers a quick connection to Old Town, Victoria Palace, several renowned museums, and the city’s prestigious Palace of the Parliament—the second largest building in the world after the Pentagon. “Sheraton has a robust footprint across Europe, and we are delighted to continue to increase our portfolio with developments in strategic new markets such as Romania,” said Michael Wale, President, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Europe, Africa & Middle East. “The emerging city of Bucharest presents immense growth potential, and we look forward to welcoming travellers to our most iconic hotel brand.” An ideal setting for functions, the hotel boasts 1,200 square meters of combined meeting and event space. The hotel offers 10 conference rooms, two ballrooms and one distinguished boardroom. Each conference room can hold between 10 - 400 people, and together, the 10 rooms can accommodate up to 1,400 individuals. All spaces are equipped with state-of-the-art audio-visual technology and are backed by an outstanding events team. Two distinctive dining venues provide a variety of culinary options—from a contemporary twist on Romania’s cuisine at Avalon to the world-renowned Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi Bar Benihana—in addition to Centro Sweets, which offers a selection of desserts, from freshly baked cakes to tantalizing tarts, in a cozy ambience. The property is less than an 18-minute drive from Henri Coanda International Airport (OTP). Alternatively, visitors can travel by train to the North Train Station, only 3 kilometers away from the hotel. Private taxi service is available outside the stop. Sheraton is extending its reach in Europe with several debuts in sought-after destinations. In addition to Sheraton Bucharest, key openings this year included Sheraton Lake Como Hotel, the brand’s eighth in Italy, Sheraton Ufa in Russia and Sheraton Samsun in Turkey.
