The scenic drive attracted nearly 14 million visitors in 2014.\nThis year Jason Frye, a Wilmington, N.C.-based travel writer, published Blue Ridge Parkway Road Trip (Moon/Avalon Travel, $19.99).\nWe asked him to name great spots along the route that motorists often overlook.\nBalsam Mountain, N.C. Milepost 458\nBalsam Mountain Road is “a 14-mile back-country gravel road that goes around Balsam Mountain along the ridge lines and back down to Cherokee. You really have to commit to it because it becomes a one-way pretty quickly, and takes about an hour and a half from one end to the other,” Frye says. “If you’re looking for spring wildflowers, rhododendrons in summer or one of the best fall leaf drives, try this.”\nFolk Art Center, N.C. Milepost 382\n“I’m always surprised how few people visit the Folk Art Center,” near Asheville, Frye says. It’s an excellent stop — almost like a commercial outlet for the Penland School of Crafts or John P. Campbell Folk School, filled with Appalachian crafts and folk art pieces ( southernhighlandguild.org ).\nLittle Switzerland, N.C. Milepost 331\n“People know there’s the Museum of North Carolina Minerals at the exit, and some know there’s actually emerald mining around there. Stop at Emerald Village, a collection of old emerald mines bunched together. That’s fun and interesting. You can actually walk back into the old mines.”\nA few miles north is Spruce Pine. Nathan Allen, chef at a restaurant called Knife & Fork, is well known in the Asheville community as a master forager. “Dining at Knife & Fork is a really elegant, high-end experience in an unexpected location,” Frye says.\nThe Orchard at Altapass, Spruce Pine, N.C. Milepost 328\n“The orchard produces 120,000 bushels of apples, some from heirloom trees, and it has you-pick-’em in late summer and fall. But from May to about October, it also offers events and some great classes in Appalachian culture and folkways”\n( altapassorchard.org ).\nLinville Falls, N.C. Milepost 316.3\n“People who visit here too often give up on the hike and don’t push on the half-mile to Erwin View, a peak-to-bald vista. And the plunge-basin overlooks, on the north side of the falls, give you a really good view of just how deep Linville Gorge is.”\nSally Mae’s, Glendale Springs, N.C. Milepost 259 This is a little deli and gallery. “A little farther down the Parkway at Milepost 260.3 is a 1-mile hike that goes to a concrete overlook where there are great fall photo opportunities at Jumpinoff Rock. It’s a relatively easy hike with a slight incline on the way back.”\nChateau Morrisette, Va. Milepost 171.5\nChateau Morrisette, one of the oldest vineyards in the state, is still something of a secret. “There’s a good little bistro on the winery grounds, and a live-music series. There are several celebrations through the year that are good to see.”\nFloyd, Va. Milepost 165\n“Floyd is a free-spirited little mountain town where you have this odd confluence of old Virginia farming families and an artist-hippie community that has moved in. One thing that makes Floyd special is that it’s one of the stops on the Crooked Road — Virginia’s tourism route linking old-time music and mountain heritage. In the Country Store, a general mercantile in Floyd, they clear out the aisles and roll back the shelving on Friday nights for a big dance floor and have a jamboree with regional or national bluegrass or old-time bands. You can see three generations of families out there dancing.”\nBedford, Va. Milepost 86\nBedford is a great jumping-off point for exploring Roanoke or for boating at Smith Mountain Lake. “You’re close enough to those spots ... but far enough away to feel you’re absorbing some of Bedford’s small-town charm,” Frye says. The National D-Day Memorial ( dday.org ) is in Bedford; there’s also a wine trail and apple orchards.\nPeaks of Otter Recreation Area, Va. Milepost 85.9\nFrye says people typically go on the BRP to do a lot of short, less-challenging hikes. “The two here are different: The climb to Sharp Top is 3 miles and pretty steep; the climb to Round Top is 9 miles — not strenuous, but long. Both hikes are fantastic and have gorgeous views.” He says they’re both doable, with the right equipment.\nJohn Bordsen,\nThe Charlotte Observer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T01:33:51.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
