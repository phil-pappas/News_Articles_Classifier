The new platform called The Edit by Six Senses aggregates user generated and brand content through the use of hashtags and key words in social platform posts.\nTitled The Edit by Six Senses, guests visiting the website of Six Senses can enter into the social media world of the brand through the group’s home page or via dedicated microsite. Pulling content from Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, The Edit by Six Senses, features the best and most interesting content shared by users as well as Six Senses resorts and spas. Updates to the feed occur daily, so the content is always changing.\nSix Senses prioritized the importance of connecting with guests and fans at a deeper level through social media in 2015. The brand’s objectives were to grow its social IQ by educating Six Senses hosts about the most important social media channels and functionality, while simultaneously inspiring guests through the publishing of rich, engaging content. Teams were selected as social media ambassadors at all resorts and in the spa division and the most talented individuals joined the Six Senses Social Media Academy which ran over a period of eight months. Channel tutorials were held on a monthly basis and included daily homework, channel testing and a final exam.\n“We are now ready to elevate our efforts and celebrate our social media success through the launch of The Edit by Six Senses. This dedicated micro site, not only allows us to curate the best content, but makes it easy for guests to search content, photos and videos by property location and subject,” said Julia Gajcak, vice president marketing and communications. “We’ve seen some tremendous work and creative content developed at all levels of the organization and look forward to evolving our social media and online presence in the months ahead.”\nThe brand’s first campaign entitled #outoftheordinary celebrates what makes the unique group of resorts and spas so special. From paragliding arrivals off a mountain cliff in Oman at Six Senses Zighy Bay; oenology and wine certification programs in Portugal at Six Senses Douro Valley to behind the scenes access to pandas in China at Six Senses Qing Cheng Mountain – Six Senses it’s all about the discovery of your fun side, your emotional side and your connection and reconnection with yourself and those around you.\nSource:- Six Senses", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:08:44.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
