Suzy Strutner Associate Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/26/2015 04:07 PM EDT | Edited: 33 minutes ago \nIf you travel mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, then you may have always imagined New Zealand as one singular island. Yet savvy travelers know the country actually consists of ï»¿two main islands : the North and the South. \nNew Zealand's North Island is a hub for Maori culture, a hotspot for scuba divers and home to the cosmopolitan cities of Auckland and Wellington. But as it turns out, New Zealand's sensationally beautiful and significantly less populous South Island is a sprawling, rugged paradise many tourists have shockingly failed to appreciate . Antony Harrison Sunset on the island's west coast. Antony Harrison Nugget Point, where you'll traverse some rocky headlands. Antony Harrison Glenorchy, a remote lakeside settlement. \nPolynesian tribes were the first to inhabit South Island , long before Dutch explorer Abel Tasman rediscovered the land in 1642 and they were subsequently called Maori. Currently, South Island's population is about one-third of the North's, but what it lacks in human capital, it more than makes up in natural beauty: South Island is home to nine national parks (one named for Tasman ), and offers encounters with dolphins, penguins, whales and birds . Small fishing villages dot the coast, and all around you'll find stunning peaks, oceans, volcanoes, glaciers, fjords and snow-dusted Southern Alps . \n\"This is the real New Zealand,\" photographer Antony Harrison , whose images are shown here, told The Huffington Post of East Cape , a rural corner of the island's coast. \"There is more to discover [on South Island] than probably any place on Earth.\" Antony Harrison Hooker Lake, a glacial lake popular with hikers. Antony Harrison Church of the Good Shepherd, on Lake Tekapo. Antony Harrison Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain. Antony Harrison Punakaiki Beach, known for spectacular ocean blowholes. \nAdventuring is huge on South Island: Glacier climbing, bungee jumping, hot air ballooning and skiing are popular with daring travelers. You'll find some of New Zealand's best \" walks ,\" or scenic hiking trails, in the forests, mountains and riverbanks. \nIt takes about three and a half hours to get to South island via ferries from North Island that operate year-round. Alternatively, you can take a flight from North Island or Australia proper. Happy travels! Antony Harrison The view from Roteburn Track, a popular alpine trail.
