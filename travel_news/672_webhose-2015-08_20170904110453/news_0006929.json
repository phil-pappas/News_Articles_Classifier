Operated with an Airbus 330-300 offering 30 seats in Business and 275 in Economy, the additional flights will allow even more connection opportunities for customers flying from the Middle East, the U.S., Europe and Africa. \nFor the Doha-Asmara route, all flights are operated with Airbus A320 aircraft in a two-class configuration with 12 seats in Business Class and up to 132 seats in Economy. The Asmara expansion comes only nine months after the Eritrean capital was first introduced in December 2014 and demonstrates the growing demand for this route. \nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “Qatar Airways is committed to continually enhancing the five-star experience we offer to all our customers and this further expansion is in direct response to a growing demand on these popular routes. We are delighted to offer even more opportunities for our customers across the globe to connect through Doha’s state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport to both Eritrea and Bangladesh, flying on board one of the youngest fleets in the industry.” \nQatar Airways has seen rapid growth in just 18 years of operation and today flies a modern fleet of 163 aircraft to 151 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America.
