Once upon a time, not too long ago, in this very land, a man called Tony Blair woke up one morning and had an idea. His idea was this: “We need better qualified young people so they can get better, high skilled jobs, earn more money and pay more tax and boost our economy!” It seemed like a jolly good idea so Tony started making it a reality. He called for half of all the young people in the land to be sent to university and, when this was done, they would each be given a piece of paper that said how clever they were. And then millions of highly-skilled jobs would magically appear and everyone would live happily ever after. The end. Almost 25 per cent of all 21-year-olds who left university with a degree are unemployed Photo: ALAMY The only trouble with this fairy tale is it is just that: made-up. There is, it turns out, no unbending law of economics that if you create highly-skilled employees, then the jobs will just follow automatically . And so we find ourselves now in a land that is very far away indeed from that envisaged all those years ago. Instead of a highly skilled workforce earning good wages for highly skilled work, we have an averagely skilled workforce earning a pittance for doing unskilled work which mostly seems to consist of serving cappuccinos. A new study has revealed that more than half of British graduates are currently working in jobs that do not require a degree . The research for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development showed that 58.8 per cent of UK graduates have ended up in non-graduate jobs, and around one in 12 of those working in low skilled jobs, such as in coffee shops, bars, call centres and at hospitality events, are now graduates. Judge Andrew Tolley: 'I'd like to see a bit more appreciation for the huge flavour complexity coffee has' Ever since Tony Blair had his lightbulb moment, politicians have been obsessed with creating more and more graduates despite all the evidence that having more people with degrees does not, on its own, create more degree-level jobs. And despite the fact that a large percentage of the degrees being handed out aren’t worth the paper they are printed on. Let’s consider some key facts: we have 54 per cent graduates among our young people. Germany has 31 per cent. And which country do you think has the best educated and most highly-skilled workforce? Exactly. This is a ridiculous state of affairs but it isn’t remotely funny. And particularly not for the young people – many from poor families - who have been sold this Big Fat Lie. They have been told that, if they get a degree – in anything at all – then the world is their oyster. But instead of finding their pearl inside after three years of study, all they are left with is a worthless piece of paper and thousands of pounds of debt amid the grit of those three lost years of earning potential. And half of them can barely string a grammatically correct sentence together. We now have an entire generation of young people who have paper qualifications coming out of their ears but barely anything between their ears . Photo: REX The truth is that not all degrees are worth the same. A third class degree from the London Metropolitan University in “Media Studies and Communication” is not, whatever your careers adviser might tell you, worth the same as a First in law from Cambridge. But nobody bothered to tell the millions of young people who have taken up places and got into huge debt to get a degree in Travel and Tourism from a former polytechnic that hands out 2:1s like confetti to anyone who can write their name in the correct box. While sending just 10 per cent of young people to university, as used to be the case in my parents’ generation, undoubtedly meant that perfectly bright and able youngsters missed out on getting a degree, the move to 50 per cent never made sense. University was never meant to be for everybody. It was always supposed to be for the more academic students. Now that the Government has lifted the cap on the number of students universities can recruit, the problem will get worse rather than better. Even now, an estimated 45 per cent of graduates will never earn enough to repay their fees. University is, and should be, about elitism. And that’s not a bad thing, in the same way that the Olympic Games are not a bad thing: they’re about the best athletes, not the top 50 per cent of people who quite fancy having a stab at running 100 metres. Academia should be no different. Every young person in this country deserves to be offered every opportunity. But if university is open to everyone, no matter what a student has or can achieve, then degrees become meaningless and being a graduate is worthless. The answer is simple: limit the number of university places to, say, 25 or 30 per cent of young people, and to require all publicly funded degrees to have some intellectual or professional value (so it’s goodbye to Media Studies and Youth Studies). That way degrees and graduates will both re-establish their worth to future employers. Having dreams is all very well, but our young people deserve a real future, not one based on fairytales. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:20:27.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
