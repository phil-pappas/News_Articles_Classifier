This sleepy town has had the ghosts vanquished. Source: Flickr \nPERCHED in the hills of Umbria, an Italian region bordering Tuscany, rests the historic medieval town of Castello di Postignano. \nIt has the honour of being the latest ancient village to be transformed by a group who are fast becoming known as Italy’s ghostbusters. \nThe picturesque town was once a thriving hub, filled with fabric-dying and wool-making artisans. But constant trembles and a devastating earthquake in 1967 led residents to flee, leaving the humble hillside village as a ghost town. \nIt’s just one of a number of Italian villages in the country to suffer such a fate over the past century, leaving the high stone walls filled with nothing but shadows. Some of these towns have even begun offering houses to the public for free. \nAccording to a number of local reports , Italy has around 20,000 of these so-called “sleeping beauties” as residents have migrated to bigger cities or elsewhere in Europe, in search of a better life. There is purported to be 6,000 which are completely empty and another 15,000 on the brink. \nIt’s a figure that Dr Ted Robinson from Sydney University is sceptical about and called “absolutely absurd”. \nBut while he thinks the number is nowhere near that high, he admits there are plenty of towns laying dormant. The archeology lecturer spent a great deal of time in Italy and saw first-hand the emptying of the Italian countryside. \nHe also understands the unique identity these towns provide for their inhabitants. \n“Italians are passionately interested in cultural heritage,” he told news.com.au \n“It’s easy to understand why there’s a desire to rescue (these towns) from oblivion.” \nAnd governments seeking to do so are quickly learning who they ought to call in order to vanquish the ghosts and repopulate these sleeping hamlets.

They’ve spearheaded an ambitious program to bring the entire area back from the dead by building over 50 medieval houses, complete with all the old barns, stables, prison cells and school classrooms. \n“What better life project could there be for any architect than to be given the chance to reshape an entire hamlet how he pleases?” Gennaro Matacena told Ozy , one of the two Naples architects responsible for the resurrection. \nWhat’s most remarkable is these projects are being exclusively taken up by private actors. With much of Europe struggling through a period of economic austerity, it’s befallen to savvy investors to breath life back into these small cities — and some of them are gaining folk hero status in the process.

Source: Supplied \nWealthy businessman Daniele Kihlgren or the Saviour of Santo Stefano, as he is also known , is one of those people. He is dedicated to restoring the hamlets of southern Italy and considered one of the pioneers of the movement. \nFor centuries these towns have represented “a minor, secondary heritage that has been neglected and fallen into oblivion,” he told the Ozy. He admits they might not have the notoriety of some of Italy’s bigger towns, but their cultural importance is undeniable. \nAfter falling in love with Santo Stefano he began buying up a number of the little hillside properties and over a decade ago, he struck an unprecedented deal with the local officials. In return for a blanket ban on new building, he promised to invest a serious amount of money —€4.5 million ($A6.79 million) at the time — to revamping the ghost town. \nShortly after the influx of money, a local hotel, made up of a cluster of medieval cottages opened its doors. It proved a giant success and helped breath life back into the hamlet. \n“There’s a widespread belief that a cultural or artistic project can never turn into a winning economic project. But that’s not true,” he told Politico . \nHe is also responsible for opening up a luxury resort in Matera in the southern region of Basilicata, which was later used to film Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ. \nBut when there is no wealthy benefactor leading the charge, some towns have had to come up with an alternative solution. The township of Gangi, Sicily, took the drastic step of offering houses to the public for free earlier this year. In June, the local government issued a press release claiming that both companies and individuals could apply for the free houses. \nThere was a catch of course, and those that who accept the generous offer have four years to restore them and make them liveable. \n“We don’t want people just because they have money,” Mr Ferrarello, the mayor told the New York Times . “We want to know what you’re going to do with the houses.” \nThe move came just years after the Sicilian town of Salemi said it would sell buildings ruined by a 1968 earthquake for one euro each — an offer which was met with great excitement but never actually materialised. \nCarrega Ligure, a town in northern Italy tried to do the same in recent years but was met with bothersome bureaucratic problems — namely a law that mandated a competitive price for government owned property sales — and the initiative eventually disappeared. \nThere are so many of these empty towns in the south of the country that Italian journalist Silvia Marchetti has proposed they be used to accommodate the growing number of asylum seekers turning up on Italy’s southern border from Libya. \nDr Robinson returned to Australia from Sicily two weeks ago and referring to the idea said he “wouldn’t be surprised if they gave it ago.” Santo Stefano prison circa 2005.

In fact it was a transformation 19 years in the making. \n“It was a massive job,” Mr Matacena said. Which could be considered an understatement after spending close to two decades dealing with bureaucracy of what would be the equivalent of the local council. \nAnd of course, it was also crucial to build and fortify the houses with engineering that can better withstand the earth’s tremble. \nThe local real estate office in Postignano is now putting all of the town’s refurbished peasant dwellings on sale. While they look the same and still carry some of the visible scars from enemy attacks, the cottages are fitted out with modern creature comforts such as Wi-Fi and satellite TV.
