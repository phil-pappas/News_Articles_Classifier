And yes, she has Karl Lagerfeld’s permission: “He lets me chop dresses, he lets me steal a belt from that dress and wrap it around another . . . I’m really into the performance aspect of it, but I still have to make it my own. I don’t want to feel like I’m wearing a costume,” she says. [ Nylon ]\nFrom one legend to another . . .\nGiorgio Armani received a congratulatory letter for the 40th birthday of his brand from none other than Martin Scorsese. The director sees Armani not only as a great designer, but also as a kindred spirit in his love of film. High praise, indeed. [ Vanity Fair ]\nBangladesh’s big plan . . .\nBangladesh has announced its intention to double its already massive garment exports by 2021. While this initiative may raise concerns among people who care about sustainable and ethical fashion—Bangladesh’s factories are notoriously dangerous—this could be good news: Part of the business plan is to build “garment villages” where health and safety standards will be enforced. [ Quartz ]\nThe new Angel on the block . . .\nGiven her rapidly expanding fame, it’s easy to forget that Stella Maxwell has been a Victoria’s Secret Angel for only a few months. The model recently spoke about her meteoric rise, as well as the joys—and limits—of Instagram. [ Grazia Daily UK ]\nYet another fashion resurrection . . .\nWe recently heard about the rebirth of Paul Poiret, and now it turns out that Reed Krakoff is also coming back to life. Although the latter has been dormant for only a few months, as opposed to Poiret’s decades-long slumber, don’t expect the brand to come back exactly as it was. Though not much is known as of yet, it looks like the new Reed Krakoff will be less upmarket than the old one.
