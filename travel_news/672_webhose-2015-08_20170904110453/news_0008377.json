Air Ventura held the contract which expired last year.\nSupreme Aviation signed a MoU with the MPSTDC earlier this year for three years for Air tax operations in the state, said tourism officials.\nSome changes have been made in the contract with the Air taxi operator, informed MP tourism commissioner Ashwani Lohani to a leading English news daily. He cited that ‘this time, we are not underwriting 3 out of the 9 seats on every flight. Instead, we will subsidize part of the per hour flying cost subject to maximum of Rs 1 crore per month.’\nSupreme Aviation president and CEO Ameet K Agarwal in an interviews to the English daily said that two nine-seater Cessna aircrafts will operate between eight cities in MP and three cities outside MP.\nThe aircrafts will be based in Indore. The eight cities within MP that will get air-connectivity include Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Khajuraho, Satna, Kanha, Bhandhavgarh and Gwalior. The inter-state operations will connect MP with three other cities that include Nagpur, Agra and Ahmedabad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:05:24.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
