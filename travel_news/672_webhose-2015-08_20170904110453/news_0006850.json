We showcase the local agriculture and the beauty of the island.”\nThe festival, founded by the chefs Roy Yamaguchi and Alan Wong, begins with the “Seven Chefs, One Big Island” event at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, then shifts to Maui for five events over three consecutive days, starting with Mr. Yamaguchi’s annual golf tournament at the Kaanapali Golf Course on Sept. 4.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
