But it was suspended in 2013 in a bid to cut costs. \nEmirates operates a fleet of 235 aircraft, serving 147 destinations in 81 countries. \nThe airline has the world's largest fleets of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s, with another 274 planes on order worth US$135 billion (RM543.7 billion). \nIn March, US carriers and American aviation labour groups accused Gulf airlines of enjoying interest-free loans, subsidised airport charges, government protection on fuel losses and below-market labour costs that are considered unfair subsidies by the World Trade Organization. \nThe region's \"Big Three\", Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi's Etihad, have repeatedly denied the accusations and hit back that US carriers are resentful of competition. — AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:50:18.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
