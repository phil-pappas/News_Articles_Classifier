The caves were accessible for nine days this winter; a year earlier, they were accessible for roughly two months and were visited by 138,000 people.\n\"There's so much to see — and then there's even more to see — so we just kept going,\" said Mike Voigt, 40, of Little Chute, Wis. \"We probably walked 6 or 7 miles. The kids loved it because they could crawl into all the nooks and crannies.\"\nBut during the rest of the year, the islands and their lighthouses become the main attraction, and visitors arrive from nearby Bayfield by private craft, water taxi, kayak or excursion boat.\n\"The beauty of nature there is just awesome,\" said Abrams, Wis., resident Bonnie McSwain, 61, who visited last winter with two friends. \"Other places I've been were nothing compared to the Apostles.\"\nA large joint crack runs perpendicular to the face of the cliff at the mainland sea caves creating a narrow opening between 60 foot high sandstone walls at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin. (Photo: National Park Service)\nWhile most of the park remains open this summer, visitors may find a handful of lighthouses, and some adjacent docks, closed for upgrades:\nThe Michigan Island Lightstation and a nearby dock will close from May 15-Aug. 15. After Aug. 15, the grounds will be open but some exhibits might not be completed.\nThe east and west landings for Devils Island Light — first used in 1857 — may be closed until July 15.\nOuter Island Light, built in 1874 as the most remote of the Apostles' lighthouses, will close from July 1 through Nov. 1. Dock closures may also occur.\nLa Pointe Light on Long Island will close from July 15 through Nov. 1. Dock closures may also occur.\nMoney raised from sea caves visitors is helping to pay for temporary employees and equipment to prepare the site for the coming season.\nSchneider also reports for the Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette.\nTo learn about park sites from all 50 states, order USA TODAY’s special edition, National Treasures at onlinestore.usatoday.com.
