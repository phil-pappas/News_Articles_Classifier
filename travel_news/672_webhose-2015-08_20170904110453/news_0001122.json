In addition to the new route (which Bloomberg has figured out to be 8,590 miles), other destinations the airline expects to add later this year to its roster, which has recently placed Madrid, London, and Melbourne on its list: Mashhad in Iran; Orlando, Fla.; Bamako, the capital of Mali; and Bologna, Italy, per the National .
