The Okura’s main building will be torn down next month, although an annexe building next door it to remain open. \n“It is a destruction of culture — this building is a one and only, which truly integrates Japanese aesthetics with a Western-style hotel,” said Tadashi Yamane, professor of urban design at Tokyo City University. \n‘Heartbreaking loss’ \nThe Okura, which was considered an architectural jewel in post-war Japan, opened in 1962, just two years before the Tokyo Olympics. \n“I see the tenacity of the Japanese people more than 50 years ago, who were determined to create a hotel that would prove Japan was once again a good member of the world,” Yamane said. \nThe 510-room new hotel will be set in twin towers — the highest a 41 story glass building — to open in spring 2019, ahead of Tokyo’s Olympic Games the following year. \nCommercial tenants will occupy the upper floors of the property whose lead architect Yoshio Taniguchi is the son of the original hotel’s designer. \n“It is difficult for us now to provide a top Japanese hotel due to the building’s age,” an Okura spokeswoman told AFP. \n“We will conserve traditional Japanese aesthetics but give clients the highest quality rooms and facilities,” she added. \nTyler Brule, editor in chief of Monocle magazine, spearheaded a preservation campaign that included a petition with almost 9,000 signatures. — Picture via HotelOkura.co.jp Petitions to stop the demolition were launched inside and outside Japan, including one by Tomas Maier, creative director of Italian luxury goods firm Bottega Veneta. \nLondon-based lifestyle magazine Monocle launched a “Save the Okura hotel” campaign soon after the reconstruction plan was announced last year. \n“It will be a heartbreaking and irreparable loss,” Monocle said of the closure. \n“Of course, redeveloping the Okura makes sense in purely economic terms... And here’s the problem: the vested interests of construction and property are too powerful to resist.” \nTokyo City University’s Yamane said that mindset highlights a broader issue with destroying heritage buildings in a city of around 30 million people. \nOther properties including the Palace Hotel and upscale Grand Prince Hotel Akasaka have undergone transformations in recent years, partly due to the need to install updated earthquake technology in the seismically active country. \nBut critics say the frantic pace of development — most buildings are now designed to last just a few decades — is driven by a “scrap and build” mentality. \n“But people are not necessarily paying money only for something new and stylish,” Yamane said. \n“They are also paying for an experience that they cannot get anywhere else.” — AFP More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T11:09:47.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
