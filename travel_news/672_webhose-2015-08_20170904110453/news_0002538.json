It's immobile on its own, relying on the kindness of strangers. Those who picked it up often passed it to other travellers or left it where others might notice it.\nIt started in Marblehead, Massachusetts, on July 17 with its thumb raised skyward, a grin on its digital face and tape wrapped around its cylindrical head that read \"San Francisco or bust.\"\nThe robot bounced around the Boston area and was briefly taken to sea. One day, it took in a Red Sox game, checking off one of the items on the bucket list created for it. But hitchBOT never made it off the East Coast.\nThe creators were sent an image of the vandalized robot Saturday but couldn't track its location because the battery is dead. They said they don't know who destroyed it or why.\nThe robot was designed to be a talking travel companion and could toss out factoids and carry limited conversation. A GPS in the robot tracked its location, and a camera randomly snapped photos about every 20 minutes to document its travels.\nDuring past travels, the robot attended a comic convention and a wedding, and it had its portrait painted in the Netherlands. It once spent a week with a heavy metal band.\nWith the robot destroyed, Zeller said, she was most concerned about children who loved hitchBOT and followed it on social media. Her team doesn't plan to release the last photo of it to protect young fans who might be distraught.\n\"I hope that people won't be too disappointed, too sad,\" she said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T21:04:17.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
