Signs Agreement With Professional Relations Firm Acorn Management Partners LLC By GlobeNewswire | 08/05/15 - 07:08 PM EDT Reprint WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Aug. 5, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Urban Hydroponics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (OTCQB:URHY), is pleased to announce that it has signed a contract with Acorn Management Partners LLC (\"AMP\"), a professional relations company based in Atlanta, Georgia. Acorn Management Partners assists emerging growth companies by building shareholder bases through licensed financial professionals and specializes in building long term sustainable markets for publicly traded companies. AMP has been hired in anticipation of URHY's proposed merger with Vancouver-based sister companies Urban Cultivator Inc. and BC Northern Lights Enterprises Ltd. - both leaders in their respective industries. Urban Cultivator, an innovator in the indoor gardening industry, purveyor of sustainability and a promotor of the local food movement, is now selling its indoor growing appliances in 29 countries. Urban Cultivator's completely sustainable indoor growing appliances can be found in high-end restaurants, hotels, and resorts around the globe, including a number of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and Fairmont Hotels. The Urban Cultivator Residential – about the size of a home dishwasher - gives individuals the freedom to grow their own greens 365 days a year, regardless of climate constraints. Urban Cultivator opened its flagship Living Produce Aisle retail concept store in Vancouver in February and has since sold licenses for this concept store in Abu Dhabi and Panama City. Living Produce Aisle (LPA) is a retail concept using Urban Cultivator appliances to grow fresh, healthy and sustainable herbs and greens right in the heart of any city. Greens grown in an LPA store are used to produce uniquely created smoothies, salads and dressings that have been crafted by Urban Cultivator's consulting professional chef. The LPA concept targets both retail customers and restaurant chefs by also selling trays of living herbs and greens – food that has been grown on site, rather than having travelled hundreds of miles on the back of a truck. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T04:29:06.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
