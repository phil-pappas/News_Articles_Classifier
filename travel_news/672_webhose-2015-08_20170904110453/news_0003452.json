Here we acquired two demo Brompton English folding bicycles and learned the nuances of these slick collapsible bikes. We made our way to San Francisco’s Lombard Street and our favorite motel to park our vehicle and begin our two-day exploration of the waterfront. Just a block to the north we cruised down Chestnut Street — a cute Marina neighborhood with the Presidio Theatre, Chestnut Bakery, Pluto Restaurant (“food for a hungry universe”), the Ristobar, Squat & Gobble and many other restaurants and shops. We pedaled north four more blocks to the Marina, toured the wave organ at the end of the marina’s pier (at mid- to high tides, waves drum out a series of musical notes on the pipes, buried as part of the wave organ — a project of the Exploratorium. We then toured west along the beach of Crissy Field (once a 1930s Army airfield) to Fort Point underneath the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge. This Civil War-era fort is styled exactly like Fort Sumter, South Carolina; the National Park Service’s docents show you how soldiers served in the 1850s and ’60s. While the fort never saw duty during the Civil War, it was ready to defend San Francisco Bay against Confederate attackers. From this point, it would’ve been easy to head across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito — had we wanted to extend our pedaling . Riding on to Tiburon on bike trails would allow us to take the ferry back to Pier 41, not far from our motel; we’ll save that adventure for the next time. Returning, we explored the Palace of Fine Arts, stunning remains of the Panama Pacific Exposition of 1915, which celebrated the opening of the Panama Canal and its future impacts on California. From here it was a short pedal through quiet residential streets back to our motel. That evening, we cleaned up and celebrated our first day with dinner at Squat & Gobble, a quaint restaurant with lots of fresh choices. The next morning, we checked out of the motel early and made our way to our favorite relatively unknown restaurant on the waterfront, a mile south of AT&T Park. The Ramp restaurant is named for its proximity to a boat ramp sandwiched between a large industrial shipyard on the south and a lively commercial boat yard to the north. Looming over The Ramp is a huge Matson container ship, and another large Navy ship is entirely out of the water in drydock. After our early lunch, with The Ramp’s blessing, we left our vehicle in the parking lot and pedaled north towards AT&T Park. This route is almost entirely on bike trails and lanes apart from traffic and flat; it offers sightseers beautiful views of AT&T Park, commercial and Navy ships at nearby piers, San Francisco’s fireboat No. 1, public art along the Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge. We pedaled past the renovated old Ferry Building, alive with shops, restaurants and ferries arriving every 20 minutes or so, bound for Jack London Square in Oakland, Vallejo and other destinations. It’s a great place to grab coffee and a snack and watch people come and go amid the bustle of the ferry system. Just north is the Exploratorium on Pier 15, with hundreds of exhibits, always an adventure for kids or adults. Check out the Bay Observatory Gallery, offering the history and geography of the Bay. By mid-afternoon, we reached Pier 39, admired the tourist-friendly shops and eateries, then cranked back to our starting point. As for folding bike versus traditional bike, my pal, Steve, summed it up: “very comfortable, feels like riding a full-sized bike as long as you don’t look down to see the small wheels. Maneuverable, easy to get on and off, they took up very little space in a small trunk, very cleverly designed and constructed — a quality product. The challenge was the learning curve on collapsing and setting it up.” Certainly the folding bikes were easy to transport and easy to take on public transportation. If you aren’t into biking, you can take much of this waterfront tour by hopping aboard the Embarcadero trolley which connects AT&T Park north to Fisherman’s Wharf. Complete your waterfront tour with a snack from one of the many nearby eateries, then hop the trolley back to your starting place. Contact Tim Viall at tviall@msn.com.
