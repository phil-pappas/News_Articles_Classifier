That statistic was issued by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), whose chief Peter Cheese added: “The assumption that we will transition to a more productive, higher-value, higher-skilled economy just by increasing the conveyor belt of graduates is proven to be flawed.” He’s right, but what he’s saying isn’t new. A few years ago, the Association of Graduate Recruiters warned that “too many young people are left to graduate without vital employability skills” and argued that Tony Blair’s expansion of higher education was producing the opposite of its desired outcome: driving down standards, rather than boosting national performance.

But successive governments and education leaders seem to be in permanent denial of it. Why did anyone ever claim “widening participation” in higher education was a virtue, if it did not guarantee greater employability and long-term productive potential? To be fair to Blair, the trouble started with John Major’s 1992 decision to redesignate polytechnics as universities – encouraging them to offer “soft” degree courses in place of practical training. But it was Labour’s 50 per cent target, combined with Gordon Brown’s willingness to fund campus expansions, that really warped the system. It was about anti-elitism; it was about vote-winning among the aspirational middle class; and knowing the cynicism of New Labour, it was probably also about massaging youth unemployment numbers. But it was never about achieving the highest standards of excellence, or degree courses that would really lead to jobs.. The higher-ed participation rate duly rose from 38 per cent when Labour came to power to around 47 per cent when they left; today’s student population is around 2.3 million (slightly reduced since the introduction of the coalition’s student fee regime), of whom 700-800,000 graduate and seek work each year. If you want to become a high-paid graduate trainee in the financial sector, your chances are still far higher if you come from Oxbridge, the LSE or Imperial College London. If you studied a vocational subject such as medicine (human or veterinary), law or music, you have a career path ahead of you. People enter a job centre in Folkestone in southern England.

And with more students, the cachet of having been to university at all is reduced. No wonder dedicated humanities students are suffering too . If you really want to boost your employability, you need a further degree in something more practical. None of this is your own fault, of course, because it’s what your elders directed you to do with the promise that it would improve your life chances; and it hasn’t necessarily wrecked those chances, because statistics also tell us that only half the holders of senior jobs in the UK are graduates anyway. But if the policy of numbers-before-excellence is “proven to be flawed”, what is being done to deter youngsters from making bad choices? No universities have closed since the new fee regime came into effect, however poor their graduate employment record or weak their financial controls. As for departments threatened with closure, the subject area most often mentioned is modern languages, in which there were 6 per cent fewer students in 2012/13 than a decade earlier. If we want young people to conquer the commercial globe, isn’t it essential that they can make themselves understood? Even more worrying is the drop in numbers studying computer science, down by 34 per cent over a decade. Aha, says a chorus of complacent vice-chancellors, just look at the 15 per cent increase in students of “business and administrative studies”: well maybe, but undergraduate business education in this country has a low reputation. And the real test is whether it nurtures an appetite for entrepreneurship. Three years at university offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for intellectual and personal exploration. But you get out what you put in, and motivated students will always do well. Those who simply clamber on to the conveyor belt without a clear idea of where it might take them are ill-served by a sector that is far too complacent – and despite cuts, still too well fed – to recognise its own shortcomings and accept that less might be better. A searching review is needed, to address what amounts to a market failure that has devalued degrees and let the country down.
