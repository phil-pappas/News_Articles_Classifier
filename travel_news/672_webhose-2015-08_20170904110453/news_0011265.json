Airlines for America , a trade organization for the major American airlines, has forecast that 14.2 million Americans will fly during the holiday, up 3 percent over 2014. The holiday period is Sept. 2- 8, during which Friday, Sept. 4, will be the busiest. Most Americans plan to drive rather than fly, however. AAA Travel, which defines the Labor Day holiday as Sept. 3-7, says that 35.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from home over the final holiday of summer, the highest travel volume since 2008 and by a percent over last year. It says 86 percent of those will travel on the ground. FREE ON-TRAIN READING ON AMTRAK Passengers in the front of the train — in business and first classes — on East Coast Amtrak trains will have free access to digital editions of The New York Times and The Washington Post. The free unlimited access to the news sites is available on Acela and Northeast Regional lines, in addition to the Carolinian, Downeaster, Empire Service, Ethan Allen Express, Maple Leaf, Northeast Regional, Palmetto, Pennsylvanian and Vermonter trains.
