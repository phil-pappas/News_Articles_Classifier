While it is conveniently located near several family attractions, you may simply want to stay put and enjoy the pretty garden and a big, well-stocked kitchen, which make it ideal for summer or winter stays. Location: 8/10 The Chestnuts Opposite the pub in the centre of pretty Shilton, Chestnuts is just three miles south of Burford. Nearby attractions include the child-pleasing Cotswold Wildlife Park and the strangely compelling new Crocodiles of the World conservation centre. Style & character: 8/10 The honey-stone property dates from the 1850s, but two clever additions have turned it from a small cottage into a very chic house with four bedrooms, two sitting rooms (with sofa bed capacity) and a generous kitchen and dining room. The Chestnuts is ideal for mixed groups With plenty of space and scope for privacy, it’s ideal for mixed groups – teenagers, for example, can hole up in the smaller sitting room. There’s impressive attention to detail: owner Chris Burton lives in Australia and returns several times a year, staying in this and another holiday property, nearby Cull’s Cottage - so she tests things out, ensuring that the kitchen knives are sharp, that there are herbs in the garden, that the local literature is up scratch. The Chestnuts has won a string of awards for sustainable practices and is a terrific example of how eco-friendliness can be combined with luxury. Facilities: 9/10 When it’s cold, curl up by the wood burner in the main sitting room and play one of the board games supplied. When the weather is fair, the gravel garden has lots of outdoor seating and a barbecue. From a carefully selected library (not just cast-offs from former guests) to the kitchen’s cook books, to the generous provision of televisions in the bedrooms as well as the sitting rooms, and an ample supply of DVDs, there’s much in-house entertainment – this is a place to snuggle into. There’s a box of toys and games for children. High chairs and a stair gate can be supplied. The white decor shouldn’t daunt parents – this is the most practical paint colour to clean or patch, according to the owner. Free Wi-Fi. Value for money: 7/10 You could find cheaper accommodation in the area, but it would lack this style. Cottage from £598 per week in low season; rising to £1,750 in high (and £3,000 at Christmas). The Chestnuts: where you can relax in style Eating There’s no shop in the village; you need to drive five minutes to Huffkins in Burford for a pint of milk. Waitrose and Sainsbury’s are in Witney, 12 minutes away, or there is a Morrisons in Carterton, a seven-minute drive away. Eat out at the Rose & Crown opposite (much loved locally), the Burford Garden Centre deli or the nearby Swan, at Southrop. Access for guests with disabilities: The doorways are too narrow for wheelchairs. However guests with less limited mobility could stay on the ground floor, sleeping on a sofa bed and using the adjacent shower and loo.
