She said the strategy is expected to be implemented during the Ninth Five-Year Plan meeting to be held soon.The tourism industry is considered one of the key sectors in Oman's economic growth, where the objective of the strategy is to increase the sector's contribution to the Sultanate's GDP.She expected that the contribution of the tourism sector to the GDP will be between 2.6%-2.8%.Al Mahrouqi said, \"There is wide acceptance of both local and international investments in the tourism sector because there is a worldwide drive to invest in tourism, especially in the Gulf Cooperation Council.\"\"Oman has developed a series of initiatives, and with the basic infrastructure already prevalent it will be more attractive to investors,\" she added.Al Mahrouqi revealed that a company named 'Turathuna' or 'Our Culture' was created solely to take responsibility of cultural landmarks and locations. It is affiliated to Omran , Oman's tourism development company.Cultural management of some sites, such as old districts and forts, have been transferred to 'Turathuna' and will begin operations soon in co-ordination with Omran , the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Heritage and Culture. Hotel Prices When asked about hotel prices, Al Mahrouqi said, \"Hotel prices depend on supply and demand and changes depend on these conditions. This is known globally.\"She also added, \"The Minister of Tourism announced the launch of 1,500 hotel rooms a few days ago, and that will contribute to price regulation.\"She stressed that the ministry has invested heavily in the sector. While there are some challenges, it is not on a national scale, but in areas with major tourist attractions such as the Khareef Salalah.According to statistics from the National Centre of Statistics and Information (NCSI), the total revenue for hotels in the 3 to 5 star category last May logged a 1.5 per cent decline to reach OMR87,308,000 compared to OMR88,650,000 recorded during the same period in 2014.Furthermore, the occupancy rate recorded a 7.3 per cent decrease as it reached 62.7 per cent compared to 67.7 per cent during the same period of 2014.There were 991,000 tourists who visited the Sultanate until the end of May while 2,056,000 visitors left the country. Hotel guests numbered 499,646.In February a Spanish company called THR Innovative Tourism Advisors was awarded a contract to prepare a tourism strategy in co-ordination with the Ministry of Tourism. They conducted internal workshops to provide different proposals and models to develop tourism in the Sultanate.
