The standards cover nearly all aspects related to the marketing of a city, including governance, finance, human resources, sales, communications, destination development and research. The Dallas CVB was first awarded the DMAP seal in 2011 and has passed the rigorous four-year renewal process this year.\n“DMAP accreditation requires DMOs like the Dallas CVB to truly evaluate and define not only their policies and procedures, but also determine their guiding principles and solidify their importance to their communities in all they do,” said Jack Wert, DMAP Board Chair.\nThe Dallas CVB is one of more than 200 DMOs who have obtained DMAP recognition that demonstrate compliance across 16 disciplines, composed of 53 mandatory standards, and is globally recognized by the destination marketing industry as the highest achievement in destination excellence.\n“The Dallas CVB is honored to receive the Destination Marketing Accreditation renewal from DMAP,” said Phillip Jones, President and CEO of the Dallas CVB. “We are very pleased to be recognized in the destination marketing community for providing outstanding services in accordance with international standards and benchmarks in this field.”\n“We are pleased to have the Dallas CVB as part of our distinguished group. I look forward to their continued participation and influence as a part of the growing DMAP community,” added Valencia Bembry, Senior Vice President of Accreditation and Strategic Initiatives at DMAI.\nSource: Dallas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T13:39:34.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
