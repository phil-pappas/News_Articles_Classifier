The Travelers' Choice awards are selected on the basis of votes from the users of TripAdvisor. They reward the world's top attractions in 2015. NAUSICAA was rated 4.5 out of 5. \nNAUSICAA, the French National Sea Centre, is much more than just an aquarium; NAUSICAA is a unique discovery centre for the marine environment. It's fun, educational and scientific and it focuses mainly on the relationship between Man and the Sea. With 5,000 sq. metres of exhibition space, 36,000 animals (sea lions, sharks, African penguins, tropical fish etc.), gigantic aquariums, underwater exploration and the use of the latest hi-tech to create a magical, amazing setting, it has everything visitors could dream of. Since it first opened in 1991, NAUSICAA has had more than fourteen million visitors. It provides visitors with detailed information. It also has a specialist media library, films, short-term exhibitions, talks, teaching programmes and special exhibition events, again with the aim of increasing understanding and learning. In fact, the Centre's main purpose is to increase the general public's awareness of the need to manage the oceans and their resources. In 1999, NAUSICAA received the title of \"Centre of Excellence\" from UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission for its public awareness actions.
