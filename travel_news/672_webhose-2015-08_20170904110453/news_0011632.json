And at 3,000 kilometers wide, the Amazon is the greatest of all rainforests, known to many as the lungs of the world.\n“Thanks to this tower we’ll be able to better understand the role of the Amazon, its effect on the local climate and also on the global climate,” said Antonio Ocimar Manzi, one of the Brazilian scientists.\nFresh air\nRising far above even the mightiest Amazonian trees, the tower is a good place to swap the suffocating jungle heat for fresh air, as long as you don’t mind heights.\nWearing a safety harness is compulsory as journalists are led 150 meters up.\nThe observatory is the tallest of its kind, beating a similar structure known as ZOTTO in Russia’s Siberia region. And ATTO is in a geographical area that has come to symbolize the whole world’s struggle.\nGreenhouse gas emissions have rocketed since the second half of the 20th century, dangerously warming the globe, according to most scientists.\nRecommended: Costa Rican President Solís calls for regional bloc to push for climate change policy\nHealthy forests are one of the best ways to absorb the gasses. But deforestation for lumber or farming, a major issue in the Amazon, is a major cause of the gasses, since the stored up CO2 is released from the dead tree into the atmosphere.\nA worst case scenario predicted by some models foresees a vicious circle where global warming and drought kill so much of the Amazon that drought increases and the remains of the jungle became unsustainable, leading to even worse global warming.\n“The Amazon region is of global significance: it produces half of the word’s oxygen, impacts the water cycle through evaporation and stabilizes the climate,” the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry said.\nThe tower, which cost about $7.4 million and consists of 15,000 pieces, was inaugurated last week, but won’t collect data until later in the year.\nThe goal is to have ATTO, which links up with two smaller towers of 50 and 80 meters, running for 20 to 30 years to allow a longterm study of the effects of carbon gases. Its great height will be a big improvement on previous methods.\n“The 325 meters height allows the monitoring of an unprecedented atmospheric area of nearly 1,000 square kilometers,” the Brazilian government says.\n“This will fill holes in the monitoring and collection of data done by satellites and other instruments.”", "external_links": ["http://www.mpic.de/en/top-navigation/home.html", "http://portal.inpa.gov.br/"], "published": "2015-08-26T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:27:06.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
