Not yet, at least   \nAug 31, 2015 eTN   \nChina's currency devaluation and slowing economic growth have caused turmoil in world financial markets, but they have not really bothered Chinese tourists. Not yet, at least. \nA record 117 million Chinese traveled overseas in 2014, according to the Sydney-based Center for Asia-Pacific Aviation (CAPA) - more than double the 57 million in 2010 - and experts expect that trend to continue. \n\"The short-term outlook for Chinese outbound visitors remains strong and the long-term is bright,\" CAPA said in a report issued on Thursday. \nBeijing's surprise devaluation of its currency on August 11, which is now trading at a four-year low against the US dollar, has sparked fears China's big-spending tourists will start staying at home. \nBut businesses on the ground say more relaxed visa policies and the strength of the yuan against Asian currencies mean Chinese tourists will remain not only the most numerous, but also some of the biggest spenders. \n\"It's not uncommon for a Chinese VIP player to gamble well over a million US dollars per trip,\" said Aaron Fischer, regional head of consumer and gaming research at brokerage and investment group CLSA. \"There's probably 5,000 of them.\" \nAccording to Xinhua, Chinese tourists spent US$164.8 billion in 2014, a fourfold increase compared to 2008. A whopping 88 percent of that was on shopping, it said, citing the China Tourism Academy, a government agency. \nFischer predicted that the yuan's depreciation would not hinder Chinese from traveling but some may become more cost-conscious, particularly when it came to luxury items. \nIt is precisely that concern that is worrying organizations like the Indonesian Association of Travel Agencies. Its chairman Asnawi Bahar said the fear was that Chinese visitors, who number roughly one million visitors to the archipelago annually, would \"hold back on shopping and shorten their stay in Indonesia\". \nTrade bodies in a litany of other Asian countries from the Philippines to South Korea have expressed similar concerns. \nMany of them, however, are helped by the fact that their own currencies have fallen sharply. \nThe yuan is still at, or close to, two-year or longer highs against the currencies of tourist destinations like Japan, South Korea, Australia and the euro zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T03:04:40.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
