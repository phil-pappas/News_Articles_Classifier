Here is our introduction to the small, friendly resort. \nLa Rosiere is a charming little resort, perfect for those looking for exciting skiing holidays in France. Very different from the more glamorous and busy neighbouring resorts of Val Isère and Les Arcs, this quaint, quiet and very sunny village is particularly ideal for family skiing holidays in France. With a very traditional ambience, and situated high up on the road that leads to the Petit-St-Bernard pass, the village boasts some gorgeous Alpine chalets. In winter the road above the resort is closed, but in the summer you can continue on for another 8km and drive over into Italy. \nSkiing in La Rosiere \nAs the resort is south facing, the slopes are generally very sunny. Its proximity to Italy means that there is a nice mix of French and Italian skiing opportunities, and it is vary popular with first-time skiers because of this diversity. There are two main areas in the resort: La Rosiere centre and Les Eucherts. Both are well connected and you can travel between the two by bus or stroll along the picturesque forest path. \nThe ski area itself has good links to the resort of La Thuile and is centrally located in the Espace San Bernardo ski area, which has more than 160km of pisted runs. The runs leading back into the resort are mainly blue and green, which is part of the reason it is so suited to family skiing holidays inn France. For absolute beginners, La Rosiere has a few good ski schools to choose from. Lessons generally take place in the mornings, giving plenty of time to try out new skills with family or friends in the afternoons. \nBook With a Reputable Company \nIf you book with a reputable company that specialises in skiing holidays in France, you can experience something a different from a regular ski break. Consider one of the excellent adventure holiday specialists and you'll have the opportunity to try out some fantastic activities like ski touring, Nordic skiing, cross country skiing and even heli-skiing! Local guides will be there to help you every step of the way and because La Rosier is small and very local, the residents are welcoming and friendly, offering advice and help should you need it. \nAprès Ski \nSki holidays are about fun off the slopes as well as on, but the après ski scene in La Rosiere is certainly not for the lover of full on nightlife. Its family friendly emphasis means that there are not an abundance of nightclubs as in some of the other resorts. There are still some great lively bars, such as Le Petit Danois and Le Mckinley, but the emphasis is on quieter, more subdued entertainment.
