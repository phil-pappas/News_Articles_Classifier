He read physics and computer science at the University of Manchester and studied design, manufacturing and management at the University of Cambridge. He is the founder and chief technology officer of global mobile network company Truphone. I was called “the mad inventor” from the age of eight, so I always knew what I wanted to be. Successful inventors need broad-based knowledge, which is why I took a joint honours degree and studied manufacturing and management. I like having low-level knowledge – how transistors or radio waves work – and building on that. Starting out as an inventor is a bit like being in a rock band. You form a group, split up and re-form. I worked with someone else for a year but then set up my own company, Moonstone, to invent things on behalf of large companies, which was pretty much the only way to get funding in the Eighties. I owe my big break to Winnie-the-Pooh and rising damp. Someone wanted help developing a children’s talking book. We had invented a device to measure damp in walls and we found we could modify this to detect when somebody touched the book. Printed artwork proved very expensive so we thought we would use an LCD screen to display computer graphics. We replaced the printed circuit board with a piece of etched glass and invented the first zone-capacitive touchscreen. It is the technology used in 95 per cent of touchscreens today, from smartphones to airline check-ins. The best way to make money from an invention is to build a company to make it, so I did. Big technology companies rarely pay a lot for an idea. They prefer a working product. That means you may only get three or four chances at a big invention in a lifetime because it can take a decade or more to turn them into products. I’ve probably invented about 300 things but most weren’t great. There was a radio for the Psion Organiser that never took off, and candles containing copper sulphate that burned with a blue flame. And we invented a vehicle reversing sensor but used the wrong technology – capacitors instead of ultrasound. That could have been very lucrative if we’d got it right. My second big success stemmed from a personal need. I live on a farm in Kent and 15 years ago we had no mobile coverage. We took out patents involving Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, but over time we found that Wi-Fi users tend to be international travellers, and the idea morphed into a SIM card that lets users operate different phone numbers from a single device in many countries. Successful inventors need lots of skills – not just technical but legal (to deal with patents and intellectual property) and commercial (to get their invention to market). So if you want to be an inventor, do lots of stuff outside your degree. Play with a Raspberry Pi, go to conferences and hackathons. I read The Economist for 30 years to learn about the macroeconomics that might create markets for new technology. The broader your knowledge, the better.
