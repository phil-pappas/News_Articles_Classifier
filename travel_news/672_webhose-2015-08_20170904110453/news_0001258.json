Dubai has marketed itself so well that people from the western world know where we are actually located. There were times when people thought we are next to Iraq and maybe an area where bomb attacks are normal,” he said. \nKaran Anand, head of relationships at travel company Cox & Kings, said that unrest in the Mena region “has not deterred tourists from traveling to these three destinations [Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman] as they feel it is secure.” \nNegligible effect \nHowever, some international travelers are discouraged from visiting the GCC but their numbers are “so low”, said Nikola Kosutic, research manager at consultancy Euromonitor International. \n“The unrest in the region has a negligible effect on tourism in the GCC because the majority of travelers are from neighbouring countries. They are well educated about what’s safe and what’s not … the crime rates in these countries are low,” Kosutic said. \nWhile the GCC is viewed as a safe region, it has faced a series of security incidents in recent months. \nThe bombing of a mosque in Saudi Arabia’s Asir province on Thursday, which killed at least 15 people, is the latest in a spate of attacks on mosques in the kingdom. \nEarlier this summer, Shia mosques in the kingdom and Kuwait were attacked during Friday prayers. \nIn the UAE, authorities said last week that they plan to try 41 people on charges of setting up a terrorist organization. \nAnalysts said that the incident is unlikely to discourage holidaymakers from visiting the country. \n“I think there is no major impact. It is an isolated case,” Kosutic said. \nInbound tourism to the GCC continues to grow, said Christopher Hewett, senior consultant at TRI Consulting. \nWider market \n“Although some specific markets such as Jordan, Lebanon and to a lesser extent Egypt continue to face challenges from their proximity to unrest, the wider market is witnessing continued growth in visitors, particularly Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha,” he said. \nSingh said that the unrest in the Mena region means that travelers will choose to visit the GCC nations since they are safer options. \n“Whenever there are incidents of unrest in the region we get the most benefit,” he said. \nTravel company Thomas Cook said last month that the terrorist attack on a resort in Tunisia in June and the Greek debt crisis will reduce profit by roughly £25 million (Dh142 million) this year. Since then, the company has cancelled all holidays to the North African country until the end of October. \nDubai welcomed 13.2 million visitors in 2014, up 8.2 percent compared to the previous year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:15:23.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
