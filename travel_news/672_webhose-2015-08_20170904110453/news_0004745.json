The 2014 PWC TCA Rookie of the Year earned pole position and led both races from start to finish, retaking the lead in the 2015 TCA Driver Championship standings. Only a broken halfshaft in Saturday's round 12 prevented him from making a clean sweep of the weekend.\n\"As a driving instructor here when I'm not racing, I am very familiar with this track, so I've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time,\" said Wolfe, who has six podium finishes on the year, including three wins. \"Once I got the pole position in qualifying, some of the pressure went away, but I knew I had to win here or else I'd never hear the end of it from my family, friends and fellow instructors. The Kia Forte Koup performed flawlessly, and the Kinetic Motorsports crew gave me a great car as always. All I had to do was execute, and we were able to do that.\"\nMeanwhile, Wolfe's Kinetic Motorsports teammate, Kris Wright , in the No. 34 Wright Automotive Kia Forte Koup, finished in the top five in rounds 10 and 11, narrowly missing his first podium of the season with a hard-fought fourth-place result in round 11.
