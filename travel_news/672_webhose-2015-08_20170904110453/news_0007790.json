A member of Star Alliance, it has the youngest fleet in Europe and continues to invest in new aircrafts. Turkish Airlines operates scheduled flights to a total of 280 destinations – 230 international and 50 domestic. Skytrax named Turkish Airlines in 2015 as the “Best Airline in Europe” for the fifth year running. Turkish Airlines also received “World’s Best Business Class Airline Catering”, “World’s Best Business Class Lounge” and “World’s Best Business Class Lounge Dining” awards in 2015.\nPATA CEO Mario Hardy said, “It gives me great pleasure to personally welcome Turkish Airlines to PATA as our newest aviation member. As a PATA member, Turkish Airlines now has the ability to connect with our extensive network of members and receive our in-depth research and insights into the Asia Pacific region, thus allowing them to stay competitive in capturing market share of the rapidly growing Asia Pacific market.”\nAccording to PATA, international visitor arrivals (IVAs) to the Asia Pacific region are forecast to reach well above the 672 million mark by 2019, with 49 million IVAs from European source markets.\nTurkish Airlines CEO Dr. Temel Kotil added, “Turkish Airlines’ membership to PATA will ensure that our company, today flying to more countries than any other airline in the world, will grow day by day in its ability to realize the most of the potential in Asia Pacific market. I believe, as a PATA member, we will now have a better chance to build a stronger connection and a direct interaction with the stakeholders in Asia Pacific, including airlines and other aviation institutions, to address the challenges faced by growing companies like us. Turkish Airlines, thus, remains determined to continue to increase its operations, strengthen its effectiveness and improve its visibility and representation in the competitive environment of the region.”\nSource: PATA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:28:29.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
