James Cave Staff Writer, Lifestyle, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/20/2015 09:25 AM EDT | Edited: 4 minutes ago \nWhat more can be said about coffee? A lot, it turns out. \nEurope will import 44.5 million bags this year , and drinkers in the U.S. will spend $40 billion on it . You love it, we love it. People all around the world love it, no matter how they drink it -- or how weird it can get. ( Egg yolk and cognac ? Ok, we'll give it a shot.) \nAs varied and delicious as coffee drinks can get around the world, there's still one thing that unites us: no matter where we are, we can always depend on it to bring us back from the dead every morning. \nIn case you haven't had it in Spain (the cafe bombón is delicious), or anywhere other than Starbucks, here are some of our favorite global selections. Germany: Pharisäer \nThe Germans know how to warm up a cup of coffee: sneak two ounces of rum in it . Mix dark coffee, rum and sugar to taste, and top it with whipped cream . Vietnam: Egg Coffee oh contraire/Flickr \nThis decadent coffee is more like a full-on dessert: beat two egg yolks with a half teaspoon each of condensed milk, honey and vanilla extract until fluffy. Pour into a cup and top with hot black Vietnamese coffee . The egg mixture will float to the top, where you can spoon it into your mouth or drink right away. USA: Gibraltar niallkennedy/Flickr \nMany an Instagram feed has been filled with pictures of this espresso drink. Legend is that it started when San Franciscan baristas wanted to shoot a latte mid-shift and get back to work: a double shot of espresso is topped with a shot of steamed milk (and served in a Gibraltar glass), just enough to cool the espresso for a quick gulp. Spain: Cafe Bombón \nThis popular Spanish coffee is for those who like it sweet . Mix equal parts strong coffee with sweetened condensed milk . Turkey: Turkish Coffee Michael Sugrue via Getty Images \nIt's said every Turkish family has its own recipe for this tradition. Super-finely ground coffee is brewed in a copper pot called a cezve , sweetened and boiled several times over heat . It's kind of complicated, but well worth the work. Here's how it's done . France: Cafe au Lait ?? ?? via Getty Images \nTraditional cafe au laits are essentially equal parts brewed coffee and steamed milk. To spice it up, we like to add chicory, like they do at New Orleans' Cafe du Monde . Mexico: Cafe de Olla moverelbigote/Flickr \nTranslated in English to \"pot coffee,\" cafe de olla is a sweetened, spiced coffee popular in Mexico . Bring dark-roasted, ground coffee to a slow boil in a saucepan with a quart of water, cinnamon stick, orange peel and dark brown sugar . When the sugar is dissolved, let steep for five minutes before straining into a cup. Italy: Espresso Romano Kuzmik_A via Getty Images \nItalians often serve their espresso with a slice of lemon on the side -- the sweeter notes of the espresso are said to be highlighted by the citrus when you rub the inside rim of your glass with the lemon . New Zealand & Australia: Flat White \nSimilar to a Gibraltar, the flat white is made with a double shot of espresso and just a little more steamed milk to straddle the line between cappuccino and full-blown latte. Greece: Frappé Eric A. Peacock via Getty Images \nFrappés are iced coffee drinks made with instant coffee, sugar and water whisked into a foam , invented by a Nescafé marketer in 1957 and is now one of the most popular ways to drink coffee in Greece. Mix a teaspoon of instant coffee with a teaspoon of sugar, mix with a frappe blender until it's a solid foam and add ice and water. Austria: Kaisermelange Peter Wilson via Getty Images \nThe kaisermelange (or \"emperor's blend\") is popular Austrian way of drinking dark coffee , served with an egg yolk, sugar and cognac . Some people blend the yolk with sugar and maybe a little milk. \nAlso on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:34:46.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
