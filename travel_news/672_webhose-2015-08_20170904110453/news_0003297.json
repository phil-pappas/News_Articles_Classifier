I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Miss Andrea DeMarco, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Miss DeMarco, ease proceed. Andrea DeMarco (Director - IR): Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow with commentary on the results for the quarter, as well as provide updated guidance for 2015 before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com, and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover just a few items. Our press release with second-quarter 2015 results was issued this morning, and is available on our Investor Relations website. I'd also like to review information about forward-looking statements, and the use of non-GAAP information as a part of this call. The Company's comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the Company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and will undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the Company's SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the Company's earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio (President): Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. The overall theme for the second quarter of 2015 is that the various initiatives that we've shared with you over the past few months have taken hold and are bearing strong positive results. As I mentioned on our last call, our first full quarter as a combined Company, our priorities were twofold. First was ensuring that we came out of the gates strong in our first combined quarter to save positive tone for the newly combined Company. On that front, we can say mission accomplished as we posted strong earnings for Q1. Second, and perhaps most importantly, was building the foundation to successfully bring the Norwegian and Prestige organizations together under one company. We created a motto for all stakeholders to rally around. Three distinct brands. One incredible Company. This motto formed the basis for how we structured our organization. On one side are brand champions, focused on stimulating demand to drive yields through sales and marketing initiatives. On the other, are areas with centralized responsibilities. Including vessel operations, supply chain, revenue management and finance. All of which focus on maximizing our resources and capital allocation to drive further synergies and efficiencies. This flat organizational structure is one of Norwegian's main differentiators in the cruise space. Another differentiator is our portfolio of brands. Position in the contemporary, upper premium, and luxury segments of the market, there's minimal overlap among them. Meaning, we do not compete against ourselves in the marketplace. All in all, we believe that our organizational structure and brand mix, both of which are unique in the cruise industry, our core strengths that are and will continue to deliver outside dividends in the future. 1 of 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:54:47.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
