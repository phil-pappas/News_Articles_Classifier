The town is hosed down minutes after the event ends at noon, while participants can use public showers.\nThe paid-entry event was inspired by a food fight between local children in 1945 in the tomato-producing region.\nReflecting its worldwide popularity, Google dedicated its search engine doodle to the fiesta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T15:44:06.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
