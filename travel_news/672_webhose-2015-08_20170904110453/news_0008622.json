They were located under the mid-deck in a non-visible area. Our Endeavour Space Shuttle exhibit , the part that is on view to the public, remains exactly as it was before and continues its mission to inspire curiosity and science learning,\" said Science Center President and CEO Jeffrey Rudolph . During the removal process the shuttle attracted former Endeavour astronauts Drew Feustel and Mark Kelly , who was joined by former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. This was the first time Mark Kelly had been inside the shuttle since he was Commander of Endeavour's final mission in 2011. The shuttles were designed to be reused. Endeavour's water tanks have approximately 75 percent of design-life remaining since the shuttle only flew 25 of the 100 missions anticipated. The only major non-reusable part of the shuttle launch configuration is the External Tank. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T03:03:12.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
