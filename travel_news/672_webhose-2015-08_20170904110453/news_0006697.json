Visitors can get involved in hands-on farming activities: Be a Farmer for a Day. \nHere children and adults who are young at heart can roll their sleeves up and sample the rural idyll. Seasonal activities include: baking bread, making goat’s cheese, treading grapes and shearing sheep. The day is always rounded off with a beautiful Cretan dinner, alfresco at The Farm Taverna (voted best farm restaurant by Vanity Fair). As identified by The Telegraph, ‘Crete's southerly location gives it the longest growing season in Greece. It produces a surfeit of edible goods’. It is also the most southerly of the Greek islands making it ideal for a late summer break. As well as numerous activities and supplying organic produce to all of the Grecotel properties, Agreco Farm also produces a premium collection of organic beauty care, Eau de Grece. Close to the farm and launched in May, Caramel boutique resort oozes eccentric luxury combined with exceptional Cretan service. The resort runs along the longest beach in Crete, minutes away from Rethymno’s Venetian harbour. Caramel resort has been listed in the Top 100 Best Holidays of 2015 in The Sunday Times. Be a Farmer for a day costs €52 for adults (including transport from local hotels); children: 6-12 years - 50% reduction; under 6 – free. Double rooms at Caramel by Grecotel starts at €245 (B&B) Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:20:22.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
