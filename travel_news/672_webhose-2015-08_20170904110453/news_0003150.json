Anyone who has ever played a wind instrument will probably recognize the town's name as the same one engraved in the bell of their Conn trumpet or on the label of their Selmer clarinet. Elkhart also has many recreational vehicle manufacturers and is known as the RV Capital of the World (maybe even the Universe, so take that, Pluto). It seems only appropriate, then, that they would be home to the RV/MH Hall of Fame (the RV stands for recreational vehicle and the MH is for manufactured home). Formerly in smaller quarters downtown, the RVMHHOF now sits in palatially digs mere seconds off of Interstates 80 and 90 in north central Indiana. Inside is a dazzling historical array of all things trailer: you've got your Airstreams, you've got your Shastas, and don't even get me started on the Winnebagos. The vintage \"cans\" are complete with period interiors you can poke your head into to drink up the retro atmosphere. In the very early two-lane days of roadside travel, having your own hard-shelled home on wheels to dryly bed down in must have seemed like the lap of luxury. Today's astounding variety of RVs have surpassed that generation's wildest dreams. And there really is a Hall with lots of Fame in it. Scores of framed pictures of those with the right stuff to be so honored by such a prestigious organization line the walls. Any fan of road trips would find the RVMHHOF a worthy stop, and not just for a bathroom break. Happy trailers to you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T08:18:41.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
