While only 30 percent are today in pristine condition.\nThe campaign aims to cover 100 hectares of Indonesia’s seabed with 1 million new coral seedlings in 51 locations and 243 spots. By the end of July already 30 hectares were planted with 400,000 seedlings along many shorelines.\nThe initiative of Indonesia’s Marine Corps under Commander Major General (Navy) Buyung Lalana, the campaign has taken national proportions, galvanizing the active participation of fishing communities, local residents and scuba divers alike.\nThe culmination of this campaign took place simultaneously on Saturday, 15 August, with highlight at Weh island in Aceh in Indonesia’s west, Manado in the north, and Ambon in east Indonesia , while elsewhere on Java’s, Sumatra’s and Kalimantan seas similar coral planting took place at the same time. This unique underwater event was aired through SCTV, the first ever simultaneous underwater event ever aired “live” in the world.\nWhile from Jakarta’s Merdeka Palace, president Joko Widodo formally launched the Coral planting campaign. In his speech President Joko Widodo reminded the nation that for Indonesia to emerge as a maritime nation, three pillars must be strengthened. Indonesians, in particular maritime human resources, must rekindle and possess that maritime spirit of yore; Indonesia’s ocean resources must be managed professionally, and eco-friendly maritime infrastructure to be built in full coordination and partnership among all related stakeholders.\nThe contour of the seabeds where the corals were planted differed from one another. At Pulau Weh in Aceh over 200 divers placed prepared coral seedling along a flat but sloping sandy seabed, planting these in the shape of a tank. While along the Malalayang Shore near Manado, North Sulawesi, Marine Commander Major General Buyung Lalana led hundreds of enthusiastic divers comprising marines and scuba divers in planting corals along a similar flat seabed. Whereas in Ambon, led by Governor of Ambon, Said Assagaf, corals were planted on a steep surface ranging between 9 – 12 meters below the surface of the sea. In order to lead this campaign, Governor Assagaf has had to take special dive lessons.\nSource:-Tourism Indonesia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:32:44.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
