It closes in the winter. Two years ago at least 1,200 people showed up on opening day, March 1.\nThe temperature was 11 below zero.\nWhy? Tradition, generous portions, reasonable prices and treats you just can’t get at most other shops. In an era of corporate ubiquity, it’s a subtle reminder that sometimes different can be delicious.\nDiann Mikula, 78, has been visiting the shop since it opened. Along with her husband, she continues to make almost daily pilgrimages there, even though there are other DQs across the river in Fargo, N.D., where she lives.\n“They don’t even need an inside place to eat like they have in Fargo,” Mikula said. “They are good to their customers. They are so generous with their product. They don’t skimp on what they put in your treats.”\nWhile newer contracts stipulate adherence to strict corporate guidelines, messaging and menus, the Moorhead shop still operates mostly under the terms of a 1949 contract. That allows owners Troy and Diane DeLeon to dish out what might be considered rogue menu items.\nThere’s the Mr. Maltie, a chocolate malt on a stick; the Monkey Tail, a chocolate-covered frozen banana; and of course the Chipper Sandwich, which is vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies and dipped in chocolate.\nThe DeLeons also offer unique toppings, some of which have been discontinued by headquarters, as well as food items not approved by corporate headquarters, including barbecue sandwiches and Polish sausages.\n“If we changed to the new corporate way, virtually all our food items would be gone,” said Troy DeLeon, who took over the store in 1995 from original owner Bob Litherland. “The corporate way is everything exactly the same.”\nDeLeon has said that corporate would like for his store to melt away, which drew a chuckle and a “no comment” from company spokesman Dean Peters. The Minneapolis-based chain, which launched in 1940, values all of its more than 6,500 locations, Peters said, and it “understands and appreciates” the heritage and popularity of the downtown Moorhead Dairy Queen.\nMind you, the Moorhead store still plays the corporate game, to a degree. The lineup of typical DQ treats is featured on the window; nearby is a “Local Menu” sign that includes a Nathan’s hot dog for $1.50, a bowl of chili for $2, a large Polish sausage for $2.75 and the super chili cheese dog for $4.\nPeters said a small percentage of Dairy Queen stores around the country have older contracts that allow for “very limited” products to be sold that are not available at most locations.\nCustomers at the DeLeons’ restaurant are welcome, if not encouraged, to order treats just the way they like them. For example, Moorhead mayor Del Rae Williams said her son likes the Crunch Blizzard, but made with chocolate ice cream.\n“We’ll do whatever. It doesn’t take any longer,” DeLeon said.\nHe said he has been encouraged by corporate lawyers to enter into a new contract, but there “aren’t enough zeroes” that could convince him to dump the flavors and feelings customers like Diann and Leroy Mikula have enjoyed for decades.\n“They come here almost every day, like a lot of customers,” he said. “We want people to take a step back in time and experience something they don’t get a chance to experience very often.”\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T05:17:45.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
