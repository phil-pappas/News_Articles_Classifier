The engaging four-minute video features over 30 Hawaiian Airlines crew members and their family members who relay important safety information as they take guests on a journey to their favorite locations throughout the Hawaiian Islands. \nDebuting on all of Hawaiian Airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, the video offers breathtaking footage of world-famous destinations such as Yokohama Beach and Kualoa Ranch on Oʻahu; Haleakala National Park and Po'olenalena Beach on Maui; Waimea Canyon and Waikoko Farm on Kauaʻi; and Saddle Road Lava Fields and Umauma Falls on Hawaiʻi Island. \n\"Safety is paramount at Hawaiian Airlines, and we are pleased to share with our guests a more creative and informative in-flight video as they journey to their favorite island destination,\" said Alisa Onishi, director – brand management and development for Hawaiian Airlines. \"Casting our pilots and flight attendants allowed us to deliver our safety message while capturing each employee in their element, doing what they love, sharing their personal stories and favorite places with our guests.\" \nRadasha Ho'ohuli, a flight attendant with Hawaiian for three years and a hula dancer since the age of 7, provides a visual interpretation of the safety instructions. \n\"I love when guests ask me where my favorite places to go are because I know they're really looking for a unique and memorable experience,\" Ho'ohuli said. \nFlight attendant Valerie Akiona, who spends her free time hiking, is seen trekking the slopes of Haleakala with her husband – also a Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant – and two children. \n\"Most of us (flight attendants) grew up with this amazing landscape as our playground,\" Akiona said. \"It's instilled in us to not only malama 'aina (take care and nurture the land), but also enjoy it with our friends, family and guests.\" \nAkiona went on to say, \"I want people to watch and listen to the safety instructions, but I also really hope when they watch it, they say, 'Hey, where is that? I'd love to go there,' knowing that they absolutely can make that a part of their trip.\" \nThe video, conceptualized and creatively developed by Honolulu-based Anthology Marketing Group, and produced by Kinetic Productions, is subtitled in five different languages including Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and English.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:45:02.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
