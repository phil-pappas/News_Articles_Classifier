Sporting ambition and the desire to overcome tough challenges were what made the participants at Red Bull 400 manage the toughest 400 meters of their lives – up the runout, the jump-off platform and the inrun, covering more than 140 meters in altitude difference with an incline of 35 degrees up to the belay at the top. \nRed Bull 400 – the toughest 400 meters in the world – made its debut on the 25th of July 2015 in Germany. The legendary Black Forest Hochfirstschanze in Titisee-Neustadt, from which the world elite of ski jumpers fly downhill in winter, was taken by storm from the opposite direction this summer. At Red Bull 400 it’s not just sturdy calves that are needed, but also stamina and the willingness to really push one’s boundaries. Jeep® is the official mobility partner of Red Bull Events in Germany and is present at selected extreme sports events. While the participants of Red Bull 400 were fighting for victory, the spectators could enjoy a much more comfortable challenge: at the Jeep® Offroad-Parcours they could test the off road abilities of the newest Jeep® models. For an optimal positioning, exciting accompanying actions and professional car handling, Jeep® trusted the events and automobile expertise of the agency VOK DAMS. For the team of the Frankfurt-based VOK DAMS office, Titisee-Neustadt was the beginning of a wonderful friendship within the cooperation of Jeep® Red Bull, which will continue for at least four more events. The next joint event on schedule is the island triathlon Red Bull Tri Islands, which will take place on the 16th of August, and which covers the islands Amrum, Föhr and Sylt.
