Liz Kendall warned that things remain “fragile” in the country and said the party must elect someone who understands the “difficult issues” that still exist. Mr Corbyn caused outrage in the weeks after the Brighton bombing in 1984 by inviting Mr Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to the Commons. He also observed a minute’s silence in 1987 for eight IRA members killed by the SAS in an ambush. Last month he was pictured in Parliament with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein leaders. Speaking to the Birmingham Mail , Ms Kendall warned that a perception that Mr Corbyn was sympathetic to the IRA would make it harder to maintain peace in Northern Ireland. “There are still huge issues and concerns, and we always need to have a leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister who are absolutely even handed in the way that they deal with the situation, who people feel they can trust,” she said. “And I know there are many people who have concerns about where Jeremy Corbyn has stood in the past on that. “And things remain fragile. Difficult issues come up all the time. “I want to make sure we have a Labour leader who is trusted in this process, and understands the difficult issues that remain.” It comes after an interview with BBC Radio Ulster in which Mr Corbyn was repeatedly challenged to condemn the IRA's actions. Mr Corbyn responded: \"I condemn all bombing, it is not a good idea, it is terrible what happened.\" Asked again if he condemned the IRA, Mr Corbyn responded: \"Look I condemn what was done by the British Army as well as the other sides as well. What happened in Derry in 1972 [Bloody Sunday] was pretty devastating as well.\" Asked a final time if he condemns the IRA, Mr Corbyn replied \"I feel we will have to take this up later you know\" before his phone cut out because of a bad signal. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T15:17:31.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
