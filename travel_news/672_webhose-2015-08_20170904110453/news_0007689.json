The Burlington, Ont. and Toronto -based pair struggled at the flight plan challenge, opting to take a two-hour penalty, and then faced some difficulty at the trampoline challenge. Neil and Kristin were the fourth team to reach the Pit Stop at Wanuskewin Lookout Point in Saskatoon , but because they were forced to wait out their time penalty, were checked in last by host Jon Montgomery and eliminated from the race. \"You make good calls… sometimes it works for you and sometimes it doesn't,\" said Neil. \"This race was a total dream come true and being able to do it with him just made it twice as much fun and twice as easy,\" added Kristin. \"Team Lumsden out.\" **Media Note** To download artwork for THE AMAZING RACE CANADA please visit BellMediaPR.ca Episode 307 Recap The seven remaining teams travelled nearly 2,000 kilometres from Sudbury, Ontario to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan . Once in Saskatoon , teams had to create a flight plan from a list of Air Canada destinations, all with various destinations, time zones, and flight lengths. Teams were tasked with choosing three flights totalling exactly 25 hours of flight time. Brent and Sean decided to use their Express Pass, while Neil and Kristin and Leilani and Dujean took time penalties. At the Road Block, racers had to bounce their way through three high-flying tasks at the Apex Trampoline Park. Then, at the Great Western Brewery, one of Canada's most successful regional breweries, teams had to search for fifteen original beer bottle caps in a bin of hundreds of other bottle caps. At the Detour, teams chose between Nimitook or Mikwap. In Nimitook, teams had to perform a traditional Native hoop dance, while at Mikwap, they had to build an exact replica of a traditional tipi. Brothers Brent and Sean arrived first at the Pit Stop at Wanuskewin Lookout Point, winning the leg. It was a special moment for Brent, who was celebrating his birthday. Host Jon Montgomery greeted them with their leg prize - round-trip tickets from Air Canada to Paris, France , plus 5 million Petro-Points from Petro-Canada.
