The mother is a Hastings, Minnesota, native and has been talking to the station about her ordeal.\nMcCullough told the station Hannah is alive but in critical condition. The TV station did not report on the fate of twin Olivia, who was not expected to survive.\nIn this Aug. 25, 2015 photo provided by KUSA-TV, expectant mother Amber McCullough is pictured during an interview with Colorado's KUSA-TV, a day before she was to give birth to conjoined twins in Aurora, Colo. McCullough, of Hastings, Minn., was scheduled to deliver twin girls at the Colorado Fetal Care Center at Children's Hospital Colorado by C-section on Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015. Hospital officials said Wednesday they had no update on the surgery. (KUSA-TV Photo via AP) Children's Hospital Colorado said Thursday morning it could not confirm that the birth had happened.\nThe twins shared an abdomen, liver and intestinal tract. The girls had separate hearts and kidneys.\n\"I would like everyone to know, and for the message to be read that Hannah did survive the surgery. However, she is very critical and very delicate,\" McCullough wrote the station.\nMcCullough earlier said that Olivia was not expected to survive because of her heart. She only had a single ventricle and was missing valves.\nConjoined twins happen once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center, which says between 40 to 60 percent arrive stillborn.\nMcCullough said she spent eight years in the U.S. Army, then went to law school and is now an attorney. She has a 6-year-old son named Tristan from a previous relationship that ended in divorce. She said her son is moving to Denver to be with her soon.\nShe became pregnant with her girls during another relationship, and it wasn't until her second trimester when she learned she was carrying conjoined twins. The relationship with the girls' dad ended shortly thereafter.\nMcCullough has lived at the Ronald McDonald House in Aurora since early August. Her stepmother is there, keeping her company and caring for her.", "external_links": ["http://kare11.tv/1IkwlUB).", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/27/52/11/1cb5c5527b60429eb58a4e1e124a11df-ab29b0d34ce74ea2906894b0ee169be9-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-27T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:44:37.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
