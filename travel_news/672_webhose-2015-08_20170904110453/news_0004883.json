Pictures of Cagbalete Island, Borawan Beach, and Putting Buhangin flood Facebook feeds and in the discussion of beach destinations near the city. The province, however, is more than just a quick beach getaway for those who are interested in history. Quezon is home to many ancestral homes and churches that are decades, or even centuries old. Here are a few of your must-see cultural and religious landmarks:\nTAYABAS BASILICA\nThe Tayabas Basilica harkens back to the halcyon days of the Spanish conquistadors. The first church is not what it was as you see today, a towering, key-shaped structure. Materials such as kawayan, nipa, and anahaw marked the humble beginnings of the church in 1580.\nThe church underwent several restorations and enhancements over centuries to become the biggest church in the province. This national cultural treasure follows the Baroque style. It is one of the most beautiful churches, not just in the province but also in the country. The church’s exterior may be old, but it is quite charming and displays Spanish influence in Southern Tagalog.\nLUCBAN CHURCH\nLucban’s beginnings date all the way back to the late 1500s when the Franciscan friars first established it. It comes as no surprise that one of the Philippines’ oldest churches is in the district. The Lucban Church was first built in 1595, and then later ruined in 1629. The reconstruction of the church took place in 1630 until 1640, but a fire in 1733 severely damaged the church. The restoration of the church, the church you see now, was completed in 1738.\nThe church’s stone façade and Baroque architecture takes visitors back to the days when Spanish friars roamed the streets of the province. The Lucban church plays a prominent role during the town’s festive Pahiyas Festival. The mass early in the morning of May 15 every year, marks the beginning of the festival. There are also several old houses lining the streets of Lucban leading to the church. The colorful decorations on these old houses each year mark the celebration of the Pahiyas Festival.\nSARIAYA CHURCH\nThe Saint Francis of Assisi Parish Church, more commonly known as the Church of Sariaya, traces its roots to 1599, when it was first built. The second church was later constructed in 1605, later replaced by a third church in 1641.\nThe town and church moved to Lumangbayan in 1703. The flooding and earthquakes devastated the church and the town led to the transfer of the people and the church to its present location. The construction of the church you see today took place in 1746.\nSARIAYA HERITAGE HOUSES\nAside from the historical churches, Quezon is home to impressive ancestral houses that date back several decades. The barons benefited from the booming demand for oil extracted from copra during the early 1900s. The rich coconut barons of Quezon displayed their wealth and prominence through elaborate stone houses.\nThe Natalio Marquez Mansion situated beside the Church of Sariaya is the most beautiful of them all. Its twin spires and castle-like exterior are unique and attractive amid the hustle and bustle, and traffic of the area. Andres Luna de San Pedro, son of Juan Luna, designed this ancestral home.\nThe Don Catalino Rodriguez ancestral home, commonly known as Villa Sariaya, was constructed in 1922. The house’s stone and brick features typified the Bahay na Bato in the 19th century. The grand and elaborate staircase greets visitors as they make their way to the entrance.\nThe Gala-Rodriguez ancestral house is a heritage house because of its cultural and historical significance. Dr. Juan Nakpil designed the home. It was owned by one of the most prominent couples in the province, Gregoria Gala and Dr. Isidro Rodriguez. Dr. Rodriguez had the mansion built in the 1930s as a gift for his sick wife. The Japanese later used this Art Deco house as one of their headquarters in the province. American bombings on the province threatened to destroy the house, but it managed to remain intact.\nThere are other beautiful ancestral homes lining the streets of Sariaya, but the National Historical Institute only selected a handful as heritage houses.\nThe ancestral homes and centuries-old churches in Quezon make it not only a beach destination, but also a trip worth taking to discover the rich past of Southern Tagalog.\nCASA DE COMUNIDAD\nThe Casa de Comunidad is a prominent stone structure in Tayabas. The original building built in 1776 used lightweight materials and acted as a tribunal for the Spaniards. The new gobermadorcillo, Don Diego Enriquez, had the entire building renovated using stone in 1831. The Japanese later used the stone house as a stronghold during World War II. Hermano Pule died by firing squad within the walls of Casa de Comunidad because he fought for religious equality and freedom.\nThe casa has a museum and gallery where visitors get a glimpse of Quezon’s rich past and culture. Get to see antique stone pieces, pictures of prominent people in Tayabas, and traditional dresses. Take a swig of lambanog, a local alcoholic drink, as you buy locally made products inside the stone house.
