Some of the performances with his band, the Experience, were caught on film, the live footage later appearing in such movies as “Jimi Plays Berkeley” and “Rainbow Bridge.” Now another previously unreleased show has been unearthed from the archives and is set for release; Hendrix’s Fourth of July appearance at the Atlanta International Pop Festival.\nThis album “Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival,” which presents Hendrix’s set in its entirety, comes out this week; a documentary of the performance and the festival, “Jimi Hendrix: Electric Church,” airs on Showtime at 9 p.m. Sept. 4 (a DVD release with additional footage is scheduled for late October).\n It’s a strong performance by Hendrix, leading a revamped Experience (featuring original Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell and longtime friend Billy Cox on bass), mixing classics like “Purple Haze” with songs that had yet to be released, such as “Room Full of Mirrors.”\nThe documentary seeks to put the festival in the context of the era. Despite its name, the festival wasn’t held in Atlanta, but 100 miles south, in the “sleepy little town” (as a local puts it) of Byron, which was completely overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of attendees who arrived for the three-day event (crowd estimates ranged from 200,000 to 500,000).\nThe locals turned up to gawk at the “hippies — real hippies!” who wandered around naked and openly took drugs, while law enforcement was forced to rely on a biker gang to provide a modicum of security. Those who turned up without tickets simply tore down the perimeter fence to gain entry. As Steve Rash, the film’s director, ruefully admits, the event was “unorganized, because everything was out of control.”\nBut there was nothing disorganized about Hendrix’s sharp set, which included a furious rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” played for an encore as fireworks lit up the sky, to the cheering delight of the audience.\nHis fingers are seen in close-up, flying across his guitar’s fretboard as he drops in improvisational flourishes into most songs, smiling shyly at the reception he receives after each number. He seems so in command of his musical abilities, it’s poignant to realize that in just two and a half months he’d be found dead in a London hotel room; the full set, on the album, is even more powerful.\nGillian G. Gaar, Special to The Seattle Times\nNoah Gunderson, ‘Carry the Ghost’ (Dualtone)\nNoah Gunderson’s sophomore full-length studio album “Carry the Ghost” might not represent a huge leap forward sonically, but if you listen closely, you can hear a young man in transition.\nWritten largely while he toured in support of his 2014 debut “Ledges,” there aren’t as many exuberant moments to be had on “Carry the Ghost.” Instead, Gundersen, 26, questions his career choice on the understated “Selfish Art,” singing, “sometimes I get the uneasy feeling that I’m doing something wrong.”\nLater, Gundersen — who grew up an evangelical Christian — wrestles with his religious background on “Empty from the Start.” There is no bitterness when he sings, “This is all we are, blood and bones, no Holy Ghost.” It is just a hard-won truth; one of many Gundersen has cataloged over two albums.\nWhen he’s not ruminating over more serious issues, Gundersen spends some time reflecting on love. Some of his best songs off “Ledges” were about relationships, and it’s no different this time around. On “Blossom,” Gundersen declares, “You hold my heart forever, but I can’t hold on to what’s not there.”\nIt’s the kind of cutting insight that you can only earn through experience. On “Carry the Ghost,” Gundersen is starting to show his.\nOwen R. Smith, Special to The Seattle Times\nThe Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, ‘Live in Cuba’ (Blue Engine)\nWynton Marsalis’ Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra has never released enough recordings, so it’s great news that the sparkling, sometimes scarily precise, 27-year-old big band will be releasing albums by way of a new label, J@LC’s Blue Engine Records. The label’s debut album — a two-disc set titled “Live in Cuba,” recorded at Havana’s Teatro Mella in 2010 — makes for a lively start.\nIts 16 selections are appropriately chosen with rhythm in mind, particularly those cross-hatched polyrhythms that wafted from Cuba to New Orleans in the early part of the 20th century, infusing jazz with what Jelly Roll Morton called “the Latin tinge.”\nConsequently, the rhythm section gets a real workout, especially bassist Carlos Enriquez, whose own debut album as a leader will be Blue Engine’s second release. The album kicks off with the fleet bassists’ bright and chipper “2/3’s Adventure,” which features a clapping pattern against a crisp sax riff and cha-cha interlude.\nThat’s just one highlight among many, which include baritone saxophonist Joe Temperley’s exquisite excursion on Duke Ellington’s “Sunset and the Mockingbird”; an inventive arrangement, with flutes, by trombonist Vince Gardner of Thelonious Monk’s quirky “Light Blue”; and a showstopping edition of Ellington’s “Braggin’ in Brass,” a piece so fast it’s unlikely many other bands can even play it, much less with the crisp precision of the J@LC outfit.\nOther memorable moments include Marsalis’ vigorous, shapely solo on his tune for small group, ‘Doin’ (Y) our Thing”; trombonist Chris Crenshaw’s evocation of painter Romare Bearden’s colorful urban series, The Block,” which dials down to a lovey, chuffing romantic tenor sax solo by Victor Goines; and the shout chorus closer (literally, the band shouts), Marsalis’ “Sanctified Blues,” from his work “Congo Square.”\nOn Dizzy Gillespie’s sizzling “Things to Come,” soulful tenor-sax man Walter Blanding Quote: s from Duke’s “It Don’t Mean A Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” a guiding principle of this classic-jazz band, which, not surprisingly, was greeted by thunderous Habanero cheers throughout the show.\nPaul de Barros, Seattle Times jazz critic\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:28:43.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
