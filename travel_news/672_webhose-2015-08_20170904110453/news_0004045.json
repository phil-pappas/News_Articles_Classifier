Hosted by Chengdu Tourism Administration and themed \"the Land of Abundance, the Journey of Fantasy\", the display was co-presented by Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture to highlight Chengdu as a travel and tourism destination. \nOn August 7, the 21 \"Land of Abundance, Journey of Fantasy\" tourist sites recommended by the Chengdu Tourism Administration will be put online at Ctrip.com, meaning tourists from all around the world can book trips to the 21 traveling route places by simply logging on to the Ctrip website and booking their dream holiday in the land of abundance. \nThe Journey of Fantasy traveling routes based around Chengdu cover the World Nature and Cultural Heritage sites, the Sichuan Opera, giant panda sanctuary and the spicy foods so synonymous with the city. By taking advantage of the 72-hour visa free transit, the Journey of Fantasy also offers two well planned travel routes that reveal the myth of World Nature and Cultural Heritage sites in Aba and Leshan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:26.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
