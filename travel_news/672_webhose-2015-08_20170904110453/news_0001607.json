Ms DiMascio said this particular EEAA Young Stars & Leaders Table will be especially beneficial for the industry’s Young Stars – they can learn from a leader with a stellar career at the helm of the most high profile events in the country and also from an inspiring young woman mentored by John. “This will be a very special night – John has embedded mentoring in his whole approach to work and community and he will co-present with Melissa, a young woman who has shone in her life-goals despite her disability. John Trevillian is the former Executive Director of Protocol and Special Events for the NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet and the Chief Executive Officer of the Australia Day Council of NSW. He has been involved in major government and community event planning, coordination and delivery for over 25 years including leadership roles in the Australia Day celebrations, Australian Bicentenary celebrations, the Sydney Olympic Games and NSW major annual events including New Year’s Eve and Mardi Gras. “John’s leadership has been recognised by the awarding of the Order of the Golden Rings from the International Olympic Committee, the Centenary Medal and the Order of Australia for his work in the community and the events industry,” Ms DiMascio said. “In November last year John was also presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award in the Australian Event Awards. “Melissa is an ambassador for the government campaign Don't DIS my ABILITY which celebrates the diversity and ability of people with disability,” she said. “Melissa has faced the challenges that are associated with having a disability head-on and has always been determined to achieve her goals. It will be a privilege to hear her speak.” Melissa is a founding member of the Special Olympics Dance Performance Group and performs at numerous corporate and charity events. She was also a bronze medal winner as a member of the Australian Special Olympics Softball team at the 2011 Special Olympics World Games in Athens.
