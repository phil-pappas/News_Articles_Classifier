The shops on the boardwalk are crowded. Downtown has become a year-round restaurant mecca. The Stone Pony, the music venue that Mr. Springsteen helped make famous, is host to ever larger rock concerts, and the New Zealander singer Lorde recorded “Yellow Flicker Beat” for a movie in the “Hunger Games” series at one of the city’s three recording studios. “It’s finally turning a corner,” said Jennifer Lampert, who first visited here 12 years ago and moved last year from Manhattan to open the Festhalle & Biergarten, a beer garden in a downtown industrial building. “It’s got all the elements you could find in a big city, but it’s a small town by the sea. It’s a liberal, open-minded, come-as-you-are kind of town.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story There still are not many retail shops downtown, but a developer, iStar Residential, the third master developer in three decades, has four projects lined up for empty lots in the beachfront redevelopment area. In what iStar is calling a pivotal moment, the company will soon seek public approval for its plans to build a 16-story luxury hotel and condominium on an Ocean Avenue foundation where two previous developers failed. “We believe in Asbury Park’s potential,” iStar’s chairman, Jay Sugarman, said. “I want it to be a cool, creative community where there’s always something going on, where there are always interesting people to run into. To be able to do that in a beachfront environment is the best of both worlds.” Asbury Park’s revival has more to do with demographic trends and a generational desire to live in more urban areas than a master plan hatched in the 1980s that largely failed to take off. Gay men and lesbians have gravitated to Asbury as a less expensive alternative to Fire Island and the Hamptons. Rail service also makes it easily accessible from New York City and northern New Jersey, and the city has a solid core of downtown commercial buildings ripe for development. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “All these factors came together,” said James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. “Great buildings downtown. The gay community was in there very early because they didn’t care about the school system. Now you have millennials suffering fatigue from being raised in the suburbs. The shore still has magic.” Photo The recently built townhouses at Vive sold out in two days.

Asbury Park had been a booming seaside resort since the late 1800s, with about 200 hotels and a carnival-like atmosphere on the boardwalk, stretching from the Casino building at the south end to the Paramount Theater and the convention hall at the north. The city’s fortunes began a slow decline in the late 1960s, a downturn that was exacerbated by a riot fueled by racial tensions in 1970 from which the city never fully recovered. “When I came down here from New York 11 or 12 years ago,” Carter Sackman, a developer, said, “close to 90 percent of the central business district was boarded up. No cars. Tumbleweeds.” Mr. Sackman, who now owns many downtown buildings, converted the dormant Steinbach department store into apartments. Today, his daughter, Morgan Sackman, 26, is renovating an old downtown vaudeville theater, the Savoy, into a performance space, with 64 micro-apartments on the floors above for musicians and artists. Steve and Shanti Mignona found a home in Asbury. They were living in Brooklyn and working in the restaurant industry when they started looking for a more affordable location to open their own place. They considered Beacon, N.Y., in the Hudson River Valley, but last year settled on Asbury because there was a larger community of artists and young entrepreneurs.

The percentage of people living below the poverty line, 34.2 percent, is down only slightly from a decade ago, as is the crime rate. And the main route through the city’s largely African-American neighborhood in southwest Asbury Park looks tired and spare. Still, 22 shops have opened downtown since 2008 and boardwalk businesses generated $30 million in sales in 2014. Waterfront parking fees soared to $1.7 million last year, from zero in 2008. Ms. Clayton, who was elected to the City Council last year, said it was focused on extending the city’s revival to southwest Asbury, where she grew up and where she now lives in her parents’ home. The city does not have a large commercial base to generate jobs, but she expects that developers will hire locally for new hotels and townhouse developments. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T01:22:16.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
