Comment @LinnCoDustin Posted Aug. 11, 2015 at 8:30 AM A recent effort by the Missouri Humanities Council (MHC) caught the eye of several local tourism gurus, who have decided to band together to help each other out. The effort refers to heritage tourism, which will create a new, unified tourism theme for the existing attractions in Linn County, and will take advantage of new natural tourism efforts. The goal as stated in a release by the MHC is “to spur local economic development, discover and exhibit Missouri's rich and abundant cultural heritage resources, and integrate existing tourism-related resources throughout the state with proposed heritage tourism projects.” This release spurred a group consisting of: the Brookfield Area Growth Partnership, the General John J. Pershing Museum and Leadership Archives, Walt Disney Hometown Museum, Brookfield Main Connection, Linneus Historical Society, Tillman House Museum, and Downtown Marceline; into action. The BAGP wrote a proposal to the members of these organizations, and to the Highway 36 Heritage Alliance, seeking grant funds to obtain the services of the University of Missouri Extension, to formulate both the heritage and unified tourism themes in Linn County. In the proposal, the group listed some purposes and goals. They are as follows: Purpose: By utilizing the strategic doing process, the group proposes to connect the efforts and resources of the many county tourism based organizations, businesses, museums and events to create a more effective and complete tourism network. Which will, in turn, strengthen the economy in Linn County. Goals: - Form the Linn County Tourism Network - Build bridges to existing attractions – each adding value to the other - Identify and market new attractions and supportive businesses - Establish collective countywide marketing efforts “A Linn County Tourism Network has long been a dream for many of us,” said Becky Cleveland of the Brookfield Area Growth Partnership. “In partnership with the Highway 36 Alliance and the University of Missouri Extension, we are convinced that the timing is right to make that happen.” The economic value of tourism is one that has come to light in recent years, and possibly no where more so than with the Walt Disney Hometown Museum in Marceline. Director Kaye Malins noted the value of the tours that stop by her facility. “Tours come in and spend money in our communities,” said Malins. “This helps us all with the tax base. The fact that you can't get anywhere on Highway 36 without coming here first is a big plus for our area.” Malins notes that our two major draws of Walt Disney and General John J. Pershing are well known and do bring the tourists in. But she also noted the connection between Linn County's two most famous residents. Page 2 of 3 - “They knew each other from the war,” said Malins. “Walt acted as a driver for General Pershing and his son in France. They remained friends after the war was over.” With this spirit of camaraderie already in place between the most famous sons of Linn County, the joining of the many tourism interests in the area seems a no-brainer. The grant was received, and approved. Now, the University of Missouri Extension is coming to the area to help strategically plan the next steps. “Contemporary economics confirms that rural communities, wanting to remain sustainable, must create places where people want to live, visit, and invest,” said Tracy Marlo Daugherity of the Extension. “Communities that overlook tourism as being vital to economic investment fall victim to a decades-old theory that rural economies should exclusively target manufacturing jobs in response to population loss and manufacturing decline. In reality communities are more effective in developing manufacturing jobs and jump-starting business start-ups when a comprehensive approach to building community appeal is used; tourism development and marketing of a community’s heritage, including history and cultural experience, hit multiple targets for broadening community appeal.” Daugherity also touched on how tourism is an industrial business in Missouri, and showcased the numbers from the Department of Revenue. “Tourism as an industrial sector is thriving in Missouri’s economy,” said Daugherity. “Reports from the Missouri Department of Revenue suggest that the tourism sector is going to continue to boom. According to the Missouri Division of Tourism, 43 million visitors are expected in Fiscal Year 2018 compared to Fiscal Year 2014’s 39.2 million tourists. In Fiscal Year 2014 the Missouri Division of Tourism tracked Linn County’s visitor-based revenue at $9.6 million while sustaining 288 jobs. That is an increase of $676,593 from the previous year.” With four museums in Linn County already (Tillman House, Disney Hometown, Pershing Archives and Linneus Jail), the trick will be to weave all of their stories into one cohesive narrative. Malins sees that this shouldn't be too much of a problem, and looks to tie another local industry into the tourism theme. “Tillman House Museum already tells the story of the whole county,” said Malins. “Hunting is huge here. It needs to be embraced as a source of tourism. Hunters bring a lot of revenue into Linn County.” Malins continues: “Being able to tie all of our numbers together, advertise together, and work as a unit, will be a huge benefit to us all.” Cleveland noted the commitments from the various organizations in her letter, and many of these groups also submitted letters to help obtain the grant that is funding the Extension's efforts. Many of these supporters also attended a Heritage Tourism Workshop in Macon, further solidifying the need to help one another in these efforts. Page 3 of 3 - “University of Missouri Extension is pleased to work cooperatively with the Highway 36 Heritage Alliance and the Missouri Humanities Council to bring tourism planning support to Linn County,” said Daugherity. “Community organizations in Linn County presented a cohesive message in their application for selection as a pilot study area. That message is that Linn County is progressive in its commitment to using tourism as a means to grow its economy.” Daugherity continued: “It was clear to the selection team that Linn County is progressive in its approaches to building county-wide attractiveness. The level of commitment to jointly market and develop community resources certainly impressed reviewers. Letters of support from the Walt Disney Hometown Museum, Brookfield Area Growth Partnership, the Linneus County Historical Museum, Brookfield Downtown Main Connection, and Pershing Park Memorial Association pledged joint commitment to attract visitors, bring home former residents, and grow local businesses.” Anyone interested in helping with these efforts is welcome to a meeting at the Brookfield Area Growth Partnership offices on Main Street in Brookfield from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. on September 28. The focus of this meeting is on the strategic doing process, and planning action steps for the area to take.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:07:27.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
