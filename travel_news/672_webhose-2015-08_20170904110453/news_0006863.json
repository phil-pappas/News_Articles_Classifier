(NASDAQ: LSTR), a worldwide, asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions delivering safe, specialized transportation logistics services, is proud to announce that Landstar has been recognized as one of the industry's leading transportation logistics providers in Logistics Management's 2015 Quest for Quality Awards Survey.\nLandstar received 2015 Quest for Quality Awards in the following two categories: Dry Freight Carriers and Intermodal Marketing Companies .\nEach year since 1983, Logistics Management has surveyed a representative sample of its readers to evaluate the transportation logistics service providers that they use. More than 4,649 logistics and supply chain decision makers cast their votes for the carriers and 3PLs providing outstanding customer satisfaction and performance excellence over the past year.\nThe six-month long research and survey process ranks transportation service providers on five key criteria: On-time Performance, Value, Information Technology, Customer Service, and Equipment & Operations. A different set of criteria is used to judge companies in the third-party categories. Third-party logistics providers are rated on the following attributes: Carrier Selection & Negotiation, Customer Service/Value Add (Warehousing & Distribution), Order Fulfillment, Transportation & Distribution, Inventory Management, and Logistics Information Systems.\n\"What makes the Quest for Quality Awards stand out in the market is the fact that the winners are determined by the readers of Logistics Management -the buyers of logistics and transportation services who put these carriers and service providers to work around the clock and around globe,\" said Michael Levans , Group Editorial Director of Peerless Media, LLC., the publisher of Logistics Management.\n\"The growth of e-commerce and the subsequent evolution of omni-channel fulfillment has changed the game for both retailers and manufacturers, shortening lead times across the board,\" said Levans. \"According to the readers of Logistics Management , the list of carriers and service providers receiving a Quest for Quality Award this year have been equal to the task, matching their ever-demanding service needs and helping them keep pace with the new speed of global business.\"\n\"We are honored by this confirmation of our customers' confidence in Landstar's ability to provide excellence in transportation logistics solutions,\" said Jim Gattoni , Landstar President and CEO. \"We'd like to thank our customers and Logistics Management readers for this recognition as a quality carrier and intermodal services provider.
