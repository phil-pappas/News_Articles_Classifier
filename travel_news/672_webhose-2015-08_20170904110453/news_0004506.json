At least not in the near term. In the repurchase, announced Thursday, Alaska will buy back 10 percent of the company’s outstanding stock. This will be the largest stock buyback in company history. In a release, Alaska Air Group CEO Brad Tilden said the decision was essentially about giving back to shareholders at a time of record cash flows. “We are reinvesting in the business and returning cash to our owners, and we intend to continue doing more of the same in the future,” he said in a release. “We are confident in the future of Alaska Air Group and committed to building long-term shareholder value.” Analyst Joe DeNardi , of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company in Baltimore, thinks Tilden’s statement reflects the company’s current motivation. “They have a very good management team committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, and I think that’s what they’re doing,” he said. But he added that Alaska could eventually face a takeover attempt, especially if there’s a market downturn. “I don't think that's how they’re looking at (the stock buy back),” he said. “I do see them as a target, but not in the next 24 months.” So would the stock buybacks shield Alaska in the future if a takeover attempt were made? “It should make the stock more expensive, theoretically,” DeNardi said. In a 2007 interview with Puget Sound Business Journal, then Alaska Air Group CEO Bill Ayer addressed the same point: “We are adamant to remain independent; that’s the best for our industry and our customers,” Ayer said. “What we believe is the best defense against this stuff is strong financial profits. Good profits and a high stock price will defend us against a takeover that we don’t want.” Delta Air Lines has been considered a possible acquirer for years. But DeNardi thought that was unlikely, on the grounds that the Department of Justice probably wouldn’t allow the resultant domination of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport by one carrier. Instead he thinks contenders would be American Airlines, which has become a strong partner for Alaska , or Southwest Airlines, which runs a somewhat-similar fleet of Boeing 737s. To be sure, rumors about imminent takeovers of Alaska have been swirling for decades , and management has consistently said the airline is intent on staying independent. The stock repurchase will be Alaska’s ninth since 2007. The company has spent over $1.1 billion buying back more than 53 million shares of its stock, or about one third of the total shares outstanding at that time. \nWant Seattle Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T01:01:05.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
