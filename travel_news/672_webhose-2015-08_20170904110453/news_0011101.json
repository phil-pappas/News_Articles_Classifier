This is a period of celebration. Local Phuketians believe it is necessary to avoid eating meats, but instead consume vegetarian menus only. There are many ceremonies during the nine-day and nine-night festival, such as fire-walking and blade-walking, in which the performers walk across a stepladder made of sharp iron blades. There is also a religious procession to the main shrine, Jui Tui. Many participants will be joining the parade along the main road of Phuket, as they act as mediums and gods, puncturing themselves on the cheeks, believing that such acts could rid of future harm. \nAmari Phuket takes part of this special event by offering a special “Hot Deal” package (promotion code: PKTVGF2015) . For a minimum of three-night stay at any room categories, guests will receive a 10% discount on the room rate, buffet breakfast and one-way transfer from Amari Phuket to Jui Tui Shrine to be a part of the festival for one time, per stay.
