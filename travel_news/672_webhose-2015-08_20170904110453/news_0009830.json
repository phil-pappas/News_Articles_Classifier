The con pair along with loot worth almost 80,000 euros were arrested in central France.\nThe pair carriend out thefts at various luxury hotels in Nice and Monaco, Lyon, in Evian in the Alps and in the stylish suburbs of Paris. They would use the stethoscope to listen at the door to ensure nobody was inside and the chisel and hammer to remove the safe from the wall before putting it in a suitcase and leaving.\nThe couple, aged 56 and 31, would search for room numbers of Gulf tourists, go to reception posing as them and say that their keys are lost.\nThe couple was apparently identified owing to a video surveillance of a previous robbery. The loot consisted of jewellery, expensive clothing and foreign currency, mostly from Gulf countries. Police also found 20 hotel room key cards and tools that helped them function smoothly.\nRecently the UAE issued a warning to all its citizens travelling abroad to avoid flaunting expensive clothing or accessories to ensure their safety in a foreign country. The ministry urged citizens to follow travel guidelines and procedures of the countries that they visit.\nThe warning follows an incident in the UK last year where three Emirati sisters were attacked and robbed in a luxury London hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:03:50.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
