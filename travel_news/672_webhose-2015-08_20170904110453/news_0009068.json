UK visitors to Japan numbered 26,300 in July 2015, 34% more than in the same month last year.\nAn estimated 30,000 scouts from over 150 countries attended the World Scout Jamboree, a 12-day event that ended on 8 August in Kirarahama in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Around 4,000 scouts attended from Britain. The jamboree included a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum for participants to learn from the events of 1945, as part of the 70th anniversary of a nuclear bomb being dropped on the city. Other activities included water sports, volunteering in local Japanese communities and home stays with Japanese families. The event hashtag, #WSJ2015, has generated 21,117 Instagram posts of scouts having fun in Japan.\nThe British pound now stands at a strong 195 yen to the Japanese yen, making Japan great value for British travellers. On the ground in Tokyo this equates to paying from £0.70 for a journey on the city’s Mero system, from £0.55 for two pieces of sushi at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and from £2.60 for a pint of beer.\nFlights prices from the UK to Japan have also dropped this year, with the current best offer £499 return with KLM. See the Latest Deals section of Japan National Tourism Organization’s website, for more Japan flight and holiday offers.\n“InsideJapan Tours is not surprised about the big increase of people travelling to Japan from the UK as the numbers are reflected in our own numbers of customers travelling this summer. The strength of the pound against the yen and the great value offered by Japan and what InsideJapan Tours can provide for their customers, is perhaps one of the reasons why numbers are up. InsideJapan Tours are also sending more and more families who are restricted to travelling during the summer and school holidays which could also add to the statistics. Although the summer does not have the blossom of spring or the red leaves of autumn peak seasons, there are plenty of festivals during the summer and it is the only time people can climb illustrious Mt Fuji – more possible reasons as to why summer numbers to Japan are on the increase,” said James Mundy of InsideJapan Tours.\nJapan is on course to receive a record number of visitors in 2016, with over 11 million people already having travelled to Japan from January to July, 47% up on the same period in 2015.\nSource:- See Japan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:16:34.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
