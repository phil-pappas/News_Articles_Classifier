A B777-300ER will be making this historic flight which, at more than 16 hours, should be one of the longest flights in commercial aviation today. The Saudi flag carrier launched its Los Angeles to Jeddah nonstop service last year, on March 31, 2014, starting with 3 flights a week and currently at 5 flights weekly during the summer peak season. \nWhile the nonstop LAX-RUH flights will only be limited to the month of August due to the airline’s peak period, the service is expected to be restored in the future to fulfil the needs of Saudi students, the diplomatic community as well as business travellers who prefer to fly nonstop to the Saudi capital. Aside from Los Angeles International, Saudia currently flies daily from New York JFK, daily from Washington Dulles International and 3 times a week from Toronto Pearson International Airport. All flights are nonstop either to Jeddah or Riyadh, with convenient connections to all Saudi domestic points and beyond Saudi Arabia to its international gateways in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe. Saudia currently flies to more than 80 destinations. As a member of SkyTeam global airline alliance, Saudia also has access to more than 1,000 worldwide destinations serviced by the alliance’s 20 members. All flights are operated with Boeing B777-300ER with 2 and 3-class configurations. The LAX flights have 24 seats in First Class, 36 seats in Business Class and 245 seats in its Guest Class. Saudia has recently announced the acquisition of 50 new Airbus 330 and 320 aircraft. Eight Boeing B787-900 Dreamliners are also on order with the first aircraft expected to be delivered at the end of the year.
