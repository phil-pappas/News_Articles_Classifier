Walks have become a nightmare as she stops to eat soil all the time. Our vet cannot explain this. Can you? PT, London There is no single proven cause of soil eating (“geophagia”). There may be medical reasons (anaemia, underactive thyroid gland or an irritated digestive tract, perhaps due to a food allergy), or it could just be a random habit. Ask your vet about a routine blood profile, a trial treatment with gastric protectants, and a food trial with a hypoallergenic diet. If unsuccessful, the next stage is a referral to a behavioural specialist. We are terrapin keepers (we have three, each as big as a side plate). Someone recently gave us a tiny turtle measuring 2cm in diameter. It turns out that he is a common snapping turtle. How big will he get and how long will he live? RK, Swindon If you care for him properly, he will grow to a huge size and live for up to a hundred years. I treated a 10-year-old recently that weighed 23kg (the size of a small Labrador). When they reach this size, they are physically dangerous, with a long, muscular neck that whips around like a striking rattlesnake. Their jaws are so strong that they can cause serious injuries to humans and to other pets. You need to reflect carefully before committing yourself to long-term care of this fascinating but challenging creature. Ted, my two-year-old ginger, is neutered but still behaves like a tomcat. He sprays around the house and garden, stays out all night, fights and I am pretty sure he is chasing girls as well. Wasn’t neutering supposed to calm him down? CW, Belfast Neutering stops testosterone production, which reduces male behaviours, such as you describe, by 80 per cent. You are witnessing the remaining 20 per cent. Without castration, Ted would be far worse. You can reduce the remaining problem behaviour by modifying his environment so that he feels less threatened by other cats in the area: high ledges and low-down hidey-holes around the home will help. How is pet food made? An online animated film provides a useful update on the truth about how pet food is made for cats and dogs, covering the legislation involved, the ingredients used and how these are processed.
