DIA, VISIT DENVER and race organizers have joined together once again to bring airport visitors a bicycle-themed art exhibition. A group of local artists, curated by Ivar Zeile of the Plus Gallery, created bike-themed artwork that are displayed on top of baggage carousels, located on the east and west sides of Jeppesen Terminal (Level 5).\nArtists featured in the exhibit include Erin Asmussen, Libby Barbee, Phil Bender, John Ferguson, Claudia Mastrobuono, Collin Parson, Dylan Gebbia Richards, Sarah Rockett, Mario Zoots and Brian Klees. At the end of the exhibit, the artwork will be donated to cycling-related nonprofit organizations.\nSource:- Denver International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T07:46:01.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
