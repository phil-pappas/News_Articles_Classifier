A dog is for life, so the saying goes, and not just for Christmas. Well, that may not be entirely true anymore. Because as society gradually embraces the more enlightened aspects of a so-called “sharing economy” - which maximises the benefits of temporary possession - so the canine world is opening itself up to those who want a little four-legged companionship but without the hassle of ownership. Increasingly popular digital forums are connecting dog owners with those who aren’t entirely committed to the rigours and responsibilities of full-time ownership. Families who are thinking of investing in a pet and want a brief trial, for example, or those who yearn to supplement their weekends with a little weekend animal magic, or even other canine owners who want to help out those who live nearby. Companies like Borrow My Doggy are convinced that they are not just providing a useful service for people but ensuring that animals get the very best love and attention. “People come to us who have been thinking of buying a dog but want to be certain that, emotionally and physically, they’ll be able to cope full-time,” says Lynn Unick who helps to run Borrow My Doggy, which matches dog owners with local borrowers across Britain who might be going on holiday or need some dog-sitting help. “Or else maybe they have strenuous jobs during the week and can’t look after a pet properly but want to spend their weekends doing so. In which case we put them in touch with dog owners who live close to them and might be going away for the weekend and, instead of using kennels, want to place their pet in a more domestic setting.” Increasing numbers of medical studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of pet ownership Of course it’s a more rigorous set-up than that – and that’s one of the essential aspects of the business. Applicants for borrowing need to submit detailed profiles and are then chosen for “adoption” by dog owners through the website. The owners themselves – and Borrow My Doggy has all manner of breeds on its books, from golden retrievers to labradoodles - have to provide detailed information about their dogs so there are no unfortunate surprises. Setting up a profile is free, but membership costs £44.99 a year for owners and less than £10 for borrowers. Then, before any exchange is agreed, both parties meet at a mutual venue, principally so the all-important pooch can get the opportunity to sniff out their new suitor. Let’s face it, you don’t want to agree to a blind date unless you’ve got some idea who you’re going to be spending it with. As Unick says: “These animals are their owners’ pride and joy, and we have to make absolutely sure that everyone clicks. You can’t just call up and say, ‘Can I have a dog next weekend?’ You need to show you can take on the responsibility. It’s more than just connecting people – all of us are in some way custodians of these dogs; we need to do the right thing for them.” Increasing numbers of medical studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of pet ownership – and, of course, there are physical benefits too, especially for those who lead more sedentary lifestyles. However, with more of us working longer hours, living in smaller, urban homes and perhaps wary of the financial and emotional burdens of ownership, dog borrowing might be the smartest solution for those who love their animals but quite can’t commit. As for the dogs themselves… well, who doesn’t love an occasional all-inclusive weekend away with endless treats, doting staff at your beck and call, and the promise of being smothered in love the moment you’re reunited back home?
