Incorporating maps as décor is a great way to display your personality, show where you've traveled, and indicate where you'd like to journey next.\nLet Rand McNally show you how to wake up your walls with a new variety of wall maps and map art available for home and office:\nWhen decorating a child's room or classroom, chose the Signature World and U.S. maps with their bold and vivid colors. Featuring a classic blue ocean, these maps make a vibrant statement as well as useful reference pieces. Hang the sophisticated parchment-style Classic Edition World and U.S. wall map to show a love of travel. Designed for a living room as well as a board room, these maps add a touch of class. The Premium World map features saturated colors printed on a silky smooth polyethylene paper that gives the piece a lustrous sheen. This map fits best on the walls of a modern office or home. Artist Wendy Gold's unique ImagineNations™ creations add flair and a whimsical element to a room. The lithographs inspire conversation, including a world map with butterflies, a world map featuring a peace on Earth motif, and a \"Jardin Monde\" map showing the world as an overflowing cornucopia. Once you have your art, it's all about presentation. It's important to hang artwork at the right height. Keep in mind the average human eye level is about 57 inches from the floor. Of course, creating the unexpected can be a great way to decorate, such as hanging art low below the window so those seated can enjoy the piece at eye level.\nAnd remember, globes also add a flourish to a desk or shelf. A 12-inch Atlas desk globe , with the bronzed titan holding the world on his shoulders, fits in a variety of spaces.\nPeruse store.randmcnally.com for more decorating ideas.\n*Source: U.S. Census Bureau\nAbout Rand McNally – Rand McNally is the country's most trusted source for maps, navigation, and travel content.
