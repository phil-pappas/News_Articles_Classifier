The home features many terraces and loggias and lots of floor-to-ceiling windows. Finishes include Persian onyx, marble and French limestone, and there are stained glass skylights throughout. \"Itâ€™s designed for an 8.3 on the Richter scale earthquake,\" said Victor Nikravesh, an advisor to the builder.Like most high-end homes these days, Casa Lago also features smart home technology, a wine room, billiards room, and a theater that seats 14 people. There are both an outdoor infinity pool and a separate indoor pool. Both have hot tubs and steam rooms. The home also features a gym and a fire pit.The property lies about a 12-minute drive from Rodeo Drive. It is a speculative house (built without a committed buyer) by Marmara Development Group, founded by Hassam Aghnami. This is Aghnami's first luxury speculative home but he has been in the construction industry for more than 25 years. He is currently working on four other luxury homes.Rey said the home would likely appeal to foreign buyer, particularly those from the Middle East or Asia who prefer new construction to previously-owned almost exclusively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:05:09.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
