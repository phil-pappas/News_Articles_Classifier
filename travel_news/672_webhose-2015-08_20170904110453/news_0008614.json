The retreats specifically cater to practitioners of all ages and skill levels, offering a balanced mix of yoga and relaxation techniques including hatha, vinyasa and ying yoga, as well as Talise Spa’s signature sunset yoga evenings on the resort’s 2 km stretch of private beach.\nAlongside regular yoga sessions led by experienced and qualified instructors, the three-day programme features exclusive wellness and nutrition experiences, including a detox juicing class from Talise Wellness Executive Chef Gabi Kurz and a detox lecture by renowned naturopath Angelika Hartung. Special infrared sauna sessions will also be available.\nVijay Sharma, Talise Spa Yoga Wellbeing Consultant, said: “At Talise Spa, Madinat Jumeirah, we are continually evolving our offering to meet the growing demand for holistic experiences. Our popular outdoor morning and sunset yoga sessions on the beach and our detox yoga retreats welcome increasing numbers each year. We spend so much time indoors exposed to air conditioning, we are often removed from nature. When you practice yoga outdoors, lunar and solar energy effects relaxation on mental, physical, and spiritual levels. These revitalising outdoor sessions are the foundation of our retreats and are integrated with studio yoga, pampering spa treatments and a detox programme to enable a complete sense of rejuvenation.”\nThe schedule combines various elements of the ancient practice of yoga into a rejuvenating three-day break, the retreat aims to provide everyone – from beginners or intermediate to advanced practitioners – an opportunity to harmonise their mind, body and soul in a tranquil and uplifting setting, elevated by a feeling of community.\nSource:- Jumeirah", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:14:08.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
