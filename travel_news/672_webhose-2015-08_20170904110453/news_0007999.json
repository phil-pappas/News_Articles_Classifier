DeWit contends Ducey’s plan would require Congress to sign off on changes to the 1910 Enabling Act, which allowed Arizona to become a state. (Ducey disagrees.)\nWhen congressional members walked off the elevator after meeting with Ducey, DeWit was there to greet them.\n“I figured as long as they’re here, I might as well say hi – it’s not that frequent that they’re all down here like that,” DeWit said. “I thought I might as well send them home with (literature) about my take. You know how busy they are, if I just mail it to their office, I can’t ensure I’ll actually get it into their hands.”\nDeWit said the conversations were light-hearted. “I just said, ‘By the way there’s some signs over there that share one side of the issue, here’s something you can read if you want to get put to sleep that shows the other side of the issue.' ”\nEarlier this month, Ducey’s office set up nine giant posters touting the ed-funding plan in the Executive Tower lobby. The fact the display was just outside DeWit’s office had nothing to do with it, Ducey’s staff said; they were simply taking advantage of the highly trafficked lobby.\nYvonne Wingett Sanchez Reporter: Yvonne Wingett Sanchez covers the Governor’s Office and state politics with an emphasis on accountability of state officials.
