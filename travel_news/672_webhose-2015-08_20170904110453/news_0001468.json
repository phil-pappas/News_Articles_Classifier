The Radisson Blu Residence Istanbul Batisehir will be located on the western side of Istanbul as part of the Batisehir project, one of the largest and most marketed real estate developments in town. On a surface of 818,000sqm, Batisehir will offer a mix of residential buildings, offices, retail space and an educational centre. Upon completion, the complex will host 15,000 people. Conveniently located between the Atatürk International Airport and the city centre and highly visible, the Radisson Blu Residence will comprise 171 studios and apartments (23-125sqm) with Radisson Blu signature elements such as free high speed internet access.
