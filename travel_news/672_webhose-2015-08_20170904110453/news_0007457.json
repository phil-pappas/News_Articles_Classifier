You are Here > Home > Europe Map > Italy Map > Tuscany Map \nTuscany, Italy's largest region, contains a population just short of 4 million. It's the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. Art is everywhere; the landscapes are gorgeous (and diverse!) and the food and wine is superb. \nTourists flock to Tuscany's capital, Florence , and many of them also make it out to a few of Tuscany's six World Heritage sites , crowding into the historic center of San Gimignano on warm summer days or heading over to Pisa to take a gander at that leaning tower. A few manage to reserve tickets for the Palio di Siena . It takes a more seasoned traveler to find the two others: Pienza and the Val d'Orchia . \nTuscany is full of Treasures, from the marble quarries of Massa and Carrara to the wines regions of Chianti , Montepulciano and Montalcino to the Etruscan centers around Cortona and Pitigliano . Explore the region with our map. Tuscany Map Map of Tuscany Â© James Martin, licensed to About Tuscany Travel Articles and Maps \nTuscany Transportation Map from Italy Travel. While many travelers think that a car is an absolute necessity, it's surprising how many of Tuscany's smaller places can be accessed by trains, which tend to be quite inexpensive in Italy. An Italian rail pass is not necessary if you're only visiting Tuscany and environs, just buy your tickets at the station and get going. \nBoring Tuscany - Beefsteak, Rolling Hills, and Clods of Clay - A look at the suggestive and erotic landscape of Tuscany that attracts us, with suggestions for the traveler hungry to experience the Tuscan traditions formed out of this provocative landscape. \nThe landscape can best be seen from the wicker basket of a hot air balloon, of course. For what a ride is like and how you can reserve one, see: Ballooning Tuscany . \nLunigiana Map and Tourist Resources - Visit the cities of the far northern region of Tuscany in this undiscovered bit of Tuscany. The Lunigiana and Garfagnana are Tuscany's rough and ready rural heart where independent folks have been making their own food for ages, a different kind of foodie paradise in which molecular gastronomy has no place. Places to Stay: Hotels and Tuscan Spas \nSince the time of the Etruscans, Tuscany's hot springs have been known for their curative properties. The Tuscan spa town of Montecatini Terme (the Terme at the end of the name indicates the presence of thermal baths) is on the rail line that links Lucca and Florence and offers an enormous variety of spa treatments, including taking the waters at the historic and elegant Terme Tettuccio. \nTo really enjoy the Tuscan countryside, you might want to rent a vacation house. You can call it a villa if you like. HomeAway lists over 7000 user-rated properties in Tuscany (book direct). Plan your vacation to live like a Tuscan \nYes, if you rent that vacation house in the Tuscan countryside you'll be rewarded generously for your travel savvy. Despite the Renaissance charms of cities like Florence or its smaller and more compact sister Pistoia , the rural countryside is where the great food and wine comes from. You'll have to rent or lease a car, of course, but driving through the patchwork of vineyards, olive groves and orchards is a delight, especially if you have no where in particular to go. \nUnlike many places in America, you're just as likely to come across that perfect restaurant sitting alone amongst the olive trees and vineyards in the countryside as you would in a city like Pisa or Lucca . Wineries like Barone Ricasoli include restaurants with food designed to show off their wines. \nSundays are special in Italy--especially for locals who spend the time with their families when shops are closed. Join them in crowded restaurants animated with the chatter of people enjoying the food, wine and companionship of their family and friends.

Florence - Tuscany's Big Attraction \nFlorence , although dating from Roman times, recognized its finest moments as a star among European cities between the 14th and 16th centuries. Widely held to be the birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence was a nexus for trade in Europe; the wealth those in power drew from this trade is legendary. The rich and powerful few surrounded themselves with writers, artists and scholars who left behind works still marveled at today. \nMeaning, of course, that the tourist who wants to see everything will have to stay quite a long time. A week is really too little for the art lover who can tolerate a city foll of tourists. \nAlso meaning that museums will be full in the season. One thing you can do to alleviate long lines and the fear that you'll not get into your favorites is to buy tickets from a service like Select Italy in advance. It will cost you more, make no mistake, but how much would you pay to assure yourself a visit without, in many cases, standing in line for an indeterminate amount of time? See a list of museum and tickets available from Select Italy (book direct). \nFor those who don't have a week or more to spend in Florence, a list of the top 10 attractions should allow you to set your priorities to the most popular sites in the Tuscan tourist stronghold. And for the budget conscious, don't forget there are free things to do in the Renaissance city, too. \nFood is sometimes difficult in big tourist centers like Florence, so we've asked a local to recommend some typical places to eat and drink.

My favorite time is the beginning of November, when the weather is usually holding, and the clouds conspire to make every picture better than it would have in the clear light of summer. November is also truffle season. In all, I like fall, and Martha of Italy Travel likes spring--for the wildflowers. \nIf you'd like to see the historic climate charts for Florence, see Florence Weather and Climate .

Both are tourist attractions and deserve to be. Both offer fine food that comes from ideal growing conditions and both have fine local wine and unmatched natural beauty.

Getting between the two will take you about 7 hours, as it says in our Provence to Tuscany Itinerary .
