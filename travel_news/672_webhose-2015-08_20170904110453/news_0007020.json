Designed to attract more golfers to Thailand, the event underscored the Kingdom’s rapidly growing popularity as a world-class golfing destination. TAT invited 153 golfers from 27 overseas offices to the Thailand Golf Travel Mart, held between August 4- 6, 2015 at Dusit Thani Hua Hin Hotel.\nThailand has a lot going for it on the golf front: With over 200 world-class golf courses, many designed by internationally acclaimed architects, topped with competitive green fees against the backdrop of Thailand’s beautiful landscapes and complemented by myriad attractions, the destination makes for a great golf escape.\nSoraya Homchuen , director, Tourism Authority of Thailand – Mumbai office said, “The wonderful thing about a golf vacation in Thailand is that it can be combined with other aspects. Golfers may travel in a group of golfers and can even tag family members along because Thailand offers countless other activities to indulge in. Moreover, golfers will be more than happy with the standard of golf facilities and services. Thailand has more than 200 challenging and exciting golf courses and the weather is favourable almost year-round. Additionally, golfers from across the world appreciate our clubhouse facilities. Caddies are well-trained and are enthusiastic about to extending Thailand’s world famous hospitality to visitors. Green fees underscore Thailand’s value for money proposition.”\nTraditional golf markets for Thailand have been Japan, Korea and Europe. Today, India and China have also risen to be key markets with many HNIs and upwardly mobile individuals jet-setting for golf getaways to Thailand. The golf market will be among TAT’s key focus areas in the years to come as the tourism embarks on a strategy aimed at ensuring qualitative (measured by spend, length of stay and maturity of the tourist experience) growth versus quantitative (measured by arrivals) growth only.\nThailand has welcomed 426,876 Indians from January through May 2015, indicating that arrivals in half yearly arrivals crossed the half a million mark. In 2014, 946,269 Indians travelled to Thailand.\nMoreover, Thailand is gaining international recognition in the international golfing fraternity, attracting awards and international championships. Earlier this year, Hua Hin played host to the Centara World Masters Championship, which had previously spent 18 years drawing the world’s golfers to Australia’s turf. Hua Hin bagged 2014 Golf Destination of the year award for Asia and Australia by IAGTO (International Association of golf Tour Operators). The win was the second major golf award for Thailand: In 2012 Pattaya won this award.\n 13, 2015 5:28 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T00:53:14.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
