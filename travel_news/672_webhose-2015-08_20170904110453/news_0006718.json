Both Nespresso and Virgin Australia share similar values, in that we are both committed to innovation, sustainability, exceptional quality and excellence in customer service.\n“Working with B/E Aerospace and Virgin Australia, we have been able to bring together the expertise and technology required to serveNespresso’s range of high quality Grands Crus coffees on an aircraft,” he said.\nVirgin Australia and Nespresso have carefully chosen the on board coffee selection to complement the palate, as taste differs slightly in the air, and will offer three unique blends at launch including Ristretto Intenso, Espresso Forte and Espresso Decaffeinato.\nVirgin Australia’s resident head chef, Luke Mangan said: “Over the years we have been able to continue to delight our customers with unexpected food and beverage experiences on board. Together we have tackled how to best overcome the fact that we lose 30 per cent of our ability to taste in the sky and now, working with Nespresso will enable us to have an even more creative approach when it comes to developing coffee-inspired drinks and on board treats.”\nVirgin Australia is rolling out an exciting training program, together with Nespresso, for Business Class cabin crew, in which Nespressoeducates cabin crew on the use of the technology, the Nespresso Grands Crus available on board and overall coffee knowledge.\nNespresso and Virgin Australia will welcome the following coffee blends on board:\nRistretto Intenso – A daring blend of South and Central American Robustas and Arabica, Ristretto Intenso is a full coffee of exceptional intensity with notes of pepper and a creamy texture. Espresso Forte – Made exclusively from South and Central American Arabicas, the complex aroma of this intensely roasted espresso is a balance of strong and fruity notes. Espresso Decaffeinato – Dark-roasted South American, Arabicas with a touch of Robusta bring out the subtle cocoa and roasted cereal notes of this full-bodied decaffeinated espresso.\nVirgin Australia will feature the following coffee styles on board:\nCappuccino Espresso Macchiato Long Black Ristretto", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:59:32.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
