We are 10% up on last year so are confident that 2015 will be among our most successful.”\nJames Stephens from the Lost Gardens of Heligan agrees: “Visitcornwall.com has been one of our top website refers for many years. It’s thanks to great relationships such as this that we’ve just seen our busiest July in 12 years. The web referrals and summer visitors keep on coming and we’re on track for an amazing August!”\nThanks to a record-breaking July, Visit Cornwall is on track to smash its target of almost 4 million web visits for the year – a 20% increase on last year – and has plans to heighten the functionality and attractiveness of visitcornwall.com with a design refresh in the pipeline for the autumn.\n“Our website is Cornwall’s shop window to the world and offers visitors the facility to research everything in one place, whether that’s how to get here or what to do when you’re here,” said Malcolm Bell, Chief Executive of Visit Cornwall. “Our website traffic is a good indicator of the health of the industry so despite factors such as the Gove Effect still having a impact, I am cautiously optimistic for the success of the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:37:52.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
