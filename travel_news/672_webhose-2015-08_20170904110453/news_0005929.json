By Pam LeBlanc AUSTIN (TEXAS) AMERICAN-STATESMAN • Sunday August 16, 2015 5:00 AM \nThis place doesn’t look real. \nFrom the top of a steep hillside covered in lemon trees and grapevines, the village of Manarola tumbles out below, like a handful of pink, orange and yellow blocks that have been poured from a toy bag. \nManarola is one of five hamlets strewn a few miles apart along the Mediterranean coast in northern Italy. Each comes with its own personality, and the best way to see the lot is to pick one as a home base (we chose Manarola because it’s smaller and quieter than the others), then spend a few days hiking between them. \nWe left our cliffside apartment in the morning, hiked up through steep terraces covered with vineyards, paused to admire a chapel and sip lemonade in the pint-size village of Volastra, then descended into Corniglia, where we revived ourselves with gelato before striking out for the next town up the coast, Vernazza. \nIt’s easy to imagine the days when pirates sailed up and down this coast. The people who once lived here used stone watchtowers to defend their homes, which are perched on cliffs and tucked into nooks and crannies molded by Mother Nature. It’s long been a wine-producing region, and farmers planted crops on terraces they cut into the hills. \nBut things have changed in recent years. In 1951, about 3,500 acres of land here were cultivated. After the Cinque Terre was discovered by tourists in the 1970s, the economy began a gradual shift from agriculture to tourism. Today, only about 275 acres are cultivated. The crop abandonment has caused soil erosion and land degradation, and the trails here periodically wash out. \nWe had to adjust our hiking plans because of landslides. The flat, easy path between Manarola, the second village if you’re counting from the south, and the next village up the coast to the north, Corniglia, is covered with gravel. So is the easy, flat walkway known as Via dell’Amore, which connects Manarola with Riomaggiore, to the south. \nNo matter. We took the high road to Corniglia instead, hiking the spine of the hillside to get up and over, pausing for lemonade and to admire a chapel in an even tinier hamlet called Volastra. We were in no hurry. Here in the Cinque Terre, it’s all about walking, relaxing and soaking up the views. \nSome of the trails (especially the one from Vernazza to Monterosso) are extremely narrow and crowded. In sections, passage is only single file. \nAnd the steps! The Vernazza to Monterosso section of the trail has as many as a skyscraper; hike it north or your quads will stage a protest. \nVernazza and Monterosso offer fine swimming, too — so once you’ve worked up a sweat hiking, you can cool off in the sea. We braved the tiny gravel beach in Vernazza in our hiking duds — it was worth it. \nMonterosso’s beaches are more formal — you can rent a beach umbrella for 20 euros and swim in water protected by a rocky sandbar. Or hike a little farther — up and over the spit of land that essentially divides the town in two — for a more casual beach. \nEither way, spend some time exploring the market, the shops and the churches in this, the most bustling of the Cinque Terre’s five villages. \nThe good news? If you walk from one town to the next and don’t feel like hiking back, you can catch the train for a few euros. Even better, hop on a ferry for a different perspective of the Cinque Terre. \nIt’s an image you won’t soon forget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T16:39:31.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
