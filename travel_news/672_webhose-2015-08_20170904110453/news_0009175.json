Visit Baltimore launched the partnership , called Synchronicities, with the two sister cities a year ago. The program offers meeting planners deals for booking conventions in all three cities and leverages destination marketing opportunities for the three organizations. During the program's first year, each city landed seven conventions, accounting for more than 70,000 room nights and exceeding expectations. \"When we talked about this we were like, 'wouldn’t it be great if we saw three or four extra bookings out of this?'\" Visit Baltimore CEO Tom Noonan said. By the end of 2015, Baltimore will have hosted 30 citywide conventions during the year, and 28 are slated for 2016. Synchronicities has added more meetings to the mix, with citywide conventions booked as far out as 2025. The groups that booked through Synchronicities include the International Association of Exhibitions and Events (IAEE), the National Postal Forum, the Society of Toxicology, two meetings of the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials, Emerson Process Management and the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks). Three of those groups have never held their conventions in Baltimore, including IAEE, which will head to the Baltimore Convention Center in December. With destinations in the east, west and center of the United States, Noonan said booking through Synchronicities works best for associations because it allows them to cover their membership in different regions of the country. \"It’s an opportunity to leverage three like-minded destination with similar products,\" he said. \nGet Baltimore  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:52:38.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
