Bookings for the period had been escalating markedly since March 2015 when news of the extra public holiday was first announced. \n\nFor inbound travel to Singapore, Europe leads the way with a 9.9 per cent hike in total visitor nights compared with the same time last year. \n\nVisits from the Middle East, on the other hand, are lesser than 2014 because Ramadan was 10 days earlier this year than last. \n\nThe ForwardKeys analysis also reveals that China leads the way in total room nights from Asia to Singapore. In the European market, France and Italy lead the increase, due in part to improved connections. \n\nOlivier Jager, co-founder and CEO of ForwardKeys, said: “The overall picture emerging from our data is that Singapore’s 50 th anniversary celebrations are causing a holiday travel boom into and out of the country. \n\n“Total visitor nights in Singapore projected from the international air reservations that have been made are three per cent up on the previous year, and then up 5.5 per cent for the rest of the summer season, starting from the anniversary weekend.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:37:19.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
