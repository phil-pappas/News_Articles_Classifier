Adding to the restaurant’s cache, Morgan’s in the desert is the recent recipient of the coveted Wine Spectator magazine “Award of Excellence” spotlighting its diverse 3,000-plus-bottle-deep wine program.\nFrom Santa Barbara spiny lobster to Italy’s Alba white truffles, Baja shrimp and Hog Island oysters, the hyper-focused salute to fall’s finest is just a reservation away.

Things go south – so to speak – for the annual Baja Shrimp & Oyster Festival (October 15-29) with a sensory pairing of fresh Baja Shrimp and Hog Island Oysters plumped from rich summer waters.\nThe Squab & Pumpkin Festival (October 30 – November 11) pairs prized farm-raised California squab with its natural autumn counterpart, the pumpkin. November kicks thing up with the annual Duck & Pear Festival (November 12-25), a gastronomic marriage made in heaven as artisan duck and a medley of pears are coaxed into a peak performance. Next up is the salute to tom turkey on November 26 with three resort venues offering the ultimate traditional fare paired with all the Native American ingredients from our band of foragers.\nDecember means Alba truffles and nowhere is this treasured gem more coveted than chef Schmidt’s kitchen.
