We know that Everest is a huge draw for visitors – it is a bucket list destination.” \nTulasi Prasad Gautam, director general of the Department of Tourism, added: “The aim of the report was to develop an initial understanding of the extent of the damage from the earthquakes so that we could assess the overall safety of the Everest region’s trekking routes before the season starts in September.” \nIt was also welcomed by Darrell Wade, chief executive and founder of Intrepid Travel, who added: “As far as we’re concerned the report is all good news, because even where it’s identified issues it means that we now have the information needed to rebuild Nepal stronger than ever before, and ensure the safety of our staff, travellers, and the local communities we visit.” \nThe government report comes following last month’s one which identified “very little damage to the area in north-central Nepal, with the 3% of buildings damaged in the quake all ‘easily repairable’”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T07:23:08.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
