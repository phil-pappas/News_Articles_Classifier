Rosie O'Donnell's missing daughter found Page 1 of 1 \nA 53-year-old Luddite, I’m not expecting to climb aboard the Google bus anytime soon. I’ve made my peace with that. Good to know, then, that the perk of enjoying Silicon Valley from a passenger seat is available to anyone who can buy a Caltrain ticket. Some interesting sights are within easy walking distance of the train stops between San Francisco and Santa Clara, making it a totally doable day trip with kids too. And let’s face it, the fact that adults are allowed to imbibe on the train makes the prospect so much more inviting. The stations are noteworthy too: from the Art Deco Palo Alto stop to the 1863 Santa Clara station, where the first computer in Silicon Valley was installed. \nStart: San Francisco \nIf you’re coming from the East Bay, take BART to Powell Street and walk straight up Fourth Street. (If you’re taking the ferry from Marin, hop on BART at Embarcadero.) On your way to the Caltrain station, make a detour up to the fresh and friendly Twofish, and grab one of its signature sticky buns, breakfast calzones or a cold-brewed coffee, which soaks in cold water for 14 hours. Two Fish Baking, 240 Ritch St. www. twofishbaking.com ; Caltrain, 700 Fourth St. \nStop 1: Burlingame \nThe tiny Pez museum boasts examples of every Pez dispenser ever sold — more than 900 — plus a collection of games from 50 to 100 years ago, including a Dangerous Toys section. Among those games banned: Lawn Darts and a 1951 Atomic Energy Lab that was sold with four jars of radioactive material. Is it lunchtime yet? Grab a meatball sub from Sam’s in an old Greyhound bus stop, and picnic in Washington Park, just across the road. Burlingame Museum of Pez Memorabilia, 214 California Drive. www. burlingamepezmuseum.com . $3 adults, $2 children 4-10, free to children younger than 4 ; Sam’s Sandwiches, 1080 Howard Ave., Burlingame. www. samssandwiches.com ; Washington Park, 850 Burlingame Ave. \nStop 2: Menlo Park \nBrowse the shelves at Kepler’s Books, a 60-year-old institution that’s owned by the community. Each staff member has a shelf of recommendations; long-timer Nancy has a huge following in town. Plan a visit coinciding with one of the frequent author talks. Design aficionados will be intrigued by the ’60s-era splatter floor. A visit here is not complete without heading next door to Cafe Borrone and relaxing on their patio with a coffee frappe. Kepler’s, 1010 El Camino Real, www.keplers.com , www.cafeborrone.com . \nStop 3: Palo Alto \nTake a tree-lined 20-minute stroll to the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. The cafe is a beautiful place to look out over the Rodin Sculpture Garden — 20 bronzes are on view — while musing over a glass of wine. Now head up University Avenue to see the Internet billionaires on their lunch break. This place is like Mayberry on steriods — happy, shiny and even the trees here seem more idea-driven. Stop for some shameless kid-bribing at Rocket Fizz candy store. Then onto a must-see for technophiles, just a 15-minute walk away: the little HP Garage, considered the the birthplace of Silicon Valley and now a California historic landmark. Cantor Arts Center, 328 Lomita Drive at Museum Way, Stanford, www.museum.stanford.edu; Rocket Fizz, 250 University Ave., Palo Alto, www.rocketfizz.com; HP Garage, 367 Addison St., Palo Alto. \nDetour: Treat yourself to an Uber and head up to Thomas Fogarty Winery in Woodside, about a 30-minute ride from the station. (Use the winery’s directions, or you could find yourself arriving incredibly nauseated. The alternative roads are very twisty.) Perched atop the Santa Cruz Mountains with sweeping panoramas, this winery is known for its Burgundian-style Pinots and Chardonnays and offers two tasting flights. 19501 Skyline Blvd., Woodside, www. fogartywinery.com . \nStop 4: Mountain View \nEvery Sunday morning, the Mountain View Farmers’ Market sets up 170 stalls in the station parking lot. You’ll find “cosmetically challenged” apples, beet wellness cocktails, chocolate macaroons and Polish doughnuts made entirely without sugar, that morning. Take a picnic to nearby Eagle Park (650 Franklin St) . \nDetour: Rent a bike right next to the station and head off along the 5-mile path beside Stevens Creek which passes through community gardens and nature preserves. Besides breathing in eucalyptus and redwood trees you’ll see all manner of things along the way including NASA and ducks. www.bayareabikeshare.com; www.stevenscreektrail.org . \nStop 5: Santa Clara \nLevi’s Stadium, home of the 49ers, is a 10-minute ride on the Capitol Corridor train, which is next to the Stadium. Tours have been reimagined for the 2015 season as the Levi’s Stadium Super Bowl Stadium experience. The guided portion — which takes 90 minutes — goes through the stadium seating bowl, suite tower, locker room, field turf track and club spaces. The five Super Bowl victories are highlighted with vintage photographs, artifacts and storytelling. After that, you can opt to take a self-guided tour of the museum (suggested 60 minutes), an immersive look back in time that puts you shoulder to shoulder with life-size bronze statues of 49ers Hall of Famers and the five Lombardi trophies. Finally, you can end your day with a meal at one of chef Michael Mina’s two restaurants, Bourbon Steak or Bourbon Pub. 4900 Marie P. DeBartolo Way. Tours: 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Saturday, until 5 p.m. Sunday. $30-$35, available at www.levisstadium.com . \n— Jody Brettkelly", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T05:17:54.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
