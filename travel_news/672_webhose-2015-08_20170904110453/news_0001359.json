By Rowena Dumlao Giardina \nThe food culture in the Philippines is an integral part of the country. You might be surprised that one of the main activities of the Filipinos is to eat and for that, there is a plethora of restaurants in the country. And being food lovers, the Filipinos are not limited to the native kitchen but also to international cuisines. It is a melting pot of different tastes and flavors interpreted to the local palate. So when you are in the Philippines, the best thing to do is what the locals do. Go out and eat! \nBeing born and raised in the Philippines, I sometimes have the need to reconnect myself to my roots and true to the Filipino way, I always eat my way around. Just recently, I stayed there for a month and a half and this time, I put tabs on the restaurants that I would be returning to and to recommend to anyone who goes there. I won’t keep you waiting as I give you a random list of restaurants I tried and enjoyed. These are scattered about in the capital, a few may be off the beaten track but still places where any traveler can reach easily. \nPurple Yam: Malate, Manila If there is a place where you can learn the Filipino cuisine, this has to be the best place. Amy Besa, along with her husband Chef Romy Dorotan, the proprietor and chef of this restaurant, aim to educate their clients in the genuine Filipino cooking using fresh local ingredients with good quality. Expect a lot of twists to the traditional dishes but the results are always excellent. It’s must-try to get to know the cuisine. They are open on weekdays for lunch and dinner and Sunday brunch. Book ahead because this restaurant, situated in the couple’s ancestral home in the old part of Manila can only accommodate a handful. They also have a restaurant in Brooklyn, New York carrying the same name. \nGourmet Farms: Silang, Cavite near Tagaytay City When the concept of the restaurant is farm to table, expect freshness and excellent quality of ingredients. Chef Ico Molera prepares the dishes with the ingredients harvested straight from the restaurant’s immense garden giving the food an excellent quality of merging of flavors. The salads and drinks are as fresh and good as you can imagine them to be. (Facebook) \nBawai’s Kitchen: Tagaytay City Home-style Vietnamese kitchen. Vietnamese food like how it is in done in a kitchen with a mother’s love for cooking for her family. The restaurant was started by My Duyen or Bawai to her family (which means maternal grandmother in Vietnamese). Being Vietnamese in origin, she normally cooks Vietnamese food for her family and friends and by word of mouth, her popularity blossomed. If everyone wants to knock on her door for home cooked meals, then we all do too, right? The restaurant in Tagaytay was meant to be a vacation home for herself and her husband but as the popularity of her delicious home cooked meals became too demanding, she finally converted the place to a weekend-only restaurant in 2007. Currently, there are two other branches in Sta. Rosa, Laguna and Quezon City. \nMecha Uma: Bonifacio Global City, Taguig If you feel like having global cuisine with strong Japanese influence, then this superb restaurant ran by Chef Bruce Rickets should be your next booking.

The Breton galettes are made with buckwheat flour and filled with hams and cheeses and other savory ingredients. Aside from these, they also serve Filipino breakfasts, salads, soups, pasta dishes and main courses. End your meal (or start your day) with a sweet crepe and experience what La Creperie is all about.

They serve international dishes with major Austrian influences from Chef Gandler’s origin mixed with Filipino and other cuisines.
