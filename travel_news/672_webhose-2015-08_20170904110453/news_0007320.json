Source: Snapper Media \nFAMILY holiday to Disney World looking a little too cheerful? \nConsider a trip to Dismaland in the UK, a shadowy pop-up exhibition believed to be created by graffiti artist and political activist Banksy. \nAccording to the Bristol Post , the park, billed as a sinister version of Disneyland, sits on nearly 1000 square metres of land that’s been abandoned since 2000. The park reportedly contains a light pink — but very run down looking — version of Magic Kingdom’s Cinderella Castle, a large metal horse sculpture, a giant frayed pinwheel and various other sculptures. \nSpeculation about the twisted theme park has been rife since the area was closed off earlier this yer with notices alerting passers-by that Hollywood’s Atlas Entertainment production company would be filming a crime thriller called Grey Fox there. But no cameras or crew have been spotted on the site since. \nEarlier this month, Banksy manager Holly Cushing, who also served as an executive producer on Exit Through the Gift Shop — a film about the artist — was reportedly at the construction site talking to security members. The graffiti artist‘s latest show appears to be a sinister twist on Disneyland.

Banksy said at the time “the stunt was intended to highlight the plight of terror suspects at the controversial detention centre in Cuba”. Park officials removed the display after 90 minutes. \nThis story originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T07:24:06.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
