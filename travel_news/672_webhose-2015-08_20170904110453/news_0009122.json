Organised by the Event Hire Association (EHA) and Hire Association Europe (HAE), the exposition is the first of its kind to bring together hire businesses in the event, plant and tool sectors. Taking place at Holywell Park Conference Centre in Loughborough, September 22nd and 23th, the recurring theme throughout the event will be ‘Navigating your Future.’ \nThe two-day convention will set the scene for industry leaders to unite in their efforts in addressing the widening skills gap, attracting new talent, looking at key challenges in the industry and scoping the future. Anyone involved in construction, facilities management, maintenance and events will find a visit to the show hugely beneficial. With over 300 m2 of indoor space and an outdoor area for large vehicles, specialist equipment and demonstrations, delegates can expect to browse more than 50 exhibition stands. There will be a whole host of products and services on display including tool hire, plant equipment, utilities, Health & Safety advice, training providers, generators, lighting towers, portable sanitation, trackway and scaffolding. Some of the exhibitors confirmed to date include Calor Gas, JCB, Morris Site Machinery, Bosch Professional Power Tools & Accessories, Addex Group, Makita UK, Firefly Clean Energy, Belle Group, Karcher UK, Midland Power Distribution and Fein UK. The superb speaker line-up includes keynotes from Google, Arup, Raleigh International, Ramirent, HSE and JCB. The topics covered include: Sustainable Construction, Working at Height, British manufacturing, Dust Legislation, Robots revolutionising build and design, Google’s future trends and Youth Partnerships. There will be a number of smaller seminars taking place offering anything from asbestos safety to SafeHire certification. In addition, HAE will be running its first ever Future Hirer's Workshop, as part of the HAE EHA’s ongoing Future Hirer initiative. Backed by the CITB, it aims to encourage 18-30 year olds looking for work or a change of career to consider the hire sector. Craig Phillips, DIY Expert and TV Celebrity will be delivering a keynote session and hosting career workshops throughout Day Two. As part of a major boost in the support and commitment for attracting new people to the hire sector, HAE EHA is challenging itself to creating 2000 work experience opportunities during 2016, with 16 events planned nationwide throughout the year. Future Hirers will be launching ‘2016 – Year of Opportunity’ at the convention with the aid of a DWP Minister to emphasise the need for new employer-led initiatives. This year’s Hire Convention will also include an outdoor live demonstration area for the first time. Focusing on the latest products and innovations for the hire industry, Hilti GB, Marcrist and Makita have already confirmed their participation. The demonstrations will include advice of key safety issues including: reduction of dust, reduction of noise, reduction of hand-arm-vibration, the rise in cordless and rechargeable hand tools and high quality diamond cutting disks that don't explode. Graham Arundell, Managing Director of the HAE and EHA comments: “It’s vital that we explore the future of our industry, looking at the potential challenges we face and exploring projects that will help sustain it. The Hire Convention represents the perfect platform to bring everyone involved in the hire industry together, under one roof, to network, gain knowledge and be inspired. The venue is in a great location, with good transport links, minutes from the M1, East Midland’s airport and Loughborough rail station. It also has exhibition space, a lecture theatre and several meeting rooms in various sizes so lends itself fantastically well to the type of event we’re committed to delivering.” The registration fee for both members and non-members is £25. Delegate numbers are limited to 300 per day. Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:35:08.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
