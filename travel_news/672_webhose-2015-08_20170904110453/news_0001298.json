United Airlines said today it has upgraded its popular app to make navigating through the carrier's hub airport facilities easier â€” and more interactive. The upgrade, available now for iOS devices and soon for Android, includes interactive indoor maps for United's facilities at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, where the carrier has its largest hub, as well as Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.'s Dulles International Airport. The interactive maps were designed to help users search quickly for close-by airport vendors, including restaurants and ATMs or family restrooms. The maps also will help travelers navigate the maze of departure gates faster. If, for example, a customer has a boarding pass stored in the United app, the map will automatically default to start at the traveler's departure gate location. Alternatively, an app map user can place a pin at his or her current location at the United hub, and the app will guide customers to their desired destination. The app also will estimate walking time. United (NYSE: UAL) partnered with San Francisco-based tech start-up LocusLabs to develop the new app interactive maps. United also said it is testing Bluetooth low-energy beacons at its Newark Liberty International Airport hub. This indoor location technology will pinpoint a location, eliminating the need for a user to pin a location. And travelers who understand what a horror missed connections or flight cancellations can quickly become will appreciate that United is expanding booking features on its app. Through a few clicks, customers will be able to rebook flights, including those at another airport, or add themselves to a standby list for another flight. United's app has been downloaded more than 20 million times since its launch in November, 2013, and is one of the top-five travel apps in the Apple App Store. In 2014 United became the first United States airline to enable customers to scan their passports to check in for international flights via mobile devices, and United was the first airline to partner with Uber. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:08:42.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
