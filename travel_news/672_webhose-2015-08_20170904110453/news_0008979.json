The company forecasts modest growth in room occupancy through the end of the summer.\nThe numbers provide a snapshot of South Carolina tourism:\n___\nREVENUE, RATES PER ROOM\nFor the calendar year through the end of June, revenue per available room was just under $64.50. That's an increase of more than 8 per cent compared with last year. The average room rate in the state was just over $103, an increase of about 6 per cent compared with the same period last year. Nationally, the average room rate is $119.\n___\nROOM OCCUPANCY\nIn June, room occupancy was 73 per cent, an almost 2 per cent increase from June of 2014. For the first half of the year, South Carolina room occupancy was just over 62 per cent, again an almost 2 per cent increase over 2014. There's been about a 3 per cent increase in the total number of rooms sold in the state this year as compared to last year.\n___\nADMISSIONS TAXES\nFigures from the South Carolina Department of Revenue show that admission tax revenues, which include admissions to tourist attractions, were about $36 million through the end of May, up about 8.5 per cent from the same period last year.\n___\nHOT SPOTS\nA report released earlier this year by the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism estimates the state receives 29 million visitors a year. The most popular destination is Horry County, where Myrtle Beach is located, followed by Charleston.\n___\nTHE OUTLOOK\nSTR forecasts the occupancy rate statewide will be about 70 per cent this month, an increase of about a half per cent over August of 2014. The forecast for September is 62 per cent occupancy, up about 1.3 per cent over last year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T03:23:12.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
