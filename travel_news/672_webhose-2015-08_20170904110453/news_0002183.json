Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nFOR Rockhampton's Angus Emmerson it all started with homemade videos with his brother at the local skate park. \nThe skills he developed behind the camera helped him land arguably the best job in the world as a videographer travelling the beaches of Asia. \nBut after a year on this gig, he changed focus. \nAngus now works in the television industry as a production editor for Fremantle Media which is currently working on the next round of X Factor Australia. Angus, 23, said working for the travelling company was something he'd never forget and an important piece of his career so far. \n\"After working in a few reality TV shows in New Zealand, I was offered a job with a Canadian travel company that was based in Asia and worked with them for 12 months,\" he said. Photos View Photo Gallery \n\"I was the photographer, videographer and social media co-ordinator and within a week of accepting the job I was on the beautiful beaches of Thailand. My day-to-day job was to hang with all the Canadian travellers, take photos and create videos of the group activities all day, every day. \n\"I was definitely not looking for this job but it fell into my lap and was too good of an opportunity to pass up. \n\"I can easily say they were the best 12 months of my life. I would happily call it the best job in the world, for me at least.\" \nBut as they say, all good things come to an end.
