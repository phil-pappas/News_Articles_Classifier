We stayed at three of them and give you our verdict.\nElan Soho Suites\nWhere: 31 Woods St\nWhy: It’s new. The Elan Soho Suites is a 4.5 star hotel with a young, fresh vibe that opened earlier this year. A few streets back from the water and a short walk from Darwin’s main strip, it has 301 hotel suites and one and two-bedroom apartments spread across 26 floors.\nFeatures : Its clean, simple design is striking, with a red, white and black colour scheme, palm trees and contemporary artwork. A lap pool on the terrace on level six is partly shaded by buildings in the afternoon when I take a dip, but it is a pleasant space. There’s also a gym next to the pool.\nClean and a view ... the Élan Soho Suites. Source: Supplied\nThe room: My room on the 21st floor has views towards the harbour, a kingsize bed, a ceiling fan and airconditioning (always good to have a choice). A flatscreen television sits above the desk to the side of the bed, in front of two single sofas.\nFood: A Korean restaurant called Seoul Food on the ground floor also offers Western dishes. Lunch options include traditional Korean beef soup, an open steak sandwich or a burger with a soy-flavoured patty. Items on the dinner menu include a green papaya mango salad, Korean fried chicken, sweet potato gnocchi and steak with chips and vegetables.\nTip: The best time to visit the city is in the dry season, which lasts from April/May to September/October. The hotel has introduced free wi-fi for the dry season (until November 30), and mini bar packs are available to order.\nHow much: Rooms from $339 a night.\nelanhotels.com or ph (08) 8981 0888\nA new look ... the Élan Soho Suites in Darwin. Source: Supplied\nHilton Darwin\nWhere: 32 Mitchell St\nWhy: A $10 million upgrade has included a refurbishment of all 236 guest rooms, enlarging the gym and adding an executive lounge. Formerly the Crowne Plaza, this slick, central hotel is one of four in the Northern Territory to be taken over by the Hilton chain two years ago, and one of three in Darwin.\nFeatures: The large lobby has a stylish, sophisticated feel, and there’s a grey, black and white colour scheme throughout the property. It also has a pool on a terrace partly covered with shade sails, an undercover area with lounges and tables and modern banana lounges with cool side tables. Other guests include conference attendees, government staff and high-end leisure travellers, often heading off on trips on The Ghan or Kimberley cruises.\nImpressive ... a King executive room with a view at Darwin’s Hilton. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe room: It’s the little things that make a difference, and the well-designed layout impresses. Rather than having lamps everywhere, this one has a masterswitch next to the door so you can turn everything off in one hit. There’s a power point in front of the bedside table, so you can easily charge your phone overnight and have it within reach, reading lamps on either side of the bed, and a television.\nFood: Just off the lobby, Mitchells Bar and Grill has funky booths and tables and colourful cushions with a buffet breakfast and a menu based around fresh produce, including local fish and prawns. During the dry season there is a seafood display at dinner.\nThe room service menu includes wonton soup, fish and chips, a beef burger, butter chicken, pizza, barramundi and steak. There’s also a mini bar with cans of soft drink, 375ml bottles of Penfolds wine, Crown lager, Pringles and more.\nTip: Ask for a room on the water side so you have a view.\nHow much: Rooms from $279 a night.\nS ee hilton.com or ph (08) 8982 0000\nPlus entry ... the Hilton in Darwin that has had a $10 million upgrade. Source: Supplied\nNovotel Darwin Atrium\nWhere: 100 The Esplanade\nWhy: This four-star hotel’s 140 rooms were given a $5 million revamp last year, with new beds and bed head designs, connectivity for portable Apple devices and 91cm televisions.\nFeatures: The most notable feature is the jungle feel, with vines hanging over balconies, water features and palm trees. The aim is to “bring the Top End outdoors indoors”. The decor is a bit more dated than at the other two hotels, with a slight casino feel. But it’s comfortable, and in a great location at the end of The Esplanade, only one block away from the main drag of Mitchell St – close enough to be convenient but far enough away to avoid the backpacker bars.\nThe five-storey hotel has two glass lifts, which could be daunting if you’re afraid of heights. There is a pool on the ground floor and a Jacuzzi, while the ground floor restaurant, Zest, also has a lovely paved outdoor area at the front with hanging baskets.\nComfort ... the Novotel Darwin’s Atrium room. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe room: There are some advantages to staying in an older-style hotel. It’s the only one of these three that had a bath – one of the little luxuries I love when away. But my favourite thing about my harbourside junior suite is the rectangular-shaped nook with a window overlooking the park across the road and the ocean beyond. I’m happy to find a power point under the bedside table, and free wi-fi with a simple-to-enter password.\nFood: The room service menu includes Sri Lankan curry chicken, pan-fried barramundi fillet, a beef burger and club sandwich as well as tempting desserts such as warm sticky date pudding, chocolate mud cake and blueberry brulee cheesecake.\nTip: There isn’t a gym, but guests can get free passes to Time Out Fitness Centre, around the corner on Mitchell St.\nHow much: Rooms from $189 a night.\nSee novotel.com/darwin or ph (08) 8941 0755", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227462/168020-d1c80432-310d-11e5-82fc-375b5deeaed9.jpg", "http://www3.hilton.com/en/index.html", "http://www.novotel.com/darwin%e2%80%8e", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227462/168556-404b3024-0d95-11e5-a7cb-854c2b6b7d3b.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227462/168046-d0b86dca-310d-11e5-82fc-375b5deeaed9.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227462/168848-440ad818-0a8e-11e5-8933-556e3a23c467.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227462/168876-408ca1c6-0a8e-11e5-8933-556e3a23c467.jpg", "http://www.elansohosuites.com/default-en.html"], "published": "2015-08-01T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:53:28.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
