The travel and tourism industry in Pakistan is looking desperately for new opportunities to attract visitors to this beautiful but terror plagued and for westerners often unsafe country. \nThis is where opportunity bell ring from criminal gangs based in the UK, Germany or the United States. \nThe biggest child sex abuse scandal in the country has surfaced im its biggest case identifying at least 280 child victims. Child porn videos did surface in the United Kingdom, USA and many other parts of Europe. The scandal was detected in the district of Kasur in Pakistani Punjab province. \nSources claimed that local police have sold out the case and suspects had been released after bribing officials with 5 million Pakistani rupees (50,000 $). In addition families of victims had been subjected to pressure by corrupt local political figures to withdraw charges. \nThe Chief Minister Punjab on Saturday directed police to investigate the case impartially and also investigate the involvement of members of parliament (MP). \nOne villager who led the campaign to expose the scandal told media he had been warned he would be killed if he did not withdraw his claims. The gang is allegedly backed by police officials and local politicians. \nMost of the victims are under 14. Some recovered videos include a six year old boy forced to perform a homosexual acts and a 10 year old schoolgirl who was filmed being molested by a 14 year old boy. \nVideos of sex abuses were sold for Rs50 (50 cents) each in Hussain Khanwala village in Kasur district. \nThe abuse was orchestrated by a gang of up to 25 young men and teenagers led by two men in their 40s. \nThe gang used the videotapes of the assaults to blackmail the children and their families. Parents in shame hand over millions of rupees. Many of the children stole gold ornaments from their parents to pay off their abusers to keep their ordeal secret. \nThe abuse began in 2006 and continued until 2014. Police have seized more than 400 videos. Many of the parents have identified their children as victims in the films. Some of the clips showed that some of the victims were abused for more than an hour. In one clip five to six young men are seen molesting a seven-year-old boy. The ‘producers’ recorded the videos at different locations – in the open fields, washrooms, bedrooms, and at deserted houses. \nA 10-year-old victim said that he was taken to a Haveli (Farm House) by the gang at gunpoint. “After being brutally tortured, I was administered a “spinal injection” and I was dozing when five to six men molested me one by one,” he said. \nGangsters not only molested the children but they also asked the victims to rape each other on camera. “Everyone in this village is a victim. Our children both boys and girls are raped and blackmailed,” said a mother whose son was raped. \nAnother boy said he was molested by the same gang in 2006. \n“I was just nine years old when I was abducted and taken to a deserted house. I was brutally tortured. Then they administered a spinal injection. I was raped multiple times by several men at gunpoint. I decided not to tell anybody. Six months later, the accused showed me the video clips afterI refused to perform sexual acts on camera again. It was horrible,” he said. \nThe family of a ten year old girl forced to perform a sex act in her school uniform said they had paid a million rupees to their blackmailers but they had not erased the video.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T04:39:37.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
