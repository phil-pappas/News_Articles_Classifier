The inclusion of the Indian Destination Management Specialists in the deal provided Kuoni Group an opportunity to conclude a timely transaction at attractive terms. \n“We expect the closing of all transactions in the course of 2015, allowing Kuoni to focus on the further development of its core business”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:19:42.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
