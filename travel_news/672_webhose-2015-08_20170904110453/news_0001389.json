Some of these storms could become severe from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast. \n\"Warm and humid conditions will be in place across the Northeast into Monday and will lead to active afternoon thunderstorms from Ohio and West Virginia to northern New England,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Evan Duffey said. \nCities that could face storms include Pittsburgh; Syracuse and Albany, New York; Burlington, Vermont; and Berlin, New Hampshire. \n\"The main threats with these storms will be torrential rainfall, capable of causing flash flooding, damaging winds and hail,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Edward Vallee said. \nShowers and thunderstorms will move into the Interstate-95 corridor on Monday night, but they will weaken below severe limits prior to arrival. \nThe threat for showers and thunderstorms will shift to northern New England on Tuesday but will likely not reach severe criteria. However, a quick downpour is still possible and those with outdoor plans will want to keep an eye to the sky. \nThe cold front will follow these showers and thunderstorms and usher in cooler air for the remainder of the week. \n\"This shot of cooler air will lead to slightly below-normal temperatures across the interior Northeast for the middle part of the week,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Josh Searles said. \nAfter much of the Northeast faced intense heat and humidity for much of last week, the latter part of this week will bring cool and comfortable conditions. \nHigh temperatures across the interior Northeast will dip into the 70s Fahrenheit for much of the week, nearly 10 degrees lower than all of last week. \nAverage high temperatures across much of the interior Northeast are in the upper 70s to lower 80s for the beginning of August. \n\"High temperatures across the interior Northeast will be more typical of the beginning of September than the beginning of August,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Chyna Glenn said. \n\"The cold front will also reduce humidity greatly compared to what much of the region had experienced over the last couple weeks,\" Vallee said. \n\"Pleasant conditions will make for wonderful late-summer outdoor activities such as golfing, running and hiking,\" Vallee added. \nWhile the interior Northeast will face the cooldown earlier this week, the Interstate-95 corridor from New York City to Washington, D.C., will stay warm through the middle of the week before a sharp drop in temperature is felt. \nTemperatures will remain in the upper 80s to lower 90s through Wednesday before taking a tumble into the upper 70s and lower 80s on Thursday and Friday. \nWhile the cooler air will be welcomed after last week's heat wave, unsettled weather will also accompany it for the end of the week as a disturbance cuts across the mid-Atlantic. Unfortunately, rain and thunderstorms may spoil the arrival of the comfortable conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T06:16:52.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
