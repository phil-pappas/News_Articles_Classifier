Related Content 9 tourist attractions that are... \nWhile many of our planet's natural pits and crevices are dank and inhospitable, some contain inviting pools of crystal-clear water, are surrounded by spectacular scenery, and might even have a waterfall for showering off afterwards. \nWhether you fancy a dip in a sinkhole, a cave or a cliff-side cranny, TripAdvisor's latest list of the world's best natural pools should have you covered. \nIk Kil Cenote, Eco-Arqueological Park \nChichen Itza, Mexico \nVines cascading around the pool, pure blue water and schools of friendly catfish all combine to give Ik Kil Cenote in Chichen Itza an otherworldly quality. \n\"This place offers a swim like you're on another planet,\" says TripAdvisor user David T from Anaheim, Southern California. \n\"Dive into the water like it's your last swim in paradise. You won't find another like it.\" \nGrotta della Poesia \nRoca Vecchia, Italy \n\"You have to see this place to believe it -- when I first saw the pictures I wasn't sure it was real!\" says TripAdvisor user Chaitdesh from London. \nThe too-good-to-be-real Grotta della Poesia is in Roca Vecchia, an important Bronze Age and Mycenaean archaeological site. \nSitting on the Adriatic coast, the grotto is made up of two turquoise and blue karst sinkholes. \n\"When I arrived at the natural pool my breath was taken away by its beauty,\" says Joan R from New York City. \nLas Grietas \nPuerto Ayora, Ecuador \nThere is more to the Galapagos than gigantic tortoises. \nThere's the ocean water pool Las Grietas, positioned between two tall cliffs on the central island of Santa Cruz. \n\"It was the most amazing experience I ever had,\" says user Belepv from Buenos Aires. \"We could dive here and see the coral reef.\" \nBelepv offers a tip: \"Even if you can't swim you can ask for a life vest.\" \nVisitors have to take a boat ride from the main dock on Santa Cruz to get to the creek. \nVeterans suggest bringing your own snorkeling gear, but you can also rent equipment in Puerto Ayora. \nBlue Lagoon \nGrindavik, Iceland \nIt's obvious why the Blue Lagoon is a hit in chilly Iceland, just south of the Arctic Circle. This naturally heated geothermal pool has a constant temperature of 40C (104F). â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:57:26.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
