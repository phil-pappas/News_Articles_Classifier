State fisheries moved about 102,000 coho from the North Toutle Hatchery to Tacoma Power’s Cowlitz Hatchery.\nSome fish have been released into river and lakes along with agreement by co-managers. The Icy Creek Hatchery is releasing about 107,000 fall chinook that are around eight months old. The young fish should be able to survive an early release, and were originally supposed to be released in July of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T04:59:47.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
