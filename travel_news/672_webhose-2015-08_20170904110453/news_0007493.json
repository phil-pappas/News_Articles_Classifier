The A380, which can seat up to 494 people (eight in First class, 66 in Business and 420 in Economy), was chosen on account of the number of flatbeds and space available, since the trip involved extremely lengthy flights. Air Partner worked closely with Malaysia Airlines, the operator of the flight, to ensure that the players received a truly VIP flying experience with a first class service throughout. The team also enjoyed private and secluded VIP channels in the airports throughout their trip, keeping them away from the public eye. Clive Chalmers, Air Partner’s Director of Commercial Jets UK, said: “Air Partner has been organising charter flights for the sports industry for years and we have an excellent understanding of the travel needs of high profile individuals. We were delighted to once again use our expertise to provide a bespoke service for this extremely valued client and we hope to continue the relationship long into the future. We could not have asked for a better partner than Malaysia Airlines, whose team of dedicated staff worked tirelessly to ensure that the players enjoyed a truly VIP flying experience for the duration of the tour.” Air Partner’s Commercial Jets division organises bespoke charters and aviation solutions for groups of every size on airliners seating 20 or more passengers. Clients include the sports sector, conference and incentive industry, Oil & Gas, tour and cruise operators, international conglomerates, governments, and humanitarian aid organisations. Private charters are used for a wide variety of reasons such as product launches, country evacuations, global sporting events, troop movements, crew rotations, emergency replacements and package holiday travel.
