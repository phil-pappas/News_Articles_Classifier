You can bet they’ll be stylish and functional, but you’ll have to wait and see at the opening ceremony if they incorporate any of McCartney’s Fall 2015 faux fur. [ The Telegraph ]\nThe Band plays on…\nCLCC SA, the company to which Band of Outsiders is $2.5 million in debt, recently tried to auction off the brand’s intellectual property rights but was unsuccessful. This may be good news for fashion fans: The business now owns the label and released a statement saying, “CLCC SA believes in the Band of Outsiders brand and will continue to market Band of Outsiders in the U.S. and overseas.” [ Los Angeles Times ]\nVuitton’s London exhibition…\nLouis Vuitton has become known for its Series exhibitions, which guide visitors through every stage of making a collection for the house, from the creation of the clothes to the catwalk. The third of these shows, devoted to the Fall 2015 collection, will open in London this September, just as the Spring 2016 collections are coming out. Don’t expect a sober museum show, either. As Vuitton CEO Michael Burke emphasizes, “This is about a product that someone is going to buy and wear and make theirs.” [ Business of Fashion ]\nShop like a Mad Man…\nIt seems to be the season of TV show clothing auctions. Just after news broke that Jon Stewart’s Armani suits are being sold off, we now hear that a large number of Mad Men costumes are up for grabs. If you are a 42R, you could even have one of Don Draper’s famous suits—a bit more dapper than Jon Stewart’s, we must say. [ The Guardian ]\nIf you can’t beat them, join them…\nYou have probably heard about the recent flap between Jane Birkin and Hermès concerning a farm’s treatment of crocodiles. Now PETA, one of whose videos inspired Birkin’s protest, has taken matters into its own hands. While the advocacy group is famous for its sometimes- provocative tactics (notably, throwing paint at people), its new strategy is more genteel: PETA has bought a single share in Hermès, hoping that, by being admitted to shareholder meetings, it will be able to combat animal cruelty from inside the company.
