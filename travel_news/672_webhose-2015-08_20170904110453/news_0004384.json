An entrepreneur, surnamed Wei, has opened an innovative education institute at a business incubator in an economic-technical development zone in Qinhuangdao, North China's Hebei province after 10 years running a business in the capital. \"I commuted between Beijing and Qinhuangdao by rail for quite a time. I was struggling for money and with my health. Such a life is too tiring,\" he said. In February, President Xi Jinping called for the co-ordinated development of the region around Beijing to build a trilateral economic sphere in the Bohai Bay area. Qualified companies can also enjoy rent-free office space for six to 24 months... The Jing-Jin-Ji integration (Jing is for Beijing, Jin means Tianjin, Ji is traditional use as in Hebei province) has been planned as a national strategy to alter functions of the regions around the capital and ease congestion and pollution in Beijing. The planned megalopolis is meant to revamp northern China’s economy and become a laboratory for modern urban growth. The new region will link the research facilities and creative culture of Beijing with the economic muscle of the port city of Tianjin and the hinterlands of Hebei province, making it easier for the areas to work together. Qinhuangdao economic-technical development zone built up a base for scientific research institutes to relocate in May last year and a business incubator for high and new technology companies early this year. \"The incubator provides projects and start-ups with services such as an office, early investment and industry chain incubation. Qualified companies can also enjoy rent-free office space for six to 24 months,\" said Lyu Aiguo, deputy director of the management committee at the zone. Real estate agents meet potential clients at the entrance to a residential compound in Yanjiao (Picture: Song Wei/chinadaily.com.cn) Wei's company is one of the beneficiaries. \"My company enjoys preferential policies in many areas, such as registration. The office is also free of charge,\" said Wei. More than 10 companies have settled in the incubator, either branches of Beijing-headquartered businesses or set up by Qinhuangdao residents who used to work in the capital, said an incubator employee. A Qinhuangdao resident, surnamed Su, who worked for five years in Beijing following graduation, has bought an apartment in his hometown. \"Though Qinhuangdao offers less job opportunities and earnings than Beijing, I will come back as long as there is a favourable job here. Who wants to struggle one's life away from home?\" he said. With the construction of the cross-regional traffic network, a one-hour commuting circle is forming around Beijing, including Qinhuangdao. Like Su, many people plan to settle in Qinhuangdao, a pleasant coastal city, and are purchasing property. From the beginning of this year, house-buying groups from Beijing are made up of more and more young people, most of whom are Qinhuangdao natives who work in Beijing. They want to either live by themselves or give places to their parents, said a real estate agent, surnamed Liu. Many people's hometowns have new growth points and they are considering coming back... \"The situation is much different from several years ago. With the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, many people's hometowns have new growth points and they are considering coming back to look for a job\", said Liu. In an encouraging sign, housing loan policies have paved a way for regional integration. Qinhuangdao signed a deal in 2009 with Beijing allowing residents to use loans from Beijing authorities for buying a house in Qinhuangdao. \"Implementation of this housing loan deal benefits Qinhuangdao's geographical advantage with Beijing and the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region\", said Huang Jingdi, head of the credit and loan department of Qinhuangdao Housing Provident Fund Administration Centre. A total of 120 million yuan of loans in 470 payments were allocated from Beijing authorities for buying houses in Qinhuangdao as of February, according to the Qinhuangdao Housing Provident Fund Administration Center. The concept of the supercity needs strong infrastructure construction, especially transport The guideline for the co-operative development of the Jing-Jin-Ji regions was passed in April with more detailed policies and plans in the pipeline. According to the guidelines, Beijing keeps its position as a political, cultural, innovative and diplomatic centre while Tianjin works as an experimental research hub for R&D, global shipping, finance and economic reform. Hebei is set for industry transformation and logistics. The concept of the supercity needs strong infrastructure construction, especially transport. On 20 July, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced its plan to upgrade existing road construction to a new level - connecting all main highways and the public railway network. With the development of transport among the three regions, people in the Jing-Jin-Ji region will be linked easily. The development of high-speed rail with the average speed of 240km to 300km per hour makes it possible for people to commute between neighbouring cities within an hour. Telecom carriers will scrap roaming fees for cross-district phone calls around the region including Beijing, Tianjing and Hebei province from 1 August, according to a China National Radio report.
