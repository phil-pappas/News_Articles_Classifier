So getting prepared beforehand for this situation could surely prove to be a boon. \nWe all surely cherish the old times when free peanut packets were distributed in flights and every seat had a fluffy blanket for the air traveler’s comfort. But unlike those times, now the flights often charges extra money for snacks, meals and even blankets and pillows. The flight delays are quite common to all. You may come across some adverse situations as well when in the flight, so it’s important to be prepared beforehand, whether you are flying for a short or long distance. \nThere are some air travel carry-on items that can make your flight journey actually comfortable. \nSome vital medications and toiletries \nYou must include few vital things in your carry-on like medications with prescriptions in original packaging, antiseptic creams, moisturizers and lip balms. These kind of items are essential because you may need them when flight delays are long or your checked bag is lost. But for doing so, you would also need to abide by the flight security rules and regulations. If you are carrying liquid prescription medications, there are also separate norms that must be followed. \nSnacks and foods \nNow-a-days snacks are rarely offered for free so it’s a good idea to carry something to eat. But while picking the bring-along food be a little careful not to choose smelly foods that may irritate your co-travelers. Even be cautious about avoiding items that may not be permitted in your destination. Some food items like gums, candies and lozenges can even help you head-off ear popping during take-off and landing of flights. \nItems for entertainment \nThe types of entertainment or time-pass activity in a flight varies from traveler to traveler, some like to take a nap, some would listen to music and some other would prefer reading. So taking your own entertainment stuff can be useful. If you are looking forward to listen to music, carry your earphones which would save you from purchasing a new one in the airport. You must also get your gadgets fully charged before boarding a flight so that it doesn’t run out of life. Carry books, magazines or newspapers on hand as most of the airlines no longer offer them for free. \nCozy comforters \nYou may need something to wrap around when the in-flight temperatures drop, and the atmosphere gets quite chilly. So taking along a sweater, a jacket or a wrap in the carry-on bag would surely keep you warm. The traveler neck pillows are also very useful if you are going for a long flight trip. \nCredit Cards and other plastic money \nSometimes you may feel like having a bottle of water or a drink or watch some movie during the flight. So carry your credit cards and other forms of plastic money to purchase what you desire for. Even there are several airlines who refuse to take cash and only accepts credit card payment for food, drinks, entertainment and even Wi-Fi. \nSo just getting the destination planned properly and grabbing the tickets of flight in London is not enough for a traveler to have a decent, peaceful and comfortable flight journey.
