It's the rundown of Royal Caribbean's latest record-breaking cruise ship. Scheduled to launch in early 2016, Harmony of the Seas will be the largest cruise ship in the world. \nPart of the company's Oasis class of ships (which already includes two of the world's largest ships), Harmony of the Seas will measure 227,700 gross registered tons, carry nearly 5,500 passengers, have 16 decks and 2,747 staterooms. Its sheer size, however, is just one part of its noteworthiness. Harmony of the Seas is also filled with all manner of attractions and unique technology. \nTake for instance the interior cabins. For those who perhaps can't afford an ocean-view balcony room, there are virtual balconies. The technology involves LED floor to ceiling screens that provide live, ultra high definition views from outside the ship. \nHarmony of the Seas will also offer such things as a kids' water park and a slide that features a champagne bowl to swirl guests around as they approach the end of the ride. (And that's just one of the ship's three slides.) There's also the option to surf on one of the ship's two FlowRiders, play golf at the Harmony Dunes mini-golf course, zip line or rock climb. \nThe list of these sorts of offerings is endless and dizzying. \nAll of which begs the question, is this sort of larger-than-life ship, filled with over the top amenities, the new norm in the industry? Or perhaps it's just one example of even more sophisticated and technologically advanced ships to come? \nFor those who don't go on cruise vacations, it may be time for a quick update on the constantly evolving cruise industry and its various notable advancements. 1 of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T20:42:27.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
