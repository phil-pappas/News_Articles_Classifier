Ten mega trucks of 14 metres each (44 feet) headed to the venue with all the equipment. The arrangements and figures were a surprise to everyone: Four Seasons served 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds) of meat, and provided settings that included 22,000 pieces of cutlery, 21,000 glasses and 3 tons of ice. To mark the occasion, 960 place mats were specially embroidered with the event logo.\n“It’s an honour to be the official caterer of the New Suez Canal opening ceremony, to be part of its success and have our name associated with this historical event,” says Olivier Masson, Regional Vice President and General Manager of Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.\nBack at the Hotel, no celebration would be complete without unique flower arrangements in the lobby, created by the talented Four Seasons flower team to symbolise the theme of the New Suez Canal. In addition, guests were offered in-room surprises that showed the same theme, and a 90 metre (295 foot) Egyptian flag graced on the Hotel’s exterior.\n“Our team of experts at Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza is always behind the success of our phenomenal events, and here we were especially proud to cater for Egypt’s most precious gift to the world at the New Suez Canal Opening Ceremony,” says Masson.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T14:01:29.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
