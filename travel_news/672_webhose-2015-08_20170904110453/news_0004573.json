YOU MAY ALSO LIKE LATAM Airlines Group Announces Rollout of New 'LATAM' Brand Airlines & Airports \nThe site was launched earlier this summer and is comparable to a handful of other sites, including Shiroube and Tours by Locals. \nWhile travelers won't find tour guides for every city given the newness (there's only one listed guide for New York and none for Los Angeles), they will find a plethora of key information pertaining to the \"verified local\" tour guides in their chosen city, including photos, reviews, ratings and pricing. \nNavigating the site is incredibly simple and users are able to filter by travel dates and language. \nThe local tour guide profiles also feature \"About me\" sections that allow users to research guides and ultimately find one who shares common interests and languages. \nWhat's more users are likely to find affordable prices. Of course, on the flip side, travelers are unlikely to receive the immense expertise of a professional tour guide. \nFor example, Benny from New York speaks German and English and charges $13 per hour. Tour activities include sightseeing, visiting museums and exploring food and restaurants. \nSo far, local tour guides are available on Showaround in most of Europe's popular tourist destinations. However travelers visiting the U.S. will have to sift through a much more limited selection, as a handful of major cities are still awaiting their first verified local.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:26:35.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
