The new hotel will be operated under the Group’s premium brand, NH Collection, and will have 180 rooms, as well as dedicated meeting and event rooms. Due to open at the end of 2015, it will be the company’s third NH Collection-branded hotel in the city and its 10th in Italy. \nThe new NH Collection, located in the heart of Piazza Cinquecento, will be located in a heritage-protected historical building close to Rome's central train station, Termini, one of the country's most important transportation centres. The company plans to open this premium hotel in this strategic city-centre location, close to Rome's top tourist and business destinations, after completion of refurbishment of the palazzo at the end of the year. The 11,000 square metre building will be divided into four floors accommodating 180 rooms. It will also be fitted out with meeting and event rooms with capacity for up to 350 people and a bar and restaurant that can be accessed directly from the main square. The protected historical building will also boast spacious outdoor gardens featuring Roman ruins of the former Servian Wall, built around the city of Rome in the early fourth century AD. This new development adds to NH Hotel Group’s current portfolio of 53 hotels and more than 8,000 rooms in Italy, where the Group is the sector leader by revenue. Including this new establishment, NH Hotel Group will have 43 hotels operating under the NH Collection trademark around the world. The company’s premium brand is aimed at leisure and business travellers looking for extraordinary experiences with high standards of comfort and guest service in strategic urban locations across key international destinations.
