The contest runs through September 2, with grand prize winners announced on Baby Back Ribs Day.\nTony Roma’s helped start the Baby Back Ribs craze in the U.S. in 1972 when Chef David Smith decided to throw ribs on the grill and add his special BBQ sauce, what is now Tony Roma’s famous Original BBQ Sauce.
