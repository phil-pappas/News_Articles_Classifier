Don’t call it cocky.\n“We’re really confident playing with each other,” says Washington commit and senior Brandon Wellington .\nThe Crusaders should be.\nDespite losing their entire front seven to graduation and injury, they’re coming off a stellar season, one they capped off by snapping Bellevue’s 67-game win streak to claim the Class 3A state title.\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes When fire chief called for help, and no one was left State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid Sure, it’s too early to say how good Eastside Catholic will be this season — Wednesday was the first day of football practice for all Washington State high schools.\n“Anything can happen. I just want our team to play with a good effort,” says quarterback and Cornell commit Harley Kirsch , a senior who threw for 3,100 yards and 38 touchdowns last year.\nBut the defense looked sharp during 7-on-7 drills toward the end of a two-and-a-half hour practice in 90-degree heat.\nWellington stripped away two passes and Jonathon Webster (Columbia commit), Jonathan Kvech and JJ Luger each had interceptions. When other passes looked like they were there for the taking, but collected by receivers, Wellington barked encouragingly at his teammates.\n“Strip that! Catch that!,” he shouted.\n“We have to let everyone know that we’ve got to get the football,” Wellington said after the team’s first practice of the day.\nAnd, also, listen to his “Cacaws.”\nSolange Reyner : sreyner@seattletimes.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T04:20:13.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
