First place went to the Concordia Lightscape (pictured), which uses increasingly thick lines to show where the land stops and the sea begins\nThe winning entries comprise a Batman-style light that’s thrust into the night sky, a delicate construction that creeps into the sea and a ‘silent compass’.\n 2 Next Why dogs became man's best friend?

While they may not be realistic or ever be built, they are certainly attractive and bring innovative ideas about keeping people safe at sea.\nFirst place went to the Concordia Lightscape, which uses increasingly thick metal poles to show where the land becomes the sea. It's illuminated by solar-powered lights to glow at night.\nThe panel of judges, assessing the entries of the matterbetter Concordia Lighthouse Competition, said the winning entry (pictured) is a ‘very interesting concept with beautiful expression’ by duo Gwizdala Andrzej and Adrien Mans from Poland and Belgium respective\nThe panel of judges, assessing the entries of the matterbetter Concordia Lighthouse Competition, said the winning entry by duo Gwizdala Andrzej and Adrien Mans from Poland and Belgium respectively, is a ‘very interesting concept with beautiful expression’.\nArchitect Emmanuelle Moureaux said: ‘The idea of a \"dispersed\" lighthouse composed of \"lines\" totally redefines the typology of lighthouse, which is usually built as a massive and solid architecture.\n‘…The idea creates more than a lighthouse, it creates a \"lightscape\".\nThe 114,500-tonne Concordia, longer than the Titanic, was one of the most glamorous cruise ships to sail the ocean and boasted a casino, spa, several bars and dining areas. It sunk off the Isola del Giglio in Italy (pictured) in January 2012, killing 32 people\nDesigners submitting entries were asked to take into account advances in technology and sustainable systems and well as consider the metaphorical value of lighthouses. This illustration shows features of the Silent Compass\nJudge and architect Daria Polozkova said: ‘The design succeeds in preserving traditional architectural typology redefining the lighthouse by abstracting it to its symbolic qualities.' This elevation shows different uses on various floors of the structure\nFellow judge and architect, Cristina C. Murphy, said the design ‘reaches out to the “heart of the drama” and looks back toward the inhabitants of the island,' as well as acting like a secure hand to help visitors commemorate and confront the Costa Concordia disaster.\nJudges picked the winner from 282 entries. Architects submitting entries were asked to take into account advances in technology and sustainable systems and well as consider the metaphorical value of lighthouses, for example in being a beacon of hope for sailors weathering stormy seas.\n‘Lighthouse design should become a tribute to the Costa Concordia Disaster and highlight the vulnerable borders between the elements of Land and Sea, Sky and Ground, Light and Darkness,’ the guidelines say.\nA group of architects from Vietnam scooped second place with their Silent Compass design. This design (pictured) looks more like a traditional lighthouse, but with a glass body showing off a spiral staircase\nThe design (shown) includes a bar beneath an aerobeacon light and even a vertical farm. Different parts are designed to come into their own at different times of day, including the light from 9pm to 4am\nA group of architects from Vietnam scooped second place with their Silent Compass design.\nThis design looks more like a traditional lighthouse, but with a glass body showing off a spiral staircase.\nIt also includes café and bar beneath an aerobeacon light and even a vertical farm, with different features designed to be used at different times of the day.\nJudge and architect Daria Polozkova said: ‘The design succeeds in preserving traditional architectural typology redefining the lighthouse by abstracting it to its symbolic qualities.\nThe Silent Compass design includes café and bar beneath an aerobeacon light (illustrated left) and even a vertical farm. It's in contrast to Catharis proposal, which thrusts a large light beam into the sky, a little like in the Batman films\nJudge Emmanuelle Moureaux said: ‘The light-beam glowing vertically from the centre of circle connecting the sea and the sky, is strong and dramatic’ Batman (played here by Christian Bale,) uses a similarly powerful light to project his sign into the sky\n‘The proposed landmark becomes a symbol of the terrible event without evoking an oppressing presence, becoming rather a reminder for the future generations.\nTo some, the entry that has been awarded third place may look like it was inspired by Batman instead of a sea disaster.\nAn Italian team created the Catharis proposal, which thrusts a large light beam into the sky, much like the superhero uses to project his bat sign.\nJudge Emmanuelle Moureaux said: ‘The light-beam glowing vertically from the centre of circle connecting the sea and the sky is strong and dramatic.’\nThe design also includes a long path that snakes beneath the waves connecting to a horizontal ‘water circle’ floating on the sea, where visitors can dangle their feet in the water or look at to sea.\nMs Polozkova said the lighthouse justifies its name and is delicate and strong at the same time.\nThe Catharis design also includes a long path that snakes beneath the waves connecting to a horizontal ‘water circle’ floating on the sea (illustrated), where visitors can dangle their feet in the water as well as look out to sea\nMs Polozkova said the lighthouse justifies its name and is delicate and strong at the same time.
