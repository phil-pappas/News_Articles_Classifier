I was on my own and it was a very scary and difficult situation.”\nHelp came in an unexpected form: A small, black dog suddenly ran over and started barking at the men, scaring them off. It even followed her back to her apartment.\nShe believes the dog, which she has since named Pepper, was abandoned as she had seen it wandering around the town alone and trying to get the attention of tourists.\nPepper the dog who saved holiday-maker Georgia.

Then, it was time to go.\n“When we left to go to the airport, we looked back and Pepper was running after the car. It was heartbreaking,” she said.\n“When I got home I couldn’t stop thinking about her so I took the soonest flight back out that I could, which was two weeks later.”\nShe searched for the dog for five weeks, and eventually found it at Georgioupoli beach in Crete, the same place where she had been harassed.\nOnce it was confirmed to be a stray, Ms Bradley adopted Pepper and brought it back to the UK. It was a process that cost thousands, involving microchipping, a rabies vaccination, a pet passport and 21 days in quarantine.\nBut it was all worth it.\n“It has been such a crazy journey, but I am over the moon. Pepper has settled in brilliantly.”\nHappy together.
