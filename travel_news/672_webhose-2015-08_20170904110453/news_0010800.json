The unique feature of the Split Scimitar Winglet is that it uses the existing Blended Winglet structure, but adds new aerodynamic scimitar tips and a large ventral strake. \n\"GOL has always been a valued customer of APB and has operated with Blended Winglets on its Boeing Next-Generation 737 airplanes for over a decade,\" said Christopher Stafford, Aviation Partners Boeing director of sales and marketing. \"GOL will now be able to take advantage of a significant reduction in fuel requirements as well as an enhanced payload and range capability with the Split Scimitar Winglets System. This improved airplane capability will open new routes and opportunities for GOL.\" \nAPB has now developed and certified the Split Scimitar Winglet System for all commercial variants of the Boeing Next-Generation 737, including the: 737-700, 737-800, 737-900, 737-900ER and Boeing Business Jets. \n\"The Split Scimitar is aligned with GOL's way of thinking about business: focusing on maximum efficiency of its equipment through sustainable solutions. With the expansion of international routes to South America and the Caribbean, GOL has the opportunity to get the best benefit from this solution developed by APB, mainly on fuel savings for longer flights,\" said Andre Cruz, head of fleet at GOL. \"In addition, the aircraft that are receiving the Split Scimitar Winglets are being positioned to support the transition to the Boeing 737-MAX starting in 2018.\" \nAPB's Split Scimitar Winglet program is the most successful product launch in its history. Since launching the Split Scimitar Winglet program in early 2013, APB has taken orders and options for 1,919 systems. Over the last ten years, APB has sold nearly 8,000 Blended Winglet Systems. More than 6,600 Blended Winglet Systems are now in service with over 200 airlines in more than 100 countries. APB estimates that Blended Winglets have saved airlines worldwide 5.2 billion gallons of jet fuel to-date thus eliminating over 55 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. \nAviation Partners Boeing is a Seattle-based joint venture of Aviation Partners, Inc. and The Boeing Company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T03:18:02.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
