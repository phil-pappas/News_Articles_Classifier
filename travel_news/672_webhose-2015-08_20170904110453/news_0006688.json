(Kyodo photo) - + WAKAYAMA, JAPAN â€” A local Japanese railway, which mourned the death in June of a cat credited with rescuing it from financial difficulties by serving as a stationmaster, appointed another cat as its successor Tuesday, hoping the feline legacy will continue attracting passengers. \nWakayama Electric Railway Co issued a letter of appointment for Nitama, a five-year-old female cat, to become the master of Kishi station. Like her predecessor Tama, Nitama is a calico cat. \nThe railway also unveiled the Tama Shrine, a Shinto shrine that enshrines Tama as a deity protecting the once-money-losing Kishigawa Line in Wakayama prefecture, western Japan. \n\"I hope (Nitama) will contribute to boosting local sightseeing and other businesses,\" said president Mitsunobu Kojima. At the funeral for Tama, who died aged 16, Kojima said she was a \"savior\" for not only his company but also for many other small railway operators struggling financially in rural parts of the nation. \nNitama receives a letter of appointment to become the stationmaster of Kishi station of Wakayama Electric Railway Co on Tuesday. (Kyodo photo) \nNitama had been Tama's subordinate since January 2012 when she was appointed acting master of the station. \nWearing a stationmaster's cap as she was held in the arms of the president, Nitama \"offered prayers\" to the shrine and \"reported\" her promotion to Tama's soul while many fans looked on. \nYukako Nakahashi, a 42-year-old office worker from Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, said Nitama \"looked more dignified than when I saw her a few years ago, and she seems to have got more used to her job.\" \nThe shrine, which is located on a platform at the station, is equipped with two small bronze statues of Tama with beckoning paws, one for drawing passengers and another for money. \nIn Japan, a cat is used as a figure for Maneki-neko, or beckoning cat, a good luck charm bringing prosperity to shop owners. \nKishigawa Line had been losing passengers and on the edge of closure before Tama became the master of Kishi station in January 2007. \nHer cuteness and the novelty of a cat stationmaster attracted tourists from in and out of Japan, and the success sparked a trend of appointing rabbits, cats, dogs and other animals as stationmasters among local railways across Japan. \nThe animals are kept at stations to delight passengers and tourists. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
