Their long occupation of the area is evidenced by many indigenous sites, making the reserve among the richest in indigenous heritage in the Sydney region.\nThe explorative walk will be hosted by an Aboriginal discovery ranger, who will tell stories of the local indigenous tribes and their culture, and aim to give a fresh look at the landscape from a Koori perspective.\nThe tour on November 7 coincides with the 10-day Campbelltown City Festival of Fisher’s Ghost, which is one of the longest running community events in Australia, celebrating its 60th birthday this year. Indigenous perspectives and relationships to land feature in the legend of Fisher’s Ghost, when an Aboriginal tracker named Namut was called in to help find the body of the missing murder victim, Fred Fisher.\nThe 2km walks will begin at 9am and finish at 10.30am, and cost $5 per person. Bookings and ticket pre-payment is essential and places are strictly limited. The grade of the walk is easy to medium, with a few loose surfaces. Participants are advised to wear comfortable walking shoes and a hat, and to bring a water bottle with them on the day.\nSource:-Dharawal National Park", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:47:10.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
