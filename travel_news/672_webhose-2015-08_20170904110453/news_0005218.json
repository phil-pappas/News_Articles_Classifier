The map shows the places where we see the most incidents. \n\"There literally is danger at every turn, be it in the pool, in your food, on the stairs or outside the front of your hotel. \n\"A nasty stomach infection can attack the lining of the stomach, dehydration can affect the kidney and liver.\" \nBut it's not just Spain to avoid, apparently. Holiday makers travelling to Greece were warned of moped and car accidents, sexual assault and violence on the streets. \nAnd in Turkey he claimed the 'major dangers' included slips, trips and water slide incidents. \nThis falls in line with the Foreign Office's report stating more than 17,000 Brits have ended up in A+E abroad in the last five years. \nTourists have ended up in hospital after being involved in accidents, illness or violence. \nCould this be the beginning of staycations for cautious Brits? New stats show, back in 2013, a huge 67 per cent of the nation decided to stay put during the holidays, and enjoy the sights of Britain. \nJust 32 per cent of people travelled abroad to enjoy the sunshine - and that figure could decrease after the recent revelation about former holiday favourites Spain and Greece.
