I was not at all aware that students wud do this (sic),” Kejriwal posted on Twitter.\n“I am told it has been a practice in del govt to form visual formation of whoever chief guest is (CM or LG). I agree this is a wrong practice. I will stop this practice forthwith,” he said in a series of tweets.\nReacting to the episode, Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai said, “We enquired about it and came to know that it’s a tradition. This has been happening which is not right.”\nThe government also released pictures showing similar designs — one showing Najeeb Jung’s name and the other Sheila Dikshit’s — created on previous such occasions.\n“I think it is deliberate mischief. Last year school children had displayed LG’s name at I-day function. Before that name of CM was regularly displayed at I-day celebrations. School children displayed variety of placards, why selective targeting?” a government spokesperson said.\nThe pattern came up few times during Kejriwal’s 40- minute-long speech, where he highlighted his government’s “achievements”, punctuated with loud cheers from the students.\nWhile state Congress chief Ajay Maken decried it as a “shame”, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay condemned the government for “politically misusing” the Independence Day function.\nBJP National Secretary RP Singh said, “It is very clear that the Chief Minister is a megalomaniac who can see none other then himself.”\nLawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan , who was earlier expelled from AAP, tweeted, “From crs on personality cult promoting Kejriwal ads to ‘Jai Ho Kejriwal’ instead of Jai Hind. Shameful Megalomania.” (sic)\nSocial media, where images in this regard went viral, heaped scorns on AAP saying the government’s justification was not befitting as people expected change from Kejriwal.\n“Ppl voted for change, the change they expected from Arvind Kejriwal as an ‘Aam Aadmi’,” Anshi Chhibber tweeted.\n“Previous govts did it. Yes, they have been voted out, so is ur target the same?” Krupakar Manukonda wrote.\n 15, 2015 7:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:08:08.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
