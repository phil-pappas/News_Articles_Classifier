It is known not only as the birthplace of famous artists, conquerors and architects but also as the land of bullfighters, flamenco dancers and great chefs. Our members know that nothing replaces actually being there and experiencing a destination for themselves.”\nADE attendees will see the whole Andalusia region where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Mediterranean Sea. ASTA is excited to take attendees to the European continent next year after traveling to Africa earlier this year for the Destination Expo in Morocco, and to North America in 2014 when it was held in Merida, Mexico.\nMore details on the show, accommodations and travel discounts on Iberia to Seville, a city exploding with life and color, will be revealed in the coming weeks on ASTA.org/ADE. Agents attending the ASTA Global Convention Aug. 29-Sept. 1 also will hear more about the country and ADE from Spanish tourism representatives, and receive on-site discounts to the Expo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:04:46.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
