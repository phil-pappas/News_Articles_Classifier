I realised straight away what it was,” Baker said. “I was so shocked, I didn’t know what was going on - I thought it was maybe some kind of practical joke at first. \n“I put it on loud speaker so Matt could hear and we had no idea what was happening. \n“I was really confused, both of us were. It’s a bit weird, but quite funny. \n“I [was] transferred to the flexible trips department. I was put on hold - and when it picked up it was a sex line.” \nBaker quickly hung up, and called Thomas Cook again the following day. \nLauren spoke to the manager, who told her the operator had mistakenly dialled 0844 instead of 0800 and said it was a ‘genuine error’. \nMatt caught the whole incident on camera, and the couple saw the funny side and shared the video on Facebook. \nAlthough unable to get her money back for the original error, the couple since booked another hotel, which Baker said Thomas Cook had refunded and the couple go to Amsterdam on Friday. \nA Thomas Cook spokesperson said: “Thomas Cook always seeks to innovate with a view to providing a quality experience across the holiday journey, and offers its customers the opportunity to ‘try before they buy’ in many instances. From expert retail agents offering personal recommendations to our use of varied technologies including online videos and Virtual Reality headsets in our travel shops, we are dedicated to ensuring our customers know what to expect from their preferred destination when choosing to travel with us. \n“In this instance, the link-through to the sex chat line was caused by human error, and is in no way indicative of any desire on Thomas Cook’s part to reflect certain aspects of what customers might expect when travelling to Amsterdam. \n“Thomas Cook would like to apologise to Ms Baker and Mr Geddes for any offence caused, and can confirm that it will be transferring their erroneous booking from Rotterdam to Amsterdam free of charge.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T17:10:32.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
