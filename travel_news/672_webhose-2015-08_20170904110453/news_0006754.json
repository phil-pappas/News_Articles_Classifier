Photograph by: Rebecca Blackwell , The Associated Press \nIn the pantheon of Mexico’s pre-Hispanic gods, most Aztec deities are depicted as brutal, bloodthirsty beings only appeased by human sacrifices. \nBut this month Mexico’s Templo Mayor museum put on display an exhibition dedicated to Xochipilli, the Aztec god of singing, dancing and the morning sun. \nThe Aztecs usually sacrificed quails to Xochipilli, rather than still-beating human hearts. And he was worshipped at vast poetry and music festivals rather than martial displays. \nMuseum director Patricia Ledesma said the display is meant to show another side of deities worshipped by the Mexica people. \n“This is part of what we wanted to show, that the Mexicas didn’t just do warlike or bloody things, but also artistic things,” Ledesma said at the opening of the exhibit of pieces unearthed in 1978 at a small shrine on one side of the sprawling Templo Mayor complex in Mexico City . \nThe exhibit is unusual in that it consists of miniature stone carvings of musical instruments – rattles, drums, whistles and flutes – and for the red colouring doused over many of the objects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:44:16.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
