The average middle-aged man probably wouldn’t think of a visit to a water park as his number-one choice of weekend activity. But take the kids for an afternoon of watery fun and your opinion might just change. There are few more liberating sensations than whooshing down a waterslide to the accompanying squeals of delighted children. Despite yourself, you’ll feel the cares of the world quite literally wash away as you splash around, generally making merry with your nearest and dearest. Even better, water parks offer year-round fun. Many are under cover, making them the perfect venue for a wet weekend. Meanwhile, at the height of summer, an outdoor park provides the ideal way to cool down and enjoy the sun. A quick internet search can help you narrow down your options and find the best water park for your family. Some are on caravan sites or holiday camps, but are open to non-residents. It’s worth calling ahead to confirm opening hours – especially out of season – and get information about any age restrictions. As a general rule, water parks offer a network of pools and a wide selection of slides, jacuzzis, whirlpools, inflatables and fountains to enjoy. Some of these are only suitable for children over a certain height, so you’ll need to read the signs carefully in order to keep your kids out of harm’s way. If you have the teeniest sense of adventure, you’ll be unable to resist the lure of the foaming water For some parents, this is the biggest challenge of a water park adventure. If you take a party of children – perhaps your own offspring and a handful of their friends – you’ll feel as if you need eyes everywhere. So it’s worth inviting a couple of adults along to assist. That way, you can share the responsibility, and may even have a chance to enjoy the odd slide yourself. If you have rather more refined tastes, you can be a shade artful in your choice of location. Recognising the need to cater for all age groups, a good number of water parks provide steam rooms and saunas for adult visitors. This provides you with a place to unwind while the kids cause havoc in the pool, ensuring the day is as relaxing for you as it is for them. That said, if you have even the teeniest sense of adventure, you’ll be unable to resist the lure of the foaming water. And your kids will be thrilled at your derring-do if you take on the challenge of the sheerest slides or the tallest dive boards. Just remember to pack enough trunks, swimsuits and towels for everyone in your party and you can’t go wrong. It’s also worth making sure you have plenty of snacks, or know the location of the nearest café or ice cream parlour. Swimming burns a lot of energy, and you’ll most likely have a hungry horde on your hands the minute they get out of the pool. It’ll be a happy horde, though, full of tales from their day in the wet stuff. Go with the right attitude, and you may discover that water parks are the perfect place for some mid-life fun, too.
