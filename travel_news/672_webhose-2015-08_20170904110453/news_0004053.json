By Susan Montoya Bryan ASSOCIATED PRESS • Sunday August 9, 2015 5:00 AM \nSANTA ROSA, N.M. — In an otherwise arid stretch of eastern New Mexico is a seemingly bottomless deep blue swimming hole with quite a reputation. \nLegend has it that outlaw Billy the Kid would take a dip in the Blue Hole before heading into Santa Rosa. Weary railroad workers and passengers followed at the turn of the century, and then travelers along Route 66. \nThe artesian spring, tucked into a rock outcropping just off the highway, pumps out 3,000 gallons of water a minute. \nThe bell-shaped spring gets wider as it gets deeper. At the bottom, about 80 feet down, a metal grate keeps divers from going any farther into the maze of caves that sits below it. \nThe cave system has been sealed off since 1976, when two divers in training died after getting separated from their classmates. \nToday, tourism officials highlight Blue Hole in the New Mexico True campaign, which identifies the state as a place for outdoor fun. One video features young, fit hipsters in trunks and bikinis diving and dancing in slow motion into the Blue Hole. The bravest of the bunch leap from the natural diving boards that surround the sinkhole. \nLifeguards are on duty, and locals will offer encouragement if there’s any hesitation about jumping. \nNot up for a thrill? Use the concrete steps to reach the water. \nOr if you want to see what it looks like beneath the surface, diving classes are available. \nDivers from around the region flock to Blue Hole for fun and certification. It’s one of the best diving spots in the Southwest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:55:22.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
