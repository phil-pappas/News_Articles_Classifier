PUBLISHED: 11:31, Thu, Aug 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:53, Thu, Aug 20, 2015 FORREST HOLIDAYS Forrest Holidays \nAnd this is especially true if the wood in question has a luxury holiday hideaway nestled within it. \nArriving for a weekend with Forest Holidays was a very pleasant surprise for my family and I – even if there were no bears carrying picnic baskets scampering through the woods. \nForest Holidays – part owned by the Forestry Commission – has selected some of the most stunning forests and woodlands in Great Britain to create nine eco-resorts where families and friends can relax and enjoy weekend breaks and longer holidays. \nLuxury cabins and tree houses with panoramic views of the forest and loads of outdoor activities to keep the family entertained are the company's speciality. \nAnd then there’s the jewel in the crown - the private hot tubs available with many of the cabins which you can enjoy year all round while soaking in the peace, tranquillity and beautiful scenery around you. Sheer bliss. PH Forrest Holidays Blending harmoniously with the woodland surroundings, our Silver Birch wood cabin was the perfect base from which to relax, have fun and enjoy the stunning setting \nMy husband, three children and I, enjoyed a three-night break at Forest Holiday’s 63-cabin Thorpe Forest resort in Norfolk. \nOpening last year, it is the newest resort in the Forest Holiday portfolio, and follows the winning formula in existence since the company was created in 2006. \nHidden in woodland on the banks of the River Thet, close to where the Norfolk and Suffolk borders meet, the forest is a delicate patchwork of pines, heathland and broadleaf trees, and home to a rich variety of native British wildlife, including deer, squirrels, pheasants, woodlarks and nightjars. \nBlending harmoniously with the woodland surroundings, our Silver Birch wood cabin was the perfect base from which to relax, have fun and enjoy the stunning setting. \nThe stresses and strains of the rat race – and the two-hour car journey on a Friday rush hour to get to our break - began to melt away as soon as we started winding our way down from the main road in to the heart of the forest. \nIt was pure escapism from the hustle and bustle of the city. Forrest Holiday Cropton Forrest \nFollowing a quick visit to the Forest Retreat to check in, we opened the door to our stylishly designed, three-bedroom cabin, threw on our swimming costumes and headed straight for the hot tub. \nIf you’ve never luxuriated with a glass of fizz in a tub of warm bubbling water, in the middle of a forest, with the air temperature a few degrees above freezing, then I highly recommend it. \nAll you need to do is sit back, breathe deeply and gaze at the stars shimmering through the faint steam drifting into the night sky. \nWe all agreed the tub was one of the highlights of the holiday and a great selling point. \nAnd we were not the only ones enjoying a nocturnal dip judging by the pockets of steam coming from the gently lit verandas of cabins dotted through the woods. \nIf pampering is high on your wish list, as well as enjoying multiple visits to the hot tub, you can also pre-book a wide range of in-cabin treatments. \nWith two-year-old twins, a five-year-old boy and husband to entertain, such treats were not possible for yours truly on this occasion (note to self: must come back with the girls for some me time). \nBut there was plenty else on offer to make this a break which I want to do time and time again. FORREST HOLIDAYS Cycling through Forrest Holidays resort \nThere are all kinds of outdoor activities, both on-site and in the surrounding areas. \nThe majority of Forest Holidays locations have a dedicated Forest Ranger in charge of a programme of events from night-time treks to bush skills. The kids really enjoyed the nature trail. \nYou can also book active adventures such as pony trekking, kayaking and 4x4 off-road driving. \nThere are also forest trails to cycle and woodland walks to follow if you fancy exploring on your own. \nThe local area also offers an array of attractions, from the beauty of the Norfolk Broads to the medieval charms of Bury St Edmunds. \nThe friendly team down at the Forest Retreat have lots of local knowledge and can point you in the right direction. \nIf the weather isn’t favourable for venturing out, all cabins are stocked with traditional board games. At the newest locations, there are also state-of-the-art entertainment systems to enjoy the latest film blockbusters, thousands of music titles, and internet access. \nThe cabins, which are decorated in bold modern colours, are well appointed with all the fixtures and fittings you’ll need to cook up a treat. \nBut if you don’t fancy cooking, you can order a delicious pizza for delivery to your cabin from the Forest Retreat. The retreat also has a store which offers a wide range high quality local produce, hot snacks, and drinks from the café bar which can be enjoyed in front of a log burning fire.
