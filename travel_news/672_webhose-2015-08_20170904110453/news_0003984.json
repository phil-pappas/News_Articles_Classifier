The research reviewed here demonstrates that violent video game use is one such risk factor,” the report said.\nIn light of the task force’s conclusions, APA has called on the industry to design video games that include increased parental control over the violence the games contain.\nThe task force conducted a comprehensive review of the research literature published between 2005 and 2013 focused on violent video game use.\nThis included four meta-analyses that reviewed more than 150 research reports published before 2009.\nTask force members then conducted both a systematic evidence review and a quantitative review of the literature published between 2009 and 2013.\nThis resulted in 170 articles, 31 of which met all of the most stringent screening criteria.\n“While there is some variation among the individual studies, a strong and consistent general pattern has emerged from many years of research that provides confidence in our general conclusions,” Appelbaum said.\n 15, 2015 11:22 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T10:20:35.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
