Currently, there are two auctions running, one to Seoul and another to Bandung. \n\nSyed Mohd Razif Syed Mohd Yasin, group managing director of Sri Sutra Travel, said it took the company three years and RM3 million (US$767,800) to develop this portal. \n\nHe said: “ Sutra.my is a one-stop travel booking portal where you can book more than just flights and accommodation. It offers convenience to Malaysians who can also contact the company to make amendments to their bookings. \n\n“Being locally owned and developed, Sutra.my will help channel funds from around the world through our local gateway. This way, money flows through Malaysian banks because the automated online booking enables funds to be streamlined towards and processed by Malaysian banks.” \n\nIn the coming months, Sutra.my will also offer tickets to shows in Malaysia and the UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:03:30.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
