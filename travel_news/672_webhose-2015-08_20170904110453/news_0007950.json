Lynden International/Lynden Air Freight was rated highest in the value and equipment & operations categories and finished in first place among 23 service providers.

The results provide customers with a definitive ranking of companies by category and those that finished above average.\n\"To be voted No. 1 by our customers for a third year is something to be proud of and affirmation that we are on the right track with our service, equipment and performance,\" says Lynden Transport President Paul Grimaldi . \"We face many regulatory and operational challenges in the LTL industry, but we pride ourselves on maintaining the Lynden brand of customer service no matter how tough the challenges and obstacles.
