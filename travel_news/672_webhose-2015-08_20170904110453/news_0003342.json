The oompah bands, the men in lederhosen, the girls in dirndl skirts and the kind of blouses guaranteed to stop traffic.\nThe giant fairground, the heaving crowds, the noisy singing of drinking songs and pop anthems.\nOh, and the endless arrival of stein after stein of foaming lager, served up 12 at a time in oversized glasses, each containing a litre of beer, carried by strong young men and cheery barmaids whose ability to carry the drinks belied their frames.\nI had just survived the last night of the world-famous Oktoberfest in Munich and the full picture was still emerging from a hazy mist of bleary-eyed recollection and a slowly clearing head.\nOh what a night, as the Four Seasons song goes. Oktoberfest has been celebrated for more than 100 years and what started as a wedding celebration for Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and his bride Theresa has become the biggest annual party in the world.\nGetty Tasy: Food platter at Oktoberfest, Munich\nIt is definitely a bucket-list event and one I am glad to have finally got under my belt.\nStaying at the luxurious Maritim Hotel in the centre of Munich, I was a comfortable 10-minute walk away from the festival site. At least it was at the start of the night. I’ve no idea how long it took to walk back – but I was certainly in good company with the many thousands of revellers who turn up during the 16-day festival.\nDuring that time more than 6.5million litres of beer – all brewed in Munich – are sold. That’s around 11.5million pints.\nOf the 14 large tents and 20 smaller venues, the Hofbrau-Festhalle is the largest, holding around 10,000 guests per session. You can choose a daytime session or an evening one, starting at 6pm, but it’s essential to get a table.\nWe spent the night in the Schottenhamel tent which holds around 5,000 people, many decked out in traditional costume, sinking stein after stein of Spaten beer.\nAnd we all got well and truly Shotten-hammered!\nLager lager: Steve Purcell (left) and friends at Oktoberfest\nSchottenhamel is the oldest and many say the most important of the tents – they are more like giant hangars, erected for Oktoberfest and then dismantled again – as it is always where the event begins.\nAt exactly 12noon on the first day of Oktoberfest, the mayor of Munich receives a 12-gun salute as he opens the first barrel with the words “O’zapft is” meaning “It’s tapped”. Only then can the other tents begin to serve.\nEach tent serves its own beer – Paulaner, Hofbrau, Lowenbrau, Augustiner, Spaten and several others – and there’s no point asking for a half!\nYou can find wine in one of the smaller tents, but we’re only here for the beer. The carnival atmosphere fills the city and the build-up of excitement is like getting yourself ready for a major football match.\nExcept that at Oktoberfest you will rarely see any trouble, despite the huge amounts of alcohol being consumed every day.\nGetty Beer here: Revellers in traditional Bavarian costume at the Schottenhamel beer tent\nThe Red Cross even has special “hangover tents” on hand for those who really overdo it.\nEven during the afternoon session you will see people – women as well as men – being carried back into the city by their pals.\nTraditional food is everywhere, from Hendle (roast chicken), to Schweinshaxe (pork knuckle), Weisswurst (white sausage) and, of course, sauerkraut!\nYou won’t go hungry, that’s for sure, and a giant pretzel is never far from your reach. The steins of lager cost 10 euros a time, but you’re getting nearly two pints’ worth of a premium-strength beer for that.\nAnd it is all brewed to the strict German purity laws so, to be honest, the hangover needn’t be that bad.\nWe flew with Lufthansa to Munich’s modern and very efficient airport, which is around 40 minutes by train from the heart of the city centre, with bus and taxi options, too.\nGetty Double Barrel: Traditional parade at Oktoberfest, Munich\nBut if you want to travel farther afield, it is well worth hiring a car to explore the beautiful Bavarian Forest region.\nA couple of hours from Munich is the Arberland region, with Bodenmais, known as the pearl of the Bavarian Forest, at its heart. It is the easternmost holiday resort area of Germany and borders the Czech Republic.\nIt is an area of outstanding wild woodland with hundreds of miles of hiking and mountain biking paths, clear mountain rivers, and a family-friendly skiing area in the winter around the Grosse Arber mountain.\nAn overnight stay at the Hotel Tagungshaus in Regen gave us time to sample the delicious food at the Bohmhof 1 in Bodenmais, where I enjoyed a deer stew, and visit a wood-carving workshop where Sebastian Von Zulow and his family have been making hand-crafted artefacts for generations.\nThe area is also famous for its crystal glass. At the Joska Kristallwelt in Zwiesel you can try your hand at glass-blowing, as well as pick up some exquisite souvenirs.\nOne of the hidden gems of Bavaria is the magnificent Hartl Golfing Resort at Bad Griesbach. It is the largest golf and thermal health spa resort in Europe. And it is well worth British golfers checking it out.\nGetty Fair cop: A swing ride and Ferris wheel at Oktoberfest, Munich\nFor a start, the 2015 European Open is going to be played there on the Franz Beckenbauer course next month, one of three designed by former Ryder Cup captain Bernhard Langer.\nWith the Mercedes-Benz Course, Brunnwies, Uttlau and Lederbach courses, the resort has five championship-standard challenges plus golf tuition in the giant Golfodrom.\nThere are two four-star hotels, the Ludwig and Furstenhoff, and the five-star Maximilian.\nI played the stunning Brunnwies course, with one of the finest views in golf off the 10th tee, but with so much choice in one resort, it could easily be the perfect golf break destination.\nBack in Munich we did a walking tour of the city, taking in the famous sights, including the square where a rabble-rouser called Adolf Hitler was arrested and jailed.\nLunch was at the famous Ratskeller restaurant which opened its doors in 1874 and is now a favourite of Munich’s movers and shakers.\nBut that was all a prequel to the big event of the trip – a night at the Oktoberfest. Now, I’ll drink to that!\nGet there The 2015 Oktoberfest opens on Sept 19 and runs to Oct 4. oktoberfest.de\nLufthansa flies to Munich from Heathrow, Manchester and Birmingham from £99 return. lufthansa.com\nRooms at the Maratim Hotel in Munich start at £74.50pn r/o inc free wi-fi and use of the wellness centre. maritim.de\nRooms at the Hotel Furstenhof in Bad Griesbach start at £71pn B&B. hartl.de\nRooms at the Hotel Tagungshaus Bayerischer Wald in Regen start at £25.70pppn B&B. tagungshaus-bayerischer-wald.de\nTourist info: muenchen.de and bavaria.by\nTime zone: UK +1hr\nCurrency: Euro £1 = 1.40\nBest time to go: Wish brew were here in late September?\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.oktoberfest.de/en/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.bavaria.by/", "http://www.tagungshaus-bayerischer-wald.de/", "http://www.muenchen.de/", "http://www.hartl.de/", "http://www.maritim.com/en/home#", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "http://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage"], "published": "2015-08-01T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:27:09.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
