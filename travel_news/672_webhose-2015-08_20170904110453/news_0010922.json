The middle 20 per cent? Just 1.8 per cent. \nObviously, most people can’t afford such over-the-top vacations. The median household income in the United States is $52,250, according to the Census Bureau. \nSo The Associated Press is offering the closest thing — a virtual reality tour of some of the world’s most extravagant accommodations: suites on a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380, Cunard’s duplex stateroom aboard the Queen Mary 2 ocean liner, and the Ty Warner Penthouse suite at the Four Seasons hotel in New York. \nTrust us, we didn’t get to spend the night either. \nEach space was extensively photographed using the Matterport Pro 3D camera, and then reconstructed for use in virtual reality. Users are able to “walk” through and explore every part of the locations and experience these exclusive locations firsthand. \nHOW TO VIEW AP’S SUITE LIFE EXPERIENCE \n— View the interactive 3D experience online here .— For a virtual reality version of this experience visit the Oculus Store using the Samsung Gear VR and download “The suite life.” Original source article: The suite life: A virtual tour of some of the most-expensive and exclusive ways to travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T11:33:56.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
