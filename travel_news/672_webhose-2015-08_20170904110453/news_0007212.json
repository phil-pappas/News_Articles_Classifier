Reports from the SLO County Air Pollution District and Health Department say air quality has also been heavily impacted by the amount of smoke. Related Content Brush Fire Burning Along Highway 101 Near Buellton \nThe fire broke out around 1 p.m. Monday along the Cuesta Grade east of Highway 101 and south of Santa Margarita. As of 10:00 p.m., it was at 500 acres and 10 percent contained. \nCounty officials ask the public to limit outdoor activities if you smell smoke or see ash, in order to reduce potentially harmful health effects. These precautions are especially important to people with respiratory and heart conditions. \nFine particulate concentrations are higher than normal and the air is considered hazy. Officials say levels may be high enough for even healthy people to be effected. \nOfficials urge anyone experiencing cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, exhaustion, light-headedness or chest pain to seek medical attention. \nThey say they cannot predict specifically where the smoke will travel due to weather conditions, but will continue to closely monitor smoke impacts. \nCopyright Â© 2015 NPG of California, LLC.
