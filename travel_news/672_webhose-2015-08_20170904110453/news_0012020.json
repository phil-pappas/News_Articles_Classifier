Credit: flickr.com/ Bob Adams \nFollowing outrage over flight booking issues, FlySafair has decided to extend its crazy R1 sale. \nThe airline announced the sale, which sees flights sold for R1 (including taxes), on Tuesday morning. \nHowever, soon FlySafair's site was inundated with traffic - which resulted in most customers being unable to book the special flights. \nThe airline has since announced that the sale will be extended due to the technical issues. FlySafair has yet to announce the exact details, but has assured flyers that there will be an extension. Details to follow soon. \nThe announcement has been welcomed by social media users. \nThe airline faced sharp criticism on Tuesday for allegedly not being prepared for the sale. The airline said it had doubled its server capacity, but had received 30 times its normal traffic due to the sale. \nThe airline's rating has decreased on Facebook as a result of the bad publicity, with many users giving the airline one star due to the technical issues. The airline's rating is now 2.3 out of 5 stars. \nIts Facebook and Twitter pages have also been flooded with criticism from users. \nFlySafair has sold over 5 000 tickets in the sale, which is limited to 30 000 tickets. \nWhat has your experience with the sale been like?
