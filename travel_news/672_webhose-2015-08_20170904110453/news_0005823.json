We had the best in flight crew on West Jet. Laughed so hard. Only had a chance to video the French portion of the pre flight instructions ! Enjoy, we certainly did ! \nPosted by TM'z Veterinary Clinic on Saturday, 1 August 2015 \nA video of McAdam delivering a hilarious safety demo on a trip from Las Vegas to Regina was posted to Facebook by Saskatchewan-based TM'z Veterinary Clinic on Aug. 1. Since then, it has drawn almost five million views. \n\"We had the best in flight crew on WestJet,\" the post said. \nThis isn't the first time that McAdam has been filmed delivering a standout safety demo. Here's another video of the attendant that was posted to YouTube in 2011. \nBut WestJet attendants don't just demonstrate. They can also do a mean dance to \" Uptown Funk .\"  FUN FACTS ABOUT THE MAGIC PLANE According to WestJet, it took a team of 26 people 24 days working around the clock to paint the Magic Plane. The painting crew was made up of people from four countries, five states, two provinces and 12 cities, according to WestJet. WestJet estimates that over the course of the next five years, the Magic Plane will fly more than 400,000 travellers nearly eight million kilometres. According to WestJet, the cookies served on board of the Magic Plane will be in the shape of Disney characters. WestJet says the two sides of the plane are mirror images of each other, in all aspects but one. The company would not say what that is. A total of 36 different colours were applied to the aircraft, says WestJet More than 150 donuts were consumed during the painting of the Magic Plane.
