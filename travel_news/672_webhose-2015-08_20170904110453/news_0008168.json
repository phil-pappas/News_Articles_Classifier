One of the key enabling systems for the success of both is the provision of real-time data to vehicles, drivers, and pedestrians through vehicle-to-external communications (V2X) using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC).\nGlobal demand for new vehicles is projected to continue growing over the next decade, particularly in developing markets where dense urbanization is already causing problems with traffic congestion, accident rates, and air quality. Even before there is significant deployment of automated vehicles, V2X connectivity has the potential alleviate some of these issues. DSRC-based V2X systems are anticipated to be deployed by OEMs beginning in 2016 and see rapid expansion over the next decade. In addition to the embedded OEM systems on new vehicles, aftermarket retrofit systems and new smartphones with DSRC capability are expected to be adopted. According to Navigant Research, global revenue from sales of OEM and aftermarket DSRC-based V2X systems is projected to reach more than $36 billion by 2025.\nThis Navigant Research report examines the market for connected vehicles, with a focus on the key components of V2X communications technology and factors that may influence successful deployment. The study provides an analysis of how these factors, including the cost of hardware, regulations, potential societal benefits, and security and privacy concerns, are projected to affect OEMs, hardware and software suppliers, regulators, and intelligent transportation infrastructure operators. Global market forecasts of OEM and aftermarket sales of DSRC equipment for light, medium, and heavy duty vehicles, broken down by vehicle segment and region, extend through 2025. The report also provides a review of major market drivers and barriers related to connected vehicles and key industry players within the competitive landscape.\nKey Questions Addressed:\nHow big is the potential OEM market for vehicle-to-external (V2X) communications globally and regionally?\nHow will aftermarket V2X systems, including built-in and smartphone-based solutions, help drive the development of vehicle connectivity?\nWhat are the key forces driving the deployment of V2X-connected vehicles globally?\nWhat are the possible roadblocks to reaching the full potential of V2X communications?\nWhat are the pros and cons of various technology solutions for connected vehicles?\nWhich companies will play a critical role in the deployment of V2X communications?\nWho needs this report?\nAutomobile, truck, and bus OEMs\nFleet operators\nTier One and aftermarket automotive electronics and software suppliers\nAftermarket automotive electronics retailers and installers\nTelecommunications providers\nIntelligent transportation system suppliers\nGovernment regulators\nInvestor community\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p02861525-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution that finds, filters and organizes the latest industry data so you get all the market research you need - instantly, in one place.\nhttp://www.reportlinker.com", "external_links": ["http://www.reportlinker.com/", "http://www.reportlinker.com/p02861525-summary/view-report.html"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:17:39.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
