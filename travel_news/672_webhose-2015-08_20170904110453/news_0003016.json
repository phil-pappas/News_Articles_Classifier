First off you want to seek out a tour operator that specializes in safaris . Safaris are made up of multiple components which are difficult to book and figure out on your own. The logistics of getting from A to B in remote areas are best left to those who know their airstrips and border crossings from firsthand experience. You also want to make sure you are visiting the right countries at the right time of year for what you want to see and do. Below are some key questions to get you on your way to enjoying a wonderful safari in Africa. Anouk Zijlma 1. When is the Best Time to Go on Safari? \nIf you have a flexible schedule, your safari specialist can tell you what the best time of year is to see as many animals as possible. If you are a keen birder, this will differ from those of you who are more interested in seeing the \" Big Five \" . If you want to plan a beach vacation before or after the safari, then you may want to check out the \"shoulder seasons\" when it's a bit warmer (dry seasons are cooler at many safari destinations). Love baby animals ? Then you may want to aim for a \"wetter\" time of year, but in an area where you are still guaranteed to see a lot. Want to see the \"great migration\" without the crowds? Ask your safari specialist when and where that would be. More » Bushtops 2. How Much Will the Safari Cost? \nWhen you get a price from your safari operator, make sure it includes all taxes (VAT etc), all park fees, all transfers, internal flights, meals, drinks and activities listed. Find out what tours and activities are optional, and get an idea of pricing. Have a budget in mind before you ask someone to plan your safari for you. Obviously this is not easy as the accommodation and safari styles vary enormously. But a good quality safari with good guides will run $500 - $1,000 per person, per day. You can go over that for more luxury accommodation or for more expensive destinations like Zambia and Botswana. But ideally don't go under that price-point. Rather save up another year and do it right, or shorten your stay by a day or two if you don't have the budget. You can also try \"low season\" when prices drop for deep discounts. Adding nights in Cape Town, Victoria Falls and at the beach will allow you to add more days to your trip, at less cost per day. © Anouk 3. How Long Should I Go For? \nThe ideal time for a safari proper, when you are going out on game drives twice a day (or bush walks) is probably around 7 days. But if you are a wildlife nut you may want to go longer. And if you are planning on a driving safari only, then you will also need longer. Ask your safari operator what they suggest for what you want to see and do, and also how much money you have to spend. As with the comments above, it may be worth shortening your safari time for a better quality experience. A three week budget trip with a group in a minibus through Kenya's national parks is not going offer the same wildlife viewing as 10 days in private conservancies in open jeeps with flights between camps. Shorter can sometimes be better. More » Anouk Zijlma 4. Group or Private Safaris - What is on Offer? \nIf you like small group travel, there are plenty of small group safaris out there to choose from. But note this does not always come at less of a price and is not any \"safer\" than going on a private safari where you determine when and where you would like to go. The fun of group travel is meeting other like-minded people and for singles this may be especially appealing. But a safari is a social activity anyway, many lodges encourage dining together, and your safari activities are usually shared with other guests. Private safaris can offer a wide range of destinations and is much more flexible to suit your individual interests. You will always be accompanied by a professional wildlife guide while on safari. Private safaris also have the benefit of staying at smaller lodges. If you are offered a private safari, note it usually still means you \"share\" your game drives and activities with other guests at camp unless you pay extra for your own guide and vehicle. More » 5. Planning a Family Safari? \nIf you are planning to bring your children on safari , it is very important you let your safari operator know how old your children will be at time of travel. Many lodges have discounts for children sharing with their parents, but just as many have age restrictions. Smaller lodges and camps are often unfenced and it is dangerous for children under a certain age to stay there. Some lodges accept children but will make you pay for a private vehicle throughout your stay. Some safari camps will make it mandatory for one adult to sleep with one child in the room/suite for safety reasons, if they are under a certain age. Family tents and lodging at smaller more luxurious camps are premium real estate so book early!
