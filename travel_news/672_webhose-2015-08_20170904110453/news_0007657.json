As a centre-piece development spearheading the revitalisation of Darling Harbour, Four Points by Sheraton Sydney Darling Harbour was a key component in the BESydney IAB schedule for 2015.\nBESydney CEO, Lyn Lewis-Smith said, “The development of Four Points by Sheraton Sydney is quickly taking shape and will complement the new, dynamic Darling Harbour convention precinct that will open in late 2016. It’s part of a program of renewal and transformation taking place across the city that we were proud to showcase to our International Advisory Board members.”\nThe redevelopment of Four Points by Sheraton Sydney, Darling Harbour is one of Sydney’s most ambitious projects in recent years, driving the wider revitalisation of Darling Harbour as a world class meeting destination and addressing the current demand for hotel rooms and convention space in the city centre. Scheduled for completion in May 2016 for the convention space and October 2016 for the additional tower, the new-look Four Points by Sheraton Sydney will offer a total of 23 flexible conference, meeting and events spaces. Two pillar-free ballrooms offering natural light and views over Sydney’s Darling Harbour will have capacity for 1,000 in the maritime ballroom and 1,100 theatre-style in the grand ballroom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:32:43.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
