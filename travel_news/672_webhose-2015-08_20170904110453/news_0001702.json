It is T5’s first non-British Airways’ lounge. \nThe 4,000 sq ft lounge is being operated by Priority Pass owner Collinson Group and ground handler Swissport. It is open daily from 05.00 to 23.00. \nPriority Pass members will have access to the lounge as part of their membership, while non-members can use the lounge for three hours for £35 when booked in advance through executivelounges.com or £40 at reception on the day, subject to availability. \nThe lounge, which was first announced in April, features windows on two sides overlooking the runway, a British-inspired seasonal food and drink menu including both complimentary and premium options for an extra charge, and the Bliss Spa at Aspire offering a range of facials, manicures and pedicures with appointments of either 20 or 40 minutes. \nOther facilities include ‘rest pod’ reclining loungers, workstations with wifi , charging posts, showers and dedicated quiet zones. \nErrol McGlothan, general manager of Collinson Group, said: “Using insights gained from frequent travellers, we are confident that we’ve delivered the most compelling destination lounge where travellers can relax and refresh ahead of their next journey.” \nHeathrow property director Stephen Wilkinson added: “We now have independent lounges in each of our terminals. Our team works tirelessly to ensure our customers receive the very best when they fly and we’re delighted that Aspire, The Lounge and Spa at LHR T5, at Terminal 5 will enhance this service.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:04:41.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
