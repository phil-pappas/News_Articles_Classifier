Now, judges will decide whether they want to hear oral arguments or can decide the case based on the court documents already submitted.\nThe South Carolina Ports Authority wants to replace its aging cruise terminal with a new one by renovating an old waterfront warehouse. The permit allows placing additional pilings in the water beneath the warehouse.\nAn administrative law judge upheld the permit last year, but conservation and preservation groups appealed. They contend, among other things, a new terminal will hurt the quality of life in historic Charleston.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T02:01:04.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
