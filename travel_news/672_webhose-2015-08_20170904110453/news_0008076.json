The images reveal a glimpse of the hotel’s signature restaurant, Quinto La Huella, a guest room, and the pool. \nStaying true to the brand’s DNA, the hotel will offer a distinctive and unconventional experience for individually minded travellers who seek innovation, style and personalised service. It will be the hotel group's first property in the United States and the third hotel under the EAST brand, after the successful openings of EAST, Hong Kong in Island East in 2010 and EAST, Beijing at INDIGO, Beijing in 2013. EAST, Miami is deliberately designed to be different. Designed by award­‐winning architecture firm Arquitectonica with interiors by New York-­based Clodagh Design, EAST, Miami will offer 352 guestrooms to include eight suites and 89 one, two­, and three-­bedroom residences, which are essentially long‐stay hotel rooms with kitchen, laundry facilities and access to the amenities and services of the hotel. Ranging in size from 300 to 1,800 square feet, all rooms, suites and residences will feature balconies, contemporary interiors, and floor-to­‐ceiling windows with spectacular views of Miami and Biscayne Bay. EAST Miami’s signature restaurant, Quinto La Huella and the hotel’s rooftop bar, Sugar are designed by Los Angeles-­based Studio Collective. Guests of EAST, Miami can expect to experience the local community’s eclectic and international street life, art installations and urban culture showcased throughout the property. \"Brickell is a burgeoning area for young professionals and cosmopolitan tourists alike. Our brand caters to the tech-­enabled, modern traveler and EAST, Miami will offer guests advanced amenities and services that suit their needs,” says Brian Williams, Managing Director of Swire Hotels. “Guests will feel energized and comfortable here as we’ve designed this hotel with cutting-­edge technology, design, guest room and pool options, and lively restaurants and bars to enhance their lifestyles and travel experiences.” Created for unconventional travellers looking for a fun and relaxing place to stay, EAST, Miami will feature a paperless arrival and departure service as well as a one-­stop, front­‐desk Guest Experience team.

The hotel’s premiere lobby café and bar, Domain, will feature freshly brewed coffee, light bites and an array of fine wine & spirits. Swire Hotels will bring its award­‐winning expertise to the restaurant and bar mix by offering guests a traditional Uruguayan parrilla experience at its signature eatery, Quinto La Huella.

On the 39th floor, the hotel will feature a 3,400 square-­‐foot ballroom known as The Crush, with 270 degrees of ocean and urban views. The Shrubbery and Sugar are ideal for any outdoor events and occasions, thanks to Miami’s all-­‐year round tropical climate. All of EAST, Miami’s event spaces will feature floor-­‐to-­‐ceiling windows, complimentary WiFi access, the latest audio-­visual equipment, and technical support. To complete the ultimate guest experience, EAST, Miami’s state-­‐of-­‐the-­‐art fitness center and pool deck will accommodate every guest’s needs. The hotel’s gym, BEAST (Body by EAST), will feature the latest equipment and will be accessible 24-­‐hours a day to cater to guests’ preferred fitness regimen. The unprecedented 20,000-­‐square-­‐foot outdoor pool deck area will feature four unique pool experiences (lap pool, spa pool, cold plunge and hot tub) so all guests can utilize the space. EAST, Miami is nestled in the heart of Brickell City Centre and between the eclectic and culturally rich upscale areas of Brickell’s urban neighborhood of greater Downtown Miami and South Florida's major financial district.
