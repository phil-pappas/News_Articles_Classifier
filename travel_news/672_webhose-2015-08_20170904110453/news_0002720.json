On Wednesday, Zipcar Inc. , an on-demand car rental service owned by the Avis Budget Group Inc. , rolled out two vehicles at KCI that are available for hourly and daily rental: a Honda Civic sedan and Honda CR-V compact sport utility vehicle. Lindsay Wester , a spokeswoman for Zipcar, said the two cars will be stored at the Avis facility located off London Avenue just north of the airport's terminals. The location is the company's second in Kansas City. It set up two cars at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in early 2012. Zipcar was purchased by the Parsippany, N.J., company (Nasdaq: CAR) for $473 million in 2013, according to its 2014 annual report . The news of Zipcar's arrival comes one week after San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc. signed an agreement with the Kansas City Aviation Department allowing the ride-hailing service to pick-up passengers at KCI . RELATED: Deal lets Uber pick up passengers at KCI Wester said Zipcar is a membership-based service accessed either online or through the company's smartphone application . After paying a $25 signup fee and receiving the \"zipcard\" key card, car rental costs $10 an hour or $79 per day. Membership dues are $7 a month or $70 a year. The company is already at more than 50 airports, in more than 400 cities around the world and says it has more than 900,000 members globally. Wester said the company does not share rental data. \nWant Kansas City Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
