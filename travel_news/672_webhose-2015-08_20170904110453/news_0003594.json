Through a global collaboration, we are putting the spotlight on shark conservation while taking a proactive step to build the population.” \nPaul Hamilton, general manager and curator of Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, added: “We are committed to raising awareness on conservation issues both locally and internationally. It is exciting to take a trailblazing role in the fight to save the Sand Tiger Shark species. We are hopeful that our efforts will set a research benchmark in assisted reproduction of sharks as well as inspire aquariums globally to develop skills to self-sustain their inhabitants.\" \nHe said techniques learnt in Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo will likely be applied to the conservation of sharks worldwide. \nAs part of the programme, Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo expects to set scientific protocols in areas including the handling of Sand Tiger Sharks, sperm collection and its cryopreservation, ultrasound monitoring of female sharks and hormone analysis to assess their reproductive cycle, the artificial insemination process and potential live birth of pups. \nA full-fledged cryopreservation lab has already been set up in the Underwater Zoo and the sperm collection will commence in the coming days. It will be stored at the cryopreservation lab until the female Sand Tiger Sharks within Dubai Aquarium are ready for the assisted reproduction. \nThe project will be led by research consultant Dr Jon Daly who, together with The Aquarium vet, Dr Rob Jones, made history at SEA LIFE Melbourne Aquarium in 2013 with the birth of a Brown Banded Bamboo shark – the first ever shark in Australia to be born via artificial insemination. \nA full-time research veterinarian is on staff at Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo to oversee the assisted breeding programme and other conservation based initiatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T13:09:32.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
