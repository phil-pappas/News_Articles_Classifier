The Taste Our Best Award is given to restaurants and dining venues who strive to deliver sustainable, high quality, local, fresh food and ingredients on a daily basis for their customers. \nGary Rice, General Manager of the Beardmore Hotel and Conference Centre, commented on the award saying: “At the Beardmore, we pride ourselves on sustainability and quality, making sure that all of our delegates and guests can enjoy a relaxing meal while attending a conference, or just winding down at the end of a day. “All of our produce is sourced from suppliers who show an active dedication to supporting the welfare of animals and the environment, taking into account issues including waste reduction, delivery and packaging and other negative and harmful effects on the environment.” The Beardmore has a proven track record in sustainability, receiving the Green Tourism Gold Standard for the last four years. The Clydebank venue has consistently delivered an excellent quality of customer satisfaction, recently being inducted into the TripAdvisor Hall of Fame and receiving their fifth consecutive VenueVerdict Gold Accreditation. Gary added: “Our team work extremely hard to make sure we are continuing to deliver to a constantly high standard, and it is an honour to be recognised as a world-class dining venue by VisitScotland. “Along with constantly reviewing and updating our menu, we have recently completed a revamp of our lounge, patio and garden area, adding the essential ‘little touches’ to make sure we are always offering the most enjoyable, comfortable and tastiest dining experience possible.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:57:57.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
