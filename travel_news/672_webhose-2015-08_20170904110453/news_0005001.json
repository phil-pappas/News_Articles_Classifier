Any booth will display an exhibitor's product, company or destination to tourism stakeholders and key cruise line decision makers, but specialized pavilions will increase attention and allow a destination or large company to showcase their numerous offerings. Additionally, private meetings with cruise executives will be available in the pavilions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:40:25.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
