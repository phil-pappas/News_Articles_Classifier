It's breathtaking! - Yelper Risa Y Yelp Fullscreen Aamodtâ€™s Apple Farm: www.yelp.com/biz/aamodts-apple-farm-stillwater Photo: Three dollar tractor rides by the vineyard. - Sarah H More reader comments: Picking apples is nice, but really, ignore the utilitarian value for a moment and realize that this is a place to JUST BE. Seriously, close your eyes and explore the apple scent and the wood scent with your sniffer. Go outside and do the same. Smell the leaves and feel the warm, dry, Minnesota fall sunshine on your neck. - Yelper Justin T Yelp Fullscreen St Croix Boat & Packet Co: www.yelp.com/biz/st-croix-boat-and-packet-co-stillwater-2 Photo: St Croix River Boat. - Bak J More reader comments: As I think back on the boat cruise what sticks out in my mind is how ALL of the staff were authentically welcoming, friendly and accommodating. The scenery, well, thank you Mother Nature! The St Croix River in the summer is a wonderfully relaxing way to kick back and enjoy an evening. - Yelper Kristi C Yelp Fullscreen Oasis Cafe: www.yelp.com/biz/oasis-cafe-stillwater Photo: This one is mine! Denver Haystack. :) - DeAnna J More reader comments: The menu is full of great, creative breakfast items. Unique to River Oasis is their haystackers, which is two eggs on top of a bed of hash browns and is loaded up with cheese and other ingredients depending on which haystackers you order. I ordered the Oasis haystacker which came with ham, bacon, sausage, green pepper, and mushrooms. I added their delicious sausage gravy which made the meal really come together. So many flavors!! We didn't have a long wait at all either. - Yelper Mike M Yelp Fullscreen Domacin: www.yelp.com/biz/domacin-stillwater Photo: Seared scallop. Delicious and cooked perfectly. - Eric J More reader comments: From the food, to the wine pairings, to the quaint atmosphere, to the warm and engaging service, this place really excels. You definitely feel like you've left the cities and you're in a small ocean front town. - Yelper Jason R Yelp Fullscreen Lolo American Kitchen: www.yelp.com/biz/lolo-american-kitchen-stillwater Photo: Pork belly tacos, loved them. Fresh greens were fabulous as well. - Matt B More reader comments: At first glance, we were confused. United Nations-style tacos! Burgers! And Parmesan tater tots! What the hell are those all doing on the same menu? But holy bejezus, when you execute as well as these folks do you could be serving waffles and baba ganoush for all I care. Get DOWN with your bad self and just COOK for me. - Yelper Leah O Yelp Fullscreen Mai Ly Asian Cuisine: www.yelp.com/biz/mai-ly-asian-cuisine-stillwater-2 Photo: Roast pork and meatballs noodles soup with egg noodles. - Adele S More reader comments: Excellent pho and noodle salads. Everything we tried was wonderful. The owner/chef served us and is very personable. - Yelper Kristen W Yelp Fullscreen Sweet Taste of Italy: www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-taste-of-italy-stillwater Photo: Uploaded by business.

Kimberly F More reader comments: Great tour. Seriously! The tour was free and lasted maybe 1 hour and 15 minutes. Instead of the old boring talk of \"How does I make beer?\" , the tour guide Dave? talked about the history of beer, how it was used as payment, how it was used as a meal source, etc. It was awesome! As the tour went on (and I say less of a tour and more of a talk, since the space is just a walkway) we got to sample 4 of their beers. - Yelper Sarah M Yelp Fullscreen Maple Island Brewing: yelp.com/biz/maple-island-brewing-stillwater Photo: Beer flight. - Tetiana I More reader comments: Unlimited free popcorn, which I'm always a fan of, and the beer prices were extremely reasonable. $5 for a glass and $10 for a flight. My group all got flights and it was fun to try them all and the same time and talk about which ones we liked and why. - Yelper Erin D Yelp Fullscreen The Wedge & Wheel: www.yelp.com/biz/the-wedge-and-wheel-stillwater Photo: Amazing Cheese! - William R More reader comments: This is a friendly, local shop that features a small but thoughtfully curated selection of cheeses. Their real strength is finding domestic and really local cheeses that rival some of the great-grand-daddy cheeses from Europe. - Yelper Patti I Yelp Fullscreen Rose Mille: www.yelp.com/biz/rose-mille-stillwater Photo: In love with this pink couch. - Rodelle B More reader comments: They have stationery in the back with hundreds of ribbons, trimmings, and adornments to make all your packages as pretty as this shop. - Yelper Rodelle B Yelp Fullscreen Darn Knit Anyway: www.yelp.com/biz/darn-knit-anyway-stillwater Photo: Storefront. Love the name! - Lan F More reader comments: As far as selection, they have great brands and some that I haven't seen before but liked. They also carry a selection of fabric in the back so if you sew or want/need a lining or a border, there are some cute ones back there. - Yelper Breena E Yelp Fullscreen Ultima Bellezza Salon: www.yelp.com/biz/ultima-bellezza-salon-stillwater Photo - Amy L More reader comments: I cannot say enough good things about this salon. Such a wonderful environment with warm colors on the walls, comfy furniture, decorated so tastefully. Feels more like home than a salon. - Yelper Tina S Yelp Fullscreen Nelson's Drive In Dairy Store: www.yelp.com/biz/nelsons-drive-inn-dairy-store-stillwater-2 Photo: Single scoop of cookies & cream ice cream. - Jana H More reader comments: THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!
