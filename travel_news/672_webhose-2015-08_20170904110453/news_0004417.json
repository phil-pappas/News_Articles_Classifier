Sunday Oliseh, the new Nigeria manager, has made a personal plea to the 19-year-old. Oliseh travelled to Liverpool’s training ground, Melwood, on Wednesday to try to convince Ibe to change his allegiances from England. Ibe impressed the Anfield regulars last season It is an ambitious move by Oliseh, a former Juventus and Borussia Dortmund midfielder, given that Ibe is sure to attract the attention of England manager Roy Hodgson over the next few years. Ibe has represented England throughout his youth career, but Nigeria have made no secret of their wish to recruit him. The 2015-16 Premier League season starts in Speaking last season, Victor Ikpeba, a member of their technical and development committee, said: “The federation is looking at Jordon Ibe.

Ibe is regarded as a key player for Liverpool this season , with his development one of the main reasons his club were prepared to accept the £49  million bid for winger Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Ibe signed a new long-term deal at Anfield last season .
