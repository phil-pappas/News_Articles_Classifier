That is “something that very few adults and students in this area have experienced.” Kroeger, originally from Waseca, majored in psychology and minored in FACS at Minnesota State University-Mankato, and she also has a teaching license from the school in early childhood education. She then went on to achieve a master’s from the University of Northern Iowa before embarking on her overseas adventure in 2011. She realized teaching was her calling while she was in college, noticing she derived more enjoyment from teaching young children in a classroom setting than from her more frequent home visits with families. After applying to myriad spots around the globe, Abu Dhabi was the first to offer her a teaching gig, and she packed her bags. Kroeger taught in an American international school, which housed pre-school through 12th grade in the “Embassy” section of the city, where many of the students were children of a parent or parents who worked in embassies. There were five sections for each grade, and roughly 20 students per section. While English was the official language of the school, and all the teachers taught in English, the student body was far from a homogenous mixture, and only about one-third of Abu Dhabi’s population is comprised of native Emiratis, she said. There were students representing 77 different nationalities in the school, and she had students from 10 different countries in one of her classes--some of whom spoke no English at all. That can be a challenge for a teacher, but, at a first-grade level, Kroeger used actions--often overexaggerating them--and pictures to get her points across, she said. In addition, at that age, “they learn more from their peers as far as language.” She also coached volleyball and basketball there, which required an attitude adjustment on her part. Their varsity level is more equal to a junior varsity level here. Her sports lacked the emphasis they have in America, she said. There are no summer camps, they could only practice three days per week for one hour each day in-season, and there were no fans at games--parents just dropped off their children and left. Kroeger lived in staff housing while there with the rest of her school’s faculty, and said it’s a “very Westernized” city, with many of the comforts of home readily available, like a Domino’s right across the street from her apartment. “They do a good job of making sure you aren’t struggling, they don’t want you to leave.” Page 2 of 3 - Abu Dhabi is the capital and the second-most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (behind Dubai), and it’s been proclaimed the richest city in the world by CNN and Fortune magazine. The architecture is stunning, as is the city’s rapid ascent on the world stage. Kroeger describes it as “a late culture,” where activity doesn’t ramp up until 2 or 3 p.m., but it then goes until 2 or 3 a.m. It’s also a much less efficient place than America--back in the U.S. she could accomplish in only a couple hours a list of tasks that would’ve taken two days in Abu Dhabi. In addition to the enhanced efficiency and absence of a language barrier, she also prefers the “free water” in the U.S. “You take it for granted,” but in Abu Dhabi, tap water is not drinkable, and bottled water must always be purchased. And, since “it’s nice three months of the year and ungodly hot the rest of the time,” there is heavy air conditioning everywhere, meaning Kroeger often traveled with a sweater, even when the temperature outside was well over 100 degrees. Friday is considered the “religious day” there, as opposed to America, where that would be Sunday, so her work schedule was Sunday-Thursday, with Friday and Saturday off, she said. And, though the United Arab Emirates is technically a religious Muslim nation, strict adherence to the rules is not always observed. For example, while gambling is outlawed officially at the horse tracks--and the Emiratis love horse racing--there is often under-the-table betting, she said. Alcohol and pork are also prohibited, but there are opulent bars in hotels, liquor stores are hidden--but present--and there are pork sections nestled in darkness at the rear of stores. Driving is also different than in America, she said. There are roundabouts everywhere, but signs are mostly absent, and “rules are more like suggestions.” She didn’t have a street address, either, she said. Instead, directions are given and received based on six geographic landmarks. In addition, “every part of the city is known for something,” she said, so there’s a meat district with butcher shops, an area to procure kitchen or bathroom fixtures, a Christian section, and a restaurant district with international flair--everything from Lebanese to Asian to Ethiopian food. “I really liked the Ethiopian restaurant--you eat with your hands and that spongy bread.” She needed to familiarize herself with camels, as well. On a desert safari with fellow teachers and staff, one of a plethora of team-building staff outings she took part in, they engaged in dune crashing, sandboarding--like snowboarding, but on sand dunes--and, yes, riding camels, she said. Camels are hard to ride, because, at first, “you feel like you’re going to fall off,” and then it’s “bouncy and awkward.” Page 3 of 3 - Camels are also prevalent in food, she said. Milk from camels is often used--slightly sweeter than milk from cows--in things like cappuccino, and camel meat is prevalent, even on pizza, but it looks and tastes like beef. Kroeger was far from a world traveler before going to Abu Dhabi--she never had a passport--but she’s traveled to a plethora of international destinations since first going over to the United Arab Emirates, sampling “crunchy” grasshoppers and crickets in Thailand, spending a Christmas in Bethlehem and Jerusalem, touring the underground tunnels of Vietnam, and viewing the horror of concentration camps in Poland. “I’ve been very blessed with the things I was able to see and experience.” She’d return to Minnesota during her summers off to see her family and friends, but it was always heartbreaking to board the flights back to Abu Dhabi, she said. It was especially tough on her parents, although, after they visited her during her first Christmas away, they saw how safe and modern the city was and stopped fretting daily that she’d come to some gruesome end there. Kroeger moved back to Minnesota last winter; as much as she enjoyed her time in Abu Dhabi, unrest in the Middle East, especially the increasingly frequent and brutal attacks carried out by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), began to make her nervous. Seeing so many Westerners kidnapped by ISIS, and some beheaded, became “scary.” She spent three weeks subbing for eighth and ninth grade math, and then, after the winter break, she subbed for seven weeks teaching FACS, which she’ll now have full responsibility over. “Ashley served as a long-term sub in the position last year, so she is already familiar with our system, (and) there will be significantly less ‘new’ factor as compared to other staff we have hired previously,” Simon said. “She will already know most staff and many of the students.” She’ll teach classes on a variety of subjects, from basic food courses and child development, to creative design and textiles, sewing, and advanced baking, she said. “My main goal (teaching FACS) is to get them into a hobby [...] something they can continue, not just a project they do once and then throw away.” A former volleyball, basketball, and softball player herself, Kroeger is set to coach freshmen basketball and seventh-grade volleyball this year.
