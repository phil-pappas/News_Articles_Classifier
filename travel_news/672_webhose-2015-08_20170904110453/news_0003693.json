If you didn’t get the results you wanted, or are yet to nab a place, you may be reading this from behind a family-size bag of Maltesers and an impending sense of doom. Stop. Things may be rosier than you realise. A record 61,300 students used Clearing last year, many to bag a better university place. Rather than being the last-chance saloon for those desperate to get a degree, Clearing could be your shot at trading up to a better course. Here are seven reasons why: 1. It’s less of a gamble It makes sense to apply to university after you’ve got your results – for one, you get to cherry pick the places you already know you’re eligible for. There’s no guarantee you’ll get them, but the odds are stacked in your favour over applying blind. 2. You can get more for your dollar Clearing gives you a brief – if slightly manic – window to shop for a better buy. That doesn’t mean going for a cut-price course: it means knowing how your university choices affect your budget. Things you’ll want to check include any extra course fees or supplies you’ll need to stump up for, any scholarships and funding going, how much it’ll cost to get there (and get around), and what accommodation charges are like. Stick your figures into a money planner to see how things stack up.

Not everyone will make the cut It stands to reason that if you didn’t get the grades you were hoping for, thousands of other students didn’t either (or, for whatever reason, have since declined their place). That means a ton of reserved courses just opened up that you could be eligible for instead. 4. There’s more choice than you think Even ‘elite’ universities have Clearing spots going . Oxford, Cambridge and some of the Russell Group universities won’t play ball, but lots of other top flight courses will be available – you may even be able to ‘trade-up’ on your previous choices. Even if you miss your grades you can still find yourself in a lecture theatre in September 5. Universities need bums on seats Universities and colleges have spaces they need to fill, so may be more receptive to your results. It’s no loophole around entry requirements, but it does mean you now get to be more discerning: do they meet your minimum requirements? Think staff: student ratios, study facilities, graduate employment rates and anything else that’s a deal maker for you. 6. Your Ucas fee goes further You can apply for up to five courses through Ucas the first time round. There’s no limit on how many universities you can approach through Clearing. 7. You can refine your options If you’re having doubts that studying quantitative mechanics will be the giggle party everyone makes out, now’s the time to tweak your major. You may be able to pimp your other exam subjects to change track entirely. Need to know • There’s no stigma to getting into university through Clearing: it’ll make no difference to how you’re treated on your course later on. • Not all universities do Clearing. Don’t bank on waltzing into Oxbridge via the vacancy list. • The most popular courses will only consider students who already applied for them. While it may be possible to still get a place for medicine, for instance, you’ll need to already have jumped the interview and application hoops to get a look-in. • You’ll need to make fast choices to get the best places – but don’t think you have to take the first offer. Give yourself time to do your research and get a course and institution you’re happy with. • If you really lucked out on your grades, Clearing’s no magic wand. Whether you decide to re-sit, re-train or do something else entirely instead, talk to your school or college adviser about your options from here. • Clearing runs between July and September, with students with grades in-hand, or who get results earlier (International Baccalaureate, for one) able to apply earlier. That doesn’t mean all the good stuff is gone – most places will be filled in August, so get ready to make your move when the full listings open on August 12.
