Upon investigation: “They found a male juvenile salt water crocodile in a small cardboard canister inside one of his work boots.” \nBrisbane Magistrates’ Court heard that the man had purchased the crocodile lawfully and that it was so small as to be \"essentially harmless\". \nHowever, prosecutors argued that it was an offence to bring the reptile into Queensland without authorization. They said that although the crocodile was small at the time of the offence, a fully grown male salt water crocodile could reach five meters and weigh as much as 1000kg. \nThe man was fined $5,700 and ordered to pay $250 in costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T21:12:02.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
