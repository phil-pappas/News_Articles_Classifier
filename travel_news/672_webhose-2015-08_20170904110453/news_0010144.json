This order is the latest in Demers' ongoing expansion of sales. Phoenix Fire Department serves the sixth largest metropolitan area in the United State and maintains a fleet of more than 70 ambulances.\n\" Phoenix Fire Department faces a very demanding emergency medical response and transportation services environment. The department covers a large, downtown area, more than 516 square miles and a diversified population with ever-expanding needs,\" said Division Chief Scott Walker . \"We take a proactive approach to enhancing safety for our firefighters, EMTs and citizens. Demers was able to meet all of our design requirements and offer us the best structurally tested ambulance module in the industry, along with a host of safety and eco-friendly innovations that can make a real difference in our performance.\"\n\"We're very pleased and honored to have been selected to supply ambulances for one of the largest and busiest fire departments in the United States. Phoenix is known for its progressive approach on enhancing safety, performance and operating costs. They are a model of how leading fire departments handle emergency response,\" said Benoit Lafortune , executive vice president of Demers. \"At Demers, safety is always first and has driven our innovations and designs. These ambulances feature our two captain's chairs on the curbside instead of a traditional squad bench so the paramedic can provide patient care from a variety of positions while safely belted. They are also reflective of our stringent safety and testing guidelines which extend to a unique aluminum cabinet structure, along with equipment restraints and safety pull-testing that go above and beyond the current standards to help keep crews and patients safer.\"\nMXP150 Ambulances Designed for Phoenix F.D.\n\"This ambulance design was specifically engineered to meet the unique requirements of the Phoenix Fire Department based on collaborative discussions with department members and our engineering team. Together, we developed a customized solution that optimizes Phoenix's ability to respond and care for patients,\" said Lafortune.\nThe new Demers MXP150 ambulances will ride on Dodge 4500 4x2 diesel chassis and feature a 150-inch patient module to maximize payload and maneuverability. The interior cabinetry is constructed of aluminum. The module design was developed specifically to feature two seats on the curbside, one at the patient's head and one on the streetside to allow paramedics to position themselves wherever needed to optimize care for the patient. The design features a second work station on the curbside and a cabinetry configuration that maximizes storage.\nAward-Winning ECOSMART Anti-Idle System Provides Environmental Benefits and Operating Cost Savings\nThese new MXP 150 ambulances will be equipped with Demers' exclusive ECOSMART Anti-Idling System to provide Phoenix Fire Department with fuel savings and help lower operating costs over the life of the ambulances. While at idle, the ECOSMART System automatically shuts the chassis engine down when the module interior temperature and all voltage are at the correct levels. Once either the interior temperature or the unit's voltage moves outside the preset parameter, the system turns the engine back on automatically. The ecological and economic benefits of the system are many:\nReduced fuel consumption during idle time Fuel costs savings A noteworthy impact on the environment, with reductions of several tons of CO 2 emissions per year Reduced engine hours and increased time between service checks Longer life for the engine, chassis and ambulance The ambulances are also equipped with a severe-climate air conditioning system, including:\nDemers' exclusive Diffusion AIRFLOW System which generates heat below the medical cabinet at the bottom of the ambulance to flow upward, and the air conditioning system blowing from the ceiling to create a \"comfort blanket\" for the patient Individually ducted air conditioning vents to maximize air flow Separate multiplex-controlled air conditioning and heating systems for maximum efficiency and easier diagnostics and service 35,000 BTU auxiliary condenser / compressor combination Roof-mounted, 15,000 BTU RV-style air conditioning unit to maintain module temperatures while in station These new ambulances are scheduled to be delivered in February 2016 .\nRedSky Fire Apparatus of Phoenix, Arizona , is responsible for pre-delivery inspection, local service and support for the Phoenix Fire Department on this order.
