Americans of all ages continue to have strong feelings of support for Social Security, and the survey found several key themes. According to the national survey of adults, Social Security remains a core part of retirement security, and remains popular across generations and political ideologies. Americans want to live independently, but face challenges around saving for retirement that underscore the importance of Social Security for future generations of beneficiaries. \"As we celebrate Social Security on its 80th anniversary, our survey found that it remains as important as ever to American families,\" said Ryan Gruenenfelder , AARP Illinois Advocacy Manager. \"We also found that although most want to continue living independently as we age, obstacles to saving often continue to occur in our lives.

Specifically, 90% of adults under age 30 believe Social Security is an important government program, and 85% want to know it will be there when they retire. Americans have a desire not to depend on others because they: Want to live independently: 83% consider it extremely important to have the ability to live independently in their home for as long as they want, although 64% have concerns they won't be able to do so as they age. Additionally, while 68% feel it extremely important to have family around, 80% want to ensure self-sufficiency so their children and other relatives won't have to support them financially.
