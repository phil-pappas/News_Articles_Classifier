Who even knew Beijing had mountains? \nClearly not the IOC which awarded the bid based on a plan to build skiing and snowboarding venues at Yanqing,​ northwest of Beijing, destinations that boast a mere 5 to 21 centimetres of average snow depth. The rest will be provided by snowmaking – a lot of snowmaking. \nYanqing isn't the only unheard of ski and snowboard area yet to be discovered by our ski dollars. Greece, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Iran all offer ski and snowboard options if you're willing to put in the effort for more natural snow than Winter Olympics 2022 will offer. \nWe've compiled 10 you might want to put on your boasting bucket list. \nShymbulak, Kazakhstan – a mere half an hour's drive from the other bidder for 2022, Almaty. With eight lifts accessing a thousand metres of vertical with a top elevation of 3200 metres. But be quick, Prince Harry has already skied here so word is out. \nAlshan Ski Resort, China – thankfully Alshan has more snow than Yanqing and is the training base for the China ski team. Set in the prehistoric forests of Mongolia, you'll have to fly to Beijing, then to Ulanhot​ and catch a bus. \nParnassos Ski Resort, Greece – this is the largest ski resort in Greece, known more for tropical islands and melting economies than a ski mecca. Parnassos is made up of Kellaria, Fterolakka and Yerodovrahos​, all linked by 13 chairlifts and 23 ski runs. \nIran – take your pick from Tochal, Dizin, Shemshak and Darbandsar, the ski resorts of Tehran's mountain ranges. The chairlift lines are no longer gender segregated but while each resort offers a more relaxed leisure attitude to Tehran, be respectful of the principles of Islamic law when hitting the slopes. \nGulmarg, Kashmir – don't let the armed forces protecting the border deter you. Gulmarg has some seriously good skiing at very high altitude in the Himalaya. The resort is best described as \"rustic\" so take a guide. Mount Hotham's head of ski patrol Bill Barker takes group ski tours each year. Contact him at billstrips.com Ad Feedback \nThe world's highest skiing gondola, 4150 metres above sea level, can be found in Gulmarg, Kashmir.

Most resort skiing is tame in Iceland but if you're an advanced skier then heli skiing will get you to the steeper runs of Iceland. \nGreenland – Kiwi mountain guide Kevin Boekholt​ offers heli skiing trips to Greenland each May for intrepid skiers and boarders looking for a unique cultural experience and the opportunity to ski from mountain peak right down to the sea. Polar bear sightings are de rigueur. Contact Kevin at Greenland-heliskiing.com \nCerro Castor, Argentina – the southern most ski resort in the world sits a mere 195 metres above sea level but don't let that deter you – the resort offers snow skiing from June to October. Expect 10 lifts and 28 trails, 800 metres of vertical and 600 hectares of skiable terrain. \nMzaar, Lebanon – an hour's drive from Beirut, Mzaar is the largest ski resort in the Middle East. Founded in 1960, the area offers skiing from 1850 metres above sea level to 2465 metres. \nYongpyong, Korea – prepare to hear a lot about this Korean resort three hours from Seoul as it was awarded the 2018 Winter Olympics. There's still time to get in early to experience the 31 runs on the mainly intermediate mountain accessed by 15 lifts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:10:42.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
