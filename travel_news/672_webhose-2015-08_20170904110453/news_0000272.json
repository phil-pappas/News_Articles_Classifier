The airline cancelled four flights from Perth and Melbourne to Bali on Tuesday night. \nVirgin Australia has also delayed two flights from Australia to Bali. \nJetstar and Virgin Australia have warned that conditions are likely to deteriorate throughout the day. \nThe volcano has played havoc with flights since it began spewing corrosive, silica-based ash in early July, during the peak school holiday season. \nMount Raung is one of the most active volcanoes on the Indonesian island of Java, about 140 kilometres west of Bali. \nPassengers are advised to check the status of their scheduled flights online. \nStuff and Brisbane Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:05:17.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
