Do you want to get involved in a regular team activity but feel uninspired by all those “traditional” sports you’ve played before? It could be time to take up korfball… What is korfball? Put simply, it’s a fast-paced, dynamic cross between netball, basketball and handball. Two teams of eight compete to get the ball into a goal, or “korf”, which is basically a basket on a pole 3.5 metres above the ground. Although players are not allowed to run with the ball (as in netball), they can run without the ball – meaning that the action rarely lets up. The sport was invented in Holland in 1902 and, although it’s huge on the continent, it is played mostly in universities in this country… although that’s changing. Korfball is growing in popularity here: England are currently ranked fourth in the world, and Scotland and Wales are starting to make an impact at international level, too. What makes it different? Korfball is the only mixed-sex team ball sport in the world. Each team must field four female and four male players – and the fluid nature of the game, where defenders and attackers regularly “swap” positions, means that there is no advantage or disadvantage either way. It also means that goal scorers and defenders regularly exchange roles – so not only do players become adept in all positions, but there are no “stars” as in football or netball. Why should I do it? A good korfball team thrives on communication: winning tactics require fast movement and excellent teamwork, with every player getting involved. As a result, teams bond far more closely than in most sports - and that leads to a lively social element. “A friend introduced me to korfball almost three years ago and I’ve been playing ever since,” says Brad Kaye, who plays for Highbury Korfball Club in London. “It's fun, affordable and a great way to meet new people.” And then of course there are the physical benefits: Korfball not only gives you a cracking cardiovascular workout, but passing, shooting and dodging opponents will work most of your main muscle groups, as well as strengthening your core. Sounds great! How do I get involved? It couldn’t be easier. The sport is taking off all over Britain – and most local clubs are only too happy to welcome new members, regardless of ability or experience. You can download a list of all clubs from the English, Welsh or Scottish Korfball associations where they will not only teach you the subtleties of the game, but most should allow you a “taster” session for free – simply turn up in normal gym gear and trainers. Most clubs also have a lively social side, too, with a strong community away from the court – meaning that not only will you get fit learning a new sport, but you’ll make some great friends at the same time.
