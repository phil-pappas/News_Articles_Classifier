Aimed at radio enthusiasts, broadcast students and the digital community, the event takes place on 24 September at Patterns on Brighton Beach with a minimal registration fee of £5.00. \nRadio // Future Sounds features a day of conversation, music and live broadcast, exploring the rapidly changing landscape of radio and its potential as a core channel to communicate stories and narratives. A host of digital innovators and radio creators will investigate and celebrate radio’s role in our cultural future throughout the day. Nats Spada, digital and radio producer at totallyradio.com and event curator said: “There is so much exciting radio going on beyond the mainstream and we wanted to not only celebrate this, but also highlight the people making it happen. There will always be a need for trusted guides, curators and storytellers – the launch of Apple’s Beats 1 recognises this and shows that radio is very much here to stay”. Vicki Hughes, managing director at Fugu PR added: “With so many media and digital channels to select, our industry often misses the opportunities that radio offers. This event will provide an inspiring forum and offer the chance to shine a light on the potential of radio”. Radio // Future Sounds takes place at Patterns on 24 September, 10am-6pm.
