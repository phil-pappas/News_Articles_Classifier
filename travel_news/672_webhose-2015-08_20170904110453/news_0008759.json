The melon also has to be perfectly ripe. SERVES 6 INGREDIENTS • 250g caster sugar • 2 charentais melons • juice of 1½ lemons, or to taste METHOD Bring 250ml water up to the boil then pull it off the heat and add the sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved then set aside to cool. It’s important to capture every bit of juice from the melons so I usually cut them on a board set on a tray with a lip all the way round. Halve the melons and scoop out the seeds. Scoop the flesh out with a tablespoon into a bowl. Set a sieve over the bowl and put all the juice that’s collected in the tray and on the board into the sieve, along with the seeds and the fibres round them. Press the seeds lightly to extract more juice. Whizz the melon flesh and all the juice you’ve collected in a food processor. Push it through a sieve. Combine the purée with the sugar syrup and the juice of one of the lemons. Taste. You’ll probably need the juice of the other half lemon, but you don’t want to spoil the delicate taste of the melon so don’t go too far – add, stir and taste as you go. Put into a shallow container and place in the freezer. Fork through the mixture every so often to create icy shards. Serve just as it is, in little glasses.
