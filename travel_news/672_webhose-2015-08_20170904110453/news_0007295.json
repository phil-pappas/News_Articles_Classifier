The United States, which is sending 115 athletes, took home the most hardware at the first competition when it garnered 43 medals in all, including 28 gold medals.\nRepairs costing around $50,000 have been made to the track at the Chinese-built National Stadium in preparation for the event, according to the track and field federation.\n“For us it’s a true honor to be able to officially present the NACAC to the country,” Clarke said. “This is an achievement that shows we’re among the best countries in regards to organizing sporting events. It will also give a boost to track and field in our country by showing our athletes can compete with the continent’s best in the same place they train every week.”", "external_links": ["http://www.iaaf.org/home", "http://www.icoder.go.cr/"], "published": "2015-07-31T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:35:11.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
