His official start date is 1 September, 2015.\nMr. Yuthasak, 49, was appointed by the TAT Board of Directors as the TAT Governor after Mr. Thawatchai Arunyik who completed his term at the end of March 2015. He was previously the executive vice president and chief financial officer of Thailand’s MCOT Public Company Limited (MCOT).\nCommenting on his appointment, Mr. Yuthasak said, “I’m very honoured to have been selected to this very important post. Thailand has excellent tourism products and services and that TAT itself is staffed by capable people who have done a great job in helping to make tourism one of the main pillars of Thailand’s economy.”\nMr. Yuthasak said he planned to introduce three immediate strategies upon taking the Governor post at the TAT, including reassuring global confidence and stimulating domestic tourism in the wake of the recent tragic incident in Bangkok, as well as creating a better TAT.\nOn reassuring global confidence, TAT’s domestic and overseas offices are providing regular updates on the ‘business as usual’ situation in Thailand and reiterating that the country continues to be a welcoming tourist destination. In December, TAT will organise a major event to draw tourists.\nPromoting domestic tourism will also be a top priority, he said, especially for students and senior citizens. He said new ways would be found to promote domestic travel not just during school holiday periods and weekends but during weekdays, all-year.\nOn creating a better TAT, Mr. Yuthasak said, “I plan to further strengthen the confidence among the people within and outside the organisation and to build on the existing ‘TAT SPIRITS’ concept to promote good governance and transparency as well as to reinforce TAT’s positioning as the ‘Guardian of Thai Tourism’ to extend its expertise to other organisations.”\nHe added the plans were to build on the TAT’s strong foundation to improve cooperation with other government agencies, the private sector and partners abroad, and to streamline internal procedures to upgrade the operational efficiency of the TAT, a state enterprise.\nSource:- Tourism Authority of Thailand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:08:39.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
