At UPAF, Fantle will work with staff, member organizations and community stakeholders to further elevate the profile of the region’s performing arts and its significant economic and quality of life impact and the role the arts play in attracting and retaining workforce talent. UPAF is a united arts fund that raises operating funds for 15 member performing arts groups and numerous affiliate organizations. In 2015, UPAF's annual campaign raised more than $12 million. Fantle most recently served as executive director of the Milwaukee chapter for the National Association of the Remodeling Industry. Before that he spent 10 years in the hospitality and tourism industry as deputy secretary of tourism and vice president of public relations for Visit Milwaukee. UPAF president and CEO Deanna Tillisch said Fantle leads marketing at a key time when the organization needs to grow its annual campaign, which is already at record numbers. “One key requirement for growth is to increase awareness of and engagement in the performing arts,\" Tillisch said. \"Dave’s background and expertise in all facets of marketing are ideal for achieving that strategic objective.\" While at the Wisconsin Department of Tourism , Fantle led marketing efforts that featured a series of seven TV commercials directed and conceived by filmmakers and Milwaukee-area natives David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams . The ads included takeoffs of the trio's comedy \"Airplane!\" and a commercial featuring members of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra engaging in a snowball fight on stage. Other spots starred Green Bay Packers receiver Jordy Nelson and Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball coach Bo Ryan. The ads sparked a flurry of media and social media attention after Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton dismissed the \"Airplane!\" spots as \"idiotic.\" Wisconsin tourism officials responded saying that they were pleased with the extra attention Dayton's comment attracted. Fantle is also known for being the brainchild behind the so-called \"Bronze Fonz\" statue in downtown Milwaukee. He conceived of the statue of Henry Winkler's iconic character from the \"Happy Days\" sitcom, set in Milwaukee, while he was leading public relations at Visit Milwaukee, the city's visitor and convention bureau. \nWant Milwaukee Media & Marketing news in your inbox?
