Economists believe currency weakness will trigger another devaluation in coming months.\nThe new Private Investment Law was passed by Angola’s parliament on August 11 but details were previously not made public.\n\"A significant part of private investment has become a major drain, with foreign currency going abroad,\" governor Jose Pedro de Morais told reporters late on Monday. \"This new law will correct this.\"\nMr de Morais earlier on Monday told state television that companies operating in Angola and citizens should reduce their \"foreign currency needs\" by 50%. It was not clear if this was part of the new investment law.\nThe new law would require foreign companies to run operations from an Angolan bank, Mr de Morais said, a measure experts believe is aimed at monitoring firms that regularly report losses, meaning they do not have to pay taxes.\nInvestors in \"strategic sectors\", including telecoms, electricity, construction, water, technology and transportation, will need to give a local partner at least a 35% share in the business, the legislation also states.\nForeign oil majors, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, Total and Eni, all have large operations in Angola. Portugal, once the colonial ruler in Angola, also plays a major role in the economy.\nStandard & Poor’s lowered its credit outlook on Angola to negative last week, indicating it may cut its credit rating on sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest economy if things do not improve.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:01:10.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
