(Susan Stocker / Sun Sentinel) No official opening date yet for new Margaritaville Hollywood Beach Resort \nThe new Margaritaville Hollywood Beach Resort has a deal for you: $197.70 per night. \nIt might seem like a lot, but consider that rooms were starting at $259 a night when the soon-to-open resort started to take reservations in May. \nPlus, you get two free margaritas. \nMargaritaville calls the promotion \"Throwback to Paradise,\" paying homage to Jimmy Buffett's 1977 hit \"Margaritaville.\" WOW... local phone calls! Really? You mean I can call any local number as much as I want for FREE???? OMG, I gotta book this now! ridemadone 2 \nThe rate is good for stays in certain rooms between Oct. 1 and Dec. 15. The resort's website shows the $197.70 rate for a room with a king bed and a view of the Intracoastal Waterway. A view of the ocean goes for $239. \nYou'll also pay a $15 daily resort fee, which covers free Wi-Fi, use of the fitness center, two beach chairs and umbrella, bottled water, in-room coffee and local phone calls. \n\"We hope that their first experience leads to a lifetime of future visits,\" said Cate Farmer, the resort's general manager. \nThe 17-story Margaritaville is nearing completion on five acres at Johnson Street and State Road A1A along the Hollywood Beach Broadwalk. The resort has not announced what day it will open, but the earliest reservation available is Oct. 1. \nIn April, the hotel's developer, Lon Tabatchnick, told city commissioners that Margaritaville could open after mid-July and before Labor Day, if all goes as planned. \nThe resort includes 151 king rooms, 154 queen rooms and 44 suites, along with the Jimmy Buffett Suite and the Coral Reefer Suite, which will occupy the penthouse level. \nThe multimillion-dollar hotel will offer eight restaurants and bars, oceanside pools, a FlowRider wave ride, a spa and fitness center and 30,000 square feet of convention space. \nA hotel spokeswoman said Thursday that the resort's restaurants and bars will be open to the public, but its pool and other amenities will be for registered guests only. The resort has not decided whether pool or resort passes will be sold to the non-hotel customers. \nMargaritaville will have a hiring fair from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday to fill several Guest Services positions, including concierge, bell captain, room attendant, reservations agent and greeter. \nThe job fair is scheduled for its pre-opening offices at 1909 Tyler Street in Hollywood. \nFor a list of open positions, go to margaritavilleresorts.com/careers/hiring-event . \nasatchell@sunsentinel.com , 954-356-4209 or Twitter@TheSatchreport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:19:32.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
