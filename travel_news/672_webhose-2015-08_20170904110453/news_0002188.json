The blistering heat wave, which, according to meteorologists, peaked today (Aug 3), sent temperatures to 41 degrees Celsius in Amman, the highest since 2010, and since the beginning of this summer.\nThe southern regions, the desert and the Jordan Valley, sweltered in massive heat today, with the high reaching 45 degrees Celsius in the Red Sea port city of Aqaba. Late afternoon, a sandstorm swept across the Kingdom, forcing airport authorities to reschedule some flights and divert 3 inbound aircraft.\nThe Queen Alia Airport authorities, called on travellers to check their flights schedule, before heading to the airport, in order to remain updated for any possible changes.\nPolice urged motorists, especially those travelling on the desert highway, to exercise extreme caution, by leaving a safe distance with other vehicles and avoid speeding.\nThe massive dust completely obscured visibility in some desert areas. The Jordan Meteorological Department said, there is a chance for here-and-there intermittent thunderstorms, but no major rainfall is forecast anywhere.\nSo far, no weather-related accidents have been reported, as people continue to abide by advice aired by authorities, prior to the exceptional weather conditions. Electric power load is expected to reach 3,000 megawatts tomorrow, while the Kingdomâ€™s generation capacity is 4,000 megawatts.\nThe heatwave is forecast to slightly subside over the next few days, but temperature will remain in the 37-39 degrees Celsius vicinity.\nIn other countries of the Middle East, there were reports that temperatures hit a massive record high of 72 degrees Celsius in some parts of Iran.\nIraq has already declared a four-day mandatory vacation, as mercury levels broke the 50 degrees Celsius barrier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:29:57.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
