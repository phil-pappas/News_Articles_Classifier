The unions should call off their strike action and allow London to continue to welcome visitors with open arms. “According to latest figures online searches for hotels and accommodation in London fell by almost a quarter during the last Tube Strike action and we expect this to be the case again. We hope that trade union leaders will be able to avoid further strike action in the future so our members can continue to welcome guests uninterrupted and to protect London’s place as the top destination in the world.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:19:00.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
