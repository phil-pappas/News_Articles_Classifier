In September of 2014, the Board of Directors of the Marina del Rey, Calif.-based consortium made the decision to require all Signature members to join ASTA, noting that the association brings a sense of security to its network of over 6,000 travel professionals.\nASTA President and CEO Zane Kerby said, “ASTA is the only organization with the industry expertise and relationships with policymakers and coalitions that are vital to protect the best interests of the travel agency community. We thank the Signature board for placing their faith in us to continue this work.”\nSignature President and CEO Alex Sharpe believes ASTA’s advocacy role is a critical “insurance policy” – and is one of the main reasons Signature’s Board of Directors decided to mandate membership, saying, “We are committed to a long-term partnership with ASTA as we simply won’t survive in this business without the work that ASTA does on our behalf.”\nSignature travel consultants also are benefitting from a bulk deal signed with ASTA that provides access to the Agent Regulatory Compliance Course designed to educate frontline consultants on complex federal regulations, thus avoiding costly fines. “Alex and the Signature Board of Directors understand what ASTA brings to the table,” said Kerby. “It is through the support of our members, especially our consortia members, that we can continue to offer these critical resources to travel consultants.”\nThis is the second agreement ASTA has signed with a consortium this year. ASTA leverages its unique strength as an association before the U.S. Congress, the White House, federal agencies and all 50 state legislatures in the fight to keep the retail distribution channel strong and thriving for years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:11:55.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
