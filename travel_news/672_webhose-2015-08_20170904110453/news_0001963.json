Wheelchair participants can now add EdgeWalk to their bucket list as the World's Highest Outdoor Walk on a Building has introduced accessible wheelchair EdgeWalks. \n\"Since the CN Tower first presented the thrilling EdgeWalk, we've been working on enhancing the accessibility of this unique experience,\" said Neil Jones, acting Chief Operating Officer of the CN Tower. \"As the official attraction for the TORONTO 2015 Pan / Parapan Am Games we are pleased to welcome Rick Hansen along with Alexa Komarnycky and Carla Qualtrough, to help us launch the accessible wheelchair EdgeWalk experience on the historic opening day of the TORONTO 2015 Parapan Am Games. \" \n\"As an iconic Canadian landmark, it's great to see the CN Tower use their partnership with the TORONTO 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am Games as an opportunity to work towards creating a world without barriers\" said Rick Hansen, Paralympian and chief executive officer of the Rick Hansen Foundation. \"Creating a thrilling experience like the EdgeWalk, making it accessible to people with visual impairments and now launching the accessible wheelchair EdgeWalk, demonstrates the great steps being taken for people of all abilities to show that anything is possible.\" \n\"The CN Tower is one of Toronto's most iconic symbols and a world leader in delivering unique experiences,\" said Sa√§d Rafi, TO2015's chief executive officer. \"The Tower has been a tremendous supporter of the Games, and the launch of the accessible wheelchair EdgeWalk not only aligns with TO2015's values of inclusion and accessibility, but allows even more people to live life on the edge. We hope everyone will get into the Parapan Am spirit, get out and enjoy the Games and try out the EdgeWalk!\" \nUsing a uniquely designed one piece wheelchair with its own attachment to the EdgeWalk's overhead rail and trolley system and a walksuit adapted for ease of dressing, participants who meet the parameters outlined on the EdgeWalk website (edgewalkcntower.ca) now have the opportunity to experience the thrill of an accessible wheelchair EdgeWalk. Given the unique nature of EdgeWalk, participants must meet the existing EdgeWalk participation criteria, must be able to wear the EdgeWalk harness and must be able to independently transfer from personal wheelchair to EdgeWalk wheelchair as well as independently maneuver the wheelchair throughout the experience. \nEdgeWalk at the CN Tower \nEdgeWalk is the world's highest hands-free walk on a building (Guinness World Record) on a 5 ft (1.5 m) wide ledge encircling the top of the CN Tower's main pod, 356m, (1168 ft, 116 stories) above the ground. This \"bucket list\" adrenalin-fueled experience allows thrillseekers to walk the edge of one of the world's greatest man-made wonders. Adventure lovers walk \"hands-free\" in groups of six, while attached to an overhead safety rail via a trolley and harness system. Tickets cost $195 CAD and include a keepsake video, photos and certificate of achievement. Participants also receive a General Admission CN Tower Experience Ticket with SkyPod.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T22:42:04.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
