Vistara turned an ordinary, mundane day of mine into a memorable one and the entire crew made me feel like a celebrity. From the warm reception at the airport, I was pampered throughout the journey to my destination, Goa. I definitely look forward to flying with Vistara again.”\nTo mark this special milestone and as a token of appreciation, Vistara is also offering a complimentary Premium Economy Class ticket to its Business Class customers, travelling from 12th August to 30th September 2015.
