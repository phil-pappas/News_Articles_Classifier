The Government of The Bahamas Managing Agency (NEMA) has given an “All Clear,” for all operations to return to normal. The Tropical Storm minimally impacted The Islands Of The Bahamas as hotels and cruise ship ports remained open. The airports have also remained opened and are operating as usual. Hotels, resorts, restaurants and entertainment venues are all open and welcoming guests. \nThe remnants of Tropical Storm Erika is moving towards the West-Northwest and heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches across Central Southeast Bahamas through Sunday. Those with travel plans on Bahamasair today, August 29, are advised to check in directly with them, as flights were pre-emptively cancelled for Tropical Storm Erika. Bahamasair flight 326 from Freeport to Nassau will depart at 5pm. Bahamasair operations will return to normal tomorrow, Sunday, 30th of August. \nWith minimal impact it is a quick return to business for hotels and cruise ships across The Islands Of The Bahamas, where visitors and residents alike can continue to enjoy their time n The Bahamas.. \n“We are incredibly thankful that the storm changed course and is no longer a threat to The Bahamas, and will hopefully not be a threat for future countries having dissipated into a trough of low pressure. In anticipation of the Tropical Storm, The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism was vigilant so as to ensure that visitors and residents remained safe by having our partners, businesses and residents enacting our well-rehearsed tropical storm plans in place. Thankfully, we were minimally impacted by Erika, but some of our neighbors were not so lucky. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dominica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\" said Joy Jibrilu, Director General for The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. \nAbout The Islands of The Bahamas The Islands of The Bahamas have a place in the sun for everyone from Nassau and Paradise Island to Grand Bahama to The Abaco Islands, The Exuma Islands, Harbour Island, Long Island and others.
