But it's nice sometimes to have photographs of oneself, perhaps with partner or friends, when on holiday and nowadays it can be a bit risky asking a stranger to take your camera and take a photograph of you! This is an amazingly clear and sharp photograph considering that you took it at such a long exposure as 1/20 second on 200mm - you must either have a very, very steady hand or your lens has stabilisation - or perhaps you were just lucky. In any case, it's worked out very well with the two girls very clear and sharp against a nicely out of focus background. Excellent!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:21:17.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
