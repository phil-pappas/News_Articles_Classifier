Today’s airlines are not only servicing higher volumes of passengers but are also held to the high service standards of the digital age. Contemporary travelers demand accurate information on-command as well as the ability to make changes and requests in real-time. \nAccording to analysts at Juniper Research, one-third of all boarding passes will be issued on mobile devices by 2019, quickly making planning ahead, self-service and selective buying the new airline industry normal. \n“Early planners will prevail in this new era of travel, and procrastinators will pay in both time and money,” said Dr. Christoph Wollersheim, a senior aviation economist for Booz Allen. “The focus must now shift to how the travel industry can service record demand while recapturing the hearts of the traveling public by redefining customer service.” \nIn light of the growing trend toward consumer self-reliance, the firm has observed tourism organizations increasingly using analytics to deliver more personalized customer service – mirroring trends seen in the retail sector. \n“These innovators will soar above the competition in the next 12-18 months,” Cosmas said. “And we’re committed to helping them turn customers’ digital breadcrumbs into actionable insights that allow them to better predict – and explain – the choices those customers make.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:40:23.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
