On weekends, Chambers also serves a Southern-themed brunch.\nAtta Boy Southern 1407 14th Ave., Seattle\nHours: 5 p.m.-12:30 a.m. daily and brunch on weekends from noon-3 p.m.\nEtc: Credit cards accepted; full cocktail service at Bar Sue; stairway to entrance, not wheelchair accessible; parking on street. Takeout orders can be made by calling Bar Sue 206-328-0888\nPrices: $\nThe menu: The daily menu features three to four sandwich options ($8-$9), though it’s really a menu of one: the porchetta is what everyone orders. Other standbys are the fried chicken and, for vegetarians, fried green tomatoes, each served on a Macrina ciabatta. Side options are fries, waffle tots or braised greens ($5 each). Brunch features five entrees ($11-$12) including Kentucky hot brown.\nMost Read Stories Chelan blazes: With no end in sight, thousands evacuate Percy Harvin doubles down on comments about his Seahawks tenure Reactions mixed to NYT story about Amazon’s work conditions Jeff Bezos says Amazon won’t tolerate ‘callous’ management practices Inside Amazon: wrestling big ideas in a bruising workplace What to write home about: The specialty, the porchetta ($9), with piles of pork belly slices topped with an tangy medley of fennel slaw, pickled onion and an aioli to balance the fat-dripping bite. A recent board special was an overstuffed po’boy ($10) with cornmeal-coated fried shrimp atop a bed of spiced tomato jam. For brunch, try the cheddar polenta topped with prawns and a poached egg.\nThe setting: Atta Boy is located inside a bar, though those under 21 can order from the window and eat in the dining area before 9 p.m. Order from the roadhouse-like window, then take a number. The bar can be loud, with music that seemed cribbed from an MTV 1980 playlist with Public Enemy and Ratt.\nSumming up: Three sandwiches, porchetta, fried chicken and a po’boy with a side of waffle tots, enough to feed three, totaled $36.17.\nTan Vinh: tvinh@seattletimes.com .
