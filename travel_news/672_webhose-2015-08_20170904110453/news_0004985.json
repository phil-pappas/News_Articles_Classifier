Once they reach the top, it's all about focus.\n\"You kind of want to clear your mind when you're going down the run so you can just let your muscle memory take over,\" Ledger said.\nAt only 15 years of age, Ledger is already jumping long distances, striving for big goals.\n\"I'm aiming to compete on the Fiske Cup level, which is the lowest level of international competition,\" Ledger said.\nTara Geraghty Moats has a few years on Beckett. She's 22 and has been into Nordic jumping for a dozen years.\n\"It's a real thrill!\" she said.\nAll of that experience is paying off.\n\"I went to World Championships last year and came in 18th. So the Olympics are definitely a realistic goal,\" Geraghty Moats said.\nNordic jumpers like Geraghty Moats and Ledger catch about 12 feet of air when launching off the jump at speeds of nearly 60 mph. A good jump, which typically includes a head wind for added lift, will take jumpers 90 meters or more.\n\"It's really similar to the feeling of putting your hand out a car going about 60 mph; there's a pillow of air sitting underneath your hand; only it sits underneath our whole bodies and helps us go down the hill,\" Geraghty Moats explained.\nSo how does this jump work without snow? When the ski jumpers are initially going down, they're in a porcelain track with marble cutouts, so it feels like they're going on snow. Once they land, they hit plastic, which is kept wet by the coaches so they can ride to the base easily. For Ledger, the track feels just like snow.\nSummer practice makes a difference.\n\"Summer is really the best place to make gains. Because in the winter months we have a really tight competition schedule,\" Ledger said.\nThese jumps are a sight that can't be missed. Spectators are welcome. Chelsea, 8, from Toronto, was impressed.\n\"It was cool because he came down really fast; and then slid on the grass,\" she said.\nDespite the rave review, Chelsea has no plans to get into the sport.\nOthers watching the jumps have an appreciation for them.\n\"I'm just glad to see that the U.S. is training our young people, so we can compete, because when I was growing up the U.S. didn't compete and it's changed a lot because of the facilities here,\" said Robert Ellis of Pennsylvania.\nGeraghty Moats really likes having spectators around. For her, crowds add a competitive feel. The energy, the crowds, the jumps: It's all part of the experience.\n\"I certainly wouldn't be where I am as an athlete without these facilities,\" Geraghty Moats said.\nAn experience that helps athletes go the distance.\nThe Nordic jumping is part of the summer jumping series going on in Lake Placid. Every Wednesday and Saturday visitors can watch Nordic and freestyle jumpers honing their skills.
