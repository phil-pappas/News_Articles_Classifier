Vail Resorts Inc. (NYSE: MTN) will invest more than $110 million into resort improvements for the upcoming ski season — a mix of previously announced projects like the creation of a giant resort in Utah , as well as newly revealed plans for Colorado areas. The Broomfield-based company will spend $50 million linking its Park City and Canyons Resort areas in Utah, creating the largest ski resort in the United States with more than 7,300 acres of skiing terrain, CEO Rob Katz said on Tuesday. But that will encompass less than half of the company’s overall spending on its six Rocky Mountain area properties. “The overall capital plan reflects our goal to target high-return investments which support a premium experience, and our improvement plan in Utah will be one of the most transformative ever undertaken in the ski industry,” Katz said. In addition to that effort, the company said in a release that it will: Upgrade the Avanti Express chairlift at Vail Mountain into a six-passenger, high-speed lift; Add new snow-making capacity to the Peak 6 area of Breckenridge Ski Resort; Expand its snow-making system at Beaver Creek Resort; Renovate rooms and common areas at the Keystone Lodge and Spa; and Roll out new technology for its EpicMix app that allows skiers to see wait times at resort chairlifts. \nGet Denver  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T03:17:48.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
