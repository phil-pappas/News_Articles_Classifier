You can join tour groups to marvel at history and take photos of cathedrals, or alternatively, take selfies with hashtags to be uploaded to Instagram. \nOr, you can go beyond, meet the real people and truly experience a place in a true and immersive way. I did this through volunteering and helping build an ecological centre in the south of Spain. By excusing myself from the tourist track, I saw a part of Spain that you wouldn't read about in Lonely Planet or hear about on walking tours. Volunteering 'uncomfortable yet beautiful' Share your stories, photos and videos. \nMy plan was to travel Europe for three months, with nothing but my small red backpack. After a whirlwind trip around Italy and Ireland I found myself in Portugal. \nWhile on a walking tour in Porto I realised I was simply a spectator in the city, looking at it like I would a gallery, skimming the surface rather than throwing myself into it. I looked at the old women sitting outside their homes and gossiping. I watched the neighbourhood kids play football among the cobblestone ground. Members of the group would take their cameras out to photograph these people, but all I could think of was \"I'm looking at these people as if they're not like me at all. I want to meet them, not just watch them\". \nThe next day, while on the seven-hour bus ride to Spain, I decidednot to be a tourist any longer. I would meet the real people of Spain, I just had to figure out how. I arrived in beautiful and picturesque Seville, and after walking around my new neighbourhood, I jumped online to check out workaway.com. \nA sunny day in the Andalusian capital of Seville.

It's an exchange of work in return for free accommodation and food. It didn't take me long before I found Markus and Ute, a German couple who lived on a five-hectare piece of land in Riogordo, near Malaga. They needed help building their own ecological centre in their backyard. I was interested, despite the fact that I had no construction skills and limited gardening experience. I applied, and was accepted within ten minutes. \nThe next day I caught two buses to Riogordo – receiving free Spanish lessons along the wayfrom an elderly lady who spoke no English. Ad Feedback \nUte picked me up in the afternoon and told me her story. She came to Spain 20 years ago with her son, who was then a toddler. She had only enough money to buy a caravan, in which she and her son lived for a year and a half until she found the one-bedroom cottage in Riogordo. Since then she has worked constantly to build on the property. What was once a single bedroom, one storey cottage is now a three bedroom and two storey house with a terrace. \nMarkus came on board four and a half years ago. He left his job as a mediator in Stuttgart, Germany, to join Ute here for a simpler and quieter way of life. When he arrived, Ute was serious about doing the place up and selling it. But Markus convinced her not to, and they decided to build their own ecological centre. \nThe house is surrounded by beautiful plants, blooming flowers, and vegetables sprouting everywhere. The plan is to also build a new swimming pool, three extra bedrooms, add another plant nursery, and add a small room for Markus to use as an office. \nThe author's accommodation in Riogordo.

T spent the morning chopping trees. The Spanish men helped with the ongoing construction on the house. I looked after the garden and plant nursery. With my clippers and spade I spent all morning pruning and watering, chopping up old discarded plants, and pulling vegetables – mainly potatoes, tomatoes and onions. \nBy midday, the temperatures were already high – verging on about 30 degrees. I worked for another hour or two, and then retired inside for Siesta, because by then temperatures were dancing around 36 degrees. \nI slept, read, and T taught me guitar. We gathered for lunch and the Spanish men would laugh about how burnt I got in the afternoon, and despite Siesta, I would still sweat enough to fill a swimming pool. \nWe would make halfhearted attempts to go back to work but usually the heat was still scorning us, and we'd retire back inside. \nThe author's view of Riogordo. Photo: Sophia Duckor-Jones \nI helped prepare dinner, which usually consisted of peeling the potatoes I pulled in the morning and chopping the tomatoes. After dinner we stuck to Spanish tradition and stayed up late. We talked, we laughed, and we sang late into the night. \nOn Tuesdays T and I would drive into town to try and sell some of the tomatoes I picked. We were always successful. \nThis became my life and I loved it. It was quiet, simple and beautiful. \nNot another soul in sight for miles, just me, in the garden, experiencing Spain not through a tourists eyes, but as a traveller with the earth under my fingernails. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:05:16.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
