As of today, Amadeus subscribers will be able to book Lufthansa’s and Austrian’s new Light, Classic and Flex fares for flights departing as of 1 October. \nIn a bid to increase multichannel merchandising opportunities and maximise exposure to travellers, the end-to-end solution makes LHG’s branded fares available through all Amadeus retailing interfaces, across worldwide points of sale, and for all customer segments. Amadeus Fare Families enables the integrated deployment of LHG’s new fare structure to provide a consistent offer to both intermediaries and travellers. By branding and differentiating products and services, LHG airlines will be able to show the full value of each fare family, offering greater transparency on product characteristics and terms and conditions. Through this enhanced shopping experience, Travel Agents will be able to better service and advise their customers throughout the booking flow, as well as upsell from one fare family to the next based on individual needs and preferences. Travellers will benefit from increased transparency, greater travel customisation through the channel of their choice and the ability to only pay for the services they will use. “We are pleased to make our new fare concept for European flights available in both the direct and indirect channels so LHG customers and Amadeus Travel Agents can enjoy a consistent offer and shopping experience across the LH Group airlines. Our Fare Families and Ancillary Services strategies complement each other to offer travellers greater choice, innovation and freedom to customise their travelexperience with us according to personal preferences” Joerg Hennemann, Senior Vice President Automated Sales, Pricing & Distribution of Lufthansa German Airlines said. Holger Taubmann, Senior Vice President Distribution, Amadeus adds: \"We are happy to support Lufthansa’s and Austrian’s multi-channel merchandising strategy. Through Amadeus Fare Families, airlines can reshape the way they package, display and upsell their brandedfares to travel agents and consumers, while Amadeus Ancillary Services enables airlines to offer travellers additional customised travel services. With deep end-to-end integration across all Amadeus retailing interfaces and worldwide points of sale, the solutions embody the leading role that our technology plays in the travel industry and our commitment to innovation”. Lufthansa and Austrian join SWISS and Brussels Airlines as the first airlines to go live with ATPCo Branded Fares. Amadeus is the first technology provider to support this new industry standard, offering airlines the ability to file centrally or directly in the Amadeus system.
