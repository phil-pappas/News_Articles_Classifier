(Ferrari World Abu Dhabi)\nAn Indian taxi driver based in Abu Dhabi had the ride of his life thanks to a generous passenger.\nLiam Murphy, an engineer from Cork, Ireland, was visiting the United Arab Emirates for business when he decided to spend a day at the Ferrari World theme park.\nDuring the two hour drive from Dubai, Murphy began speaking with his Indian-born driver, Shakiha, and learned that he had never been able to afford to go inside the park despite having lived abroad for 14 years, reports Metro UK . Instead, he usually waited outside for a few hours until his passengers returned.\nInstead of letting Shakiha wait outside, Murphy decided to treat his driver to day at the park, shelling out $95 for a ticket.\nPosted by Liam Murphy on Sunday, August 16, 2015 “Today I made his dreams come true for the laugh,” Murphy posted on Facebook. “His first ever roller coaster ride was on the fastest in the world.”\nIn addition to being the world's largest indoor theme park, Ferrari World is home to several high-speed attractions including the world’s fastest roller coaster Formula Rossa . Cars reach speeds up to nearly 150 miles per hour—not an easy ride for a first time roller coaster experience.The pair also rode on the Fiorano GT Challenge, with cars that look just like a Ferrari F430 Spider.\nPosted by Liam Murphy on Sunday, August 16, 2015 Though Shakiha reportedly had a great time at the park, Murphy posted that his driver did say “I do not feel well sir,” after experiencing the hairpin turns and record-breaking speed of the park coasters.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/liammurf/posts/1184622561564902?pnref=story", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1184622431564915&set=a.424013450959154.118782.100000515081494&type=1", "http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/18/this-awesome-guy-took-his-taxi-driver-to-a-theme-park-5348008/", "https://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/en-gb/attractions/formula-rossa.aspx", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1184622538231571&set=a.424013450959154.118782.100000515081494&type=1"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:31:57.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
