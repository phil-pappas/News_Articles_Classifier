Doug and Sandi have been taking care of Jabu, Thembi and Morula for over 25 years. They live in the heart of Botswana's Okavango Delta close to two safari camps - Sanctuary Baines and Sanctuary Stanley . The \"walking with elephants\" experience described below is only possible if you stay at either one of these camps, and is an additional (but well worth it) cost. Ask your agent to book you a spot in advance as numbers are limited. Anouk Zijlma 1. Meeting the Elephants \nYou meet the elephants along with Doug and Sandi Groves in a scenic spot in the northern Okavango bush. An armed guide accompanies you incase you run into some wildlife while walking and interacting with the elephants. Doug and Sandi introduce the elephants and give you their (very sad) history. All three elephants were orphaned as a result of culling operations in Zimbabwe and South Africa . You have lots of opportunity for photos and to ask questions. Anouk Zijlma 2. Walking with Elephants \nAfter the introductions and learning about the individual elephants, you get to walk with them while they forage for food, erin manx enjoy a mud or dust bath. The walk usually lasts around 40 minutes, it's a wonderful way to get a taste of what a walking safari is like and an awesome feeling to get to experience the bush as the elephants do. Doug and Sandi show you how elephants sleep, smell, and use their trunks to choose the tastiest piece of bark or vegetation. Our walk was cut short because a young wild bull came to check out the orphans, and Morula decided to follow him deeper into the bush. We stood a safe distance away as Doug made sure Morula came back safe and sound. Doug and Sandi have to contend with curious wild elephants, buffalo and lion on a weekly basis as they accompany the elephants on their daily outings. Anouk Zijlma 3. Learning About Elephants \nElephants rarely lie down to sleep, they tend to spend most of their day eating, so it's wonderful to be able to see how they do sleep, as Doug and Sandi have trained their orphans to lie down on command! This is just one small example of how much you learn about elephant behavior on this half day outing. We also got to look right into an elephants mouth, see it's tongue and back teeth at close range. We got to hear their various means of communicating, from whistles to rumbles. It's the only time I have heard an elephant trumpet without being scared out of my wits! We watched them eat their favorite foods in season in the bush around them, and peered closely at the craggy soles of their feet. Anouk Zijlma 4. Getting Close to Elephants \nYou haven't lived until you've experienced the sweet exhaled air of an elephant on your head. I never dreamed I would know what it was like to feel three, heavy somewhat slobbery, and hairy trunks wrapped around my head and shoulders. It is a totally different experience than riding them which I have done several times before. Best of all, you get to hug these big, beautiful, and warm elephants. You can touch their tails, feel their tusks, and wipe their slobber off your shoulder. It's a spiritual experience. Needless to say my son pictured here loved every second of it. Anouk Zijlma 5. Lunch with Elephants \nA wonderful bush brunch complete with mimosas ends the whole experience. Sandi and Doug join you for the meal, so you have lots of opportunity to ask more questions. The 3 elephants eat right beside you, their brunch consists of bark and bushes and other elephant delectables. We got to hug Jabu's trunk as he joined each of us for our last photo opportunity at the table.
