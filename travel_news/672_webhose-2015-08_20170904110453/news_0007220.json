The capital city has enough culture and history to easily fill in the gaps between meals. Photograph by: SeanPavonePhoto , Fotolia \nAs I bit into a fat shrimp at the Mercado da Ribiera , I had to lean over my plate to prevent garlic sauce from dripping onto my lap. \nThe shrimp were spanking fresh and sautéed in enough garlic to cure whatever ails you. Better yet, even with a generous glass of local beer, my bill was under 10 euros. \nIt was the perfect introduction to Portugal , an ideal destination for food and wine lovers on limited travel budgets. Compared to France and Italy, your euro goes further in the southwest corner of Europe, which boasts more than two dozen distinct wine regions and Mediterranean cuisine that ranges from classic to cutting-edge. And there’s more than enough culture and history to fill in those pesky gaps between meals. \nThe world has been hearing a lot about Portugal recently, often in the same breath as Greece – both are struggling with precarious economies and massive foreign debt. But aside from a noisy protest outside a failed bank and a one-day strike by subway workers, it was hard to see many signs of financial strife on my recent trip there. \nIn the country’s two most populous cities, Lisbon and Porto , streets and cafés were crowded with tourists and locals. The Mercado da Ribiera, the massive food hall that opened last year adjacent to Lisbon’s biggest farmers’ market, has proven to be such a hit that it’s just about impossible to find a seat at one of the communal tables after 8 p.m. It’s the same story at Cantinho do Avillez , a casual restaurant that’s one of several in Lisbon run by chef José Avillez. His two Michelin stars help explain why all the tables were packed on a Wednesday night, and his food clears up any lingering mystery. \nA gazpacho made with fresh cherries, cottage cheese and dry cured ham was a rousing start and a lemon sorbet with basil and vodka made a bracing finish. \nIn between, Avillez’s takes on traditional Portuguese dishes such as tempura-battered green beans and Farinheira sausage were fresh and inventive. And the bill (before wine) for four starters and two desserts, enough for two people with light appetites, was a very reasonable 37 euros. \nAlso worth checking out in Lisbon is the Tagide Wine and Tapas Bar , a casual bistro in a beautiful building that also houses the more formal (and much pricier) Restaurante Tagide. Order the clams bulhao patio (in olive oil, garlic and white wine) or the salted cod served on a bed of chickpeas, and you’ll go home full and happy. \nEven though you’ll likely have to wait in line to get one, you can’t leave Lisbon without having at least one of the signature custard tarts, called pastéis de Belem, at the Antiga Confeitaria de Belem , which has been cranking them out since 1837. They’re just over one euro each, so have two. The bakery is a short walk from the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos – a well-preserved lategothic monastery that’s well worth seeing – where the tarts were first made by resident nuns more than 200 years ago. \nPortugal’s second-largest city, Porto, is no slouch in the food department. An easy (and cheap) three-hour train ride north of Lisbon, it’s a pretty city rising up on either side of a river valley. It’s also one of the oldest cities in Europe, boasting buildings that date to the 13th century. \nIf you’ve saved up for one spectacular dinner in Portugal, you can’t go wrong having it at the restaurant at Porto’s upscale Yeatman hotel , where Ricardo Costa presides over the one-Michelin-star kitchen. His inventive dishes, which included savoury starters in the shape of tiny ice cream cones and macarons when I was there, make for a memorable dining experience. \nI also love to eat where the locals do, and Os Lusiadas fits that bill. This unpretentious restaurant in the port area of Matosinhos specializes in fresh seafood. The salt-crusted sea bass, which is flambéed and fileted at your table, is as succulent as it is showy. \nOf course, you’ll want to wash down just about any meal in Portugal with some of the country’s excellent wines. And close to both Lisbon and Porto, two of the country’s wine regions are well worth a side trip. \nThe Alentejo region is anchored by the charming town of Evora , about an hour and a half by train from Lisbon. Spend at least half a day touring the cobblestone streets of the city, picking up some souvenirs made with cork from the region’s trees, and stop for a lunch at the Café Alentejo . Try some locally raised black pork and an Alentejo specialty, migas, a side dish made from bread fried in olive oil and garlic. \nYou’ll need something in your stomach to tour some of the area’s wineries, which are dotted throughout the scenic region. They produce everything from crisp whites and rosés to complex reds. And if you’ve never tried a vinho verde, or “green wine,” this is the place to do it – an excellent bottle of the light, young wine can be had for around 10 euros. \nThe Douro wine country east of Porto is the only place in the world that produces the fortified wine known as port. You can drive its rolling hills from quinta (wine estate) to quinta, stopping for a tasting or lunch if you’re the driver, remember most ports are about 20 per cent alcohol). \nIf you can’t make it to the Douro region, visit one of the major port producers in Porto – Graham’s , Sandeman’s and Taylor’s all make high-quality ports – for a tasting and a bottle or two to take home. \nThe writer was a guest of the Porto and Northern Portugal tourism board, the Alentejo tourism agency and the Portugal tourism board. The article was not read or approved of by these hosts before publication. \nIF YOU GO \nGetting there: From Vancouver, it’s easiest to fly direct to a major European city such as London or Frankfurt, then change planes for Lisbon. Several airlines fly direct from Toronto or Montreal to Lisbon or Porto. \nStaying there: The Vila Gale chain has several comfortable properties in Portugal, including the fairly central Opera hotel and the seaside Palacio dos Arcos. In Porto, the Hotel da Musica has small but contemporary rooms in a good location. In Evora in the Alentejo wine region, the Convento do Espinheiro offers stunning rooms and a spa in a converted convent. \nDon’t miss: In Lisbon, the Casa-Museu Medeiros e Almeida is a meticulously preserved “house museum” that was once home to a wealthy businessman who collected art and beautiful objects. In Sintra, about a half-hour’s drive from Lisbon, explore the magnificent castles and palaces built between the 10th and 19th centuries. \nIn Porto, the Lello bookstore was said to have inspired J.K. Rowling’s vision of Hogwarts with its stunning carved central staircase and stained-glass ceiling. The nearby second-floor shop A Vida Portuguesa has a beautiful collection of Portuguese-made products. In the Alentejo region, the hilltop town of Monsaraz is one of the oldest settlements in Portugal and has cobblestone streets with charming shops and restaurants. © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T19:19:08.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
