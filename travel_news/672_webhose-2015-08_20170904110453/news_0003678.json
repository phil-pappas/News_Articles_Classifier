If you’re into family activities, consider climbing the O2 with your kids or organising a water fight in your garden . And if you’re looking to make new friends (or reconnect with old ones), why not up the stakes and try a street dance class ? (Forty-year-old dad Harry Wallop just about managed it! ) Or, if you’re an adrenalin junkie, why not take on something to get the pulse racing, such as learning the flying trapeze ? In the meantime, #WhyNot enter the competition for the chance to get back to nature – with all home comforts – on a week-long family glamping holiday? Choose any Feather Down Farm location across the UK and enjoy a captivating camping experience in a fully-equipped luxury canvas lodge, with everything you need for a truly comfortable stay in some of the most scenic locations in the country.
