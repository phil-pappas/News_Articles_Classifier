( NASDAQ:MAR ) is a recipient of the 2015 CIO 100 Award . The 28th annual award program recognizes organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. \nMarriott is being honored for its Application Programming Interface (API) Platform, a new, centralized way in which the company collects and distributes data, and delivers its applications. Launched in 2014, the Platform provides a core application infrastructure, application development tools, and an evolving catalog of APIs, which enable Marriott to make strategic, efficient, and cost-effective business decisions. The Platform has also reduced mobile release delivery times from four-to-six months to four-to-six weeks. Most importantly, through the Platform, Marriott is able to execute game-changing mobile releases that provide a seamless, technology-driven guest experience. \nLeveraging the API platform, Marriott was able to release an application enabling Marriott Rewards members to check-in and checkout, receive room ready alerts, review their reservations, and receive directions to the hotel on their Apple Watch . Marriott also just introduced Mobile Requests , which enables guests to request services and amenities from their mobile devices before, during and after their stays at select Marriott Hotels. Further, Marriott has recorded more than 2.7 million mobile check-ins to date, an industry first and testament to the companys commitment to pushing the innovation envelope. \nMarriott continues to transform its mobile and digital technology to seamlessly serve and connect with guests throughout their travel journey, said Bruce Hoffmeister, global chief information officer, Marriott International. The API Platform has truly revolutionized how we approach mobile applications, how we deliver data, and how we can best deliver consistent and relevant experiences for our guests. We are honored that our efforts have been recognized by CIO magazine. \nFor 28 years now, the CIO 100 Awards have honored the innovative use of technology to deliver genuine business value, said Maryfran Johnson, editor in chief, CIO magazine & events. Our 2015 winners are an outstanding example of the transformative power of IT to drive everything from revenue growth to competitive advantage. \nAbout the CIO 100 \nThe recipients of this years CIO 100 Award were selected through a three-step process. First, companies filled out an online application form detailing their innovative IT and business initiatives. Next, a team of external judges (many of them former CIOs) reviewed the applications in depth, looking for leading-edge IT practices and measurable results. Finally, CIO editors reviewed the judges recommendations and selected the final 100. \nComplete coverage of the 2015 CIO 100 Awards are available online at CIO.com and in the August issue of CIO magazine. \nAbout Marriott International, Inc.
