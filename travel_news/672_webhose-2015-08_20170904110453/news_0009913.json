It would be another deployment option for our passengers – we haven’t had a ship in this region since 2001. \n“And then there is the bigger step,” Stuart said. “This would be to deploy a ship in Asia, for the Asian market. It is an important region that we are not currently represented in as Norwegian Cruise Line.” \nAsked whether the move announced today would be promoted to the Chinese market, Stuart conceded that the new itineraries would “be on sale everywhere”, but added: “We don’t expect to carry many guests from China for this season. Asia in mind \n“Asia has been on our mind for some time though,” he said. “The Asian market is on our radar. We have hired a senior person – Bill Harber – to be our senior vice president of Asia, a new role that we created, which is based in Hong Kong. \n“He reports into Harry Sommer, who is our executive vice president of international, which is also a new role – so that shows the energy that we’re putting into our international market.” \nQuestioned as to whether he would consider placing one of the line’s new ships into the region (it currently has two Breakaway Plus ships on order due for delivery in 2018 and 2019, in addition to Norwegian Escape which launches in October 2015), Stuart conceded: “We wouldn’t rule it out”. \nHe also admitted that as with competitor Royal Caribbean, Norwegian would have to customise any ship placed in Asia, to tailor it for the Asian market. “No decisions have been made yet,” he added, “but watch this space.” \nElsewhere, Norwegian has revealed it will be offering itineraries to more South American destinations, ranging from seven to 20 nights and visiting ports in Argentina, Chile and Brazil on the Norwegian Sun. \nNorwegian Epic is also being moved – the ship will continue to spend its summers in Europe, but will return to the US in autumn, as Norwegian’s largest ship to homeport in Port Canaveral, to sail a number of Eastern and Western Caribbean and Bahamas itineraries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T15:15:32.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
