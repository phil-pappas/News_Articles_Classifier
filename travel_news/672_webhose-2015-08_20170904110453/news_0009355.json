Head to the Starwood website and register for the deal by July 14 2016 using the first six digits of your World or World Elite MasterCard card number and the promotion code you received in step 1. During the registration process, sign in to your existing SPG account if you’re already a member, or join Starwood Preferred Guest if you’re new to the program. Stay at least once at a Starwood hotel within the Asia Pacific region before July 14 2016 on a room rate that would ordinarily accrue Starpoints – that’s any publicly-available rate when making the booking directly on the Starwood website. Pay for your booking in its entirety, including the room rate and any additional charges such as restaurant dining and room service, using the MasterCard World or World Elite card you registered in step 1. Wait patiently for 2-6 weeks for your Starwood Preferred Guest status to click over to Gold. Enjoy your new privileges on future stays with Starwood!

So you're expiration would be 2017 I believe. But unfortunately Hawaii is not one of the participating hotels as it is out of the region considered Asia. Australia does count though, so it might be worthwhile for you to consider just checking into a local Starwood for a one night stay to qualify for Gold and then you may get your benefits when you go to Hawaii.\n0 report reply 1 6 days, 17 hours ago by ajobbins Looks like it's only 1 year not two. I since registered and the email I got following says:\n\"Congratulations! You are entitled to recieve Gold Preferred benefits for 1 year after you have made one eligible stay in Asia Pacific using your World or World Elite MasterCard by July 14, 2016.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://chrischamberlin.com.au/follow-on-google-plus/?rel=author", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt", "http://www.spg-asiapacific.com/worldmastercardgold/en/?EM=VTY_SPG_WORLDMASTERCARDGOLD_PROMOTION", "http://twitter.com/#!/MusoJournoChris"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:22:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
