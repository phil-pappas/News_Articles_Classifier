Located inside a historic building that was once home to The British North American Tobacco Company, the washroom maintains its heritage but has a modern, classy, and unforgettable look. The washroom was the vision of the restaurant owner herself, with no detail overlooked. As you enter the women’s washroom, you feel like you’ve stepped backstage at the theater, with bulb lights around the mirrors and beautiful exposed brick. One of the standout features includes faucets that come directly out of the mirrors. The upstairs unisex washroom maintains the same retro feel but builds off the playful atmosphere of the pub. Features include entrances on both sides and a three-faucet trough-style sink. \n(Courtesy) \nBNA Brewing Company & Eatery in Kelowna, British Columbia \nThe washroom at this brewery and restaurant transports visitors back in time.
