Among the project slated for Brooks that will benefit from the bond funds are the restoration of the historic Hangar 9 structure and the development of a new town center. The funds will also support the creation of a new linear park. Hangar 9, constructed nearly a century ago, initially housed what became the basic training aircraft for pilots who flew missions during World War I. It was restored more than 45 years ago and at one point housed the U.S. Air Force Museum of Aerospace Medicine. The museum closed when the Southeast San Antonio base was shuttered several years ago.The restored hangar could accommodate a number of community events that draw more people to the former base. Brooks City Base President and CEO Leo Gomez said the bond program will finance costs associated with key capital improvements needed to “accelerate development” on the site of the former military base. Gomez told me developers have made it clear Brooks needs to make more infrastructural enhancements. \"This will allow us to entice more development,\" he said about the projects that will now be possible as a result of the bond funds. Some of the bond money will be used to develop a new Embassy Suites by Hilton on the 1,300-acre Brooks City Base campus. The funds will also support engineering and design work for the extension of South New Braunfels Avenue to Loop 410. The hope among Brooks City Base leaders is that the capital improvements will generate more development activity — especially in the northern and western quadrants of the campus. Those are areas, according to Gomez, that are ripe for more residential and retail development. \nWant San Antonio Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
