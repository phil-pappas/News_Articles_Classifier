Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 14, 2015 Menu Planning Banners   \nA series of short courses for hospitality personnel already in the work place and interested to improve their skills is being offered by Boma International Hospitality College, a partnership between Boma Hotels, and Swiss Alpine Center. Many hotel staff, as are their managers, are keen to see them attain better skills and short courses, dedicated to a specific field or topic, and this is one way of accomplishing this. \nMost of the short courses are taught conveniently during evening hours and range between 12 and 40 hours following which exams are administered. Topics covered range from “Housekeeping for Room Stewards” to “Menu Planning” but also include revenue management, HACCP, Customer Care and Guest Relations, and an introduction to ITC. \nThe evening courses were specifically launched to meet the demands of employers who are ready to sponsor staff for additional training but cannot spare them for the regular 12- to 24-month full-time courses, reflecting BIHC’s recognition of a new market segment, making use of study rooms and teaching staff during evening hours when the regular students are taking a break. \nHospitality industry sources have warmly welcomed the new initiative and options made available by BIHC, which in a short period of time has already left its mark on Kenya’s and the region’s hospitality training standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T08:53:24.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
