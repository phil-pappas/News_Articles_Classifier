Relaxed, multi-course dining, with carefully matched wines is the order of the day. Fancy a sensational view with your main course? No shortage of those either. Whether you are looking for a stunning desert landscape, a neatly tended vineyard or views of Sydney Harbour, Australia will conjure up the ideal backdrop. The flavours are equally as fresh. A new generation of chefs is showcasing Australia’s wonderful regional produce – from the finest oysters to grain-fed beef, truffles, heirloom tomatoes and native seeds and fruits. Australia has never tasted quite so good. Tali Wiru, Uluru The desert at night is a magical place. Known as the Red Centre due to its rich ochre sands, it also offers the world’s most spectacular sunsets. What better way to enjoy this sight than from a candle-lit table overlooking Uluru, below, and the distant domes of Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory? One of the signature experiences at the Rock is Tali Wiru, a fine dining experience under the stars. The four-course meal showcases native ingredients such as kangaroo, crocodile and barramundi, plus conventional European dishes. The magical evening includes a didgeridoo performance as well as indigenous storytelling. Penfolds Magill Estate Sitting on the edge of the Adelaide Hills in South Australia and surrounded by 170-year-old vines, Magill Estate is best known as the birthplace of Grange, Australia’s most expensive wine. Less well known is the estate’s culinary excellence. Visitors can dine in the newly opened cellar door which, apart from hosting tastings, serves delicious bistro-style fare. Or, for something more substantial, walk over to the restaurant, which offers a seven-course tasting menu by head chefs Scott Huggins and Emma McCaskill. Their delicate, Japanese-inspired dishes are paired with wines drawn from the estate’s historic cellars. Both venues command sweeping views of Adelaide and Gulf St Vincent. Lake House, Daylesford Just 90 minutes from Melbourne you’ll discover Australia’s most bewitching country retreats. Known for the excellence of its cuisine and its capacious wine cellar, the Lake House in Daylesford lies deep in the heart of Victoria’s spa country. Gourmet destination, spa retreat or fine country hotel? The Lake House is all of these things, but at its core is the elegant and timeless dining room – a magnet for generations of Melbournians. Alla Wolf-Tasker is a pioneer of sophisticated regional cooking and her restaurant boasts commanding views over Lake Daylesford. Berowra Waters, Hawkesbury River Ever gone to lunch by seaplane? This is your chance. Berowra Waters, a sleek, modern waterfront building, is one of Australia’s most discreet dining venues. There are no roads here – guests can only reach it by motor launch or seaplane from Sydney. The pavilion-like dining room sits on the banks of the Hawkesbury River, above, and is surrounded by dense forest. Chef Brian Geraghty, who trained at Pied à Terre in London, serves a degustation menu as glamourous as this magical location. Royal Mail Hotel, Dunkeld Before the opening of this restaurant few people had heard of Dunkeld, a small country town on the edge of The Grampians mountain range, in Victoria. These days, foodies from around the world are beating a path to its door. Why? Simply because the Royal Mail Hotel (a three-hour drive from Melbourne) has established itself as one of the shining stars on Australia’s regional dining scene. Inspired by Spanish chef Ferran Adria, its owners have transformed this country pub into a uniquely Australian culinary destination, famous for its intricate modern dishes, amazing walled garden and astonishing wine list. The Source, Hobart The arrival of MONA (Museum of Old and New Art) has transformed Tasmania’s international profile. Apart from the monumental art gallery, the sprawling waterfront also includes a winery, high-end pavilions, a microbrewery and The Source, surely Hobart’s most stylish dining room. The playful, French and Asian-inspired cuisine is a delightful counterpoint to the panoramic views of the Derwent River. Dishes range from hand-made gnocchi with scallops and poached hens’ eggs with shiitake mushrooms to wild caught hare with black pudding cream and sloe berries. Icebergs, Bondi Beach, Sydney Most cities are content with one signature view. Sydney has several, from Sydney Harbour to Manly and Bondi Beach. Swimming or surfing on this giant curve of sparkling ocean, above, is a time honoured pastime. So is dining at Icebergs, a bold white space perched at the southern end of Bondi. The Italian-influenced menu is perfectly suited to this sunny, seaside location in the New South Wales capital, with modern dishes featuring the freshest of ingredients. The Fish House, Burleigh Heads From Pacific Oysters to pan seared scallops, whole baby calamari, steamed mussels and oven baked ocean trout, The Fish House in Burleigh Heads, Queensland, is rightly celebrated for the quality, and variety, of its seafood. Indeed, this is one of the few places in Australia serving Patagonian Toothfish; even the fish and chips here are on the posh side, featuring Tiger Flathead from New South Wales. Hidden behind a modest exterior, The Fish House just oozes class. Hospitality, crisp service and classical European cooking are the cornerstones. The prices are modest, service exemplary and views perfect. Kangaroo Beach Picnic, anywhere One of the simplest pleasures in Australia is enjoying a picnic on the beach. Pack a hamper with succulent fresh produce from a local farmers’ market and head down to the sands for lunch. You may even be joined by a few curious kangaroos. There are plenty of stretches of National Park coastline where the marsupials roam free. Pebbly Beach in New South Wales is one such spot, or try the beaches of Queensland’s Cape Hillsborough. Qualia, Great Barrier Reef Occupying the northern tip of Hamilton Island, this world-class, above, resort serves up unmatched views of the Whitsunday Islands, with some of the most polished dishes on the Barrier Reef. The Long Pavilion, open to resort guests only, reflects Queensland’s laid-back attitude to life, but the food here is carefully considered and well executed. Scottish-born chef Alistair Waddell is truly passionate about what he calls \"nature cuisine\" and his menu features the very best local produce.
