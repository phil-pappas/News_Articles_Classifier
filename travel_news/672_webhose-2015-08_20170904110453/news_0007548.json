The first festival was Sept. 8, 2001 . Mrs. Bush served as honorary chair of the festival through 2008.

From its beginning in 1800, the Library of Congress was housed in the U.S. Capitol. During the War of 1812, the British burned the Capitol in August 1814 , destroying the Library's collections. A month later, Thomas Jefferson , in retirement at his Monticello estate, offered to sell his personal library to the Library of Congress. The 6,487 volumes were considered to be the most comprehensive library in America at the time.\n\"The Library of Congress is so pleased to collaborate with Detroit Public Television and PBS to help connect book lovers all over America with the authors, discussions and energy of the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. ,\" said Marie Arana , co-director of the festival.
