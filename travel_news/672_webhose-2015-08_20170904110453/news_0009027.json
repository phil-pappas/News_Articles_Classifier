Lippuner, who joined Four Seasons in 2008, was steeped in the art of hospitality from a young age. His passion for the industry led him to this current position.\nWith a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Kwazulu Natal in South Africa, and after working at several high-end hotels in Atlanta and Santa Monica, Lippuner left the hotel industry to launch a cosmetics business, which soon became a leading skincare manufacturer in South Africa. Lippuner’s heart was always in hospitality though, his primary passion, and he returned to it as Director of Housekeeping at the former Four Seasons Resort Aviara in Carlsbad, California. Over the next seven years, he advanced to Director of Residences at Four Seasons Resort Nevis, then to Director of Rooms and finally Hotel Manager atFour Seasons Hotel Washington, DC before joining Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh as General Manager.\nLippuner is nothing if not dazzled with his first assignment as General Manager. “The property occupies the tallest tower in Riyadh; its banquet and event space is the largest in the city; and the service and attention to detail delivered by the team is par none,” he comments. “There is much to impress visitors to the capital of Saudi Arabia, but the hospitality I have experienced since my arrival is in a word – exceptional. It is a telling trait and natural part of the culture here.”\nMoving from the city of Washington DC, Lippuner, his wife and young daughters are ready to experience the dynamic, warm desert life in Riyadh, with hope that his children will learn to speak the Arabic language during their stay.\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T14:03:25.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
