A police officer is on the line. Come quickly, the officer says, something terrible has happened to your child.\nThis is how Ian and Helen Barker, along with their son Glenn, found themselves driving from their home in the Victorian town of Benalla to Wangaratta Hospital just before 11pm on March 7, 2002.\nThe Barkers’ vivacious and sporty 16-year-old daughter, Anj, had been brutally bashed by her erratic and controlling ex-boyfriend* on the grounds of Benalla’s local high school.\nWhen they arrived at the hospital, a doctor advised them “not to go and see her” because Anj’s condition was so bad. The feeling Helen had was “indescribable”.\n“At one stage a nurse came out, just not long after we had arrived, and handed me her necklace, which was covered in blood.\n“I can remember just standing there holding it. Looking at it and thinking: ‘Oh my God. What has he done?’,” Helen says.\nIgnoring the doctor’s advice, the family waited to see Anj. Meanwhile, medical staff were urgently working to stabilise her before she could be airlifted by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital.\nHelen then overheard a conversation that will stay with her forever.\n“The police had rang and a doctor had been called out to speak to the police. The doctor said: ‘No, she’s not dead yet’,” Helen recalls.\nAnj Barker was bashed beyond recognition. Source: Supplied\n“I nearly collapsed,” she says, adding, “the police apparently wanted to know whether he [Anj’s ex-boyfriend] was going to be charged with assault or murder.”\nWhen the Barkers finally saw their beloved daughter, she was unrecognisable. Her head was swollen and she was covered in blood and bruises. Anj’s head had been hit against a steel bench multiple times. She had been strangled and kicked and her face had been stomped on, smashing her jaw and fracturing her skull.\n“There was tubes everywhere,” Helen says, and “her ear was really swollen and there was blood running out of her ear.”\nAnother nurse told the family this wasn’t just blood but brain fluid too and they should prepare for the worst.\nAnj didn’t die from her horrific injuries but instead, embarked on a long and often painful recovery. She spent eight weeks in hospital, four months in rehab and another two years in a nursing home. It took her five years to learn to talk again.\nThe severity of Anj’s injuries and her courage in speaking out against domestic violence, have led to national and international recognition.\n‘There was tubes everywhere’. It took Anj five years to learn to talk again.

Using her slow and deliberate voice, she says that her goals are to “keep getting better and improving and being happy”.\nSmiling widely, Anj is pragmatic about her life.\n“It’s just how it is,” she says and goes on to explain that she’s started working at a major bank two days a week and hopes to get married one day.\nShe yawns many times during our hour-long interview and Helen explains that fatigue is an ongoing symptom of brain injury.\n“That’s the thing about brain injury, if Anj doesn’t continue her therapy every day she can lose what’s she’s gained. It’s a lifelong journey,” Helen says.\nAnother possible result of brain injury is depression. It’s often seen as a mental illness, caused by being in a violent relationship. But some experts ponder whether this may be a secondary consequence of traumatic brain injury.\nJo Lake refuses to feel sorry for herself. Source: YouTube\nJo Lake, 35, was just two years old when she was savagely beaten by her teenage mother’s then-partner, resulting in head injuries.\n“They originally thought I would be a quadriplegic,” Jo says, “they said that I would never walk, never talk or never see again.”\nShe proved doctors wrong and leads a busy, productive life despite ongoing physical issues, cerebral palsy and long-term depression.\n“I just try and keep myself busy and that’s why I don’t actually start getting down or feeling depressed,” she says.\nJo laughs easily and refuses to feel sorry for herself. As a child, she was fostered by loving family who later adopted her. She forgave her perpetrator long ago and this accepting attitude is the same approach she takes to her injuries.\n“I’m not ashamed to have what I have. It’s hindered me in some ways, but I’m definitely not ashamed of having brain damage. I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t,” she says.\nAnj Barker was an Australia Day ambassador along with domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty.

It’s likely to be similar to those already used in the United States.\nMs Byrne also hopes to implement awareness training for these workers.\n“The evidence is out there. It’s time to stop looking at the research. It’s time to start doing something about it,” she says.\nIf you need support or counselling for domestic or family violence issues, call 1800 737 732 (1800 RESPECT). It’s a 24/7 national service, so it doesn’t matter where you live.\n* The family wishes not to name Anj’s assailant in this story.\nGinger Gorman is an award winning print and radio journalist, and a 2006 World Press Institute Fellow.
