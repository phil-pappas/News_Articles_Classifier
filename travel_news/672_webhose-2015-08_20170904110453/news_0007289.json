Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 21, 2015 eTN   \nThe breakaway faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), furious about the regime’s latest shenanigans in Addis Ababa where Salva Kiir refused to sign the peace deal, has now put added pressure on the regime by threatening to cut the main road link from Uganda to Juba. \nThis comes hot on the heels of another regime critical journalist being gunned down in Juba only days after Kiir in one of his regular outbursts threatened the media houses working in South Sudan with retaliation over their critical reporting of his reluctance to embrace the peace deal. \nRoad transport of goods and passengers is quintessential for the survival of the regime and for supplies from neighboring countries, and the road from Nimule at the Ugandan border to Juba is a critical link for that. \nIt could not be ascertained if the announced closure has taken effect, but going from past experience, such announcements have an immediate impact on in particular bus operations, as the operators fear to get caught in the crossfire should hostilities break out. Cargo companies also have their trucks on such occasions, remain at the Ugandan border in a wait-and-see attitude to avoid having their vehicles shot up. \nThe SPLM-IO, the latter letters standing for “In Opposition,” has of late increased its operations and expanded its sphere of control along the Nimule area, leaving for now only air transport as the safest way to travel from Uganda to Juba. RwandAir under fifth freedom rights, flies daily from Entebbe to Juba, keeping the air lanes open for travelers while road transport is once again in doubt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T04:05:43.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
