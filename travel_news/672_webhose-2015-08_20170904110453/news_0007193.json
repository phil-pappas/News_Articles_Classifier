The TTG top tweeters list for 2015 19 August 2015 \nThe list is carefully compiled by the TTG team, as we scanned the world of Twitter for the well-known - and some lesser-known - faces of travel offering witty commentary and insightful observations about the industry - and world - at large. \nAs always, the number of followers and number of tweets is taken into consideration, as well as those who ensure both personality and humour feature regularly in their 140 characters. We have, however, excluded those who simply retweet others or use the social network solely to market their brand. \n@Degsycom Derek Jones, Kuoni UK, managing director Kuoni’s loquacious UK boss has been a constant in the Top Tweeters list since we started back in 2012, and his informal yet authoritative style keeps winning over new fans.
