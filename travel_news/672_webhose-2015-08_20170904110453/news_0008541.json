This is a particularly attractive service for business travellers. However, the early morning and evening flight connections are also ideal for a short tourist break in the city on the Thames.\nThe SkyWork Airlines flight from Bern will make a short stopover at the EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg.\nThe flight times are being optimised with effect from 31 August. This will extend the length of time in London by over an hour. However, because of a public holiday in the United Kingdom, there will be no morning flight on 31 August.\nThe morning flight leaves Bern at 06.00 from Monday to Saturday, arriving in London at 07.30 local time (LT). The evening rotation (Monday to Friday) departs Bern at 17.25 hrs and arrives at the City Airport at 18.55 hrs. (LT). The return flight to Bern is scheduled for 22.50 hrs. As per the current timetable, there will also be an early evening flight on Sundays.\nMartin Inäbnit, CEO of SkyWork Airlines: “In response to the wishes frequently expressed by our customers, we are stepping up the connection to London City and doubling the capacities.”\nThe flights to London Southend (SEN) will continue\nIn addition to LCY as a classic business destination, SkyWork Airlines will continue to operate non-stop flights from Bern to London Southend. This small, convenient airport to the East of London is ideal for passengers who aren’t in a hurry. Starting from 25 October 2015, the departure time will be rescheduled to midday with the introduction of the winter timetable, the ideal arrival time for a relaxing evening in the pulsating metropolis of London.\nThe airline currently operates five flights a week to SEN in its timetable (departure from Bern 18.35 hrs, return flight from SEN 19.45 hrs local time and arrival in Bern 22.25 hrs). With the start of the winter timetable, the frequency will be adjusted to four midday flights a week.\nDue to lower airport charges, the flights to London Southend are normally better priced than those to London City.\nSource:- SkyWork Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:33:05.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
