Photo by Jan Tuckwood With 100-plus stores and restaurants, it’s heaven for strollers who like to shop and eat.\nHere are a five of my favorite stops on St. Armands:\nKing Neptune: Sprinkled around the circle are more than 30 statues based on Ringling’s own Renaissance collection. King Neptune rises from a median right by the famed Columbia restaurant , and statues of lovely ladies — the “Seven Virtues” — include statues representing music, tropical plants and the bounty of land and sea. There’s even a statue of Michelangelo.\nNeptune and Columbia. Highlights of St. Armands. Photos by Jan Tuckwood The Shore : This fashion shop is classy-meets-surfer-cool. It’s my favorite clothing store on the circle, which also features chains like Chico’s and Tommy Bahama.\nBlu Kouzina … for baklava and more: This Mediterranean restaurant is my favorite spot for a fresh Greek salad and tasty baklava.\n“Circle Ring of Fame”: In the center of St . Armands is the Circle Ring of Fame, a walkway of plaques honoring circus stars with ties to Sarasota. Lou Jacobs, the famous Ringling clown, and his daughter, aerialist Dolly Jacobs, who still lives in Sarasota, are celebrated among 115 or so others, including John Ringling himself.\nShore is my fave clothing store … on St. Armands Circle.

A new one is the Charleston Shoe Co., from Charleston, which specializes in shoes made of elastic bands.\nCharleston Shoe Co. has been on St. Armands Circle for a year.
