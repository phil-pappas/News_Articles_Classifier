Luis, who is well-known in the global hospitality industry having worked in it for more than 30 years, will start on 1 September, overseeing all operational activities at Le Quartier Français. \nBased at Le Quartier Français, Luis’ initial main focus will be to ensure continuity after the recent acquisition of this iconic property by Leeu Collection. The acquisition is in line with the manifestation of Indian businessman Analjit Singh’s vision for sophisticated escapes and unique wineland experiences, which comprises in the first phase, Leeu Estates (a 21 room, five-star luxurious boutique hotel and winery in the picturesque Franschhoek valley) and Leeu House (an exclusive and private five-star 12-room boutique hotel in the heart of the Franschhoek village). Luis’ role was created after the purchase of Le Quartier Français and the imminent opening of Leeu House and Leeu Estates. Born in Mozambique, Luis has a Diploma of the American Hotel & Motel Association in Hotel Management and has managed properties such as the Mount Nelson and Table Bay hotels in Cape Town, Reid’s Palace in Madeira and the Lapa Palace in Lisbon. His vision and business knowhow will serve him well in this new endeavour. “I am excited to be part of Leeu Collection. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities in this new position and am eager and energised to start this new journey,” said Luis. According to Hector de Galard, President Business Operations for Leeu Collection, this position was a natural progression as the property portfolio in Leeu Collection expanded. “We share Luis' excitement taking Le Quartier Français already iconic lifestyle experience to exciting new levels. With proven leadership expertise and a strong passion for his team and operational excellence, he is the ideal person to manage Leeu Collection's growing presence in South Africa.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:11:29.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
