Tomlin plays the matriarch who embarks on a quirky, ultimately endearing road trip with her pregnant teenage granddaughter (Garner).\n“Julia is just such a natural,” Tomlin said. “On set, nothing would throw her. By and large, that’s pretty rare to have an actress that is serious about her work but also doesn’t see herself as a baby.”\nIt was a vote of confidence that any young actress would be lucky to get. But Garner said there were so many more unspoken moments on set that made Grandma a real learning experience. “Sometimes when you’re working together, you’re so busy working with your character that you don’t even have to talk about things or ask for advice. Just being with Lily, just watching her, even now, is extraordinary.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-08-20T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T01:15:44.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
