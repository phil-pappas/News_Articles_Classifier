One of the initial targets is potential new nonstop service between the Alamo City and Boston. San Antonio Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Richard Perez has reached out to a number of area companies, including the organization’s members and partners in an attempt to drum up support for expanded air service. “This is a critical initiative for our 2015 (chamber chairman), Henry Cisneros , and one that we know is very important to the business community and our future economic development,” Perez wrote in a letter to local business leaders. “Increased air service and nonstop flights to key destinations from San Antonio is critical to our continued growth and success as a business community and tourism destination.” The chamber has delivered a survey to a number of area businesses seeking feedback on the city’s air service needs. One of the questions is about the demand for nonstop service to Boston, one of the nation’s key bioscience hubs. Health care and the biosciences is San Antonio’s largest industry, and the city could benefit from greater connectivity with Boston. Perez said that chamber officials plan to reconnect with local business leaders in the fall to gain additional data that will help San Antonio officials identify additional destination targets and determine their next step. The outreach is part of a larger San Antonio Air Service Development Strategy which could ultimately provide area passengers with more flight options. Late last month, I reported that CheapFlights.com had released its annual ranking of 101 U.S. airports based on average airfares. Based on data collected from trips booked through the website to popular domestic and international destinations in June, the average airfare for flights out of or into San Antonio International Airport was $434, ranking the city No. 71 on the list of least expensive airports. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport fared much better at No. 16. Its average ticket cost was $293. One of the reasons Austin is a more affordable — and attractive — point of departure for air travelers is the availability of more flights. “I’ve done it myself,” said San Antonio City Councilman Joe Krier in a previous story about the trip some Alamo City residents make to Austin to catch a flight. “People go to Austin because they can catch nonstops they can’t get here.” \nWant San Antonio Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:01:59.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
