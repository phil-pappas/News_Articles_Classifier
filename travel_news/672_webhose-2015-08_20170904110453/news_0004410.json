James , Executive Vice President & Chief Diversity Officer of MGM Resorts International. “We are extremely proud of the model of compassion and giving our employees represent, and of the improvements their generous donations will make in the quality of life for so many families and individuals in need.”\nThe MGM Resorts Foundation was established in 2002 to provide employees with a vehicle for supporting nonprofit organizations in the places they call home. Since the Foundation’s inception, company employees have raised a total of more than $65 million and supported thousands of charitable organizations of their choice. MGM Resorts pays for all of the administrative costs to raise and disburse the Foundation’s funds through grants and donations so that every cent donated by an employee can go directly to community recipients.\nThis year, a record 61 percent of the company’s 62,000 employees pledged support to community nonprofits through cash and payroll donations. Funds have also been raised through Foundation-hosted fundraising events such as its annual employee sport tournaments.\nThe 2015 campaign numbers reflect a 10.7 percent increase in the employee participation rate with 25 percent more dollars pledged than in 2014. Every year an employee Community Grants Council distributes donations not ear-marked for specific nonprofit organizations or programs into a grant fund with awards based on a competitive proposal process. This year, the Council awarded 91 grants.\n“Our employees recognize that there is a lot of need in our communities and we are committed to helping,” said Joe Maddox , Community Grants Council member. “By pooling our resources we contribute to making a positive impact on tens of thousands of people. There is no better feeling than knowing we can make such an incredible difference and touch so many lives.”\nExamples of community services supported by the Foundation’s grants this year include:\nChildren and Youth: Community-based programs which focus on the overall development and well-being of children and youth considered at-risk. Education: Public education programs which enhance student learning, from kindergarten through higher education. Hunger Relief: Food bank distribution programs that provide children, families and other individuals access to food they otherwise would not have. Mental Health and Substance Abuse: Recovery and counseling programs that help families, children and individuals affected by addictive behaviors, mental health problems, or other special life circumstances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:19:43.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
