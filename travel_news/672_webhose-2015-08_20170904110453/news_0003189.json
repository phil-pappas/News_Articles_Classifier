Officials at McCarran International Airport say the airplane bound for Fresno, California, departed just after 4 p.m. Saturday when witnesses say they saw flames and heard explosions from the engine. Airport spokesman Chris Jones says there were no injuries and the aircraft landed safely. Jones says Clark County firefighters inspected the airplane but found no evidence of a fire. Allegiant Airlines says the flight had to return because of a compressor stall in the left engine but the engine did remain operational. The airline says no engine fire suppression system had to be implemented. Passengers later boarded a replacement aircraft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:40:49.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
