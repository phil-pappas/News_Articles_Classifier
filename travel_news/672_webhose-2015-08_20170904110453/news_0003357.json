The donations, ranging from £500 to £1750, were awarded to the locally based groups which included an amateur football club, an established youth project, a community centre and a dementia charity. The Fund places priority on supporting projects linked to education, the environment and economic regeneration in the Aberdeen City and Shire area, and donated over £25,000 in 2014.\nThe Fund’s Board meets four times a year to discuss applications received and award donations. A total of 12 applications were received for the second round, held in June, and the 4 lucky groups were selected based on a strong application demonstrating a real benefit to the local community.\nAmongst the selected groups was the Fersands and Fountain Community Project, a voluntary organisation based in Woodside which aims to provide advice, education and support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach families in the area. Money awarded by the Fund will go towards the running costs of a youth activity flat currently run by the charity. Claire Whyte, Community Worker, from the Project said “The Project, and all the young people we work with in the Ferriers/Sandilands area of Woodside, would like to say a huge thank you to the Airport Community Fund for supporting our youth work project. The money awarded to us will go towards the cost of running our youth flat that is based in the heart of our community where the majority of our youth work is based”.\nJohn Law, Community Fundraiser at Alzheimer Scotland, who were also awarded funds towards an awareness campaign, said “We are really delighted to have been given this grant by the Airport Community Fund. It will allow us to extend and develop the work we do with schools, the universities and the college in Aberdeen and for students and young adults to better understand issues surrounding dementia. I look forward to working with the various partners and the airport to make our project a great success”.\nThe two other lucky groups securing funding were Kintore Football Club who were awarded a donation for its new football kit, and the city’s Sunnybank Community Centre, who will put the donation towards ‘English for speakers of other languages’ (ESOL) classes for local people.\nDan Peck, Development Manager at the airport and a member of the Fund’s Board, said “It was another strong round for the Community Fund and it’s great to see so many innovative projects on-going in the local area. We’re thrilled to be able to support the four organisations which cover a range of causes in the local community”.\nThe next round of the Airport Community Fund will meet on Friday 25th September 2015.\nSource:- Aberdeen Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T13:54:44.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
