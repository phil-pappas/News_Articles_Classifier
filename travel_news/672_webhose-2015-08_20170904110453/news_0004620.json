As the average fuel price of Singapore kerosene for the month of July in 2015 was US$65.91 per barrel, the benchmark fuel price used for calculation of the fuel surcharge level will be within the range of US$65.00 to US$69.99 per barrel (refer to table below). \nThe international cargo fuel surcharge will therefore be 45 yen per kg on long-haul international routes, 33 yen per kg on medium-haul international routes, and 23 yen on short-haul routes. \nInternational Cargo Surcharge", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T20:51:40.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
