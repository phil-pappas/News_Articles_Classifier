He is about to start studying Real Estate and Property Development at the University of Reading. I have skied all my life in Europe, so for my gap year I wanted to get out and experience somewhere different. Canada seemed like the ideal option. I came across Nonstop’s 11 Week Ski Instructor Course online, and for me the big deciding factor in choosing the course was that we would get to train in all three of the resorts in Banff – Lake Louise, Sunshine Village and Mount Norquay, something that wasn’t offered by any other company. I also really liked the sound of all of the extra activities that we could do on the weekends – dog sledding, building and sleeping in snow caves and cat skiing as well as trips to other resorts. The highlights were definitely passing my CSIA (Canadian Ski Instructors’ Alliance) Level 1 and 2 instructor qualifications. Also the amount of skiing we managed to fit in – during a 95-day stay in Banff (we arrived before the course started and stayed on to make the most of our season pass), I skied on 90 of those days. It’s been amazing to meet so many new people, making friends with course mates and instructors and now feeling part of a community and having links with people all over the world. • Gap year 100 directory It was great to learn how to work with many different people from various backgrounds. There is a customer service focus within the CSIA assessments, which will definitely be useful in a lot of different situations. I’ve learned to manage people and be patient whilst teaching them. If I try to get some work in the UK snow centres, I know my qualifications will get me hired • Gap year 100 directory Obviously the course has also helped me ski like a god! I liked to think I did before, but was soon proven wrong when I arrived. My people skills have improved and I’ve made lots of friends along the way. I would love to go back to Canada again one day, but for the moment that plan is on hold whilst I go to university. I’ve now got a better chance of earning some money while studying. If I try to get some work in the UK snow centres, I know my qualifications will get me hired. I’m just not sure that skiing in a snow dome compares to a US National Park! If anyone else is considering a gap year on the slopes, I’d say definitely do it- it will be one of the best decisions you ever make.
