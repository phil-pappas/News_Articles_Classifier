And now the topic has caught the attention of the U.S. Senate.\nA Senate report released Thursday took a critical tone on such fees, which have greatly expanded both in scope and price during last 10 years. The report – based on an investigation by the Democratic staff of the Senate commerce committee – concluded the government should consider a crackdown on fees charged for items like seat reservations, bags and ticket changes.\n\"The traveling public is being nickel-and-dimed to death,\" Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), the panel's top Democrat, says in a statement accompanying the study's findings . \"What's worse is that many fliers don't learn about the actual cost of their travel until it's too late.\"\nFULL REPORT : The Unfriendly Skies: Consumer Confusion Over Airline Fees (Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation)\nUSA TODAY\nAugust's #avgeek gallery: 30 cool aviation photos\nNelson said via the statement that he intends to \"press his colleagues to act on the report's recommendations when the Senate begins its work on legislation reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration.\"\nAmong the criticisms in the report is that there seems to be little – if any – tie between the price of a fee and the \"service\" for which the fee is being charged.\n\"For example, many airlines charge a fee for a second checked bag that is substantially higher than the fee for the first checked bag, even though there appears to be no cost justification other than increased profit for doing so,\" the report says.\nThe report echoed a similar tone on change fees, noting they vary significantly by ticket type and make no accommodation for how far in advance changes are made. The report suggested change fees should be limited to \"a reasonable amount tied to lead time prior to departure and a maximum percentage of the original fare paid.\"\nThe report made numerous other recommendations, including better disclosure of add-on fees and a requirement that airlines \"promptly refund fees for any bags that are delayed more than 6 hours on a domestic flight.\"\nThe airline industry pushed back against the findings, saying most were unfounded.\n\"It would be difficult to find an industry that is more transparent than airlines in their pricing,\" Jean Medina, spokeswoman for the Airlines for America trade group, said in an email to The Associated Press. \"The fact that a record number of people are traveling this summer further demonstrates that customers always know what they are buying before they purchase.\"\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.\nTWITTER: You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky\n26 CONNECT 37 TWEET 5 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1SYTLup TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TodayInTheSky", "http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=9c2a9a8d-ac5f-4ba4-b623-85919c322906", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/143ad8777246d0b0d5c88b8946bf8a8fb330106d/c=82-0-1359-960&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745306531836304-AP-Airline-Fees.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1SYTLup", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1SYTLup&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ed26f2eb46673785cf92671be1a0b097be5bca8/c=133-0-667-534/local/-/media/2015/08/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635744487562202970-USATAugust-3.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1SYTLup&text=Senate%20report%20calls%20for%20government%20crackdown%20on%20airline%20fees&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745306531836304-AP-Airline-Fees.jpg", "http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&File_id=79d9b832-3d92-48a4-af4f-9a4cce28f5ae"], "published": "2015-08-07T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T00:18:46.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
