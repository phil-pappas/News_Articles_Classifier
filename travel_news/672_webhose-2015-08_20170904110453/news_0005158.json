Monday August 17, 2015 Print Article \nGeorgia May Jagger is the face of jeweller Thomas Sabo’s new campaign. — Picture by Thomas Sabo via AFP-Relaxnews LONDON, Aug 17 — With summer vacations in full swing, we interviewed the British-American model, the face of jeweller Thomas Sabo’s new campaign, on the staples of her summer wardrobe to ensure a 100 per cent fashion vacation. The internationally renowned model, who is the daughter of Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, tells us that a suitcase without a bikini is not an option when she’s vacationing at the beach. \nWhat three things must you have with you on vacation? \nA high SPF sunscreen, my camera and a good book. \nWhat item from your wardrobe do you bring with you no matter where you vacation? \nFor summer: bikinis. I buy a new one every time I go on a beach vacation. \nWhich staple accessory follows you everywhere you go? \nMy engraved Love Bridge bracelets. For summer, I particularly like disc bracelets in blue and turquoise that you can have personalised with engraved dates or initials — very romantic. \nDo you have a beauty tip to look your best on vacation? \nWear as little makeup as possible. I like the minimalist style when I’m on vacation. But I do like to wear a little gold eye shadow at night. \nDo you have an unusual story from a past vacation? \nI just went to Cambodia and was really impressed by Siem Reap and the temple of Angkor Wat/UNESCO World Heritage. This was really an amazing vacation. \nWho do you dream of going on vacation with? \n(Smiling broadly) My boyfriend. — AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:02:37.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
