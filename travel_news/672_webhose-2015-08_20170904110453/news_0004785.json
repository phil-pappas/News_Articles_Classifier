Look at how we have made Pak Nasser Nasi Lemak into a brand itself. We have people travelling from all across the region wanting to order our Nasi Lemak and this Malaysian dish is a standout in our in-flight menu. Our food is as good as restaurant food ― it’s not just in-flight food and this is what we want to achieve with ‘Santan’ ― introduce a new gourmet in-flight dining experience which features cuisines from across Asean. We are starting with AirAsia and AirAsia X flights after the launch today, but we will be implementing this across the whole group by October.” \n“While we continue to give low fares to our guests, we are increasing the value with new product offerings such as Premium Flex, Premium Flatbed, and the introduction of this new gourmet experience on board is part of us moving in that direction,” added Tony Fernandes. \nApart from the new pre-book meals on AirAsia Berhad (AK) flights, guests are now able to add a sweet ending to the meal of their choice with the introduction of the ‘Maximise Your Meal’ option which includes a Salted Caramel Cookie Bar and a Kit Kat for only RM7 to complete their in-flight meal. \nThose travelling with children on both AirAsia Berhad (AK) and AirAsia X Berhad (D7) flights can now pre-book the Kids Meal which consists of two mini chicken burgers and Ribena. ― Bernama More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:10:01.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
