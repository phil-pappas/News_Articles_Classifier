At midnight, the slate of nominees will be finalized for the 2015 edition of this exciting contest.\nThe number of fantastic nominations has grown in the past few weeks, with entries coming from Newfoundland to British Columbia and everywhere in between. The variety of streets, neighbourhoods and public spaces that have been nominated and the unique communities that rally around them showcase the many vibrant flavours of Canadian life and culture. The local pride and unification inspired by each of these great places is very apparent on greatplacesincanada.ca . Great Places in Canada gives a splendid snapshot of our vast country, and contest aside, an excellent way to discover new places in Canada as presented by their citizens.\nWe've had new nominations in the Public Space category which include Witless Bay's Lower Pond Beach & Conception Bay South T'Railway in Newfoundland , and Lethbridge River Valley in Alberta. Orangeville Ontario's Broadway , Main Street Osoyoos in British Columbia and Pictou Lobster Carnival in Nova Scotia are battling it out for votes in the Street category. Historic Downtown Amherstburg and Cookstown , both Ontario entries, have joined the other contenders in the Neighbourhood category, bringing the total to four. There are 2 weeks left until the deadline, and, historically, a great number of entries are submitted under the wire.\nMedia, both social and print, have jumped on the opportunity to bring more attention to their local nominee and the engagement continues to be impressive. Voting has been very active among top contenders for People's Choice in all categories.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP), is convening a jury of professional planners who will be judging the final list of nominated places in each category. It is this jury which will create the list of finalists and ultimately award the title of \"Great Place\" to the most deserving nominee based on a variety of planning merits.\nSo why did CIP create Great Places in Canada 5 years ago? The institute felt it was a fun way to engage Canadians in sharing their favourite places and to recognize the work accomplished by professional planners to make these places possible. It's a fun contest that is free and rewarding. Every community has at least one place that defines its character. Sharing that place and winning the designation of \"Great Place in Canada \" will put a feather in the cap of the individual who initially thought to nominate the place.\nVoting closes September 24 th , 2015, three weeks after nominations close. After the finalists are announced in October, the Grand Prize winners and People's Choice winners will be declared November 4 th , 2015, in conjunction with World Town Planning Day.\nPrizes are being provided by the contest's generous sponsors, VIA Rail Canada and Roots Canada. Communities in Bloom and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) are also providing invaluable support for this year's edition of Great Places in Canada .\nVisit greatplacesincanada.ca to nominate and vote!\nFor winners from previous years, visit www.greatplacesincanada.ca .\nFollow @GreatPlacesCA on Twitter Like our Great Places in Canada page on Facebook\nGreat Places in Canada is an annual contest hosted by CIP and it is now in its fifth year.
