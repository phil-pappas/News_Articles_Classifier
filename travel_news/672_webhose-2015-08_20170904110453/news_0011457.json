Talkeetna is the base for expeditions into the wilderness: 10,000 square miles of Denali national park with Mount McKinley, the US’s highest mountain, at its centre. In winter, it can be as cold as -40F, but in summer I sat in shirtsleeves at the town microbrewery listening to locals’ tales of the Talkeetna Moose Dropping festival, a celebration of the creature’s dung. Lumps of moose poo are dried, varnished and individually numbered, before being dropped from a chopper as a kind of town lottery.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stream in the Talkeetna mountains. Photograph: Stefan Arendt/Corbis\nFor a tiny town, it certainly courted controversy when US animal rights activists got the wrong end of the (presumably shitty) stick and tried to put an end to it, thinking that the festival involved lobbing the animals from helicopters, rather than their droppings. Long dark nights can last up to 19 hours out here, you have to make your own entertainment.\n• A Portrait of an Idiot as a Young Man by Jon Holmes (Orion, 12.99) is out now.
