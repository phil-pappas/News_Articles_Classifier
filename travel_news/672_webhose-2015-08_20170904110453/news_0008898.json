The 49-year-old man was taken into custody after members of the Harris County Sheriff's Office High Risk Operations Unit and Hostage Negotiation Team negotiated his surrender.\nDeputies were called to the home about 9 p.m. Saturday to perform a welfare check, Harris County Sheriff spokesman Thomas Gilliland told KHOU-TV (http://bit.ly/1HyVKtb ). Gilliland said deputies later received information indicating that a man inside the home was wanted on a warrant for aggravated assault on a family member.\nIn this image made from a video, police arrest a man after he surrendered Sunday, Aug. 9, 2015, in Houston. According to authorities the bodies of multiple people including several children were found inside a Houston home following his arrest. (Photo via AP Video) Gilliland said while waiting for a High Risk Operations Unit to arrive, deputies spotted the body of a juvenile through a window. Four deputies forced their way into the home, prompting the suspect inside to begin shooting. Deputies pulled back and waited for the operations unit to arrive. The man surrendered about an hour later.\nThe relationship between the suspect and victims wasn't immediately known. No further details were released. Officials say more information will be given at a news conference set for 3 p.m.\nThe area around the home was still cordoned off Sunday morning, with sheriff's deputies coming in and out of the house and the medical examiner's office having arrived at the scene.\nIn this image made from a video, police arrest a man after he surrendered Sunday, Aug. 9, 2015, in Houston.

About 11 p.m., he said, deputies started going around the neighborhood knocking on doors.\n\"Cops were walking around with their handguns out, telling people to remain in their houses. They were also telling them to evacuate. It was extremely scary,\" he said.\nCartagena said he heard one gunshot but wasn't sure if there were more.\nIn this image made from a video, authorities investigate after reports of an active shooter in a home Sunday, Aug. 9, 2015, in Houston.

She said she was sitting in her driveway when she heard gunshots coming from the house and officials then told her and her family to go inside their home.\nMercado said she could still see from her bedroom window and watched as a man was escorted out of the house after midnight. She said officials then had him next to her fence, taking fingerprints and photographs.\n\"It was shocking. I haven't slept all night,\" she said.\nIn this image made from a video, authorities investigate after reports of an active shooter in a home Sunday, Aug. 9, 2015, in Houston.
