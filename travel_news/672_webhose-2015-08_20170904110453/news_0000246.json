Before we get started this morning I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first- and second quarter 2015 10-Q and our 2014 10-K under management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and also under risk factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement which is available on our website. At this time I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Peter Hancock. Peter? Peter Hancock (President, CEO): Thanks, Liz, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I would like to discuss key highlights from the second quarter, the progress we're making towards our financial targets, the quality and strength of our balance sheet and provide an update on capital management. I am pleased with our overall momentum and believe our scale and focus on being our clients' most valued insurer will lead to continued success across our businesses. Turning to page three, our key operating metrics trends include improved combined ratios for Commercial insurance. Strong alternative investment returns contributed to investment income despite pressure on consumer-based yields. John and Kevin will provide additional comments on the performance of their respective businesses and how they have been positioned for sustained profitability. Our second quarter results demonstrated our commitment to balancing growth, profitability and risk. We are on track to reach our targeted 10% growth in book value, excluding AOCI and DTA for the year. We are making progress on our 3% to 5% expense reduction target but have more work to do. Book value per share excluding AOCI and DTA was over $62, up 3% for the quarter and 10% from a year ago. We expect continued growth in book value per share as our business deliver on improved profitability and we deploy excess capital. Following the update to our capital plan, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 124% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.28 this quarter which highlights our growing confidence in sustainable earnings. Given the substantial increase to our dividend, we will include dividend growth in the 10% or more book value growth target. On the expense front, we continue to simplify our businesses and processes while continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure which is driving our 3% to 5% in net expense reduction and allows us to focus on providing the greatest value to our customers. David will provide additional details on general operating expenses in his remarks. The shifting profitability dynamics of Commercial insurance markets impacted our second quarter ROE but does not diminish our outlook. We expect to reach our 50 basis point target for the year adjusted for the lost AerCap earnings and the timing of capital deployment associated with the AerCap sale proceeds. Continued underwriting improvements and expense reductions are the essential keys to reaching this target. We also believe that the current normalized ROE under GAAP doesn't fully reflect actions taken in recent years to build intrinsic value and further enhance balance sheet quality. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T20:50:39.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
