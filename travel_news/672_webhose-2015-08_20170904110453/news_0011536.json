She raised most of her large gray head, quickly opened her jaws wide and then, as if thinking better of the effort, sank back beneath the water.\nIt was only a minute or so, but it made up for the 3 a.m. wakeup call, the chilly flashlit walk across camp and the almost two-hour ride over the washed-out crossings and scarred surfaces that pass for roads in the Serengeti. (All right, seeing two lionesses suddenly appear alongside the Toyota Land Cruiser had helped a bit, too.)\nWe arrived around 6 at the launch site, where a handful of guys in orange jumpsuits or worn work clothes were pointing a high-powered fan into one of the two balloons going up that day. The nylon blob, what enthusiasts call the envelope, was stretched across the dry grass, shifting and billowing as it filled with air.\nOnce we were aloft, the sun was a streak of pink on the horizon. But within 20 minutes, it became too bright to see clearly, so I turned to focus on the river and the vast vista of the Serengeti, its straw-colored grasses already tinted with a light green after two days of sunset rain.\nMore hippo eyes visible just above the water’s surface; a couple of large crocodiles, inert on the banks. A few Thomson’s gazelles wandering nearby. And in a small bare patch, a lone wildebeest looking up at the balloon.\nThe day before I’d seen a column of wildebeest race toward the far bank and throw themselves into the water, a couple of thousand animals following the leader of the moment across the river to a new grazing area, a favorite tourist feature of the seasonal migration. They all made it across, but another tourist said an even larger group that crossed later in the day hadn’t been so lucky. The crocodiles had been waiting.\nAs we floated over the spot, some of the carcasses were stuck among the river boulders.\nI never expected that, not even in my imaginary video.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T09:49:20.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
