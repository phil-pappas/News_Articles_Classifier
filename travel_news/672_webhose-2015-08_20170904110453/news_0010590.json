Over and above strengthening our brand, this will create additional employment opportunities in the surrounding communities. Our portfolio has doubled in only four years and The Richards acquisition is just another step towards our goals,” comments Samuel Nassimov.\nPremier Hotel The Richards, formerly owned by HPF, marketed by Protea Hotels and managed by Extra Bold, is unique to the Group’s 14 existing properties and fits the stable as a 4 star product.\n“We were first introduced to this hotel 2 years ago and concluded negotiations of break fees and price over the past 4 months. With the strength of our loyalty programme coupled with the business market need in the region, we see great potential for this property especially within the conferencing and corporate sectors,” he adds.\nThe classic hotel currently offers comfortable four-star luxury accommodation, a fine-dining restaurant, and conference facilities for up to 300 people. With this property being an operational and sellable product in its current state, the company plans to enhance it to Premier Hotels & Resorts standards by improving some aspects, including the conferencing facilities. This will be done whilst trading as normal, with no disruption to guests who will continue to enjoy the true Premier experience of exceptional deliverables.\n“We are very excited to have the opportunity to add this beautiful hotel to the family. It is conveniently situated for both South African and foreign visitors wanting to explore the unspoilt beaches and coastal conservation areas. With Richards Bay being one of the fastest-growing cities and industrial centres in South Africa, I see great possibilities for Premier Hotel The Richards to become the leading recreational and business destination in the region,” Nassimov concludes.\nOther positive attributes to the hotel include the nearby Richards Bay Country Club, and the fact that it is a convenient stopover for guests that are on their way to the popular game reserves in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The hotel is also a popular venue for weddings.\nNassimov, who founded Premier Hotels & Resorts twenty four years ago by purchasing an old 40 bedroom hotel in East London in the Eastern Cape, has grown the company’s portfolio to encompass fourteen hotels and resorts throughout the country. The group now offers more than 1 500 bedrooms and provides employment opportunities for 1300 passionate staff. ELICC (East London International Convention Centre), which was awarded the Best Congress and Convention Centre Africa in 2011, also forms part of Premier Hotels & Resorts.\nSource:- Premier Hotels & Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:06:39.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
