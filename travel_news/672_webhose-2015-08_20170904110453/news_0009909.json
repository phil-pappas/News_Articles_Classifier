Discovery of the debris, which may finally confirm the plane crashed into the sea after veering off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew, could help end 16 months of uncertainty for relatives.\nAviation lawyers said it had also rekindled efforts by family members of passengers to seek greater compensation if the part is deemed to have belonged to MH370, aviation lawyers said.\nExperts hope the 2-2.5 m (6.5-8 feet) long wing flaperon and a fragment of luggage could yield forensic clues to the fate of MH370.\n\"We know the flaperon has been officially identified as being part of a Boeing 777 aircraft,\" Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said in a statement.\n\"This has been verified by French authorities together with aircraft manufacturer Boeing, US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Malaysian team.\"\nLABORATORY ANALYSIS\nThe plane part was flown to Paris on Saturday and was taken to Toulouse to undergo more detailed analysis.\nRepresentatives from Malaysia, the United States, China, France and Boeing are due to participate in a \"verification\" of the flaperon on Wednesday.\nLow said Malaysia is contacting authorities in territories around Reunion to see if they can help if other objects suspected to come from a plane are found.\nMore pieces of metal debris found washed up on Reunion were taken into police custody on Sunday but it is too early to say what they are, said a person close to the French investigation.\nDiscovery of the debris may finally confirm MH370 crashed into the sea after veering off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, helping to end 16 months of lingering uncertainty for relatives of the passengers and crew.\nInvestigators believe someone deliberately switched off MH370's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course.\nThe debris will be examined at a lab staffed by 600 experts that is operated by the French defence ministry.\nThe luggage fragment has been sent to a police unit outside Paris for DNA tests.\nIf the serial number on the flaperon confirms that it is from MH370, then the laboratory can use sophisticated tools to try to glean more information about the causes of the crash, such as whether its shape corresponds more to a mid-air explosion or a crash into the ocean.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:03:35.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
