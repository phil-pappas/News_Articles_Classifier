The activities include throwing objects at vehicles, causing damage, interfering with passengers, racial slurs, allowing their children to wander onto the road and a general disregard for the safety of airport passengers, the general public and other taxi drivers. The noise they were creating was measured at more than 90 decibels on August 13th, and is interfering with airport announcements and communications among staff.\nThe Airport Authority has a comprehensive emergency response plan in place and has been adapting it to the changing conditions, with the support of the Ottawa Police Service.\nOn August 13th, the Airport Authority filed an application for an emergency injunction in the matter to cause the protesters to follow security and safety instructions and to maintain peace and good order. The application was heard by the Honourable Justice R. Beaudoin on August 14th . After reviewing the information submitted, Justice Beaudoin instructed the creation of a protocol that will limit the protest area, the number of protesters and vehicles, and restricts the kinds of activities permitted within the demonstration perimeter.\n“The safety and security of our passengers, employees and partners is not something that we will compromise,” said Mark Laroche, Airport Authority President and CEO. “While we respect the drivers’ right to protest, our primary concern is ensuring that our passengers have unimpeded access to the services and transportation options that suit their needs. We will continue to work closely with the Ottawa Police Service to enforce the protocol, and return the airport to normal operations as quickly as possible.\nThe judge’s instructions were very clear and the protocol offers a better environment for both parties. With a history of a good working relationship with both parties, I encourage Coventry Connections and the Airport Taxi drivers, to get back to the bargaining table, attempt to resolve their differences and come to an agreement that will work for everyone as quickly as possible”.\nSource:- Ottawa International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:13:10.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
