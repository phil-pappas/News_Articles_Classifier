Germain side Borussia Monchengladbach make up the group, meaning City have faced a Bundesliga side in every Champions League group they have ever been in. Two-time Champions League winners Juventus will come to Manchester along with Paul Pogba, who has been linked with a move to City for much of the summer, as long as he stays in Turin. How many times have Man City progressed from the group stage? Progressed? Yes 4 No 1 Sevilla finished fifth in La Liga last season but qualified for the Champions League as winners of the Europa League. Juventus are one of the more difficult draws that City could have faced but Manuel Pellegrini will be pleased to have avoided the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich. • Champions League draw: live Man City's Champions League record (excl. playoffs) City Win 10 Draw 6 Loss 10 This will be Manchester City's fifth season in the Champions League group stages. They have made it past the first round twice and twice more failed to progress. City have never come top of their group and have faced Barcelona in the second round both times they did make it through, falling to the Spanish giants on both occasions.
