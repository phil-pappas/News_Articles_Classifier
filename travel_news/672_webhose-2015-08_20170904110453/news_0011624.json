Several hundred experts will discuss issues related to the polluted environment and the emergence of various types of cancer. Due to a number of actual problems with the state of the environment, especially air pollution, holding the conference in the Czech Republic might be very beneficial for solving these issues. \nThe organizing scientific society of the EEMGS 2015 is the European Environmental Mutagenesis and Genomics Society, which encourages the study of mutagens and substances of related biological activity in the human environment, particularly as these mutagens may be of concern to public health. The local organizer of the event is the Czech and Slovak Society for Mutagenesis by External Environment of the Institute of Experimental Medicine AS CR. The C-IN team will be providing professional organizational services. Around 200 scientists from a number of European countries will have an opportunity within 4 plenary lectures led by the world's top experts, 14 symposias and several workshops to discuss the latest issues to toxic substances in the environment and their connection with a number of genetically determined diseases. One of plenary the lectures will be led by a scientist with Czech origin, Prof. Jiri Bartek, who holds the post of head of the laboratory Cell Cycle and Cancer in Kræftens Bekæmpelse in Copenhagen. His research is primarily oriented around the regulatory mechanisms of cancer cell division and the mechanisms leading to the formation of tumors. He is the author of nearly 400 scientific papers and articles, and one of the most quoted Czech scientists in biological and medical sciences. Prof. Bartek is among others awarded the Danish Association for Research on cancer (1998) and G.J. Mendel´s Medal for contribution to biological sciences (2003). David Phillips, another plenary speaker, is a Professor of Environmental Carcinogenesis at the Institute of Cancer Research, King´s College London. Professor Phillips' group studies the different types of DNA damage caused by a range of environmental chemicals, including tobacco smoke. Increasing our understanding of these processes will lead to improved ways of preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer. Dr. Jan Topinka from Czech Society for mutagenesis external environment about the Czech representation at the conference EEMGS: \"A number of Czech scientists will present at the conference. Prof. Marie Stiborová from the Faculty of Science of Charles University in Prague will discuss the results of studies of the mechanisms of activation of carcinogens occurring in the environment; Dr. Paul Rössner from the Institute of Experimental Medicine AS CR will talk about the possible adverse effects of nanoparticles used in biomedicine. Dr. Miroslav Machala from the Veterinary Research Institute in Brno will address the mechanisms of complex mixtures of substances in polluted air which is a long-term problem in the Czech Republic.” The EEMGS conference promises a busy and interesting program with a number of significant European experts.
