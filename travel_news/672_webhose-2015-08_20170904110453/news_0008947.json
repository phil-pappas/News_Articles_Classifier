For relatively short money, you can attend one of the world’s most-watched sporting events, see the action up close (as in: You can almost touch the players) and soak in all the exciting activity around the event. And with a two-week window of time, the US Open can work for just about anyone.\nMy husband and I are tennis fanatics. We play nearly daily all year round and have the Tennis Channel on constantly. We love the game, and our annual trip to the Open is like a pilgrimage. Some years, when time and finances are tight, we work it into one (albeit long) day. When our time and finances allow, we stay one or two nights and soak in as much of the Open as we can. Over the years, we’ve learned some tricks to making a trip to the Open just right.\nEven if you don’t live a tennis life like we do, The U.S. Open is a trip worth taking.\nGetting there: It’s not out of the question to do a one-day trip to the Open. Since play does not start until 10 a.m. daily, you can leave most Massachusetts spots by, say, 5 a.m. and get there in plenty of time. Of course, you’ll arrive home quite late but it’s so worth it if an overnight is out of the question.\nBut overnight is fun. We usually head down late afternoon the day before our first ticket day and overnight in New Haven, Conn., where we can feast on Pepi’s Pizza and then have dessert in Little Italy. It’s like a mini trip within the trip, and then we can wake up leisurely the following morning and head in for our day of fun. That first day, we stay all day and into the evening and either head home or back to our hotel if we are attending a second day. Believe it or not, you won’t have a moment of boredom if you stay all day.\nDriving is easy; parking is right next to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and is actually cheap. If you are on a train route, the 7 Train stops right at the gates of the Open. You can catch the 7 Train from Grand Central or Metro North, which means easy access from most Massachusetts Amtrak stops. Another choice is to drive to Connecticut, park at a train stop and commute from there, allowing you to relax sooner.\nWhen to go: Any day is great at the Open, but we are huge fans of the early rounds. In the early rounds literally every court is in action, which means you have a good chance of catching a huge name in action. We always choose Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday (or a combination of those days) in the first week when we are sure to catch a large amount of quality matches. If weekends are your only option, it is more crowded then, but the Open always draws a huge crowd so it’s not that much of a difference.\nWe like to arrive a good half-hour or more before the first matches start and take a look at our surroundings and the match lineup for the day. Then, before the action has started, we park ourselves in the stadium where we want to start the day. You can score some pretty awesome seats doing this. Last year, by luck, all the matches we were hyped about were in Grandstand. We scored front-row seats early and took in action close-up that was incredible. Later in the day we headed out to some smaller courts and took in more, seeing top stars on courts that were almost like watching them at your own town courts. That’s the bonus of the early days.\nWhat to do: It’s not just about watching tennis, even though the tennis is out of this world. The US Open is like a carnival of tennis life. The food is amazing (we love picking and choosing in the Food Village, where you can enjoy Carnegie Deli, farm-fresh food, amazing burgers, seafood and more. For a more upscale moment, you can pop in on one of the restaurants like Champions Bar and Grill. And you must stop by the Grey Goose Bar for the Open’s signature drink, the Honey Deuce.\nThere is shopping too: Last year I scored an awesome pair of tennis shoes for a song, and some cute outfits.\nYou can take part in some cool extras, too. Such as: How would you like to try to return Maria Sharapova’s serve? This year, a new (and free) element is the American Express virtual reality booth that lets you try to do just that. Return it? You get bragging rights. At Heineken House, just above the Food Village, you can sip on the beer, play table games and still see all the action on tons of TVs. And then there’s the crowd-watching, a sport in itself.\nTickets: For now, you only need special tickets for Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the headline events happen. But here is a tip, particularly in the first week, unless you really crave tickets there, you don’t need them. Grounds passes alone allow you into every other venue, and you can hop from one to another all day long, finding lots of top action all over. And if something big does happen in Ashe, giant TV screens on the grounds allow you to watch it all live while enjoying the setting.\nA trip to the Open is full of action for even those who barely follow tennis. And with the classic Grandstand stadium being torn down after this year, it’s the year to go.
