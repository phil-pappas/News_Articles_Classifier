I couldn't be happier,\" Ford said to the room of 7,500 fans. \nOutside of Star Wars, Disney harnessed star talent to drum up buzz for its other live-action films. \nJohnny Depp swaggered through the hall dressed as his Pirates of the Caribbean character Captain Jack Sparrow, as fans were told that Orlando Bloom's character, Will Turner, will return for 2017's fifth installment of the swash-buckling franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales . \nChris Evans presented the third installment of his Marvel superhero franchise, 2016's Captain America: Civil War , and fans were shown an action-filled clip. \nNyong'o was joined by Sir Ben Kingsley, newcomer Neel Sethi and director Jon Favreau for the upcoming CGI/live-action re-telling of The Jungle Book .
