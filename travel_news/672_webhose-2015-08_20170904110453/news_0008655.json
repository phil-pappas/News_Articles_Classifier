Further industrial action at the airport will continue from 9pm on Monday until 1am on Tuesday. \nAt Sydney Airport, action began at 6am and will continue until 10am. More strike action is scheduled from 8pm until midnight. \nThe Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) has given notice of work stoppages at \"all Department of Immigration and Border Protection work areas in all states\", a statement on the department website says. \n\"The department is working closely with stakeholders to minimise the impact on the travelling public and on cargo and mail operations,\" the statement says \n. \"We are ensuring appropriate contingencies are in place for visa and citizenship services. However, we strongly encourage passengers booked on international flights to get to the airport early.\" \nMelbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said delays were yet to occur, but she also asked international passengers to \"come in as early as they can, noting that check-in only opens three hours beforehand\". \nShe said the two strikes were planned during the airport's peak periods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T03:11:39.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
