The US Airways call center in Winston-Salem has recently been sold to an affiliate of a New York real estate firm for $15.3 million in a move that will mean business as usual for the facility's work force of more than 1,000. The sale of the building at 799 Hanes Mall Blvd. from Raleigh-based Highwoods Properties to New York-based United Realty for $15.3 million means \"nothing has changed,\" said Vickey Hoots , president of the Communications Workers of America Local 3640, which represents employees at the call center. \"It's business as usual,\" she said. \"We've done a lot of hiring, and we anticipate more hiring.\" Joe LeVine , managing director of New York-based United Realty, told the Triad Business Journal Monday that his company's acquisition of the 101,555-square-foot property closed in late July. The US Airways call center was an attractive investment that marks the company's first property in Winston-Salem, he said. \"The past owner and the tenant, US Airways, have taken great care of the facility and invested money into the facility prior to our acquisition of the building,\" LeVine said. \"We think that this was a great transaction where we can continue to generate above average risk-adjusted returns for our investors.\" He added that the facility in Winston-Salem is one of US Airways' core call centers, employing \"friendly happy people\" who generate some of the best customer service ratings in the country. LeVine said his understanding is that the facility's employee count has grown from 850 to more than 1,000 employees within the past 12 months. The facility employs reservation sales agents among other positions. LeVine said the facility will continue to be run and managed by the airline, which will remain the building's long-term tenant. \"They still have a long-term lease,\" he said. Highwoods Properties could not immediately be reached for comment. United Realty purchased the call center a few months before the US Airways brand retires this fall as part of the company's $11 billion merger with American Airlines . Katie Cody , an American Airlines spokeswoman, said the Winston-Salem facility will be known as the American Airlines call center starting in October. She said there are no plans to change the employee count at the Winston-Salem center. \"We have a significant presence there and have for a long time,\" Cody said. \nWant Greensboro/Winston-Salem Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox?
