PUBLISHED: 20:34, Mon, Aug 3, 2015 | UPDATED: 20:42, Mon, Aug 3, 2015 GETTY THE AZORES: More unusual but just as beautiful as the Caribbean and the Red Sea \nEuropean itineraries start to tail off in October, when cruise lines switch to warmer waters such as the Caribbean, the Red Sea and the Far East. \nThis is the time to snap up cut-price cruises that may call at more unusual places, such as Iceland, Canada and the Azores. \nThe down side, although not for people who just love being on a cruise ship, is that repositioning cruises are likely to include more sea days than conventional itineraries. \nTo make up for this the cruises are usually sold at good discounts, with extra lectures and enrichment programmes. \nTransatlantic voyages with a few unusual ports at the start or finish are among the most common repositioning cruises, as ships leave Europe for America and then the Caribbean. \nChoose a ship with plenty of onboard entertainment – particularly those with good spas, pools, sports facilities and evening entertainment – and you will hardly notice the eight or so days spent at sea. \nIf you are more interested in taking advantage of several days of peace and quiet to sleep, read and relax, make sure you choose a cruise line known for its extra-special menus – the more all-inclusive the better. \nOf course, repositioning cruises also take place in spring, when the Caribbean, Middle East and Far East itineraries are much reduced because of rising temperatures. \nAnd you should also watch out for new ships. \nAlmost all are built in Italy, Germany and France these days and launched in spring or autumn – just in time for them to cross the Atlantic over to New York or Miami for the new season. \nThis autumn will see Norwegian Cruise Line’s newest ship, Norwegian Escape, call at Southampton before heading off to Miami on a 10-day transatlantic crossing. \nBook one of the last cabins going and you will be among the lucky people who experience a cruise ship when everything is ship shape and Bristol fashion. \nFor more information go to www.ncl.co.uk .
