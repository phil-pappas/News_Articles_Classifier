International penalties remain at their previous amounts of US$25 to US$150, depending on the flight distance. \n\nVietnamese carriers have been under scrutiny recently for frequent delays. According to a report released last week by the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV), more than 21 per cent of all departures in the country took off behind schedule in July, up nearly six per cent from June. \n\nThe report cited an inability to manage high-season passenger capacity. Most of the late departures were the result of a domino effect caused by late incoming aircraft, according to the CAAV. \n\nWeather also contributed to the high number of delays, however. Heavy rains flooded parts of Vietnam last month. One of the two runways at Ho Chi Minh Cityâ€™s Tan Son Nhat International Airport was closed for repairs for four days after it was struck by lightning. \n\nInclement weather is one of several circumstances under which airlines are exempt from the new rule. Other exemptions include delays due to security concerns and passenger medical emergencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:03:28.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
