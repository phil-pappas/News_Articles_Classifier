New are a stunning row of tented cabanas at the infinity pool, a tented spa and a plein-air restaurant. The bungalow-style rooms have been updated with new floors and brass bathroom fixtures, while the architectural integrity has been kept intact. This adult-only oasis is instantly the chic-est sleep in the city. L'Horizon, 1050 E Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, 760-323-1858, lhorizonpalmsprings.com \nDine: The new Rooster and the Pig bills itself as Vietnamese-American street food with a focus on fresh ingredients and shareable dishes like pork lettuce wraps, crispy fish rolls and green papaya salad, all under $10. Get there close to opening time, or be prepared to line up. Rooster and the Pig, 356 S Indian Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, 760-832-6691, www.roosterandthepig.com \nPlay: Hipsters from Vancouver to West Hollywood refuel at Ernest Coffee on Stumptown coffee by day and, by night, craft rum at adjoining club, Bootlegger Tiki . Co-owned by former Vancouverite and photographer Jaime Kowal (who also owns the boutique Amado Hotel ) with her architect business partner, it's the cool-and-creative hub of the Springs. Ernest Coffee, 1101 N Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, 760-318-4154, www.ernestcoffee.com \nBrunch: The newly rebranded Avalon Hotel (once the Viceroy) has moved more of its restaurant seating outside, either poolside or in a new tented space filled with embroidered throw pillows, tie-dye runners and gold flatware. The menu at Chi Chi Restaurant is by chef Tara Lazare, who is rapidly expanding her fempire of SoCal cuisine, F10 Creative. Waiters here wear white sneaks -- all the faster to whisk shrimp burgers and fresh peach mimosas to your table. Avalon Hotel, 415 S Belardo Rd., Palm Springs, 760-320-4117, www.avalonpalmsprings.com \nDrink: While Mr. Lyons , a reimagined steakhouse from F10 Creative, has elevated the dining options several notches (and by several zeros), we prefer the adjoining bar, called The Lounge, for quiet tête-a-têtes and classic cocktails. Mr. Lyons Steakhouse, 233 E Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, 760-327-1551, www.mrlyonsps.com \nParty: Karaoke night at the Ace Hotel is where you can mingle with locals or just sit poolside eating juicy tacos from a new menu by Brooklyn's Five Leaves (the late Heath Leger's concept). Sit back, relax and watch all the craziness ensue, knowing that -- as the sign outside says -- \"Everything will be OK.\" Ace Hotel, 701 E Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, 760-325-9900, www.acehotel.com \nby Sarah Bancroft", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T03:29:50.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
