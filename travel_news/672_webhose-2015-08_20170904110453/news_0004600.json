For coach passengers who can’t afford to upgrade to roomier quarters, well, at least now there’s Airhook.\nInvented by Seattle-based entrepreneur Craig Rabin, Airhook latches onto your closed tray table to do double duty as a cup holder and electronic device mount. This way, you can put your laptop on your knees and still keep your drink handy.\nYou might be thinking: The airplane tray table already comes with a cup holder. But we all know that shallow circular indentation does little more than collect germs . Airhook holds your drink in an upright position and has an adjustable knob on the side to balance the cup at any angle—no matter how far the jerk in front of you reclines.\n© Provided by CityLab Airhook The universal device mount fits phones and tablets up to 7.5 inches tall and keeps the display at eye level so you don’t have to hunch over the whole flight. There’s even a hook to hold your headphones, keeping your hands free of wires.\nWith the Airhook deployed and your tray table folded up, you’ll have a little bit more room to maneuver on the plane. Yes, it looks incredibly dorky. But the next time turbulence knocks your flimsy cup of soda into your lap, you might wish you hadn't thumbed your nose.\nAirhook, $22 at theairhook.com .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2014/05/20/study-airplane-tray-tables-carry-much-more-than-your-soda-and-pretzels/", "http://www.theairhook.com/shop/the-airhook", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlqtKd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlqtKa.img&description=Airhook+-+Provided+by+CityLab", "http://www.citylab.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlqtKd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlqoCX.img&description=BlurLife1975%2fShutterstock.com+-+Provided+by+CityLab", "http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/07/the-most-hellish-design-for-airplane-seating-yet/398285/"], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:06:33.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
