Visitors check in by typing information into a screen, and their luggage is quickly whisked away by an automated trolley that delivers suitcases and bags to their respective rooms.\nGuests will have the option to stay in rooms without having a key which is possible with the latest face authentication system which will register the user through image recognition and let them into the room.\nOnce inside, a small doll-like robot on the bedside table will tell you the weather or the time, and turn out the lights when you’re all tucked in.\nEach room features the latest accommodations with modern design to provide a cool and stylish room that is essential for a comfortable stay. Sawada hopes to open more of its kind in Japan and abroad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:53:38.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
