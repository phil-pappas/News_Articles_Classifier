Young visitors will play-act parallel parking, driving a taxi and writing a parking ticket inside an interactive 3,000-square-foot gallery. They can pretend to be a construction worker by moving blocks with a conveyor. Or they can serve up their own creations at \"Taste of NYC Food Cart.\" They can also create their own music inside a soundproof laser tunnel. The museum says the goal is to develop children's social, cognitive and motor skills and help them make sense of the world around them. \"NYC & Me: A Little Bite Of The Big Apple\" will run from Sept. 24 to Jan. 18. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T13:16:54.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
