Hosted by well-known sideline reporter Julie Alexandria and Olympic silver medalist, Tim Morehouse, each show will feature unique segments with tennis’ elite players, celebrity patrons and dedicated fans, giving viewers an inside look at what goes on at the major competition. \nPlanned segments include: \n• On The Road Presented By Westin: A look at how players manage their non-stop travel schedules without sacrificing their fitness and mental wellbeing. \n• The Heat Index: A daily pulse check on what’s hot socially at the US Open, allowing audience members to participate in daily trivia polls, hot topics and more by following along with #beyondbaseline. \n• Best Of The Blue Carpet: Everything viewers need to know about the celebrity world at the US Open, including interviews from the Blue Carpet, live shots from the stands and on-set cameos. \n• All-Access Pass: The ultimate behind-the-scenes tour of the US Open’s inner-workings, taking the audience through the grounds, from the luxury suites and the player’s lounge, to the kitchens, all 17 courts, and more. \nSpectators who make it out to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center during the two week tournament can stop by the Baseline Stage located outside the East Side of Arthur Ashe Stadium next to the US Open Club each morning and evening to view a live taping. Beyond the Baseline will air every day during the tournament at 7pm EST on usopen.org/beyondthebaseline. \nTWO WEEKS OF TENNIS LOVE \nAs the action heats up on the court, tennis fans can cool down at The Westin New York at Times Square without missing a minute of the primetime excitement. To get guests in the game day spirit, Westin will present Match Point Hour an evening match viewing series featuring experiential activities so that fans can feel like they’re a part of the tournament action without leaving Manhattan. \nStarting Monday, August 31 through Thursday, September 10, from 6:30-9:00pm every night in Bar 10, guests and locals alike will be able to catch a live viewing of Beyond the Baseline and the evening matches. Spectators can test out their swing skills with a complimentary Wii™ tennis station, sip on fan-favorite Grey Goose® Honey Deuce, the signature cocktail of the US Open since 2007, as well as fuel up between plays with a tennis-inspired SuperFoodsRX® bar menu. On Thursday, September 3 through Saturday, September 5, Westin will also offer a special Tennis Gear Tune Up Station available for anyone interested in stepping up their game. Patrons can have their tennis gear evaluated, racquets restrung and receive a professional swing analysis from a tennis pro. \n\"All of the activities that Westin is offering during the US Open are designed to enhance the viewing experience and transport at-home spectators from their seats to the stadium,” said Bob Jacobs, Vice President of Brand Management, North America, Westin and Sheraton. \"Beyond the Baseline and Match Point Hour bring our guests closer to one of the sports’ most exciting tournaments, providing an opportunity for fans to discover new and playful facts about their favorite players, view matches in a beautiful, upscale environment and find inspiration to get moving on the courts themselves.\" \nThe Westin brand’s tennis offerings extend beyond the US Open to Westin Resort properties, where guests can move well on beautifully manicured courts during daytime and early evening hours. Players of all levels can enjoy match play, casual games, or lessons with the seasoned Westin pros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T23:12:58.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
