After a wet and dreary weekend and a chilly and windy start to the week, forecasters say temperatures are set to return to the summer norm, with the possibility of London hitting anything up to 30C (86F) on Sunday, the same as Ibiza. While a Northerly air flow is currently keeping temperatures in the low twenties and even late teens, a warm air flow from France is tipped to bring temperatures back to a summer-norm as August begins. While large parts of the country could see nightly grass frosts this week as temperatures drop to single figures, daytime temperatures will remain in the late teens widespread across the country. People sunbath on Cala Bassa beach Wednesday night will be particularly chilly with temperatures in Aberdeen dropping to between 3C and 4C, while areas as far South as Devon could see some frost, as temperatures drop to the mid-single figures. • UK weather in pictures: another day of snow and freezing temperatures However, a Westerly flow arriving on Thursday will make temperatures feel slightly warmer, but a warm air flow from France will bring up the heat from Friday on to Sunday, with temperatures peaking at the end of the weekend.

But the Met Office said temperatures will peak on Sunday, with highs that of between 24C and 30C. But an incoming low pressure system set to hit the UK on Sunday night will mean that the latest hot spell will be short-lived.
