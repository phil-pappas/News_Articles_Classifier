This groundbreaking program offers customers a valet to drive them home safely in their own cars after an evening out. Drive Home began piloting in San Francisco in June and has since expanded to Chicago , Seattle and Los Angeles .\nThe Drive Home service is one of the first of its kind to be fully covered under the company's $5M insurance policy for valets, drivers and cars. Luxe is also proud to announce that Drive Home launches in partnership with Mothers Against Drunk DrivingÂ® (MADD), where $1 from every ride will be donated to the cause.\n\"According to MADD studies, someone is killed by a drunk driver every 53 minutes. In Massachusetts alone, 36% of all traffic deaths are caused by drunk driving,\" says Lauren Sheerr , Luxe's Boston General Manager. \"Luxe wants to provide a solution. By allowing our valets to drive you home in your own vehicle, we are making the streets of Boston safer for everyone.\"\nUsers can choose the Drive Home option via the app's additional services menu at a cost of $25 plus an additional $3 per mile (12 mile radius cap, along the I-95 belt), and must do so up to one hour before closing. Once requested, the Customer Delight team will contact the user for the destination and return time. A valet will pick up the driver in his or her own vehicle and drive them safely back to their chosen destination before parking their car in the driveway and handing them their keys. Drive Home will be available throughout Luxe's Boston service area.\nLuxe's Boston service area includes the North End, Boston Common, Historic Downtown, Government Center, Financial District/Downtown Crossing, Waterfront, Leather District, Chinatown, Theatre District, Bay Village, Park Square and the majority of Back Bay. Current hours are: Monday to Thursday, 7am-10pm ; Friday, 7am-12am ; Saturday, 10am-12am ; and Sunday, 11am-7pm , with plans to extend in the future.\nAbout Luxe\nLuxe, the leader in on-demand parking, is headquartered in San Francisco, California .
