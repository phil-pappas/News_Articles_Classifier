There were times when people thought we are next to Iraq and maybe an area where bomb attacks are normal,” said Kulwant Singh, managing director of Dubai-based Lama Tours.\nWhile the GCC is viewed as a safe region, it has faced a series of security incidents in recent months. But analysts opine that the incidents are unlikely to discourage holidaymakers from visiting the GCC.\nDubai welcomed 13.2 million visitors in 2014, up 8.2 percent compared to the previous year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T08:14:54.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
