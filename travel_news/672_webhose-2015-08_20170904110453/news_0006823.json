Road safety messages in foreign languages are being considered to reduce accidents involving overseas drivers. \nRoad signs could feature safety messages in foreign languages in an effort to reduce the number of crashes involving overseas drivers on New Zealand roads. \nThe NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) has ordered electronic signs and is investigating ways of translating key messages as tourists continue to feature in a disproportionate number of road accidents in Westland, Southland and Otago. \nGerman and Mandarin are the main languages in consideration. The Europeans rank third behind Australians and the Britons for tourist driver numbers in New Zealand. The growing Chinese market is fourth. \n\"We need to reach people on the journey and we're looking to put [safety messages] in other languages, otherwise you're making it hard for some people who can't read our language,\" NZTA southern region general manager Jim Harland said. \nThe 290-kilometre route from Queenstown to Milford Sound is an obvious location for the new initiative â€“ between 2010-14 there were 51 crashes, nine deaths and 74 serious injuries on the road. \nNZTA data found overseas drivers were at fault in 24 of the accidents. \nThe percentage of fatal and serious injury car accidents caused by tourists has hovered around 6 per cent nationwide since 2001. The NZTA puts it at 5.7 per cent between 2010-14. \nIn popular tourist destinations, the ratio is considerably higher. The South Island accounts for 41 per cent for all crashes that involve overseas drivers. \nIn the tourist driver-heavy Westland and Queenstown-Lakes districts the ratios were 38 and 25 per cent respectively. \nBy comparison, just 5 per cent of crashes in Auckland between 2010-14 involved overseas drivers. \nNZTA research estimated 25 per cent of foreign drivers underestimated journey times on Kiwi roads so the signs could include estimated driving times, not just the distance to be travelled. \n\"On the West Coast in Hokitika, it might say 'Haast Pass 200kms five hours,\" Harland said. \n\"We're looking for how do we get the best information so that they're not trying to do the South Island in two days. \n\"It's all about when you're out of your comfort zone, how do we make sure the roads and road signs are sending you the right signals? \nNZTA is also doubling the frequency of \"keep left\" arrows from 5km intervals to 2.5km on some lower South Island roads. \nIt is also working on a pilot programme where \"keep left\" signs are posted as a reminder when exiting a tourist attraction. \n\"If you're relaxed and there's nothing much around on these low volume routes and there's nothing to follow, you might just go straight across the road [on to the wrong side],\" Harland said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T12:43:33.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
