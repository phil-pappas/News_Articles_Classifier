Chuck Schumer announced that he would vote to disapprove the nuclear deal with Iran, it was politically consequential. Schumer is a big-foot Democrat with political heft on the issue.\nSchumer’s influence on the debate, however, should be greater than just the political consequences of his decision. Although I reach a different conclusion, the statement Schumer released explaining his position provides a thoughtful and useful way of thinking about the deal.\nSchumer renders the usual criticisms of the specifics of the deal: the inspections regimen is too weak, the sanctions snap-back provisions too uncertain.\nBut he then says that the specifics of the deal are less important than the perception of Iran’s intent in entering into it: “Ultimately, in my view, whether one supports or opposes the resolution of disapproval depends on how one thinks Iran will behave under this agreement.\n“If one thinks Iran will moderate, that contact with the West and a decrease in economic and political isolation will soften Iran’s hardline positions, one should approve the agreement ….\n“But if one feels that Iranian leaders will not moderate and their unstated but very real goal is to get relief from the onerous sanctions, while still retaining their nuclear ambitions and their ability to increase belligerent activities in the Middle East and elsewhere, then one should conclude that it would be better not to approve this agreement.”\nSchumer thinks Iran wants the money from sanctions relief while continuing to develop a bomb, so he opposes the deal.\nI also think that ultimately the evaluation of the deal depends on the perception of Iran’s intent in entering into it. But I would frame the choices differently than Schumer, which leads me to a contrary conclusion.\nThe most immediate question isn’t whether Iran is likely to moderate over the next decade. The question is whether there is a reasonable chance that it is willing to defer the development of a bomb for at least ten years.\nIran’s nuclear program has progressed to the point that the assumption must be that it is capable of developing a bomb if it decides that possessing one is a strategic necessity. If Iran wants a bomb, it will have a bomb.\nBut Iran appears to have decided that, at least for the time being, being perceived as being capable of producing a bomb but not having one is strategically protective enough. There are holes in the agreement, but it does calls for significantly scaling back Iran’s nuclear program and freezing it at that scaled-back level for several years. Developing a bomb during this period would be a big cheat.\nIran can’t assume that it would get away with a big cheat undetected. And evidence of a big cheat might galvanize other world powers to unite against Iran once again.\nEven if the most cynical view of the Iranian leadership is adopted, the best assumption is that they will limit themselves to little cheats, rather than the big cheat.\nSo, there is a reasonable chance that the deal at least buys some time on the development of an Iranian bomb. That then gets to another precursor question before reaching Schumer’s: Is buying time worthwhile?\nIf you believe there is a sanctions regimen that other world powers would be willing to impose that would be severe enough that Iran would give up its nuclear program entirely, or that it is worth whatever military actions would be necessary to eradicate the program entirely, the answer would be no. If you are doubtful about both of those alternatives, then the answer is yes.\nKicking the can down the road is a bad option unless all the other options are unrealistic or worse.\nOnly after those two precursor questions do you get to Schumer’s: Will the Iranian regime moderate during the course of the agreement?\nSchumer points out that reports of pending change in Iran have persisted for decades, but the ruling mullahs retain a firm hand. Iran, however, has just negotiated and reached a deal with the Great Satan, which is change in itself. The mullahs face mounting religious, cultural, economic and demographic challenges.\nSchumer is right to be skeptical about the prospects of Iranian moderation in the near term. But he is wrong to make that the question on which the entire value of the deal hinges.\nThe possibility of change in Iran is just one more thing that makes buying time worthwhile.\nReach Robb at robert.robb@arizonarepublic.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/my-position-on-the-iran-deal"], "published": "2015-08-14T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T04:23:31.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
