Carly Ledbetter Associate Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/31/2015 01:09 PM EDT | Edited: 5 minutes ago \nAirplane food isn't known for tempting tastebuds, but one restaurant is trying to make you crave the stuff in real life. At \"Fly Kouzina,\" an airplane-themed eatery in Kolkata, India (formerly known as Calcutta), the motto is: \"First class services without actually getting 35,000 feet off the ground.\" \nThough the food isn't necessarily straight off a 747, Fly Kouzina makes you feel like you're sitting in one, what with items like \"jet-fuel\" drinks and \"high-altitude\" courses on the menu. Restaurant-goers can sit in cushy, first-class seats alongside clocks to mark every time zone and airplane-themed art along the walls.
