David Flynn, Editor of Australian Business Traveller Awards commented on the win; “Many business travellers are wary of airport hotels, which are often designed more around frequent flyer convenience than five-star quality. \n\"But the Sofitel LondonHeathrow shows that airport hotels don’t need to be the poor cousin to their big city counterparts. Directly connected to Terminal 5 and with free connections from other terminals, it offers everything you’d expect from a Sofitel flagship including two quality restaurants, a health club and spa, and well-appointed rooms cocooned behind soundproofed windows.” The 605-bedroom Sofitel London Heathrow is only 4 minutes walk away from the terminal via a covered link bridge and takes just 21 minutes to Central London via the Heathrow Express. It also has the largest onsite, undercover parking facilities in the area. The Australian Business Traveller Awards recognise the trend-setters and gamechangers in the highly competitive business travel market across 33 categories including first class suites and business class seats, airport lounges, frequent flyer programs, inflight food and wine, travel technology and more.
