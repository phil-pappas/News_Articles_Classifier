More Rivals steal a march on drifting Starwood \n“We like our bingo business and it is performing well,” said Henry Birch, Rank’s chief executive. “But it is not something we are looking to add to, not least because of the competition issues there.” \nBingo halls at rival Gala also appear to be prospering. The group said in its nine-month trading update, also on Thursday, that gross profits had risen 8 per cent to £50.5m for the third quarter. \nRank posted a 4 per cent increase in overall revenues to £738.3m and a 19 per cent rise in adjusted pre-tax profit to £74.1m. \nAfter the UK government cut duty on bingo from 20 per cent to 10 per cent in the 2014 Budget, Rank spent £3.4m cutting prices, £1.1m on sprucing up its venues and £1.5m on new events and prizes. \nThat led to a 3 per cent rise in customers, to 961,000, even though its Mecca arm closed six bingo halls during the course of the year. “We tried to take action where clubs have been underperforming,” said Mr Birch, but added that the company had no plans for extensive closures. \nMr Birch, previously the head of William Hill’s online business, was brought in to build Rank’s digital business, and he said the company’s digital growth was “ahead of schedule”. Online bingo revenues rose 10.6 per cent but new tax regulations on gaming put a slight dent in operating profits. \nHe has also rolled out 11,000 “Mecca Max” tablets, costing £400 each, to replace paper slips for bingo players. “The tablets deliver four times as much revenue as people playing on paper and the players come more often to the website,” said Mr Birch. \nMecca is now testing whether customers will be happy to use their own smartphones and tablets in its halls. Mr Birch said the trial had shown that customers were happy to play using small screens, despite bingo’s reputation as a pastime for the elderly. \nElsewhere, revenues at Rank’s other main brand, Grosvenor Casinos, rose strongly both on and offline. \nRank raised its full-year dividend 24 per cent to 5.6p, outstripping its 18 per cent growth in earnings per share to 14.6p. \nMr Birch said the company would continue to invest in its estate and online. It is planning to move to a new, more flexible digital gaming platform in March, provided by Newcastle-based Bede Gaming. “We are spending £3m on that this year and £6m on it next year in total cost,” said Mr Birch.
