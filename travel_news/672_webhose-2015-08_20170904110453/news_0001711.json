Anyone that enjoys golfing, hiking and running should take advantage of these cool and comfortable conditions,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun said. \nThe theme of cool and dry air will continue through the end of the week. However, the next weather system will develop across the Midwest on Thursday sending clouds northward throughout the day. \nThe start of the weekend will bring more summerlike warmth and humidity to Philadelphia and New York as afternoon highs will once again flirt with the 80-degree F mark on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:36:42.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
