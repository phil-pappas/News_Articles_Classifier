MONKS AT DAWN\nStand on any of Luang Prabang’s main streets at dawn and you’ll witness a ritual that dates back to the 14th century: the silent procession of barefoot, marigold-robed monks, led by the eldest, the youngest monks trailing, through the misty, darkened streets. Because monks can’t work for a living, they depend on local residents for their daily bread (or rice). Remember to keep a respectful distance and don’t use a flash when taking photos. It’s tempting to buy food to give the monks, but a less intrusive way to interact with them is to visit one of the city’s numerous wats (monasteries) later in the day, where many enjoy practising their English with visitors.\n2. FRENCH CAFES\nCoffee has been part of Lao culture since French colonialists introduced it (Laos was a French protectorate between 1893 and 1953) and Luang Prabang’s French cafes, many in former colonial buildings, are a major attraction. Try Cafe Ban Vat Sene, where you can read French newspapers with your cafe au lait; Le Banneton Bakery Cafe, famous for its crusty baguettes and pastries; or L’Elephant French restaurant. There’s also the non-French Joma Bakery Cafe, which has free wi-fi and a terrace overlooking the Khan river.\nSee joma.boz\n3. TRADITIONAL\nRICE FARMING\n“The Vietnamese plant the rice, the Cambodians watch it grow and the Lao listen to it grow.” So goes an adage about the spiritual calm of Lao people, but you can do more than listen to rice growing at Living Land community-owned organic rice farm, which offers hands-on, half-day experiences that teach you all about this staple of South-East Asia. Depending on the season, you might help plough a field behind a water buffalo or plant rice. There’s also homestay accommodation on the farm.\nSee livinglandlao.com\n4. LUNCH AT DYEN SABAI\nJust getting to this rustic, tree house-style restaurant is an adventure. In the dry season (November-February) you’ll cross the Khan river on a rickety bamboo bridge; at other times of the year, a small boat will take you to the other side. But it’s worth it. Dyen Sabai, open from 8.30am to 11.30pm daily, specialises in traditional Lao dishes such as Mekong river weed, sticky rice and buffalo jerky, served in timber pagodas where you can lounge on cushions on the floor with the restaurant’s resident cats.\nSee dyensabairestaurant.wordpress.com\n5. PHOUSI HILL\nFor a bird’s eye view of Luang Prabang – complete with birds – climb the 328 steps to the top of Phousi Hill, in the centre of town. The best time to go is just before sunset, when the city is bathed in a golden glow. At the top there’s a whitewashed temple, Wat Chomsi, where you can buy offerings, including swallow-like birds in small wicker cages. For 20,000 kip (about $3) you can buy two birds their freedom, and your own future happiness.\n6. NIGHT MARKETS\nOne of the loveliest, and most peaceful, night markets in South-East Asia, Luang Prabang’s handicraft market transforms the city’s main street, Sisavangvong Rd, into a colourful pedestrian plaza between 5pm and 10pm every evening. This is the place to do your souvenir shopping, with handmade silk and cotton textiles such as bags and scarfs rubbing shoulders with Buddha statues, silver jewellery and other trinkets. Haggling is accepted as long as it’s done with respect and good humour; this isn’t Bali or Bangkok.\n7. YOGA BY THE RIVER\nWhat could be more peaceful, more Lao, than a morning yoga session on a timber deck overlooking the Khan river? Luang Prabang Yoga is a community of yoga teachers offering open-air yoga classes at various venues around town, such as Utopia, which has wooden decks and tropical gardens and morphs into a jungle bar-lounge at night. One-hour classes cost 40,000 kip (about $6).\nSee luangprabangyoga.org\n8. LUANG PRABANG\nFILM FESTIVAL\nFor a town with no cinema, just a couple of restaurants that play DVDs for their diners, this film festival, which began six years ago to showcase and support South-East Asian filmmaking, is a big deal. It’s also a simple, open-air affair: screens and blue plastic chairs are set up in the grounds of five-star hotels, on garden lawns and in the main square, and all screenings are free, with seating on a first-come, first-served basis. This year’s festival is from December 5-9.\nSee lpfilmfest.org\n9. UXO VISITOR CENTRE\nLaos is the most heavily bombed country per capita in history, thanks to more than half a million US bombing raids between 1964 and 1973, and unexploded ordnance (UXO) continues to kill civilians every year. This tragic story is explained in moving detail at the UXO Visitor Centre, situated behind the Chou Anouvong monument and open 8am-4pm (free entry), particularly the efforts to clear landmines across the country, which at the current rate will be going on for centuries.\nSee uxolao.gov.la\n10. PAK OU CAVES\nTwenty-five kilometres up the Mekong, a two-hour trip from Luang Prabang by long tail speedboat, is a cathedral-like natural temple bursting with Buddhas. There are almost 4000 statues in two ancient caves, ranging from thimble-sized statues to giant golden Buddhas that almost touch the ceiling.\nSee greendiscoverylaos.com\nGO2\nLAOS\nGETTING THERE\nSeveral airlines, such as Qantas and Thai Airways codesharing with Lao Airlines, fly from Sydney to Luang Prabang via Bangkok. You can get a 30-day tourist visa on arrival at Luang Prabang airport for $US30 (payable in US dollars).\nSee qantas.com.au , thaiairways.com.au\nSTAYING THERE\nBurasari Heritage, which opened in 2012, is a beautifully restored traditional timber house on the banks of the river Khan, with rooms from $US77 a night including breakfast and complimentary airport transfers, minibar and Wi-Fi.\nSee www.burasariheritage.com\nMORE\nvisit-laos.com , tourismluangprabang.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T13:27:53.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
