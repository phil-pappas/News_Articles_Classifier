It handles planes that fly to European destinations such as Amsterdam, Dublin, Madrid and Florence. \nIt welcomed a record 3.6 million passengers last year, up 8% on 2013. \nHowever, expansion could be difficult. London Mayor Boris Johnson cited noise concerns when he blocked planning permission to increase the size of the site to accommodate 6 million passengers. The airport is awaiting the result of an appeal against that decision. \nIt is the 15th busiest airport in the UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:33:31.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
