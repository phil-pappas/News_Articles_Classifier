Diaran Kone. 'We freed the four hostages. But unfortunately we also found three bodies at the site.' \nA spokeswoman for Mali's UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA said four UN contractors two from South Africa along with a Russian and a Ukrainian had been freed in the pre-dawn raid by security forces. 'At no point were they discovered by the terrorists in the hotel. They were hiding' Radhia Achouri said adding that the mission was verifying whether any other MINUSMA personnel were present inside the hotel. \nThree hostages died during the ordeal Malian government spokesman Choguel Kokala Maiga said. A Malian military spokesman said they were from South Africa Russia and Ukraine. \nSouth Africa's Foreign Ministry confirmed that two of its citizens were safe while a 38-year-old Pretoria resident working for an aviation company contracted with MINUSMA had died. \nFive soldiers and four gunmen including one who officials earlier said was strapped with explosives were also killed he said. \nUkraine and Russia had previously confirmed that their citizens were among the hostages. Russian news agencies citing a press attache at Moscow's embassy in Mali said a Russian hostage employed by the airline UTair was among those freed on Saturday. \nSeven suspects have been arrested in connection with the attack according to a government statement released late on Friday. \nA 2013 French-led military operation drove back fighters who had taken advantage of an ethnic Tuareg rebellion and a military coup to seize territory in the north a year earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T00:21:30.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
