(AP) â€” As the summer tourist season begins to wind down, the numbers show it's been another good year for South Carolina's $18 billion tourism industry.\nFigures posted by the state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism show that through the first half of 2015, room occupancy and average room rates were both up in the state. Meanwhile, revenue per available room, a key indicator of industry health, was up more than 8 percent over last year.\nThe figures were compiled by STR, Inc., a company that tracks tourism trends.\nThe average room rate in South Carolina in June was $122, about a dollar more than the national average.\nSTR is forecasting modest growth in room occupancy in South Carolina through the end of the summer.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T01:50:05.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
