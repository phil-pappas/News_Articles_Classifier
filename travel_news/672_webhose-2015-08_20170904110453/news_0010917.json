Last week, satellite images revealed that construction had been completed on a series of five private aircraft runways next to a few of the leader’s palaces. \"These runways are located near Kim family compounds - sometimes within the security perimeters - and next to private train stations that were used by Kim Jong Il” Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the US-Korea Institute at John Hopkins University in Washington told Reuters . One of them includes a 500-metre airstrip adjacent to a private palace in the industrial port city of Wonsan, which Mr Kim had previously ordered to be made into a “world class” tourist beach resort town . The Kim family also has a fortified compound on Wonsan bay and it has long been a popular retreat for the ruling family. The runway is a few 100 metres from the Songdowon Children's Camp, a children's holiday camp and a sandy beach for tourists.

The latest landing strip appeared to have been built over the helipad where Mr Kim greeted the former US basketball player Dennis Rodman during his visit in 2013. The former NBA (National Basketball Association) star described the life of Mr Kim, who he referred to as a “good friend” at the time, as a “seven-star” party of endless cocktails and jet-skis following a week spent on the leader’s private island. \"It's [the island] like going to Hawaii or Ibiza, but he's the only one that lives there,\" Mr Rodman said.

Earlier that year, the North Korean leader was suspected to have used a 95 foot- luxury yacht to travel the country on a 10-day tour of the east coast, according to NK News. The vessel, identified as likely to be a Princess 95MY, was spotted during a visit to a fishery station covered by state media. A photograph released by state news agency North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) showed Mr Kim and his generals walking along the docks during an inspection and behind them was a glimpse of the yacht.

The 98MY model of the yacht, which was an updated version of the 95MY, was estimated to cost more than £5.6 million at the time. The Great Successor’s affinity for a luxury lifestyle was displayed earlier this year in a series of photographs released by KCNA which showed him inside his luxury private jet in Pyongyang before descending to the ground to monitor the latest developments for a major building project in the city. The jet is a converted Soviet-era Ilyushin IL-62 named \"Chammae-1\" after a native species of hawk, according to Reuters, where the leader is seen sitting in a plush white leather sofa observing documents over a shiny rosewood desk with a crystal ashtray, while enjoying aerial views from the plane.

The estimated £21 million ski resort, which features 70 miles of multi-level ski runs, a hotel, a heliport and cable cars, was visited by Mr Kim in late 2013 who spent New Year’s Eve there and described “with great satisfaction\" that everything was \"impeccable\".

Horse riding is said to be another favourite pastime of Mr Kim, who is also said to be a natural sailor, according to a biographical manual issued to teachers in North Korea earlier this year to be taught to children as part of their school curriculum.

While some of the country's nearly 24 million people might be lacking food, shelter and other basic necessities, the North Korean leader's regime was found to have had an increase in imports of musical instruments, cosmetics, handbags, leather products, watches and cars made in Japan and China, according to a report submitted to the South Korean parliament in 2013 . Other purchases that were revealed included bottles of high-end alcohol costing the state $30 million (£20 million), electronic goods costing $37 million and luxury watches costing a further $8.2 million.
