While princesses and queens feature prominently in the books and films my daughter favours, they don’t actually do much, other than wear voluminous dresses and impractical footwear, and live Happily Ever After. \nThis summer’s exhibition ‘A Royal Welcome’ answers my daughter’s question in a variety of ways that are accessible to people of all different ages. \nDisplays in the State rooms offer a behind-the-scenes look how the palace prepares to receive guests – whether for State visits, receptions, investitures or private audiences. \nChocolates fit for a Queen: sadly, the price of admission does not include a tasting menu, though there are plenty of cookbooks available in the gift shop Photo: Geoff Pugh/The Telegraph \nFrom the design of the Queen’s dresses to the ingredients chosen for a State banquet, it is the most formal of life that is on display here. \nGuests can walk for the first time ever in the footsteps of visiting dignitaries, entering the State rooms through the \"Grand Entrance\". This prompted a lively discussion with my children of what an ambassador was, and why he or she might want to see the Queen. \nSome of the Queen's dresses and coats worn on official occaions are on display, along with designs and materials Photo: Geoff Pugh/The Telegraph \nWhile all of our fellow visitors walked silently and purposefully through the palace hooked up to audio tours, when supervising young children, the wearing of headphones isn’t practical. \n• 50 great days out in the UK \nIn fact, skipping the audio tour may not be a bad idea: I’d rather look at the omni-gilded splendour around me than watch the Prince of Wales on a tiny hand-held television screen. And in any event, one of the joys of visiting Buckingham Palace is that the multi-lingual summer staff are so impeccably trained that my children and I got a top-class tour by just talking to people. How retro. \nOfficial gifts to the Queen, including this sculpture from Mexico, are on display Photo: Geoff Pugh/The Telegraph \nIn each room we entered, and each bend in the garden path, smartly dressed guards popped up at all the right moments to lead my children in discovering tantalising tidbits of information on royal life: could they find the Queen’s secret door that leads from the State rooms into her private apartment? Hint: it's reflective. \nCould they find the gate to the island housing the hives that provide the palace with its honey? Only three people have the key to unlock it. The guards' spontaneous mini-treasure hunts kept even my two-year-old entertained. \n• London city break guide \nFollowing last summer’s excellent \"Royal Childhood\" exhibition, the Palace has continued to offer young visitors an activity space, in the form of the family pavilion overlooking the garden. There, my children raided the dressing-up box and, transformed into princesses and guards, they practiced setting the table with five different glasses for each place, read stories from the well-curated library, coloured images of formal dresses, and generally let off steam. \nWhile tickets aren’t cheap (£20.50 for an adult, £11.80 for under-17s, free for children aged five and under ), if you buy your ticket directly from the Palace, you are entitled to free re-admission for the next year. \nMy children listed the Queen's secret door and the family pavilion as their favourite aspects of our visit to Buckingham Palace. For me, though, as a lesson in government, history and art, a family visit to Buckingham Palace is hard to beat.
