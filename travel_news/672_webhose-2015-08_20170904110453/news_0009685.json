Millions of Americans are planning vacations in record numbers for the end of summer. This trend has led Pristine Agency to anticipate that the number of travelers will continue to increase as the end of summer approaches.\nExperts in the travel industry have seen a distinct rise in the number of travelers in 2015. Lower gas prices, an improved economy and a strong U.S. dollar, have all led to a spike in the number of Americans enjoying a vacation this summer to destinations throughout the U.S. Now, as the end of August approaches, these already lower prices are dropping even lower, and more and more Americans are heading out to explore top destinations such as Las Vegas , Cancun and London , for less.\nThis trend is expected to continue through the month of August and through the end of September, peaking during the Labor Day holiday with over 30 to 37 million expected during the holiday weekend alone. While predictions as to the exact number of Americans expected to travel during this weekend has not yet been released, past years have indicated that an increase is to be expected. Factor in the latest gas prices, which are still below the average for this period, and the likelihood that this prediction is correct, is even greater.\nThose planning on traveling during the end of summer should expect to see many benefits to travel this time of the year. Lower prices on accommodations, merchandise and an easier time booking, are just a few of the benefits of traveling during the end of summer season. While the increase of tourists may drive up the cost in some areas for travel, overall reduced numbers from peak summer travel months, will still make this time of the year a much more affordable and less crowded time of year to travel.\nPristine Agency is a members-only travel service located in Henderson, Nevada , and offering members access to a wide array of travel benefits to destinations worldwide.\nThis press release was issued through 24-7PressRelease.com.
