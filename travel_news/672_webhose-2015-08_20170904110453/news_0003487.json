Hyejung Yang, Incentive and Exhibitions Team, Korea Tourism Organisation commented on her experience at the show; “We have had a lot of business from Trade Buyers and Hosted Buyers attending the show. We have attended ibtm china for the last 5 years and it is an important part of our marketing strategy. Following last years CIBTM we secured an incentive tour for 15,000 corporates. This year we have confirmed an incentive group of 8,000 international delegates with a U.S. corporate company.” Helen Zhang, Business Events Manager Greater China, New Zealand Tourism said, “This is our third year at ibtm china and yesterday we received around 15 business leads, which was very productive. It is important that we continue to exhibit here as it allows us to educate people about New Zealand’s potential in this sector and now buyers are coming to our stand asking about particular cities for hosting meetings, which is a great trend that started here.” Grace Crispus-Shanmugam, Executive Assistant to Group CEO, Clarius Group (Australia) who attended as an international Hosted Buyer commented, “This has been a great show for me and has definitely been worthwhile. I have found some suppliers here that I am definitely interested in using going forward. The show helps me learn more about the industry and has given me some great new ideas. It has been a good use of my time out of the office and I have found it the most productive show to date.” Supporting this, Ms. Wang Yue, Vice Chairman of Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Developments commented during the official ibtm china press conference, “ibtm china has grown into Asia’s largest and most mature international exhibition dedicated to the convention, exhibition and incentive industries over the past decade, offering a solid platform for Beijing’s and even China’s tourism to expand external communication, intensify collaboration, promote development and achieve a win-win result.” Cici Chen, Senior Project Manager, ibtm china concludes, “This has been a great year for us. We introduced our mutually matched appointment system for the first time, which was very well received. This matched appointments according to both exhibitor and buyer preferences, ensuring more relevant appointments and better ROI. “The feedback we have obtained to date really does validate the fact that quality counts for everything when it comes to delivering a world class exhibition. CIBTM is a platform dedicated to driving the industry forward in the region and as a team, we are committed to developing the show further through research and strategic partnerships and we look forward to welcoming you next year.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T12:17:11.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
