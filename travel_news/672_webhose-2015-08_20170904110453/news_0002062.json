One such product that I recently came across during my search for interesting travel product/services is BOGO Cards, a prepaid travel card offered by Trip Factory. These travel cards take away two of the biggest headaches of holiday planning, one dates and the second costs. BOGO Cards is quite a handy travel product that offers you a holiday with flight tickets and 3 star hotel booking to many destinations both domestic and international. Once you buy it, you can use it anytime you want in the next 365 days (with the exception of some peak tourist seasons). What this means is that irrespective of whether the flight or hotels become more expensive, your cost is fixed. All you have to do is choose your holiday dates at least 14 days before and that’s it, you can enjoy your holiday at the seriously low price that you had bought your bogo card at and not at the current prices. Your flights are taken care for you. Your hotel bookings are taken care for you. Even your breakfast is taken care of. All you have to do is arrange last mile commute and decide which attraction or restaurant you want to visit or which activity you want to indulge in and you have your own special holiday all planned out. Sounds interesting right? Let me explain this in detail with an example: Let’s assume that you are based out of Delhi or even if you are not, you are planning to travel from Delhi. Bogo cards allows you to choose from a variety of destinations both domestic and international. Under domestic trips, you can choose from Jammu, Lucknow, Bangalore, Kolkata, Mumbai, Srinagar, Goa or Kochi and under international, you can choose from Bangkok, Dubai or Singapore. These are the options that are available today and I am sure they will change with time. Bogo Cards – What is it? Now, say for example, you are interested in a short holiday to Goa, but don’t know when you want to go. All you have to do is select the Goa holiday Bogo card to see if it can interest you. You find out that this card is valid for 4 days and 3 nights in Goa. In the card, they mention that you would be flying either with Jet Airways or Go Air, who happen to be their airline partners for this holiday. There are 3 hotels where you might be put up. Right now, the options are 2 star or 3 star. You can see the hotel names, tripadvisor ratings, pictures, location and other details. The cost is INR 10,999 per person if you opt for twin sharing or INR 11,999 per person for single sharing. You can see the available dates (this is important to check as some dates might be holidays or already sold out). You can also see possible upgrade options for hotels in case you wish to upgrade yourself to a 4 star or 5 star hotel. However, you do have to pay the difference in cost, if you opt to upgrade. Now, let’s assume that you like what this Bogo card offers and you end up buying it at the current price point. You will get a unique card number that you can redeem whenever you plan on taking your holiday. If there are 2 of you traveling, you should buy 2 cards on twin sharing or if you are traveling alone, you buy one card on single sharing. BOGO Cards – How do I redeem it for my holiday? Time has gone by after you purchased your Bogo card, but now, you wish to use it to book your holiday to Goa. All you would to have to do now is redeem your Bogo card by choosing your location of departure and the destination you wish to visit. Once you do that, you will get to select your hotel. For certain 2 or 3 star hotels, you will not need to pay more, but if you wish to upgrade yourself to a 5 star hotel to make your holiday luxurious, you just have to pay the difference. At this juncture, you can see the hotel details, date availability, photos of the room and the property, What’s included and more.The next step is for you to choose your dates, add additional nights, check your flight details (make changes to it if necessary), check the final price, pay the difference and get ready to pack your bags for your holiday to Goa.

This includes flights and hotels. 2) Flexibility to travel any time of the year (provided dates are available) with just a 14 day lead time. 3) Ability to upgrade to a hotel of superior class for an additional cost. 4) Ability to extend holiday duration over and above the duration mentioned on your Bogo card for an additional cost. 5) Ability to transfer the card to any person (friend or family). 6) Easy cancellation options.
