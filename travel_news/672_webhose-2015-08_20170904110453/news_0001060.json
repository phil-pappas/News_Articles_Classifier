However, when I embarked on a road trip with two of my good friends, we discovered that it was the unexpected that delighted us the most; inexplicably drawing us to stops like Oxford’s Giant Blueberry and Shediac’s Lobster.\nOur 1,000-km round-trip was designed to bring us up the coast of Nova Scotia, all the way to the north shore of New Brunswick. Settling into our rental Nissan, we swung by the Halifax harbour to commemorate the beginning of our drive with a snap of a local landmark—the Big Wave. Familiar with the Wave, and its odd resemblance to a giant blue tongue, we climbed to the top, just like a generation of Haligonians. Happy with our first picture, and our cups of locally roasted Italian coffee from Pavia, it was time to hit the road.\nStill energetic after driving a mere 70km north on Highway 102, we found the perfect excuse for our first pit stop: an (apparently) slightly larger than life-sized Mastodon. “Marvin” stands atop Mastodon Ridge, celebrating the discovery of his fossils in the nearby National Gypsum Quarry. Colourful and interactive signs heralded Stewiacke’s other claim to fame—the town is situated exactly halfway between the Equator and the North Pole. My inner child beamed at the discoveries.\nOver a slice of rustic fish pie from Masstown Market, located just past Truro, we began to appreciate the uniquely North American experience of the “road trip.” Free of timetables, our endless web of highways and friendly continent revives our long-dormant pioneer instincts. Even in our little rental car, we began wondering what we might discover over the next rocky and pine-covered hill.\nFighting off a mild case of highway hypnosis on the Trans-Canada, the road trip gods presented a cure: a Giant Blueberry. Welcoming visitors to Oxford, the Wild Blueberry Capital of Canada, we learned that the town processes over three million pounds of berries per day during peak season. It was then we realized that these oversized statues are more than just amusing oddities. They tend to summarize a region, advertising what is most important locally, in the universal language of plaster and paint.\nThrilled to discover that the cavalcade of attractions continued across the provincial boarder into New Brunswick, we made a beeline to the World’s Largest Lobster (who would stop for the second largest?). Framed by an arm of the Shediac Harbour, it was easy to take a beautiful, and somewhat comical, snapshot. And we weren’t alone. Even in the off-season, we actually had to wait our turn.\nAs we neared Grand-Anse, a lighthouse painted like the Acadian flag, heralded one final stop that we couldn’t afford to miss. Pretending to swim inside an enormous Lobster Trap, like doomed crustaceans, we couldn’t help but wonder, why people love roadside attractions so much. Is it the inherent humour? The unexpected discovery? Or is it just a relief to get out of the car after staring at kilometers of “Moose Warning” signs?\nAfter reviewing our collection of photographs, and chewing on a few strands of Acadian “squeaky” cheese, we figured it out: a photograph with a roadside attraction, whether in the Canadian Maritimes or elsewhere, is the equivalent to a stamp in your passport. It’s a way to show your friends and family that you not only took the road less travelled, but also enjoyed the journey.\nNova Scotia and New Brunswick have an abundance of these unique, oversized attractions, interspersed between some of the Maritime’s most beautiful scenery. This is by no means an exhaustive list. We missed out on Cape Breton’s fiddle, the 12m tall, mythological native hero “Glooscap,” and many more.\nOften, it’s the little things in life that you treasure, but as a road trip across two of Canada’s Maritime provinces proved, sometimes it’s actually the big things.\nIf You Go\nAlexandra Kopstals is an Aurora-based travel writer.

If you plan on stopping like we did, you’d better budget 9 hours. Bring an old-fashioned paper map, as cell service can be little unreliable. If you have extra time, it’s worth the drive to Sydney, NS for Cape Breton’s stunning scenery, and a picture with the World’s Largest Fiddle.\nPrivate paradise in British Columbia", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:40:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
