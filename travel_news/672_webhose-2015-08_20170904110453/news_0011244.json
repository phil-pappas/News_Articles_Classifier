That would describe Pelion, the region around the spur of land that pokes out of the eastern mainland between the Aegean and the Pagasetic Gulf that makes up the eastern half of Magnesia. Take a flight to the nearest airport, Nea Anchialos, near the city of Volos, jump in a car and explore its riches. Some rate it as Greece’s most beautiful region and it certainly has some striking contrasts: a rugged spine swathed in olives and pines climbing towards a lofty mountain as well as some fantastic beaches. The peninsula is dominated by Mount Pelion, below which dozens of little villages fan out, apparently unchanged for centuries and linked by cobbled paths. At more than 5,300ft, the mountain offers some of Greece’s best skiing. In summer it’s a grand hike. Lofty: the village of Makrinitsa onthe slopes of Mt. Pelion Photo: Region of Magnesia There’s a delightful, nostalgic narrow gauge steam train nicknamed Smudgy (or Moutzouris) a few miles south. It departs from Ano Lehonia (ample parking), crossing six gorges as it winds up the mountain to the village of Milies. Up there you’ll find a variety of adventure activities including canoeing and more great hiking. According to Greek mythology, Mount Pelion was the home of the mythical centaurs, half man-half horse, and for centuries the area has boasted a proud equine tradition. Riding holidays and tours are popular, particularly in the quiet, rural spot around Argalasti using the trails between the villages and even descending to the coast. The most charming concentration of traditional communities lies to the north at the main gateway to the region, including Agios Dimitrios a particularly lovely mountain village and, a little to the south, Tsagarada one of the oldest villages in the area. The regional capital and biggest city for miles is Volos, a well-heeled port at the top of the Pagasetic Gulf. The city is stocked with some grand buildings - notably the neoclassical Conservatory - an impressive railway station and a fine waterside park. Its smart waterfront is filled with restaurants and bars or tsipouradika, serving the popular local spirit tsipouro (one of Greece's most popular drinks) and little tapas-style delicacies (mezes). Unsurprisingly, the locally caught seafood is delicious. There are some marvellous beaches and stretches of coastline on both sides of the peninsula There’s a strong cultural scene here, a well-stocked archaeological museum, the Athanasakeion, and one of the oldest cinemas in Greece, the Achilleion. In the west, by the port terminal you’ll find a full-scale replica of the Argo, the mythical ship which left from the region (or more accurately Iolcus, the city’s ancient forerunner) carrying Jason on his quest for the Golden Fleece. A little way out of the city lie two important Neolithic settlements at Dimini and Sesklo. There are some truly marvellous beaches and stretches of coastline to be found on both sides of the peninsula. Dropping down from Mt Pelion brings you to the most renowned in the area, Mylopotamos, where two arches have been carved out of the rocks by the sea. A little to the north you’ll find Damouchari, a small beach with white and pink pebbles where scenes for Mama Mia! were shot and, beyond that, Agios Ioannis, another popular resort. Off the Aegean shore you’ll find the Sporades, a clutch of islands that includes Skiathos, Alonisos and Skopelos. Over on the gulf Kala Nera is a beautiful coastal settlement and a little to the south there’s another popular resort at Afissos. Pelion has a bit of everything and it will surprise many, even seasoned Greek travellers. • Read more about Greek travel at Holidays in Greece", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T20:55:29.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
