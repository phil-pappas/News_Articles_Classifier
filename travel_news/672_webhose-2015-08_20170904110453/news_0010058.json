Expectations of punctuality, along with other bothersome details of ordinary life, simply don't exist at Ashford Castle, named hotel of the year by Virtuoso, a network of international travel agents, in August. This is a world which conforms to the desires and quirks of its residents (no one is a guest here), not the other way around. It is a hallmark of exceptional service - and it's the service here that comes as the biggest surprise. In such a place – a five-star hotel housed in a 13 th century castle on a 140ha country estate in western Ireland – it's not unreasonable to fear the 150 formally dressed staff will be snooty and intimidating. But no. Consistently attentive, yet never intrusive, no request is ever a problem. \"Of course,\" is the standard response. Ashford has been accepting guests for 80 years, among them royalty, presidents, the celebrities of the day (Fred Astaire, Brad Pitt) and legions of the anonymous but wealthy. And then there's me, a weary and somewhat scruffy Kiwi (accompanied by an equally weary and scruffy Australian). When we check in hours beyond the expected time (late again) we receive a welcome befitting Brad and Angelina but somehow not at all showy or ingratiating. It's hard to imagine feeling at home in such sumptuous surroundings, yet I do almost immediately, due largely to the people who work there. If the warmth of the staff isn't genuine, they are outstanding actors. \nThe entrance hall at Ashford Castle. \nAshford, one of the oldest castles in Ireland, sprawls on the banks of the country's second largest lake, Lough Corrib, 42kms northeast of Galway in County Mayo. \nRecently reopened after a 67m euro (NZ$144m) renovation, it is extravagance writ large, from the dozens of red roses which grace the vaulted entrance hall to the number of Venetian glass chandeliers (there are at least 12 in the Dining Room alone). \nThere are acres of richly-hued carpet and ornate dark wood panelling, and the castle is crammed with original art, mostly paintings depicting wildlife, birds and dogs (in my suite alone there are 12 paintings of dogs and a dozen of birds). All the amenities you would expect of such a grand historic residence are here – drawing room, billiard room, library and cigar terrace – along with sensitively incorporated additions including a 32-seat cinema, a spa, gym and pool, and a children's games room (there's also a Lego Room Service menu, should the little darlings require it). There are two bars and three restaurants, including Cullens at the Dungeon, which serves bistro-style fare and has a more informal ambience than the George V Dining Room. The latter, built in honour of a visit by the Prince of Wales in 1906 before he ascended the English throne, offers dining at its finest. The focus at Cullens, on the castle's lower ground floor, is on traditional Irish cuisine. Which explains the five side dishes on the seasonal menu - all potato, in various guises. There's beef and Guinness stew, potted prawns, pies and black forest gateau. It's as hearty as hell and utterly delicious. Upstairs in the George Dining Room it's silver service all the way, even at breakfast. The humble poached egg you might order after overdosing on exquisite (but rather rich) food there the night before is served with the triumphant removal of an enormous silver dome. Ashford has 68 guest rooms and 14 staterooms and suites, all refurbished during the recent renovation with antiques, bespoke carpets, marble bathrooms and all that, in keeping with the ambience of the castle. My master suite, housed over two levels in its very own turret, is more than double the size of my Auckland apartment. In fact, the suite is superior in every conceivable way; it has three bathrooms and maids in frilled caps and aprons, for a start. The scale of it all lends a dreamlike quality. No wonder a previous guest, the actor Richard E. Grant, described Ashford as \"selling the Irish dream to Americans\". Indeed, most of the guests are Americans who know about Ashford from the film The Quiet Man , which was filmed here in 1951. \nThe George V Dining Room. \nThen there's the estate itself. After entering through a stone archway, the road winds gently through woodland and down to the lake, with the gobsmacking grandeur of the castle looming up before it. \nGuests are free to roam the property's gardens, forests and paddocks laced with dry stone walls. \nThe property is home to Ireland's oldest falconry school, a nine-hole golf course, an equestrian centre, two tennis courts, and a fishing centre (the lake is one of the best in the country for trout and salmon fishing). \nIn keeping with the preferences of Irish kings past, there are also two resident Irish wolfhounds. Ad Feedback \nBeyond the estate is the village of Cong, all tiny terraced houses and tinier country lanes – it is a working rural area after all (just pray you don't encounter a tractor). \nThe shell of the village's 12 th century Augustinian abbey – where the last high king of Ireland, Rory O'Connor, lived out his final years – remains and has been partially restored. \nA forest recreation area which was once part of the Guinness family estate (the stout barons owned Ashford Castle for more than a century until 1939) is also worth exploring. \nIt has walking trails and historic buildings, including a small 16 th century monks' fishing house, built partly over the Cong River on a platform of stones. \nThe medieval monks, for whom fish was a dietary staple, could drop their lines through a trapdoor in the floor while staying warm beside the fire inside. \nTake a moment to sit where the monks once did and watch the river below. \nChances are you'll soon see salmon and trout drift by – more than a meal, in any century. \nFact file \nGETTING THERE Emirates flies three A380 aircraft from Auckland and a Boeing 777 aircraft from Christchurch to their hub in Dubai every day.
