The former Grand Millennium Sukhumvit Bangkok will rebrand to become the third Pullman in the ‘City of Angels’ and adds 325 spacious and beautifully designed rooms to the region’s most dynamic upscale hotel brand. \n“The Pullman Bangkok Grande Sukhumvit is a terrific addition to the network, providing stylish, upscale accommodation designed for today’s sophisticated traveller,” said Michael Issenberg, Chairman and CEO AccorHotels Asia Pacific. “The hotel boasts an unbeatable location, outstanding meeting facilities and modern restaurants that make it popular not only with guests but with Bangkok locals. “Bangkok holds a special place in the history of the Pullman brand as we opened our first Pullman there – the Pullman Bangkok King Power back in 2008. To add our third Pullman in Bangkok – at a time when the brand has over 55 hotels in the region - is testament to how well the brand has been embraced by travellers and owners alike over the years.” The Pullman brand has really found its place in the hotel sector, striking the perfect balance between performance and enjoyment, business and leisure, with a focus on keeping guests connected. The hotel features a highly visible sail-shaped glass façade, a range of room styles from deluxe rooms to executive suites and a presidential suite as well as 2 restaurants, a deli lounge, a cocktail bar, outdoor pool, well-equipped gym and extensive spa. There are great facilities for functions or celebrations, with ten meeting rooms including a pillarless grand ballroom for up to 500 guests. In Asia Pacific alone, Pullman has a strong pipeline of over 40 hotels in the next few years and will continue to expand aggressively. Pullman is now the largest five-star hotel brand in Australia and the fastest-growing AccorHotels brand in China, reflecting its popularity in the region. Sukhumvit is one of Bangkok’s most famous streets and also the longest road in Thailand. The Pullman’s position at Asoke (Soi 21) puts it right in the centre of the best bars and restaurants, nightlife, transport hubs and shopping. It is just moments from Asoke BTS, Sukhumvit MRT and the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre, making it perfect for both business and leisure travellers. As part of the rebranding the hotel will build on its already outstanding guest experience by improving its facilities.
