THAI has set up a special check-in counter at Row B 7-8 and will grant injured passengers an upgrade to Royal Silk Class or Royal Silk Class (if space is available). The passengers will be assisted by staff through all formalities at Suvarnabhumi Airport, then will be escorted to the Royal Orchid Lounge and to the aircraft. Ground customer service staff will coordinate with the cabin crew to look after passengers throughout the flight. Upon arrival at the final destination, the station manager will provide assistance to passengers. THAI has also coordinated with the Airline Operators Committee (AOC) to provide similar assistance to affected passengers holding airline tickets from other carriers. Relatives of affected passengers who wish to travel to visit injured family members receiving medical care at various hospitals in Bangkok are offered tickets to fly with THAI at a special fare. \nDue to this situation, THAI has waived the fee and surcharge for transporting the deceased back to their homeland. Family members may contact the Companyâ€™s Customer Services Department at THAI Cargo, Suvarnabhumi Airport, Tel. 02-137-4940 to 2. \nAfter the Company issued a flight change waiver for passengers unable to take the return flight, effective 18th August 2015, passengers requested flight changes at a slightly higher rate of approximately 20 percent per day. \nTHAI is in close coordination with the Ministry of Tourism and Sports to look after those affected by the situation, especially foreigners, in the hopes that they will understand and place confidence in the Thai Government and units in charge of the situation. Strict safety standards will be implemented in order to reassure tourists that Thailand is safe to travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T19:12:03.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
