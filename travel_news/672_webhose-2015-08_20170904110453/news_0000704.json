A key date in the Islamic calendar, Eid Ul Adha marks the end of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and is a time for Muslims to give thanks for Allah’s blessings. The annual holiday occurs in September or October and each year the Maldivian Government chooses one island to host the country’s main celebration of the festival. Eid Ul Adha falls on 23 September this year, and bespoke holiday specialist Experience Travel Group can organise trips for inquisitive visitors to experience the Maldives’ unique Eid Kulhivaru festivities first-hand.
