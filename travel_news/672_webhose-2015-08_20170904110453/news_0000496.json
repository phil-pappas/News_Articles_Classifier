Some of the language schools are being impacted where they are retrenching people. The oil and gas…are really suffering so many of them are halving in size or retrenching staff.”\nWinde says the long term spin-offs from all of this could bring the tourism industry to its knees.\n“Obviously from a brand point of view we are going to lose many, many tourists because it has become difficult to come here. More importantly it’s even more difficult to come here if you have children. The major brand impact over time is that we are going to be seen as not a family friendly destination, so don’t come and visit us if you have a family.”\nThe two areas of concern are the requirements for all children younger than 18 years to be in possession of an unabridged birth certificate when travelling in and out of the country.\nThe other requires tourists to now appear in person during visa application processes in order to obtain a biometric visa.\nDutch national, Hermam Klok, almost had to cancel his annual family holiday to Cape Town because he didn’t have an unabridged birth certificate for his four-year old son.\n“We had a bit of difficulty when we entered the country. We wanted to get a visa from them. In previous years it wasn’t a problem, but now they said no you need a birth certificate. We couldn’t find both when we were at home in the Netherlands, but we had our marriage book which also the children are written into.”\nFilipe Lobo from Mozambique says even though his family didn’t encounter problems, many would-be visitors have been dissuaded from coming to South Africa because of red-tape.\nGovernment is considering reviewing the controversial new visa regulations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:41:41.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
