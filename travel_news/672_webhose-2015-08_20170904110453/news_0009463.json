Suggestions have included everything from an online member’s portal on the ABPCO website to higher level speakers at events. We have listened and we are now in the process of either delivering or acting upon the feedback.”\n“It is imperative we listen to our members. Without our members and their hard work, ABPCO would not be the influence it is within the industry. These are exciting times ahead for ABPCO and all those associated.”\nSource:-ABPCO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:48:46.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
