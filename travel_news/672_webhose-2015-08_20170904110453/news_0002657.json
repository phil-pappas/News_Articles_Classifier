Last updated 10:30, August 16 2015 Supplied \nJim Park in Pulau, where he teaches a class of just five students. \nEducation officer Jim Park is enjoying the blissful quiet of Pitcairn Island, overseeing education for the locals. \nWhat inspired your move and how long have you been there? \nAfter a long career in education and having taught in schools in the Middle East, Japan and Hong Kong, I was looking for a final overseas teaching experience with a bit of adventure. I came to Pitcairn Island at the beginning of 2014. What do you do there? I teach the children at Pulau School, who range in age from five to 14. I'm responsible for everything associated with the school and the children's education. What are the greatest advantages of living there? The island life is very quiet, peaceful and relaxing because you're surrounded by nature. It's less stressful, especially in light of the consequences of the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, where I normally live. Disadvantages? The main challenge is the isolation. You also have to plan well because the supply ship, the Claymore 11, comes only once every three months. How expensive is it compared to New Zealand? The prices for food are similar to New Zealand. As for day-to-day living costs, it is a lot cheaper as there isn't a lot to spend your money on. Supplied \nThe view from the top of Pitcairn Island. \nWhat do you do in your spare time? \nI walk the trails. I'm up to walk number 75, with the goal of 100 walks before I leave at the end of the year. Last year I did a lot of writing and this year I have dabbled in sketching and water colours of the natural environment. I can visit the cruise ships for the day when they visit the island. The fishing is abundant and a trip can be arranged with the locals, who sometimes have a fry up for everyone down at Ship's Landing. What is the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? \nBreadfruit, cassava chips and pilau. I enjoy the local farfay and nanwee fish, which are always fresh and very tasty. Easiest way to get around? Tell us your Expat Tale Share your stories, photos and videos. \nThe island itself is a volcanic outcrop with a rugged coastline and rocky cliffs, with one small sandy beach called Down Rope. The trails are steep so quad bikes are used as work horses and to get around. The longboats are used to ferry goods and visitors to and from the anchored vessels that visit the island during cruise ship season. What's the shopping like? \nThe local store is open three times a week for about an hour to buy life's necessities and you can order things from the cruise ships. Best after-dark activity? \nWith a small population, you have to be self-reliant for entertainment. I enjoy reading and I've watched many movies as well as using the internet to keep in contact with the outside world. The island also has a link with an Australian television news channel. \nBest time of year to visit? Ad Feedback \nIf you want blue skies and dryness then February/ March. October/November is another option as it is starting to get warmer by then. This is also when the island is busy with visiting cruise ships and yachts. You can arrange a three to 10-day homestay experience with one of the local families or opt for self-catering accommodation. What are the top three things you would recommend for visitors? A visit to the Gods, Christian's Cave and Down Rope where you can see petroglyphs made by the ancient Polynesians. Ship's Landing, St Paul's and Tedside where an alternative harbour is currently under construction. Visitors between August and September might be lucky enough to see humpback whales and their calves. Besides family and friends, what do you miss most about home? I miss the opportunity to walk down the road for a cappuccino and a muffin, and a visit to the local bar for a beer and a chat about what's happening in the world of sport. I miss looking at the snow-capped Southern Alps and being able to play a round of golf at my local club. How easy is it to get back to New Zealand? \nIt is an adventure in itself getting back. After a short longboat trip to the Claymore 11, I have a two-day open-sea voyage to Mangareva, on the outskirts of French Polynesia. Then it is a flight to Tahiti where I catch another flight to Auckland and then onward to Christchurch. It can take me up to five days to get home. For Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent? \nIf you were contemplating a move to Pitcairn you would need to be self-reliant. It is an entrepreneur's dream as there are a number of small businesses on the island. \nIf you know an expat who wants to share inside knowledge of their home away from home, email escape@star-times.co.nz with Expat in the subject line, or click on the green 'Contribute' button above. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T02:06:28.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
