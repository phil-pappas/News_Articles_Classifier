It flourished as a playground for international jet-setters after being acquired in 1983 by South African businessman Sol Kerzner (of Sun City fame), who had opened the nearby Le Saint Géran resort a few years earlier. Kerzner later attached both properties to his new One&Only brand in late 2002, before vacating Le Touessrok in 2007. The resort’s excellent reputation then went into apparent decline, before it was acquired, and closed down for renovation, by Shangri-La Hotels & Resorts last April. Due to reopen on November 1, the brand-new Shangri-La’s Le Touessrok Resort & Spa is now taking reservations, with special opening room rates starting from €265 (HK$2,290) per night from November 1 to December 19. From January 6, rates will start from €425.

Englishman Thomas Stevens used a penny-farthing bicycle (and a few steamships) to get from San Francisco and back, via Europe, the Middle East, India, China and Japan, from April 1884 to December 1886. A decade later, American housewife Annie Kopchovsky (right) set off on a similar journey, then described in the media as “the most extraordinary journey ever undertaken by a woman”. Before she set off, Kopchovsky changed her name to Annie Londonderry (having been sponsored by the Londonderry Lithia Spring Water Company) and, like Stevens, travelled a fair distance by ocean steamer, getting from France to Japan (via Hong Kong) in just six weeks. Despite some apparent economy with the facts, it was an incredible achievement, yet by the time she died, in 1947, long-distance cycling was so commonplace that her obituary omitted any mention of it. Published next month, The Self-Propelled Voyager: How the Cycle Revolutionized Travel , by Duncan R. Jamieson, tells the stories of both these adventurers, and many others like them. It begins with the pioneers of cycling and looks at how the activity gradually became a popular mode of long-distance travel through the 20th century. Stevens’ self-penned Around the World on a Bicycle is still in print, and can be found in free digital editions online. Kopchovsky’s forgotten story was finally told in full in 2007, by her great-grandnephew Peter Zheutlin, in Around the World on Two Wheels: Annie Londonderry’s Extraordinary Ride . \nCapital ideas The Rosewood Beijing is selling two packages to stimulate the senses in two very different ways throughout September.
