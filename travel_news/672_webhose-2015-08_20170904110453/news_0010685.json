The research team uses the data to develop brand valuation tools that can be systematically applied in Thailand towards obtaining accurate CBS valuations, which raise awareness of the importance of sustainable corporate branding. \nChris Bailey, the Chief Operating Officer of Centara Hotels & Resorts commented that he recognizes the ongoing work that needs to be done in order to maintain and continue to build on the current Centara brand. “We understand that our brand extends so much further than our logo and marketing materials. Our brand is the entire customer experience from our website to our social media, and from the infrastructure of our properties to the interaction that a guest has with Centara staff. It is a full representation of Centara Hotels & Resorts, our values, our missions and our overall impact on creating experiences for our guests.” \nCentara Hotels & Resorts is Thailand’s leading hotel group, with 48 deluxe and first-class properties across Thailand, as well as 24 hotels and resorts in the Maldives, Vietnam, Bali, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Laos, Oman, Turkey and China. Centara also operates 25 branches of Spa Cenvaree, an award-winning spa brand, together with 6 branches of the value brand ‘Cense by Spa Cenvaree’. The company’s Kids’ Clubs are available at all their family-friendly resorts. Centara also operates three state-of-the-art convention centres in Bangkok, as well as two in northeastern Thailand.
