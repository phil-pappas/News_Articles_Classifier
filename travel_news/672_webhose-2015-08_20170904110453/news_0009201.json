With eight weekends of competition from the beginning of April until the end of May, the event attracts approximately 1,150 teams, 16,000 athletes, 2,500 coaches, 1,200 officials, 2,500 volunteers, local and national media and thousands of fans annually. Ontario Cup is considered one of the largest basketball events in North America.\nFor the first time in OBA hosting history, London had submitted a collaborative bid in partnership with Tourism London, London Ramblers, London CYO, Gold Medal, and London 86’ers basketball clubs as well as the London Board of Basketball Officials (LBBO). All four clubs will assist in the hosting responsibilities associated with this significant event.\n“Ontario Basketball is delighted to be hosting four of its Ontario Cup Provincial Championships in London in 2016,” said Jason Jansson, executive director, Ontario Basketball. “This bid is unique in the sense that Tourism London and all four OBA member clubs are collaborating to host the pinnacle event for Ontario Basketball. It is historic for the City of London and will make each tournament a community event and a celebration of our great sport.”\nOBA member clubs, alongside their local tourism groups were eligible to bid for the right to host an event for the 2016 season.\n“As a local basketball club, the opportunity to host four weekends in London helps to continue to establish London as a leader within the Provincial basketball community”, said Danielle Hall, president of the London Ramblers Basketball Club. “Events of this nature help to build awareness and strengthen partnerships which benefits our local youth.”\nOntario Basketball will once again team up with CSTT Sports Management International (CSTT) who will be the official hotel provider and supply OBA teams with exclusive booking and accommodation services for the 2016 championships. “We are thrilled to continue our 16 year relationship with Ontario Basketball in London and across the province.” said Gary Curgin, President of CSTT Sports Management International. “CSTT Sports Management will again be the exclusive accommodations partner for all 18 divisions for the 2016 Ontario Cup.”\nThere is significant economic impact associated with hosting these championships. A past Sport Tourism Economic Impact Study conducted by the Canadian Sport Tourism Alliance (CSTA) found that the economic impact generated by an Ontario Cup hosted in Ottawa was $1.9 million in the Province, with $1.3 million occurring in the city of Ottawa. An estimated $23 million of economic impact was generated by the entire Ontario Cup events.\n“We are very proud of our basketball community in London. The fact that we are all able to come to the table to work collaboratively to host these championships is a testament to our local infrastructure and event hosting experience.”, said Cheryl Finn, Director of Sport Tourism for Tourism London.\nSource:- London", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:12:21.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
