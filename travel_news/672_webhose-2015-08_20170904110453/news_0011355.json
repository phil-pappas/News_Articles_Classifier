GROUP EXHIBITION \"FIELDS OF ABSTRACTION\" September 16 to November 9, Hong Kong \"Fields of Abstraction\" unites four American artists working in experimental photography, etching, filmmaking and sculptural wall installation for a series of artworks that explore the abstraction of tone, pattern, chaos and texture.

FESTIVAL OF THE DEAD (BOUN KHAO SALAK) September 27, Luang Prabang, Laos During the festival of the dead, offerings are presented to Buddhist monks. On the last day, which is always the full moon, every family goes to the temple to make offerings to the deceased, especially to those who have passed away over the last year. It is believed that if the spirits do not receive offerings, it will bring bad luck to the living. In Luang Prabang during the festival, the Mekong is jammed with beautifully carved boats with snake-heads for prows. The serpent, or naga, appears in Buddhist literature as protector of Lord Buddha and that's the reason the boats are sacred and kept inside the temple precincts. Every year, 40 men from each temple parish volunteer to race in their temple’s boats. NOMAD’S DAY September 17 to 18, Gun Galuut Reserve, Mongolia Nomad's Day is the hotly anticipated day by Mongolian nomads. The major customs of nomadic life including horsemanship, wrestling and folkloric music and dance are demonstrated on these two special days, with groups competing with visitors to assembles gers in the shortest time, as well as make milk-tea, catch and tame horses and much more. The best of nomadic traditional cuisine is served on the evening of September 18. GIOSTRA DEL SARACINO (SARACEN JOUST OF AREZZO) September 6, Tuscany, Italy The city of Arezzo returns to the era of knights and beautiful maidens when Giostra del Saracino arrives. Saracen Joust of Arezzo is an ancient game of chivalry, held twice every year - on the third Saturday in June and on the first Sunday in September. Churches are decorated with pictures of 12th-century crusaders and the streets fill with people in medieval costumes. In the morning of the jousting day the town's Herald reads the proclamation of the joust challenge after which followed a colourful procession of costumed characters and horses parade along the streets. The blessing of the men-at-arms, which takes place on the steps of the Duomo and is given by the Bishop of Arezzo is the highlight of the parade. The jousters and their horses sport the colours and symbols of Arezzo's four districts, which are all hoping to win the Golden Lance. Rather than aiming their lances at each other, contestants score points by hitting a wooden target held by a carving of a Saracen (Islamic) king. HORN DANCE September 7, Staffordshire, England The Abbots Bromley Horn Dance, performed at the Barthelmy Fair in August 1226, is one of the few ritual rural customs to survive the passage of time. Today the Horn Dance, which takes place annually on Wakes Monday, offers a fascinating day out attracting visitors from all over the world. The participants take the six sets of deer antlers, which carbon dating has revealed to be about 1,000 years old, from the church. The Horn Dancers, comprising six Deer-men, a Fool, Hobby Horse, Bowman and Maid Marian, perform their dance to music provided by a melodian player at locations throughout the village and its surrounding farms and pubs. THE BRAEMAR GATHERING September 5, Aberdeenshire, Scotland The Braemar Gathering is always held on the first Saturday in September in the Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park in Braemar. Dating back 900 years to the reign of King Malcolm Canmore, the Braemar games took place informally for many centuries as tests of skill and strength. The games were formalised in 1820 due to the rise of Highland romanticism initiated by writer Sir Walter Scott and King George IV. Local lads and international athletes alike compete in events including tug-of-war, a hill race up the 860m Morrone, hammer throwing, stone-putting and the long jump. Less rigorous entertainment includes Highland dancing, pipers and the children's sack race. 332 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T05:26:07.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
