News Corp Australia 31 Jul 2015 News Travel Ant took this pic on a lovely June day and just about had the beach — and his humility — to himself. Source: NewsComAu \nI WAS wrong. There, it’s been said. And you know what? It doesn’t even hurt to say it. Actually it feels like a burden has been lifted. Here’s what this is all about. \nTwo-and-a-half years ago, the website Tripadvisor.com released a list of the world’s best beaches. A place called Rhossili Bay in Wales bobbed up at number three on the list — higher than any Australian beach. \nA Welsh beach? One of the world’s top three beaches? Needless to say, I was sceptical. So I rang the publican of the colourfully named Worms Head Hotel overlooking Rhossili Bay to ask just what made his beach so special. \nJulian Short waxed lyrical about the soft sand, the downs (rolling grassy hills) behind the beach and the excellent cod-and-chips served in the dining room of his pub. \nWhile admitting that the water was so cold — six degrees in winter and barely 14 in summer — that neither he nor his son Adrian had ever actually swum there, Mr Short assured us that the beach was still enormously popular with surfers and Russians, who don’t mind a bit of cold water. Ant’s feeling a little sheepish for being so mean in 2013. Source: NewsComAu \nWell, we ran the story and the internet just about exploded. Or it did in Britain anyway. The media over there accused us of all sort of beach bigotry, and we loaded up and returned fire with our special brand of sandy snarkiness. \n“We Will Fight Them on the Beaches,” we thundered in our reply . Thinking about it now, we might also have gone with the headline: “Six degrees of separation: Why our beaches are better than theirs.” \nWhile things got a little feisty, it was all in fun. Above all I became curious. Which is why, on a recent trip to the UK, I decided I simply had to see Rhossili Bay for myself. \nThe trip from Bristol, where I was staying, took about three hours. I’m told it only takes half that long when you don’t get lost on Welsh freeways, but trust me, you will definitely get lost on Welsh freeways — mainly because you spend so long trying to read unpronounceable town names, you miss your turn-off every time. Sigh. It was actually really lovely there. Source: NewsComAu \nSo allow three hours from Bristol, or about five from London. Towards the end of the trip you pass through the pretty city of Swansea (Wales’s second largest), then along the Gower Peninsula, which is a lovely mix of seaside and rural landscapes. \nRhossili bay is a pretty town perched high on a headland with whitewashed houses and a real villagey feel. You open the car door to walk down to the beach of the same name ... and the door slams right back at you because of the wind. \nWhoa, is it windy up here. That wind would not only blow a dog off its chain, but the chain off the pole it was tethered to. \nRefuge can be found in the Worms Head Hotel where the cod and chips is every bit as good as Julian Short once promised. Crunchy batter, juicy fresh fish. Nice crispy, fleshy chips. Spectacular local beer. It doesn’t get much better. Cod blimey, this was a great lunch. Source: NewsComAu \nThe beach is about a five-minute walk down the hill and yes, it’s terrific too. The sand is soft and clean, there are lots of shells, and the wind, though strong, is a little less blustery than up on the headland. \nAbove all, the beach is wide and expansive. It’s easy in Britain to feel the prettiness of nature but not the wildness, the rawness, as you do in Australia. Here I experienced both, as did the small handful of British families frolicking in the sand. \nThe sand, by the way, was lovely and fine. Not a pebble in sight. There’s a grain of truth in every best beaches poll. Source: NewsComAu \nBut the water. That all-important water. Was it bearable? Yes it was. It was not exactly warm, but I had a good swim for several minutes without getting particularly cold. The water was lovely and clean too. \nObviously on balance you’ll find beaches that are warmer and more enticing in every single state of Australia. But is Rhossili worth a visit? Nice view back the other way, too. Source: NewsComAu \nYou bet it is. In truth this place is magnificent. I really was quite taken by Rhossili Bay and I’m sorry I didn’t give it the credit it deserves back in 2013. \nWell, I have now.
