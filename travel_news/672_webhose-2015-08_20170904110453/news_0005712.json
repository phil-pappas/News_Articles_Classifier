'I sprayed it with a product called Plant Rescue that seemed to do the trick. Unfortunately the product is no longer available, except to professional gardeners, I am told. My hedge is under stress again. Can you help?' Plant Rescue used to contain imidacloprid, a systemic insecticide (absorbed via leaves and stems) now withdrawn because of strong evidence that it harms bees. Its active ingredient is now thiamethoxam, one of the still-available neonicotinoids that, like thiacloprid (in Provado Ultimate Bug Killer) and acetamiprid (in Bug Clear Gun!) may be on borrowed time. The black sticky residue is, as you say, the (indirect) work of aphids and is a mould that grows on their secretions. If (as is often the case) the aphids are heavily infesting trees overhanging your hedge, you will have a long-term battle on your hands. If you are determined to fight on, and bearing in mind that bees will not be busy at this time anyway, you could go ahead and use either Ultimate Bug Killer or Bug Clear Ultra (a systemic man-made pyrethroid), spraying in the evening. In addition, you should boost the hedge’s growth and health: loosen the soil slightly around its base and feed it (two fistfuls per metre) with a general fertiliser (such as blood, fish and bone). Then drench the root area slowly with a hose.
