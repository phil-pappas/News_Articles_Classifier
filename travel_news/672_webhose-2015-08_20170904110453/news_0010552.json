There is still time to plan a last-minute short break or day trip in England, whatever the weather.”\nMeanwhile, the Association of British Travel Agents predicts 1.9 million people will be grabbing their passports and heading overseas from Friday to Monday. Many are going in search of warmer temperatures, with Abta members reporting strong sales in the Balearic and Canary Islands, as well as coastal resorts on mainland Spain . Trips to Portugal and Turkey are also proving popular. Abta based its estimate of 1.9 million foreign holidays on figures from previous years.\nAirports in the south-east are expected to be very busy, with around 550,000 passengers departing from Heathrow, 270,000 from Gatwick, 145,000 from Stansted and 87,000 from Luton. Around 175,000 are due to take off from Manchester while 150,000 will leave from Scottish airports. Hundreds of thousands of people will depart from other regional airports, sea ports and the Channel Tunnel.\nMark Tanzer, Abta chief executive, said: “This weekend is always one of the busiest of the year, with hundreds of thousands taking advantage of the long bank holiday weekend to head overseas for some guaranteed sunshine.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T03:11:04.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
