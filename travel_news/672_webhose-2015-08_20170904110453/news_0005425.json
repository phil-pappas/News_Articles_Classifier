CEO Ed Nichols , COO Kathryn Hill and state historian Bill Convery — who led the Denver-based nonprofit through construction of its new downtown history museum that has led to massive increases in both attendance and membership — have opted to take a voluntary early-retirement option that was offered to all 130 staffers under the budget cuts. Nichols said Thursday that he plans to leave his day-to-day operational role next month, though he will stay involved with the board of directors and help them through the executive transition process. While the downtown History Colorado Center has quadrupled its attendance from that of the group's former museum since opening the new building in 2012 , it has suffered because state gambling revenues — which account for roughly two-thirds of its operating budget have nosedived since the recession and have not rebounded to pre-recession levels yet. Where the center got $12.2 million a year from that funding source in 2007 as it laid out its expansion plan, it received just $9.3 million from it for this fiscal year, despite forecasting growth of 3 to 4 percent a year from the pre-recession mark, Nichols said. As a result, a committee has met since December on how to right the operational financial shift and came up with the two-year strategy involving retirement incentives and reduction of expenses ranging from travel costs to delay of software and technology upgrades, said Ann Alexander Pritzlaff , chairwoman of the group’s board. Board members also are looking at new ways to raise funds for the Denver museum and the eight other museums History Colorado operates throughout the state, including a potential new fundraising campaign resembling the effort that helped to build the $110.8 million, 58,561-square-foot building at 1200 Broadway, she said. Nichols, who has served as CEO for eight years, saw the time of financial transition as an opportunity to step away after accomplishing what he had signed on to do as head of the organization just as it was launching its expansion. Annual visitation at the Denver museum grew from 57,000 to more than 200,000 during his tenure, and the “1968” exhibit that ran from February through May set records for show-specific attendance. Also, membership has increased by more than 50 percent. “It is a tough decision in that I love what I’m doing,” said Nichols, emphasizing in an interview that he was not asked to leave his post by the board. “But I also have done what I can do. And I think it’s time for the board to pick a team to go forward.” It’s not just the top staffers changing for the organization. After a 2014 audit questioned the oversight of the organization, the Legislature passed a new law earlier this year reorganizing the board and requiring the governor to appoint its members. Three of the eight existing board members started their tenure on July 1, and a new ninth member is expected to be appointed soon. Pritzlaff said that the state’s historical-preservation grant program will be unaffected by the budget cutbacks. And she said that visitors to History Colorado museums should not notice any differences, other than the expansion of the Ute Indian Museum in Montrose that will proceed as planned despite the cuts. The board will announce an interim CEO soon and will consider the makeup of an entirely new executive team as it looks to the future, she said. It will look to fill the shoes of Nichols and Hill with people who will keep the mission of the organization robust and will maintain financial stability through good management and increased revenue generation, she said. \nGet Denver  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:12:02.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
