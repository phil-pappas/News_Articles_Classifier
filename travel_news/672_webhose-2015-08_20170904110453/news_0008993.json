They will be pleased to know that Copenhagen Airport will be completing the extensive renovation of one of its main runways slightly ahead of schedule.\nSince early July, one of Copenhagen Airport’s two main runways has been closed for an extensive renovation and expansion project. This has meant many take-offs and landings over both Copenhagen and Malmo in Sweden; while some people have been fascinated by the low-flying aircraft coming in for landing over the city, it has also been a major inconvenience to many local residents who have had to put up with the extra noise.\nFortunately, it is over now. The easterly of the airport’s two main runways, the 04R/22L, will reopen this coming Monday, 31 August at 6:00 am, a week earlier than scheduled. This means most of the air traffic over the capital will return to the usual pattern with the vast majority of take-offs and landings taking place over water to make the inconvenience to residents and businesses close to the airport as little as possible.\nSource:- Copenhagen Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:12:59.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
