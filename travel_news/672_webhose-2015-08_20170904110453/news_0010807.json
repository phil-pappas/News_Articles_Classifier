At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Aaron (VP - IR): Thank you. Good day everyone. We reported Tiffany's second-quarter results earlier today so hopefully you've read the news release. I am coming to you this morning from New York while it's evening in Shanghai where Ralph is joining us on this call. On today's call we will review the quarterly results and how they relate to our growth strategies and then comment on the outlook for the rest of the year. Before continuing please note that statements made on this call that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Actually results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. So from an overall perspective second-quarter financial results from the top line to the bottom line continued to be significantly pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and worldwide net sales as reported were flat to last year. However, excluding the substantial negative translation effect from that strong dollar, second-quarter worldwide sales rose 7% ranging from an increase of 27% in Japan to 19% in Europe to 9% in Asia-Pacific to the Americas where sales were unchanged from the prior year and lastly to other sales which declined 27%, all of which I'll explain in a moment. The strong dollar has also had meaningful and diverging effects on foreign tourist spending by region. We added six new stores in the quarter and expanded our product assortment with new jewelry and watch designs. Gross margin was unchanged in the quarter and the SG&A expense ratio rose. We also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10 million, or $0.05 per diluted share for a portion of a loan we made to a diamond mining company. As a result, net earnings declined 16% in the quarter but excluding the impairment charge net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis which was in line with our expectation. Let's now look at sales performance by region in the second quarter. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis, both total and comparable-store sales were equal to last year which compared with an 8% comp increase in last year's second quarter. Looking forward we are facing another tough comparison to an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. In this second quarter once again higher domestic spending in the Americas largely tied to strength in statement jewelry sales was offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S. especially in New York and Hawaii which we attribute primarily to the effect from the strong U.S. dollar. But generally speaking, our sales results in the Americas in the second quarter and first half apart from the strength at the highest statement jewelry price points have reflected varying degrees of softness across much of the US. Conversely comp store sales in Canada and Latin America have been strong. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 2% as favorable price and mix was offset by lower jewelry unit volume, largely tied to continued weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points as well as a unit decline in fine jewelry. We opened one store in the Americas during the quarter in Rideau Center in Ottawa replacing an older store that we had closed last year. And we are looking forward to opening Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago next month. Also we recently relocated one of our shops in Montreal from Holt Renfrew to the nearby Ogilvy department store. We will soon be relocating our store in Denver's Cherry Creek Mall to an enhanced location within the mall. We're in the process of doing a similar relocation of our Century City store in LA and we're relocating a department store location in Mexico, all of which exemplify our strategy to optimize the quality of our distribution base. 1 of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:55:04.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
