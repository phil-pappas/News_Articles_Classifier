Madame Lynch and Av. Aviadores del Chaco in Asuncion . The project will have a deadline for completion of one year and a budget of over 21 million euros .\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150129/727670 )\nThe company will execute an overpass consisting of a viaduct on Av. Aviadores del Chaco permitting flow towards Silvio Pettirossi highway, a tunnel in the trace of Madame Lynch to provide continuity to direct flows from the Avenue, and a level roundabout that will allow for different flow direction changes.\nThis is a key stage in the road network of the city of Asuncion , whose geographical location determines the constant flow of traffic in and out of the city.\nThe geographical location of the intersection of the two arteries and the traffic will determine the unique complexity of the work to be performed; it will be necessary to more effectively combine the construction, the traffic maintenance and the minimization of traffic congestion. This will involve making a careful plan of the work to be carried out and coordinated implementation on all fronts of the works.\n©2015 ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150129/727670", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201508176758&Transmission_Id=201508170844PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201508176758&DateId=20150817", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:00:25.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
