More Tunisia attack to cost Tui up to €40m \nAfter a decade of rapid growth, annual gaming revenue fell in Macau for the first time in 2014 as the Chinese high-rollers who had been driving growth in the former Portuguese territory took fright at Beijing’s anti-graft measures. \nThe pressure on the gaming groups is set to grow as they are scheduled to open more than $20bn worth of new casinos and entertainment facilities this year and next. \nGalaxy Entertainment , controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Lui Che-woo , on Wednesday reported that first-half earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 43 per cent year-on-year to HK$4.2bn ($542m) as revenue dropped 34 per cent to HK$25.4bn. \nThat rounded out results for the sector that also includes Hong Kong-listed Melco Crown , MGM China , Sands China , SJM Holdings and Wynn Macau . \nMr Lui, who is also Galaxy’s chairman, called the results “credible” given that “market conditions within Macau remain challenging”. \nHe said earnings were hit by costs related to the opening of the $3.2bn extension of Galaxy’s Macau casino resort but that the new entertainment and shopping facilities would help extend the appeal to mass-market customers. \nAs VIP gamblers from mainland China have shunned Macau, gaming companies and the local government have tried to make-up for the revenue shortfall by attracting more non-gambling visitors. \nBut analysts say they will struggle to replicate the success of Las Vegas in moving to a revenue model more reliant on entertainment and tourism than on takings at the gaming tables. \n“The extension might help Galaxy to build incremental market share,” said Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming Research in Macau. “But in the current environment, with the corruption crackdown ongoing, it is going to be tough to grow this market with new supply.” \nMr Govertsen said recent moves by the Macau government, including a relaxation on visas for mainland visitors and talk of easing a proposed smoking ban, had provided some support to the industry and fanned hopes that the slowdown was “bottoming out”. \nRobert Drake, Galaxy’s chief financial officer, said that while there had been some signs of “stabilisation” it was “to early to call the bottom”. \nAnalysts at Daiwa Capital Markets believe there is more bad news to come. \n“From what we have seen on the ground in Macau, the market continues to underestimate the impact of liquidity constraints, the Chinese renminbi depreciation, cost inflation and negative operating leverage,” they wrote in a report.
