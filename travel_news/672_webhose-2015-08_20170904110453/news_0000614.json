The reserve attracted 7,934 foreign and domestic tourists in 2014 and 3,700 in 2013.\nAccording to Sernanp, this growth was driven by improved services and infrastructure (signing, interpretation center, cafeteria and restrooms).\nIn addition, the sites’ excellent state of conservation has contributed to this sustained growth and the Peruvian State is further investing in infrastructure through the execution of major projects for the following years.\n“We have taken important measures to improve services offered to visitors seeking new recreational activities in natural sites; they include new signaling, a passport to visit 10 protected areas, a tourist manual in English, a free application for smart phones, promotional rates, sale of admission tickets to natural areas via Teleticket and promotional campaigns,” Sernanp head Pedro Gamboa said.\nThe Huascaran National Park was the most visited natural destination, reaching 25,634 domestic and foreign vacationers. During these holidays, the number of visits has grown by 29% compared to last year.\nThe most popular spot in this area were Chinancocha Lagoon in Llanganuco (with 12,176 visitors) and the Climate Change Route in the Pastoruri glacier, (with 4,812).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:19:11.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
