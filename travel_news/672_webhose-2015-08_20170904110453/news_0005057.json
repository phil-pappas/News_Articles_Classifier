Add enough champagne to cover (about 100ml). Leave the jelly to soften for 10 minutes. Bring a pan of water to the boil and place the bowl of softened gelatin on top. Once the gelatin has totally melted, stir in the sugar until it has dissolved and add another 100ml of champagne to the mixture. Combine the mixture with the rest of the champagne by pouring it through a sieve – to remove any unmelted lumps – and into a measuring jug. Squeeze the lemon through the sieve too. Top up with champagne until you have 500ml. Place the washed fruit into the bottom of a jelly mould and pour in about one third of the jelly. Leave until set enough so that the fruit seems safely embedded (about 2 hours), then pour over the rest of the jelly mixture and return to the refrigerator. If you don’t want to set the fruit in the mould first, you can always add everything to the mould at once. Doing a double set, however, makes sure that the fruit floats elegantly in the jelly rather than sinking to the bottom. Recipe from Jelly with Bompas & Parr by Sam Bompas & Harry Parr (Pavilion).
