The total tram network is now 32km in length, serves seven parks and ride sites, and is able to cater for up to 20 million passenger journeys a year.\n“We’re delighted to have finished what was the region’s biggest construction project and, more importantly, a project that offers the people of Nottingham a modern, effective, low carbon transportation system. Everyone can now see, and enjoy, the benefits of the expanded network,” said Terence Watson, UK Managing Director of Alstom Transport.\n“Whilst not without its challenges, it has been a hugely significant project for the city. We set out to create a world class tram network for Nottingham and all consortium partners are proud to have worked together to ensure we achieve that aim” said Steve Lowe, Chief Executive of Tramlink1 Nottingham.\nThe joint venture built all associated infrastructure for the project, including overhead wires, track and signalling.\nAlstom also supplied 22 Citadis trams to the city which now form part of the 37-strong tram fleet serving the city, with Alstom also maintaining all of the vehicles. Alstom is also a Tramlink Nottingham consortium member, together with Keolis, Wellglade, Vinci UK, Meridiam Infrastructure and Infravia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:09:49.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
