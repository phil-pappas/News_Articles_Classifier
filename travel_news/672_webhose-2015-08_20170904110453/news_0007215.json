If passed by the full Legislative Assembly, the program would restructure the debt of more than 70 tourism businesses and provide them with administrative consulting.\nEligible businesses are those in arrears for over 60 days or that already are facing sequestration proceedings in court.\nFunding for the bailout would come from the Banking Development System ( SBD ), which would donate $10 million, while the Costa Rican Tourism Board would add $3.5 million for eight-year loans.\nThe proposal states that banks would be responsible for evaluating each case. Their assessment then would be used for outlining the specifics of debt restructuring, mostly by offering more favorable interest rates and extended periods.\nThe plan states that the debt to be restructured cannot exceed 33 percent of the remaining amount, with a maximum for each debtor of up to $175,000.\nLawmakers approved the draft of the bill at a Thursday evening session attended by Tourism Minister Mauricio Ventura and Economy Minister Welmer Ramos. Both officials said they are in favor of the initiative and endorsed the proposed measures for selecting companies that will benefit.\nThe draft now heads to discussion at the full Assembly, “which is expected to approve it in an expedited process,” commission president Luis Vásquez Castro said.\nThe bailout plan is part of a priority list of bills sent by the executive branch to be discussed in the Legislative Assembly this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:04:17.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
