The gun was seen in the man's carry-on bag by an officer staffing a checkpoint X-ray machine. \nThe man, identified only as a Lutherville resident, was ticketed to fly to Long Island-MacArthur Airport in New York. A man with a loaded semi-automatic handgun was arrested Wednesday at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, Transportation Security Administration officials said. ( Brandi Bottalico ) \nThe TSA contacted Maryland Transportation Authority Police, who responded to the checkpoint, confiscated the gun and arrested the man on weapons charges. There was no impact on airport operations. \nMeanwhile, TSA officers at Hagerstown Regional Airport on Thursday stopped a Virginia man from bringing a loaded semi-automatic gun onto a plane, the TSA said. The initial investigation indicates the incidents were unrelated. \nFirearms, firearm parts and ammunition are not permitted in carry-on bags, but can be transported in checked bags if they are unloaded, properly packed and declared to the airline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:28:26.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
