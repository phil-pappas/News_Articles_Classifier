In doing so, we hope to offer leaders the chance to freshly recall first-hand the European Union ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony,\" says Carlo Boselli, General Manager of Eurail Group G.I.E. \nMr. Boselli emphasises, \"By inviting leaders to undertake their own Interrail journey we are ultimately inviting them to celebrate the values we all collectively share as part of the European Union.\" \nInterrail authentically embodies the essence of a shared European co-operation, with borderless, unlimited rail travel across 30 European countries. Each year, over 220,000 European residents of all ages use Interrail to meet and engage with other likeminded people, alternative cultures, and learn about the rich history and diversity of Europe. \n\"Through our passengers we witness Interrail being a life changing experience, helping to build greater intercultural understanding and foster cross-cultural peace and prosperity amongst people living in Europe,\" said Mr. Boselli. \nEurail Group G.I.E. has written to leaders directly to provide the personal Interrail invitation. With a special two-year timeframe to undertake their own Interrail experience, the act serves as an expression to leaders to personally connect with the distinct, interwoven cultural fabrics that form Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:27:01.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
