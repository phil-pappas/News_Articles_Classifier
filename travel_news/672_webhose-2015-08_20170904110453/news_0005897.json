Neighboring Kenya and Uganda also secure up to one billion USD annually from eco-tourism, he added.\nMihret said Ethiopia, which is endowed with diverse tourist attractions, earned only 60 million Birr annually from eco-tourism although the country was home to at least 16 types of endemic bird species which showed that the revenue earned from eco-tourism was too low.\nAccording to him, the lack of sufficient promotional work in the sector was the reason for the poor performance of the eco-tourism sub-sector. There was insufficient activity in promoting the expanded new and old tourist attractions which limited the earnings, he pointed out.\nThe number of tourists visiting Ethiopia has jumped more than one million annually and activities are underway to achieve the plan to increase the figure to more than six million within the next five years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T20:21:46.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
