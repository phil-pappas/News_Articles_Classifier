After naming Facebook the most popular social network for the over 50s , Silversurfers revealed that one in six people over 50 will use the website to check out their exes. “Stalking” exes is one way we make sense out of past relationships Dr Pamela Rutledge 57-year-old Deborah sometimes finds herself looking at the profile of her former partner from when she was in her 30s. They were together for eight years, though never married: \"We came close, but never went through with it,\" Deborah says. Now, married herself and almost twenty years later, Deborah still finds herself checking up on her ex occasionally. \"I friended him first. We have one or two mutual friends still and when I saw his name I wondered if I should or not. He accepted and we've been Facebook friends for several years now.\" At first, Deborah found herself checking his profile frequently though over the years this has changed. \"I'll look if he appears on my newsfeed,\" she says, \"he married a few months ago and posted loads of photos of the wedding so I had a peek at those. I'm married myself now so it didn't hurt to see - in fact I was quite happy for him - but I did wonder about how that had almost been my life.\" 1 in 6 over 50s use Facebook to keep up with their exes (Alamy) Dr Pamela Rutledge, Director at the Media Psychology Center , says being able to look at past flames on Facebook \"validates our memories and reinforces social connection. As we look back on old relationships, we are naturally curious about those people. 'Stalking' exes is one way we make sense of past relationships. The key is to use them in a positive way and not allow yourself to sink into an 'if only' downward spiral.\" The research from Silversurfers also revealed that 16 per cent of over 50s will admit to uploading particularly flattering selfies so they can show their old flames just how well they have aged. Dr Rutledge says this part of our natural desire to want to feel attractive and desirable: \"Uploading attractive selfies can be a positive and affirming experience for “older” people. It helps break the stereotypical images of people, women especially, being unattractive later in life. We only have to look at people like Helen Mirren, Jane Fonda, Judy Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon or Julie Andrews to see that age is being redefined.\" @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:24:26.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
