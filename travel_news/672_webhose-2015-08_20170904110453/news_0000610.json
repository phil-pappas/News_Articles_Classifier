Zimbabwean officials say they are seeking the extradition of another American, James Walter Palmer, for killing a well-known lion named Cecil in an early July hunt that was allegedly illegal. \nPalmer has said he relied on his professional guides to ensure the lion hunt was legal. \nSeski did not respond to messages left Sunday by The Associated Press at his home and with an answering service for his medical practice. The AP also knocked on the door at Seski's house. \n\"He conducted his hunt in good faith and now he is being treated as if he is some criminal,\" Sibanda said from his safari area near Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park. \"He is an honest man who came into this country to give us business. He doesn't deserve all this attention and harassment. He should be allowed to have a good night's sleep because his conscience should be clear. Everything was done aboveboard.\" \nTo support his argument that the hunt was legal, Sibanda noted that he had not been arrested. The government wildlife management body, however, said Sibanda had no permit to hunt lions on his land and that an investigation was underway. \nThink your friends should see this?
