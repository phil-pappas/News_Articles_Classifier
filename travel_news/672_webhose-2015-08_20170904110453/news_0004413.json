A heads up to clear your schedule: The must-see television event of 2015 starts tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox . Here are the five most important things you need to know to help start your busy business day: $1B residential community gets started on riverfront Toebben Builders is finally getting started on the $1 billion Rivers Pointe Estates community in Hebron , Tom Demeropolis reports. Toebben has for years been assembling land and waiting for the right time to start the project; the first phase will include eight riverview home sites called the Reserve, with homes starting at $650,000. Money quote from John Toebben : “It’s been a long endeavor.” Five Things to Know About 'Gentle C-section': A sponsored message from The Christ Hospital Health Network . CVG adds new tenant Dayton-based PSA Airlines plans to build a \"substantial\" maintenance base at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport , writes Tristan Navera, a reporter for our sister paper, the Dayton Business Journal . PSA has acquired space at CVG to convert it into a maintenance facility that will open later this year. PSA is a fast-growing, wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines and the only commercial passenger airline based in Ohio. Winburn holds key to 'weaker-mayor' ballot measure The question of whether Cincinnati voters could get a chance to amend the city's charter in a way that would reduce the mayor's power likely will come down to Councilman Charlie Winburn . Chris Wetterich writes that five council members already support putting the measure on the ballot, but six votes are needed. Council is expected to consider an amendment to remove the mayor’s so-called “pocket veto,” which allows him or her to shelve proposed ordinances almost indefinitely and another that would allow a supermajority of council members to dismiss the city manager without council’s consent. Why tonight's GOP debate matters Jokes aside (see above), the 10 Republican candidates invited by Fox to the first big presidential debate include Ohio Gov. John Kasich . Kasich is the 2015 version of a moderate Republican on a stage filled with hard-right rock throwers. He's also the popular governor of the ultimate swing state. The nation at large will meet Kasich tonight, and that's why the debate matters. I Spy Cincinnati I give up. But don't be a quitter like me! Here's the latest clue in our weekly photo quiz. This day in history On this day 70 years ago, in World War II, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima by the U.S. B-29 Superfortress \"Enola Gay.\" Within the first few months afterward, the acute effects killed between 90,000 and 166,000 people.
