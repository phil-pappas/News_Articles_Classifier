July saw an all-time high surge in arrivals at 31.2% crossing a million arrivals and Tourism receipts touching a $1.3 million dollars which augurs well for the country he said. However, the worry is the fast tracking pace of the informal sector that accounts for 49% of the industry whilst the formal business entities are flat on top line which needs focused policy support for correction voiced Dr. Athukorala.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T18:51:43.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
