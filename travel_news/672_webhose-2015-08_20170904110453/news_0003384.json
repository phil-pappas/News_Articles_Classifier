No longer; many residences have been sympathetically restored to offer guests the chance to spend the night with the the ghosts of their favourite writers.\nFrom Dickens’ studio, where he worked on his literary magazine, to Aldous Huxley’s cabin in the middle of nowhere, you're likely to feel inspired with a stay at these cottages with literary connections.\nJohn Steinbeck’s Writer’s Studio, California \nHere is the place where Steinbeck used to work on his words This cosy cabin was once owned by Grapes of Wrath author John Steinbeck. He used it as his writing studio and penned novel The Sea of Cortez here. While it has been renovated, it’s kept the quaint charm, but also has wifi and a TV for those who want to indulge in some modern luxuries.\nAldous Huxley’s Cabin, New Mexico \nHuxley and Lawrence both used this as a writing den Tucked away in a goji berry farm in New Mexico is Huxley’s live-in writing cabin. The Brave New World writer's residence now sleeps four travellers looking for some literary nostalgia. DH Lawrence also made this his writing retreat. Two literary giants for the price of one.\nCharles Dickens’ city apartment, London \nThis is where Dickens worked on All The Year Round This one-bed city escape was formerly Dickens’ workspace, where he founded the ‘All The Year Round’ magazine. Now thoroughly modern, this flat is just a stone's throw away from Covent Garden.\nFrancisco de Quevedo’s apartment, Madrid \nOne of Spain's top authors wrote and lived here One of Spain’s most important writers kept his home here. Located in the Cortes district, this apartment is incredibly central, making it a useful base for visitors to the Spanish capital. Moreover, Miguel de Cervantes, of Don Quixote fame, was laid to rest in a tomb in Trinitarians’ Convent, which is right in front of this apartment building.\nDaphne du Maurier - 'Farthings', Cornwall \nThe cottage looks out over a cove (Picture: Blue Chip Holidays) While du Maurier didn't actually live or stay in this cottage, its location - the town of Fowey - inspired her bestseller Rebecca. Farthings looks out over the cove, and is located right opposite Readymoney Cottage, where the writer lived. The Daphne du Maurier literary festival - Fowey Festival - is also held near here each year around May time. \nBeatrix Potter’s 'Yew Tree Farm', Lake District \nThe house is tucked in between Lake District hills (Picture: Yew Tree Farm) This farmhouse was once owned by Beatrix Potter and is nestled in the Coniston Valley. It was the setting for the biographical movie, Miss Potter, starring Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor. The house operates as a working farm, and guests can collect their own eggs for breakfast from the farm chickens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:49:37.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
