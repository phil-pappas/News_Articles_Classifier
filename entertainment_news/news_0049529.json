Over in China, they’re going to say, ‘Now, that’s a wall!’”\"Trump is just like everybody else,\" added Strong, “He puts his hair on one strand at a time.\" \nTrump wasn't so pleased later in Saturday's show , when Hillary Clinton joined Kate McKinnon, who played the Democratic presidential candidate, as a sympathetic bartender named Val, who consoled McKinnon’s Clinton as she rattled off her problems. \nDuring the sketch, Clinton, as Val, poked fun at Trump, noting, “Isn’t he the one that’s like, ‘Ugh, you’re all losers?’” \nShortly after the Clinton skit aired on the East Coast, Trump tweeted , \"@TaranKillam plays a way better fake @realDonaldTrump than a real @HillaryClinton plays herself.” \nTrump didn't have any comment about a \" Weekend Update\" segment in which the show's Pete Davidson, compared him to American Idol season-six finalist Sanjaya, who made it into the top 10 based on viewer votes, despite being poorly received by the show's judges. \n“America needs to stop doing things because it’s funny,” noted Davidson.“Now that he's winning, I have to go out and vote. A Trump presidency is so terrifying. You know who he reminds me of? Sanjaya from American Idol . Same hair, same garbage.” \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
