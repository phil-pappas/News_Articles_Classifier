Related \nClick here to watch the story. \n“It's an immersive film experience that you can only get in a museum,” said Steve Perkins, of Echo. \nStarting Oct. 10, the new Northfield Savings Bank theater will loop two National Geographic movies each day: \"Living in the Age of Airplanes\" and \"Sea Monsters: A Prehistoric Adventure.\" \nThe films run about 45 minutes, and ‘Sea Monsters’ is in 3D. \n“We have partnered with National Geographic, which everyone knows makes a great magazine and great films, to bring their museum-specific films here to Echo,” said Perkins. \nWhile the new, state of the art theater is a permanent fixture, the films will change every three months, giving visitors a variety they wouldn't ordinarily find at echo. \n“You know, it takes a long time to change an exhibit, so we don't change our exhibits every three months,” said Perkins. \nBut other changes are coming to the science center. Just across from the theater, Echo is in the middle of building its new preschool play space, which is expected to be finished early 2016. \nThanks to a grant from Google, what may look like a bunch of colorful light bulbs now, will be a first of its kind 3-D LED light display that's scheduled to be up and running by December. \nFor more information on times and pricing for the National Geographic Experience, click here.
