As it stands, Captain Marvel won't be hitting our screens until 2018 at the earliest and the casting is still up for debate. Names like Charlize Theron, Emily Blunt and a few others have been rumoured, yet Rousey is the only who's actively campaigned for the role.\nThat campaign has reached the ears of Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios' head honcho who is reportedly a fan of her campaign and what's she doing. When asked what he thought of it, Feige said that he \"loved it.\"\nMarvel have had a lot of success with left-of-field casting choices, particularly when you look at former WWE star Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy or TV sitcom star Chris Pratt, who's now the biggest thing in the world.\nFeige, too, knows this. \"You look at the ways we’ve cast our films in the past and it’s always about who’s the best person to inhabit the character, whether that is an actor like Chris Hemsworth who bulks up, or a wrestler like Dave Bautista who played Drax who ends up being an amazing performer, an amazing actor and a clever and witty and pointed comedic actor.\"\n\"For us, it’s sitting down with people and starting to meet people and as the script takes shape and as we start to build who the character should be and finding the right person to match it up,\" explained Feige in a recent interview.\nThe question now, of course, is whether or not Ronda Rousey and Marvel have had a meeting and what went down. Considering her dance-card is starting to fill up pretty quickly - she's signed on for a remake of Patrick Swayze's Road House and she's doing an 8 Mile / Eminem with a biopic of her own life - Marvel would want to move fast if they're going to sign her on.\nIt's pretty safe to say that Rousey could open a film all on her own and when you team that with Marvel's promotional campaigns and the general goodwill Rousey commands, it's a recipe for box-office success. We won't know anything until later next year as Feige confirmed the role would be cast then.\nWhat do you think? Is Rousey a good choice for Captain Marvel?
