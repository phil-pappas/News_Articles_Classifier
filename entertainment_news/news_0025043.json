As artist, he always strives to push the envelope further, noting, “The best thing about collaborating with younger acts (is) everything that comes out of it is something fresh.”\nWorking with an icon\nThe artists Gary invited for the shows are ecstatic working with the icon.\nBullet, 29, who got to know Gary personally via the Elements Music Camp said, “Sobrang hindi ako makapaniwala at first. Pero I’m happy that I’m part of this. Sana mag-enjoy kayo. I hope you’ll enjoy whatever we are planning to do.”\nRJ, on his part, admitted he is a long time fan of Gary. “Even while I was in California, I would always watch his concerts. I actually told myself once, ‘One day I wanna be on stage with him.’ And now that it is finally happening I’m just so happy.”\nTimmy likes it that Gary always reminds him to “never forget life, never forget God in your music, and why you are singing.”\nMeanwhile, Maki is already quite nervous simply thinking about performing with Gary. “(Pero) s’yempre it’s an honor, a big honor for me,” he said. “Kasi hindi naman lahat nabibigyan ng chance to perform with him, ’di ba?”\nLara is excited to see how fans would react to the shows. “Kasi sa concert (na ito) isang masarap na masarap na chop suey ang ipapatikim namin so sana magustuhan ninyo,” she said.\nSo-called “Suklay Diva” Katrina was mentored by Gary on “X Factor Philippines.” Although they’ve performed together in past outings, she maintained, “Ibang-iba ito sa mga shows na ginagawa namin ni Tito Gary.”\nMonique, who, like Katrina, has been mentored by Gary on the show, added, “I could only be so grateful na binigyan niya po kami uli ng chance na makakanta kasama s’ya dito sa project na ito… talagang hindi niya kami pinabayaan and I’m so happy.”\nJanice shared she has long been dreaming of performing with Gary. “Ngayon, sobrang sobrang sarap sa pakiramdaman na abot-kamay na s’ya.”\n“I am so honored. Isang malaking karangalan para sa kagaya ko na, napapasama sa concert ni sir Gary,” Mitoy said.\n“Gary V Presents” happens on Oct. 30 and 31 at the Newport Performing Arts Theater of Resorts World Manila.\nCo-directed by Gary and his son Paolo Valenciano, with musical direction by Mon Faustino, the show is for the benefit of Shining Light Foundation, Inc. and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).
