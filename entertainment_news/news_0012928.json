Strong yet gentle, the line specially designed for Maybelline New York, was an attempt to define today and tomorrow with designer duo’s signature geometric patterns dominating throughout. \n“Our collection was for the young and energetic women, who have their own mind, it was specially designed for Maybelline keeping New York and the busy life in mind. ”The collection was for everyone, who are working, taking care of home, covering fashion weeks and then partying as well.It is for our multitasker powerful girls,” Rahul told reporters. The collection that opened up with ladders and lines in the backdrop started with a subtle white shining on the ramp. \nWith “Hold On” by SBTRKT Feat Sampha playing in the background, the colour palette made a swift switch from fluorescent mints to grey to coral to black and silver. Bollywood starlet Athiya Shetty, who is also the new face of Maybelline, turned the showstopper for the designers and looked sensuously pretty in silvery white floor length dress with diamond shaped back cut and silver stilettos. \nThe 22-year-old, who was walking the ramp for the second time in Delhi, completed her look with light wavy hair, fresh make up and a velvet matte pout. ”I was initially nervous to walk the ramp, but the energy here was amazing and there were positive vibes. This was my ‘Make it Happen’ moment for me. I became confident and comfortable in my skin. For me it was just about being happy and enjoying the moment,” Athiya said. The designers were all excited with the newbie walking for them and said she made their collection look better. \n“Athiya beautifully carried the dress and her energy on the ramp brought the whole show together,” they said. The designs were comfortable yet trendy. Use of checks and stripes was prominent in the collection with sequins bringing the slight bling and New York influence alive. With clothes ranging from shorts to ankle length trousers, broad bottom pants, dresses and crop tops the collection presented by the duo was suave, sophisticated with sharp cuts. Renowned make-up artist Elton J Fernandez dolled up the models and the showstopper in a fresh look with emphasise on lips and eye brows. \nDaughter of veteran actor Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, Riddhima Kapoor Sahani and her businessman husband Bharat Sahani made it to the front row along with many popular faces of Delhi social circuit. \nModified Date: October 11, 2015 1:39 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:11:56.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
