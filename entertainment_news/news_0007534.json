In the promos, the 46-year-old comedian jokes about having memory loss from a tragic car accident he was involved last year. In the clip, Tracy jokes to castmate Bobby Moynihan that he doesn't remember about being a regular cast on \"SNL\" in the past. \"Did I used to work here?\" Tracy asks Bobby, to which he replies, \"Yes, Tracy. You worked here for like seven years.\" Tracy says, \"I can't remember anymore.\" After Bobby apologizes to Tracy, Tracy laughs and says, \"I'm messing with you, Bobby. I remember everything. I remember you owed me $72.\" In the second take, Tracy jokes about getting \"everyone in the building pregnant\" while promoting the show featuring musical guest Demi Lovato . Bobby is happy that his fellow castmate is back like his old self, saying, \"That's our Tracy.\" Tracy was a cast member on \"SNL\" from 1996 to 2003. He returned to the stage at the Emmys last month after the tragic car accident. He received a standing ovation while giving an emotional speech at the event, thanking his family and doctors for support. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:14:16.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
