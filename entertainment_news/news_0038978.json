After her character Chanel #2 was killed off earlier in the freshman season, it's hard to imagine how she would be brought back, but it's apparently not impossible on the show. Now, fans can get a glimpse of Grande's return as Chanel #2 in a preview for the upcoming outing. The promo video also teases an arrest of Dean Cathy Munsch ( Jamie Lee Curtis ), a murder plot and a funeral. An official synopsis for \"Beware of Young Girls\" also reveals how Grande's Chanel #2 will be part of the storyline. In an attempt to determine who the Red Devil killer is, the Kappas use a Ouija board to communicate with Chanel #2 from beyond the grave and learn of a wicked plot against one of their own. Meanwhile, Dean Munsch is left in a desperate situation when a shocking event leads her to come face-to-face with her ex-husband's mistress. \"Scream Queens\" will take a-week break and return with the new episode Tuesday, November 3 at 9/8c on FOX. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:53:01.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
