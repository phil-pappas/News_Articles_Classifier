While chatting with that night's guest Snoop Dogg , the hip-hop mogul revealed that he'd been dreaming to play a string of European shows that he'd call \"Beats & Rhymes\" tour. \"One of my dreams right now is to be able to take my ideas and take a show over to Europe,\" said Dre. \"I'm 30 years in the game right now and I've never been able to take my full production over to Europe. Me and Snoop - we've been over there. Me and Eminem have been over there, but it's just been spot dates and taking a microphone over there with a DJ.\" \"I've never had the opportunity to take the full production over there, and take my full body of ideas over there and present it to all the people over there in Europe that's been representing and showing me love throughout my entire 30-year career,\" he continued. Dre, however, didn't wan't to hit the road alone. During his show, he also revealed his dream line-up that included Snoop, Em and Kendrick Lamar . \"I want it to be me and Snoop. I want it to be Eminem. I want it to be Kendrick Lamar,\" he shared. \"Do a tour over in Europe and call it 'Beats & Rhymes' and take our full production over there and take our full stage over there and show Europe the same amount of love that they been showing me throughout my entire career,\" he summarized. \"So, that's my dream. Hopefully we can make that happen.\" After Dre explained the hypothetical tour's title, Snoop suggested a different title. \"Your dream sounds like Woodstock on steroids. Let's call it Hoodstock,\" he said. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:41:20.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
