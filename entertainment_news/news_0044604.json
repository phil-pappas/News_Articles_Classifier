Even while the Catholic Secular Forum (CSF) is protesting against the piece being staged and its future is uncertain, this riveting story, which is very difficult in parts to watch, is one that absolutely needs to be told. Written by American playwright John Pielmeier in 1982, the play is said to be based on a true story. A young nun, Sister Agnes (Avanti Nagral), is accused of killing her newborn child. The court appoints psychiatrist Dr Martha Livingston (Anahita Uberoi) to determine the nun's mental stability. But she faces fierce opposition from the Mother Superior (Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal) of the convent, who will do anything to protect Agnes and the church from a scandal.\nWas the child a result of Immaculate Conception? Or did someone father it? As the play attempts to answer these questions, it throws light on the age-old debate â€”science versus faith. After The Vagina Monologues, Mahabanoo is back on stage with another commanding performance. Her character, though not instantly likeable, is one that stays with you because you sympathise with her and understand her dilemma. She puts the spotlight on the inner struggle (when to be pragmatic and when to believe in the spiritual) that someone in her position would experience. Meanwhile, her nemesis Dr Livingston, played by Anahita, goes through a gamut of emotions. A staunch atheist, she is stern and business-like while dealing with her patient initially. Eventually, as the story progresses, she invests herself so deeply in the case that she starts thinking about the possibilities of miracles.\nAnahita's character undergoes the biggest transformation and deepest introspection and is, by no means, an easy one to essay. While the above two are seasoned actors, it's Avanti who comes as a surprise. She makes her stage debut with the play. She portrays the role of the beautiful and tormented soul Agnes with such vulnerability and innocence that your heart goes out to her and you want to protect this child-woman, even though she has been suspected of murdering a baby! Her angelic face, coupled with her ethereal singing skills, lend her character a haunting quality. Director Kaizaad Kotwal has ensured that the pace of this drama is quick, so that it doesn't lag behind in places, even in the most heavy-duty scenes. Despite being such a grave story, he manages to add some humour; these light moments are the occasional banter between Mother Superior and Dr Livingston.\nAgnes of God should not be dismissed as a story on religion as that will just be scratching the surface. At its core, it's also about physical abuse, mental health, human relationships and rediscovering oneself. Heart-wrenching performances apart, this is a compelling theatrical creation mainly because of its gripping writing and it shouldn't be missed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:43:43.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
