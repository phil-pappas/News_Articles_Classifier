Addressing the peace conference, Singh expressed disappointment over the brutal murder of 50-year-old Mohammed Akhlaq and urged the youth to beware of the vicious trap prepared by communal forces. \nThe District Magistrate announced that he would be visiting each and every village and address the youngsters between the age of 18 to 30. Terming it an ‘ideological surgery’, Singh said it is necessary to take such initiatives in order to protect the nation from those who want to divide it on the lines of religion.

But any organisation that talks about dividing the nation, talks about dividing the society on religious lines…they are desh-drohi, not wise,” the DM added. \nSingh repeatedly urged those present in the peace meeting to stop paying heed to rumours and provocative appeals made by fringe groups. “If you give others the permission to set a fire, you will turn to ash. I want to make you aware of this,” he said. \nExpressing disgust over the actions of the frenzied mob, Singh said, “Do you want to take this country back to the Stone Age? If someone is committing a crime, I am not saying they should not be punished. But, you do not have the right to give punishments. (This right) is with the system that you have made. This is a democracy, the system is yours, no one else’s.” \nThe meeting was attended by members of both Hindu and Muslim community. Akhlaq’s brothers Jan Mohammed and Afzal Saifi were also present along with Bisara village chief Sanjay Rana. \nModified Date: October 8, 2015 9:02 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:06:01.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
