They were subsequently forced to shut down speculation infidelity was to blame for the break-up, and Shelton has since insisted he is \"in a good place\" and \"loving\" life. \nHowever, that hasn't stopped In Touch Weekly editors from running articles about the alleged turmoil that led to the couple's divorce, with one cover story in the publication's September 28 issue carrying the headline, \"Rehab for Blake... He Finally Hits Rock Bottom\". \nThe accompanying piece suggested Shelton's \"drinking and womanizing... helped torpedo his 4-year marriage\", while his so-called friends were reportedly \"terrified he could end up dead at this rate\". \nShelton has now filed suit against publishers at Bauer Media in Los Angeles County Superior Court in a bid to protect his reputation. He has denied all accusations, insisting he isn't in rehab and has no plans to seek any professional treatment, and is seeking at least $2 million in damages, according to TMZ.com. \nIt's the first tabloid report Shelton has taken issue with - he previously reached out to pal Chris Young to apologize after reports suggested he was Lambert's secret lover, while he also recently laughed off speculation he has moved on to date his The Voice co-star Gwen Stefani, who split from her husband Gavin Rossdale in August. \n\"Getting ready this morning to go put in my deer plots and looked at Twitter...,\" he wrote last month. \"Damn my dating life is awesome!! Let me know what happens...\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:12:09.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
