To a large extent, that's due to the snobbery with which the fashion industry views reality TV, and the age requirements for contestants (18+ in the United States, though lower in some international versions of the show) mean many promising new faces would already have locked up development deals with big agencies long before they could audition.\n Yes, OK, there's also the fact that at the end of the day, Top Model is a TV show designed to entertain! If the crazed contestants happen to be hella modelesque (or even a little bit modelesque, really) that's a bonus, but it was certainly not ever a casting requirement. But that doesn't mean the show hasn't featured contestants who've gone on to major successes in the modeling business — and it's worth noting that the term \"top model\" is a vague and relative one these days. You're not going to find a modern-day supermodel often, period, let alone one prepared for Tyra's zany makeovers and catwalk stunts. But take the term to mean a girl (or guy!) who books regular gigs on major runways, editorials in major magazine, and even the odd campaign and, look, the Top Model franchise has found some stars! Seriously! See 12 examples below, and write some apologetic messages to Tyra on Tyra Mail stationery please:\n 1. Kate Grigorieva , Russia's Next Top Model\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Karwai Tang / WireImage / courtesy of Numero Now a Victoria's Secret Angel and regular on fashion week's biggest runways, Grigorieva appeared on the fourth cycle of Russia's Next Top Model in 2012 and eventually placed second, but let's not dwell on that (especially because the show's winner went, well, nowhere). She just got married this a few months back, and it was stunning .\n2. Patricia van der Vliet , Holland's Next Top Model\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Michael Stewart / Getty Images; courtesy of Vogue Netherlands After placing fourth on the fourth season of Holland's Next Top Model in 2008, all the show's judges apparently said van der Vliet should have won. (As it happened, the Dutch public voted in the finale.) She debuted on a bunch of big-stakes fashion runways a few seasons later, undeterred, and remained a runway mainstay for years, also landing a spot in the prestigious Models.com top 50 for a while. Van der Vliet also booked a Vogue China cover in 2010.\n3. Aamito Lagum , Africa's Next Top Model\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Catwalking / Getty Images; via Instagram / aamito_lagum Lagum won the first cycle of Africa's Next Top Model — which featured contestants from across the whole continent — at the beginning of 2014. So while she's still building out a big-leagues top-model career, all the omens are good, by which I mean that she is beyond beautiful, landed a nod as one of the fall 2015 season's best runway newcomers, and is shooting editorials in all of the cool fashion magazines.\n4.
