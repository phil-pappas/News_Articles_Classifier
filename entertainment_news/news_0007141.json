She could have faced up to a year behind bars, but the Associated Press reports that prosecutors have decided not to charge her with any crime.\nProsecutors said there wasn't enough evidence to convict her of any crime. However, she still faces two lawsuits from the family of the deceased driver, Kim Howe. Howe's stepchildren have accused Caitlyn of being negligent and causing the family \"great losses.\" Caitlyn is reportedly contesting a wrongful death lawsuit brought on by the stepchildren, arguing that they were never close to Howe and never relied on her for money.\n \"We believed from the start that a thorough and objective investigation would clear Caitlyn of any criminal wrongdoing,\" Blair Berk, Caitlyn's lawyer, told the Associated Press. \"We are heartened the district attorney has agreed that even a misdemeanor charge would be inappropriate. A traffic accident, however devastating and heartbreaking when a life is lost, is not necessarily a criminal matter.\"\nFollow Megan on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/megancarol", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8362f7df312a4d1e97e506a700304c64/prosecutors-decline-charge-caitlyn-jenner-fatal-crash", "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-caitlyn-jenner-manslaughter-case-now-in-da-s-hands-20150825-story.html"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:02:19.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
