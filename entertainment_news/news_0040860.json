The concierge of crime, Raymond \"Red\" Reddington (James Spader), has always had an inexplicable soft spot for her. The sneak peek pictures and promos don't lie; Liz will dye her hair blonde in order to evade the FBI. In her desperation, she'll also turn to a surprising source for help that even Red advises her not to trust. Get ready to learn a lot more about the mysterious Red, now that he'll call on all of his shady resources and contacts to help Liz. When he calls someone and says, 'I need to travel,' and they get into a little silver van and drive off, what happens? Tom Keen (Ryan Eggold): Last we saw Liz's erstwhile fake husband, he had sailed off into the sunset, seeking a life of his own after working undercover for years on end. \"In their own unique ways, their feelings for Liz, their desires to help Liz would naturally bring them into conflict,\" Eisendrath says. Aram (Amir Arison): The computer specialist will be as instrumental as ever, but he will feel very reluctant to turn on Liz, someone he still implicitly trusts. Samar (Mozhan Marno): The former Mossad agent is fully dedicated to the FBI and its manhunt, but a face from the past will dredge up horrifying memories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:19:11.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
