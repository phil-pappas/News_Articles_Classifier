ROBERT FREEMAN/AP McCartney, Lennon, and Harrison were in a band together during their teens before forming the Beatles with Ringo. Previous Next Enlarge Life happened, but he had better plans.\nThe former Beatle, who would have been 75 years old on Friday, had many plans — from continuing a solo musical career to life with wife Yoko Ono and large-scale activism.\nStrikingly different then his former bandmates, the rebellious English singer and songwriter jumped into frequent political protests and is now known for his dream of peace as much as he is for his music.\nSo much so that on Tuesday, two thousand fans gathered in Central Park and formed a peace sign in his honor.\nAlmost 35 years ago, Lennon’s life was cut short at 40 years old on Dec. 8, 1980 outside his Upper West Side apartment — in a city where he had coincidentally moved to live a private life.\nTo remember the music icon’s life, here are some little known facts for fans to enjoy:\n1. Lennon was raised by his aunt Finding her sister an unfit parent, Lennon’s aunt, Mimi Smith, raised him.\nThe boy stayed with Smith and her husband — who had no children of their own — and had frequent visits from his mother.\nHis often-absentee father tried to take custody of a young Lennon but it didn’t work.\n2. His mother taught him how to play the banjo Through visits with his mother, Julia, he learned to play the banjo and she gave him his first guitar in 1956.\nMimi Smith once told Lennon: \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.\"\n3. He wouldn’t have contact with his father for 20 years Lennon lost touch with his father when he was five years old. Their reunions afterwards were brief and usually upsetting.\nOn his feelings towards his father, the musician once told journalist Hunter Davies \"it was like he was dead .”\nAnnie Leibovitz/AP Lennon, who was the first person on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine, appears here with Yoko Ono.

He was a troublemaker At one point, while in a college class, he sat on a nude model’s lap during a drawing class.\n6. The Quarry Men was Lennon’s precursor to the Beatles It was a skiffle group that Lennon formed at the age of 15.\nIt featured Paul McCartney and George Harrison.\n7.

He was the only Beatle who wasn’t a vegetarian McCartney and Harrison were vegetarians for spiritual reasons while Ringo Starr turned to the meatless diet for his health.\nLennon, however, didn’t mind chowing down on some meat.\n9. He was the last Beatle to learn to drive He received his driver’s license at 24-years-old but that didn’t mean he was a good driver.\nLennon officially gave up driving when he wound up with 17 stitches after totaling his car in 1969.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:07:50.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
