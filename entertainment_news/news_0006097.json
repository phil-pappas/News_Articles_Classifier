Webster St.; ends at 1520 N. Loomis St.\nWho: Benefits Bike Bald\nCost: $10 for individual riders or nonriders to tour the grounds of the mansion at 1520 N. Loomis; $20 for families of any size\nInfo: bikebald.com Transform into a chap or dame from the 1940s or earlier, step atop a bicycle and take a ride to learn about Naperville history -- that's the pitch Bike Bald founder Debbie Mossburg is making as she encourages residents to participate in the fundraising ride.\nIndividual riders can sign up for $10 and families with any number of members can participate for $20. All funds go toward Mossburg's all-volunteer organization Bike Bald , which provides emotional support for children with cancer by sending them birthday gifts and providing dream experiences.\n\"This is a great opportunity for kids and families to dress in period clothing and learn about our city,\" Mossburg said about the historically themed ride. Riders who don a costume from the 1940s or earlier can participate in the best-dressed chap and dame contest. Grand Marshal Julie Chirico will help judge the contest as one small way of supporting all of cancer survivor Mossburg's efforts to help youngsters battle the disease.\n\"I admire all the work she is doing to support children who are fighting cancer,\" Chirico said. \"She pours her heart into it and her own personal funds and she works so hard.\"\nSince Bike Bald opened a physical headquarters in September, the organization has been sending about 200 packages each week of toys, handmade gifts, crafts, art supplies and gift cards to kids and teens with cancer. Mossburg says the gifts help the kids, who are typically between 3 and 12 years old, persevere through a phase that's tough physically and emotionally.\n\"It's a pretty crucial time in their life,\" Mossburg said. \"They're getting minimal school time due to battling cancer.\"\nCycling events throughout the year are Bike Bald's main fundraising mechanism, and the Tweed Ride focuses on history. Riders will meet at Porter Avenue and Webster Street behind the Naper Settlement for a ride expected to last 45 minutes, including up to seven stops with information about the city's past.\nBryan Ogg, curator of research for Naper Settlement, will be the historical tour guide, riding at the front of the bike procession in a Ford Model T and stepping out at each stop to share stories.\nRiders will learn about the original settlement of Naperville in 1831, downtown business development over time, Central Park, North Central College, the railroad, the historic district, World War I, the former Kroehler furniture manufacturing plant and the \"K-Town\" neighborhood nearby and the Saybrook subdivision developed by influential Naperville builder Harold Moser.\nThe final stop will be the home of Bike Bald supporters Adam Stachowiak and Mike Isaac, who donated an underused workshop in a professional building they own to become the Bike Bald headquarters at 3380 Lacrosse Lane, Suite 100B.\nStachowiak and Isaac's home is known by some as the Case Mansion, by others as the Bauer Mansion. Either way, it's the stately seven-bedroom home at 1520 N. Loomis St. Riders will be able to tour its grounds, step onto the porch and see the architectural features including original doors, floors, moldings and stained glass.\n\"I've been doing more and more research and finding out more and more history about it, but I think I've just scratched the surface,\" Stachowiak said about the historic home built in 1905 or 1906. \"There's only been three other owners of the house and nobody changed anything significant.\"\nNonriders also are welcome to stop by the mansion at 1 p.m. and see the grounds and architecture for a $10 donation, Mossburg said. Also on the property will be a vintage afternoon tea celebration with teas from Argo Tea and sweets from Smallcakes and Nothing Bundt Cakes.\n\"People can bring a picnic,\" Mossburg said. \"We'll have blankets laid out on the grounds.\"\nRiders are expected to arrive at the mansion about 1:15 to complete the ride after traveling on Webster, Jefferson, Washington, Benton and Loomis streets.\nRelated Article\nNaperville childhood cancer support group opens new space Related Article\nNaperville survivor rides against childhood cancer Related Article\n'Superhero' shirts to honor Naperville's Pat Pradel News Health Naperville Charities and Fundraising Health & Fitness", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://www.bikebald.com/rides---events-2.html", "http://napersettlement.org/", "http://www.bikebald.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:21.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
