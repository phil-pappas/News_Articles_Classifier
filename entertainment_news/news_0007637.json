Singer has been defending Cosby in a lawsuit filed by Judy Huth, a Riverside County woman who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion around 1974. \nNo reason for the change is stated in the court filing. \nSinger says his firm is also being replaced on a defamation lawsuit filed by model Janice Dickinson against Cosby. \nThe development was first reported Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times.
