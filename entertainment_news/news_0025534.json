This is exciting news for fans of the show because Season 2 didn't end so well, and viewers didn't think the reality show would get another chance. None of the three couples in Season 2 stayed together, and two couples from Season 1 stayed together. Perhaps the third season will be a charm for \"Married at First Sight,\" according to People on Tuesday.\nInternational Business Times reported that there will be a new location to see if there will be better results from the social experiment in a different place. Last season's couples were selected from the New York area to be a part of the show, but this season couples will be selected from Atlanta. Other than a new location, the episodes will also be a little longer. The show used to be just an hour long, but the upcoming season's episodes will be extended to an hour and 15 minutes each.\n\"Married At First Sight\" is a social experiment with three couples picked by four specialists that include sexologist Dr. Logan Levkoff, psychologist Dr. Joseph Cilona, sociologist Dr. Pepper Schwartz and spiritual advisor Greg Epstein. \"Married at First Sight\" follows the six singles who agree to marry after meeting for the first time at the altar. After four weeks of living together, the couples will decide if they want to stay married or get divorced.\nDespite no couple staying married from Season 2, two couples from Season 1 remain together and are currently starring on a spinoff show, \"Married At First Sight: The First Year\" Season 2, which premiered on Oct. 13. Viewers will see what is going on in the marriages of Cortney Hendrix and Jason Carrion and Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner. Watch the two-hour season premiere of \"Married at First Sight\" on Dec. 1 at 9 p.m. on FYI and A&E.", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.com/married-first-sight-season-3-feature-atlanta-cast-longer-episodes-2149219", "http://www.people.com/article/married-first-sight-returns-season-3"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:56:07.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
