The 31-year-old pop singer treated the crowd to her two inspiring singles \"Firework\" and \"Roar\" at the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines. Katy wore a white strapless dress complete with a Star-Spangled Banner cape. She was introduced by Bill Clinton. \"I've never been the warm-up act for Katy Perry before, but I am well aware that I am the warm-up act,\" the former president said. \"I stand and I march with Hillary. I believe in her future, her vision. I believe in her policies. I believe in equal rights for men, women, pay,\" the chart-topping singer explained why she supported the Democratic presidential candidate. Katy Perry also took over Hillary Clinton's Instagram. She posted a selfie with the female politician and showed her Hillary-inspired nails and a POTUS necklace she purchased as a birthday gift for her. Hillary is turning 68 on October 26, a day after Katy's own 31st birthday.
