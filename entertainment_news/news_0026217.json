As a result, musicians continue to make more money touring than they do distributing their music online. \nWith the partnership between Deezer and BandPage, listeners will be notified when artists they stream the most are performing nearby. BandPage CEO J Sider says testing has shown that targeting these messages carefully can vastly improve response rates. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
