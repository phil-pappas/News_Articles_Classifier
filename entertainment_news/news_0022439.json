There is the debonair Gomez, a black-clad Morticia snipping the heads off flowers, Uncle Fester making a light bulb glow by putting it in his mouth and daughter Wednesday torturing her brother Pugsley on a rack. \nDon't forget about the looming, gloomy Lurch and the hairy Cousin Itt. \nAnyone familiar with the 1960s sitcom \"The Addams Family\" or the 1990s movies based on the TV show will recognize the familiar characters in \"The Addams Family Musical,\" which opens Friday at Civic Theatre. \n\"I like to start the season with a bang,\" says Civic Artistic Director William Sanders. \"I hadn't seen the show but when I read the script it was very funny. It's a show that is Halloween-themed and also has a lovely message about family and acceptance and learning to embrace each other's differences.\" \nThe show draws most of its inspiration from cartoons drawn by Charles Addams for The New Yorker magazine, beginning in 1938. For most of the mid 20th century, the Addams Family appeared in single panel cartoons as an unnamed family that delighted in the macabre. The kids used a tiny guillotine on a doll and kept the family's pet bats in a bird cage. The joke was that they were blissfully unaware that they were unusual. \nIn 1964, a television series based on the cartoon characters —with its finger-snapping opening theme — introduced the world to this weird clan. The family went on to star in an animated series and in two popular films in the 1990s. \n\"Some will remember the TV show, but because of movies there is another sense of recognition that goes across generations,\" Sanders says. \"The show is very family-friendly.\" \nIn the musical's storyline, Wednesday Addams is grown up — 18 — and she has fallen in love with a \"normal\" boy from Ohio. When she confides in her father, Gomez must do something he's never done before — keep a secret from his beloved wife. When Wednesday invites her boyfriend's straight-laced family over to the family's forbidding mansion to announce their engagement, all kinds of craziness ensues. \nThe music and lyrics are by Andrew Lippa, who was nominated for a Tony for his work on \"The Addams Family.\" He also wrote the music and lyrics for Broadway's \"The Wild Party\" and contributed songs to \"You're A Good Man Charlie Brown,\" for which he was nominated for a Grammy. \nThe musical ran on Broadway 2010-2011 and was nominated for two Tony Awards. \nSanders says he knew immediately he wanted Jarrod Yuskauskas, who just played Horace Vandergelder in Muhlenberg Summer Theatre's \"Hello Dolly!\" and played the title role in Civic's \"Young Frankenstein\" last year, as Gomez Addams. \n\"He's one of the most versatile actors in the Lehigh Valley,\" Sanders says. \"He's very talented.\" \nSanders says Mariah Dalton, last seen on Civic's stage in \"Urinetown\" in 2014, \"absolutely had the essence of Morticia\" when she walked in to the audition. \nThe rest of the cast \"just showed up,\" Sanders says. \"This show has a real following.\" \nThe young man cast as Uncle Fester had to withdraw at the last minute and Sanders asked Andrea Cartagena, who had been cast as Grandmama, Gomez's cynical mother, if she was interested in the role. He says the gender of Fester is somewhat ambiguous. Cartagena was thrilled with the idea. \n\"She gets the trouper of the year award for shaving her head,\" Sanders says. \"I did not ask her to or expect her to but she went full Fester.\" \nMarie Ann Sutera, who had been in the ensemble, was tapped to play Grandmama. \nSanders says the score is really fun and features a variety of genres. \nWednesday, played by Emilie Leyes, gets to belt out a big pop Broadway song in \"Pulled,\" while Gomez's numbers are Latin-infused and Fester's songs are pure vaudeville. \nAnd it wouldn't be the Addams family without a sexy tango between Gomez and Morticia, \"Tango de Amour.\" \nThere is a 14-piece orchestra led by musical director Steve Reisteter. \nThe show opens in a graveyard (of course) and the family is joined by the Addams ancestors who serve as a sort of ghostly Greek chorus. \nSanders says in the Broadway show, the ancestors performed dance-heavy kick-line style numbers but in the Civic production they are more character-driven. \n\"They are supposed to be dead bodies coming back from the grave,\" he says. \"They do character movement, which I think is more interesting.\" \nHe says the dozen ancestors are mostly women, but he thinks their higher voices make their chorus numbers sound \"more angelic.\" \nSanders says costume designers Will Morris and Nina Reilly wanted to retain the classic look of the TV series. For example, Dalton as Morticia wears a long black gown that is very tight at the bottom and makes it difficult for her to do any elaborate dancing. \nAs a result, the tango between Gomez and Morticia is less the showy \"Tango Argentino\" style and more about the relationship between the couple, Sanders says. \nThe look of the show is as you'd expect — dark and gloomy, Sanders says. \nHe says designers used the line \"you have to see the world in shades of gray\" from the song \"When You're An Addams\" as inspiration. However the family of Wednesday's boyfriend provides a pop of color. \nNew York set designer Ann Beyersdorfer has created a series of rolling set pieces that move on and off stage to take the family from their creepy mansion to the graveyard and back. \nAlso in the cast of 23 are Jordan King as Cousin Itt, Logan McCabe as Lurch, Christian Clausnitzer as Pugsley, Thomas Riley as Wednesday's boyfriend Lucas, Rob Clausnitzer as Lucas' father Mal and Alyssa Haning as his mother Alice. \n610-778-2235 \n'THE ADDAMS FAMILY MUSICAL' \n• What: Broadway musical based on the Charles Addams' cartoons for The New Yorker magazine and the popular 1960s sitcom about the creepy family: Morticia, Gomez, Lurch, Fester, and Wednesday and Pugsley. \n• When: Friday through Oct. 25 \n• Where: Civic Theatre, 527 N. 19 t h St., Allentown \n• How much: $20-$31 \n• Show times: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Saturday, Oct. 15, 16, 17, 22, 23 and 24; 2 p.m. Oct. 18 and 25 \n• What else: Ladies night is Oct. 15.
