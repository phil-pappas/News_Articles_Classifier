So don't confuse me with those food show guys (although my classic car is cooler than the one that other guy on Food Network has) but I do like to eat. \nI'm just the sports columnist at the Enquirer and that means I've eaten at a lot of different places while on the road covering games. So getting to sample some of the best food in the Battle Creek area seems like a good idea. I was able to trick the Enquirer into letting me do it, so here is Bill's Bites. \nIt's football season and it is the week of the Michigan State vs. Michigan game in college football. \nSo whether you bleed green or if you are true blue, the first thing you need when it comes to watching the big game is a big sandwich. If it's in your man cave or out tailgating on campus, you need a quality sub to make the experience perfect (and you need your team to win.) \nSo Bill's Bites is set to help you out this week as we visit BC Subs in the Lakeview area in Battle Creek. \nThe small sub shop featuring big sandwiches is a great place to pop in before kickoff for a two-handed companion to your favorite beverage, or just to grab a bite for lunch during the work day. \nAnd at Bill's Bites, we are always on the look-out for an over-the-top food item that will score with our appetite, so we were excited to see on the BC Sub menu a sandwich called the Everything. Bill's Bites visits BC Subs to get ready for the big game - getting The Everything sub with six meats and three cheeses before sitting down to watch Michigan State vs. Michigan Bill Broderick \nBest time to eat here is game time \nThe best way we like to spend a Saturday or a Sunday at Bill's Bites is sitting in the press box or in front of the TV for a football game with a big sandwich, piled high with meats and cheeses. \nAt BC Sub, they know how we feel. \nWith 28 subs on the menu (or 29, when you count No. 13 twice, which they do with No. 13x), BC Subs has nearly every sandwich you could hope for. Bill's Bites: Gull Meadow is the pick of the season \nBut at Bill's Bites, our playbook always says go big or go home, so we went big with the Everything — No. 20 on your BC Subs roster. \nThe Everything has six meats and three cheeses and is the biggest sandwich on the board. It features a hearty portion of meats, including mortadella, capicola, genoa, salami, bologna and ham. And if that isn't enough, it adds a stack of three cheeses, American, hot pepper and provolone. \nBill’s Bites enjoys the Everything sub sandwich at BC Subs, features six meats and three cheeses. (Photo: Bill Broderick/The Enquirer) \nThis is an unlock-your-jaw kind of sandwich, where you have to widen your stance, hunch your back, grab the Everything sub with two hands and just get after it. \nStarting with the meats, BC Subs isn't shy with the portions and, even though it is a blitz of cured pork products coming at you all at once with six different kinds, you can still taste the individual components. The spice of the Italian meats work well with the sweet and salty flavor of the ham and bologna. \nWith the cheeses, get the sandwich warmed up and you will get a melt of flavors that brings a richness to the party. The hot pepper cheese is a perfect accent to the trio. \nAdd nicely-shredded lettuce, thin-cut onion, tomatoes and Italian seasonings and you have a a sub that will get you to halftime and beyond. \nIf you like that kind of thing, this features variety \nYour franchise sub shops have a list of choices, but it doesn't extend to the 28 (or 29, as mentioned above) offered by BC Sub. Starting with the simple bologna and cheese for your little eaters and extending to the Everything, this sub shot almost literally has \"everything\" you could be looking for. \nThe breakdown includes several subs with one or two of the meats featured, including salami, genoa or mortadella, while also offering turkey, roast beef, corned beef, pastrami and even tuna. \nEach of the subs come in a small or a large and any of the combinations can also be made into a wrap, with your choice of honey wheat, spinach, tomato or garlic herb tortilla wraps. \nBut it doesn't stop at sandwiches and wraps. This small sub shop, snug in its spot in a strip mall in the downtown Lakeview area, has a surprisingly big menu that also includes a dozen different salads, several grilled sandwiches like the Reuben and a gyro, and even BBQ pork. \nAs a sports guy, this food reminds me of \nWilliam \"The Refrigerator\" Perry \nBC Subs logo (Photo: Bill Broderick/The Enquirer) \nWilliam \"The Refrigerator\" Perry was an iconic football player for the Chicago Bears in the 1980s and 1990s, who burst on to the national sports landscape in 1985 as \"Da Bears\" were heading to the Super Bowl. He comes to mind because we are talking football this week, but also because his nickname came from the fact that he was as big as a refrigerator. \nThe Everything sub at BC Subs fits this description. It is one of the biggest subs available anywhere and includes just about everything you can find in your refrigerator. \nI'm not a food critic, but if you asked me I'd describe this by saying this is game-changer \nThe sandwiches at BC Sub aren't your everyday $5 subs. This is a game-changer in terms of what you decide to grab on your way to the football tailgate or what you have on your armrest as you sit in front of the TV to settle in and watch your favorite team. Made with love by the same people who have done it for years at BC Sub, they know how to do your sandwich right. \nAnd if you get the Everything, which is big enough for any appetite, and with the kind of variety to stay interesting until the scoreboard reaches zero, you will feel like your choice in sandwiches made you a winner, even on days when your choice in teams may not. \nBill Broderick can be reached at bbroderi@battlecreekenquirer.com or 269-966-0678.
