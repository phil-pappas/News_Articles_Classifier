An online campaign called #ProfileForPeace won hearts and received tremendous response across the border with thousands of citizens of both the country changing their profile and sending love notes to each other to douse the fire of hatred. Riled by these recent incidents of Pakistani artistes being banned in the country, 36-year-old Mumbai-based Ram Subramanian, an activist, started the #ProfileForPeace campaign on Facebook. His online campaign drew attention of many people on social media and people started changing their profile pictures with a love note. ”I am an Indian. I am from Mumbai. I don’t hate Pakistan. I am not alone. There are many people like me!” He made that his profile picture. Since Subramanian’s Facebook post went viral on social media thousands of Indians from Kerala to Kashmir and Pakistanis from Lahore to Karachi as well as those living in the US, UK and UAE have changed their profile picture with a short love note. ”It had been brewing in my head ever since I heard of a series of bans and attacks. Most of us common blokes don’t feel such hate nor want these fights. And when you close the doors to art you open up a door for dark and unwanted things to come in,” he was quoted by Times of India. #ProfileForPeace because only love can defeat politically-generated hatred!
