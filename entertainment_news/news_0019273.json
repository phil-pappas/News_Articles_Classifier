But it wasn't her behind the wheel - the vehicle was stolen weeks before.\nDenver news station KMGH-TV reported Monday ( http://tinyurl.com/ptu7rul ) that Melissa Gonzales got the ticket showing her 2014 Ford Explorer going 85 in a 45-mph zone on Sept. 15, about two weeks after it was taken from outside her home.\nShe hopes someone recognizes the four males in the photo, but she says it's a little upsetting to see them smiling.\nGonzales says her SUV also got a parking ticket and triggered a $9.20 toll in the Denver area last month. Both were mailed to her.\nShe says the paper trail makes it seem like whoever is driving wants to be found.\n KMGH-TV, http://www.thedenverchannel.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/ptu7rul"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:23:13.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
