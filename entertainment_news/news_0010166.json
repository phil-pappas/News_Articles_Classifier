Tomi Kilgore tells why on the News Hub. Photo: Getty on.aol.com In anticipation of its 50th anniversary in Chicago next year, the Tiffany & Co. store on 730 N. Michigan Avenue received a recent makeover. Inspired by the Fifth Avenue flagship shop, the Chicago branch sports a two-story granite façade with Tiffany Blue awnings and the company’s signature Atlas clock.\n“The corner of Michigan Avenue and Superior Street, where the Tiffany store resides, is at the heart of Chicago’s famous shopping boulevard,” notes Tiffany vice president Cathy Elward. “The major redesign we’ve made to our store reinforces the importance of our commitment to the Chicago market, as well as our wish to better serve current and prospective clients and tourists.”\nTo add to the milestone, Tiffany commissioned original artwork by Carlos Rolón/Dzine entitled Inner Shining (Tiffany Yellow) , which will be sold with 100% of the proceeds earmarked for the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art’s Teen Creative Agency program.\n“Through our partnership with Carlos Rolón/Dzine, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art and EXPO CHICAGO , Tiffany has created a dynamic way to share our beautifully designed new store with the community as we look ahead to celebrating Tiffany’s 50th anniversary in Chicago next year,” adds Elward.\nFor more information, visit www.Tiffany.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:05:15.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
