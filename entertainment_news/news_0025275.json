The boy was rushed to a hospital, where he died later that night.\nPolice subsequently arrested the boys' father, 25-year-old Michael Santiago, on a felony child endangerment charge. During a court hearing on Sunday, Assistant State's Attorney Joseph DiBella said that Santiago bought the gun off the street, kept it \"wrapped in pajama pants on top of the refrigerator\" and even showed the boy where the gun was.\n\"He kept the gun for protection because he was a former gang member who snitched on a gang member in a murder trial,\" the Chicago Tribune reported DiBella as saying in court. Santiago had told police about the gun in a videotaped confession, DiBella said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:13:39.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
