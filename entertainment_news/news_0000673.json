For many years, he prepared three meals a day for hungry offshore crews. With his chopping, dicing and stirring, he has perfected tantalizing dishes. Some of his most popular signature dishes are flank steak and baked salmon with cucumber sauce. \nEven though the flank steak only needs to be marinated 10 minutes, it cooks up juicy and tender. Using a sharp knife, slice it across the grain in thin pieces. The salmon can be baked up in a snap. Cucumber sauce makes a delicious must-have accompaniment to the salmon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:06:07.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
