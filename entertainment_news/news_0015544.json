Brett Wilson, who is chairman of Canoe Financial, says the two men got to know each other while at \"Dragons' Den\" — a TV program in which entrepreneurs seek money and advice from the so-called dragons. \nO'Leary — one of the original stars of the CBC reality TV show, on ABC's version \"Shark Tank,\" and a commentator on other business programs — will become vice-chairman of Canoe Financial under the agreement. \nAlthough O'Leary is the more prominent of the two businessmen because of his numerous TV appearances, his company manages a smaller base of assets and will bring Canoe Financial contracts representing $800 million in investment assets.
