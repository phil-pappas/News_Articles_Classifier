Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. \nThe actor's two-day Cyprus trip is his first since being appointed U.N. Global Advocate for the Elimination of Mines and Explosive Hazards. \n\"I've much hope that I will be the first and last global advocate to see land mines on this beautiful island,\" said Craig. \nTalks aimed at reunifying Cyprus as a federation are expected to ramp up next month as the two sides tackle the issues that still separate them. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:36:58.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
