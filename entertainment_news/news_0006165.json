(AP) - A cockatoo with the screech of a dinosaur is vexing residents of a tony Boston suburb.\nThe white bird, named Dino because of his annoying call, flew away from his owner in July and into the trees of Brookline.\nHe's been gnawing on the woodwork of the Nancy Gertner's historic home. Gertner is a retired federal judge and senior lecturer at Harvard Law School.\nThe Boston Globe reports ( http://bit.ly/1Ngk1dE ) animal control officials were called and no one will trap the bird.\nShe left food in a cage and a string to close the door. Dino refused the bait and squirrels ate the food. Loud rock 'n' roll music and a blaring house alarm failed to chase Dino away.\nGertner may have to make peace with Dino; she's run out of ideas to get rid of him.\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1Ngk1dE"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:55:45.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
