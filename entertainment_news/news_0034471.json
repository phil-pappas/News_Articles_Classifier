I was lucky enough to attend the Craig Siranni and Indira Siranni concert at the Dulles State Office Building Auditorium. From Opera to Broadway the world renowned singing sensation husband and wife enthralled the audience. Craig Siranni, a Watertown native is a celebrated tenor who has sung all over the world, he recently opened a voice studio in town where he coaches and teaches singing students who come from as far away as Quebec to work with him. He is that well known and that goo. Although not performing publicly much these days, Craig agreed to do this concert for DPAO, as he loves this charity and was coaxed by another highly accomplished Watertown native, Joe Rich, president of DPAO. Craig and Indira’s song book ranged from the beautiful operatic arias of Puccini to a fantastic duet/medley of Bernstein/Sondheim’s West Side Story. One of the treats of the show was the performance of two of Craig’s students, one current, and one former. Sahwn Uplaznik gave us a great version of an aria from Verdi’s Macbeth . He was poised, confident and has a powerful instrument for sure. Former student Maria Bufalini gave one of her best singing performances yet for the solo “The Life I Never Lived” from Sister Act. A perfect song for her, Maria delivered the song with great phrasing and the right amount of emotionality. She is going places. The concert would have been better without an intermission, especially since the venue offers no snacks, and no intermission beverages. Also less talking, especially in the first act would have sped up procedures. Stick to the amazing music and stellar voices. Still, it was a great experience and it is a great to have the opportunity to see world class artists, right here in our backyard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:26:30.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
