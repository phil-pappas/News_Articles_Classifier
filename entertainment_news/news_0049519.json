(Photo: Peter Kramer, AP)\n5 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENT EMAIL MORE NBC weather wonk Al Roker apologized Monday for covering the historic flooding in South Carolina by tweeting a selfie with his crew, all grinning beside a disabled car trapped in a washed-out road.\nThe tweeted picture, now deleted, showed Roker and his two-person camera crew, clad in rain gear, smiling widely as they prepared to \"report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina\" for NBC's Nightly News .\nBehind them, a small green-yellow car lay on its side in a shallow hole left by the collapse of the side of a road.\nRoker later said the woman who was driving that car got out safely. But the explanation came too late; outraged tweets soon appeared:\nThis selfie disgusts me. SC is not smiling over all they have lost @TODAYshow @alroker #SCStrong #PrayForColumbia pic.twitter.com/brFfd2LONR\n— Jessie Johnson (@jessiegour) October 5, 2015 Let's hope this is the last disaster selfie ever @alroker\nNo one else is smiling.\n http://t.co/1pI90BVoJv\n— Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) October 5, 2015 @alroker @NBCNightlyNews Al, your photo is extremely poor taste. We are devastated and you're smiling. Shame on you pic.twitter.com/katHhTKvxo\n— Chuck Crumpler (@czaned) October 5, 2015 Roker realized his mistake immediately, deleted the tweet and issuing apologetic new tweets.\nAbsolutely correct. I apologize for being insensitive. The woman in that car got out without injury. We Should not have been in the picture\n— Al Roker (@alroker) October 5, 2015 We came down to report and I offended those who lost so much. I am sorry\n— Al Roker (@alroker) October 5, 2015 What does this mean? Maybe nothing.\nVeteran broadcasters like Roker know better than to smile on camera while reporting tragedies, such as a mass shooting for instance. But maybe they forget the rules, and good manners, when goofing off with silly selfies on social media.\nRoker, by the way, has gotten into trouble with some of his tweets in the past. In 2013, he apologized for tweeting a \"low-blow\" slam at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for not closing the schools before a major snow storm, forecasting he'd be a \"one-term\" mayor. It didn't help that he misspelled the mayor's name.\nI knew this am @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCSchools would close schools. Talk about a bad prediction. Long range DiBlasio forecast: 1 term\n— Al Roker (@alroker) February 13, 2014 \"I will say, the one tweet I do regret in the heat — I'm very passionate about the weather,\" he said later on Today . \"I made a prediction that there would be only one term of his administration. I apologize for that. That was … a little below the line.\"\nUSA TODAY\nAl Roker apologizes for 'low-blow' Bill de Blasio tweet\n5 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1LejGsu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52b94483e874b78c0c47e1c73727a93b4a5a5094/r=500x372/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796522833250010-AP-TV-Roker-Marathon.jpg", "http://t.co/katHhTKvxo", "https://twitter.com/alroker/status/650853936614764544", "https://twitter.com/NYCMayorsOffice", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LejGsu&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/42317eb21b30fdd09eb9bcb5d3ce42f44438812f/c=0-78-2269-2347/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/02/14/1392400110000-462234607.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LejGsu", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8c571331b09f69e1329d9ab0de639c9084899690/c=7-0-1493-1117&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796522833250010-AP-TV-Roker-Marathon.jpg", "https://twitter.com/RyanMaue/status/650865730905214976", "https://twitter.com/alroker", "https://twitter.com/czaned/status/650829523466981377", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796522833250010-AP-TV-Roker-Marathon.jpg", "http://t.co/1pI90BVoJv", "https://twitter.com/NYCSchools", "https://twitter.com/TODAYshow", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrayForColumbia?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCStrong?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews", "https://twitter.com/alroker/status/650854521577545730", "https://twitter.com/jessiegour/status/651054844799791109", "https://twitter.com/alroker/status/433991168771096577", "http://t.co/brFfd2LONR", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LejGsu&text=Al%20Roker%20apologizes%20for%20%27insensitive%27%20smile%20in%20flood%20tweet&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:02:03.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
