However, insurers are yet to fully capitalize upon the transformative power of digital technology, and many are still struggling to develop digital strategies that align with their business objectives. The insurance industry recognizes the need to overhaul traditional business models, to capitalize on the advantages of digital technology and respond to the challenges of digital disruption.\n\nThe report discusses how insurers in different markets use digital technology in different business functions, including product development, sales and marketing, underwriting, claims management and customer services. It also discusses market trends, opportunities and challenges faced by insurers in the successful implementation of digital strategy.\n\nSummary \nTimetric's 'Insight Report: Digital Innovation in Insurance' provides detailed analysis of the adoption and contribution of digital technology to the insurance industry globally.

SaaS has the potential to support the full insurance business, but its use for core activities such as underwriting, fraud detection, claims and product development remains low. \n\n- Mobile technology can play a key role in helping insurers to manage claims, from helping customers to report first notifications of loss, to settlements. Mobile apps can be used to submit claims and required details, and allow customers to check claim statuses. Mobile devices' integrated cameras enable customers to take and upload pictures when submitting claims.\n\n- The global market for insurance telematics is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80.20% over 2013â€“2018, to reach 85.5 million subscribers in 2018. Rapid technological advancements, such as mobile applications to track driving behavior, reduce the cost of implementing and operating insurance telematics.\n\n- Wearable technology is set to transform the health insurance category. Insurers not only use wearable technology to assess risk using collected data, but also to create a new range of value-added services. Wearable technology also has the potential to help customers improve their health and detect abnormalities at an early stage.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3151927/ \n\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com \n \nFor more information: \nSarah Smith \nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com \nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com \nTel: +44 208 816 85 48 \nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com \n\nSOURCE ReportBuyer\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:02:38.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
