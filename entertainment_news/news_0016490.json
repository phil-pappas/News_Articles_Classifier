The media left a crucial piece of the story out. Eve-Angeline Mitchell New research has come out suggesting that cat owners are at higher risk of developing schizophrenia, due to their being carriers of the parasite, toxoplasma gondii . Of course, a report like that can cause a lot of fear, even if the reports actually talk about how low the risk is. In fact, your risk of contracting toxoplasma gondii from other sources is higher than your risk of getting it from your cat.\nThe Pacific Standard published an article discussing CBS' June headlines regarding the link between toxoplasma gondii and schizophrenia. We've suspected this link for awhile, but it's just recently that science has been able to more firmly establish it. There were two studies; one that showed that schizophrenic adults were more likely to have the parasite, and another that showed that schizophrenic adults were more likely to have had cats as children.\nWhat the CBS article didn't really mention, that Pacific Standard does, is that things like undercooked meat and gardening are two places where people are even more likely to pick up the parasite than their own pets. We know that undercooked meat can be a considerable health hazard, due to the risk of salmonella and E. coli poisoning. Toxoplasmosis is yet another reason to ensure that you're cooking your meat thoroughly before you eat it.\nAs far as gardening, the CDC says that eating unwashed vegetables can expose you to toxoplasma gondii, as well as just digging in the dirt. Wearing gloves is a good way to prevent blisters, but it can also help protect you against all manner of pathogens, including that parasite.\nCats make a great breeding ground for toxoplasma gondii, but they don't represent the biggest vector for it. This is especially true if your cats are indoor-only cats , because indoor-only cats aren't going to hunt infected animals, and they're a lot less likely to come into contact with the feces of an infected cat.\nBasically, the media sensationalized the story to a degree, and probably caused an unnecessary amount of fear in doing so. You can contract toxoplasmosis from sources other than cats, and some of those vectors are more common than cats.", "external_links": ["http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/research-gone-wild-crazy-cats", "http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/prevent.html", "https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/toxoplasmosis"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:24:15.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
