If convicted, the actor faces six months in jail.\nBeverly Hills police declined to identify the drug Stamos had allegedly taken before his arrest.\nThe charges come at a busy time for Stamos, 52, who is working on a reboot of \"Full House\" for Netflix and has a Fox sitcom, \"Grandfathered,\" which premiered on Sept. 29. The show centers on Stamos' character, who discovers he has a son and infant granddaughter he never knew about.\nStamos' publicist Matt Polk did not immediately return email and phone messages Thursday morning.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:16:51.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
