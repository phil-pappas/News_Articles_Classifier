This is how I felt when my grade-five learner at the school reported what the teachers told them today, September 30, 2015. No term reports were to be issued, they’ve been told by the teachers. This kind of reprisal against the school management body and parents was inevitable. Will the education authorities not step in now and stop the rot which can have fatal results ?\nA section of the divided Management Body of Amsai had caused a Limited Forensic Audit Report on school finances to be conducted early in the year. News of the damning findings was announced at a parents meeting held on February 21, 2015 at the school\nThat announcement resulted in a situation of unimaginable outbreak of thuggery, creating uncertainty about the safety of school children.\nEarlier in the week, some gun-toting individuals, apparently sympathetic to the Ousted School Governance Management Body (OSGM), had entered the school yard, manhandled one of the New School Governance Management (NSGM) directors and threatened to kill him. The meeting of May 09, 2015 was an emergency response to the latter incidence.\nBut this was not the first incidence of hooliganism occurring at the school. A week or so before one of the NSGM members had reported a case of abduction to SAPS, Orange Farm. But the case was not proceeded with because, typically of police practice these days, the docket got lost.\nThe upshot of this state of affairs led to the formation on an “Ad-hoc Parent’s Representative Committee” (PRC) on May 09, 2015.(Saturday)\nThe PRC was mandated to probe and report back to the parent constituency of Amsai Primary School the following:\n1. The declining state of safety and security at Amasai Primary School\n2. Which is the legitimate/rightful school governance management body at Amsai?\n3. What are the implications of the financial mismanagement expose?\n4. What are the probable causes of falling standards in learning out comes\n5. Verify claims that some of the teachers at Amsai Primary School are not qualified\n6. What prospects are there for parent involvement in matters of school governance?\nIn the course of its mandated activities the PRC obtained evidence that the abduction was in fact reported to the police although no further action was likely to follow since the docket had been lost.\nA memorandum expressing parents concern about the uncertainty of children’s safety at the school was submitted to the police by the PRC. There after audience with the school’s principal and HOD was held. This meeting produced confirmation that some of the teachers were indeed not qualified.\nWith the expectation of finding a speedy solution to the situation, the PRC enlisted the assistance of local SANCO and the Association of SGB. That move has not borne the expected fruits, with the result that teachers are now boldly tempering with our children’s right to a proper education. So, what do we do now? Resign ourselves to the fact that, for our children, a substantial proportion of\n2\nthis (learning) year has gone to waste. Even the GDE and Directorate of Independent schools have been unable to help.\nFor a better elaboration of the situation at Amsai Primary School, I am attaching hereto a copy of the PRC’S first attempt at reporting to parents. It was presented in the form of a Newsletter titled “in loco parentis”\nSome views and questions about Amsai\n· According to the OSGM, Amsai Primary School is a Section 21 Company\n· They also claim to have sole discretion in determining the school’s governance policy; and hiring criteria. (See paragraph headed: “unqualified teachers”-attachment)\n· In view of the fact that the “Amsai Primary School Section 21 Company” has no source of revenue to manage its operating costs, how valid is the claim that Amsai is an independent school? The evident truth is that they are wholly dependent on state subsidy.\n· They have not been able to pay teachers (its employees) ever since the state subsidy was held back. An independent entity should have been able to meet its cash flow obligation through its “independent sources of revenue”.\n· Our children have suffered the set-back of not receiving proper learning inputs due to the issue of not receiving payment.\n· The suspension was due to an Audit based report of financial mismanagement.\n· Is there no one out there to help our children out of this morass?\nSipho Xesha (Member of the Ad-hoc Parents Committee – Amsai Primary School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:06:31.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
