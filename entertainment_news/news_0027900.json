It closes there Nov. 29. \nIt then jumps to the Golden Theatre, with previews beginning Feb. 23. \nNyong'o (\"12 Years A Slave\") portrays a teenager who finds herself enslaved in a rebel compound during a bloody civil war in 2003 Liberia. \nA graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Nyongo's stage credits include playing Perdita in \"The Winter's Tale\" and Sonya in \"Uncle Vanya\" both at Yale Repertory Theater. \nThe Mexican-born Kenyan will next appear in the anticipated \"Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens\" and will voice a character in Jon Favreau's take on Disney's \"The Jungle Book.\" \n\"Eclipsed\" is be directed by Liesl Tommy.
