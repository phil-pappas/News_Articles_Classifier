The Oscar winner opened up to Extra about a cocktail-fueled night that ended with his best friend's wife, Cindy Crawford, crawling into bed with him by mistake. \n\"She's only human, let's face it,\" he deadpanned. \"She can't help herself!\" \n\"We had a couple of drinks and then couldn't go home,\" he continued, calling it \"one of the funnier drunken nights.\" \nHe added: \"She thought I was [her husband] Rande [Gerber] and I was wearing my boots and my jeans -- that's how drunk I was, I think -- and she hopped in bed. That was pretty funny.\" \nMore recently, however, his celebrations have been more subdued. Clooney and his wife, Ama l just celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary with a quiet dinner. \n\"What are you gonna do, shoot off fireworks? You know, sometimes you just go to dinner,\" he said. \"This is the paper anniversary. You don't want to go too crazy on the first [because] you've got a lot more to do.\"' \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
