The 17-year-old’s participation has been surprising. “People definitely didn’t expect me here. Just knowing that I’m 17 has shocked a lot of people. When I was approached, I knew that there are going to be a lot of arguments and fights in the house and I wondered if I will I be able to deal with all that at such a young age, but then I just decided to go for it.”\nRochelle Rao\nFormer Miss India and IPL anchor Rochelle Rao is entering the show with boyfriend Keith Sequira. She says, “People know me as an anchor. I want them to see the real me. Someone who really inspires me to do the show is my friend Gauhar.
