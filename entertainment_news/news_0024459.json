The American dollar is Ecuador’s actual legal tender (paper currency). For several years now, Ecuador has been running their own cryptocurrency alongside the U.S. Dollar and results have been extremely encouraging. \nBut perhaps not surprisingly, digitalcurrency is not just for kids. \nAll too often, when it comes to technology the millennials think they have the market cornered. \nAs with everything else marked by every generation, babyboomers currently retire at the rate of 10,000 per day and this will continue for the next foreseeable 19 years. \nBabyboomers also have the most liquid cash of all American age groups. Now that’s one heck of a statistic! \nBabyboomers are sitting on a great deal of cryptocurrency and they are determined to get it to market. It’s time for cryptocurrency holders to come out of the closet and shop for brokers. After all, the CFTC did not say that “bitcoin” would be the only tradeable / sellable cryptocurrency. The CFTC clearly said “bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies.” \nThe digital coin that opened the doors, is called ‘bitcoin’ and there are hundreds of other digital coins just as viable and ready to go to market that are generally referred to as “cryptocurrency.” \nBeing the first to open the doors, bitcoin became synonymous with cryptocurrency like band-aids became what everyone calls an adhesive bandage with a small gauze center. There are hundreds of companies selling adhesive bandages but people ask for a ‘band aid’ when they need a bandage – they don’t ask for a bandage by brand names. \nLet’s start with the expression “Federal Reserve.” Many think the Federal Reserve is part of or has something to do with the United States Government. It is not part of the U.S. Government. The idea of a national or central bank was spearheaded by Alexander Hamilton and in 1791 but it was established by a handful of families and a couple of British banks. \nAs the years passed and with the good counsel of public relations firms, the Federal Reserve began correcting its public image and began to describe itself as the nation’s ‘central bank.’ Its website now states that the Federal Reserve derives ‘its authority ‘ from Congress. \nAdditionally, most people still think currency is backed up by some kind of value like a troy ounce of gold or perhaps even silver. As I waited my turn in line at the bank, a discussion began among those waiting with me about the topic of cryptocurrency because it was flashed on a screen featuring new banking products worldwide. \nAs we all waited online, several were saying that what they knew of cryptocurrency was that it was “decentralized, governed by no one and backed by absolutely nothing.” Compared to the dollar of course which they claimed is “completely centralized, governed by bankers and the federal government and backed by gold.” \nI thought the bankers, well within earshot of the conversation would correct their prized banking customers – they did not. They discretely turned away to disguise their giggling. They were amused with how little their customers knew about currency and took no steps to educate them. \nFor those unfamiliar with the seventies, know that President Richard Nixon delisted the United States Dollar from the gold exchange in 1971. Other than by “sheer good will,” the U.S. Dollar has not been backed by anything since then nor is it now. \nOne of the most interesting things about the new digital currency (and one of the clearest reasons why the banking industry so resists it) is because cryptocurrency keeps its own ledger known as the blockchain. The public need not count on the honesty of banks or bank employees since digital coins constantly record any and all activity related to it. \nThat blockchain is a virtual accounting service that follows that coin from the moment of its birth until the day it is spent. It leaves little wiggle room for crafty accounting or outright theft. \nThere are thousands upon thousands of citizens throughout the world holding cryptocurrency right now and they generally wish to sell it. The first step towards the successful sale of cryptocurrency is choosing a recognized broker. \nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent agency of the US government created in 1974 that regulates futures and option markets. It does not however choose or recommend brokers. \nOn September 17, 2015 a press release went out from the CFTC office stating that Virtual money (cryptocurrency) would from that day forward be officially recognized as a commodity, just like crude oil or wheat. \nBy this action, the CFTC asserted its authority to provide oversight of the trading of cryptocurrency futures and options, which will now be subject to the agency’s regulation. In the event of wrongdoing, such as futures manipulation, the CFTC will be able to bring charges against those brokers/companies. \nIf a commercial entity wishes to negotiate cryptocurrency and wishes to operate a trading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives or futures, it will need to register as a swap execution facility or designated contract market, just like the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group. \nBut if an individual holding cryptocurrency wishes to get it on the market (start selling his or her cryptocurrency) a good derivatives commodities broker will be necessary. \nThe CFTC does not govern the trading of currency itself but if a contract is written related to a derivative of that cryptocurrency, that derivatives activity does fall under the CFTC’s jurisdiction. \nFor example, the CFTC does not govern the trading of dollars and yen itself. However, if someone comes in asking for a derivatives contract to “lock in” cryptocurrency at a particular price, that is an activity that the CFTC will oversee and regulate. \nFor all cryptocurrencies, if they have derivatives on those cryptocurrencies and to the extent that they have derivatives on any of those cryptocurrencies, any person in the world may choose to offer derivatives on those currencies (commodities) to U.S. Citizens. That is the kind of activity that the CFTC will regulate. \nIf an individual wishes to trade cryptocurrency derivatives, the recommendation is that he or she first secure the services of ‘an exchange.’ For most Americans, (retail customers) if they wish to trade derivatives on cryptocurrencies they must go to a CFTC registered exchange that offers that product. \nThe contract would be totally similar to a derivatives contract on any currency and written very much the same way one would write a contract to trade wheat, oil or gold. \nFirst visit the CFTC website. Under the orange banner there are grey tabs with white lettering. \nChoose the fifth tab from the left labeled “Industry Oversight.” Choose the second of its dropdown choices labeled “Trading Organizations.” \nOn that page to the far right under RELATED LINKS you will find DCMs, DCOs and SEFs. Choose DCMs and SEFs. \nIf you want to get your cryptocurrencies on the markets you need a ‘futures commission merchant.’ We are not bankers or brokers so we had to learn the CFTC website. \nThe CFTC website is available and the site has direct email addresses and phone numbers to help anyone that wants to take their digital dollars to market!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:08:51.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
