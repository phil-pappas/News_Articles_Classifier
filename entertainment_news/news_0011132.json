The crew spent three years training wolves for the movie.\nChina Film News said it has been replaced by \"Go Away Mr. Tumor,\" a romantic comedy about an optimistic woman coping with cancer.\nThe last Chinese submission to be nominated for best foreign language film was Zhang Yimou's 2002 film \"Hero.\"\nCopyright The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:03:44.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
