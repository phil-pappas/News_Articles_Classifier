At the first debate, a lot of those guys were competing for who could be the most politically correct. \"Trump says, 'Okay, I've supported Democrats, I've supported Republicans. Yeah, I used to be friends with Bill Clinton. Who cares? I run things and I've built things. You need somebody who can go in there and fix it.
