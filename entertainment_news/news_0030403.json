The event partly benefits Career Gear, a not-for-profit organization that helps men who are re-entering the workforce. As part of the campaign, Defy’s Made Man lifestyle destination will run several original video series. The content is aimed at encouraging users to suit up for “Formal Friday” on Oct. 9th. For every dressed-up photo tagged with #FormalFriday on social media, Defy will donate $1 to Career Gear. Riggle's credits include \"21 Jump Street,\" \"The Hangover,\" and \"The Daily Show.\" He said, “While last year we encouraged men to get off the couch and man up in the home, this year we’re taking it to the office. No more passing out in the break room after crushing two Chipotle burritos at lunch!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:32:29.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
