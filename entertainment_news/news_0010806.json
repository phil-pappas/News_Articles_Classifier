Graffiti saying Homeland is ‘racist’ (Heba Amin, Caram Kapp and Stone) \nThey wrote phrases such as “Homeland is racist”, “Homeland is a joke and it didn’t make us laugh” and “This show does not represent the views of the artists”. \nIn a post on Heba’s website, she explained their actions, writing: “We considered what a moment of intervention could relay about our own and many others’ political discontent with the series. It was our moment to make our point by subverting the message using the show itself.” Homeland stars Nazanin Boniadi, Alex Gansa, Claire Danes, Mandy Patinkin and Rupert Friend (Paul Bruinooge/AP) \nTheir work will be seen in the second episode of the fifth season, which aired in the US earlier this week and will be shown in the UK on October 18, as lead character Carrie Mathison – played by Danes – walks past a wall daubed with Arabic script. Promoted stories \nHeba said they were given a set of images of “pro-Assad graffiti- apparently natural in a Syrian refugee camp” in an initial meeting, but said the Arabic script they decided on was not checked over by the show’s producers. \n“The content of what was written on the walls, however, was of no concern. In their eyes, Arabic script is merely a supplementary visual that completes the horror-fantasy of the Middle East, a poster image dehumanizing an entire region to human-less figures in black burkas and moreover, this season, to refugees,” she continued. \n“The show has thus created a chain of causality with Arabs at its beginning and as its outcome – their own victims and executioners at the same time.” \nHomeland’s depiction of the Muslim world has come under fire, with Islamabad depicted as a “hellhole” in the fourth series. Homeland creator and writer Alex Gansa (Eric Charbonneau/Invision) \nThe show’s creator and executive producer Alex Gansa told Deadline: “We wish we’d caught these images before they made it to air. \n“However, as Homeland always strives to be subversive in its own right and a stimulus for conversation, we can’t help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.” Share article \nHomeland, developed by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa, is based on the Israeli series Hatufim. It made its debut on screens in 2011. Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:35:25.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
