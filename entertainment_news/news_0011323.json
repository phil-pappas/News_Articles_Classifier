The release of their debut album Communion, and its subsequent topping of the UK charts, proved to be a watershed moment this year for British music and global pop at large. Promoted stories \nIt’s now sold over 650,000 copies worldwide and has taken up permanent residence in the UK top 20 – making it the fastest selling debut in 2015 from a UK signed band. \nThe three-piece, led by frontman Olly Alexander, have made their name this year as one of the hottest tickets going. This years’ Glastonbury festival saw them play one of the most packed out shows the John Peel stage has ever seen and, on the other side of the pond, they have recently completed a sold out tour playing their biggest North American venues to date. \nTheir forthcoming single ‘Eyes Shut’ is released on November 13. \nThe band’s luminous brand of electro-pop, over-layered with sweetly smooth vocals and bright and heady beats has been called “music you can dance and cry to”. \nThe band comprises of bassist Mikey Goldsworthy, keyboard player Emre Turkmen, and vocalist Olly Alexander who have spent the last few years charming audiences worldwide in their merging of R&B, deep house, and classic-pop. \nTalking to the Daily Echo Emre said he was overwhelmed by their success – and the No one hit ‘King’!. \n“We are thrilled about it but also a little bit freaked out by it! We certainly weren’t expecting it - putting it mildly! Our manager didn’t tell us how well it was doing until the day it went to number one and we were shocked!. We were up in Glasgow, just about to go on stage and Olly was a bit ill. Then we heard we were going to number one. We all got freaked out by it and Olly actually cried! \n\"We try not to think too much about it – you would go mad if you did. We just do music and then it’s out of your hands into the world – a bit like having a child. We just do our best and don’t put ourselves under too much undue pressure. We never planned any of this. \n“Since winning the BBC award it’s gone mad. My mum lives in Turkey and she heard about it on the BBC World channel and she called me up and woke me up to tell me. It was on their culture section and I thought oh God it’s a big deal; people across the globe know of us now. \n\"We were in LA when she called us - we were shooting our video for King, it was surreal. It only sunk in on the day of the awards. I’m one of those people unless I have it in front of me I can’t believe it. It is manic.” \nEven though Emre has been making music since he was a child he didn’t plan this career – he actually trained as an architect. \n“I spent five years at college – seven years in total to become an architect and gave it all up a couple of months later. It is entirely different! I try to compare them [the two jobs] but they are chalk and cheese. \n\"Mickey was working in a restaurant, Olly was acting but then it got serious and it was fun, so here we are!I’ve been making music since I was a kid but in a room with guitars and gadgets and Olly says he always wanted to be a singer , whilst Mickey’s dad use to be a music teacher and is still in a band, so maybe it was meant to be.” Share article \n*Tickets go on sale on Friday, October 16 at 9am. \nBH Live Tickets: 0844 576 3000 Promoted Stories PREVIEW: Years and Years, Bournemouth BIC  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:11:46.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
