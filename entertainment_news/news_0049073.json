Night Shyamalan project , which is being produced by Jason Blum. According to Deadline , McAvoy will replace Joaquin Phoenix , who was previously eyed for the role. Shyamalan and Blum previously worked together in \" The Visit \", which brought in $53 million at worldwide box office against a budget of $5 million. The upcoming untitled project is said to have the same range of budget with \"The Visit\". It will start filming in November in the director's hometown in Philadelphia. Blum will produce alongside Marc Bienstock with Ashwin Rajan and Steven Schneider tapped as executive producers. Just like most of Shyamalan projects, the plot details of the upcoming project are still kept under wraps. Sources say that it will likely include elements of the supernatural and will be a thriller movie. McAvoy will next be seen in \" Victor Frankenstein \", which will arrive in the U.S. on November 25. He plays the titular scientist in the horror film alongside Daniel Radcliffe . McAvoy recently finished filming \" X-Men: Apocalypse \", in which he reprises his role as Professor X. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Untitled M.
