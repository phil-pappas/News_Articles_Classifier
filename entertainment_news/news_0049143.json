The crowd of 80,076 was the second-largest in Rich Stadium history, and the Sunday night game was telecast on TNT. Yes, TNT actually had an NFL contract back then! FS Mark Kelso suffered a broken left ankle late in the game and would miss the majority of the rest of the regular season. Cornelius Bennett had two sacks for 19 yards in losses and Darryl Talley had 10 tackles to lead the defense. The Raiders drove 69 yards to Jay Schroeder's TD pass to Willie Gault in the first quarter, but Buffalo tied it in the second when Chris Hale recovered Tim Brown's fumble on a punt return at the Raiders 15 which was forced by Steve Tasker. Three plays later, Jim Kelly hit Andre Reed for a TD. In the third, LA drove 47 yards in 11 plays to Marcus Allen's TD, but the Bills answered as Kelly hit Keith McKeller for a TD. During the 78-yard drive, he also hit James Lofton for 23 yards. LA got that back, moving 69 yards to Steve Smith's TD reception for a 24-14 lead before the roof collapsed. Five plays after the kickoff, Kelly hit Lofton for 42-yard TD to make it 24-21, and after a three-and-out by the Raiders, Tasker blocked a punt which J.D. Williams picked up and returned 38 yards for the go-ahead score. Three plays after the kickoff, Bennett sacked Schroeder, forced a fumble and recovered it, which set up a Scott Norwood field goal. Then Nate Odomes stole ball from Gault after he'd made a catch and ran for 49 yards for the clinching TD.

The Raiders have a hard-nosed defense and an explosive offense. But mystique does not mean you win every game.\"\nSteve Tasker on his blocked punt: \"You always feel like you can block a kick. J.D. got in there real quick and (Jeff) Gossett saw him and turned and kicked the ball right into me.\"\nMarv Levy : \"Billy Conn beat the crap out of Joe Louis for 12 rounds and then Louis knocked him out in the 13th. Those plays (blocked kicks) aren't luck. Steve and James spend a lot of time looking at film. We work hard on blocking kicks. If you quit, you'll never get one. This was a very big win, but losing Mark (Kelso) took some of the joy out of it.\"\nKent Hull: \"We were struggling a long time and the crowd stayed with us. Sometimes when you get behind they start booing, but there was none of that.\"\nRaiders defensive end Greg Townsend: \"They're a good team, but there was a little luck involved. They didn't play football with us on the line, they beat us on fluke plays.\"\nTHE NUMBERS\nRaiders 7 3 7 7 - 24\nBills 0 7 7 24 - 38\nLAR - Willie Gault 11 pass from Jay Schroeder (Jeff Jaeger kick), 11:25\nBUF - Andre Reed 13 pass from Jim Kelly (Scott Norwood kick), 10:51\nLAR - FG Jaeger 19, 15:00\nLAR - Marcus Allen 9 run (Jaeger kick), 9:16\nBUF - Keith McKeller 15 pass from Kelly (Norwood kick), 13:03\nLAR - Steve Smith 4 pass from Schroeder (Jaeger kick), 4:25\nBUF - James Lofton 42 pass from Kelly (Norwood kick), 6:23\nBUF - J.D.

He felt he clearly deserved to join several of his teammates who were picked, and the normally talkative Odomes was noticeably silent.\nWhen it happened again in 1991, Odomes shrugged his shoulders and just figured it was never going to happen for him. \"All I care about is that the Buffalo Bills win games,\" he said. But then in 1992 and 1993, as the Bills continued winning AFC championships, the voters took stock of Odomes' body of work and ended his frustration by sending him to Hawaii.\nOdomes came to the Bills as a second-round pick in 1987, the second DB selected that year behind only Pittsburgh's future Hall of Famer, Rod Woodson. He cracked the starting lineup from day one, and during a seven-year run with the Bills, Odomes started 107 of the 108 games he played for Buffalo, collecting 26 interceptions and eight fumble recoveries, returning three of the turnovers for touchdowns including the clinching 49-yard fumble return in this game against the Raiders.\n“All I care about is that the Buffalo Bills win games”\nNate Odomes Although he stood just 5-foot-9, he was quick and physical, and a player who fought gamely against the biggest receivers he routinely faced. The play against the Raiders was a perfect example as Willie Gault caught a pass along the sideline, but Odomes went in for the tackle and simply pulled the ball from Gault's arms and raced down the sideline for the touchdown that capped a 24-point fourth-quarter explosion.\nOdomes, of course, made one of the biggest plays in Bills history a few years later when his interception in overtime set up Steve Christie for the game-winning field goal against Houston in the wild-card playoff game forever known as The Comeback Game.\nOdomes left the Bills after their fourth straight Super Bowl defeat, a season in which he tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with nine, and signed a big free agent contract with Seattle, but a knee injury in an offseason charity basketball game prevented him from ever playing for the Seahawks in the two years he was there. He finished his NFL career playing seven games for Atlanta in 1996.\nPREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFirst Super Season Week 1: Bills rough up George, Colts\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFirst Super Season Week 2: Bills blown out in Miami\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFirst Super Season Week 3: Bills bounce back big\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nFirst Super Season Week 4: 20 points in 77 seconds", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e672844de88fe0e87b2d9b68c59effe338d6b46/r=300/http/d2ft4b0ve1aur1.cloudfront.net/images-434/apple-touch-icon-152x152-pfr-precomposed.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/06/Rochester/Rochester/635797463879866018-roc-56p99ebuv0p13c31k1md-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/632d5ff4942b076835558677c8e0c61f747caaf2/c=0-3-1280-965&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Rochester/Rochester/635797463879866018-roc-56p99ebuv0p13c31k1md-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e952a77a8812f93ea866309efefa1244d39a110d/c=309-0-2362-2053/local/-/media/2015/09/29/Rochester/Rochester/635791319628134045-AP-30575659477.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/175738c7b85963de84d570f47a12066566c12515/c=81-809-1945-2673/local/-/media/2015/09/03/Rochester/Rochester/635769166888328327-GettyImages-356209.jpg", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/1990.htm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/158046224f45ad80cb3904b6db189332c83f4673/c=512-40-2448-1976/local/-/media/2015/09/15/Rochester/Rochester/635779289188999165-2-GettyImages-351246.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6599ce50186071d9d1df17e81f0b1212168b2eb/r=500x378/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Rochester/Rochester/635797463879866018-roc-56p99ebuv0p13c31k1md-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cccb215cee229549c0dcef22c9d3b677ab9a3e26/c=0-120-827-947/local/-/media/2015/09/04/Rochester/B9318680796Z.1_20150904135329_000_G69BQSQMG.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35cd3b497fdda4d0a5f3e135fff5ec601b9f2044/c=539-0-2643-2104/local/-/media/2015/09/23/Rochester/Rochester/635785642934359976-AP-90092411038.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:06:37.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
