Star Wars In Concert Luke Skywalker and C-3PO in a scene from Star Wars IV A New Hope onscreen during Star Wars In Concert. Related Sponsored Links By Cox Media Group National Content Desk \nThe movie may be nearly 40 years old, but fanatics still argue the finer, and not so finer, points of Star Wars . \nOne of the biggest debates is whether Mark Hamill flubbed his line after he blows up the Death Star. \nSome believe he says Carrie, when Luke Skywalker greets Princess Leia as he gets out of the X-Wing fighter. \nThere are clips like this one on YouTube that some say you can hear him say \"Carrie.\" \nEven this week, only months before the new Star Wars : The Force Awakens film hits theaters, Screen Rant included the supposed flub as one of its top 10 movie outtakes that made it into final cuts. \nHamill responded to the claims that he made a mistake, going to his Twitter account to explain that he said \"There she\" not Carrie. TOTAL BS! Actually said \"There she...\" as in \"There she is.\" Dialogue in that scene was dubbed.
