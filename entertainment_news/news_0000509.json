The British Olympic diver and the Oscar-winning screenwriter have just announced their engagement the old-fashioned way in The Times newspaper. \"The engagement is announced between Tom, son of Robert and Debra Daley of Plymouth, and Lance, son of Jeff Bisch of Philadelphia and Anne Bisch of Lake Providence,\" it reads. They, however, remain silent on social media about the engagement. Tom Daley announces his engagement in The Times this morning. pic.twitter.com/2h10p6jX55 — Dan Wootton (@danwootton) October 1, 2015 The couple started dating in summer 2013. In June this year, Daley talked to BuzzFeed about settling down and starting a family, \"I would like to get married. Of course, I'd like to have children, too. I grew up with two brothers, so I'd like to have at least three.\" The couple was recently seen hitting the red carpet together at the 2015 Pride of Britain Awards held at The Grosvenor House Hotel in London. They were joined at the September 28 event by David Hasselhoff , Alesha Dixon , Simon Cowell , and the Osbournes. Daley, now 21, first competed in the Olympics when he was only 14 and won a bronze medal at the 2012 Games in London. Black, 41, won a WGA award and an Oscar for the script he wrote for the 2008 movie about gay activist and politician Harvey Milk . Tom Daley is not the only celebrity to announce their engagement in the newspaper. Last year, Benedict Cumberbatch introduced his fiancee, Sophie Hunter, in The London Times. The couple married on Valentine's Day this year and welcomed their son several months later. \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:24:36.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
