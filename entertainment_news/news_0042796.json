But for one little girl from Greensboro — the show is a dream come true. \n10-year-old Olivia Dunn has been through more hard times than most people go through their entire lives. Earlier this spring, she was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma Stage 4 bone cancer. Doctors misdiagnosed her with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis almost two years ago. \nSince then, she's been fighting for her life. She's lost her hair from chemotherapy — next up is radiation. She's been through more than most of us have in our life. Olivia is excited to forget the pain & have fun tn! @WFMY pic.twitter.com/J10nkpaqX5 — Ben Powell (@benpowelltv) October 21, 2015 \nShe hasn't been able to live a normal life because her bones are too brittle and she's constantly in pain. A few months ago, Olivia found out she would get to meet her idol, Taylor Swift. \nOlivia Dunn and her mother, Tara. (Photo: WFMY News 2) \nOn Wednesday night, just like her favorite Taylor Swift song, her \"Wildest Dream\" came true. Olivia got to meet the pop icon before the concert. \n\"It has been really tough and very hard and it's not easy,\" said Dunn. \"I probably won't be focusing on that tonight because I'm just going to be so happy.\" \nHer dream didn't end on Wednesday. \nThe Make-a-Wish Foundation is sending Olivia and her family to Disney World for a nine day trip later this week.
