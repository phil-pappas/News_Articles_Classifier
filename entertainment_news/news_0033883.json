Daniel Craig and Monica Bellucci (Joel Ryan/Invision) \n“It’s important to show that a woman at 50 can be just as interesting and ­attractive as a woman who is 30,” she told the Daily Mirror. \n“We should not be worried about age when it comes to love and attraction. Just as younger women are attracted to older men, it shouldn’t be considered strange that men in their 20s and 30s are drawn to older women. \n“It’s the chemistry and energy between men and women that counts… True sexiness is in the mind, the imagination, not in the age of the body.” Daniel Craig and Monica Bellucci in Spectre (Jonathan Olley/Metro-Goldwyn-May) \nMonica’s character is an assassin’s wife left widowed by Bond, a role reprised by Daniel Craig for the fourth time. \nSpectre also sees the 47-year-old actor reuniting with director Sam Mendes, following their collaboration of Skyfall. \nThe actress, who initially thought she was replacing Dame Judi Dench as M, said: “Sam explained that James Bond was going to have a story with a mature woman. \n“He said ‘the concept is revolutionary’. It’s a sign that cinema is able to take a new and more open look at mature women.” Share article \nSpectre, which also stars Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Christoph Waltz and Andrew Scott, opens in UK cinemas on October 26.
