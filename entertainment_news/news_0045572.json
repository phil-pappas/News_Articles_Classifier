Police Department confirming the Blackhawks right winger was being investigated for \"an incident that allegedly occurred\" at Kane's home just outside of Buffalo on the weekend of Aug. 2.\nKane has not been charged with any crime since he was accused of sexual assault. He said in late September he didn't know what was next as far as that was concerned. But as he waits for the legal process to play out, hockey will take up plenty of his time.\n\"I feel good when I get to the rink,\" Kane said Wednesday. \"It's kind of like my little getaway from everything â€” being with the guys, playing hockey, doing things I love. I'm here, I just try to focus on that.\"\nThe plan worked early Wednesday. Kane watched new teammate Artemi Panarin kiss the glass after taking his pass and stuffing the puck past Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist to tie the score 1-1 less than six minutes into the game.\nPanarin's first NHL score was perhaps his retort to Kane's words from a day earlier, when Kane joked about the language barrier that exists between most of the team and the Russian rookie.\nPhotos from the season opener at the United Center.\n\"Yeah, that's what we have to get him to understand: 'Pass to 88,'\" Kane said. \"I've said that a few times to him. He just kind of laughs, goes off and keeps shooting. Hopefully we'll get him to understand that.\"\nNothing has been lost in translation as far as Kane's game on the ice.\nThe 26-year-old said he understands all the questions about an investigation that has taken its share of strange turns. He has said he would like to answer them, and will when he can. For now, his mind is on the present, he said.\nKane wasn't sure what to expect when he was introduced at the United Center.\n\"I don't know what the reception is going to be,\" he said. \"But I've been fortunate to have the support (of fans and teammates).\"\nThe answer: Loud. Kane pumped his fist toward the sea of red seated around him while he skated onto the ice during pregame festivities.\nHe received a taste of that reception when he walked the red carpet on Madison Street during player introductions three hours before the puck dropped on the 2015-16 season.\nUnlike some of his mates, Kane did not address the crowd, but instead acknowledged it with a wave.\n\"Whether it's hockey or different things, we've done a good job of kind of quieting that outside noise and focusing on what we have to,\" Kane said.\nOn Wednesday, that was the noise inside the United Center.\npskrbina@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribSkrbina\nPrivacy Policy Patrick Kane Ice Hockey Crime New York Rangers United Center Chicago Blackhawks Henrik Lundqvist", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615d697/turbine/ct-blackhawks-vs-rangers-20151007-017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615d93a/turbine/ct-patrick-kane-blackhawks-opener-spt-1008-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615c65c/turbine/ct-blackhawks-vs-rangers-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615d693/turbine/ct-blackhawks-vs-rangers-20151007-018"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:56:57.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
