An Ohio boy has dismantled his “gun,” but his local school district is unwilling to budge from the zero-tolerance suspension it meted out last month.\nNathan Entingh, 10, spent three days out of Devonshire Alternative Elementary School in February for making a gun gesture with his hand, pointing it at another student and saying “bang,” an offense the Columbus School District equated to bringing a “look-alike firearm” on school grounds.\nBut his parents appealed the discipline, despite the fifth-grader having already served his suspension, in the hopes of having the “crime” wiped from little Nathan’s school record.\n“I think it’s a huge leap to call a finger a gun and I think it’s terrible to suspend a 10-year-old for three days for playing,” the boy’s grandfather, Bill Entingh, told the Daily News on Tuesday. “The principal made it look as bad as possible.”\nThe district’s spokesman, Jeff Warner, told the Columbus Dispatch that a hearing officer offered to revise the offense to be called a “volatile act” instead of the hand “gun” charge.\nBut Entingh told The News he rejected the proposed change and instead plans to appeal the suspension to the district superintendent. If that doesn’t work, Entingh’s willing to sue the school and Principal Patricia Price for what he called an “overzealous” reaction to his grandson’s in-school horseplay.\n“I don’t think this is right, I think it’s being grossly blown out of proportion,” Entingh said. “The way they’ve treated Nathan has left emotional damage. I believe that on his record, it’s not going to reflect that he pointed his finger, it will show he had a fake firearm at school. That’s a broad jump to fit the language of the offense, which refers to bringing any spring-loaded type gun to school.”\nAlmost immediately after Nathan returned from suspension last month, school officials contacted Bill Entingh with concerns about drawings they’d found in the boy’s notebook. Nathan had scribbled recreations of swords, some figures and tridents — things he’d seen while watching “Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief,” a children’s movie rated PG.\nHe’d also written “I’m an assassin” next to pictures of ninjas, his grandfather said. The boy was drawing figures he’d seen on his older brother’s Assassin’s Creed video game and had no nefarious intent.\nBut recent school shootings have administrators overly cautious, and Price, the principal, warned her students several times that they are not permitted to make any gun jokes or gestures, and has sent home letters to parents.\n“The kids were told, ‘If you don’t stop doing this type of stuff, there would be consequences,’” Warner told The Dispatch after the suspension was disclosed last month. “It’s just been escalating.”\nThe ongoing battle has soured Bill Entingh on the Columbus school system, which many of his five children and 26 grandchildren have attended.\n“I can guarantee that none of my grandchildren will go to that school next year,” a frustrated Entingh said.\nsgoldstein@nydailynews.com or follow on Twitter\nRelated Stories 10-year-old suspended for making gun with finger", "external_links": ["http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/03/18/finger-gun-suspension-is-going-to-stand.html", "http://twitter.com/NYCitySasha"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:58:01.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
