Never-before-seen clips of the late actor recording the voice of the beloved Genie will be included in the Diamond Edition Blu-ray pack of the 1992 animated film. The team behind \"Aladdin\" visited \" Good Morning America \" on Friday, October 9 to talk about the digital re-release as well as Williams' contribution to the film. Co-sreenwriter John Musker said, \"We wrote the part with Robin in mind, but we didn't know if he would do it. Fortunately for us, he did, [but] we were totally walking down the plank. If he said no, we were in big trouble because the whole concept was built around Robin.\" Co-writer Ron Clements added, \"There was no one else that could be the Genie and fortunately he agreed to do it. And he worked so hard. We recorded him in four hour sessions, and he would be going four hours straight... by the end he was just drenched. He had so much energy and so much passion.\" Animator Eric Goldberg also said of Williams, \"Aside from being funny as anything, he was such a warm person. He was the Genie - it was bigger than life.\" The \"Aladdin\" Diamond Edition Blu-ray pack will hit the stores on October 13. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Robin Williams News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:08:40.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
