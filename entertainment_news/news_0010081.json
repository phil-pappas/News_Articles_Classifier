Photo: Janie Barrett \nCasula Powerhouse Arts Centre is turning 21 â€“ but director Kiersten Fishburn is adamant it's not about to turn into a boring \"grown-up\".\nCPAC is throwing itself a 21st birthday party and part of the celebration involves the return of the infamous colourpult, a trebuchet-like \"art weapon\" that hurls flour-and-dye colour bombs, first seen at the Way Out West children's festival.\n\"We had it for the kids but many of the adults were disappointed that they didn't get to use it,\" says Fishburn. \"It's making a second visit for the grown-ups to have a play this time.\nSplat! ... CPAC after being 'bombed' by the giant colourpult. Photo: Ben Williams \n\"There are not many gallery directors who get to sign off on throwing bombs at their building!\"\nAdvertisement Fishburn has headed CPAC for four &frac12; years and during that time has seen enormous change and growth in the region.\n\"The Liverpool I started working in four years ago is totally different from the one I'm working in now,\" she says.\nIn particular, she believes the centre has won over local hearts and minds.\n\"I think it is now fairly well embedded in the community. It's absolutely critical for regional centres to be relevant to the community in which they are located. The idea of just shoe-horning in any types of exhibition or theatre is anathema to us. We program from looking around and speaking to and engaging with our community members.\"\nOne of the keys to remaining relevant, she says, is to promote work that is \"culturally grounded\" in the diverse ethnic communities of the region.\nShe points to exhibitions such as 2012's No Added Sugar , which featured Muslim women contemporary artists, and I Love Pho , from 2008, which explored the role of food in building connections between the Vietnamese community and other groups.\n\"The work that has been culturally grounded and particular to the communities that we are living in have been the most significant contributions the arts centre has made,\" she says.\nThere has also been a major shift repositioning western Sydney from being forever on the edge of the city to firmly establishing its own identity and legitimacy.\n\"When Casula opened, at least from the perspective of the city centre they were somewhat on the fringe,\" says Fishburn.\n\"I don't feel we are on the fringe at all any more. I think we are part of a really vibrant and interesting centre which happens to be western Sydney based.\n\"The next 21 years are about looking at that culture of artistic practices that comes out of western Sydney, that wants to stay here and speak to western Sydney and doesn't feel the need to go to the city centre to legitimise itself. It's just as legitimate being at Casula Powerhouse or at Penrith or at Blacktown or at Campbelltown.\"\nFittingly, the central part of Casula's 21st party will be an exhibition bringing together 21 artists, all of whom have had a close association with the centre.\nIt features names such as Gordon Bennett, Fiona Foley, Richard Larter and Angelica Mesiti. While it's not a conclusive retrospective of the past 21 years the show gives a \"flavour\" of the artists who have exhibited at CPAC and explores many of the key themes of diversity, identity, culture and personal expression.\nThere'll also be a free '90s dance party, a variety show and, of course, that epic colour-hurling contraption.\n\"It's quite extraordinary but I have to admit I'm somewhat anxious about it,\" says Fishburn. \"But from the start of being at Casula, one of the things I have always said is fantastic about this centre is that we have some freedom to fail. If you can't have a giant catapult in your back garden and throw colour bombs what are you going to do? If you have that freedom you've got to exploit it!\"\nThe celebrations run from October 17 to November 29. http://www.casulapowerhouse.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:20:11.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
