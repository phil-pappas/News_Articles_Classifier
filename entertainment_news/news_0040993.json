Another major topic of discussion would be the roadmap for the conduct of the next edition of IPL after two teams — Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals — were suspended for two years by the Supreme Court on the Justice Lodha Committee’s recommendations in the wake of the 2013 spot-fixing and betting scandal. \nThe meeting would also fix the date of its AGM, which could not be convened before September end as per its own Memorandum of Rules and Regulations, after the annual reports of its secretary Anurag Thakur, treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary and all its sub-committees are tabled and passed by the all-powerful group. \nThe incident of bottle throwing by a section of the irate crowd at Cuttack during the second India-South Africa T20 International is also expected to come up for discussion. Manohar has already asked for a full report of the incident from the Odisha Cricket Association. Also on the agenda would be finding a new sponsor for the IPL after PepsiCo expressed its desire to end the association. \n  11:44 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:46:32.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
