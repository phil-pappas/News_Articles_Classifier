They are still running test to find out the stage and how far it has spread... GoFundMe link in Bio... if you want to donate... all I ask is for you to pray for him...Value the life you have and live it...\" \nAyden was diagnosed on Tuesday after spending over two weeks in an intensive care unit with what doctors believed was pneumonia. To make matters really tough for the family, the sick tot's mother, Lindsey, was fired from her job because she chose to be at hospital, by her son's side, rather than at work. \nThe goal for the campaign was initially $20,000, but on Wednesday, Swift handed over $50,000 after learning all about her dancer's nephew. \n\"Baby Ayden, I'm lucky enough to perform with your uncle Toshi on tour,\" Swift wrote on the site. \"All of us are praying for you and your mama and sending so much love your way. Love, Taylor.\" \nStunned by the pop star's kind gesture, Davidson returned to Instagram and wrote , \"So I get off the plane in Toronto and this (her GoFundMe message) is the 1st thing I see... taylorswift is an angel and My family and I can't thank her enough... She is such an incredible human being... This will help Lil Toshi in this time of need... Let's pray for him to beat this... This unexpected gift is truly a blessing.\" \nSwift has also been personally affected by the disease - earlier this year, she revealed her mum Andrea had been diagnosed with cancer.
