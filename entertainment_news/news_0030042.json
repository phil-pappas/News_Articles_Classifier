In an interview with Business Insider to promote his new movie \" Burnt \", the German actor gave an update about his character, saying that Zemo would appear without his iconic purple mask. \"He does not wear the mask,\" the 37-year-old actor said, referring to the purple cloak the character famously wears. \"You would be surprised, it's different than what you'd think.\" Bruhl went on explaining that his character might be different from what people expected. \"It's loosely connected to this character. But that's what I like about the Marvel guys, some of the characters and things they're dealing with always reference to current events so my character is from a different area than you would think,\" Bruhl said. In the comic books, during his time in the Nazi party, Zemo created \"Adhesive X\", a super-powerful adhesive that eventually spilled on Zemo in a battle with Captain America. It made the purple mask stuck on his face forever. The film will take place in the aftermath of \" Avengers: Age of Ultron \". It will feature Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jr. ) and the Cap ( Chris Evans ) fighting against each other with War Machine ( Don Cheadle ), Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson ), Black Panther ( Chadwick Boseman ) and The Vision on Tony Stark's side while Winter Soldier ( Sebastian Stan ), Falcon ( Anthony Mackie ), Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner ), Ant-Man ( Paul Rudd ) and Sharon Carter ( Emily VanCamp ) will team up with the Cap. Anthony Russo and Joe Russo direct the movie with Kevin Feige producing. The hero-against-hero movie is slated for a U.S. release on May 6, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Captain America: Civil War News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:23.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
