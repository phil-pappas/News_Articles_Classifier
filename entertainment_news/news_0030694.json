Yahoo landed Honda as a launch sponsor for \"Community,\" which is produced by Sony Pictures Television. But apparently it couldn't gather enough of an audience, or long-term commitments from advertisers, to make the investment into original content at that scale pay back. \nYahoo previously teased that it may be renewing \"Community\" for a seventh season, or even take part in a movie deal. That may appear less likely with Tuesday's disclosure, but insiders tell Variety that a \"Community\" movie is still in play -- with or without Yahoo. \nYahoo has been hit by several recent high-level executive departures, including the exit of chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt, who in September joined independent studio STX Entertainment as president of its digital unit. \nThe revelation came as Yahoo turned in another quarter of financial results that failed to meet Wall Street expectations, leading CEO Marissa Mayer to promise that the company will focus on fewer products in 2016 to try to right the ship. \nYahoo posted third quarter 2015 revenue of $1.23 billion and earnings per share of 15 cents; analysts had expected $1.26 billion in sales and EPS of 17 cents. \n\"As we move into 2016, we will work to narrow our strategy, focusing on fewer products with higher quality to achieve improved growth and profitability,\" Mayer said in announcing the results. \nYahoo also announced a new pact with Google for search results and ads. That agreement will \"complement\" the search services provided by Microsoft and Yahoo's own search technologies and ad products, according to the company. \nIn addition trying to improve the metrics of its core businesses, Mayer called out as a top priority Yahoo's planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings, representing 384 million shares its owns in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. That transaction is still pending regulatory approval. Yahoo has expected that to close in Q4 but Mayer said on the earnings call that the spinoff may not be completed until January. \nMayer noted that Yahoo's total Q3 revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while the strategic \"Mavens\" businesses -- comprising mobile, video, native ads and Tumblr ads -- rose 43% from a year earlier, to $422 million. But audience acquisition costs in the latest period soared to $223 million (up from $54 million), and Yahoo remains heavily reliant on desktop PC users. \nYahoo cut guidance for the fourth quarter: It expects revenue to be between $1.16 billion and $1.2 billion, down from $1.3 billion previously. \nYahoo's stock fell as much as 2.8% in after-hours trading Tuesday, after closing regular trading down 2% to $32.83 per share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:51:05.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
