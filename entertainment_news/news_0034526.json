As well as that, that quartet of peerless glam-tinged rock – Slade Alive!, Slayed?, Old New Borrowed And Blue, and Slade In Flame – have been remastered and reissued on heavyweight vinyl. \nIt’s a collector’s dream, and will hopefully earn Slade the kind of critical reappraisal they’re so overdue. Bands as diverse as Motley Crue, Kiss, Ramones and Sex Pistols cited them as an influence. Oasis even covered Cum On Feel The Noize as a B-side. \n“I think we’re far more respected now than we were at the time,” says Holder, 69. “We were incredibly commercially successful, but a lot of people regarded us as a bit of joke.” \nLook at any photograph of the band from their heyday and you have to admit, he has a point. There are tartan jumpsuits, 10-inch platform shoes, tailcoats, space-age silver one-pieces, and that’s before you get to Dave Hill’s ridiculous fringe or Holder’s mutton chops and mirrored top hat. \n“We were always on TV as well,” says Holder. “A lot of people probably thought that overshadowed the content of the music. We don’t have any complaints, though. Like I said, we were phenomenally successful so we didn’t notice any criticism.” \nIt’s hard not to think a band with as many hits as Slade should be held in slightly higher regard than they are. They had six Number One singles in the UK, the same as Queen, Blondie and Rod Stewart, and more than The Police, David Bowie and Bee Gees. \nSlade also made the Top 20 with 17 consecutive singles. There were chart toppers in Japan and Australia too, and they enjoyed a handful of hits in the States, years after they’d all but faded into obscurity in the UK. \nHolder hasn’t heard the four albums being reissued for some time. Glam: Slade \n“I don’t think they’ve dated, they still sound relevant and fresh,” he says. “These records are 45 years old. \n“Where did those 45 years go?” says Holder. “I am proud of it, proud of all of it. We were together for 25 years, the four original members; me, Jim, Don [Powell] and Dave, and we were recording for pretty much all of that. We had our first hit single in ‘71 and we had our last in ‘91, so that was good. We put together a vast catalogue.” \nHolder left the band in 1992, as did Jim Lea. Powell and Hill have continued to perform and record music under the name. What do you think? Be the first to comment \nHolder says the band will never reform. “That’s not going to happen. Too much time has gone by. I had 30 years on the road, that was enough,” he says. \nOver the past 20-odd years he’s acted, had his own radio show, hosted a TV quiz show and toured his one-man show. As the Slade’s 50th anniversary approaches, Holder’s happy to listen to their music for the first time in years and let the memories come flooding back. He says: “I’ve been reminiscing, and there’ll likely be more reissues to come. That’s more than enough for me.” Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
