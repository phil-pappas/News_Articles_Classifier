Advertisement If you go Walla Walla band Wildwood Park will debut its first CD, “A Beauty in Her Day,” in a performance Oct. 30, beginning at 7:30 p.m. at Gesa Power House Theatre, 111 N. Sixth Ave. The show will feature San Francisco virtuoso pedal steel guitarist Bruce Kaphan and other musical guests. Tickets are $20 and available online at phtww.com and at the theater’s box office, open 1-5 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays. The CD is available to buy in Walla Walla at Hot Poop music store, Book & Game Co., and Tra Vigne antique and furniture store. It is also available online at ubne.ws/1NUNFs8, wildwoodparkband.com , and will soon be available at Amazon.com and iTunes. In a house on Hobson Street, just a block from their namesake, members of Wildwood Park prepare for an afternoon rehearsal. As for any band, there are the mic checks, the twang of guitar-string plucks, the ring of cymbals as a drum set is situated. As well, a little boy, Tom, darts in and out to model his homemade robot costume and calls from his sister, the singer and violinist, explaining she’ll be a little late. Wildwood Park is, after all, a family affair — whether by blood or a love affair with music. Aaron Burgess and his younger brother Jesse have collaborated on music since 1968 as boys — Jesse was then 9. Later, from 1976 to 1991, they formed a band called Solomon Jest, writing more than 250 songs and playing them all over Walla Walla, particularly at Whitman College. The family music genes run strong. Exhibit A is Anna Okada Burgess, Jesse’s 19-year-old daughter. A classically trained violinist, singer, and Celtic fiddler, she released a solo CD, “Spring in Brassica,” at age 14. At 15 she performed in the exclusive National High School Honors Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in New York. Recently the Burgesses and drummer Dov Friedman formed folk indie-rock band Wildwood Park and collaborated with a few celebrity musicians on their debut CD, “A Beauty in Her Day.” It will be introduced Oct. 30 in a concert at Gesa Power House Theatre. Okada Burgess wrote and plays the violin parts as well as sings, and it is those contributions that lend the album its distinctive sound. While conceived in Walla Walla, the new work has more parents than just the two Burgess brothers. Through portals made possible by the magic of electronics, plus an airline ticket, the CD also incorporates pedal steel guitar virtuoso Bruce Kaphan — whose credits include recording with R.E.M., Jewel and The Black Crowes, among others. He worked with Wildwood Park through phone calls, about 600 emails and a personal visit by Jesse Burgess to Kaphan’s San Francisco recording studio. Kaphan, a musician since the 1970s with thousands of performances on a resume thick with projects, “was very impressed with our music,” Jesse recalled. “But he thought we should have a higher level of performance.” That meant rerecording a number of piano, percussion and guitar parts, “basically taking the house over with recording work for a week,” he said. As well, internationally-acclaimed ukulele player Jake Shimabukuro — who’s played with Yo-Yo Ma, Jimmy Buffett and Bette Midler, to name a few top artists — makes a virtual contribution to the CD in “Petals Floating,” a song about the drowning of a friend in the 2011 Japan tsunami. Shimabukuro, based in Hawaii, worked with the band by online video chat studio to studio. Despite his fame, the ukulele artist was accessible and humble, trying this and that to make sure the Walla Walla band was satisfied with the collaboration, Jesse said. Friedman smiled at the memory at a recent rehearsal. “Playing music exposes yourself,” the drummer said. “Jake was so open and it just struck me that the interest on all our parts was making the music as good as possible. We were all in the same moment.” “A Beauty in Her Day” represents a relatively narrow slice of the music the band plays, Jesse noted, even while acknowledging the production goes beyond the initial “folksy rock” boundary with influences by Neil Young to The Beatles. There are hints of jazz and impressionism — that is to say, Western classical music colored by mood and ambience. And the CD is thoroughly colored by Okada Burgess, her youthful, airy voice and violin quickly searing a path through mellow instrumentals. Seconds into rehearsal, her eyes focus on an unseen horizon as she climbs into “I Dreamed I was a Big House,” the first of 13 tracks on the CD. “I dreamed I was a big house ... hiding in the wheat. And I would hear the wind blow ... and I would watch the garden grow ...” Bringing to her chin her latest violin — made in 1920 by Italian Luigi Digiuni — Anna’s playing then becomes the softly-sweet moan of wind that wraps around the house that stands on a tree-lined street. The Burgess brothers describe her sound as “intimate,” free of influence of other indie folk musicians. On this day, her voice is nearly haunting, filling the studio with a nearly tactile presence. Seated across the room, Friedman soaks it in, mixing Okada Burgess’ soaring vocals into the deep conversation his hands are having with the drums in front of him, while bass guitarist Nick Bader closes his eyes in the moment. Bader did not play on “A Beauty in her Day,” but is rehearsing with Wildwood Park for the CD debut party. Jesse Burgess did most of the bass work for the CD but at the Power House performance will play guitar and keyboards. “He can’t clone himself,” Bader explained. Behind Okada Burgess, her father and uncle play together but alone, seeming to feel the rain beating on the window, hearing the knock upon the door. “But then you came back no more,” Okada Burgess sings. Then there’s “Would You Like to Dance?” The track is rich, a juicy cornucopia of tambourine, shaker, organ and acoustic guitar, seasoned just so with drums and sauced with Okada Burgess’ lilting voice, optimistic among lyrics of a lost love. The CD is a mix of sad and hopeful songs, with delicate melodies reminiscent of John Lennon’s lyrical works. Subject matter ranges from love lost to a homeless man’s final hours on cold and abandoned streets. Yet, in their Walla Walla studio filled with an afternoon’s autumn light and a hammock woven from the musical notes made among friends, a listener can only be lifted up, to float on layers of sound of “A Beauty in Her Day.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:30:07.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
