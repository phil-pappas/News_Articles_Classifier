She and her 39 years old boxer fiance Wladimir Klitschko welcomed their baby daughter Kaya in December, 2014. \nLast month, the actress appeared on 'Live! With Kelly and Michael'. She opened up about her struggle against PPD and how she's been fighting against the disorder. \n\"It's something a lot of women experience. When you are told about postpartum depression you think it's 'I feel negative feelings towards my child; I want to injure or hurt my child.' I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do,\" said Panettier. \nShe further said, \"But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal.\" \nShe posted the below picture on twitter and tweeted: \nImage Courtesy: Twitter \nShe sounds happy about getting back in shape and very comfortable in her skin. She's successfully managed to shed all the extra pounds she had gained during her pregnancy. \nThe actress also spoke about the stigma associated with the disorder in the society by saying, \"There's a lot of misunderstanding. There's a lot of people out there that think that it's not real, that it's not true, that it's something that's made up in their minds, that 'Oh, it's hormones.' They brush it off.\" \n\"It's something that's completely uncontrollable. It's really painful and it's really scary and women need a lot of support\" she said while sounding emotionally low. \nAs the news about Hayden seeking help to battle PPD started to rotate in the media, one of her representatives said, Hayden Panettiere is voluntarily seeking professional help at a treatment center as she is currently battling postpartum depression. She asks that the media respect her privacy during this time.\" \nWe wish the Nashville star good luck on the journey towards betterment and a quick recovery of her fiance Klitschko, who is suffering from a calf injury caused during one of his boxing matches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:40:56.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
