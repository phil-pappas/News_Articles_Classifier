A sweeping, suspenseful novel, The Antioch Testament will be available in trade paper (ISBN: 978-1-63413-630-3, 376 pages, $17.95 ) and eBook editions on October 27, 2015 .\nAbout The Antioch Testament: When the novel opens, it's 2004 during the insurgency in Iraq . An American army patrol manages to rescue a frightened group of Iraqi Christians fleeing Islamic militants. The refugees' severely wounded leader, a priest, carries with him a mysterious bundle the group has brought with them from a northern Iraqi Christian monastery. As he clings to life, the priest insists on handing over the carefully-guarded package to the American army chaplain.\nWhen the bundle is unwrapped, Army chaplain Charles Monroe finds a large, scuffed, leather-bound ancient manuscript written in an unknown language. Fearing for the manuscript's safety in war-torn Iraq , the chaplain arranges to have the manuscript sent to Augusta, Georgia , his hometown. Eventually, the manuscript winds up in an Eastern Orthodox monastery where internationally- recognized linguists begin the arduous task of interpreting it.\nWhat the linguists discover is absolutely astonishing: the manuscript is a first century AD testimonial in Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke, describing what happened to Jesus' apostles after his Resurrection.\nBut time is running out. Unbeknownst to the interpreters, a fanatical Iraqi insurgent organization is bound and determined to retrieve or destroy the ancient manuscript before its secrets can be revealed. Some secrets may be worth dying for--but these secrets might even be worth killing for.\nAn extraordinary novel, The Antioch Testament is an imaginative, inventive tale that explores the lives of the apostles after the resurrection. Thoughtful and thought-provoking, intriguing and engaging, The Antioch Testament brims with intensity. Although the novel is a work of fiction, The Antioch Testament is resplendent with rich historical detail and based on early church tradition. In this, his debut novel, Donald Joiner delivers a carefully-crafted page-turner with a pulse-pounding plot, and engrossing storyline.\nGeorgia native Donald Joiner is a veteran who served during the Korean War era. A retired school superintendent and a lifelong student of history, Joiner has been married for fifty-two years and is a proud father and grandfather. He has taught Sunday school in his church for forty years. Joiner has also authored two previous books about antebellum churches in Georgia .\nFounded in 2007, Seraphina Press publishes an eclectic mix of fiction and non-fiction.
