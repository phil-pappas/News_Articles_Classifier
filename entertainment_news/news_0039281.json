'Jaw-dropping' \nAccording to the Daily Mirror , Spectre is \"an adventure right up there with the superspy's best\" featuring \"moments of jaw-dropping stuntwork\". \nThe Sun's reviewer concurred, saying the film contains \"all the classic elements fans expect\", including a \"jaw-dropping opening sequence\". \nVariety also singled out this \"expensively ludicrous opening sequence, set in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead,\" saying it \"ranks among the great 007 intros\". \nOther industry papers were less effusive, though, with the Hollywood Reporter saying it \"ultimately feels like a lesser film than Skyfall, falling back on cliche and convention.\" \nScreen International , meanwhile, said the film \"falls back on the formula to deliver a slightly flat, old-fashioned 007 by the numbers\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:11:02.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
