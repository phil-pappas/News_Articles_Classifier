Zimmern and crew hit up the city in May, visiting (and eating their way through) spots like Fox Chase's Rieker's butcher shop; Zitner's candies, where he gobbled down Butter Krak eggs; Federal Donuts for some za'tar-seasoned chicken; Southwest Philly's Le Mandingue for sub-Saharan Africa cuisine; Paesano's in the Italian Market for a sammie; and Center City stalwarts Abe Fisher and Zahav for the best from chefs Michael Solomonov and Yehuda Sichel . Catch Zimmern's Philly travels at 8 p.m. Tuesday. \n\nBut that ain't all for our area: Mo Rocca heads to South Jersey for an episode of My Grandmother's Ravioli , where he highlights the best food from those chefs better known as Grandpa and Grandma . \nThis is the fourth time Rocca has shot in and around Philly. The episode, airing at 8 p.m. Oct. 28 on the Cooking Channel, focuses on the Vincent Pesiri of Clementon, N.J. Vin and Mo whip up some spicy crabs, a paella, and bananas Foster. \nIn an interview, Rocca said he liked to shoot in Philadelphia because of our pride in ourselves (finally, someone notices). \"The country is becoming more and more homogenized, and people appreciate difference and accent. Philly has that,\" Rocca said. \"Distinctiveness is rarer and rarer now. There are places in the country where that resource is richer.\" \nSpoiler alert: Rocca told Sideshow that he and Vin get so into their cooking duties that, at one point, they need to strip down to undershirts. \nCompiled by Inquirer staff, with additional reporting by Michael Klein of Philly.com.
