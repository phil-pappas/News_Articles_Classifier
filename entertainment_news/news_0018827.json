(AP) - The wife of actor Randy Quaid has been jailed in Vermont on $500,000 bail for skipping out of the country after the couple was charged with vandalism.\nThe Quaids were detained at the Canadian border Friday night while trying to re-enter the United States after Canadian officials said they'd be deported.\nEvi Quaid entered a not guilty plea at her arraignment Monday morning on a charge of being a fugitive from justice; Randy Quaid was expected to be arraigned later Monday on the same charge.\nThey're wanted in Santa Barbara, California, to face felony charges filed in 2010 after they were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned.\nThe pair skipped several court appearances and went to Canada.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
