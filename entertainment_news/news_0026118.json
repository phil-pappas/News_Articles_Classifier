Posted today at 1:30pm \nABC/Randy Holmes (LOS ANGELES) -- Could Lindsay Lohan possibly have her sights on the presidency? \nThe Mean Girls star hinted at a run for the Oval Office in 2020, when she posted an Instagram photo on Friday that was captioned, \"In #2020 I may run for president. Through ups and downs #YESWECAN lets do this @kanyewest #truespirits thank your for inspiring us to be better people.\" \nLohan seemed to be taking a cue from Kanye West, who announced at the MTV Video Music Awards in August that he was running for president in 2020. \nLohan shared another Instagram photo on Saturday, this time of her and Kanye, accompanied by the message, \"The first thing I would like to do as president of US is take care of all of the children suffering in the world. #queenELIZABETH showed me how by having me in her country.\" \nLohan starred in a U.K. production of the David Mamet play Speed-the-Plow a year ago. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
