The first trailer for the new original series has now been released, seeing the comedic duo bringing laughs with their smart and witty humor. They combine taped segments and live in-studio sketches that promise \"plenty of sexy stuff.\" Keegan-Michael Key of \"Key & Peele\" is also featured in one of the sketches that is previewed in the video, playing a police officer. The four-episode half-hour series will premiere November 13 on Netflix. Odenkirk and Cross previously teamed up for \"Mr. Show\" which ran for three years on HBO from 1995-1998. Though it was never a huge hit in terms of ratings, the show was lauded by critics. A number of comedians involved in the show include Sarah Silverman , Jack Black and Brian Posehn. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:11:48.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
