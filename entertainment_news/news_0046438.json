With no shortage of colorful paint and sparkles, Shaw gave Campanario a hands-on art lesson while sharing tips on becoming a successful professional artist. Campanario's artwork was put on display at Mars Gallery during a Big Dreamers event in Chicago .\n\"I couldn't be more thrilled for Gabriella. At a young age she already has tremendous creativity and an amazing sense of personal style, and she reminds me that we should never stop dreaming big,\" said Shaw. \"I wanted to get involved because I know what it feels like to have big dreams and how much it means to have someone to look up to. Now Gabriella has the opportunity to make her dreams come to life, and I'm so glad I got to be a part of her journey.\"\n\"Ella has always been a big dreamer, and I'm over the moon that she can look up to Dallas as a mentor,\" said Agostinho Campanario . \"We were so grateful to have spent time with Dallas in Chicago.
