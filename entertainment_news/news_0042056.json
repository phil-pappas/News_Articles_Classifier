Instead she put her extraordinary voice in the service of other artists, touring and recording as a backup singer with stars such as Luther Vandross, Chaka Khan, Roberta Flack and the Rolling Stones. RJ MUNA/ALONZO KING LINES BALLET Choreographer Alonzo King says he was keen on working with Lisa Fischer after seeing her in the film \"20 Feet From Stardom,\" and her \"being fascinated by people creating things together that couldnâ t do by themselves.â ( ak ) \nKing said he was moved by both her sound and unaffected screen persona: \"Her humility in talking about how being a star was not her goal, but being fascinated by people creating things together that couldn't do by themselves.\" \nKing got in touch with Fischer's agent and invited her to see his company LINES Ballet perform in New York City. Afterwords they met backstage \"and talked all night,\" King said, an encounter that laid the groundwork for their evening-length collaboration \"The Propelled Heart,\" which premieres Nov. 6-15 at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater. Advertisement \nHer connection with LINES is just the latest door opened for Fischer by \"20 Feet,\" a film celebrating the African-American women backup singers who have provided the Anglosphere's popular music with so much heart and soul over the past five decades. Nearly 25 years after refusing the music industry's blandishments, Fischer started touring widely with Grand Baton, an improvisation-laced trio led by French multi-instrumentalist JC Maillard. \nMaillard and Fischer will be on stage throughout \"The Propelled Heart,\" which features rock hits she's reinvented with Grand Baton and original songs she and Maillard have created for the production. She's been rehearsing in San Francisco with King and LINES on the intensive collaboration. \n\"We're working like crazy to meet this deadline,\" King said. \"We have a lot of her material, songs I've chosen and songs that she's offered. The dancers are also singing with Lisa, and by themselves. They have great voices. In the meantime, we've been in touch nonstop through telephone, email and video.\" \nNothing better captures Fischer's commitment to creative growth than her alliance with Maillard and Grand Baton. Rather than putting together an R&B revue to trade on the sudden burst of attention following the documentary, she connected with an existing ensemble boasting a volatile synthesis of Caribbean and West African rhythms, jazz and rock. \nGrand Baton came together a year or so before Maillard, a composer, guitarist, pianist and arranger, moved from Paris to New York City in 2006. The group reflects the vision of an artist who was born and raised in the French Caribbean outpost Guadeloupe and came of age musically on Paris's burgeoning jazz and world music scene in the mid-1980s (when he performed widely with Angelique Kidjo). \nFor Fischer, creating something new is an essential part of her creative impulse. She's been engaged with dance throughout her career, but \"this is my first time working with a ballet company,\" she said via email. \"With most of the artists I've toured with, there's usually a choreographer that integrates movement with singing according to the desire and purpose of the artist.\" \nCreating dance in collaboration with renowned musicians is nothing new for King. Indeed, the world-renowned choreographer has made a point of seeking out singular sonic explorers, from tabla maestro Zakir Hussain and oud master Hamza El Din to tenor saxophone titan Pharoah Sanders and percussionist Mickey Hart. \nKing first recalls experiencing the transformational power of music while serving as an altar boy in St. Cyprian's Parish in Columbus, Ohio. As the Gregorian chants swept over the pews, the observant 6-year-old saw the elderly communicants \"so drunk with devotion, it put you in awe,\" he said. \"These people were experiencing something so profound, and you'd hear the commitment of the singers with this Eastern-meets-Western sound of the chanting. There was an alchemy there in the room, a transformation that was evocative and important.\" \nNow King has ushered Fischer into a different kind of exalted space. Always looking for creative communion, she's found a new way to unleash the power of her voice. Rather than standing 20 feet from the action, she's surrounded by it, creating the score for the LINES dancers to explore the intricacies of human relationships. \n\"I watch the dancers move and breathe in that special place they inhabit as creative spirits and as I take it all in, I think to myself 'Wow, we express it differently but the source is the same,,\" she wrote. \"It's such a thrill!\" Contact Andrew Gilbert at jazzscribe@aol.com .
