It previously played at the American Repertory Theater at Harvard. \nIt will be directed by Diane Paulus, who has also helmed the recent revival of \"Pippin\" and the new \"Finding Neverland.\" Bareilles, who wrote the music and lyrics, is behind such hits as \"King of Anything\" and \"Love Song.\" \n\"Waitress,\" which starred Keri Russell in the film, tells the story of a waitress and pie maker trapped in a small-town diner and a loveless marriage. The musical has a story by Jessie Nelson, who wrote, directed and produced \"Corrina, Corrina\" with Whoopi Goldberg and \"I Am Sam\" with Sean Penn. \nMueller's other Broadway credits include \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\" with Harry Connick Jr., \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" and \"Nice Work If You Can Get It.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:25:58.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
