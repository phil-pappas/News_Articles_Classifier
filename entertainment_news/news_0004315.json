She dismisses rumor that she battled cancer and, in the process, admits to having kidney stones. \"It is true that I had kidney stones. I had them removed three weeks ago and I am doing just fine!\" the country music icon said. \"There is absolutely no truth at all that I have stomach cancer. I love and appreciate everyone's concern.\" The \"Jolene\" hitmaker is now back to work. \"Last week I was at Dollywood filming parts for my new movie ' Coat of Many Colors ', which premieres December 10th on NBC. With the 30th Anniversary of Dollywood, I did a full week of activities promoting my new DreamMore Resort's opening,\" she revealed. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:46:49.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
