Following the performance, the Village Voice declared, \"Issue a warrant for Demi Lovato 'cause girl murdered 'Saturday Night Live,'\" adding, \"Lovato's full-throttle vocal assault on the Studio 8H stage with (\"Confident\") could service as a career standout for her.\"\nDemi will perform songs from the critically acclaimed new album on \"Good Morning America\" ( Oct. 29 ) as well as \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon \" ( Oct. 30 ). Critical praise for Lovato's CONFIDENT has been equally stellar. Billboard Magazine asserted, \" Demi Lovato has become one of pop's leading motivational figures,\" while People Magazine lauded, \"It's Lovato's dynamite vocals and striking vulnerability on aching ballads and gospel anthems that make CONFIDENT such a triumph,\" and USA Today avowed, \"She inarguably has one of the strongest instruments in pop right now.\"\nIsland Records Artist, Nick Jonas introduced himself as a fully formed solo artist on his hit self-titled debut, released in November 2014 . The critically-acclaimed album includes double-platinum smash single and #1 U.S. radio hit, \"Jealous\" and his sultry second chart-climbing radio single, \"Chains.\" Jonas attributes his album's darker overtones partially to the fact that while he was recording, he was also shooting the gritty television show 'Kingdom' - a mixed martial arts drama that premiered on DirecTV's Audience Network last fall and was recently picked up for two additional seasons. Jonas recently earned two more high-profile roles, a guest starring role in Fox's horror-comedy series, 'Scream Queens' and a lead in the James Franco produced film, 'Goat'. Showing no signs of slowing down this year, the breakout solo powerhouse joined forces with west coast rapper-producer Sage the Gemini to release their summer collaboration, \"Good Thing.\" Jonas' latest single, \"Levels,\" has already amassed over 12 million views on YouTube and is rapidly climbing the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He also recently wrapped up his sold-out North American \"LIVE IN CONCERT\" tour and has been nominated for a 2015 American Music Award for Favorite Male Artist – Pop/Rock.\nFUTURE NOW: THE TOUR\n*All dates, cities and venues below subject to change.\nFriday, June 24, 2016\nSunrise, FL\nBB&T Center\nSaturday, June 25, 2016\nOrlando, FL\nAmway Center\nWednesday, June 29, 2016\nAtlanta, GA\nPhilips Arena\nThursday, June 30, 2016\nCharlotte, NC\nTime Warner Cable Arena\nSaturday, July 2, 2016\nRaleigh, NC\nPNC Arena\nSunday, July 3, 2016\nVirginia Beach, VA\nFarm Bureau Live at Virginia Beach\nWednesday, July 6, 2016\nUncasville, CT\nMohegan Sun Arena\nFriday, July 8, 2016\nBrooklyn, NY\nBarclays Center\nTuesday, July 12, 2016\nNewark, NJ\nPrudential Center\nThursday, July 14, 2016\nCamden, NJ\nSusquehanna Bank Center\nSaturday, July 16, 2016\nHershey, PA\nHersheypark Stadium\nSunday, July 17, 2016\nBuffalo, NY\nFirst Niagara Center\nWednesday, July 20, 2016\nBoston, MA\nTD Garden\nFriday, July 22, 2016\nMontreal, QC\nBell Centre\nSaturday, July 23, 2016\nToronto, ON\nAir Canada Centre\nTuesday, July 26, 2016\nWashington, DC\nVerizon Center\nWednesday, July 27, 2016\nColumbus, OH\nSchottenstein Center\nFriday, July 29, 2016\nLouisville, KY\nKFC Yum!
