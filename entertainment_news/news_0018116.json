An online petition, \" Save Bubbles the Dog ,\" garnered nearly 2,500 signatures, and almost 1,000 members were added to a closed Facebook group called \" Save Bubbles .\"\n\"We're trying to get more people aware of this,\" said Debbie Szenda, who started the Facebook group and initiated the petition. For the past year, Szenda was part of the shelter's Behavior Intervention Team volunteer group that, since May, provided Bubbles with extra attention and training.\nAngela Johnson, of Ceasers Heaven Animal Rescue in Harvard, said she offered to take Bubbles in and provide her with a home. She said she visited Anderson and interacted with Bubbles, who cooperated and listened to commands.\nJohnson wanted Bubbles to experience life outside a shelter, where people could love and care for her, she said.\n\"I believe every dog should be given a chance, and I don't believe this dog has been given the appropriate and well deserved chance,\" Johnson said.\nBut Drake said she could not morally or legally release the dog without an expert's recommendation.\nThe shelter hired Dr. John Ciribassi, an animal behaviorist with Carol Stream-based Chicagoland Veterinary Behavior Consultants, to evaluate Bubbles' behavior Tuesday and make a recommendation for how to move forward, she said.\n\"Although it was not an easy decision and despite repeated efforts and methods employed by veteran and well-trained staff and volunteers at Anderson to provide enrichment and positive reinforcement training, the report conducted by ... Dr. Ciribassi left no other choice than to euthanize Bubbles,\" the Anderson website said.\nSzenda and Johnson were among several petitioners who said the claims of Bubbles' aggression were not substantiated because no written documentation or proof has been provided.\nThe first bite was not documented, which was not the correct protocol, Drake said. However, the most recent bite was reported to Kane County Animal Control, she said.\nOfficials with the Kane County Health Department said bite reports are only made available through requests under the Freedom of Information Act, which can take up to five days.\n\"Any policies that were not completely followed have all been addressed,\" Drake said. \"I am dedicated to ensuring that anything like this does not happen again.\"\n News South Elgin Pets and Animals", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/1620590258214695/", "https://www.change.org/p/petitioning-jonathan-gripe-president-of-anderson-animal-shelter-in-s-elgin-illinois-cindy-green-vice-president-of-anderson-animal-shelter-elgin-illinois-and-all-staff-at-anderson-animal-she-save-bubbles-the-dog-in-risk-of-wrongful-euthanas?recruiter=190118411&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive&rp_sharecordion_checklist=control#petition-letter", "https://twitter.com/share", "http://www.andersonanimalshelter.org/#!bubbles/c1rcb"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:41:26.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
