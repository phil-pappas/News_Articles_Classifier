Krishna said she is fine with everything the media had to say or comment about the photo shoot but she had one issue regarding the coverage. She said, “I just have one issue. With the word ‘topless’. I think that’s ridiculous because to be topless, you have to show nipple. I just think that it’s a little backward when it comes to things like this. No offence to anyone but people today cant really be free or express themselves however they want to because of the amount of judgement that happens these days. I just feel the society is a little backwards.” Adding further over the buzzing modelling and acting prospects which have mushroomed after the pictures being appreciated by many, Krishna said she is unaware of the modelling world.
