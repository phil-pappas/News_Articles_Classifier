Scheduled for October 31, at Mehboob Studio, it salutes our passion for cinema which has, over the years, influenced Indian fashion, music, and even shaped our weddings.\nThe Jio MAMI Movie Mela promises to be the ultimate movie fan experience which India currently lacks and seeks to enhance our understanding of our cinema. The day-long festivities offer a master class with Rishi Kapoor, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi talking about their collaboration, which has created a string of top grossers, food stalls and merchandise shops, figurines of characters we love and dubsmash zones and a Movie Mela. The highlight of the Mela is the Mr India Reunion which has the cast and crew take the audience on a journey through the making of one of India's best-loved films revolving around an invisible man.\nTwenty-eight years later, Anil Kapoor remembers that he was treated like an invisible hero literally by the 'trimurti' of producer Boney Kapoor, director Shekhar Kapur and DOP Baba Azmi who were completely besotted with the film's heroine, Sridevi, who was the huge star then. \"I was an established actor but it was Mr India, Tezaab, Eeshwar, Ram Lakhan, Karma and Parinda which made me the numero uno star. During the 'Kaate Nahin Katate' song shoot, I was treated like a junior artiste rather than the film's leading man who had to beg, plead, threaten, sulk and fight for one close-up, which would be taken at 4 am. The trio was obsessed with her and she was a pro, filming the rain song when she was burning with fever,\" Anil reminisces a quarter of a century later.\nHowever, despite the \"exploitation\", his jacket, distinctive stubble and hat made him the quintessential Mr India. \"I am called Lakhan, Jhakaas, Ae ji O ji, Munna and now Majnu bhai, but even today, I'm introduced as Mr India. Like all Indians, my character, Arun Verma, was humble, approachable, down-to-earth and will do anything for his country, and that forged a bond with the audience. There's a lot of me in Arun too,\" he admits.\nAmrish Puri has become synonymous with Mogambo and his catchline, \"Mogambo khush hua\", become a patent dialogue of Hindi cinema. \"I worked with four actors in the maximum films— Madhuri Dixit, Jackie Shroff, Anupam Kher and Amrish Puri. With the latter, I did almost a dozen films. He was lovable and humble, and like me, hard-working and sincere. We were friends though he was years older,\" says Anil.\nHe also remembers the children, in particular 'shy, quiet boy' Aftab Shivdasani, who today surprises him by acting in sex comedies like the Masti series, and Rakesh Nath's son Karan, who is \"so big and good looking' today. Buzz is, Anil will turn up for the reunion in his Mr India suit. The actor admits that he hasn't made up his mind yet but it is possible that he might wear it. It still fits but, he admits, he might look a little stupid wearing such an outdated suit.\n\"We brought it out when the Mr India ride was being launched at Manmohan Shetty's amusement park, Imagica. Bijon Dasgupta, who was the production designer and art director of the film, suggested they get hold of the costume and believed that I might have it,\" says Anil. He did. It was lying at his home.\nFor over two decades we've been waiting for the sequel. Will Mr India 2 make an appearance in 2016? \"We don't know if it will next year, but it will definitely come before we bid adieu to the world,\" he signs off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:07:57.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
