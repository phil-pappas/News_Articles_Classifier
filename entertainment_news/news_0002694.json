The companies have issued a statement to debunk his arguments about the products being \"poison for kids.\" In a Monday, October 12 interview with the \"Dennis & Callahan Morning Show\", Brady made the remarks while defending his business partner, life coach, and nutritionist Alex Guerrero. Reportedly claiming to be a doctor, Guerrero was banned by the Federal Trade Commission after admitting to faking a study that said his Supreme Greens supplement cured terminal illnesses like cancer, Multiple Sclerosis and AIDS. Brady had his own thoughts about what's harmful out there. \"I think we've been lied to by a lot of food companies over the years, by a lot of beverage companies over the years,\" the father of three said. \"But we still [believe] it. That's just America, and that's what we've been conditioned... We believe that Frosted Flakes is a food... of course they taste very good. And of course all those companies make lots of money selling those things. They have lots of money to advertise... That's the education that we get. That's what we get brainwashed to believe, that all these things are just normal food groups, and this is what you should eat.\" Brady also took a jab at Coca-Cola drink company whom he once worked for as a spokesperson for its Smartwater brand. \"I disagree with a lot of things that people tell you to do,\" the New England Patriots quarterback said. \"You'll probably go out and drink Coca-Cola and think, 'Oh yeah, that's no problem.' Why? Because they pay lots of money for advertisements to think that you should drink Coca-Cola for a living? No, I totally disagree with that. And when people do that, I think that's quackery. And the fact that they can sell that to kids? I mean, that's poison for kids. But they keep doing it.\" According to reports, Brady practices disciplined eating habits, which include eating kale and collards for breakfast, and raw macaroons and avocado-based ice cream for desserts. Guerrero recommends such healthy food as brown rice, yeast free bread and veggie omelets for breakfast. Kellogg Co. responded in a statement to Us Weekly, \"Cereal is a delicious and nutritious breakfast. Numerous studies show that a cereal breakfast is associated with lower BMIs (body mass index) in both children and adults. As a matter of fact, a serving of Frosted Flakes with skim milk has just 150 calories and delivers valuable nutrients including calcium, B vitamins, and iron.\" Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said, \"All of our beverages are safe and can be enjoyed as part of a balanced lifestyle. We offer more than 200 low- and no-calorie beverages in the U.S. and Canada and a wide variety of smaller portion sizes of our regular drinks. As a responsible beverage company and marketer, we prominently provide calorie and sugar information for our beverages so people can choose what makes sense for them and their families.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:23:03.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
