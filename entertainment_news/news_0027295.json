This marks the fourth year NYCB has collaborated with fashion designers to create costumes for individual ballets. NYCB board member Sarah Jessica Parker conceived the idea several years ago, and in 2012, Valentino was the first designer to design costumes in collaboration with choreographers at NYCB. This year, Peter Copping of Oscar de la Renta, Hanako Maeda of Adeam, Humberto Leon of Opening Ceremony and Kenzo, Zuhair Murad, and Marta Marques and Paolo Almeida of Marques Almeida brought forth their personal fashion touches.\"It was a challenge, because I wasn't designing fashion,\" said Copping, who worked alongside NYCB Ballet Master In Chief Peter Martins for the ballet he choreographed, Thou Swell . \"This had a different set of rules. It was very much a collaboration between Oscar de la Renta and NYCB. Their team is fantastic; I really listened to them and had a lot to learn. I wanted it to reflect the house of Oscar de la Renta, and it was very glamorous, very lavish - all that Oscar loved. I feel proud and rewarded by the result.\"Guests, including Jennifer Hudson, Rose McGowan, Jill Kargman, Fe Fendi and Donya Bommer enjoyed a pre-performance reception featuring Ruinart champagne, the official champagne of NYCB. Parker and philanthropist Adrienne Arsht chaired the evening.

But we have to take chances. We ended up being pretty lucky. They came up with some wonderful works.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:41:26.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
