She ultimately concludes that she’s “over” finding adorable ways to state her opinion. \nLenny is a recently launched weekly newsletter from Lena Dunham and her “Girls” executive producer Jenni Konner. \n—", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:01:42.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
