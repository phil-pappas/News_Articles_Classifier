The play tries to understand what people lose and what they get. Is it self-identity and anonymity or freedom? What is the first problem they face? Is it language, food or being seen like an outsider? When people get displaced, it's not just the people but, their culture also that shifts from once place to other. This play consists of two parallel stories, one is of people who have come to a new city for better career prospects and the other is of people who are about to leave their place as it is getting evacuated. One story is set in Delhi and the other in the coal mines of Dhanbad.\nThe play is written by Sandeep Shikhar and directed by Amit Sharma, while artistes are Abhinav Kimothi, Danish Khan, Daisy Hookens, Manoj Pandey, Surya Raizada, Siddhesh Dharmadhikari, Dev Singh, Shahbaz Khan and Gautam Mehta.\nIt is scheduled to be staged on October 17 (3.30 and 7.30 pm) at Ranga Shankara, 36/2 8th Cross II Phase, JP Nagar.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/emotions/play"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:44:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
