Jordan) never knew his famous father, world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born. Still, there's no denying that boxing is in his blood, so Adonis heads to Philadelphia, the site of Apollo Creed's legendary match with a tough upstart named Rocky Balboa. Once in the City of Brotherly Love, Adonis tracks Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) down and asks him to be his trainer. Despite his insistence that he is out of the fight game for good, Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo -- the fierce rival who became his closest friend. Agreeing to take him on, Rocky trains the young fighter, even as the former champ is battling an opponent more deadly than any he faced in the ring. With Rocky in his corner, it isnÂ’t long before Adonis gets his own shot at the title ... but can he develop not only the drive but also the heart of a true fighter, in time to get into the ring? Creed stars Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Wood Harris, Anthony 'Tony' Bellew, Graham McTavish Release: November 25th, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:08:03.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
