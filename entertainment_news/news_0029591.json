Melissa Benoist seems custom-made to play the lead role, so easily does she convey the character’s surprising wide emotional range. Kara Danvers is a shy, bumbling romantic-comedy lead, while Supergirl is brave and full of resolve; Benoist makes them seem like natural parts of one whole person, a rare feat in the superhero-acting business.\nIf “Supergirl” becomes a hit, it will be because America falls in love with Benoist. If not, it will be because the rest of the series is so plain.\nCalista Flockhart does offer a bit of sharp comic relief as Cat Grant, Kara’s boss, but everything else is forgettable: rote supervillains, the obligatory secret government agency and a set of superpowers for Kara that conveniently are just enough to solve every problem.\nVerdict: Skip that\nWATCH THIS “How to Dance in Ohio,” 9 p.m. HBO This documentary, which earned strong reviews at the Sundance Film Festival, makes its television debut. Marideth, 16, Caroline, 19, and Jessica, 22, all are on the autism spectrum, and all are planning to attend a formal dance. The film follows them as they push far outside their comfort zones under the encouragement of their psychologist. “How to Dance in Ohio” is heartwarming without being sticky.\nSKIP THAT “Fear: Buried Alive,” 8 p.m. A&E The trend of live stunts takes a turn toward the gimmicky with this special, which feels like an awful lot like a live edition of “Fear Factor.” Three people agree to be sealed in coffins and buried underground, with cameras monitoring their reactions. Depending on your provider, you may be able to catch this genuinely live at 5 p.m.; otherwise it will be taped for the West Coast, but presumably not edited.\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:21:28.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
