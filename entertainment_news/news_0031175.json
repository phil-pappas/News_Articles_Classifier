Another seemingly Oscar-bait picture that included a star-studded cast re-enacting a non-fiction book set in World War II.\nGeorge Clooney directed this film about a group that has to find and save culturally important art from the Nazis before its destroyed.\nDespite a cast that included Clooney, Murray, Matt Damon, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett, \"Monuments\" only drew 31% positive reviews and no awards recognition, though it did make $150 million at the box office.\n\"Aloha\"\nThis film seemingly falls into a category of projects that Murray chose either because they involved prior collaborators he liked or they included people who have done good work (unless it turns out to not be the Coen brother you think it is).\nCameron Crowe's \"Aloha,\" which starred an ensemble cast including Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Alec Baldwin and other big stars, scored a paltry 19% on Rotten Tomatoes and couldn't recoup its $37 million budget.\n\"Passion Play\"\nA movie written and directed by Mitch Glazer, the same man who wrote and directed \"Rock the Kasbah,\" flopped for Murray long before this current bomb.\nMurray plays a ruthless gangster trying to harm an angel played by Megan Fox. Mickey Rourke starred as the trumpet player trying to save him.\nThis did not pan out with critics - who hated it ( 3% on Rotten Tomatoes! ) - and audiences, who didn't see it. The film made less than $3,000 at the box office.\n\"Hamlet\"\nThis is not the 1996 Kenneth Brannagh-directed version of \"Hamlet,\" but a modernized take on the Shakespeare tale, set in New York City.\nThe movie came out in 2000 and starred Ethan Hawke as Hamlet, with Murray playing the smaller role of Polonius.\nWhile it drew a somewhat respectable 55% on Rotten Tomatoes , it bombed at the box office to the tune of $2 million in returns.\nslepore@nydailynews.com\nTags: news break , lists , bill murray", "external_links": ["http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rock_the_kasbah/", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/larger_than_life/?search=Larger%20Than%20Life", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4xX5vuxOaY", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/?search=Space%20Jam", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqQzNyxSShM", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10002516-lost_city/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3mf_ewjc7s", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWijct7LzAE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMOE5OVwWDE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CreneTs7sGs", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_glimpse_inside_the_mind_of_charles_swan_iii/?search=A%20Glimpse", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hyde_park_on_hudson/?search=Hyde", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/F39CYBE6-Kg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hqd2k0-UTHQ", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1097245-hamlet/", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_monuments_men/?search=The%20Monuments", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpICtcvRnNw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYuZnqyIgHg", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/garfield_2/?search=Garfie", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/aloha_2015/", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passion_play/?search=Passion%20Play"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:05:12.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
