The publication reported that the former One Direction member texted Perrie and said he still loved her. A source told the publication, \"Zayn has started messaging Perrie again saying he misses and still loves her.\" Despite the romantic text, Zayn hadn't declared that he wanted to get back together with Perrie. \"So far they haven't met up and Zayn hasn't actually said he wants to get back together, just that he misses her,\" the source explained. Regarding the situation, \"[Perrie's] friends are worried if he begs her to take him back she could crumble.\" On the other hand, Perrie was seemingly still in love with Zayn. \"Although Perrie is trying to be strong and move on, it's obvious to everyone around her she's still in love with Zayn,\" the source explained. Following their split, Zayn was romantically linked to some girls including Zendaya Coleman , Burberry model Neelam Gill and Lily Allen . Most recently, he posted on Instagram a picture of him cuddling a blonde girl named Carlyn Bryan in late September. The picture was then removed from the social media. Perrie, meanwhile, was rumored dating the alum of \"The Only Way Is Essex\", Joey Essex, after her split from Zayn. However, a rep for the Little Mix member denied the rumors she's dating Joey. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:49:27.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
