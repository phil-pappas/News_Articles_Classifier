A steal, right?\nThe replica houses a Corvette V8 5.7 engine, and more than 500 horsepower. It's estimated that it can get up to 250km per hour, but despite that it's still legal to register it on UAE roads.\nJust like in the movies, once the vehicle hits a certain speed the front lifts up to create that spider-like effect. The wheels are 44 inches high in the back, and 18.5 in the front, with gull-wing doors that open from the bottom up.\nThere's cameras placed around the car to give the driver view of the blind spots, and there's even a switch to fire flames out the engine, which is mounted at the back of the car. We hope for the sake of other road users that that's not legal, although it would be a handy deterrent for people who think that driving to feet behind you is acceptable.\nThe cars owner has already had interest from the US, Germany, France and Switzerland, and hopes to use the funds to bring the latest Batmobile to the market.\nVia Mashable\nMORE: Watch: The honest trailer for Batman: Arkham Knight is all about the Batmobile\nMORE: Christian Bale and Michael Mann will reteam for biopic Ferrari\nMORE: How to incorporate these classic pieces into your Winter wardrobe", "external_links": ["http://mashable.com/2015/10/20/batman-tumbler-batmobile-sale/#Xkweu2olG5qc"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:04:20.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
