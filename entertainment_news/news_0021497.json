It's either that, or it has something to do with being given more attention in the early years, so they're getting taught better.\nSee, they're not even sure about it themselves, so how can we trust it. Best just forget about it all now.\nIf you haven't already figured it out, just about everyone in the office is the youngest in their family, so forgive our bias.\nThe research, which was carried out by Germans scientists, studied the IQ levels of over 20,000 people from Germany, the US, and the UK, eventually finding a drop off of about 1.5 IQ points per child when it came to birth order.\nStill laughing, oldest siblings? Well have some of this. The research also says that older siblings are more likely to be overweight, but we won't get into statistics because that's just. Lets just say it's a lot more than 1.5 points.\n..\n..\nIt's 29%!!\nVia Irish Independent and Metro\nMORE: US study found a huge benefit for men who sleep naked\nMORE: Science says running can get you as high as smoking weed\nMORE: Study shows Irish women prefer kitchens, sofas, and beds to expensive wedding rings", "external_links": ["http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/20/first-born-children-are-more-intelligent-and-its-thanks-to-nurture-not-nature-5449901/", "http://www.independent.ie/life/family/family-features/first-born-children-are-more-intelligent-than-their-siblings-research-reveals-34128852.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:59:32.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
