Pic/Shadab Khan \nSanjay will be soon seen in the forthcoming film 'Shaandaar', helmed by Bahl. The actor says one of the main reasons for him to do the film was the director.\n\"When I was doing the shooting during the wrap-up day of 'Tevar', which I was producing...I got a call from Vikas. It's great to shoot with him because of his knowledge of today's cinema. He's one of the top directors of the country,\" Sanjay told IANS.\nThe \"Raja\" actor added that Bahl \"has got a lot of sensibility of cinema and that it was a pleasure shooting with him.\"\nSanjay, who will be seen playing a Sindhi business tycoon in the film, was tutored by director Tarun Mansukhani in the dialect and the nuances of the language.\n\"Yeah, he (Mansukhani) tutored me for the dialect because he's a proper Sindhi. I and Vikas went in for two to three days, where we sat with him and then he spoke the dialogues in Sindhi style. But we have not made the character total Sindhi,\" he said.\n'Shaandaar', which stars Alia Bhatt, Shahid Kapoor and Pankaj Kapur, also marks the debut of Sanah Kapoor - Shahid's half-sister and daughter of Pankaj and Supriya Pathak - in the film.\nTalking about working with them, Sanjay said: \"Everyone knows about Pankaj and Shahid... how talented they are. But who really surprised me was Sanah inspite this being her first film.\"\n\"I think the most difficult part for an actor is to perform in front of the family. Acting itself is a tough job, but she surprised me. She was really very good,\" said the actor-producer Anil Kapoor's brother.\n\"Shaandaar\" will hit the screens on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:36.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
