An employees' union wrote a letter asking that she be removed from the post. TERRY PIERSON, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » An employees union is calling on Moreno Valley Mayor Jesse Molina to remove a controversial activist volunteering for him because it alleges she has created a hostile workplace at City Hall.\nMolina fired back this week, accusing City Manager Michelle Dawson and Assistant City Manager Tom DeSantis of orchestrating the Moreno Valley Management Association’s complaint.\nIn a Sept. 22 letter, the group made up of 77 mid-management employees – but not top administrators such as Dawson or DeSantis – stated it may take legal action over Molina’s recent appointment of Vivian Moreno as an administrative volunteer.\n“The MVMA requests that the council take immediate action to protect our members against continuing attacks on their characters at the workplace,” the letter states.\nThe group accuses Moreno of making defamatory comments at city public meetings and online against employees – including one in particular – in what it described as “cyberbullying.”\nMolina and Moreno denied she has created any problems at City Hall and say some city employees don’t like the fact that they’re seeking more answers about city finances and requesting public documents.\n“I think the letter was coaxed by top management,” Molina said Monday, mentioning Dawson and DeSantis as the high-level administrators.\nMolina said he’s been frustrated in efforts to get information from city officials for a long time.\nDawson said she learned of the letter at the same time as Molina, when they were emailed the employees group’s letter.\n“I didn’t see it prior to that,” she said. “I didn’t initiate it. I didn’t have anything to do with composing that.”\nDawson declined to address specifics in the letter but, as she has at recent council meetings, defended city officials.\n“My position as the leader of our team is I don’t appreciate public attacks on our city staff,” she said.\nDeSantis could not be reached for comment.\nBACKGROUND OF ACTIVISM\nMoreno’s appointment in August raised eyebrows among some, who questioned her qualifications to be a top aide to the mayor. A skin care facialist who lives in Riverside, Moreno has no background in public policy or government.\nShe has attracted controversy as a watchdog at Riverside City Hall. She has leveled accusations against city officials at public meetings in Riverside and other cities and on her blog. In one case, she accused a Riverside official of using inappropriate romantic relationships to get promotions, a comment that was criticized by a top administrator as “a new low.”\nIn February, Sheriff’s deputies removed her from a Menifee City Council meeting after she argued with officials over her free speech rights.\nMoreno became involved in Moreno Valley city politics earlier this year. At one meeting in June, she criticized the hiring of Julie Reyes, a program manager overseeing recycling and solid waste, and questioned her qualifications.\nSince she began working for Molina, Moreno said she has not spoken during council public comments.\nThough Reyes is not named in the union’s letter, it cites a “vendetta” against one employee. In a letter written by the group’s labor consultant, the group notes that Dawson and other city employees have criticized attacks on city employees at council meetings and called the allegations incorrect.\n“In summary, our clients believe that Ms. Moreno’s presence in City Hall interferes with the daily conduct of business in this workplace. Her negativity, her personal attacks on specific employees, and her divisive statements about the city’s goals, about our city council members, and about our staff, has created a hostile work environment.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvhpm-b88532475z.120151007160847000g2eceh8e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvhpm-b88532475z.120151007160847000g2eceh8e.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvhpn-b88532475z.120151007160847000gh7ceqfp.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvhpn-b88532475z.120151007160847000gh7ceqfp.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:18:43.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
