Cosby's publicist and attorneys didn't immediately return messages Thursday. \nThe woman claims she was 16 when she met Cosby during a talent search in 1983 for an educational children's television show, \"Picture Pages.\" \nShe says Cosby hired her and soon after began flying her to cities where he was performing. There, he'd give her alcohol she believes was laced with drugs and molest her in hotel rooms. \nShe also says statements Cosby issued questioning the honesty of his various accusers defamed her. \nThe AP doesn't normally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly.
