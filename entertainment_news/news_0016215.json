Wrobel has been painting professionally since she graduated college and will host a discussion and gallery show at Laramie County Community College on Oct. 19.She said she plans to discuss the artistic process and art history.\"Art is a process,\" she said. \"It's not about the finished product - it's about the journey.\"She said she tries to make the discussions dynamic and engaging.The exhibit of her paintings, on display at LCCC Oct. 19-Nov. 23, are \"inspired by what the mind experiences during meditation, prayer and relaxed attentiveness.\"Wrobel said although she wasn't born in Poland, she has spent a good portion of her life there. She would travel there for summers to see the family who still lives there. Her parents immigrated to the United States in the 1980s, and Wrobel was born in California.She grew up speaking Polish, and her early drawings came from being in preschool and kindergarten and not being able to communicate with other children. Now, she predominantly works with oil paintings but still loves to draw and use watercolors when she travels.\"For me, water coloring is almost as important as drawing,\" she said. \"I consider it like visual journaling. I consider painting a meditative experience.\"Drawing and painting has always been a passion for her. She said she draws inspiration from a number of things, but history is a big factor in her work.\"I look to history a lot for inspiration,\" she said. \"Not just art history, which I think is important for artists, but family history and what kind of came before.\" \"Portals to Kairos\" show A collection of Natalia Wrobel paintings at Laramie County Community College When: Oct. 19-Nov. 23 Where: Esther and John Clay Fine Arts Gallery, Laramie County Community College, 1400 E.
