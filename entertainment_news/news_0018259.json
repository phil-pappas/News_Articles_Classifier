Every part of me wants to be here.\"\nDave (not Davey) won the group date at the carnival. \nMoments later the news of Davey's departure was broken to the other men and the rose ceremony was cancelled.\nThe episode began with a group date. Alex, Sasha, Dave, Davey and Michael were invited into a carnival-themed showdown for some more solo time with Frost, a 26-year-old marketing professional from Victoria.\n\"I will crawl over your dead bodies to win this,\" said Michael.\nRichie breaks down recalling the timewarp date. \nActivities included Thunder God, a test of brute strength in which Davey reigned supreme. \n\"Davey is being quite the boy's boy today which I can't say I'm surprised, but I can't help wonder if that was just a brief encounter\" Sam observed.\nBy the fifth and final round only Dave and Davey were left standing.

I feel like I'm the only girl in the world and that's what everyone dreams for\".\nThe pair also bonded over having divorced parents and how that has stunted their ability to imagine longevity in relationships.\n\"I guess I've been so scared of thinking in this day and age that people can't have long term marriages,\" Sam said.\nThe date ended with a video message from Richie's mum and sister, sharing stories from his childhood and youth, a kiss and Richie receiving a rose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:50:13.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
