The show, titled \"Here & There,\" which is comprised of 20 pieces, continues through November 6. \nTopp is largely self-taught, although he did study as a high school student with Robert Hoffman while the latter artist was in-residence at Syracuse University in the 1970s and their paths reconnected when Topp was in his 20s. Topp joined the city of Syracuse's Department of Parks and Recreation and Youth Program in 1987 as a graphic artist, later supervising the city's successful Community Murals Program, which painted life-sized murals in public areas such as senior citizen centers. He left the Syracuse area in 2008, relocating to Harrisburg, but it seems the call of home recently brought him back to Central New York. \nThe pieces on view in the current exhibition are comprised of landscapes, cityscapes, narratives, and a portrait, which bear the influences of artists who inspired Topp, including N.C. Wyeth , Norman Rockwell , and Maxfield Parrish . In addition to these strongly representational paintings, there is also a quasi-abstract pastel titled simply, \"Still Life,\" which Topp has described as an \"exploration of color and texture in a composition without narrative.\" The piece is a study of folds, shadows and draping that demonstrates an accomplished command over technique and medium. The one portrait in the show, a pastel titled, \"Dr. Richard Chiang,\" is one of Topp's looser works, demonstrating a more gestural hand and taking greater liberties with colors. \nMost of the pieces are of a modest scale,(16\" x 20\") although there is one large (4' x 7') painting titled, \"The Performers,\" which proves Topp is capable of handling large-format compositions as deftly as the smaller works. The strongly narrative piece depicts a group of eight elderly musicians in what appears to be a rehearsal, but there is a touch of surrealism, or irony to the piece reminiscent of a painting by Jerome Witkin. One performer wears a fireman's hat and a clown's nose while another holds a stuffed bear on this lap. Topp captures the moment in all of its bizarre swing. \nThe scenes of Central New York are largely landscapes, capturing the rolling contours of the terrain and the lush colors and vegetation that cover it. Some of the pieces bear titles of specific locations, such as \"Otisco from Willowdale,\" and \"From Lord's Pond,\" while others take more generic titles, such as \"View North,\" and \"Autumn with Fire Pond.\" \nAll of these paintings show a capacity for embracing the myriad variations of light and shadow that characterize our region. Topp has described his process as \"building up parts of a composition as the light changes, keeping a number of plates spinning at the same time.\" What we see is the synergy of this changing light captured within a single composition. \nThe paintings of Harrisburg feature both the heart of the city and its suburban fringes. In \"Capitol, Harrisburg,\" Topp portrays the state capitol building in a complex composition that captures the density of urban life. In \"Market Street Bridge,\" we see the bridge's iconic arches as it crosses the Susquehanna River; a pair of kayakers enjoying time on the water and a gaggle of geese parading on the shore. In the atmospheric piece titled, \"Winter Twilight, \" Topp captures the river and bridge from above, looking down upon the city through a milky scrim of snow. \nI was not familiar with Topp's work, so this show was a terrific introduction to what he is capable of doing. Now that he has back in Central New York, I will look forward to seeing more of it. \nDetails: \nWhat: \"Here and There: an exhibit of paintings and pastels of landscape and figurative works by Mark Topp\" Where : Wilson Art Gallery in the Falcone Library at Le Moyne College When: Through November 6 Admission: Free Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday; 2 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday; Noon to 8 p.m. Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:32:37.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
