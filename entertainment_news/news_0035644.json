Once production ceased, the cast departed, never to be seen together again. For the most part, that’s stayed true, with many classic TV properties remaining untouched by reboot and relaunch – however, a new trend of additional seasons being picked up for certain shows beyond their initial run seems to be sweeping through – with the increasingly popular on-demand service Netflix helping bring back beloved shows to the fans that miss them. \nWith the news that The Gilmore Girls is to be picked up for an additional season via Netflix, it’s time to cast an eye across what other properties – nationally and internationally – the provider has relaunched in recent history. Perhaps most famously, cult comedy Arrested Development, which many believed to have been underrated, was given an additional lease of life via the streaming service, which – admittedly – launched to mixed reviews. In the UK, popular period mystery Ripper Street saw a third season open to rave reception, allowing the show to regain steam where many believed the BBC had left it hanging. Netflix appears to be doing many viewers a service by bringing back shows and giving them a second lease of life. \nNetflix also picked up the reins for the US interpretation of cult Swedish crime thriller The Killing, along with animation in Dreamworks’ Dragons (based on the popular How To Train franchise) and the continuation of perennially popular Star Wars ’ Clone Wars series. It’s since been confirmed that, over in the UK, the richly dark sci-fi serial Black Mirror will be relaunched for an additional eight episodes, picking up from where Channel 4 left off. While Netflix may not have seized upon the Top Gear cast to bring to their own platform, they certainly seem to know the properties to bring back to the people! \nNetflix’s habit and ability to relaunch old series begs the question – what else could they possibly bring back? Many have called for Netflix to finally bring back long-lost and much-missed sci-fi staple Firefly, which may not be entirely out of the realms of possibility – with fans of Alias, Dollhouse, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and even Lost all clamouring for the chance to see their beloved characters return to the small screen. With so many great shows gone and assumedly forever, what shows would you like to see return via Netflix’s catalogue of once-forgotten wonders? 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:42:30.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
