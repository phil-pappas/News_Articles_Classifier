For those that haven't seen it before, it's set in a small town in the Alps where a number of dead people rose from their graves and started living their lives again. As you do. In tonight's episode, only a few inhabitants have decided to remain in the town in the hope of finding their loved ones taken by the Horde. Still pregnant with Simon's baby, Adele has a fainting spell and is taken to hospital where the staff decide to induce labour. Meanwhile, Richard Berg, an expert tasked with finding the causes of the flood, crosses paths with Toni, who has returned from among the dead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:29:12.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
