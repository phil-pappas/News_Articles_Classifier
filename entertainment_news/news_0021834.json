It was also too pricey.\nMichael Giannattasio started the SALT Makerspace at the Delavan Center on Wyoming Street in Syracuse. Stan Linhorst \"With internet, insurance and rent, it was very expensive,\" said Michael Giannattasio, the SALT Makerspace director. \"We were paying close to $2,200 a month in rent alone.\"\nSo the nonprofit picked up and moved downtown to a smaller, but cheaper situation. The Makerspace reopened on Oct. 1 inside Syracuse Coworks with a new address and a new business model.\nNow, the Makerspace will focus only on workshops for laser cutting, 3-D printing and prototyping tools, operating out of a 400-square-foot private studio in the Syracuse Coworks office.\nIt's a tighter squeeze than the original Makerspace.\nThe former SALT Makerspace in the Delavan Center had a 2,300-square-foot fully-equipped metal and wood shop and a 700-square-foot computer lab. They had space for 3-D printing, laser cutting, woodworking, metalsmithing and more.\nOverhead costs dropped from approximately $4,000 to $500-600 per month at Coworks, but the Makerspace also had to drop its metal and wood shop.\n\"It's not a huge downsize but it's a considerable drop back,\" Giannattasio said. \"A lot of people were disappointed we shut down.\"\nOne of those disappointed artists was Jordan Dudden, the founder of JoJo Rings . She used the metal shop space to fashion old keys into polished rings to sell.\nGiannattasio said the SALT Makerspace helped start up 10 new businesses in the Delavan Center, including JoJo Rings.\nDudden was surprised when the Delavan location closed. She had to temporarily move her operation to her father's garage and her own apartment. Now, she's actively looking for a new space to work in downtown Syracuse.\n\"We're very thankful for the Salt Makerspace as it provided us with a workshop and community to build the foundation of our business,\" Dudden said in an email. \"I sincerely hope they're able to find a viable long-term solution that gives entrepreneurs the tools to make prototypes and test the market.\"\nMaking JoJo Rings at SALT Makerspace Jordan Dudden shows how she recycles old keys into vintage rings at the SALT Makerspace on April 11, 2015. Video by Katrina Tulloch.\nGiannattasio hopes to save enough money (through profits and fundraising) to find a new space for metal and woodworking, in addition to the downtown Coworks space.\n\"We still have all our equipment,\" he said. \"It's all in storage. When we establish with proper financing, we'll be able to pick up where we left off.\"\nThe Makerspace earns money through donations, membership fees, educational workshops and 3-D printing and laser cutting professional services.\nSix Makerspace instructors currently teach workshops on laser cutting, CNC mini routing, even leatherworking.\n\"Someone can walk in and within an hour we can have them making stuff,\" Giannattasio said. \"3-D printing or laser cutting is only truly mystifying when you haven't had your hands on it. Once you've been exposed, you get it.\"\nThough several Makerspace members dropped after the move, Giannattasio says they have gained three new members in the last week.\nNew SALT Makerspace headquarters\nWhere: 201 East Jefferson St., second floor, Suite #200.\nHours: 2 to 10 p.m. from Tuesday to Friday or 10 a.m. â€“ 6 p.m. on Saturday.\nHow much: Anyone can pay $60 for general access to come in during operating hours. After three months, a member can upgrade to unlimited access for $100 per month. Members at that level get a key and can use the equipment 24 hours a day.\nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
