Having its 50-plus luxury managers working in more markets will enable The RealReal to establish more of a personal connection with consumers face-to-face. \nPersonal assistant The RealReal launched its white glove service in 2011. This gives sellers a better idea of the consigning process before they jump in, as the luxury manager can offer estimates on price and also take care of getting the consigned items to one of the marketplace’s warehouses. \n“Everyone is so busy today and The RealReal’s goal is to make it easy to sell your luxury items. Our experienced luxury managers provide an effortless and private way to sell items from the comfort of your home. We are excited to now offer this service in Seattle, San Antonio and Austin,” said The RealReal CEO Julie Wainwright in a statement. \nImage of Natalie Off Duty blogger Natalie Suarez consigning with The RealReal \nTo-date, The RealReal has 4 million members, and has sold 1.5 million items. \nThe marketplace has been working to expand its footprint in the U.S. with the opening of new facilities and points of sale. \nMost recently, The RealReal began its expansion into the bricks-and-mortar space with the opening of a new valuation office in New York. \nThe new location, opened in August, will give consumers the opportunity to have their jewelry and watches evaluated by an expert and obtain a physical valuation document. Having a bricks-and-mortar location may help The RealReal connect with consumers as it looks to expand its presence as a leading consignment authority ( see story ). \nLast year, the ecommerce site also improved operational logistics with a 129,000 square foot warehouse in Seacaucus, NJ ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:44:08.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
