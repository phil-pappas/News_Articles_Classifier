Carlton, has an extensive arrest record, and served time in prison in a 1990 case of robbery and aggravated battery in Aurora, according to records on file in Kane County Circuit Court.\nWritten Naperville police reports indicated the 44-year-old Carlton most recently lived on the 1000 block of Fifth Avenue in Aurora. He remained Monday in DuPage County Jail in Wheaton, where he is being held on $10,000 bail, jail records showed.\nIn the the North Central College incident, he was charged with a total of 10 misdemeanor counts of battery, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass to a building and violation of bail bond. The latter charge stems from a child support case in Kendall County, according to records there.\nNaperville police Cmdr. Jason Arres confirmed Carlton was arrested just after 9:30 p.m. Thursday, after police were called to the North Central College library, in the 300 block of School Street.\nA campus security officer called police, after determining Carlton had previously been banned from the campus, Arres said Monday. He was arrested after further investigation revealed he had used his feet to caress those of four women between the ages of 18 and 22, who had taken off their shoes while studying at tables in the library.\nWillowbrook survivor says she has God and youth to help her heal Kimberly Fornek If Melissa Schuster thought about her 27th birthday several months ago, she would not have imagined that police officers, paramedics and doctors she had not yet met would be invited to the celebration.\nBut they were invited to the barbecue held Saturday in Borse Memorial Park in Willowbrook, because...\nIf Melissa Schuster thought about her 27th birthday several months ago, she would not have imagined that police officers, paramedics and doctors she had not yet met would be invited to the celebration.\nBut they were invited to the barbecue held Saturday in Borse Memorial Park in Willowbrook, because...\n(Kimberly Fornek) Carlton's \"bare foot made contact with the victims' bare feet multiple times,\" Arres said. The alleged fondlings occurred at different times and locations in the library earlier in the evening, he said.\nJim Godo, the college's assistant vice president for external affairs, on Monday confirmed the incident had occurred, and that school officials had had similar trouble with Carlton about five years ago.\nCarlton \"received a 'no trespassing' order from the college in 2010,\" Godo said. He was banned from campus after officials discovered \"there was some similar, suspicious and unusual behavior\" on his part in a prior incident, Godo said.\nAn examination of court and police records revealed an early incident involving Carlton occurred in July 1996, when he was 25. He was charged with battery after crawling under a table and fondling the toes of a woman studying in the library of Moraine Valley Community College in southwest suburban Palos Hills.\nAnother incident occurred in June 1999 in the library of the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, when Carlton \"placed his bare foot upon the bare foot\" of a woman patron, according to court documents. Carlton in January 2000 pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery, and was ordered to perform 10 days of community service work as his penalty, records indicated.\nA third incident occurred in July 2006 at the Naperville Public Library's 95th Street facility, in the 3000 block of Cedar Glade Drive on the city's southwest side.\nArres said that matter involved a woman in her early 40s, and had \"similar circumstances\" to the North Central College case, with \"bare foot to bare foot\" contact initiated by Carlton. A Will County judge in October 2006 sentenced Carlton to eight days in jail and placed him on two years of conditional discharge for that crime, court records showed.\nA fourth incident occurred in March 2008 inside Wheaton College's Buswell Memorial Library, when court records indicated Carlton \"touched (a woman's) foot with his bare foot three times.\" That happened in defiance of a written, \"no trespassing\" order issued earlier by the college.\nCarlton in April 2009 pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal trespass to land in that case, and was placed on conditional discharge.\nKane County court records showed Carlton in March 2007 was charged with criminal trespass to land at Aurora University in Aurora. He was found guilty three months later in that case and sentenced to seven days in jail, according to records.\nAurora University officials could not be reached Monday by telephone for comment on that matter.\nCarlton also has served jail time in a 1999 incident, in which he resisted DuPage County sheriff's officers; and a September 2003 case of trespassing in Wheaton, records indicated.\nwbird@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Naperville Sun Crime Aurora Naperville", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c3dc6/turbine/ct-nvs-naperville-area-library-batterer-st-1014-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619cd30/turbine/ct-dbr-willowbrook-attack-tl-1015-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:23:34.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
