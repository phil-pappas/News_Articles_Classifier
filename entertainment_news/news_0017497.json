Compared to the earlier model of updating details of voters district wise in Tamil Nadu, he said under the new system the details of voters in all the 32 districts has been “integrated”. ”Through this method, we will be able to remove errors in voters data and also remove duplicate entries. It can be done very accurately,” he said. He said the election commission website was undergoing changes and a revamped website will be launched on October 16. To a query whether the existing method of adding voters details manually through special camps would be phased out, he said, “It is not so. The new facility would be available along with the existing model.” During the recent special campaign undertaken by his office, he said 14.5 lakh voters’ applications were received. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 9:24 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:16:51.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
