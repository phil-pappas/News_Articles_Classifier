Fox owners Mike and Marian Ilitch watched from a nearby car as the relighting event was led by Ilitch Holdings chief Chris Ilitch and OIympia president Tom Wilson. \nThe event capped a months-long project that replaced nearly every piece of the 87-year-old theater's marquee, including handcrafted \"F-O-X\" lettering created by glassblowing artisans.
