Their new book, “ Risk Bandits : Rescuing Risk Management from Tokenism” (published by Balboa Press AU), provides directors and executives with insight into organizational risk management practices .\nThe authors say that every survey of directors and executives shows their dissatisfaction with risk management in their organization. Their book is written for non-risk professionals using a minimum amount of technical jargon. The authors show how risk management systems usually comprise detailed operating processes and high-level oversight; they believe their book offers the first explanation to align these two demands.\nHogarth and Pooley’s book proposes an alternative to traditional practices for grounding organizational risk management practices on a solid foundation that protects and creates value. Their book serves as a guide to directors and executives of organizations on how to deal with the information served up to them by their internal risk managers and external consultants.\n“Risk Bandits”\nBy Rob Hogarth and Tony Pooley\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 286 pages | ISBN 9781452529844\nE-Book | 286 pages | ISBN 9781452529851\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Authors\nRob Hogarth is a non-executive director with more than 40 years corporate experience in both Australian and international markets, including 29 years as a partner of KPMG focusing on business risk.
