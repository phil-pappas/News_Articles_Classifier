Directed by David Hyde Pierce. \nWith Marylouise Burke and Holland Taylor. \nSchedule: Varies. \nTickets: $90. 212-581-1212, or nycitycenter.org \nYou can figure out pretty quickly where \"Ripcord\" will end up. The trip, though, is full of surprises and lots of silly fun. \nAuthor David Lindsay-Abaire, whose recent, prize-winning plays \"Good People\" and \"The Rabbit Hole\" were naturalistic character dramas, lets himself go with this new comedy, which opened Tuesday night at the New York City Center. \nUnder the droll direction of David Hyde Pierce, it mixes farce and sentimentality, blends witty lines with loopy settings and even has a few minutes of serious drama. It's very lightweight, and hard to resist. \nThe play's set in New Jersey, at the Bristol Place Assisted Living Facility, where Abby (Holland Taylor) has been a resident for several years. \nA former schoolteacher, she wears a conservative skirt and blouse each day, as though about to set off for work, and spends her time reading on her tablet and watering her plants. \nShe also has a snappish personality, and is very unhappy to have to share her room with a newcomer, Marilyn (Marylouise Burke). \nWhere the tall and elegant Abby is sarcastic and rude, the short, jolly Marilyn is a beam of sunshine: friendly, happy and eager to be pals. \nThat these mismatched roomies will become bosom buddies by the end of the evening is a no-brainer, but their journey from here to there includes a visit to a Halloween haunted house, an onstage sky dive (the first, I believe, since the jump in \"Honeymoon in Vegas\") and extreme psychological mind-messing. \nThe pivot of the plot is a bet that Abby urges on Marilyn: If Abby can do something that makes the perpetually joyful Marilyn angry, the latter will move to a different room, available because of the recent death of another resident. (\"It's too bad she's dead, but silver linings, right?\" Abby observes.) \nHowever â€” if Marilyn can scare the stoic Abby first, she'll not only stay, but be able to swap beds with Abby, getting the one closer to the window. \nThe battle starts out small, with Abby suggesting that a drawing of a fire engine by Marilyn's beloved grandson looks like a Pap smear. Things quickly escalate, though, to a duel of elaborate, diabolical schemes, in which each woman pushes the bounds of human decency to the very edge, while dragging in members of the other's family, and inducing honest-to-goodness belly laughs. \nMuch credit goes to the veteran actresses, who play their characters to the hilt. \nTaylor (\"Ann\") delivers Abby's stinging one-liners with the timing of a stand-up comic, and then switches gears for a surprisingly touching scene that Abby has with her long-estranged son. \nBurke (Lindsay-Abaire's early plays \"Fuddy Meers\" and \"Kimberly Akimbo\") makes the irrepressible Marilyn genuinely lovable, and also has a hilarious shocker of a sight gag.
