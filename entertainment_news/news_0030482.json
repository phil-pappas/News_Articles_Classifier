Three lakefront parks that carry the names of former presidents (Lincoln, Grant and Jackson) offer variations on the same theme.\nArchitects? They design buildings but rarely get their names on them. Two exceptions line State Street: the Hotel Burnham, as in Daniel Burnham, and the Sullivan Center, for Louis Sullivan. Burnham's name also adorns a South Side lakefront park.\nNow the list of buildings and parks named for architects is about to grow: Related Midwest, the Chicago division of New York-based Related Cos., will honor the prolific, albeit little-remembered, Chicago architect Edward H. Bennett and name its 843-foot apartment and condo tower at 451 E. Grand Ave. \"One Bennett Park.\"\n\"Edward who?\" you might say.\nBennett, who died in 1954, was Burnham's co-author on the Plan of Chicago, the influential 1909 document with legacies including Navy Pier and double-deck Wacker Drive. Yet his impact hardly stopped there. He had a hand in projects ranging from the Parisian-style bridges over the Chicago River to the widening of city streets such as Roosevelt Road. And he gave shape to projects outside Chicago such as the Federal Triangle group of office buildings in Washington, D.C.\n\"Bennett's a great name,\" Curt Bailey, Related Midwest's president, said Friday. \"Not only does it have a great stature in Chicago architecture. In our opinion, it's been recognized less than it should have been.\"\nDesigned by New York architect Robert A.M. Stern (like Bennett, a traditionalist) and due to open in late 2018, the tower won't be the only landing spot for Bennett's name. An adjacent, Related-owned park will be renamed Bennett Park. Both may contain tributes to Bennett — not a bad idea to raise the profile of an architect whose name recognition is no match for Frank Lloyd Wright's.\nDispelling the suggestion that Bennett's name won't help sell units, Bailey said: \"I think that the buyers and the people who rent in this building will be people that are interested in architecture. I think they're the types of people who will recognize the Bennett name and who will be interested in learning more.\"\nbkamin@tribune.com\nTwitter @BlairKamin\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Architecture Curt R.
