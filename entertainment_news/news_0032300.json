Having performed in several other West End shows himself, including Cats, Fame and Chicago, he has a fantastic voice, with an impressive range, evidenced by tasteful song choices including Evanescence’s Bring Me To Life and Sonny and Cher’s Bang Bang. \nHerself fresh from a major fundraising gig with Sir Tim Rice, the stylish Ms Ellis treated us to a selection of showstoppers from some of her leading roles in West End shows, including Memory from Cats, having taken over the role of Grizabella from Nicole Scherzinger earlier this year, Defying Gravity from Wicked (five years as Elphaba in the West End and on Broadway) and I Know Him So Well from Chess; an early treat shared with Velma. Ending the show, they reminisced about earlier days and Velma ‘became Glinda’ to re-join Kerry for a rapturously received rendition of another Wicked song, For Good, before Velma soloed with Angel’s heartfelt No Day But Today from Rent. \nBoth artistes paid deserved compliments to the backing band, led by Alex ‘Teddy’ Clements on keyboards, put together with very little rehearsal. \nCrystal clear sound and atmospheric lighting really contributed to what was a great evening and one that everyone present will undoubtedly remember with great affection.
