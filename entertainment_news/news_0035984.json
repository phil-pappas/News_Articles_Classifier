She wore a thick grey cardigan over a blue sweater which covered her fake baby bump.\nIn another scene, Zellweger looked elegant wearing a blue lace dress and a pair of black stockings.\nUnlike the previous one, in this scene, Zellweger's Bridget Jones was not pregnant. She approached a street vendor and started a conversation with him.\n\"Bridget Jones's Baby\" marks Zellweger's third essay at reprising her role as the title character following 2001's \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and 2004's \"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:16.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
