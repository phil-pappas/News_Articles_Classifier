And no, it isn't anyone from Kollywood, but someone all the way from Hollywood â€” Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is said to be in talks to star in the film. Nothing is confirmed yet, and the makers are even now hunting for some big names from the industry to be part of the project. Earlier, there were reports that Kamal Haasan and Vikram were being considered for this role, but the makers now seem to be intent on getting an internationally popular star for this film as it is a cult hit among sci-fi film fans worldwide.\nA source says, \"Talks are on with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Shankar is planning to have him on board for the villain role. As of now, negotiations are going on, but he has not signed officially. However, nothing is final as the team has been in talks with many such biggies for the past one month for this role.\"\nWhen we contacted a spokesperson from the production house that is producing the film, they were reluctant to talk about it. \"We have not approached anyone as of now. Things are still in the initial stage and we can't comment anything about the project at the moment,\" the spokesperson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:16:12.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
