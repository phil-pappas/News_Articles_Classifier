They sing in German, they side-step those visuals typical of the rock 'n' metal world, and they present an incendiary, everything-hotter-than-everything-else live experience the like of which hasn't been seen beneath the popular music banner… Some call it ' Rammstein-esque '.\nThis 21 st Anniversary Box Set – a numbered, career-wide collection – not only features the six studio albums, produced by Jacob Hellner and re-mastered onto 180-gram heavyweight double vinyl by Svante Forsbäck, it also comes complete with a separate rarities double LP, ' Raritäten, ' including a previously unreleased version of the track 'Los.'\nIn terms of additional content for ' Raritäten, ' Rammstein have taken the thoughtful approach, and there is certainly a choice selection on offer; 16 tracks taken from previous singles, 'fan edition' releases and special album formats.\nHowever, it's the six studio albums that are the centerpiece here, a bona fide body of work bound together by attitude and intent. When it comes to defining precisely what Rammstein stands for, band and brand, it's the catalogue as a whole that speaks the loudest.\nEven the overall presentation of the Anniversary Box lives up to the band's longstanding reputation for quality and detail. The result is a tactile, high-end package that – as well as representing the band across the board, mirroring the scale and ambition of their music – successfully spotlights the character of the individual releases; each comes complete with gatefold sleeve, original artwork and lyrics. Four of the six albums have not been released on vinyl before: Herzeleid, Sehnsucht, Reise, Reise and Rosenrot .\nWith the vinyl weighing in at a full 180 grams, the sonic capacity is there to properly represent a group capable of shifting from a whisper to a roar without being slowed down by the gears in-between.\nFrom pin-drop to fusillade, from 'Stirb nicht vor mir' to 'Rammlied' , the XXI Anniversary Collection is a carefully-crafted, stylish, authentic celebration of Rammstein 1995-2012, leaving the door ajar for Studio Album Number Seven…\nWhen and if that arrives is in the hands of the 'Kollektiv' itself, but one thing's for certain: the cake honoring their 21st Anniversary won't be short on candle power…\nRammstein.lnk.to/XXI | Rammstein.de | facebook.com/Rammstein | twitter.com/RSprachrohr\nRARITÄTEN [2LP]\nSide A\nFeuerräder - Single: Engel (Fan Edition), 1997\nWilder Wein – Single: Engel (Fan Edition), 1997\nDas Modell – Single: Das Modell , 1997\nKokain – Single: Das Modell , 1997\nSide B\nStripped – Single: Stripped , 1998\nHalleluja – Single: Links 1 2 3 4, 1998\nMein Herz brennt (Piano Version) – Single: Mein Herz brennt , 2012\nLos (Full Band Version) – Album: Reise, Reise , 2004 (Full Band Version – previously unreleased)\nSide C\nFühre mich – Album: Liebe ist für alle da , Special Edition, 2009\nDonaukinder – Album: Liebe ist für alle da , Special Edition, 2009\nHalt – Album: Liebe ist für alle da , Special Edition, 2009\nRoter Sand (Orchester Version) – Album: Liebe ist für alle da , Special Edition, 2009\nSide D\nLiese - Album: Liebe ist für alle da , Special Edition, 2009\nMein Land - Single: Mein Land , 2011\nVergiss uns nicht – Single: Mein Land , 2011\nGib mir deine Augen – Single: Mein Herz brennt , 2012\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278743\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150324/184009LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rammstein-mark-the-bands-21st-anniversary-with-the-release-of-xxi----the-first-vinyl-box-set-of-their-career-including-all-six-studio-albums-plus-rarities-double-lp-300163171.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
