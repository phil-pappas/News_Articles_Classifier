He was 73 years old.\nHis agent, Brent Taylor, said the singer died at his home Tuesday in Morehead City, North Carolina.\nThe Georgia-born singer debuted on Columbia Records with \"Down in the Boondocks\" in 1965, which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. But he struggled to match his initial success with his subsequent records and starting in the late 1980s, he reinvented himself as a country singer.\nHe was known for songs like \"I'll Pin a Note on Your Pillow,\" ''Tell it Like It Is,\" and \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore.\" He was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1988.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nYhDvktiJo"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:07:16.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
