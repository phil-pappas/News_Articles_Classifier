Reports have hit from various sources including WWE’s website that Cena will in fact not appear on the upcoming European tour by the company in November. He’ll be off for possibly two months or more with this month’s Hell in a Cell pay-per-view considered one of his last appearances before he takes time off for “personal reasons.”\nIn other news and rumors, Cageside Seats reported on Oct. 2 that The Undertaker’s match against Brock Lesnar at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view will be the final time these two compete. It’s considered the “rubber match” between them after Brock Lesnar won at last year’s WrestleMania to snap Taker’s legendary undefeated streak at the event, and Undertaker’s win more recently in controversial fashion at SummerSlam. The two will compete at Hell in a Cell to ultimately decide who comes out on top.\nPaul Heyman broke the news to Channel Guide Magazine saying “I think it's very safe to say Brock Lesnar versus The Undertaker at Hell in a Cell is the final time these two will step in the ring against each other.” He added that “there is such an interest in the final confrontation” and “people want it now,” so he’s glad Vince McMahon decided to change the final match from WrestleMania 32 next year, to even sooner at the upcoming pay-per-view. Current odds have Brock Lesnar as a -420 favorite to win that match, while Undertaker is listed at +300 for an “end of broadcast ruling.”\nThe Hell in a Cell 2015 pay-per-view will take place on Oct. 25 at Los Angeles, California in the Staples Center. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker is one match on the card, as well as a match involving Roman Reigns vs. Bray Wyatt inside Hell in a Cell. It’s unknown who John Cena will face, but he’s expected to be on the card, and it’s likely that Seth Rollins will have some sort of title match defending his championship against the newly reborn “Demonic” Kane.", "external_links": ["http://ringsideresults.com/john-cena-leaving-wwe-2015-or-2016-return-date/", "http://www.cagesideseats.com/2015/10/2/9440295/paul-heyman-says-wwe-hell-in-a-cell-last-time-brock-lesnar-vs-undertaker"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:44:10.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
