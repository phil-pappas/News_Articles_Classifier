They formed the control group in a study purporting to show that monkeys exposed to various human childhood vaccines developed \"autism symptoms.\" It was a hot mess of a study , but that hasn't stopped lots and lots of folks in thrall to their confirmation bias from using it as 'evidence' that vaccines cause autism.Welp, here's another monkey study for you. Just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , this study by Gadad et al. managed to rely on a decent experimental design to examine the effects of childhood vaccines from the 1990s or from 2008 (after thimerosal was removed) on the monkeys' behaviors and specific brain areas.The Hot Mess Monkey Study authors include Laura Hewitson, who had filed a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (since withdrawn). This group compared the results for three-ish ( or two ) monkeys in the control group to 12 infant monkeys that were vaccinated. They reported that the results showed that the monkeys showed altered social behaviors compared to controls and had changes in brain structure. Compared to three (at most) controls. I've addressed the issues with that study before . As have others .The PNAS study used a total of 79 monkeys, pretty evenly distributed across control and treatment groups (16 controls, at least a dozen in all treatment groups). Some monkeys received 1990s vaccines but on \"an accelerated schedule,\" some received 1990s vaccines on a regular schedule, some got everything but MMR, some got MMR alone, and some got the 2008 vaccines on an accelerated schedule.\nHere's what the PNAS authors found: No behavioral changes were observed in the vaccinated animals, nor were there neuropathological changes in the cerebellum, hippocampus, or amygdala. This study does not support the hypothesis that thimerosal-containing vaccines and/or the MMR vaccine play a role in the etiology of autism. Indeed, the authors saw \"virtually no\" instances of a behavior that would be considered specific to autism, even in monkeys, known as stereotypy . They tracked the animals for a year (about age 3 in human years) and found nothing. Before people cry \"Pharma Shill\" on this, it's also worth noting the funders of this study: We thank the following for their generous financial support: The Ted Lindsay Foundation, SafeMinds, National Autism Association, and the Johnson and Vernick families. SafeMinds, an organization dedicated to demonstrating a mercury- or vaccine-related causation of autism, probably didn't have this outcome in mind when they funded this study. They are very invested in mercury/vaccine-autism causation. This summary of research they've funded through 2013 includes 55 references to mercury.Laura Hewitson, author on the Hot Mess Monkey Study, is also an author on this PNAS paper. She is the research director at the Johnson Center for Child and Health Development , which is a revamp of Thoughtful House , former home to Andrew Wakefield . With these parties involved, it ought to be tough for those committed to the idea that the original Hot Mess Monkey Study was gospel to find a way to ignore this one.But SafeMinds is reportedly already working hard to call the findings into question, according to Newsweek . Whereas Hewitson stands by the latest findings, SafeMinds wants the monkey data reanalyzed, a fishing expedition of sorts, except with monkeys. Perhaps they should ask Brian Hooker to do it.But right now, we have plenty of monkeys. Funding from emphatically non-pharma shill organizations. A researcher whose name bridges two opposing findings and who stands by the latter results.More evidence--so much evidence--that vaccines aren't causative in autism and don't alter outcomes at the behavior or brain cellular or protein levels. Even in our close primate relatives. It's common to talk about how hard it is to prove a negative like \"vaccines don't cause autism.\" But with 17 years of intense focus on exactly the question of an association, we've come damned close.", "external_links": ["http://www.johnson-center.org/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/07/26/laura-hewitson-has-left-the-university-of-pittsburgh/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/18/andrew-wakefield-resigned-from-thoughtfu/", "http://www.safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SafeMinds-research-publications-2000-2013-with-intro-FINAL.pdf", "http://www.johnson-center.org/site/staffDirectory", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/05/this-is-going-around-new-study-baby-monkeys-develop-autism-after-routine-cdc-vaccinations.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2014/10/06/its-official-brian-hookers-reanalysis-of-mmr-data-is-retracted/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/07/16/the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle-vaccines-cause-autism/", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/454285480/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.newsweek.com/anti-vaxxers-accidentally-fund-study-showing-theres-no-link-between-autism-and-379245", "http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/09/24/1500968112", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20628439", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598746/", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/05/whacking-monkeys-in-name-of-science.html", "https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/monkey-business-in-autism-research/"], "published": "2015-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:06:45.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
