She had loved the script of the film but wasn’t too convinced about working with director Jayant Gilatar. Eventually she came around, but she has been meddling a little too much in the making of the film. Insiders reveal that she comes to the sets even on days she is not shooting. A source says, “There are times when she is not required for a shot but she supervises it. A few days ago, when they were shooting in Whistling Woods, the DOP of the film, Baba Azmi walked out of the last shot because she was interfering too much.” When asked about this, Jayant had a different version to tell. “I wanted to take the last shot and he had to leave for some place urgently.” About Juhi, the director said, “She happened to call me as she was somewhere near the sets. I told her that I was shooting, so she asked if she could come see. I said ‘sure, please come’.” Juhi Chawla remained unavailable for comment. The film was to release on September 5, but due to date issues of various actors the, last portion is being shot now.
