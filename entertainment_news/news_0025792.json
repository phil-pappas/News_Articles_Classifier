Low camera shots of Walter White opening his boot are very similar to Vincent and Jules doing the same in Pulp Fiction.Then there's the striking resemblance between the characters of Jane Margolis (Breaking Bad) and Pulp Fiction's Mia Wallace - same haircuts, similar attitudes and even deaths. The scene where Walt encounters Jesse's hostage, Krazy-8, while he drives past him is close to the scene in Pulp Fiction where Butch rams his car into Marsellus Wallace.Again, Breaking Bad's Hank Schrader and Pulp Fiction's Vincent Vega catching up on their reading on the loo was also difficult to miss.Vince Gilligan clearly took a bit of inspiration from the cult filmmaker when making the AMC hit. It was also revealed recently that Pulp Fiction could have been very different, with Michael Madsen, Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette lined up for iconic roles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:55:47.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
