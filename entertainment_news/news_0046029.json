The Block's Kingi and Caro pictured in their winning kitchen. Channel 9 Subscribe Now \nQUEENSLANDERS Kingi and Caro secured their third room reveal win on The Block tonight. \nThe Townsville parents impressed during the competitive week of kitchen deliveries, beating penthouse renovators Dean and Shay by just half a point. \n\"It's the cherry on top to what we've been trying to achieve in the other rooms,\" Caro said. The high-tech kitchen featured a touch-screen splash back and an island bench rendered by Kingi. Kingi and Caro's winning kitchen in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \n\"I love it when the kitchen feels like the hero of the apartment,\" Neale Whitaker said. \nJudge Shaynna Blaze called it hot, sexy and sophisticated. \nDean and Shay were lucky to deliver a finished kitchen after facing unique dramas because they chose to change the location of their kitchen to take in the city views. \n\"That is wow factor; I haven't used that phrase in a long time,\" Whitaker said. Dean and Shay's kitchen in a scene from The Block.

Channel 9 \nGuest judge Romy Alwill praised their attention to detail with their handles and cupboard doors. \nBut Alwill and Blaze questioned the functionality of the sink's position and the potential danger of the extreme corner of the island bench facing what will be the dining room. \n\"You will get buyers who will be looking at this apartment for a family and go this is really dangerous,\" Blaze said. \nAndrew and Whitney were praised for designing a fresh kitchen - their strongest room so far according to Whitaker. \nBut the Melbourne couple was also plagued by functionality issues.
