Posted just a moment ago \nABC/Randy Holmes (LOS ANGELES) -- Will Vin Diesel direct the next Fast & Furious sequel? He seemed to drop a hint that he might in a recent Facebook post. \nThe Fast & Furious star and producer wrote that he and director Justin Lin, who's helmed several of the previous films in the series, have been \"very intensely discussing\" a trilogy that would wrap up the series. However, he noted, Lin has a potential conflict that would not allow him to direct Furious 8 . \n\"I will share something crazy that my mother said six months ago after the studio had me announce the date for 8 to the world…,\" Diesel continued. \"'Either you direct 8 yourself... or don’t do it.' \n\"Some of you vinbook pioneers are all too familiar with my mother’s wisdom, as I have posted her sayings in the past on Our page… but I wrote it off as just a mother’s love and belief in me, though she has seen first hand what I've done to make these movies defy expectations and become increasingly successful, even when the studio thought I was crazy... haha.\" \nAn insider tells The Hollywood Reporter that the studio behind the franchise, Universal, isn't happy with Diesel's post. Regarding the possibility that Diesel will direct Furious 8 , the source adds, “It is never going to happen.” \nFurious 8 is scheduled for release on April 14, 2017. \nThe seventh film in the series, which hit theaters earlier this year and included a tribute to its late star Paul Walker, made 1.5 billion dollars worldwide. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
