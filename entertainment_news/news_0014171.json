Downtown streets will be closed from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Seventy-five vendors will offer arts/crafts, jewelry, food and other items. Looking for Brunswick Stew? The festival will have it available along with pizza, fried Oreos, funnel cakes and Chick-Fil-A sandwiches. “Our restaurants will be open, too,” said Tiffany Lattero, owner of Reno’s Pizza and president of the Gibsonville Merchants Association. The event is rain or shine. “We’ve never had a rain date because thankfully, we’ve never been rained out,” Lattero said. A main stage located on the street behind the Depot Stage will feature entertainment by Michael Ken at 10 a.m.; Mark Addison Chandler at 11 a.m.; Divided By Four at noon and Crossoverdrive at 2 p.m. A second entertainment area will be set up near Jack’s restaurant and will include Centre Stage On Main at 11 a.m. and Karizma at 2 p.m. Bobby’s Hobbies will operate the miniature train, weather permitting. A children’s area will offer bounce houses, a photo booth and other activities; cost is $5 per child. “It’s going to be a great day to visit downtown Gibsonville,” Lattero said. “You’re bound to see somebody you haven’t seen in a while. That’s the beauty of this festival.” Admission is free, but some events require a fee.
