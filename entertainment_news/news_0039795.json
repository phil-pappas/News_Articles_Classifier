The Fun in The Sun festival has been cancelled for 2015. PICTURE: TOM LEE. Source: News Corp Australia \nORGANISERS of the popular Fun in the Sun Festival claim they have been left with no choice but to cancel this year’s event due to “unreasonable” conditions imposed by Cairns Regional Council. \nThe festival, which has been held in Fogarty Park for the past two years and last year attracted an estimated 10,000 visitors, was scheduled to take place on October 24. \nBut Einstein Events project manager Renae Walsh said the council had been “extremely unreasonable” in imposing restrictions on the event leaving them “no choice” but to cancel just weeks out from its scheduled date. \nMrs Walsh claimed an application was made to the council in November for the use of Fogarty Park for this year’s event. \nShe said she was advised a booking could not be placed until early this year and, after going through the application process, they were advised of a list of restrictions less than two weeks ago. \nShe said the conditions restricted the use of balloons and a petting zoo, and imposed strict curfews for noise. \n“They just did not want to compromise,” Mrs Walsh said. \n“They’ve made the conditions so hard we can’t run it. \n“We’re absolutely devastated.” \nMrs Walsh estimated she would be out of pocket to the tune of “tens of thousands of dollars” as a result of the event’s late cancellation. \nCouncil’s community, sport and cultural services general manager Linda Kirchner said any hiring of a public area was subject to conditions to “ensure public safety, minimal environmental impact and protection of amenity”. \nShe said while certain animals such as sheep, goats, dogs and horses were prohibited in the CBD, native animals could be allowed. \nMs Kirchner also said the balloon ban only covered helium balloons due to Cairns’ proximity to the Great Barrier Reef. \n“All conditions were in line with those imposed on similar events in recent years,” she said. “Council has attempted to work with the Fun in the Sun organisers, as it does with all venue hirers, to meet all of the requirements. \n“Unfortunately, in this case, the event organiser has chosen to cancel the event rather than to meet the conditions.” \nMrs Walsh said there had been a lack of communication and support provided by the council. \nThe Fun in the Sun Festival began in 1963 when it was organised by a volunteer committee. In the 1990s it was taken over by Cairns City Council and went through a series of name changes before morphing into the Cairns Festival that was held over August to September. \nIn 2013, Einstein Events took control of the rights to operate Fun in the Sun as an independent event. \nThe event was last year voted best major event at The Cairns Post Hit Awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:50:29.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
