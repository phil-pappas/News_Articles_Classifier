A legal brothel. \nCall it Nevada's not-so-secret vice: It is the only state with legal prostitution. It has been selling sex with the blessing of the law for years, even if legislators aren't exactly thrilled about it. FILE - In this July 31, 2009, file photo, Los Angeles Lakers' Lamar Odom speaks to the media during a news conference after the Lakers signed Odom to a multi-year NBA basketball contract, in El Segundo, Calif. Odom spent most of his 14-year NBA career in Los Angeles with the Lakers and Clippers, becoming a fan favorite before he sought even more fame with the Kardashians. Odom, who was embraced by teammates and television fans alike for his Everyman approach to fame, was found face-down and alone Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, after spending four days at the Love Ranch, a legal Nevada brothel. (AP Photo/Jeff Lewis, File) \nWhile the law of supply and demand would suggest that Nevada's one-of-a-kind brothels are doing great, the truth is they are struggling to remain relevant.
