Photo: Graham Tidy. \nHave you ever come across a tree or branch and instantly seen the shape of a lizard or bird?\nA group of Indigenous artists from Central Australia go one step further, making their visions a reality by carving sculptures out of wood.\nCanberrans will have the chance to see their handiwork when the Punuku Tjukurpa exhibition opens at the Canberra Museum and Gallery on Friday, October 9.\nPiti, by Ivy Ingkatji. Photo: Supplied \nThe exhibition, presented by Artback NT, will display 88 sculptures and artefacts collectively known as punu – carved objects made of wood.\nAdvertisement Artback NT executive officer Louise Partos highlighted the skills and talents of the artists.\n\"You might just be out driving with the artists and they will look at a tree and they'll actually see the object,\" she said.\nTea Pot. by Niningka Lewis. Photo: Supplied \n\"Whether it's a bird or a snake, they'll look at that, either the tree or the tree root and they'll know exactly what they want to carve from that piece of wood.\"\nThe works range from spear throwers and shields to carvings of desert birds and animals.\nIt is the first touring exhibition of artworks from the Maruku Arts archive based at Mutitjulu, near Uluru.\nEarly Days: Tourists stop at Mulga Park, Anangu sitting with the Punu, by Niningka Lewis. Photo: Supplied \nPartos says the show is about much more than just the physical works of art.\n\"The exhibition absolutely represents stories and people's lives and livelihoods so the show is just as much about people and about cultural maintenance,\" she said.\nPartos described Punuku Tjukurpa as an \"exhibition of national significance\".\n\"So much Australian art … is very painting based. What is incredibly important about [punu] is that it is an alternative art form,\" she said.\n\"The stories and the designs that are burnt onto the artworks are incredibly culturally significant and there are layers of knowledge about what those designs mean.\n\"When you see the objects they are absolutely beautiful. They're aesthetically pleasing, stunningly carved.\"\nPunuku Tjukurpa includes works made by three generations of artists representing the passing down of the tradition of wood carving and painting.\nPartos said punu was an ancient art form that has undergone a modern transformation.\n\"The making and the carving of wooden objects is something that's happened for tens of thousands of years,\" she said.\n\"The branding and the mark making on the actual items is more recent over the last 150 years.\"\nVisitors will have the opportunity to learn more about the culture behind the artworks in new and interactive ways.\nA mobile app developed specifically for Punuku Tjukurpa will be launched alongside the Canberra exhibition to give users \"a deeper, more engaging experience\" including the chance to learn Indigenous words and colouring for children.\nAudio descriptions of the artworks can be downloaded onto any device or can be heard on supplied MP3 players.\nThe exhibition will also include sand drawing and wood carving demonstrations from some of the artists at CMAG and the ANU School of Art on the opening weekend of October 10 and 11.\nPartos said she had many favourite pieces among the exhibition, but a few sculptures stood out.\n\"There is a creation snake and she's got these eggs in her throat and she's one of the creation ancestors for that country. I think she is an incredibly stunning and vital [piece], she's beautiful.\n\"There are a couple of the lizards that have the most wonderful legs. Really strong legs and you can just envisage these lizards walking across that country, that sand.\"\nPunuku Tjukurpa will be showing at the Canberra Museum and Gallery until Sunday, November 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:52:04.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
