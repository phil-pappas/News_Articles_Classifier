The orange and red walls are decorated with a mix of signs for various beers and Chicago sports teams. Cubs and White Sox banners hang from the ceiling.\nrelated advertisement Jaxx Pub & Grill\n338 E. Army Trail Road, Glendale Heights, (630) 539-3466, jaxxpubandgrill.com\nHours: 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday Food: Jaxx's menu is a mix of traditional bar food with some quirkier options such as all-day breakfast, in case you're craving a breakfast burrito or French toast late at night, and the Elvis Burger, which is topped with bananas and peanut butter that melts right on the meat. The Â¾-pound made-to-order burgers are among the most popular items on the menu, particularly on Mondays when they're half price. They're also served with excellent hand-cut fries. For an appetizer, try the fried ravioli, which are crispy on the outside and filled with gooey hot ricotta cheese. The garlic wings proved the only disappointment; they lacked a good flavor punch. Luckily the bar provides a caddie of hot sauces if you want to spice things up.\nLiquid consumption: The draft beer list changes regularly, incorporating plenty of seasonal brews like Schlafly Pumpkin Ale. You'll also find unusual picks available by the bottle including Coney Island Brewing Co.'s hard root beer. Daily drink specials include $4 shots on Saturdays and a Bloody Mary bar on Sundays.\nCrowd: The spot draws in plenty of couples and small groups, with ages ranging from 20s to 60s. You'll find a mix of sports fans wearing baseball hats and jerseys and smartly dressed people on dates. A free buffet during Bears games has made Jaxx a popular destination for football season.\nService: Our very outgoing server was happy to talk about the menu and check on anything she wasn't sure about, such as the current draft lineup. She also offered tastes of drafts before we committed to a purchase and spoke from personal experience about plenty of items. She checked in regularly to make sure our drinks were refilled.\nMusic: Jaxx hosts karaoke on Wednesdays, DJs on Thursdays and live music on Fridays and Saturdays. Go-go dancers perform once a month, and there's also trivia on Tuesday. A virtual jukebox provides tunes the rest of the time.\nParking: There are plenty of spots to be found in the free strip mall lot.\nOverall: With so many sports to watch now, Jaxx Pub & Grill is a great spot to catch a game and stick around to check out the beer list and the evening's entertainment.
