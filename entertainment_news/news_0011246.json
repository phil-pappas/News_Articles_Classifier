Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nLIVING in his caravan while touring the nation, country music singer Chris Callaghan thinks he's living the dream. \nHe combines his original music with a special Johnny Cash tribute show in his performances. \nCallaghan has been performing since he was 11. \nNow in his 50s, he thinks he's better than ever. \nCallaghan will perform his first Gladstone show next weekend at the QRI Music Hall. \nFor the past two years Callaghan has transformed his performance into a Johnny Cash tribute. \n\"I've got glasses normally but I use contacts when I'm in my show, if I used my glasses I'd have to do a Buddy Holly tribute,\" he laughed. \n\"It was a huge learning curve for me. \n\"One of the big things was doing a show with a seven-piece orchestra,\" he said. \n\"Even though it's been more than 40 years, I'm still good.\" \nHe said every minute and every note is rehearsed to give the audience the best experience possible. \nAs a young musician, he said Johnny Cash was a great influence. \n\"It never ceases to amaze me how fortunate I am to be able to sing these songs and have people connect with them. \n\"It's extremely rewarding.\" \nCallaghan draws on his experiences travelling through Australia for his original music. \n\"Prior to living in the central coast of NSW not long ago I was in Alice Springs for 14 years. \n\"I was singing to the tourists. \n\"It's amazing the affect this country has on you when you're driving through it. \n\"A lot of my songs are the places I've been and the people I've met. \n\"When you get to go out and see Australia, it's a very interesting place ... it's a song writer's paradise,\" he said \nCallaghan was invited to perform at the QRI Hall from one of the social club's members. \nIt'll be his first time in Gladstone. \n\"I do know that it's a mining town. \n\"I've heard that everyone's doing it a little bit tough at the moment too,\" he said. \nChris Callaghan will perform at the QRI Hall on Friday, October 23 at 8pm. \nBookings can be made on 49727227. chris callaghan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:43:16.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
