The theatre actor plays a Naxal leader who delivers powerful dialogues and has a mean demeanour in the film.\nPramod, who was in films like Jugaari, Ulidavaru Kandante and RangiTaranga, says that films were never on his mind, and happened by chance. Pramod had plans to join NSD and pursue theatre, but his family, which is into business, wasn't kicked about this. \"I've been doing theatre for nearly 15 years. When actor Avinash saw me rehearsing for a play, he was convinced that I should do a role in Jugaari. I landed Ulidavaru Kandante also by accident. As for Ricky, Rishab said that he had a strong character and didn't want a familiar face to play it. This was why he approached me,\" he explains.\nPramod adds that he had to unlearn a lot for this role. \"I have lived in urban surroundings, so playing a Naxal leader in the forest was tough. I read a lot of novels and watched a few films. I had to change my body language. He is a very rough and tough character and he treads through the forest like it's his home, without caring about the stones and plants. I found it tough initially, as I would always look down. But I decided to walk in the jungle every day before and after the shoot and got acclimatized to it,\" he recalls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:12:09.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
