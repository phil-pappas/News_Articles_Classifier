US Ambassador Samantha Power last week said Washington had concluded that a medium-range ballistic missile launched on October 10 was capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. At a meeting of the Security Council yesterday, the United States joined by the three European countries presented a report on the missile launch and said the sanctions committee should take “appropriate action.” The four countries said the committee should investigate this “serious violation” of Security Council resolution 1929, according to a letter to the council obtained by AFP.

The four countries took part along with China and Russia in successful negotiations to reach a historic deal with Iran in July that calls for lifting sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. The letter marked a first step toward possible sanctions, although such a decision would require agreement from China and Russia. Iran on Saturday denied that the missile launch was in volation of UN resolutions, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif saying that it was not designed to carry nuclear warheads. Iran insists it has no plans to develop atomic weapons. \n  5:28 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:52:15.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
