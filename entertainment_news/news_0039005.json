Johnson installed civil rights pioneer Thurgood Marshall as the high court’s first African-American justice over Southern segregationist resistance.\nSo has the underlying dispute over judicial philosophies, between the school represented by Marshall and his liberal successors and the court’s strict constructionists over whether the Constitution is a “living document” or should be read literally now.\nStill, Wil Haygood’s gripping new Showdown , which examines the context behind Marshall’s 1967 nomination and confirmation, provides valuable reminders about the civil rights revolution of the 1960s and the truly mind-boggling horrors that precipitated nation-changing events.\nIt is especially apt at a time when many Republican governors and legislators, disdaining racial motivations, are pressing legal curbs that would weaken the results of those hard-fought battles against racial voting barriers that climaxed with the 1965 enactment of the landmark Voting Rights Act.\nHaygood is a longtime journalist with the Boston Globe and The Washington Post best known for “The Butler,” a Post article that led to the prizewinning movie about the White House observations of a black butler. Haygood portrays the Marshall fight on two levels.\nOne is the actual Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process, in which Southern conservative senators sought to portray Marshall as weak on crime and insufficiently knowledgeable about constitutional history. The second is the vivid portrayal in intervening chapters of Johnson, Marshall and his senatorial prosecutors against a backdrop of the brutality that marked the lives of many Southern blacks in the century after the Civil War.\nJohnson deliberately handpicked Marshall — the nation’s pre-eminent civil rights attorney and the legal mastermind behind the case that led to the court’s 1954 school desegregation decision before brief service on the U.S. Court of Appeals and as Solicitor General — to break the court’s color line. Only the fifth nominee to testify in person before the Judiciary Committee, his seven hours of testimony pales when compared with 20 hours or more for the most recent nominees.\nTwo Southern Democrats conducted the bulk of the questioning, Sens. John McClellan of Arkansas and Sam Ervin of North Carolina, later to become famous while chairing the Senate’s 1973 Watergate hearings, abetted by Democrat turned Republican Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. They operated under free rein from the panel’s chairman, Sen. James O. Eastland of Mississippi.\nHaygood shows their motivations in biting biographical portrayals. Eastland’s starts with an especially graphic rendering of his father’s role in the lynching of a black man accused of killing his brother, after whom the future senator was named, and the resulting racist atmosphere in which he was raised.\nHe also sketches the courageous stories of some less well-known figures who, working with Marshall, fought for civil rights in the South before the struggle burst onto the nation’s front pages and television screens. Haygood includes blacks such as Evangeline Moore, whose father helped register 100,000 black Floridians before he and his wife were killed when their house was blown up. No one was ever prosecuted, and authorities took 45 years to unearth the full story. Stories of whites include J. Waties Waring, a South Carolina federal judge whose dissent in school desegregation cases foreshadowed the Supreme Court’s ruling and stirred such anger he retired and moved north.\nAnother chapter likens the contentious climate surrounding Marshall’s nomination to that which greeted President Woodrow Wilson’s 1916 choice of the court’s first Jewish justice, Louis Brandeis, just months after the lynching of Leo Frank, a young Georgia Jew accused with questionable evidence of killing a 13-year-old girl.\nHaygood also traces the relationship between Johnson and Marshall, dating back to the latter’s activities in the case that ended the all-white Texas Democratic primary and Johnson’s early inclusion of black youths while running the state branch of the National Youth Administration.\nThese two very different men are the twin heroes of the book, the white president who championed the rights of black Americans while acknowledging it would cripple his Democratic Party in the South, and the black lawyer who, the author says, “introduced white America to Negro America” and provided a powerful role model by showing other blacks the power of the law.\nCarl P.
