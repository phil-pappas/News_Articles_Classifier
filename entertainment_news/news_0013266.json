He said they don't understand why he has to go to his office and talk and they sometimes see him crying. \n\"I hope no one takes it out on them,\" he said. \"You can yell at me, you can scream at me, you can berate me, and I will sit there and take it,\" he said. \nRannazzisi lost a contract to do commercials for Buffalo Wild Wings in the wake of the revelation. He said the cast of \"The League\" cancelled an appearance at New York's Comic Con because they didn't want the story to be a distraction. \nHe described the story as a lie he told once and did not know how to extricate himself from it. The New York Times exposed his lie in a story.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:13:08.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
