Kicking off the year by supporting The Kooks throughout Germany, the band headed back to home shores with shows booked in nationwide. A long run of regional dates took the band into the summer where they have been performing at a string of festivals including Live At Leeds, Dot to Dot, and Barn on the Farm. \nAnd it has been their live set that has been reeling in admirers. The reaction that Junk Food Forever has been inducing amongst the crowds made it an obvious choice for the band’s first single campaign. The love for the track has been reflected at radio as well, with Annie Mac and Huw Stephens promoting the track at Radio 1, as well as being featured as one of XFM’s Songs of the Week.
