Also, you get mouthwatering sweets at Bengali Market. The variety of cuisines available in Delhi is remarkable,\" he says. He even has a question about the city . \"Someone told me that Delhi is polluted and you don't get to see the sun shining in its full glory. Is that true?\" he asks. On his association with theatre, Arif said, \"I have done lead roles in off-beat films and supporting roles in mainstream ones. When it comes to theatre, I have done it in phases. I have chosen to do it only when I found the character being offered very exciting.\" About the Delhi audience, he said, \"It was wonderful performing here. I am happy that they patiently watched our play and later, many of them came to congratulate us for a successful show.\"\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Theatre news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:31:57.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
