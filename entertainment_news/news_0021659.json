Perspective is a wonderful thing and is a significant reason behind the study of history and the existence of museums. Knowing what the past gave to the present and how people of the past dealt with problems is critical to making informed decisions about the future. As the Walla Walla region grows and changes, knowing where we came from provides us with the perspective to choose well regarding our own tomorrows. The Living History Company represents a wide selection of the soldiers, pioneers and Indian people who built a community in the area we call home. From the days of the fur trade into the mid-20th century, the Company includes Hudson’s’ Bay Company factors and traders, politicians and sheriffs, preachers and teachers, firemen and nurserymen, farmers and ranchers, progressive women and a bordello madame. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the performers and enjoy the heritage of the region. This is the final performance of the season for the Living History Company for the year 2015. It will be presented in the pioneer settlement at Fort Walla Walla Museum. Visitors are encouraged to question the Living History re-enactors about their lives and times. Museum hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. through October, and 10 a.m.-4 p.m., November-February. Admission is free to members and children under 6; $3 for children ages 6-12; $7 for seniors 62 and older and students; and $8 general admission.
