He was driving along Route 9 in Galloway Township when he captured an image of a creature he believes could be the Jersey Devil himself. Black shared that photo and his story with NJ Advance Media last week. \nDays later, another New Jersey resident shared a video showing the same winged-figure flying across the tree line at dusk. Reader Dave Black of Little Egg Harbor captured this photo in Galloway Township. He believes it could be the Jersey Devil. What do you think? (Photo provided by Dave Black) MORE : Is the Jersey Devil in Galloway Township? \nWas it real? Or just a really elaborate Halloween prank that seemed to strike a nerve with the hundreds of thousands of readers who shared and talked about the sighting and the legend of the flying, hooved creature. \nI decided to head down to the Pine Barrens in Galloway Township near Leed's Point, the fabled home of the Jersey Devil, to see what I could find. Accompanied by Jersey Unique Minds Paranormal Society (JUMPS) Founder Doug Hogate Jr., we set out on a road trip to the Pine Barrens Thursday. \nIt was a beautiful day. The sun was shining brightly and the air was crisp with a fall chill. \nWhile many say you have to hunt for creatures such as the Jersey Devil after nightfall, we have discovered that the paranormal — spirits or monsters — can be around us anytime, both day and night. \nWe stopped at several spots along Route 9 in Galloway near the golf course where Black claims to have seen the beast. \nWith a camcorder and audio recorder, we entered the forest in search of any clues we could find that would lead us to the discovery of the Jersey Devil. \nThe trees were thick, the canopy nearly solid above our heads. The deeper we stalked into the woods, the darker it seemed to get. \nWe investigated and explored for nearly two hours and didn't see anything that even resembled a Jersey Devil — or any contraptions that would mimic what Black claimed he saw — and didn't find any signs suggesting that he was nearby. \nHowever, at one point, I heard something rustling through the leaves and underbrush near where we were huddled among the pines. The sound didn't resemble the soft hopping sounds of a bird, and sounded like it was moving around on two legs. \nI called out to whatever may have been out there, but it never showed itself. \nWas the Jersey Devil watching us from afar? \nMaybe. \nOr perhaps (more likely), it was a squirrel or a rabbit enjoying the lovely autumn day. \nHave you ever ventured out in search of the Jersey Devil? Or had an experience similar to Black's? Let us know in the comments. \nKelly Roncace is senior investigator and team leader with Jersey Unique Minds Paranormal Society, a professional paranormal investigation team based in Salem County.
