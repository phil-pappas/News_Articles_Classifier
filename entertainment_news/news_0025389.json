It still takes effort. The struggle to command oneself is among the most difficult for most humans, but the result -- control over one's destiny to the extent that this is ever possible -- is well worthwhile.\nARIES (March 21-April 19). Sometimes you're the star; sometimes you're the extra. Today will bring another scene that requires respectful normalcy and blending in. After the director yells \"Cut!\" you can go back to being yourself.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20). There's nothing shocking about today's events except that you know how most of them will turn up and turn out before they happen. Are you getting more psychic, or is your life getting too predictably routine?\nGEMINI (May 21-June 21). Many Gemini people are after success in business today. It's a matter of finding out where your customers are and going after them there. It's not so hard. In fact, it's a lot easier than trying to make them come to you!\nCANCER (June 22-July 22). The best action is the one that has you feeling so powerful, engaged and interested along the way that it doesn't matter to you what the result of all this effort will be.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Truth: This endeavor you've taken on is not for the faint of heart. False starts, mistakes, long periods of recovery, more mistakes -- so what? The only way to truly fail at this is not to try at all.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). It's becoming evident that you don't have an excellent plan. It seemed like a good idea, but if the efforts aren't paying off as expected, it's time to change your tactics.\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Everyone has to start somewhere. Remind yourself of this as you look at those who have what you'd like to have. It may seem very far away at this point, but if you keep going, your day will come.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). The best idea isn't always the one that gets implicated. Who has authority? Who's popular? It's that person's idea that is more likely to get traction. Think about this before you propose your idea.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). The passersby appreciate what you add to the ambiance of a place, though most won't say it. So it's nice when a certain someone likes the song of your gypsy spirit and puts spare change in your tambourine.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Some talk in words strung together. You've heard enough of that. Today someone talks to you in meanings and feelings that move you to do something different from what you would have before the conversation.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Just because another person has cast you in a certain role in his or her life doesn't mean you have to take that appointment. You're A-list. You can pick and choose your projects.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). You'll save yourself money and trouble by thinking forward as to what's coming up between now and the end of the year. There are certain events coming up that you will not be able to attend unless you make plans now-ish.\nTODAY'S BIRTHDAY (Oct. 20). Your amazing power to overcome adversity has gotten you where you are, and this year you'll use those skills to build a life very different from the one you knew. Wealth, status, advantage -- you're not driven to possess them, and yet they'll freely be given because of the value you are able to offer others. Virgo and Sagittarius people adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 4, 22, 38, 1 and 18.\nASTROLOGICAL INSIGHT: WHAT THEY LIKE ABOUT YOU: C'mon, admit it: As confident as you may be in your own skin, you still wonder what people think about you sometimes. And if they like you, you want to know why, partly out of curiosity and partly so that you can re-create the magic when you meet new folks. You're attractive for so many different reasons, and here are a few you might not have thought about before. ARIES: They love that you know your mind and you go for it. TAURUS: You do what it takes to be successful, and you nurture success in others. GEMINI: You always know the right thing to say. CANCER: You make people feel comfortable enough to be their true selves. LEO: You're glamorous, and they feel more glamorous being around you. VIRGO: You get things done, and you're cool about how you do it. LIBRA: You have impeccable style. SCORPIO: You're sexy. SAGITTARIUS: You're worldly and sophisticated. CAPRICORN: You're powerful, and you empower others. AQUARIUS: They admire you for the difference you make in the world. PISCES: You are soulful, and your actions speak directly to people's hearts.\nCELEBRITY PROFILES: Among other things, \"The Office\" star John Krasinski is now a producer, husband and father. Krasinski was born when the sun and the moon were in Libra, the sign of talented diplomats, partners and team players with a knack for creating brilliant collaborations. Look for Krasinski in \"The Hollars,\" a family comedy in which he stars with Anna Kendrick.\nTo write to Holiday Mathis, visit www.creators.com and click \"Write the Author\" on her page.
