The city’s rich history provides endless attractions for both visitors and locals. But history lovers aren’t the only ones coming to Philadelphia, and while there are plenty of non-historical sites around, those of us less inclined to studying our country’s past shouldn’t skip over some of the prime historic locations.\nNaomi Figueroa View all 6 photos Naomi Figueroa Three reasons you should visit the National Constitution Center on your next visit to Philadelphia:\n1. This is not the history museum you’re picturing from your 6th-grade school field trip. It’s colorful and interactive with plenty of multimedia. You don’t have to read everything but can go at your own pace and explore whatever interests you most.\n2. Even if you don’t learn anything from all the exhibits (though doubtful), the Freedom Rising theatrical production will remind you of important parts of the nation’s history, and it might even stir up some patriotic pride. It might sound less than intriguing, but don’t miss this part of the center.\n3. The feature exhibitions are always changing and cover unique and relevant topics from a historical perspective. Some of the current feature exhibitions are:\nReligious Liberty and the Founding of America—In light of the Pope’s recent visit to Philadelphia, as well as the Dalai Lama receiving the Liberty Medal, this exhibit explores how religious freedom became a right guaranteed to all U.S. citizens. On display until January 3, 2016 Constituting Liberty: From the Declaration to the Bill of Rights—View some of the founding documents up close! On display until December 2017 Speaking Out for Equality: the Constitution, Gay Rights, and the Supreme Court—Learn about the gay rights movement and the debate around the interpretation of the Constitution. What’s Cooking, Uncle Sam?—Explore the government’s effect on the evolving American diet. On display until January 3, 2016 While you might not be inclined to visit every historical site in Philadelphia, don’t overlook them all. In the City of Brotherly Love, you might just uncover a dormant love for history.", "external_links": ["http://constitutioncenter.org/experience/exhibitions/main-exhibition/freedom-rising", "http://constitutioncenter.org/experience/exhibitions/feature-exhibitions/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:03:47.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
