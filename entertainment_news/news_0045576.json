She told the magazine: \n“I was diagnosed with Lupus, and I’ve been through chemotherapy. That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke. I wanted so badly to say, ‘You guys have no idea. I’m in chemotherapy. You’re assholes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.” \nBeing splashed across the tabloids has been frustrated, she said: \n\"I'm so (expletive) nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me. I’ve been working since I was 7. I’ve been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17. It’s so disappointing that I’ve become a tabloid story.\" \nGomez told USA TODAY earlier this month that despite the hate, her fans keep her motivated: \n\"Not to sound cheesy. Literally, I feel like this industry has the ability to make you really hate people. Just the people I have come into contact with in the press and stuff like that, it's really disappointing to see what society and fame has become. But my heart hasn't changed. I care about people. I would love to go to dinner with everybody and just hang out and talk, and I love my fans. My fans are the only thing that's been consistent in my life.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1LjQHDN More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:27:53.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
