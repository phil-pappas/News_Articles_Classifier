Hence, both of them didn't invite their parents. It explained why her mother Nicole Kidman, who was in London at the time the wedding took place, didn't attend the wedding either. Though Nicole wasn't invited, she was \"overjoyed\" at her daughter's new union. Regarding the couple's decision to limit their guest list, the \"Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation\" actor was reportedly cool with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:09:39.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
