Leading it all will be this year's grand marshal, Daniel Altilio, president and CPO of the United Way of Hudson County.\n\"He's a wonderful guy but he is so involved in so many committees and boards and has received dozens of awards in the Hudson County area,\" said Nicholas Grillo, the parade committee's president. \"One of his big missions with the United Way is putting and end to homelessness. We were blown away by his credentials.\"\nWhile Monday is recognized as an official state holiday, Saturday's event in Jersey City is less about the controversial Italian-born explorer and more about celebrating Italian-American culture and heritage on a local level, Grillo said.\n\"We've toyed with changing it to the Italian American Heritage Parade,\" Grillo said. \"We are walking a fine line with it, but it truly is about Italian-American heritage and not him discovering America.\"\nThe procession will head out from Dickinson High School at 1 p.m. and make its way down Newark Avenue, before turning south onto Jersey Avenue and then east onto Christopher Columbus Drive. The parade will then turn south onto Grove Street before wrapping up at City Hall.\nMarchers, civic groups, marching bands, cheerleaders and community organization are still being invited to participate in the parade. Anyone interested should call Grillo at 201-783-3045.\nAn Italian flag raising ceremony was held at City Hall and the Hudson County Court House on Monday.\nIn a city that was recently named the second best in the nation for racial and ethnic diversity , Grillo said parades play a vital role in maintaining Jersey City's cultural vitality.\n\"All of these cultural groups contribute to what makes Jersey City so great,\" Grillo added. \"It's something fun to do for an hour. Go out and get some brunch or lunch, and hang out.\n\"You don't have to be Italian to celebrate with us.\"\nIn addition to Altilio, this year's parade honorees are:\nItalian Man: William Santomauro\nItalian Woman: Carmel Galasso\nItalian Educator: Danielle Savino-Garzon, Ed.D (JCPS)\nItalian Police Officer: Carmine Disbrow (JCPD)\nItalian Fire Fighter: Jason Greco (JCFD)\nItalian Medical Professional: Dr. Melissa Manzo\nItalian Businessmen: DeMarco Brothers\nItalian Businesswoman: Kathy Mercado\nHonorary Italian Man: Daniel Rivera\nHonorary Italian Woman: Stacey Flanagan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:55:45.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
