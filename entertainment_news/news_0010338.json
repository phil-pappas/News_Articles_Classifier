(Photo: (Photo: Peter Kramer, AP)) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNBC weather wonk Al Roker apologized Monday for covering the historic flooding in South Carolina by tweeting a selfie with his crew, all grinning beside a disabled car trapped in a washed-out road. \nThe tweeted picture, now deleted, showed Roker and his two-person camera crew, clad in rain gear, smiling widely as they prepared to \"report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina\" for NBC's Nightly News . \nBehind them, a small green-yellow car lay on its side in a shallow hole left by the collapse of the side of a road. \nRoker later said the woman who was driving that car got out safely. But the explanation came too late; outraged tweets soon appeared: @alroker @NBCNightlyNews Al, your photo is extremely poor taste. We are devastated and you're smiling. Shame on you pic.twitter.com/katHhTKvxo — Chuck Crumpler (@czaned) October 5, 2015 This selfie disgusts me. SC is not smiling over all they have lost @TODAYshow @alroker #SCStrong #PrayForColumbia pic.twitter.com/brFfd2LONR — Jessie Johnson (@jessiegour) October 5, 2015 \nRoker realized his mistake immediately, deleted the tweet and issuing apologetic new tweets. Absolutely correct. I apologize for being insensitive. The woman in that car got out without injury. We Should not have been in the picture — Al Roker (@alroker) October 5, 2015 We came down to report and I offended those who lost so much. I am sorry — Al Roker (@alroker) October 5, 2015 \nWhat does this mean? Maybe nothing. \nVeteran broadcasters like Roker know better than to smile on camera while reporting tragedies, such as a mass shooting for instance. But maybe they forget the rules, and good manners, when goofing off with silly selfies on social media.
