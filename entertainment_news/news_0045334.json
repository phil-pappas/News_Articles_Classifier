Related Links PHOTOS: South Carolina Flooding By The Associated Press COLUMBIA, S.C. — Relentless rains and floodwaters brought much of South Carolina to a standstill. Thousands warily watched rising creeks, others had to be rescued after water spilled into their homes. Still others helped save neighbors. The following are vignettes from people in the storm:\n‘It just floated away’\nWilson McElveen lives on a hill in a place called Forest Acres, but just down the hill, neighbors were flooded out of their townhomes by water surging over a nearby dam.\nHe said the rushing waters burst through the doors of one home, and emergency responders had to use an ax to break down the door of another townhome to rescue a woman.\n“We’ve seen people lose everything,” said his wife, Sharon McElveen, noting they lost only a small boat. “It just floated away. But I could care less about that stupid boat.”\nThey have taken in friends who need a place to stay.\n‘Counting ourselves very lucky’\nBrenda Van De Grift said her husband got trapped in his car while driving to work Sunday morning at the Van De Grift Animal Clinic. She said he was driving an SUV and thought he could make it, but didn’t realize how deep the water had gotten.\n“He was running late,” she said. He doesn’t even know who pulled him out.\nOthers said high ground kept them safe.\n“We’re counting ourselves very lucky that we’re uphill enough,” said Griffin Schultz, a resident of an apartment complex near one flooded area.\n‘She lost everything’\nVladimir Gorrin said he led his 57-year-old aunt through floodwaters surrounding her apartment near Gills Creek — one of the hardest-hit areas in Columbia.\nGorrin said his aunt, Wanda Laboy, waited several hours after calling 911, but authorities did not come. So family came to help.\n“She’s very distressed right now,” said Gorrin, 38. “She lost everything.”\nMore than 18 inches of rain, nearly all of it in 24 hours, fell in the area. It was so bad that hundreds of businesses, homes and apartments flooded.\nGorrin’s aunt is heading with him to his house, where it has not flooded, but the drive home was tricky.\n“I’m trying to find my way back home, and every road that we’ve taken is blocked or flooded,” he said in a phone interview inside the car with his aunt.\n‘God will take care of us’\nIn Florence, about 80 miles east of Columbia, Mary Gainey said she was told Sunday afternoon that she’d have to evacuate her home because of rising floodwaters from a nearby creek.\n“I’ve been rushing around, making sure I have everything I need,” said the 65-year-old Gainey.\nShe’s going to stay at her daughter’s house until the water recedes.\n“This is the first time we’ve had to be evacuated,” she said. “It’s strange leaving everything behind.”\nShe said she’s worried, but thankful that she had some warning.\n“I know God will take care of us,” she said.\n‘You have no idea how bad it really is’\nRawlings LaMotte, 38, a residential real estate broker, said an area in front of his gated subdivision in eastern Columbia was filled with up with 5 feet of water.\n“It looks like a raging river,” LaMotte said. “I’ve lived in Columbia my entire life, and we always laughed about the 100-year flood plain, but I guess this is what it is.”\nEarlier Sunday, LaMotte said he and a friend got into a small motorboat and ended up ferrying several people to safety, including a man who had been out of town and found roads to his home blocked.\n“I told one of my friends earlier today, this put everything we’ve seen with Katrina into perspective,” LaMotte said. “Until you’ve experienced something like this, you have no idea how bad it really is.”\n‘Community will soon be back to normal’\nCharleston, South Carolina, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said he’d never seen flooding and rain as in the past few days, not even in his city after Hurricane Hugo years back. And he’s been mayor for 40 years.\n“The good news is that the torrential rain is over,” Riley told The Associated Press after his historic city near the coast escaped the worst of the flooding that pummeled the state capital, Columbia.\nNow he said he expects city offices in Charleston would be back open Monday morning: “You know the amount of rainfall that we have experienced is unprecedented. I feel very fortunate that we were able to get through this as well as we have.”\nHe’s now hoping his city, at least, can quickly put the ordeal behind.\n“I think the community will soon be back to normal. One of these days, perhaps not today and perhaps not tomorrow, we’ll have a nice sunny day.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/43e74e8f984fe32c830f6a706700beb7.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/43e74e8f984fe32c830f6a706700beb7.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:09:45.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
