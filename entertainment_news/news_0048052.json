Performers Casson and Friends will then create four brand new short dance pieces in locations across Aberdeen using as many of the letters as possible. All you have to do is download a print-at-home letter at www.choreospondance.com, fill it in and post it off – then keep your eyes peeled for the locations announced on the festival website.\nIan Abbott, Director of Citymoves Dance Agency, said: “It’s an honour to be launching DanceLive’s 10th anniversary programme, my first DanceLive as Director of Citymoves.\n\"Since it began in 2006 the festival has grown and taken root in the heart of Aberdeen.

The awards celebrate the most creative and innovative partnerships between the cultural and business sectors, and AKJB has been selected for its work in creating musician exchanges between the two cities and further afield. A joint venture between Don Sharples, of Jazz at the Blue Lamp, and Jan Purchla, of Geokrak in Krakow, AKJB has organised tours of Poland by jazz groups Euan Burton Quartet, Alan Benzie Trio and Fat-Suit and Glasgow Indie band Pronto Mama. In return, Polish jazz, blues and experimental bands have played in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness, and Glasgow. The Benzie and Burton groups have since received return invitations to Poland and Fat-Suit’s tour extended into Ukraine and Hungary, all as a result of the initiative.\naandbscotland.org.uk", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-08T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:43:06.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
