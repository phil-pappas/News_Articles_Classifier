At a special screening for the film Wednesday, star Michael J. Fox admitted on the red carpet that he was a little torn over that one. \"It's tough because I'm a New Yorker and I would love to see the Mets do well. But I'd love to see the film be right. So I'm torn,\" Fox said before the game ended, adding, \"Whatever happens, happens.\" Christopher Lloyd, who played Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, said he didn't really follow the predictions, except for that one. \"I'm hoping the Cubs win tonight and go into the series, that would be the ultimate prediction,\" Lloyd said with a bit of trepidation. But that was not to be. The New York Mets defeated the Cubs 8-3 Wednesday in the National League Championship Series. They will advance to the World Series.\n\"Back to the Future Part II\" envisioned more than baseball. It depicted a colorful 2015 with flying cars, hoverboards and self-tying shoelaces. While those doodads are hardly prevalent today, the film did accurately tease the rise of flat-screen televisions, biometric scanning and hands-free gaming. Even President Barack Obama was impressed. Earlier in the day, he sent Fox a tweet that read: Happy Back to the Future Day,\nAccording to writer and co-creator Bob Gale, most of the predictions, including the one about the Cubs, \"were intended to be jokes.\" \"The most far-fetched prediction was that lawyers would be abolished in the future. We didn't expect that would happen, but you put stuff in the movie you're going to enjoy,\" joked Gale. Fox and Lloyd arrived onstage at \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" which is filming at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House this week, in a DeLorean dressed as Marty McFly and Doc Brown. The talk-show host informed the pair about all the advancements that have been made since 1985, including cronuts, emojis and selfies. \"Doc, it seems like 2015 kinda sucks,\" joked Fox as McFly. He later came back out sporting a pair of sneakers that appeared to have power laces, as depicted in \"Back to the Future Part II.\" \"Back to the Future\" Day was celebrated around the world Wednesday. It marked the day in 1985 that McFly, along with Doc Brown and Jennifer Parker traveled in their souped-up DeLorean time machine to 2015 in the sci-fi film trilogy's second installment in 1989. \"Back to the Future\" filmmaker Robert Zemeckis' trilogy has left a lasting impression on pop culture in the 30 years since the original film debuted, spawning a theme park attraction, video game and animated series. The town of Reston, Virginia, ceremoniously changed its name to Hill Valley, McFly's fictional hometown. Washington, D.C.'s Washington West Film Festival featured a marathon screening of the trilogy and will have a Sunday screening of the original film. Stars Christopher Lloyd and Claudia Wells, as well as screenwriter-producer Bob Gale, will attend. Other celebrations in California included the \"We're Going Back\" fan event at the Hill Valley town square set on the Universal Studios lot and the Million McFly March, a gathering of fans dressed as McFly that began at the Burbank, California, location of the Burger King restaurant depicted in \"Back to the Future.\" For those who don't want to leave home, the trilogy is being streamed on Amazon Prime throughout October. Universal also is releasing a special edition trilogy box set in light-up packaging resembling Doc Brown's flux capacitor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:47:32.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
