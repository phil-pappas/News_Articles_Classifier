(March 20 - April 19): You will experience two breakthroughs this week. The first is something you've been waiting on for months and the second will be totally unexpected.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): Someone in line for a promotion gives up his spot thereby clearing the way for you. Go for it! It's unlikely that you'll ever get this chance again.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): After weeks of playing around with an idea you're ready to commit to it. But don't hold back. You want what you want so you should put your all into it.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): A friend's resolve falters, so it's up to you to remain firm. Tell this person that s/he needs to see things through to the end.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): You will soon achieve a personal milestone. This allows you to make the switch from striving to arriving.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): Stay focused on your side of the fence today. People can take care of their own affairs. Besides, you don't need the extra hassle.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): There's nothing wrong with adopting the iron hand in the velvet glove approach. Insinuation gets you a lot further than bare-knuckled facts today.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): People are jealous of your success, but that shouldn't detract from the fact that you're in a position to be generous. Find something positive to say about them today.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): You're the last holdout, but do you even know what you're holding out for? Make your best case now because supporters are growing restive.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): This is not the time to lower your sights. The only way to achieve a higher standard is to hold yourself to it.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): It's time to launch your boldest plan. This rocks the status quo and signals to naysayers that you mean business.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): If only you could begin again. You know exactly what you would do differently. That said, it's not too late to put this realization to good use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:23:23.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
