In an interview with Award Campaign, the director teased some new characters that would appear in the movie. Scott previously confirmed that Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace would be back as the humanoid robot David and Dr. Elizabeth Shaw respectively. In the recent interview, Scott hinted that David and Elizabeth would not be alone in their adventure to track down the mysterious Engineers, because they would be joined by a new group of travelers. \"It's going to be it's own separate thing because they are going to the planet of the Engineers and they are going to see what happened there. It was a disaster,\" Scott teased. \"And they will be in that alien craft that takes them there, but with a new group that's incoming, a new group of travelers in the beginning of the first act.\" There is no word yet on who the members of that new group of travelers are. Some speculated that they could be a crew of space marines that would rescue the original \"Prometheus\" crew. Additionally, Scott addressed the reported follow-up to \"Paradise Lost\". He said that the third installment of \"Prometheus\" movie series would also happen. \"There is an evolution to this one so if we can get something down I don't not see how we go [forward without a third],\" Scott said confidently. There is no official release date just yet, but \"Paradise Lost\" is expected to arrive in the U.S. in 2107. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Alien: Paradise Lost News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:57.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
