The singer, 46, debuted her emotional single “Used to love you” during her concert here on Saturday, reports people.com. “I just want to share a song that I wrote recently,” Stefani told fans before singing the powerful number. “This song is really special.” As Stefani belted out her personal lyrics, including “I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you” and “I guess nobody taught you how to love,” an intimate clip of her played in the background. Stefani and Rossdale – parents to Kingston, 9, Zuma, 7, and Apollo, 19 months – announced their divorce in August after 20 years together and nearly 13 years of marriage.
