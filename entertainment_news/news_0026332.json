The dedication ceremony will be held 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at the new building on 320 Plus Park Boulevard, according to a news release. \nThe similarly-sized Rocketship Nashville Northeast Elementary, opened last year on Dickerson Pike, also cost about $7 million. Andre Agassi embraces investor-led approach to schools \nBoth buildings were financed by the Turner-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund, a for-profit business that buys the property, builds the building and then rents to a charter school operator. Eventually, the charter rents to own the school property. \nThe Turner-Agassi business takes a market-driven approach to helping build schools and has bankrolled numerous charter school buildings across the country. For-profit charters are prohibited in Tennessee, but by paying the capital costs upfront, Agassi and Turner are able to make a profit by managing the land. The two call the model \"profit for a cause.\" \nCritics of the model have worried that the business is trying to profit off Nashville's children. Rocketship Nashville avoids criticism of peers after first year \nAgassi told The Tennessean last year his group helps charter operators build to the size and the scale of need. Operators wouldn't partner with his group if they were just landlords, he added. \nThe California-based Rocketship Education charter operator has taken an aggressive approach to expanding its national network. Rocketship officials have an eye to open more Nashville schools and are petitioning the state to reverse a decision by Metro Schools not to allow the operator to open a new school. Rocketship charter schools criticized as overly rigid \nThe Dickerson Pike school saw high growth from year-to-year among its students, but lagged in achievement measures in its first year. Rocketship officials point to the growth as reason for optimism, but Metro Schools has opted to employ a wait-and-see approach. \nRocketship uses a similar teaching model nationwide and the Nashville locations operate much like their sister schools. The schools use a learning model that blends traditional instruction with the heavy use of technology to monitor student progress. \nReach Jason Gonzales at 615-259-8047 and on Twitter @ByJasonGonzales.
