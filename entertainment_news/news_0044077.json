The others are a reprise of “Forever Afternoon” on Sunday (Oct. 11) — appropriately enough, at the White Center Field House; an orchestral piece with another Hugo-inspired title, “Those Who Remain,” featuring guitarist Bill Frisell, part of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra’s Sonic Evolution series on Oct. 29; and a full evening of the pianist’s music Nov. 12 at the Royal Room, in Columbia City.\nConcert preview ‘Some Places Are Forever Afternoon: 11 Places for Richard Hugo’ By Wayne Horvitz, 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 10, at Poncho Concert Hall, Cornish College of the Arts, 710 E. Roy St., Seattle; $14-$28 (206-547-6763 or earshot.org ).\n6 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 11, White Center Fieldhouse, 1321 S.W. 102nd St., Seattle; free (206-547-6763 or earshot.org ).\nAs always with Horvitz, “Forever Afternoon” treads to the left of conventional expectations, with the music standing in oblique relation to the poems. These are not song settings, nor are they even direct musical analogues of Hugo’s words. To the contrary, Horvitz took his inspiration from an evocative line in each poem — which he used as titles — then let his imagination run free.\nMost Read Stories Amid drought, Rattlesnake Lake reveals its roots Probe of 777 engine’s explosive failure pinpoints its origin Lloyd McClendon’s status is at the top of the new Mariners GM’s list Seattle-area teen loved football, says grieving father SEC adds millions to developer’s alleged fraud in Seattle Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “The fact that I took lines was kind of the key to it,” said Horvitz by phone, standing in a Missoula, Mont., parking lot last Friday, the day of the piece’s world premiere there. “In many ways the pieces are more about the titles than the whole poem itself.”\nHugo loved jazz. Horvitz found the improvisatory quality in his writing attractive — “just letting one line lead to another,” as he put it. Indeed, in poems like “Three Stops to Ten Sleep,” “Death of the Kapowsin Tavern” and “Degrees of Gray in Philipsburg” — which sports Hugo’s best line ever, “The car that brought you here still runs” — Hugo often begins thoughts midline, a rhythmic device Horvitz echoes in his sometimes staggered writing.\n“There’s a kind of layering,” he said. “One thing starts before something else hasn’t quite ended.”\nOn “Last Place There,” a section that has no poetic counterpart, soloists improvise in four-four time over a background figure of jagged, odd-numbered measures in three. On “All Weather is Yours No Matter How Vulgar,” from the poem “Fairfield,” Horvitz slides into honky-tonk, boogie-woogie piano.\nTo prepare, Horvitz took a research trip with his daughter, poet and photographer Nica Horvitz, through the Montana country that provided the backdrop for much of Hugo’s late-career writing. \nTheir journey included Hugo’s fishing cabin but also the deserted ex-boomtowns and depressing bars where he often drank to excess. Nica Horvitz’s photos appear in a booklet with a new CD of the piece and also on the project blog, at foreverafternoonblog.wordpress.com . \nBoth Horvitzes nicely capture the play of darkness and light, optimism and depression, that course through Hugo’s work.\n“That wasn’t such a leap for me,” Horvitz said, laughing. “I’m sort of that way, anyway. I’m extremely nervous and also basically an optimist.”\nTo create that contrast, Horvitz combined members from two of his groups, the jazz band Sweeter Than the Day, and chamber-music outfit Gravitas.\nThe colors and feelings he pulls from Ron Miles’ trumpet, Sara Schoenbeck’s bassoon, Peggy Lee’s cello and Tim Young’s electric guitar — with Keith Lowe (bass) and Eric Eagle (drums) holding down the rhythm fort — are alternately warm, floating, swinging, nervous, dark, joyous, pained, ecstatic, sad, prayerful — in short, true to the range of Hugo’s palette.\nAt the performance, each poem will be read after its correspondent music by poet McCue or Horvitz’s wife, singer-songwriter Robin Holcomb.\nThe last performance on this tour is in White Center, where Hugo began, and the premiere was in Montana, where he died. \n“It wasn’t planned that way,” said Horvitz.\nSomehow that’s in keeping with the improvising and contrary spirit of both the poet and the composer.\nNote: National Public Radio’s “Jazz Night in America” will be filming the Cornish performance.\nPaul de Barros: 206-464-3247; pdebarros@seattletimes.com ; or follow him on Twitter @pdebarros", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:41:38.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
