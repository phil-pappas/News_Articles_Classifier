He started his career in 1977 by joining Chameleon, a nascent rock band. Later in 1987 he founded a band comprising of himself and musicians John Tesh and Charlie Adams.\nSince then Yanni has produced an array of albums, with music that he classifies as contemporary instrumental.\nHis early albums include Optimystique (1984), Keys to Imagination (1986), Out of Silence (1987) as well as Dare to Dream (1992) and In My Time (1993), both of which were nominated for Grammy Awards.\nYanni Live at the Acropolis (1994) was the musician's first live album and one of his seminal works. It sold more than seven million copies worldwide.\nHis later albums include Tribute (1997), If I Could Tell You (2000), Ethnicity (2003), Yanni Voices (2009), Truth of Touch (2011), and most recently Inspirato (2014).\nAhram Online spoke to the iconic Yanni ahead of his Cairo concerts.\nAhram Online (AO): Why did you choose the Giza Pyramids as the concerts’ venue?\nYanni (Y): For me, these concerts are a dream-come-true, particularly because they’re taking place in Egypt which is home to a great civilisation, and which has always awed me with its culture and history. Growing up in Greece, where I live, I’ve come to develop a profound acquaintance with Egyptian and Pharaonic history, and my visit will be a great opportunity to become familiar with Egyptian culture.\nThis is the pleasure that accompanies a music career, in that it allows me to constantly travel, introduces me to different cultures, and enables me to communicate with others and develop friendships.\nAO: What about your decision to film the concerts and make a promotional video about Egypt?\nY: As I mentioned before, performing in the Pyramids is a great once in a lifetime opportunity, and I’ve been waiting for it for many years. So I wanted to document the realisation of this personal dream. I also wanted to reveal the beauty of Egyptian civilisation to the world, and to also show how Egyptians have welcomed me.\nAO: Your orchestra always witnesses revamps, particularly when it comes to the constant introduction of new musicians. Why so?\nY: We have a huge orchestra, which comprises some of the world’s most adept musicians. Since I founded this orchestra, I’ve always strived to find the most skilled musicians on both the professional and personal levels, which is a lengthy process. The orchestra comprises members from 11 nationalities, who were chosen after a number of entry tests.\nAs for the constant revamps, I always meet musicians during my visits to different countries, and make it a point to remember the skilled ones to eventually incorporate them in the orchestra at the right time. It is necessary for the musicians to be able to interact and mingle with the orchestra’s members.\nAO: The audience feels an inexplicable harmony in your music. Where do you get your inspiration?\nY: I feel so strongly about music, as if it discourses with me, and bares its secrets. At times, when I listen to a musical composition—regardless of what it is or who its composer is - I imagine what the composer must have felt when composing this piece, and the emotion that pushed him to compose it in the first place.\nAO: You succeeded at creating an international audience that appreciates lyric-free music. How did you achieve that?\nY: Because I know how to reach the audience, and also how to create compositions that can touch them. Because [music] is a very authentic language, it comprises a logic and directly speaks to the soul. In addition to this, most of my compositions are based on real-life events I’ve encountered, and emotions I've experienced.\nFor more arts and culture news and updates, follow Ahram Online Arts and Culture on Twitter at @AhramOnlineArts and on Facebook at Ahram Online: Arts & Culture", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AhramOnlineArts", "https://www.facebook.com/ahramonlinearts"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:40:26.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
