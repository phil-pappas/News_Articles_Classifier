Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September.\nCurator Alex Czetwertynski explains, “The festival's title, “Day For Night,” provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content. And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.”\nWith acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.\n“We always knew we wanted to produce a large scale winter event but we don’t want to put on just another festival. This one has to be different,” says festival producer Omar Afra. “What we aim for here is the wonder, the jaw-dropping allure, the accoutrements that make a festival fun: socially relevant risk-taking art, and the surprises that catch participants off guard to let the magic in.”\n[Houston, Texas, Sept 15, 2015] Free Press Houston and New York-based creative agency Work-Order (work-order.co), are proud to introduce DAY FOR NIGHT, a two day art and music festival. DAY FOR NIGHT will feature world class musicians as well as leaders in various disciplines of digital art. The festival environment will be specifically designed around the merging of technology and sound and how audiences experience them. Curating the visual component of this event is Alex Czetwertynski, a digital artist and creative director working in the fields of creative technology, interactive and experiential design. Born in Belgium, he graduated with a Masters in Philosophy from the Sorbonne University in Paris, and now lives in New York City.\n“The entire campus will be an active experience with visual and experiential art installations,” says Kiffer Keegan, creative partner of Work-Order and Houston native. The New York-based creative agency is applying their brand of graphic and screen design to every aspect of the event.\nImmersive lighting, projection, and video art will be displayed in two controlled environments with stages serving as indoor performance halls featuring live musical performances. A third outdoor stage will showcase continuous artistic content including music, original video installations, projections, and lighting. At DAY FOR NIGHT, artists will be encouraged to fulfill their complete headlining acts without the limitations of standard, stripped-down festival logistics.\nThe strategic partnership between Free Press Houston and Work-Order is the perfect combination of creative vision and festival production.\nABOUT FREE PRESS HOUSTON\nFor 13 years, Free Press Houston has been independently publishing its arts, music, and political newspaper.
