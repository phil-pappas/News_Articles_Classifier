On Oct. 15, the public is invited to the opening of the museum’s new exhibition featuring photography by Steven Gnam. \nGnam’s exhibition, “Crown of the Continent: The Wildest Rockies,” features 40 photographs of the Rocky Mountains, including the wildlands, wildlife and people of the North American West. His book of the same title has been nominated for several awards. \nTo celebrate the opening, the museum features family-friendly tours at 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and encourages guests to create a project inspired by their visit. \nComprised of photographs and maps illustrating the Crown of the Continent's ecosystem, Gnam’s photography explores connections between culture, history, communities and the outdoors. This exhibition is a continuation of the museum’s Wildlife Art Initiative, an effort to share wildlife and nature scenes as depicted in the artwork of the American West. \nAlways carrying his camera, Gnam runs, hikes, swims, climbs and skis through the landscape in order to find his photographs. His work has been featured by everyone from National Geographic books to Oprah. \nDouglas Chadwick and trained grizzly bear, Tank, snarl for the camera.

His research has taken him all over the world, and he has consulted on wildlife films, videos and exhibits for various museums. A regular contributor to National Geographic magazine, Chadwick also has written 11 books, including one book for children. \nThe Crown of the Continent exhibition’s sponsor is the James M. and Frances M. Wylder Foundation. \nNo registration is required for any of these activities. Museum admission is $9 for adults, $7 for seniors and veterans, $4 for students and free for children younger than 5 and active military members and their families with valid I.D. \nFor more information on the opening and a full list of events and activities associated with it, visit the C.M.
