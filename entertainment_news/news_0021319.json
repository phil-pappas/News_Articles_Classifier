Julie Noce reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nComedian Eddie Murphy was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on Sunday at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. Murphy, who's known for his roles in films like \"Beverly Hills Cop\", \"Trading Places\", and \"Coming to America\" joked that even his less popular projects contributed to his success. (SOUNDBITE) (English) COMEDIAN, EDDIE MURPHY, SAYING: \"You know, it's all one body of work, and I really don't look at one part of it and say -- or one thing in particular -- because everything, everything all together led to this moment -- even the movies that didn't work. Even Pluto Nash had a hand in this.\" Amongst those invited to participate in the ceremony were Chris Rock and Tracy Morgan. (SOUNDBITE) (English) COMEDIAN, CHRIS ROCK, SAYING: \"To say Eddie Murphy is a great black comedian, that's like saying Michael Jordan is a great black basketball player, you know? Eddie Murphy is to comedians what Nicki Minaj is to Spanx.\" (SOUNDBITE) (English) COMEDIAN, TRACY MORGAN, SAYING: \"It's a good song. Thank you, it's an honor to be here at the Kennedy Center to pay tribute to my comedic hero, Eddie Murphy. I think it's obvious why the producers wanted me on the show. They know I love Eddie Murphy, and they know I have a huge following on PBS.\" Former recipients of the Mark Twain Prize, which was created in 1998, include: Richard Pryor, Whoopi Goldberg, Tina Fey and Will Ferrell. The tribute ceremony will be broadcast on PBS on November 23.
