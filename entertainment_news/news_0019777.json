That travesty begat the city’s first landmarks law, signed 50 years ago. It was by no means a panacea, but it did initiate an ongoing process, one that has boasted both great victories and defeats.\nIt appears that Dallas, after years of watching its own history disappear, may have finally had its Penn Station moment. It came on a football Sunday last September, when developer Tim Headington started demolishing a series of century-old downtown buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThat outrage prompted Mayor Mike Rawlings to form the Downtown Historic Preservation Task Force, and it has reinvigorated Preservation Dallas, the advocacy organization, which released a “most endangered” list last week for the first time in five years.\nAt the same time, the City Council, acting on the\nrecommendation of the mayor’s task force, has just passed a new demolition delay ordinance, which puts a 10-day moratorium on razings to allow for review by the city’s Landmark Commission, which can halt the proceedings if a property is determined to be of historic value.\nIt is by no means a perfect, or even adequate, ordinance. It does not even begin to address the large number of significant buildings that are outside the downtown core — a vast majority of the city’s buildings. A review of Preservation Dallas’ most endangered list illustrates just how meager a protection this legislation offers. The overwhelming majority, from the Salvation Army Headquarters on Harry Hines Boulevard to the “Googie”-style Brink’s Coffee Shop on Gaston Avenue, are left unprotected by the new law, to say nothing of the historic school buildings listed in the Park Cities, which are beyond its purview.\nThe ordinance stands as progress nevertheless, and has been accompanied in recent days by a pair of real-world preservation victories. The first is the landmarking of the Lakewood Theater, which had appeared threatened, and the second the passage, by the City Council, of legislation approving an adaptive reuse plan for the long-dormant Braniff Operations and Maintenance Base at Love Field.\nThose gains continue to be offset by significant losses. Last month, a 7,000-square-foot modern gem by the late Dallas architect Enslie “Bud” Oglesby was demolished on posh Strait Lane in North Dallas, cleared so new owners could build a larger property.\nIt, too, would have been unprotected by the new legislation. Which is to say, the battle for preservation in Dallas continues, and no one should be led into a false sense of security by the new ordinance, however encouraging. If there is anything to be learned from history, it is that the battle for preservation can never be won; it is a fight that will proceed on in perpetuity, demanding public vigilance and passionate engagement.\nMark Lamster is a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:35:54.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
