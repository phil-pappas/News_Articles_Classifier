He actually coined the name because he wanted to distinguish his name from soul,” he said. \nThe Music Lecturer at the University of Ghana explained that, Fela “had a love hate relationship with James Brown so he decided he’s got to distance his music from James Brown because it’s not James Brown’s music” even though they had some similarities. \nExplaining how the name was coined, the music Prof said Fela happened to be listening to James Brown in a Ghanaian club but got annoyed and said \"no I’m going to call my music something different’.” \nAfrobeat is popular among musicians in Ghana and Nigerian musicians. The genre is a combination of traditional Ghana music, jazz, highlife, funk, and chanted vocals, fused with percussion and vocal styles. \nApart from Fela, who died on August 2, 1997, some of the well-known veteran Afrobeat musicians included Geraldo Pino, Femi Kuti, Tony Allen, Cymande, Osibisa, Yinka Davies, Manu Dibango, Dele Sosimi and Kola Ogunkoya. \nThe new generation of Afrobeat musicians include Sarkodie, Fuse ODG, Wizkid, Davido, R2Bees, Timaya among others. \n\nFollow me on Twitter: @delaXdela and Instagram: citizendela", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:01:52.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
