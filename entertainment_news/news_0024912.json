(Jason DeCrow / AP) Which Oscar-winning actress could have been the star of \"Showgirls\"? \nCharlize Theron almost starred in director Paul Verhoven's 1995 critically panned film \"Showgirls.\" \nVerhoven revealed in an interview with the New York Daily News that the Oscar winner nearly landed Elizabeth Berkley's role of Nomi Malone. \n\"Charlize also auditioned, and I don't recall her having any problem with the nudity at all,\" Verhoven told the New York Daily News about the film famous for its full-frontal nudity. \"She was good and wanted the part, but basically she was not well known enough at the time and just did not fit the part, so we said 'no.'\" \nBerkley, hot off of the 1990s sitcom \"Saved by the Bell,\" ended up playing the struggling showgirl at the Stardust Hotel. \n\"I have full respect for Charlize, but if she had been offered the part then she would probably have been chewed up in the same way they treated Elizabeth [Berkley],\" Verhoven added. \nThe director seemed happy that Theron dodged the bullet that did irreparable damage to Berkeley's career. \n\"She was very lucky that she did not get the part,\" he said. \"I wish Charlize congratulations for that because it would have been a miserable 20 years for her!\" \nVerhoven also apologized in the interview to Berkley, saying that he should have been blamed for her controversial performance. \n\"Hollywood turned their backs on her,\" Verhoven said. \"If somebody has to be blamed, it should be me because I thought that it was interesting to portray someone like that.\" \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:28:07.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
