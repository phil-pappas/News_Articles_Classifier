I don't even have a backpack.\"\n8 photos: Politicians and their SNL alter egos 8 photos: Politicians and their SNL alter egos Actress recently Kate McKinnon caught the notice of the political and entertainment worlds with her parody of Hillary Clinton, portraying her as a calculating and power-hungry politician.

Bush. Hide Caption 8 of 8 David's version of Sanders brings to mind some of the other great political impersonations \"SNL\" has blessed us with over the years. Here are just a few:\nTina Fey as Sarah Palin\nFey so embodied the spirit of the former Alaska governor who aspired to be vice president that there are videos on the web matching her version of Sarah Palin up with the real one. It's pretty uncanny.\nRead More Dana Carvey as George H.W. Bush\nCarvey is so funny as George H. W. Bush that long after he was a cast member on \"SNL\" (he left the show in 1993), he's still asked to revive his impersonation from time to time.\nPhil Hartman as Bill Clinton\nThe late Hartman was the master of voices and his portrayal of the 42nd president of the United States was a fan favorite during his eight seasons on \"SNL\" The actor left the late night show in 1994 and continued his voice work on \"The Simpsons.\" Hartman was shot and killed in 1998 by his wife, Brynn Omdahl, who then committed suicide.\nChevy Chase as Gerald Ford\nWhile the actor looked and sounded nothing like President Gerald Ford, Chase had the falling down mannerism dead to rights. He first started appearing in skits during \"SNL's\" first year on the air, 1975. Fans loved all of the bumbling.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150414160806-saturday-night-live-politics-gallery-8-large-169.jpg",
