We apologize and look forward to seeing you when we re-open.” \nScreenshot of the Facebook post from Cann Da Licious \nThe status update from the company prompted a number of replies, including one from the Corporation of Hamilton [CoH] which responded saying: “Hi all, we appreciate your concern for Cann Da Licious and want to share with you how it all works. \n“The America’s Cup Event Authority has leased all of Front Street, including Albouy’s Point where Cann Da Licious operates from, for the Louis Vuitton America’s Cup World Series this week. \n“The ACBDA made a public call for all local vendors and concession stands to apply for space inside the Americas Cup Village – any business was eligible to apply. The selection process was not done by the City but we are happy that so many Bermudian businesses have been selected to participate.” \nCann Da Licious then responded on the same thread, saying, “Thank you for all of the support. Many of your concerns were raised by us. We were extended an olive branch by CoH for reparations. All of your comments have been encouraging to say the least. Bermuda we must continue to support our fellow Bermudians in whatever sector. Change must start with us.” \nWhen asked by Bernews for comment, the City of Hamilton said, “The City of Hamilton sympathises with Vernal Cann, owner of Cann Da Licious and has been direct communication with him. Initially, Mr. Cann was asked to move from Albuoy’s Point for the three days of the Louis Vuitton America’s Cup World Series event. \n“He understood this was a condition of his lease. However, it became necessary to close off Albuoy’s Point earlier, thus asking him to move for the week rather than three days. As of today, the City has secured Cann-da-licious a temporary vendor location in Wesley Square Park. \n“This temporary lease is valid until Wednesday October 21, 2015 or upon the availability of his original location in Albuoy’s Point. We will be sure to share this information on our social media and other channels to help ensure the public is aware of his temporary location change.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:58:33.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
