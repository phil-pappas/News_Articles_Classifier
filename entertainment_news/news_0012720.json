It's adapted from \"I Heard You Paint Houses,\" a 2004 book that said Frank (The Irishman) Sheeran was responsible for killing Hoffa after the Teamsters icon disappeared in metro Detroit in 1975.\nDe Niro told a n Empire magazine podcast that he and Scorsese still plan on reuniting for the project and they're thinking of using digital technology to reverse-age the actor and other members of the cast for certain scenes.\n\"We're experimenting with how I can look, you know, like Benjamin Button's (technology),\" said De Niro.\nHe also said filming is set to begin on \"The Irishman,\" a working title, next year.\nThe movie will be based on \"I Heard You Paint Houses,\" a biography of Sheeran that offers an account of him helping lure Hoffa to a house in Detroit and then shooting him twice in the head.\nA 2004 Detroit Free Press story on the Hoffa case described the book's version of events this way: \"In the book, Sheeran said he was ordered to kill Hoffa by upstate Pennsylvania crime boss Russell Bufalino, who was Sheeran's friend and mentor. Although Bufalino liked Hoffa, the book says he told Sheeran to kill Hoffa because mob interests in Detroit, Chicago and New York were tired of Hoffa's threats about ending the mob's control of the union and suspected he might have been cooperating with the FBI.\"\nThe movie project was among the topics discussed by De Niro last month on \"The Tonight Show.\" When host Jimmy Fallon asked if it was still happening, De Niro confirmed it is still on and also will star Al Pacino and Joe Pesci and, perhaps, Harvey Keitel.\n\"I'm already standing in line,\" said Fallon.\nWatch the Oscar winner discuss \"The Irishman\" on \"The Tonight Show\" here .\nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.", "external_links": ["https://soundcloud.com/empiremagazine/180-anne-hathaway-and-robert-de-niro-october-2", "http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/robert-de-niro-confirms-his-martin-scorseseproject/2906502"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:58:56.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
