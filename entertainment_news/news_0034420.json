Worse, some said they have been unable to purchase food or important items for their families. \nThe problems with the RushCard started October 12, when a software upgrade in the transaction processing system caused many RushCard accounts to show a zero balance or caused customers to have no access to their funds. The company says the glitch has been mostly resolved, though thousands remain affected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:32:17.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
