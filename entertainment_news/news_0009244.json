The publication reported that the couple was eager to tie the knot as soon as possible. The publication quoted a so-called \"source\" as saying that \"[Joe is] eager to make it official.\" The source noted that the pair were \"very in love\" and that they \"plan to run off to the Caribbean to tie the knot,\" before adding, \"nothing will stop them.\" Responding to the report, a rep for the former member of Jonas Brothers told Gossip Cop that it's \"not true.\" Though both Gigi and Joe are currently happy together, they have no plans to elope or even get married at this stage. The elopement report aside, the pair recently attended \" Saturday Night Live \" when Joe's ex-girlfriend Demi Lovato performed. They were also joined by Joe's brother Nick Jonas who entered the venue wearing a black hat, a khaki jacket, black pants and white sneakers. Joe and Gigi, meanwhile, rocked matching black-and-white outfits. Gigi told her followers on Twitter that it was her first Saturday night with Joe. The runway beauty posted on the social media a picture of her \"SNL\" ticket. She captioned it, \"My first SN(actually)L,\" alongside emojis of two praise hands.
