Even when there will be no more than six of us for the holiday dinner, I'll make four pies. There can never be too much pie.\nI've got sour cherry, peach and berry pie fillings canned and in jars: Summer fruits are such a treat in November. Thanksgiving morning, I roll out and fill pie crusts (with dough frozen weeks earlier and defrosted overnight in the refrigerator). Before the second pot of coffee is brewing, pies are on the counter cooling.\nrelated advertisement Making ahead and freezing\nFor the fancy Pecangipane • The filling (pecangipane) can be well wrapped in several layers of plastic wrap and frozen for up to several weeks in advance. Defrost it completely before assembling the tart. The sweet-crust dough needs to be refrigerated for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. The dough, once it's shaped into the tart pan, needs to be refrigerated for 1 hour. The assembled, unbaked tart needs to be frozen for at least 8 hours and up to 1 month. It's best to eat the tart the same day it was baked.\n• To freeze, seal it in several layers of plastic wrap, because the nuts readily absorb other flavors. Select pears free of bruises and of similar size that are either perfectly ripe or slightly underripe. You'll need a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.\nFor the Zesty Apple Pie Autumn is the perfect time to put a pie or two in the freezer, while a wide variety of apples are in the market and the holidays are just around the corner. You'll need a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate.\n• The filling needs to macerate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. The assembled, unbaked pie can be frozen for up to 1 month. The baked pie can be kept at room temperature for up to 3 days.\n• Choose five or six types of apples: Some will break down to make a saucy base for the others, which will hold their shape in slim half-moon slices. Pile the apples high above the rim of the pie plate.\n-- Cathy Barrow For avid DIYers, the holiday season is our Super Bowl. We gaze at jars of apricot jam and garlic dill pickles, knowing that Uncle Jim and Cousin Jane's gifts are covered. We deftly assemble chutney and a wedge of homemade feta for that spur-of-the-moment get-together with neighbors. We chill the cherry bounce.\nDIYers invite 30 for Thanksgiving and never break a sweat. There are a few secrets to success; some of them are in the pantry and in the freezer.\nDefrost the breakfast sausage and crumble it into the stuffing. There are green beans in the freezer. Don't forget the mushroom confit.\nAnd this month, in an effort that might be more in the spirit of make-ahead than of DIY, you can freeze desserts in preparation for holiday meals. Do the work now and reap the benefits later.\nSo what if there's no pie filling already in your pantry? Take advantage of the apple varieties abundant now, at the height of the season, to make and freeze an entire pie. For fruit pies, baking directly from the freezer can help keep an unbaked bottom crust from getting soggy.\nDried fruit makes a heady, rich filling, especially when it's a mix. Combine your stashes of figs and dates, prunes, apricots and Craisins. Just about any fruit benefits from a bath in brandy, be it for a day, a week or a month; cinnamon and strips of orange zest will make that filling even tastier. Let the boozy fruit -- reminiscent of mincemeat, without all the work -- sit on the counter until it's time to make a pie; or make and freeze small tarts to have on hand for afternoon tea when the snow flies.\nI'm not above wanting to make a showstopper dessert. Inspired by thoughts of the almond pastry filling called frangipani and a preference for pecans, my \"pecangipane\" is kissed with honey and bourbon. Sliced pear halves snuggle into it and are showered with cranberries and crystallized ginger. It's pretty, it's fancy and it is perfect for a special meal.\nFreeze now, bake later. October's the month to get a holiday jump-start on the Thanksgiving beyond. One benefit of having dessert covered: You'll have so much more time to debate brining, roasting, smoking or grilling that turkey.\n• Cathy Barrow is the author of \"Mrs. Wheelbarrow's Practical Pantry: Recipes and Techniques for Year-Round Preserving\" (W.W.
