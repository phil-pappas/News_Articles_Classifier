I adore it,” said Michael. “I know everything, I’m big into the fan theories and stuff. I’ve not quite read the books, I’m too dyslexic. But maybe one day.” That’s a lot of awards! (Ian West/PA) \nHe also said a big “thank-you” to a fan who sent him some Game Of Thrones playing cards in the post. “I love them, so thank-you,” he enthused. \nHowever, the winner of the Best Actor and Best Bad Boy gongs at the Inside Soap Awards added that he gets sent some “creepy” fan mail too. \n“I get some creepy stuff – people just send me a photo, like a bit of a selfie saying ‘Do you want to come over?’ and it’s like ‘No, thank-you – I’m quite alright!’. But yeah, it’s all very flattering.” \nMany fans signed a petition calling for him to be reinstated in Emmerdale when viewers saw him seemingly killed off during the soap’s “Disaster Week” in August. Reckon he’d fit in with this lot? (Eric Jamison/Invision) \nBut the storyline was a ruse and Ross had not died after all. Michael said he had found the reaction to his character being killed off “incredible”, and added: “I think the audience are happy I’m back and I’m happy I’m back.” \nThe 29-year-old also spoke about the current storyline between Ross and his would-be killer brother Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan). \nMichael said the volatile situation between the pair, who fell out over Ross’s affair with Pete’s fiancee Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb), cannot get much worse.

You’ll have to wait and see.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:00:39.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
