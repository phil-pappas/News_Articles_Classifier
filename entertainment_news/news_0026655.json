The fifth annual Derbytante Ball will take place Saturday, Oct. 24, starting 8 p.m. at Trackside Station, 4 Union St. \nThe grand gala fetes a season that included hosting the inaugural Rock Coast Rollers Coastal Chaos Tournament and competing at East Coast Derby Extravaganza (ECDX) in Philadelphia. As always, the event also introduces this season’s Fresh Meat as newly minted veteran skaters. \nWith this year’s Derbytante set for right around Halloween, costumes are even more encouraged. Whether decked out in one’s most outlandish prom dress or as Cruella DeVille, attendees are guaranteed to have the best time. Dancing is required, aided and abetted by DJ McLovin. Photo booth fun will be provided. \nTickets are $5 and can be purchased at the door. There will be raffle, as well as a dessert auction, with delicious treats provided by Rock Coast Rollers skaters. \nFounded in 2011, Rock Coast Rollers is a diverse group of women dedicated to advancing and advocating for the sport of roller derby, women, our league and our community. The 501(c)3 nonprofit business is committed to forming bonds within the community, becoming role models for young women and activating lasting friendships through the sport of roller derby.
