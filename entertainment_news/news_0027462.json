Tonight we welcome people rich in the spirit of giving a helping hand, ... neighbors helping neighbors, men and women passionate about making Colorado a premier place for everyone.\"\nKate Paul, president of Delta Dental of Colorado, and her husband, Mike Passmore. Faye Washington, secretary of the VOA-Colorado board, and her husband, Dr. Reginald Washington, chief medical officer at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, chaired the event held at the National Western Events Center, and in keeping with the \"Colorado Iron Horse\" theme, Reginald Washington and his son, Quinn, who served on the benefit's young professionals committee, came dressed as train conductors.\nHighlights of the evening included presentation of the Noel and Tammy Cunningham Humanitarian Award to Anne and Ralph Klomp, the owners of Trice Jewelers, and entertainment by country music star Sara Evans.\nEvans demonstrated her Western grit by honoring the engagement despite having sustained a painful injury to her ACL after falling on the steps of her tour bus just days before coming to Denver.\nThis year's Western Fantasy is expected to raise $1 million for VOA's programs that provide food, shelter and companionship to Coloradans in need.\nMore online: Joanne Davidson has more about Western Fantasy in the Mile High Style blog.\nGail and George Johnson.
