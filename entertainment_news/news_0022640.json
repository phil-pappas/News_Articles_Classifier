An exhibition of Scottish masterpieces goes on show at the Art Gallery of NSW from Saturday 24 October. Photo: Janie Barrett \nIt was called a \"stupendous stash\" in San Francisco. It was the \"summer's get\" when it hit Texas. Now the same exhibition of Scotland's most precious masterpieces opens in Sydney on Saturday but on an even grander scale with rarely seen drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael.\nThe Greats, Masterpieces from the National Galleries of Scotland at the Art Gallery of NSW includes 41 paintings and 33 drawings. These range from Botticelli to Titian, Vermeer, Constable, Gauguin, Monet, Seurat, Watteau, El Greco and an enormous Frederic Church.\nTake a thesaurus if you're planning to reach beyond \"wow\", \"lovely\" and \"amazing\" because the succession of one great after another is likely to exhaust most people's supply of superlatives.\nVelazquez' An Old Woman Cooking Eggs (1618) evokes a sense of mystery. Photo: Supplied \nNot Michael Clarke, though. The director of Scottish National Gallery talks about each work with the enthusiasm of a man who could be seeing each for the first time, even after nearly 30 years in the job.\nAdvertisement \"It is like seeing pictures anew, every time someone does a show.\" The shade of red used on the walls in Sydney makes an early painting, Christ in the house of Martha and Mary , by Johannes Vermeer appear more \"striking\".\nAn Englishman who now calls Scotland home, he stops to admire the painting known colloquially as the skating minister. It is his adopted country's equivalent of the Mona Lisa . By the famous Scottish portrait artist, Sir Henry Raeburn, the whimsical painting of the Reverend Robert Walker (1755-1808), Skating on Duddingston Loch, draws crowds wherever it glides.\nJohn Singer Sargent's Lady Agnew of Lochnaw , 1892. Photo: Jenni Carter, Art Galley of NSW \n\"He is frozen in time and it feels very silent, \" said Mr Clarke.\nBack in Edinburgh, visitors arriving at the gallery ask staff, \"Where is he?\"\nAs an art student in the 1970s, Mr Clarke would travel by train from London to admire the painting.\nCommonly known as the Skating Minister , this portrait of the Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch (c1795) by Henry Raeburn is regarded as Scotland's equivalent of the Mona Lisa. Photo: Supplied \nIn the AGNSW, it is paired next to the other Scottish crowd pleaser, the lush painting that curators say launched American John Singer Sargent as a portrait artist in Britain at the same time as introducing Lady Agnew of Locknaw into society. It is understood that the young Lady Agnew arrived and slumped in an unladylike fashion into a chair, which Singer captured in a naturalistic fashion.\n\"She is a beauty,\" said Clarke, \"And the eyes, they sort of follow you around. She is quite seductive. Well, in the picture she is. I don't know whether she was in real life.\"\nTalking as the last touches are added to the show, which was three years in the making, Mr Clarke dodges masking tape on the floor and laser beams being directed at walls to get paintings and labels perfectly straight. Like a construction site, little trucks sound warning beeps as they trundle around the newly created red octagonal room.\nThe Virgin Adoring the Sleeping Christ Child (c1485) has only recently been recognised as a work by Renaissance master Botticelli. Photo: Supplied \nIt is a reconstruction - down to the red fabric walls by a Scottish fabric manufacturer on the Isle of Bute - of the gallery where many of these works hang at home in Edinburgh.\nMr Clarke won't put a value on the works in the new exhibition. To get a sense of the value of this enormous exhibition, the Botticelli, The Virgin Adoring the Sleeping Christ Child , was bought nearly five years ago for about Â£ 10.2 million after a public lottery saved it from export. \nTo get to Australia, each work was packaged in its own crate. Like the royals, the works often travel separately to ensure that an entire collection is not wiped out in an accident.\nWith Mr Clarke as a guide, every work has a story. The Botticelli, was hanging in the hallway of a grand Scottish property - attracting little thought or attention - until the mid 1990s when an X-ray revealed it was real. A portrait by the Dutch artist Frans Hals of a puritanical preacher once showed him holding a glass of wine. But when it was cleaned, the original revealed the priest was not holding a glass of wine but an ass' jawbone.\nDuring the exhibition, a series of talks will examine individual works and discuss issues such as do the old masters still matter and why the great national collections remain popular.\nThe Greats opens on Saturday at the Art Gallery of NSW as part of the Sydney International Art Series. Michael Clarke will give a free lecture at 2pm Saturday. \nHighlights include: 1. Sandro Botticelli, Italy, c1485, The Virgin adoring the sleeping Christ child . Often called the The Wemyss Madonna, after its previous owners, it was thought to have been painted by someone else. An X-ray by an art detective discovered a rose hidden from view for 500 years, and confirmed it was by Botticelli.\n2. Henry Raeburn, c1795, The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch , is often called the Skating Minister. It is regarded as Scotland's equivalent of the Mona Lisa. Is he wearing skating boots? It is hard to tell.\n3. Titian (T iziano Vecellio) , c1520, Venus Rising from the Sea ('Venus Anadyomene'). Venus fills the canvas and looks enormous compared with the tiny half shell in the corner.\n4. Claude Monet, c1891, Poplars on the Epte, was painted by Monet from a floating studio. The trees were about to be felled but Monet bought the trees so he could continue painting them.\n5. Paul Cezanne, c1902-1904, The Big Trees, is a late work by the artist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:58.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
