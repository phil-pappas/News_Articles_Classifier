Barely scratching the surface! — Scotty Redman (@Redtazziedevil) October 19, 2015 #4Corners I just realised that Lawler just proved he is very ill. He absolutely deserves sick leave if he thinks he is rational. @PMOnAir — Tracey Pearce (@TraceyAPearce) October 19, 2015 \nIn between strange conspiracy theories, dramatic video diary tapes, frequent references to “my beloved” and one truly weird demonstration on how to secretly record a phone call, Mr Lawler admitted using some of his nine months on taxpayer-funded sick leave (on his full $430,000 Fair Work Commission salary) to help Ms Jackson mount her unsuccessful legal defence in the Federal Court. \nHe also admitted he may have inadvertently been the beneficiary of HSU money, including flights and accommodation, claimed by Ms Jackson as part of the union’s civil case against her. \n“(But) I have not knowingly benefited from the proceeds of crime,” he insisted, saying some of the expenses were paid by himself. \n“I love that girl,” Mr Lawler purred adoringly as his “sweetheart” Ms Jackson handed him a cup of coffee at one point in the program. In another, Ms Jackson mops his brow with a Chux wipe. \nAs home videos rolled of the couple enjoying lavish trips around the world — more than 30 holidays worth $175,000 and paid for by the HSU — Mr Lawler and Ms Jackson spoke of a complicated political conspiracy they called “The Machine” which they blamed for trying to bring them down. \nThe question many viewers werer asking themselves was: why on earth had they agreed to go on the program? Kathy Jackson and Michael Lawler. Source: News Corp Australia \n“I feel that my duty is to speak rather than to remain silent,” Mr Lawler said at one point. \n“I would rather have no involvement in any of this. I’ve been sucked into the political world on account of being Kathy Jackson’s partner.” \nMr Lawler, who is now the subject of a government inquiry into the alleged misue of his sick leave, said he had also been secretly taping phone calls with his Fair Work Commission boss, a practice generally considered illegal, according to the program. Both Mr Lawler and Ms Jackson have been treated for depression, and it was revealed Ms Jackson was on day release from a voluntary mental health treatment centre to take part in the ABC program. \n“There is no colour in her life,” Mr Lawler said of the toll on his partner, as cameras recorded their lush NSW south coast property and home complete with designer furniture. \nThe couple has been hounded since 2012, when Ms Jackson exposed one of Australia’s biggest political scandals, bringing down her former HSU colleague-turned Labor MP Craig Thomson, who was found to have used union money to pay for prostitutes. \nThe former power couple spoke for the first time about their astonishing reversal of fortunes, slamming the allegations against them as “bullshit”. \n“I just can’t believe that it just ended up like this,” Ms Jackson said. \nMr Lawler revealed for the first time that Ms Jackson dobbed in Mr Thomson and their disgraced Heath Services Union colleague Michael Williamson at his urging. \nHis conduct is now being investigated by the Federal Government and could cost him his job.

She made headlines in 2012 after exposing the misuse of member funds despite threats to her life. At one point, she says she woke to find a spade on her doorstep , a veiled threat that her enemies would bury her. \nAsked by the ABC if she felt guilty for dragging Mr Lawler into the scandal she said: “Of course I do. Sometimes I wish he just would’ve run and not at all got involved, and it would’ve been so far easier if they just killed me early on, destroyed me early on. \n“For Michael Lawler to be removed from office because he’s done the right thing and supported me, then there’s something wrong with this country, something seriously wrong with our political system and the judicial system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:02:55.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
