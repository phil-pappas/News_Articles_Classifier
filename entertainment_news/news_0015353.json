Stine has to be thrilled by his treatment in the new “Goosebumps” movie.\nEven Spielberg’s bio about Lincoln appears to fall short of the detailed research that went into this tribute to Stine and his books about ghouls, werewolves and a ventriloquist dummy.\nBut the good intentions and faithfulness to the spirit of the author come at the expense of important filmmaking things, such as pacing and character development. While it’s a fitting big-screen adaptation of a much-read children’s series, the pleasures diminish if you haven’t read “The Blob That Ate Everyone,” “Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes” and “The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena.”\nMore Information Goosebumps\n★★½\nQuick take: Too many creatures spoil the show\n“Goosebumps” gets off to a solid start, with a lively Danny Elfman score and a buoyant script. Amy Ryan and Dylan Minnette are introduced as vice-principal mother Gale Cooper and high schooler Zach, starting at a new school in a small Delaware town. You can often tell the quality of a movie about teens by how the parents are written, and the banter between the Ryan and Minnette is pleasant, light on angst and fun.\nJack Black materializes as Stine, the author living in seclusion next door with his home-schooled daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush). He’s an angry crank with a secret — his “Goosebumps” books, when opened, come to life.\nThis is where the movie makes its first major misstep. Zach’s ineptitude after an escalating series of misunderstandings is directly responsible for the creatures from the books escaping from their literary cages. From the beginning, it’s clear that in the best-case scenario the protagonist will be back to square one, with (give or take) about $40 million in property damage to the town.\nRather than focus on one of Stine’s stories in the resulting disaster, “Goosebumps” the movie tries to weave in all of them. It’s a fun ride for the kids in the audience, especially the ones who read the books, but it comes at the expense of human interaction. As the evil clowns, dudes with jack-o-lantern heads, giant killer bugs, smaller killer bugs and aliens with freeze rays multiply, they overwhelm everything else you were enjoying about the movie.\nHappily, the filmmakers build a reservoir of good will in the first two acts. An inept policeman and his overzealous trainee ( Timothy Simon and Amanda Lund ) display excellent comic timing in a pair of scenes. An abandoned amusement park provides a nice backdrop for the first moments between Ryan and Hannah.\nAnd while Black’s kinetic personality seems a bit caged as Stine, he gets to cut loose as the voice of ventriloquist dummy Slappy. A lot of the characters have good chemistry in this movie, and that includes Black with himself.\nOne note for parents: While the film’s content falls squarely within the PG rating, it provides about 20 percent more visual terror than you’re probably expecting. Plus, the presence of a scary clown should automatically trigger a special MPAA rating. (PG-C?) Take your 5-year-old knowing that you’ll be seeing him in your bed every night for the next two weeks.\nRunning time: 102 minutes\nMPAA rating: PG (scary images)", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793626/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793622/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793629/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793628/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793621/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793622/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793621/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793625/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793626/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793623/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793629/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793624/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793627/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793628/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793625/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793627/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793624/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/70/8793623/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:47:02.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
