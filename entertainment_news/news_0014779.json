The grinning clown in front of Vermont’s Ronald McDonald House comforted critically ill kids before doctors’ appointments, greeted the anxious families of hospital-bound tots and served as a backdrop for final photos of dying children.\nFor 15 years, the Ronald McDonald statue was a small sign of happiness for families facing medical nightmares — until vicious vandals burned and beheaded the cheery clown, house staffers said.\n“Some of the last pictures families have of their dying children are of them on Ronald’s lap,” the Burlington house’s Executive Director Kristine Bickford told the Daily News. “This is not just a Ronnie with the hamburger in front of a McDonald’s. This is a sacred place.”\nThe house’s namesake clown, which had been stolen and replaced once before, was attacked three times in a month, forcing staffers to remove his decapitated body from the bench where he sat since 2000.\n“The kids were just traumatized,” Bickford said. “And when guests who stayed here in the past heard about it, they were devastated.”\nRonald McDonald House Charities The happy clown sat in front of the house since 2000. The Ronald McDonald house provides housing to families who need to be close to the nearby University of Vermont Medical Center. Since opening its doors in 1984, thousands of critically ill children and their families have lived in the 11-room home.\nThe iconic clown statue, which was first erected in 2000 and replaced after it was stolen in 2005, was burned last month, Bickford said. A volunteer quickly repainted his silly grin and scarlet hair.\nVandals struck again earlier this month and chopped off Ronald’s head. The next night, the trespassers sawed off the statue’s red-and-yellow shoes.\n“It's just not funny,” Fannie Hart — who is living at the house while her son, Xavier, undergoes treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma — told WPTZ. “It's the last place where you'd want to hurt someone.”\nRonald McDonald House Charities The red-and-yellow jokester was stolen in 2005, but the staff quickly replaced him with a lookalike statue. Fearing copycat attacks on other Ronalds, Bickford planned to keep quiet about the damage. But after a former resident penned an emotional letter about what the goofy-grinned clowned meant to her, the staff decided to start a fundraiser to replace Ronnie.\n“You entered a haven for the desperate, and your actions affect the most vulnerable,” Emily May wrote in the open letter to the vandals, which the Ronald McDonald House provided to the News. May spent a month at the house during a high-risk pregnancy that required her to stay within 20 minutes of the hospital.\nMay continued: “There are very few places in this world that are maintained solely to help others; solely to meet needs in a time of desperation and sorrow. When you hopped that fence, you entered one of those places.”\nBickford said that’s when she realized the “the enormity of Ronnie.”\nRonald McDonald House Charities The house is fundraising to replace the beloved clown. The house’s staffers set up the online fundraised Wednesday. The new figure will cost $7,550 because Ronald is “very hard to manufacture,” Bickford said.\nBy Thursday, they had collected more than $3,000.\n“We’ll get him back,” Bickford said. ‘But this time, he’s staying in the living room.”\nmwagner@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories ‘Hamburgler’ steals McDonald's donation boxes from Florida drive-thrus Family still searching for stolen Ronald McDonald statue Ronald McDonald gets makeover, says he is ready for selfies", "external_links": ["http://www.wptz.com/news/vandals-burn-decapitate-cut-feet-off-ronald-mcdonald/35966280"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:27.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
