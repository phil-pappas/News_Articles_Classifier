A tribute for the underpaid and the overworked, the video shows the quartet fantasizing about living as rich people with money just thrown at them and raked like leaves. The video is directed by Isaac Rentz who also helmed the band's \"She's Kinda Hot\", \"Good Girls\", \"Amnesia\" and \"Don't Stop\" videos. Michael Clifford takes a job in hot dog costume, Ashton Irwin entertains children as dinosaur, Calum Hood walks multiple dogs and Luke Hemmings gets stuck in an internship. \"Hey Everybody\" is a single from their sophomore album \" Sounds Good Feels Good \" which is set for release on October 23. The song samples \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" by Duran Duran . In addition to the video, the band announced \"Sounds Live Feels Live\" tour which kicks off July 2016 in Uncasville, CT.
