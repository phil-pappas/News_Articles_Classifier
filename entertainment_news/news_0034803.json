Anna Chancellor (Ian West/PA) \nMark, also known for his roles in The Full Monty and Remember Me, will play DS Derek Sands, an experienced police detective who has found himself left behind by younger and more ambitious officers. \nThe actor said of his new role: “There’s nothing better than an Anthony Horowitz crime story, and New Blood had me hooked from the first read of the script. I’m looking forward to playing the rough and cynical character of Derek Sands.” \nAnna, who has also starred in Four Weddings And A Funeral and The Hour, plays Eleanor Davies, the director of the Serious Fraud Office. \nShe said: “It’s brilliant to be part of New Blood and to be playing the fierce Eleanor. I’ve long admired Anthony Horowitz’s work and look forward to bringing his modern and exciting script to screen.” Anthony Horowitz (Ian West/PA) \nNew Blood, a seven-part major new series by the best-selling author and screenwriter, tells the story of junior investigators Stefan (Strepan) and Rash (Tavassoli), who work for different law enforcement divisions and are brought together by two seemingly unrelated cases. \nAlso joining the cast are Dancing On The Edge’s Ariyon Bakare, Fresh Meat’s Kimberley Nixon and Aiysha Hart, who has had roles in Atlantis and Honour.
