(Elodie Reed / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nReleased from Vermont custody, actor Randy Quaid and his wife said Thursday they will now turn their attention to resolving 5-year-old criminal charges in California that they squatted in a home they once owned and vandalized the property. \nA Vermont judge dismissed fugitive-from-justice charges against the couple and released them, citing discrepancies in some dates and saying she couldn't find probable cause to support the accusations. \nThe Quaids are wanted in Santa Barbara, California, on felony charges filed in 2010 after they were found living in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned. Court papers said the Quaids damaged or destroyed furniture, a fireplace and a mirror. The couple fled to Canada and were arrested in Vermont last Friday while trying to re-enter the U.S. \nAfter they left the courthouse Thursday, the Quaids said they'll stay in Lincoln, Vermont, to care for Evi Quaid's ailing father and address the California charges. She grew up in Vermont. \n\"I never worried about being found guilty or any of that for any of these charges because I know the truth, and I know the facts are going to come out at some point, and today was a good sign of that,\" Randy Quaid said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:29:01.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
