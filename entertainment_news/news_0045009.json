It almost looks like an ascendency into heaven.\"\nThe artist's ability to strike a dichotomy between the abstract and the real was one of the things Martin said drew him to Harris' work.\nHe'd discovered him years ago when he'd mistaken a Harris painting for one by prominent American landscape artist Rockwell Kent.\n\"I started saying that was the best Rockwell Kent I've ever seen,'\" he recalled with a chuckle. \"And I looked down below and it said Lawren Harris.\"\nIntrigued, he began studying the painter, eventually acquiring three of his works and adding them to a collection that includes pieces by Picasso, Georges Seurat and Edward Hopper.\nView gallery In this Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015 photo, curator and actor-comedian Steve Martin poses for a portrait  … None of those pieces are included in the Hammer exhibition, however.\n\"My pieces are minor,\" Martin said dismissively. \"This is basically a museum show.\"\nStill, one of them was good enough to captivate the Hammer's executive director, Ann Philbin, who saw it during a dinner party at Martin's house.\nWhen she asked who the artist was, the entertainer waxed on about the brilliance of this man from Canada whose work from the 1920s to the mid-1930s defined his country's image as the great, unspoiled frozen North. But whose reputation is unknown south of the Canadian border.\nHarris, who died in 1970, turned to abstract expressionism later in life, but this exhibition focuses strictly on his Canada-defining landscapes.\nView gallery In this Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015 photo, curator and actor-comedian Steve Martin poses for a portrait  … After concluding the artist was someone U.S. arts patrons needed to know about, Philbin approached Martin about curating a show.\n\"The first response in my mind was, 'Of course not,'\" he recalled. \"But then I thought, well, I do know a lot about him.\"\nBut the deciding factor, he said with a robust laugh, was when he realized, \"Nobody else is going to do it.\"\nTechnically, Martin had curated one other exhibition, of his personal collection at Las Vegas' Bellagio Hotel in 2001. But he said that didn't count. \"It's easy to curate your own collection. You just put 'em all in a museum.\"\nWith help from Hammer curator Cynthia Burlingham and Art Gallery of Ontario curator Andrew Hunter, he spent three years putting this show together.\nIt was no easy task given that the paintings came from museums all over Canada that were not anxious to loan their most iconic treasures.\nThe result, Hammer officials say, is that these 32 paintings have never been seen in one show before and likely never will be again.\n\"Steve was not invited to curate this because he's a celebrity,\" Philbin said. \"However, I have to admit that because he's Steve Martin I think it gave us access to works that we might not have gotten otherwise.\"\nHumanities Visual Arts Steve Martin Lawren Harris Canada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:28:00.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
