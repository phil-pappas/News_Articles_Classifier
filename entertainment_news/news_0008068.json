The Yellow Boat is based on the true story of Benjamin Saar, who was born with hemophilia and died in 1987 at the age of 8 of AIDS-related complications. The play was written by Benjamin’s father, David Saar. Along with the joys and sorrows of a “normal” childhood, the play traces Benjamin’s short life as he and his family face the special challenges of hemophilia and contracting HIV through a blood transfusion in the 1980s. Though it sensitively explores the serious issues of AIDS in the 1980s, this is a play about the celebration of a child’s life and a tribute to all children. The story is told through Benjamin’s eyes and his artwork. Benjamin’s imagination transformed his physical and emotional pain into a glow of colors and shapes in his drawings and paintings that inspired all of those around him. It is about the power of imagination and art to transform our lives and make them full of color, energy, humor, and hope. Indian River’s production of The Yellow Boat is non-realistic. The audience will use their imagination to follow the symbolic filled story of Benjamin’s life. The drawings come to life in a three-dimensional dance, utilizing silks, ribbons, instruments, and even hula- hoops. The cast comprises of Sheldon Bush (Benjamin), Alyssa Sands (Mother), and Noah LaClair (Father). Aleisha Cooke, Amiere Bell, Hannah Bajakian, Bannon Montgomery, and Maria Miller portray multiple characters throughout the show, including young children, doctors, and teachers. The show’s understudy is Justin Nadal. Misty Rodriguez is the stage manager. Kristie Fuller is directing the piece with the assistance of Elaine Finley. Lindsay Myers designed the set, lights, and costumes. Each performance is ASL Interpreted for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community. Autographed Broadway merchandise items have been donated for a silent auction to benefit Broadway Cares Equity Fights AIDS. ACR Health will be setting up a booth for each performance. Additionally, an HIV Consultant will be available to lead a talk back after the show. Tickets cost $5 each and can be purchased at the door or reserved by contacting Elaine Finley at 315-642-5521 or elainefinley@ircsd.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:40:05.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
