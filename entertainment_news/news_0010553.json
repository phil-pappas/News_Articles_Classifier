She ultimately concludes that she's \"over\" finding adorable ways to state her opinion. \nLenny is a recently launched weekly newsletter from Lena Dunham and her \"Girls\" executive producer Jenni Konner. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:37:28.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
