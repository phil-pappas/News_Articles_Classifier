The studio's president Kathleen Kennedy revealed that the new \"Star Wars\" trilogy would be about the Skywalker family and might include at least one new character from \"The Force Awakens\". \"The Saga films focus on the Skywalker family saga,\" she told Costco Connection magazine. \"The stories follow a linear narrative that connects to the previous six films. 'The Force Awakens' follows 'Return of the Jedi' and continues that generational story.\" There has been no detail yet about the film and since the last name of Finn ( John Boyega ) and Rey ( Daisy Ridley ) are still unknown, there is a speculation that one of them belongs to the Skywalker family and will appear in the new saga. While the new saga will center on the Skywalker family, Kennedy hinted that \"Star Wars\" anthology series, which starts with \" Rogue One \", would feature totally new storylines. She also provided some other information about the movies regarding the characters and genres. \"The anthology films offer opportunities to explore fresh characters, new storylines and a variety of genres inside the 'Star Wars' universe,\" said Kennedy. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is due to arrive in the U.S. on December 18, while \"Rogue One\" is slated to be released Stateside on December 16, 2017. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Star Wars: The Force Awakens News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:24:54.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
