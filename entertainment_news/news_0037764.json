Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did.” \nShe described turning 25 last year as “a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my twenties.” \nBeyond that, there was nothing in her note about the son she has with businessman Simon Konecki, or other specifics about her life now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:15:35.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
