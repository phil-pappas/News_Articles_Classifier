As a matter of fact, the American Humane Association [AHA] holds its annual “ Adopt-a-Dog Month every October and for the best reasons. Many deserving, wonderful pooches, both large and small or young and old, await a kind-hearted human to bring them home. AHA has chosen October to bring the plight of so many needy dogs to the public’s attention. Today is Oct. 4, 2015, and the Adopt-a-Dog campaign is well under way. The hope is that many people will look deep into their hearts and open them to cherish a dog by sharing a forever-loving home with them.\nWinston at age 8. Winston was a castoff when he was 4. A relative had to give him away or put him in the pound Heidi Rucki View all 18 photos Angie Gardner There are way too many dogs awaiting a cruel fate in shelters across the United States. All too often and in a lot of shelters, time starts ticking away before these innocents can find homes. The public must understand that far too many shelters are kill shelters, and dogs [and cats] are not kept forever – time, space, need and demand forces them to euthanize the most amazing pets, from puppies to purebreds to remarkably loving dogs. And, sadly, this is no fault of the dog. It is the crush of numbers at shelters that forces the cruel annihilation of perfectly wonderful pets. The no-kill shelters keep dogs for long periods of time, if necessary. These shelters specialize in tried-and-true pets that are available right now to move, and they want to be with you to adore you and seek your love and attention. In no-kill shelters, fewer dogs can be accommodated and everything depends on potential owners.\nCountless groups and individuals have undertaken private rescues of dogs from the higher volume and kill shelters to foster and rehome them, going so far as to transport the pooches out of state to save their lives. Sometimes the new owners see only pictures of the potential pet and adopt them on the word of those that work with the animals. Don’t count such rescues out – the cream-colored Pomeranian in the pictures attached to this article is a dog from South Carolina that shipped to Connecticut. People give their time and money on behalf of innocent pets to selflessly assist in saving their lives and finding them great homes and providing transportation.\nAlso attached is the picture of a remarkable shelter dog named Cooper Gardner. You can connect to this handsome Pomeranian on his Facebook page . He is talented, smart and accomplished in anything asked of him. He performs like a star in agility and obedience, he is an accredited therapy dog, he struts the catwalk with human models, is a product-promotion genius, and an incredible model. Someday he will probably star on television or in the movies. This little guy was found in a shelter where someone had placed him for reasons unknown.\nThe point is that amazing dogs find their way into shelters and it’s rarely the dog’s fault. Probably the larger number of dogs are at the shelter because they somehow lost their home. But have a look at their sweet faces and realize they are hoping you’ll fall in love with them as they will definitely fall in love with you. There is no more grateful dog than one rescued into a loving home.\nThe AHA is also hoping to place many of their senior pets. As might be expected, the unfortunate senior dog is often left behind at the shelter while the youngsters and puppies are snapped up. Yet the senior dogs would most appreciate a good, safe home. They cannot talk or beg, but if you desire to make an impact on a deserving dog, it is the senior dog that has the most urgent need. The older dog is past all the puppy chewing, is less boisterous, is usually house-trained, is great for busy lifestyles, appreciates you, and unconditionally loves you.\nIn the attached pictures, Winston is now 15 and in his twilight years. Spazzie is 8 and Ozzie is about 6. The newest of the bunch, Penny, is a young dog, probably around 2. Winston is the only dog that did not come from a shelter but, still, he was a giveaway from a relative who no longer wanted him because he barked and piddled. When he joined the family, he was the best dog ever! None of those habits stuck! He simply needed a little attention, care, and pit stops, and to the present, Winston has never been a problem. He is also responsible for appreciation of the Pomeranian breed in his second home. The other three dogs are all from the shelter. Spazzie is a mix [Pom and Peke] and a stunning dog. Ozzie is pure Pomeranian and Penny is a Standard Poodle. Acquaintances have shelter dogs, all mixed-breeds, and each is a success story. One is a bona fide hero to the family. Several are therapy dogs.\nBelieve it, the joy is huge when you rescue an innocent animal – cat or dog or any needy pet, including horses. Their lives are on the line and they need people to love them, care for them, and provide comfort and safety. In return, they give unconditional love, are wonderful for health and blood pressure.\nAnd, finally, if it just is not possible to adopt a pet, consider giving a donation or two to your favorite shelter. Sometimes it’s just not possible to have a pet. Yet a few dollars now and then or a contribution of feed or dog beds go a long way, too. Any effort by caring people is most appreciated at shelters.", "external_links": ["http://www.americanhumane.org/", "http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/october-is-american-humane-association-s-adopt-a-dog-month.html", "https://www.facebook.com/cooper.gardner.1?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:43:35.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
