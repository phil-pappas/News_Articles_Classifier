In fact, rust is the perfect blend of two Pantone fall 2015 colors: oak buff and marsala. Who's wearing it? \nAnybody on the quest for the perfect, vibrant neutral. Would Elizabeth wear it? \nThe burnt-orange version of the hue is truly my friend - especially as a lipstick. I'm on the lookout for the perfect pair of rust cords this winter, too. Should you wear it? \nYes. A chunky rust necklace and cream sweater dress is sweet, and a rust envelope clutch and black pantsuit is businesslike - especially if you slip into a pair of rust pumps. But if you can manage to snag a fierce microsuede rust moto jacket to wear with distressed boyfriend jeans, please opt for the version without fringe. The too-western look will kill your cool-girl vibe. \n215-854-2704 \n@ewellingtonphl \nOver-the-knee boot, De Blossom, $90; tote bag, Street Level, $88; microsuede shorts, Solstice, $50; all available at Alica DiMichele, the Promenade at Sagemore, 500 Rt. 73 S., Marlton, 856-489-4494, www.aliciadimichele.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:27:03.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
