I’ve heard some people say that I’m not making an album for a long while but that is false.\n“I’m already writing my album. I’ve got the title and I’ve got two songs I’m absolutely in love with. I’m a songwriter and an artist and I think and breathe my second record every day of my life. I will bring my album out in the next year or so, but it’s not going to be immediate because I think people are going to get sick of me if I brought an album out next week.”\n 9:52 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:20:21.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
