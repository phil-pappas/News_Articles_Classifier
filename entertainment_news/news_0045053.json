According to talk in urological circles the device had failed because Frank tried to use it too soon.\" \nMia Farrow has previously hinted her son Ronan was fathered by Frank, not her former partner Woody Allen, but the book insist the claims can't be true because the crooner was incapacitated when Ronan was conceived. \nAccording the the author, Frank was hospitalised with a severe stomach condition known as acute diverticulitis after collapsing while on stage in October 1986 and subsequently had a section of his intestine removed and a colostomy bag attached for several months. \nThe book notes: \"Sometime in March, Mia Farrow, then living in New York and in the midst of her 13-year relationship with Woody Allen, conceived a child. \n\"Mia Farrow claimed that Ronan \"might 'possibly' have been sired by Frank Sinatra who was in Hawaii and Palm Springs all the while, wearing a colostomy bag and close by his ever watchful wife [Barbara].\" \nAnd the 'My Way' hitmaker's daughter Tina is also reported to have said her father had had a vasectomy long before Ronan's 1987 conception. bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:38:28.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
