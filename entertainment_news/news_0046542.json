During a New Yorker Festival panel on Sunday, October 4, the Emmy-winning actress said scheduling conflicts were behind the decision to use the split-screen technique for the now infamous scene. \"It's totally gossip,\" Margulies responded to the feud rumors. \"There's no story there. ... I feel people just like to have gossip or make something into something that isn't there.\" She went on explaining, \"It was shot the way Robert wanted to shoot it, and the story line, too. You also have to remember, there's difficulty ... [Panjabi] was also doing another show, called 'The Fall'. I went along with whatever Robert asked me to do and I did it happily.\" However, Panjabi begged to differ. Sharing her side of the story, the Kalinda depicter posted on Twitter, \"@TheFallTV was not even in production at that time and I was in New York ready to film the scene!\" in addition to a link to an article of Margulies' interview. Margulies and Panjabi hadn't appeared together in the same scenes in the last few seasons before the now infamous split scene in the sixth season finale. When asked about the matter, Panjabi told EW in May, \"I think that's a question you need to ask the producers.\" Margulies also downplayed the rumored feud as saying earlier this year, \"There's no animosity on my part. It's a shame, because I wonder if it was two men, when one finds out that he f***ked his best friend's wife, if it would get that same attention, you know what I mean?\" She was referring to Kalinda's one-night stand with Alicia's husband Peter on the show. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:45:49.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
