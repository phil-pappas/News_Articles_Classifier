The campaign aims to break the stigma of autism and help kids find common ground despite the potential barriers in communication. \nJeanette Betancourt, senior vice president of community and family engagement at Sesame Workshop, told People , \"Children with autism are five times more likely to get bullied. And with one in 68 children having autism, that's a lot of bullying. Our goal is to bring forth what all children share in common, not their differences.\" \nAutism spectrum disorders affect brain development in children, mostly causing difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication throughout their lives. Boys are up to five times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism. (Video via The National Autistic Society ) \n\"Sesame Street\" has used its furry friends to tackle tough issues before. In 2002, the show added Kami, who was HIV-positive.
