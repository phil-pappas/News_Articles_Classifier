It is not related to the Miss Universe or Miss America organizations. The pageant \"celebrates today's married woman,\" according to Rhonda Gilliam, Mrs. Alabama America's executive director. \nAs part of their Mrs. America duties, titleholders spend time speaking about causes important to them. Gwin's is overcoming obstacles because she survived a bad car accident according to Gilliam. \"She was told she may never walk again,\" she said. \nGwin recovered and will share her story of determination with others as she makes appearances all over the country. She hopes to encourage others to never give up. \"She has really overcome a lot in her life and she just wants to share with others that they can do the same,\" Gilliam said. \nGwin, a University of Alabama graduate, is no stranger to the new spotlight on her life. She was crowned Miss Alabama USA 2011 and was named the second runner-up in the 2011 Miss USA pageant. (She later crowned Katherine Webb McCarron, Miss Alabama USA 2012, her successor.) \nIn 2013, she competed on NBC's \"Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls\" with then fiancé Ryan. The show was an adventure reality series that pitted 10 teams of two against each other to survive in the wilds of New Zealand. The two are now married and raising their infant son in Mobile. \nGwin is the fourth Mrs. Alabama to be named Mrs. America. She will crown Candace Schmersahl, of McCalla, as the new Mrs. Alabama America 2015 in an upcoming ceremony. Schmersahl will assume the duties of Mrs. Alabama until the the new Mrs. Alabama is crowned on March 26 at Indian Springs Town Hall. \nWatch below as actress Florence Henderson names Gwin as Mrs. America 2015.
