This event will go down in Kansas City at the Kansas Speedway with 2014 winner Joey Logano among the favorites to win on Sunday. However, Kevin Harvick leads in terms of odds to win the Sprint Cup title and also has a good shot to claim the victory for this race. The NASCAR live streaming online and TV coverage of Sunday’s race will be presented by the NBC network and its affiliate stations around the United States.\nAccording to Sporting News in their Oct. 16 report, Brad Keselowski claimed the pole for the 43-car field in Sunday’s race. Keselowski posted a lap of 195.503 miles per hour during the final round of qualifying on Friday at the 1.5-mile track. Carl Edwards was right behind him with a speed of 195.454 mph on his qualifying lap. Those two drivers will be in the No. 1 and No. 2 positions for the starting grid, with Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick in the second row. Joey Logano, who won the race in 2014, starts in the No. 14 spot.\nOne driver looking for a good finish Sunday to get up higher in the Chase standings will be Dale Earnhardt Jr. as he is currently 19 points behind Keselowski for the final spot to get to the next round of playoff contenders. Ryan Newman and Kyle Busch are also behind Keselowski by a narrow margin. The number of drivers competing in this round of the Sprint Cup Chase playoff round is currently twelve, but after the next two races, it will be trimmed down to just eight drivers total for the new round.\nHarvick is currently the favorite to win on Sunday with odds of 9 to 2, followed by Kyle Busch at 6 to 1. Joey Logano and Matt Kenseth are tied at 7 to 1 odds. Three drivers are tied at 8 to 1 odds including Jimmie Johnson and Kurt Busch. The race at Kansas Speedway will be a part of the Contender Round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, with just one more race, next week’s CampingWorld 500, left on the schedule for the round.
