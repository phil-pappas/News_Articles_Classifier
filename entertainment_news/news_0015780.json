The latest one is a heart attack hoax.Rumours pertaining to Ajith's health spread like wild fire not so long ago, when a shocking message in the social networking site Twitter suggested that the Yennai Arindhaal star was admitted in a hospital after he suffered a massive heart attack. The real worry though was the source of this particular piece of information, for the Twitter account housing Ajith's health status apparently belonged to none other than his manager, Suresh Chandra.When tension erupted among Ajith fans and movie goers, the real Suresh Chandra finally stood up and cleared the air before things got out of control. He wrote on his Twitter page, \"baseless rumours on Mr Ajiths health floated by ugly minnds. Sir is healthy and fine.\"Later it was made known that the fake message that was intitally doing the rounds was the result of a clever photoshop that looked exactly like a screenshot taken from the official Twitter page of Ajith's manager. Now, that's technology being used for wrong reasons, which is not new in the world of cyber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:02:15.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
