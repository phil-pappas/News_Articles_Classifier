Ali McGregor performs Alchemy at The Clink Theatre on October 28. PICTURE: SUPPLIED Source: Supplied \nTAKING the music of some of the world’s best known artists and transporting them back in time could be a recipe for disaster. \nBut Australian cabaret star Ali McGregor is no novice when it comes to the performing arts and in her show Alchemy audiences can judge for themselves if she’s got the right recipe. \nA former soprano for Opera Australia, McGregor’s credits include a Green Room Award. She was announced as the new co-artistic director of the famous Adelaide Cabaret Festival earlier this year. \nMcGregor (pictured) will perform Alchemy at Port Douglas’ Clink Theatre on October 28. The show sees the celebrated cabaret performer sing pop songs as old-time jazz pieces. \n“ Alchemy is the merging of my two musical loves really,” explains McGregor. \n“When I first started singing, I had a fantastic jazz teacher who told me to go and listen to all the jazz greats: Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan.” \nMcGregor says she loved the 40s and 50s jazz standards era, but as a teenager also listened to the popular music found on the Top 40 chart and Saturday Rage . \n“What I wanted to try and do was see if I could merge those two things,” she says. \nThe result is reimagined songs. Take Aqua’s megahit Barbie Girl , to which “something a little bit loungey” is done, according to McGregor. \n“We strip the Best of You by Foo Fighters right down to make it a kind of real torch song, sort of Shirley Bassey-esque torch song.” \nMcGregor will perform with a three-piece band. \n“What I’ve tried to do is just get the absolute best jazz musicians I can,” she says. \nCHECK Ali McGregor performs Alchemy at The Clink Theatre in Port Douglas on October 28.
