VPC\nBill Murray plays a fish out of water in the comedy 'Rock the Kasbah.' (Photo: Kerry Brown, Open Road Films)\n2 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Rock the Kasbah doesn’t take full advantage of star Bill Murray, though at least it makes good use of the Cat Stevens song catalog.\nNot much of director Barry Levinson’s comedy (** out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) actually rocks, even with a talent-laden supporting cast and a plot that uses the culture and society of war-torn Afghanistan as the setting for a timely fish-out-of-water story. In its favor: a breakout performance from Palestinian newcomer Leem Lubany and maybe the most apropos use of Peace Train ever.\nMurray is all crazy hair and wild wardrobe as Richie Lanz, a washed-up rock tour manager who claims he discovered Madonna but has a career mainly based on fleecing prospective “clients,” i.e. untalented rubes willing to hand him a check for services unrendered.\nUSA TODAY\nBill Murray, the star of a new Netflix special, has never watched Netflix\nRichie thinks he’s getting another chance at success when his songbird secretary (Zooey Deschanel) is invited on a USO tour of Afghanistan, though she doesn’t have the stomach for the constant Taliban threat and wearing body armor. She makes off with his cash and passport, leaving Richie high and very dry in Kabul.\nAfter getting involved with some Z-grade bullet salesmen (Danny McBride and Scott Caan), things start to turn around for Richie when he hears teenage Salima Khan (Lubany) singing in a cave. Clad in a red hijab and bearing an angelic voice, Salima realizes her dream of performing on Afghan Star — a Middle East version of American Idol — thanks to Richie, creating shock waves in her country and village, as well as causing dismay for her father, Tariq (Fahim Fazli).\nBilled as a comedy, Kasbah just isn’t that funny. Part of it is Mitch Glazer’s script with American idiots on parade, but a good amount is just from the plot points involved, with warring factions ready to draw weapons on each other and the fact that it’s ultra-controversial for any woman to go on Afghan TV and sing tunes like Wild World in English. (The movie is inspired by the story of Setara Hussainzada, a real-life Afghan Star contestant who weathered death threats for smiling and dancing as she performed and ultimately went into hiding.)\nUSA TODAY\nBill Murray dazzles at first Comic-Con\nWith shades of his Saturday Night Live lounge singer Nick Winters, Murray gets to bust out his own musical chops and go Deep Purple with an over-the-top, out-of-tune sitar version of Smoke on the Water in front of some dumbfounded Afghan guys. But a lot of the actor’s usual mercurial charm isn’t used to full effect and is actually tempered when it doesn’t feel like it should be.\nHis best stuff comes later, when he shows some heart for his new chanteuse and befriends a hooker (Kate Hudson), who acts as Richie’s seductively clad conscience. Totally wasted is Bruce Willis, who has a small role as a gruff mercenary with dreams of writing the Great American War Memoir, but so are most of the actors — the female characters especially take a backseat to Richie's fumbling through the desert and bumbling into war zones.\nHowever, Lubany shines above the A-listers in her supporting role as the shy but committed Salima, a girl who’s obsessed with Stevens and Jimmy Cliff, though it’s never explained why. (Maybe Metallica is too hardcore?) Her eyes have to do a lot of the work when her head is covered, but Lubany shows grace and quiet emotion as a girl who's fueled by her musical passion but repressed by her people.\nShe’s on a roll, even while everybody else fails to rock.\n2 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LPUFUG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/202bc569852a3661aa60beea65f46e607f7359f0/c=28-14-323-309/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809283056549681-Screen-Shot-2015-10-20-at-8.58.02-AM.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388559901001_4388525864001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LPUFUG&text=Review%3A%20%27Kasbah%27%20marks%20rocky%20effort%20for%20Murray&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388559901001_4388525864001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809425999047401-XXX-ROCKTHEKASBAH02-MOV-DCB-74793720.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LPUFUG&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809425999047401-XXX-ROCKTHEKASBAH02-MOV-DCB-74793720.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388559902001_4388525864001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1SmcnUB", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0734be14ba90f649042f09b1fd24fe6223431b51/c=0-0-2571-2571/local/-/media/2015/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635720581417971788-Bill-Murray.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388559901001_4388525864001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/033aca117a1b0546bc30db1c033f5be8efbaddb0/c=457-0-4382-2951&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809425999047401-XXX-ROCKTHEKASBAH02-MOV-DCB-74793720.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1LPUFUG"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:59:26.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
