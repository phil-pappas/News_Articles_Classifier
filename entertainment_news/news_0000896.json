There's no deal if you buy them together. \nIt retails (with actual alcohol inside) for less than $20. \nThe Mets also can't promise that the highest bidder will get exactly what is pictured, with some bottles coming with more wear and tear from celebrating than others. \nThe champagne pictured, technically a sparkling wine since it comes from Spain, retails for about $12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:47:31.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
