No worries. I’m fair game”. \nThe tweet comes a day after radio hosts Stav Davidson and co-host Abby Coleman accidentally started a feud with the actor on Twitter, or so they thought at the time. \nThe brouhaha started when the radio duo tagged Seth Rogen in a tweet as they solicited for people to call in for a talk topic. \n“Who has a celebrity lookalike & are you unhappy about it? Adrian our audio guy got told he looks like @Sethrogen on the weekend!” \nThe hosts probably weren’t expecting the Knocked Up star to see the tweet, let alone respond to it, but that's exactly what happened.
