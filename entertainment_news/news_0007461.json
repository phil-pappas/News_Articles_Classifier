While I'm doing 'Cats' I'll absolutely finish up recording it. Make sure every snare hit and every single guitar line and every single piano riff is all in alignment ... Going into 'Cats' was so crazy, way before I was offered this role by the Andrew Lloyd Webber team, I had called my record 'Feline'. I'm not calling it that now but I had called it that for ages.'' \nMeanwhile, the beauty - who judges on the Australian version of 'The Voice' - says she's been musing on what to do with the next decade of her life. \nAnd asked whether she'll sign up for a fifth season of the talent show after her much publicised spat with fellow judge Jessie J , Delta confessed she's still ''working it out''. \nShe shared: ''I'm just working it out. I mean it's definitely soon (to decide), I've gotta go back and do 'Cats', so that's the next project in my life.'' \nSpeaking about her music, she continued: ''I feel like I've done a full circle and I've gone back to the beginning. I fell back in love with classical pop, with the piano, and I really did, I fell back in love with the instruments. Even though I've always been doing it and back home I've been doing my thing and releasing my records, there was something about the start of the year. And after I turned 30, what is it that I actually want out of life? How do I want to spend my next 10 years?''
