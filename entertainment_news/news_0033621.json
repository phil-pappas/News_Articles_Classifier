The \"Cool for the Summer\" hitmaker smiled widely while the fan presented the photo to her but she refused to sign it. Demi was accompanied by a male security guard when leaving the Heartland Brewery in New York. The \"Heart Attack\" songstress donned a cleavage-baring black jumpsuit paired with a navy long coat. She completed her look with a black clutch and pointy high heels. Tracy Morgan , who hosted the \"SNL\" that night, also attended the after party with his wife Megan Wollover. Other celebrities in attendance included Nick Jonas , Joe Jonas and Gigi Hadid . Tracy wore a black tee paired with a blue jacket and black trousers. Nick entered the venue solo wearing a black hat, a khaki jacket, black pants and white sneakers. Joe and Gigi, meanwhile, rocked matching black-and-white outfits. During the \"SNL\", Demi sang a medley of the title track from her \" Confident \" album and \"Cool for the Summer\" before later performing \"Stone Cold\". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:30:21.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
