The company said it expects a loss of between 3 and 5 cents a share for its third quarter, marking its first quarterly loss since 2010. In July, Xerox expected third-quarter earnings of 17 to 19 cents per share.\nAdjusted earnings for the quarter, excluding the charge, would fall in line of 22 to 24 cents, according to Xerox. After tax, the company said the charge will total $240 million, or 22 cents a share.\nXerox is scheduled to report its latest quarterly results on Oct. 26. Shares were down less than a fraction of a percent on Tuesday to $10.41.\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:17:33.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
