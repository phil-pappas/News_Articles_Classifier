Courtesy Cleveland Museum of Art Not so. The Cleveland Museum of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts in London have put together a lovely bouquet of a show theorizing that the innovations of modernism were at least partially rooted – pardon this and other puns – in the gardens of leading artists who cultivated new ideas about art along with peonies, irises and wisteria.\n\"Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse,\" which debuts Sunday at the Cleveland museum and runs through Tuesday, Jan. 5, shows that to a surprising degree, the avant-garde were avant-gardeners.\nExhibition Review What's up: \"Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse.\"\nVenue: Cleveland Museum of Art\nWhere: 11150 East Boulevard, Cleveland.\nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 11 through Tuesday, Jan. 5.\nAdmission: Adults, $18. For information, call 216-421-7340 or go to clevelandart.org. The evidence is impressive. With 107 paintings from before the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to the beginnings of World War II in 1940, the show is packed with Impressionist garden classics by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cezanne, Camille Pissarro and less widely known contemporaries such as Gustave Caillebotte.\nSeeing their works together makes the point, vividly, that gardening was something of an obsession, especially for Monet and Caillebotte. Their passion spilled over to their friends and jumped beyond France to England, America and the European continent around the turn of the 20 th century.\nThe show is full of surprises, including a bold and gaudy 1911 portrait by the Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla of Louis Comfort Tiffany in a white three-piece suit painting flowers on his Long Island estate.\nLouis Comfort Tiffany, 1911. Joaquin Sorolla (Spanish, 1863-1923). Oil on canvas; 150.5 x 225.4 cm. On loan from the Hispanic Society of America, New York, NY, A3182. Hispanic Society of America, New York, NY, The German-Jewish Impressionist Max Liebermann completed more than 200 paintings of the garden at his suburban villa on Lake Wannsee outside Berlin before his death in 1935. The show includes three remarkably fresh and robust examples, painted with lush abandon in thick, glistening strokes of paint that still look wet.\nCurt Herrmann, another German, is represented by two piercingly beautiful, pointillist-style garden scenes, painted in 1903 and 1905 in electric hues that approach hallucinatory intensity.\nGardens played an important factor, little noted until now, in the art and lives of more famous modernists before and after World War I, such as Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele Munter, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Raoul Dufy, Pierre Bonnard and Henri Matisse, all amply represented.\nRest Time in the Garden, 1914.

Organized by William Robinson, the Cleveland museum's curator of modern European painting and sculpture, and by Ann Dumas of the Royal Academy, the show is a hybrid of art history and the recent literary genre of microhistory , which explores grain-of-sand topics that reveal big truths.\nOne example of the latter would be Dava Sobel's fascinating 1995 book \"Longitude,\" which showed how the development of an accurate and seaworthy chronometer enabled the world's naval powers to hasten globalization and imperialism.\nIn the case of the show, its lush, readable catalog explores the explosion of horticultural knowledge at the end of the 19 th century that was driven by the work of such scientists as Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin.\nAdolphe Monet in the Garden of Le Coteau at Sainte-Adresse, 1867.

The late 19 th century also saw the rise of a middle class able to afford gardens at European villas or country homes or in \"garden cities\" that sprang up along commuter rail and streetcar lines in England and America.\nPlanners and landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted endowed rapidly growing industrial cities with parks and pleasure grounds, democratizing public space and creating places where social classes could mix. Magazines, books and horticultural expos fed the new enthusiasm.\nAll of this was catnip for artists – particularly for Monet. He dominates the exhibition from beginning to end with more than two-dozen canvases.\nThey range from small, gemlike images painted in the 1860s and '70s \"en plein air,\" or outdoors, to a panoramic trio of unified water lily paintings, which together envelop viewers in a bath of colored light reflected on the surface of the pond Monet created at his property in Giverny, about an hour west of Paris in Normandy.\nWater Lilies (Agapanthus), c. 1916-26. Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926). Oil on canvas; 200 x 426.1 cm. Saint Louis Art Museum, The Steinberg Charitable Fund 134:1956. Saint Louis Art Museum, The Steinberg Charitable Fund Owned by the Cleveland museum, the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, and the St. Louis Art Museum, the three big paintings were finished in 1926, the year of the artist's death.\nReunited in Cleveland for the first time since 1980, they are joined together to form a single image measuring 41 feet across and 6.5 feet high. They constitute a spectacular climax, worth the $18 price of admission alone.\nThe exhibition is organized roughly in chronological order, which underscores the fact that Monet's career spanned and leapfrogged the garden-inspired developments of his contemporaries in movements such as Pointillism, Symbolism, Fauvism and Expressionism.\nMonet's ability to portray natural light and weather with uncanny acuity unfolded with a steady evolution that makes it possible to tell the year in which he completed his paintings simply by looking at his brushstrokes.\nFor example, an 1867 scene of Monet's father, Adolphe, reading a newspaper on a bench in the Sainte Adresse garden of the artist's aunt, is made with discrete, flat, confetti-like strokes that fit together tightly almost like tiny tiles in a mosaic to capture the brilliant light of a seaside town.\nBy the 1910s and '20s, half a century later, Monet was painting in a way that anticipated American Abstract Expressionism, with big, gestural strokes that impart a trembling, overall energy, like ripples on water.\nWhile the show uses Monet's career as its spine, it also pays due respect to Renoir, who favored the lush, wild-looking gardens in vogue in late 19 th -century England, and Pissarro, whose socialist sympathies led him to paint market gardens as a salute to common, utilitarian landscapes.\nGarden Study with Lucia and Kate Millet, 1886. John Singer Sargent (American, 1856-1925). Oil on canvas; 61 x 91.4 cm. Private collection, Washington, DC. Private collection, Washington, DC. The American John Singer Sargent, another enthusiastic painter of gardens, is represented by a quartet of delightful if minor paintings, one of which, a study of poppies, was a rehearsal for his 1886 masterpiece, \"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,\" which shows children lighting paper lanterns in a garden at dusk.\nThe Tate in London, which owns the painting, wouldn't lend it either to Cleveland or the Royal Academy, Dumas said. That's a pity, because the middle section of the exhibition could have used one or two additional counterweights to Monet, like the famous Sargent.\nOn the other hand, the show convincingly demonstrates the internationalism of the garden painting movement in unexpected ways.\nGardens of Monforte, 1917.

Outstanding in this regard are a trio of elaborate landscapes by Pablo Picasso's Barcelona friend Santiago Rusinol, whose somber scenes of Spanish royal gardens communicate, among other things, the decline of his country's imperial reach after the Spanish-American War, as the show's catalog notes.\nWar is another recurring theme, revealed in part through biographical details such as Monet's patriotic refusal to leave his Giverny garden and studio in the fall of 1914, even though German troops were closing in on Paris.\nWar is also present, in subtle ways, in the garden paintings of Matisse, including the Cleveland museum's own \"Interior With an Etruscan Vase,\" painted in Nice on the French Riviera in 1940, which depicts a pretty woman seated at a table covered with fruit and surrounded with potted plants.\nHenri Matisse: \"Interior with an Etruscan Vase,\" 1940. Courtesy Cleveland Museum of Art As the show's catalog and labels point out, the window in the room is blacked-out as a precaution against bombing; the luminous rectangle behind the seated woman is actually a painting.\nIn Matisse's work, the garden has moved inside the artist's apartment, because the world outside has become too dangerous. The painting has become a garden for the mind, which seems the inevitable outcome of the trajectory traced by the show.\nCleveland is certainly lucky to have such a big, vibrant and stimulating exhibition in its newly renovated and expanded museum.\nIt's a welcoming sign that, after having spent nearly a decade on its physical renewal, the museum is focusing again on one of its most important tasks: assembling exhibitions that no other institution in Ohio could attempt or afford.", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2002-11-03/the-pages-of-history-writ-small", "http://www.visitberlin.de/en/event/12-31-2013/max-liebermann-the-garden-paintings", "https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/what-is-modern-art", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)", "https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions-and-events"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:20:48.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
