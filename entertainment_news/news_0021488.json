We'll all be crying on the couch with a pint of ice cream while watching \"Love Actually\" and blaring new music from Adele very soon! \nThe soulful songstress tweeted confirmation that we are on the brink of a new album release. Adele said, \"My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I'm making up with myself.\" \nWait. Making up with yourself? What does that even sound like? For me, its something like, \"Cody, you're better than this!

But rumor has it Adele will release it sometime in November . \nAdele added, \"I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\" \nNo apology necessary, boo.
