The \" American Idol \" alum posted on Instagram an adorable picture of her daughter along with a caption, \"In other news, River's gonna have a little baby brother :) #itsaboy We're so excited!\" A photo posted by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson) on Oct 23, 2015 at 8:59am PDT Clarkson, 33, gave birth to her first child in June 2014. She announced her second pregnancy during a concert in August. \"I was not planning on announcing this. I'm totally pregnant again,\" she told the crowd at the Staples Center, adding that she told them first before her husband. She joked, \"I'm kind of afraid to talk to my husband after this.\" Several months prior to the surprise announcement, the singer said in an interview that she wanted a baby boy, \"Honestly the only reason I am hoping for a boy is because they usually say if you're sick with a girl, you won't be with the boy. And if you are sick with the boy, you won't be with the girl.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:57:21.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
