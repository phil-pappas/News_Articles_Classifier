As Mariano's first ever executive chef, he'll be creating food and teaching kitchen staff for 34 upscale grocery stores, a number that's likely to keep growing.\n\"Bringing me on was a statement,\" LaRoche, 37, said.\nIt also signals that Mariano's is attempting to stay ahead of the trends in a changing grocery store industry, one that increasingly values in-store experience and healthy prepared foods. Gone are the days when a grocery store could be simply that and succeed. Differentiation is the name of the game now, particularly in the Chicago market where high-end grocers are rapidly expanding.\nNationally, the number of grocery stores is declining, a trend characterized by \"consolidation and polarization\" that's expected to continue, said Michelle Malison, an analyst for market research firm Euromonitor. The stores in the high and low end are surviving or even growing while those in the middle are getting squeezed.\n\"Competition is really fierce, and (profit) margins are razor thin,\" Malison said.\nMariano's opened its first Chicago-area store in 2010 in Arlington Heights and will have 34 by month's end. Once Mariano's hits 45 to 50 stores, parent company Roundy's executives have said, the concept could expand regionally beyond Chicago.\nRyan LaRoche named exec chef, culinary VP at Mariano's Phil Vettel The last time Ryan LaRoche was in Chicago, he was head chef at NoMI Kitchen in the Park Hyatt. Now he's about to return, with a most intriguing job title: Executive Chef and Vice President of Culinary for Mariano's.\nWhich means, um, what?\n\"The exact details have to be ironed out,\" LaRoche said,...\nThe last time Ryan LaRoche was in Chicago, he was head chef at NoMI Kitchen in the Park Hyatt. Now he's about to return, with a most intriguing job title: Executive Chef and Vice President of Culinary for Mariano's.\nWhich means, um, what?\n\"The exact details have to be ironed out,\" LaRoche said,...\n(Phil Vettel) Prepared foods and in-store dining options — which include sushi, oysters, BBQ and wine — are crucial to the store identity. At Mariano's stores, perishable food represents 50 percent of sales, compared with 30 to 35 percent in Roundy's more conventional stores in Wisconsin, said Roundy's spokesman James Hyland.\nAnd its perishable food sales — which include prepared foods and in-store dining — have steadily increased in recent years, though Hyland declined to give specific numbers for the privately held company.\nIn his new role, LaRoche will develop recipes for prepared food and for the existing in-store dining options, as well as new concepts for restaurants in future stores. He'll also be working with the Roundy's commissary in Kenosha, Wis., where most of Mariano's prepared foods are made.\nTeaching will be a key part of his job and clearly what most excites LaRoche, who was once head chef for NoMI Kitchen in the Park Hyatt in Chicago, and more recently held the same title at Hyatt's Blue Duck Tavern in Washington, D.C.\nMariano's to open biggest store Jessica Wohl Mariano's is placing its biggest bet yet on the appetite for its upscale treats and traditional groceries with a 90,602-square-foot supermarket set to open Tuesday.\nIt is the chain's largest store to date and is bigger than any it currently plans to open.

It's nearly double the median size for...\n(Jessica Wohl) When he talks about mentoring others, he leans forwards in his seat and his eyes light up. \"I've gone from having 50 employees to soon-to-be 34 stores of people that want to learn how to cook,\" LaRoche said. \"I'm very humbled by that task to think I'll have influence on that many people.\"\nThat's what stood out to Bob Mariano, chairman and CEO of Roundy's, who called LaRoche a \"phenomenal chef\" and an \"exceptional teacher and mentor.\"\nAs a society, we're experiencing a \"renaissance of food interest,\" Mariano said, and hiring LaRoche represented an opportunity to improve upon the culinary culture and set Mariano's apart from other stores.\nIn recent years, consumers have increasingly looked for healthier and tastier food away from home, Mariano said, and the chain's offerings have expanded to meet that need.\n\"The tectonic shift for how we cook and dine will only continue to evolve into an awareness in how we're cooking food, what we're eating, how we're creating it and how we're getting it to you,\" LaRoche said.\nWhat exactly is driving that tectonic shift? Experts have varied opinions.\nFrom a business perspective, in-store experience is more important than ever, given the rise of online shopping and grocery delivery services, said Euromonitor's Malison. \"A unique store experience is really key to bringing people in. You're giving consumers the option to linger and giving them more time for impulse purchases.\"\nPrepared foods and in-store dining carry higher profit margins than regular grocery items. The increased appetite for them also reflects consumers' busy lives and the trade-offs they make, said Joel Whalen, academic director of DePaul University's Center for Sales Leadership,\nConsumers display social status through what they eat, drink, wear and drive, he said. Affording those high-quality items means working longer hours — and having less time to cook.\n\"There's huge pressure for American people to show status,\" said Whalen, an associate professor of marketing at DePaul. \"What kind of reward can you grab quickly and at a reasonable price point, given the long hours you're working?\"\nThere's also the Wal-Mart effect.\nWhen Wal-Mart expanded nationally as a grocery retailer, in the 1990s and early 2000s, traditional grocery stores had to adapt by going even cheaper, which made it harder to compete, or by finding other ways to stand out, such as offering more prepared food, said David Matsa, associate professor of finance at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\nMariano agrees. \"You can't be in the middle. You have to differentiate yourself.\"\nThat's essentially LaRoche's new charge, to lead Mariano's into this fray and to beat the competition with the quality of its food. LaRoche hopes to develop the culinary skills of Mariano's store employees, but he also acknowledged the support of the Roundy's commissary in Kenosha would continue to be critical.\n\"Honestly I've never seen anything so cool in my life,\" said LaRoche after touring the facility recently. \"It's like 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.'\"\nMario Jedwabnik, 62, would be Willy Wonka in LaRoche's analogy, though his official title is vice president of manufactured foods and retail food safety.\nWhen Jedwabnik first opened the plant for Roundy's in 2006, he did so with about five employees who focused on making commodities like bottled water, lemonade and orange juice for its Pick 'n Save stores in Wisconsin and, at that point, Minnesota.\nNow as many as 260 employees work at the facility producing more than 800 food items around the clock, including a vast array of prepared foods. Much of that is driven by Mariano's expansion in Chicago.\n\"It's a fast-moving train,\" Jedwabnik said. \"Bob and I go back many, many years. … I don't want to say I can read his mind but I understand him very well.\"\nIn other words, it's Jedwabnik's job to help push Mariano's ideas to market. As one example of that, Jedwabnik and his commissary staff \"reverse engineered\" the recipe for Mariano's mother's poundcake, which is now sold in stores. \"It took a couple weeks, but we did it,\" he said.\nOn a recent tour of the facility, workers hand-crimped beef pot pies as others nearby breaded chicken for the Chicken Milanese. In other rooms, computers and machinery did the work to produce some 80,000 cartons of ice cream per day.\nIn another room, a woman sculpted small-batch peach gelato, made with flavors imported from Italy, into peaks in a pan.\n\"We have like 10 different manufacturing plants under one roof,\" Jedwabnik said. \"If you were to walk any aisle of the store, you'll probably find something we make.\"\nJust a few weeks on the job, LaRoche wasn't ready to talk about new food items consumers can expect. But his canvas is blank and growing larger by the day.\n\"We want to create concepts that people like,\" the chef said. \"Innovation is a big part of this company and obviously, there's risk to that. But we're not here to just sort of accept what we have.\"\ngtrotter@tribpub.com\nTwitter @GregTrotterTrib\n DePaul University Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-558e9492/turbine/ct-marianos-biggest-store-0628-biz-20150626", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55d7a8e5/turbine/ct-ryan-laroche-named-marianos-executive-chef-culinary-vp", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56217fa2/turbine/ct-marianos-food-chef-1018-biz-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:25:07.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
