A series of what appeared to be standard rooms, including a kitchen, den, living room, garage and backyard, suddenly transformed in response to the rising creative, physical and kinetic energy of house guests.\nTo measure the ebbs and flows of party attendees' energy, Absolut partnered with fashion and technology brand, StudioXO, to create custom biometric bracelets. When collective energy levels reached critical mass, a surprise backyard performance was unlocked featuring Empire of the Sun set against a larger-than-life, electrified Absolut Electrik bottle designed by Tesla Motors.\n\"Music is an intrinsic part of nightlife – it brings people together and serves as a catalyst for raising the energy of a crowd to create out-of-this-world experiences,\" said Emperor Steele of Empire of the Sun. \"Absolut Electrik House gave us the stage to connect directly with the energy of the crowd; putting our performance in the hands of our fans, like never before.\"\nThe transcendent performance is a follow up to the inclusion of Empire of the Sun's single, \"Welcome To My Life,\" which premiered in an Absolut Nights digital and TV creative earlier this summer. Footage captured from Absolut Electrik House will serve as the creative featured in Absolut's new TV advertising launching in late 2015, replacing the current content included in the Absolut Nights films.\nHow to Turn Your Own Night or House Party Electrik\nEach room in the Absolut Electrik House featured an innovative twist on elements from a traditional house party, turning conventional \"house rules\" on their head:\nAbsolut Electrik House Rule #1: Shake up your drink strategy. The Electrik House Way: Drone bartenders flying through the kitchen shaking up Absolut Electrik cocktails. Your Way: Plan ahead by batching two or three cocktails before the party to shake up your average vodka-soda bar. Display them right before guests arrive for the ultimate house party win-win: impressed guests and more time for you to hit the dancefloor. Absolut Electrik House Rule #2: Step out of the auto-shuffle comfort zone. The Electrik House Way: Robot band in the garage and Empire of the Sun in the backyard. Your Way: Instead of hogging the auxiliary cord, invite people to rotate as guest DJ's throughout the night to get people on the dancefloor. Absolut Electrik House Rule #3: Swim upstream in a sea of selfie-sameness. The Electrik House Way: A statically charged floor produced hair-raising Instagrams – literally. Your Way: Have a blank wall? Turn it into an Insta-worthy photo backdrop - bonus points for props, custom hashtags and selfie-sticks. Absolut Electrik House Rule #4: Clear the (dance)floor. The Electrik House Way: A smart dancefloor turned the living room into a living room – the more you moved, the more it grooved. Your Way: Move furniture out of the way to create a makeshift dancefloor, giving your guests the go-ahead to get down.
