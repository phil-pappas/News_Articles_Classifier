Darum haben sich die Entwickler etwas mehr Zeit genommen, doch nun ist er da. \nGleich mehrere Kampagnen-Missionen aus Might & Magic Heroes 7 ließen sich mitunter nicht abschließen , doch das sollte nun überwiegend der Vergangenheit angehören. Denn der erste Patch mit der Versionsnummer 1.2 tilgt gleich mehrere kritische Fehler aus dem Spiel. Zudem verbessert er die künstliche Intelligenz, damit diese schneller agiert, und ändert diverse Werte von Fähigkeiten sowie Talenten ab. \n\nNatürlich soll Might & Magic Heroes 7 durch das Update auch generell besser laufen. Und Limbic widmete sich dem Mehrspieler-Modus bzw. dessen Verbindungsproblemen. Anbei findet ihr die kompletten Patch Notes, welche leider nur in englischer Sprache zur Verfügung gestellt wurden. \n\nCampaign & Walkthrough General [Fixed] The AI heroes may remain stuck in front of their town blocking the human player from attacking the town or the heroes.
