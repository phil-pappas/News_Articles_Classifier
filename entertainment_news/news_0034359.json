Comedian Micah (Katt) Williams and former music mogul Marion (Suge) Knight must stand trial for felony robbery, a Los Angeles judge ruled Tuesday.\nThe decision came after prosecutors played videotape in court that depicted Knight allegedly ordering the crime against a female photographer in Beverly Hills last year and Williams walking away with the woman's camera.\nKnight also is facing a charge of making criminal threats.\nThe ‘90s rap impresario claims paparazzo Leslie Redden is the one to blame, because she crossed the line when she allegedly recorded images of his son in an alley behind a film studio just days after Knight was shot in a nightclub ambush.\n\"Why you taking pictures of my motherf---ing son?\" Knight was heard yelling at Redden in the video of the September 2014 confrontation played in court.\n\"I'll tell you what. I got a bitch that will beat your motherf---ing ass,\" he was heard shouting on the footage Redden shot from a video camera hung around her neck.\n\"Get that bitch over here. Get her s--t,\" Knight was heard ordering shortly before the video went dark because Redden started running away.\nProsecutors also showed surveillance video from a nearby building that depicted Redden fleeing down a nearby street in a yellow dress with an unidentified woman chasing her.\nWilliams, 44, appeared in that video following the two women.\nRedden took the witness stand Tuesday and said she hit her head multiple times during the subsequent assault and ended up on the ground with injuries to her arm and finger.\n\"I just remember looking in his eyes and realizing it was getting very dangerous,\" she said of Knight.\nShe testified that she was physically attacked by the unidentified woman at Knight's request.\nChris Pizzello/Invision/AP Micah (Katt) Williams and Knight are accused of stealing a paparazzo’s camera. \"My head was going back and forth. My head hit a couple things,\" she said. \"Katt Williams pulled my camera off my right shoulder.\"\nRedden testified that she did not take photos of the child and was waiting outside the studio to get photos of Williams, not Knight.\nShe said she believed the child was Williams' son and only captured video of the boy because he happened to walk into her shot during the verbal exchange with Knight.\nRedden admitted under oath that she later uploaded the video to YouTube.\nWilliams argued Tuesday that a felony robbery charge was unwarranted because he was cooperating with the investigation and always believed Redden's camera would be returned.\n\"The moment the camera was taken was not depicted by any video. He filled that in (for police during an interview). It was his understanding the images of Knight's son would be deleted and the camera returned,\" Williams' lawyer Shawn Holley told the court.\n\"Mr. Williams' involvement was very brief, very fleeting,\" Holley said in her closing argument. \"None of the people had an interest in the camera for the value of the camera.\"\nRedden has said she never got her camera back and suffered a concussion as well as long-term physical damage that has affected her ability to work.\nKnight's lawyer Thomas Mesereau argued that Knight never touched Redden, was never seen holding the camera and did not control the woman who attacked her.\nHe said Knight, 50, was only interested in protecting his son.\n\"Mr. Knight got mad. He'd been shot. Someone tried to take his life,\" Mesereau argued as Knight sat beside him in court wearing an orange jail uniform. \"Whoever tried to take his life, he didn't want them to see his son on YouTube.\"\nHe said calling someone names under those circumstances was \"completely legitimate.\"\nAn investigating officer with the Beverly Hills Police Department testified that Knight orchestrated the criminal \"conspiracy\" because he was caught on tape claiming to have a woman who would \"beat\" Redden and then ordering someone to \"get\" her camera.\n\"The two things he said were going to happen actually happened,\" Detective Mark Schwartz testified.\nKnight and Williams were ordered back to court for a follow-up arraignment on Oct. 27.\nWilliams wore a dark suit with a large gold chain around his neck and high-top sneakers. He did not speak during the hearing and declined to answer questions outside.\nKnight remains in custody on a pending murder charge in an unrelated case. In court on Tuesday, when the TV cameras moved in Knight’s direction, he wished his 6-year-old son Legend a happy birthday, TMZ reported.\nKnight is accused of running over and killing Los Angeles businessman Terry Carter during a parking lot fight with another man earlier this year.\nThat case was set for another pre-trial hearing Dec. 11.\nHis lawyers said in court they're seeking permission for Knight to receive visits from his children and their legal guardians while he's incarcerated under a strict protective order.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
