Â© C. S. Bauer/ClassicStock/Corbis \nLet's start our list of famous sideshow entertainers by addressing language. \"Freak\" has long been a tricky word to use when describing folks in the sideshow community. It's no mystery that it has been used as a derisive, offensive term in the past, and it still can be a terribly hurtful word.
