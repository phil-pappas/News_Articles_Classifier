PETERSBURG, FL (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nMore than 130 children in Tarpon Springs have a gleaming new playground thanks to volunteers from Valpak®, the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast, KaBOOM! and the local community. About 160 volunteers gathered on Oct. 9 at the Boys & Girls Club of Tarpon Springs to build the playground and create a healthy learning environment for the children. The design was based on drawings by children at the club as they imagined a new play area.\n“Play, along with learning and good nutrition, is crucial to a child’s developmental success. To encourage this, Valpak supports this playground build as part of ‘Valpak Saves,’ a national campaign to give back across America,” said Michael Vivio, president of Valpak and Cox Target Media. “We are pleased to bring such an invaluable experience to the children, especially considering that the Boys & Girls Club of Tarpon Springs previously lacked any playground equipment.”\nVivio continued, “Valpak Saves is an opportunity for us to stay connected with the communities we serve. We want our neighbors to know us on a deeper level, to know that we value every community as our own and, therefore, are committed to its continued improvement.”\nThe Tarpon Springs playground is the first built by Valpak and the nonprofit KaBOOM! Earlier this year, the partnership was featured on Valpak envelopes sent to nearly 40 million homes across the U.S. and Canada. It’s a key initiative in Valpak Saves to support and inspire play and healthy living within our communities -- part of our effort to help neighborhoods thrive. For more, see Valpak’s Community page that highlights its nationwide nonprofit partnerships and volunteerism.\nValpak’s partnership with KaBOOM! ensures all kids get a childhood filled with balanced and active play. Play provides kids with opportunities to learn and grow. It builds leadership, friendships, fitness, and, ultimately, neighborhoods. With partners across the nation, KaBOOM! has built, improved and opened nearly 16,300 playgrounds, engaged more than 1 million volunteers, and served 8.1 million kids.\nDiscover more about Valpak®\nValpak is at the heart of communities across North America, helping people save, businesses grow and neighborhoods thrive through a network of local franchises in the U.S. and Canada.
