A representative for the Grammy winner confirmed the engagement on Friday. \nGreen will release a new album, “Heart Blanche,” on Nov. 6. \nThe former “Voice” coach said he and James didn’t want to promote their engagement. \n“We’re a collective power together because our private life is sacred. But you know … maybe it is time for the world to know that I have a very secure situation and a loving woman supporting me the entire way,” he said. \nGreen was previously married to Christina Johnson.
