The kids are alright at the Limelight 1 / 1 Back to Gallery On any given night on the St. Mary’s Strip, young people gather at the Limelight. That goes for Mondays, which lately features Girl in a Coma frontwoman Nina Diaz hosting an open-mike night.\nAudiences skew younger here at the recently refurbished music venue than they do at its sister nightclub, the 502 Bar. But it’s not the $60,000 face-lift (really just a little paint, new sound system and a little tender loving care) that draws ’em in.\nDeric Wynne is co-owner of the Limelight and 502 Bar. He books both venues. Jim Meek is the general manager for both. “We’re sister bars,” Wynne explained.\nMore Information Vital data\nWhat: Nina Diaz hosts open-mike night\nWhen: 9 p.m. Mondays\nWhere: The Limelight, 2718 N. St. Mary’s St., thelimelightsa.com\nAdmission: Free\n“I’ve always liked the Limelight,” Wynne said. “I spent some really good times here when I was a little bit younger. I liked the layout and it was already ready to do what we wanted to do. There was already a stage. There were just some things that we wanted to tweak. There was no overhaul.”\nThe Limelight closed at the end of December. It reopened July 9.\nDiaz approached the place with a proposal. She wanted to reprise the vibe of the open mike she ran at Martini Ranch on West Avenue a few years ago. Wynne and Meek jumped at it.\nDiaz, who is reinventing herself as a solo artist (this week she performed in Washington D.C. at a National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts gala celebrating rising stars and recorded an NPR Tiny Desk Concert), seemed perfect for a nightclub scene that’s transformed with places such as the Paper Tiger, the Amp Room, Faust, Botanica, TBA, Hi-Tones, Attagirl and Phantom Room.\n“The Limelight is more of a venue in the true sense of the word. 502 Bar, while we have the capacity for some great shows, and I love the room, but it’s definitely more of a bar,” Wynne said.\n“Here, I can try out much more peripheral things. I can have punk rock and (weird) pop. It’s not that they can’t work at (502 Bar) but it works a little bit better in this area. The demographic is a bit younger, it’s more 21 to mid-30s.”\nThe Limelight capacity is about 240; 502 Bar is closer to 163 capacity but can accomodate about 240 “if we clear out the furniture,” Wynne said.\nNina’s older sister, Phanie Diaz of Girl in a Coma and FEA, often comes out to support her sister’s open mike. She said the Limelight is hip and a good fit.\n“The difference between her at Limelight instead of Martini Ranch is that you get a stage with great sound. There's some equipment available, and if you’re a musician wanting to try a new song out on a real stage, that's the perfect time,” she said.\n“You see all kinds of folks out, different styles. Definitely fun.”\nWynne and Meek are pleased with it and do all they can “not to disturb her flow,” said Wynne. The open-mike crowd has discovered it.\n“We do see some of the same faces at both places. There are some people that do the whole open-mike circuit. I talk to people at Limelight and they say, ‘I’m going to four tonight.’”\nHe loves watching Nina sing and is happy she chose his place. “She really likes to stay involved in the music community. She’s very supportive of the whole idea. She gets up the beginning and performs and it always feels like a show because there are a lot of people that just want to see her.”\nhsaldana@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756553/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/65/8756553/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:35:31.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
