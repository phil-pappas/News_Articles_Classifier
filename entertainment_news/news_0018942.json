We're done. All I want to do is move on. For at least a year or two, I just don't want to think about it. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money. \n\"Now? I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. I don't know what the next step is. I've no idea.\" \nThe Hollywood hunk also offered advice to his successor. \nHe added: \"Don't listen to anybody else. Well, do listen to everybody, but you have to make the choice at the end of the day. It's your bed to lie on. \n\"You've got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now.\" daniel craig", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:40:37.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
