Craft Beer and Cookie Fest \nWhen: 4 to 7 p.m. Saturday \nWhere: Girl Scouts Program Center, 1404 N. Ash St. \nTickets: $15 in advance through craftbeerandcookiefest.brownpapertickets.com , $20 at the door (includes three 4-ounce pours with accompanying cookies and a bratwurst; there’s also an advance option featuring five pours and a souvenir pint glass for $25). Additional tasting and brat tickets will be available individually. You must be 21 or older. \nBeer might not sound as tasty as milk over cereal, but when it comes to cookies, it’s a different story – as the local Girl Scouts organization is about to again prove. \nThe third annual Craft Beer and Cookie Fest on Saturday will feature eight Girl Scout cookie varieties paired with local and regional beers from Black Label, English Setter, Iron Goat, New Boundary, River City, Waddell’s, Alaskan and Lagunitas. \n“With so many breweries in Spokane, it’s a great way to connect with the community in a different way,” said Stephanie May, events specialist for the Girl Scouts of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho. \nWhile events like luncheons appeal to a certain audience, May said, “This has a really wide reach. Sometimes men aren’t as involved in Girl Scouts, and this is a way to get them involved. And they get to drink beer.” \nPairing specific Girl Scout cookies with beer (and wine) has become increasingly popular online in recent years. The local organization’s first event in 2013 attracted about 100 people, and that doubled last year. \nThere also are three new breweries involved this year. Interested brewers got to choose their cookie varieties on a first-come, first-served basis. \n“One of the fun parts of this was going to the breweries, taking them a box of cookies and having them do their own taste-testings,” May said. \nThe results include: Black Label’s Espresso Stout with the iconic Thin Mints. Iron Goat’s Goatmeal Stout with peanut butter Do-si-dos. Waddell’s Vienna Lager and New Boundary’s Porter with shortbread Trefoils. English Setter’s Red Setter Retriever with the caramel-and-coconut Samoas, and On Point Pale with the lemony Savannah Smiles. River City Red with the gluten-free Toffee-tastic. Lagunitas IPA and chocolate-covered peanut butter Tagalongs. Alaskan’s Pumpkin Ale with the new oatmeal Rah-Rah-Raisins. \nAdmission includes a bratwurst sandwich from Nick’s Shameless Sausages – either traditional German or Guinness-flavored – live music by Drew Blincow and games. \nMay also hopes attendees will check out the program center, with such features as a full gym and climbing wall available for both scouting-related events and private rentals. “We have so many great resources that I don’t think a lot of people know about,” she said. Brewery watch Construction is underway at Post Falls Brewing, west of the Red Lion Templin’s Hotel on the north bank of the Spokane River at 112 N. Spokane St. The 15-barrel brewery and taproom, which will specialize in IPAs, is expected to open early next year. Laughing Dog has begun work on its new production facility near the existing brewery north of Sandpoint, which will be converted into a full-scale alehouse with food service. Slate Creek in Coeur d’Alene has added Matt Spann, formerly of the award-winning Idaho Brewing Company in Idaho Falls, as head brewer. Freshly tapped The third and latest fresh hop beer from Trickster’s in Coeur d’Alene, Limelight (6.7 percent alcohol by volume), is brewed with Mosaic and organic Equinox hops for lime and melon notes over a lighter pilsner malt body. Midnight Harvest (5.9 percent ABV, 80 International Bitterness Units), a fresh hop Cascadian dark ale collaboration by Big Barn and the Steam Plant, uses Cascade hops from Big Barn’s farm and Chinooks from a Green Bluff neighbor, along with rich caramel and dark Midnight Wheat malts. The big, fruity, spicy St. Joseph Imperial Saison (9.3, 33), originally brewed for Selkirk Abbey’s first anniversary in 2013, has returned to the Post Falls taproom. Daft Badger in Coeur d’Alene is pouring an All Souls Autumn Ale (7.9, 11) with pumpkin, autumn spices, vanilla bean and spicy Saaz hops.
