Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 3:25 PM Updated at 5:08 PM Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 3:25 PM Updated at 5:08 PM • Ben Carson's appearances PANAMA CITY — He’s rising to the top of presidential polls and on Nov. 1 Republican candidate Ben Carson will make a stop in the Florida Panhandle. The retired neurosurgeon and political newcomer is scheduled for an appearance at the Panama City Books-a-Million at 811 East 23rd Street at 7:30 p.m. that day, according to the website bencarsonbook.com . Carson has written several books, including “A More Perfect Union” and “One Nation.” Carson is also scheduled to appear at a Books-a-Million in Pensacola at 3:30 p.m on Nov. 1 and at a Tallahassee Books-a-Million on Nov. 2 at 11:30 a.m. Further dates will see Carson visit central and south Florida. Carson's book tour will take him to 38 cities in ten states: South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Florida, according to a website affiliated with Carson. “I wrote this book to encourage every citizen to read and think about the Constitution, and to help defend it from those who misinterpret and undermine it,” Carson said on “A More Perfect Union.”“In our age of political correctness it’s especially important to defend the Bill of Rights, which guarantees our freedom to speak, bear arms, practice our religion, and much more.” The Associated Press reported on Sept. 30 Carson raised more than $20 million in the past three months to fuel his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Carson’s run has “tapped [a] wave of anti-establishment sentiment,” the AP said. When Republican and Republican-leaning voters are asked in an open-ended format (no names provided) for their first choice for the nomination, Carson was named by 16 percent, according to figures from the Pew Research Center. Carson is second behind Trump, who had a rate of 25 percent. For more information on the Panama City appearance, the Panama City Books-a-Million can be contacted at (850) 784-3040.
