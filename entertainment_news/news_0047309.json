Kinda like the race between the tortoise and the bad hair.\"\nJay Leno interviewing Paris Hilton and her (now deceased) dog Tinkerbell. \nFallon opened the show but said he had \"pulled a hammy\" on his last joke. \"I don't think I can continue. But of course, here at The Tonight Show , the monologue has to go on. So I think I'm gonna have to sub out. Can someone can tag in for me?\"\nAdvertisement That's when Leno took the stage and launched into his own monologue, eventually getting Fallon to join in.\n. @JayLeno tags in after Jimmy pulls a muscle mid-monologue https://t.co/Z5fsPMJFuA pic.twitter.com/P3EP4BQebD \n— Fallon Tonight (@FallonTonight) October 7, 2015 Leno left the show earlier last year after two decades as host, and The Tonight Show moved back from the West Coast to New York's Rockefeller Centre. \nBefore last night's episode taped, Fallon tweeted the night's guests — Lady Gaga, Ronda Rousey and Hailee Steinfeld — but did not mention Leno, whose recent cameo as himself on the new  Muppets show will be soon followed by a guest appearance alongside Tim Allen on ABC's Last Man Standing .\nLeno famously took the reigns of The Tonight Show from Johnny Carson in 1992, a move which saw hopeful Carson replacement David Letterman to defect to CBS taking his late show format with him.\nConan O'Brien succeeded Leno in 2009 when Leno was moved to a later timeslot with a new show. Both failed to attracted viewers and Leno was brought back to host The Tonight Show . O'Brien then left NBC to star his own late night show, Conan .\nFairfax Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:50:10.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
