But the former Beatle won’t spend a year hunched over a laptop tapping out a  tell-all.\nHe’s telling his story in photos and song.\n“A publisher asked me to write an autobiography, you know, the kind Keith Richards and so many others have done lately,” the drummer said from his Los Angeles home. “But I knew they’d only be interested in the years from 1962 to 1970... So I did an auto­biography in a different way with ‘Photograph.’ ”\nCollected from Ringo’s archives, “Photograph” gathers rare and unpublished snapshots taken by Starr and others that document his childhood, the Beatles and beyond.\nOf course, he will always be most comfortable telling his stories in song. On his new album, “Postcards from Paradise,” Ringo — who brings his All Starr Band to the Citi Wang Theatre on Oct. 23 — spends much of the time in the past. (The title track crams in lyrical references to at least 25 Beatles songs.)\n“I started looking back with ‘Liverpool 8,’ a song I wrote with (producer) Dave Stewart,” Starr said. “And since that (2008) record, I’ve done an autobiographical song with Dave on each album. This one had ‘Rory and (the) Hurricanes,’ about my band before the Beatles.”\nStewart joins a long list of co-writers on “Postcards.” Joe Walsh, Todd Rundgren, Richard Marx and more helped Starr compose tunes.\nWritten and recorded at home, the release reflects Ringo’s jovial, loose personality.\n“I used to have a guest house, but I kicked out the guests, put in a drum kit and ‘Pro Tools’ and made it a studio,” he said. “I’ll work out something on a synthesizer and then play drums over it. When I have that, I’ll bring in the other writers to help, but there’s no set pattern. I love L.A. If somebody rings the bell and they’re a musician, they’re probably on the record.”\nLike Ringo’s records, his tours team him with ace players and alums from rock ’n’ roll’s top bands.\n“There are people who want to be in the band, managers who want their clients in the band and people I want in the band,” he said with a chuckle. “I sit down and listen and try and fit people together who will work well. This lineup is one of the best. (Santana and Journey keyboardist) Gregg (Rolie) is the find of the century, but everyone is great.”\nIf you haven’t seen the All Starrs, you should expect a lot more than Beatles covers. Between solo and Fab Four material, bassist Richard Page will sing hits he penned with Mr. Mister, guitarist Steve Lukather will lead the band through Toto tunes and Rolie will front the group for Santana material.\n“We’re just going into rehearsals, and I’m thinking about January when I’ll start my next record,” Starr said. “I’d like to do a new record every 18 months and a lot more touring. I’m in a great music situation right now, and I want that to continue.”\nThe Citi Wang Theatre hosts “The Ringo Starr Fine Art Show” Oct. 21-23, with proceeds going to the Lotus Foundation. On Oct. 23, before the concert, Starr will appear at a private reception for people who bought signed pieces.
