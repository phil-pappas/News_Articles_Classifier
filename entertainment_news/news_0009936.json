(Photo: Jason Wachter, jwachter@stcloudt) Buy Photo \nA recent study supports what many advocates have been saying for years: The arts aren't just good for St. Cloud's heart and soul; they're good for its bottom line. \nInformation released this week through an effort called Creative Minnesota shows that arts/entertainment made a $12.4 million economic impact for St. Cloud in 2013, the most recent year available. The $12 million is an increase of $2.6 million in economic impact from the last study in 2002, when the total impact was $9.8 million. \nThe study examined 25 local organizations for its information — everything from the Paramount Theatre to Great River Regional Library's arts programming. It looked beyond St. Cloud, too; more than 1,200 organizations participated in the statewide study that showed the arts contributed $1.2 billion to Minnesota's economy. \nMinnesota Citizens for the Arts, the St. Cloud Arts Commission, the Central Minnesota Arts Board, United Arts of Central Minnesota and GREAT Theatre helped release the study. \nThe study indicates that St. Cloud has an active and vital arts scene, said Sheila Smith, executive director of Minnesota Citizens for the Arts. She pointed out that 26 percent of the audience members for arts/culture events are coming from outside the immediate area. \n\"They’re spending money in town that wouldn’t be there otherwise,\" she said. \nEllen Nelson, one of the organizers of St. Cloud's art crawls, said she knows events such as hers have ripple effects. \n\"The people who are involved in the art crawl have come to see that as a time when they can make some money,\" she said. \nThe study's results were \"more validating than surprising,\" said Dennis Whipple, artistic executive director of GREAT Theatre. He noted that the data are a few years old and that organizations such as GREAT are seeing even a bigger impact now. His theater company's audiences come from well beyond a 90-mile radius, he said. \nSt. Cloud's $12.4 million number is made up of $5 million in direct expenditures by the local organizations and $7 million in arts/culture-related spending by audiences. \n\"I was proud of how St. Cloud has evolved into kind of an epicenter of arts activities,\" said Troy Fritz, entertainment chairman for the Summertime by George! celebration, which was included in the study. \nThe study's implications are key, said Bob Johnson, executive director of the Paramount Theatre, one of them being that the arts are integral to making any community more livable. It would be difficult to recruit employees to this area without any sort of cultural attractions, he said. \nPeople need to understand the arts' impact on the economy, and also that artists deserve to make a living wage, Johnson said. He noted the study showed that about 75 percent of the arts audiences are spending an average of more than $20 on costs beyond the ticket price, on expenses such as parking or restaurants. \nDespite the good news for arts organizations, \"we absolutely can do better,\" Johnson said. \"I think with more support from the community at large, we can do better both in experiencing and participating in the arts.\" \nFollow Kate Kompas on Twitter @copygirlkate, or call her at 259-3620.
