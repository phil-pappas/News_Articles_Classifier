When the tracks became too tough, the triumvirate vented tension, finding something between Jacko’s humanistic ballads and Madge’s breathy torch songs. To add variety, they split the difference between hard and soft with detours into new jack swing or Paisley Park grooves.\nThe trio’s inventions took Jackson from forgettable kid sister to icon, from 1986’s “What Have You Done for Me Lately” to 2001’s “All For You.” Then came the inevitable slide.\nJackson and her team began chasing the sounds of a younger artist or rehashing styles that hadn’t been innovative (or interesting) in a decade. Now, seven years since her last release, Jackson has reunited with Jam and Lewis for “Unbreakable.”\n“Hello, it’s been a while, lots to talk about, I’m glad you’re still here,” Jackson coos at the close of the title track, which opens the LP.\nInstead of charging into the record with a grand statement (see “Control,” “Rhythm Nation”), she opens with a stroll, a tender, sincere love letter to her fans.\nUnlike her peers, Jackson doesn’t fear slow-burn R&B. This kind of quiet storm soul shows up again and again, on the big ballad “Well Traveled” and the lead single “No Sleeep.” Repeated listens reveal she learned a lot from Frank Ocean (or maybe it was the other way around). Of course, she’s not afraid to nod at her nasty girl past. (Check out the second single “Burnitup!” featuring Missy Elliott).\nJackson, Jam and Lewis mix their early approach with twitchy, EDM tricks. The results give “Unbreakable” a modern (and occasionally cliched) feel. But the dips into old-school R&B and almost-jazz tones keep ears pricked.\nClicking electro beats jump start “Dammn Baby” but smooth soul and vintage keyboards keep the song driving forward. On “Night,” Janet’s classic vocal sound (think the whispered, layered feel of “That’s the Way Love Goes”) sits atop an instrumental track that winks at Jam and Lewis’ tenure with the Time and new millennium synth pop.\nThe honesty of “Unbreakable” also elevates the LP over its competitors. Above the simple keyboard line and hypnotic snaps of “Broken Hearts Heal,” Jackson eulogizes her childhood with Michael. Janet’s pretty, restrained voice and a plain piano line fill out “After You Fall” — Katy and Beyonce, Britney and Justin would never strip a song this bare.\nJackson has enough diehards to secure a No. 1 debut for “Unbreakable.” After that, she’ll have to hustle to make the album a hit — if she even cares. Judging from these 17 songs, it seems art matters more than success (gasp!). While the music may be engaging, her album doesn’t follow the ubiquitous modern template of bubblegum hook plus disco backbone plus climactic chorus. But it has an ambition that recalls her early breakthroughs, an ambition out of place today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:50:52.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
