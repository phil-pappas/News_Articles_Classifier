Boehner (R- Ohio ) has been in the spotlight since announcing he would step down on Oct. 29 after four years as the majority leader of the House of Representatives .\nNews of Boehner's decision surfaced just a few hours before taping of \"Tonight Show\" typically begins at 30 Rock. But as he was a late add to tonight's episode, \"Tonight\" is not hunting for a replacement but will proceed with the previously scheduled lineup of \"Steve Jobs\" star Michael Fassbender\n, \"Room\" star Brie Larson and musical guest Cee Lo Green\n. Boehner's resignation set off a political horse race in Washington among prospective successors. With the 2016 presidential campaign heating up, politicos have suddenly become a hot ticket for late-night guest bookings.\nÂ© 2015 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:29:21.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
