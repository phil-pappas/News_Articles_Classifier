(AP Photo/John Raoux) Richardson led the Heat with 18 points in 37 minutes, and Winslow added 12 points, 10 rebounds and three assists in 34.\nWinslow has a role for now as the small forward on the second string and is working to solidify his command of Miami’s offense and defense. He has struggled with his shooting during the preseason, but his 6-foot-7, 225-pound physique and overall ability are clearly NBA-ready. He hit 4 of 11 shots against the Magic and is at 32.1 percent over four games.\nWinslow raced in for two layups in traffic late in the second quarter, breezing past former Heat guard Shabazz Napier on one and putting his body into Magic center Nikola Vucevic for the other.\nThe Heat have said all along that Richardson was a steal at 40th overall — Pat Riley said his staff ranked him the No. 24 prospect in the draft — and he continues to validate that opinion. After leading a late rally to beat the Spurs on Monday, he looked strong at both guard positions in Orlando.\nThe Heat held out nearly everyone who figures to be part of their rotation when the real games begin. The only first- or second-string players other than Winslow to take the court were Chris Andersen and Gerald Green for 25 minutes each.\nMiami coach Erik Spoelstra declined to put Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Goran Dragic, Luol Deng and Udonis Haslem through a back-to-back, and Hassan Whiteside remained out with a strained right calf muscle.\nAmar’e Stoudemire and Josh McRoberts stayed in Miami to get treatment for knee pain and work out at the team facility. Mario Chalmers also has a knee issue and sat out against the Magic.\nMcRoberts, who tore the meniscus in his right knee in December, said last month he was fully ready. After going through all of training camp and the first two preseason games issue-free, he has been out at least the past two days.\n“This is part of the process,” Spoelstra said. “For Heat Nation, it’s not anything to be concerned about.”\nSpoelstra reiterated that he believes both players will get back to practicing this week.\nMiami bounced back from 14 down with 9:27 remaining to lead by four in the final minute, but the Magic tied it with 10.1 seconds left to force overtime. Napier, who hit a game-winner to beat the Heat last week, led Orlando with 15 points and drew a three-shot foul against Richardson with 17.1 seconds left in overtime to win it.\nAndersen finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and a blocked shot. He hit a corner 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter.\nGreen, the likely back-up for Wade, scored 10 points on 4-for-14 shooting to go with six rebounds in 25 minutes.\nTyler Johnson took a hard fall driving against Channing Frye late in the first quarter and writhed under the basket for a few minutes before he could stand.\nJohnson bruised his lower back and played through it for a few minutes before heading to the locker room. He returned to the bench with an ice bag strapped to his back and was done for the night.\nEnnis started and played 33 minutes, by far his most extended opportunity this preseason, and put together 10 points and three rebounds. Green found him on a fast break for a vicious alley-oop with 1:39 remaining that sprung the entire bench a few steps onto the court in celebration.\nThe Heat likely will have a similar personnel shortage this weekend with a game at Houston on Saturday and at Atlanta the following night. They also have their annual open scrimmage at AmericanAirlines Arena on Thursday.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/13/60/c2/Heat-Magic-Basketball.JPEG-.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:07:00.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
