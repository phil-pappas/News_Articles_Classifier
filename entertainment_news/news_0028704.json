Sheffey who resigned earlier this month.\nHe was immediately sworn in as president-elect.\nO’Connor, 59, was elected as treasurer and took office in June for the state’s bar.\nO’Connor will remain as both treasurer and president-elect until new elections in the spring.\nTraditionally, once an attorney is named president-elect he automatically becomes president the following year. However, since O’Connor was elected by the board and not the membership, he could face opposition in the next election. He could have been opposed Saturday but no attorney did so.\nHe has expressed interest in moving up the chairs to become the unified bar’s 55th president after completing terms as treasurer and president-elect.\nO’Connor is only the second Savannah attorney to fill any of the four core offices of the “big bar” since Frank “Sonny” Seiler held the president’s post in 1973.\nStatesboro attorney Gerald Edenfield was the most recent from the area when he was bar president in 2008.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Patrick", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Patrick"], "published": "2015-10-24T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:06:03.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
