See the famous faces behind the puppets as the show turns 50 Thunderbirds are Go! See the famous faces behind the puppets as the show turns 50 \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nThunderbirds has been a part of British popular culture for 50 years, and it’s still going strong. \nThe cult Supermarionation puppet series, the brainchild of husband and wife team Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, first aired on ITV on September 30, 1965. \nIt depicted the adventures of the Tracy family, aka International Rescue, who jet around the world in a variety of amazing vehicles performing daredevil rescue missions. Thunderbirds puppet Lady Penelope (ITV/Rex Features) \nEarlier this year in April, ITV premiered a reboot using a mix of CGI animation and live-action model sets. \nBut it’s the puppet series which continues to capture the imagination of viewers thanks to its action set-pieces, visual effects, cool machines and awesome gadgets. It’s almost easy to forget that Thunderbirds is a children’s TV series. \nA new DVD release has been timed to celebrate the anniversary with 32 action-packed classic episodes and a making of Thunderbirds Are Go documentary presented by Reggie Yates. \nAs Thunderbirds hits 50, take a look at the famous faces who inspired some of the key characters all those years ago. Lady Penelope The original Lady Penelope and her chauffeur Parker (Andy Butterton/PA) Promoted stories \nLady Penelope Creighton-Ward is employed by International Rescue as their London field agent. The glamorous aristocrat is an intelligent and intrepid asset to the Tracy family. She is frequently driven around in FAB 1, her modified pink Rolls Royce. Sylvia Anderson \nIn addition to giving Lady Penelope her voice, the Thunderbirds co-creator was also responsible for the puppet’s features. \nIn an interview with the Press Association, she explained how it all came about: “I didn’t start off by saying ‘Lady Penelope, that must be me’. I worked very closely with Mary Turner, a very talented lady who is still around and we still talk,” she said. Sylvia Anderson pictured with husband Gerry (PA Archive) \n“Mary and I were having difficulties getting the right face and the right look. When you’re doing a character like Parker, it’s very easy because you can make a red nose and the funny look and the Cockney accent. \n“But when you’re doing something that’s more life-like, it’s more difficult. So we worked quite hard on this and I kept saying to Mary ‘No, it’s not quite there’. I told her to work on it over the weekend. Thunderbirds puppets Lady Penelope and Parker (ITV/Rex Features) \n“She came back on Monday morning and said ‘Look – what do you think about this?’ I said ‘Oh yes, I think you’ve got it!’ What she didn’t say is that her father had said ‘Why don’t you model it on Sylvia?’ And that’s what she did. And I didn’t know that until a lot, lot later.” Parker Parker from Thunderbirds (ITV/Rex) \nFan favourite Aloysius ‘Nosey’ Parker works for Lady Penelope as her butler and chauffeur. Born in London, Parker is a reformed criminal whose safe-cracking skills come in handy from time to time. He speaks with a distinctive accent and his catchphrase is: “Yus, M’Lady”. Ben Warriss Comedians Jimmy Jewel (left) and Ben Warriss (PA Archive) \nWe can definitely see the resemblance. The inspiration for Parker’s look was this English comedian who formed a double act with his more famous cousin Jimmy Jewel (pictured wearing a cap). \nBen performed on stage for most of his life; he was still doing pantomime in his eighties. Ben died in 1993, but his connection to Thunderbirds, keeps his name alive. Scott Tracy Scott Tracy from Thunderbirds (ITV/Rex) \nIf you’ve ever fancied a puppet, you probably fancied the oldest son of International Rescue founder, Jeff Tracy. Educated at Yale and Oxford, team leader Scott is the pilot of Thunderbird 1. \nCool and calm under pressure, he usually leads the organisation from Tracy Island when his father is absent. Sean Connery Sean Connery (PA Archive) \nThe Academy Award winning actor’s career includes films ranging from Alfred Hitchcock’s Marnie to Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, The Hunt For Red October, Highlander and The Untouchables, which won him his Oscar. \nHowever, he remains best known for being the first James Bond, starring in seven Bond films between 1962 and 1983. Who can blame the Thunderbirds team for modelling one of their puppets on the world’s best known secret agent? After all, both save the world for a living. Brains Brains from Thunderbirds (Rex/ITV) \nTracy Island’s super-intelligent scientist was orphaned at the age of 12 and adopted by a Cambridge University professor before going on to work for International Rescue. \nWhenever his technical expertise is required, Brains usually accompanies the Tracy brothers in Thunderbird 2. Younger fans have adored his stutter and inventions for 50 years now. Anthony Perkins Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren (AP/PA) \nJust stick a pair of glasses on him and the resemblance will become even clearer. The American actor’s Hollywood career spanned 40 years and included the likes of Murder On The Orient Express and Friendly Persuasion, which earned him an Oscar nomination. \nHowever, playing Norman Bates in Hitchcock classic Psycho is by far his best known film. He went on to reprise the role in three more films. John Tracy John Tracy from Thunderbirds (Rex/ITV) \nInitially intended to be a main character, John became the least favourite of co-creator Gerry Anderson and his role was scaled down. \nJohn’s interest in astronomy makes him a perfect choice for life on space station Thunderbird 5 where he picks up cries for help from around the world. Adam Faith Adam Faith and wife Jackie (PA Archive) \nIt made sense to model Scott on one of the biggest movie stars at the time and it also made sense to take inspiration from the pop music world for John. \nAdam was a singer who quickly became a teen idol thanks to his clean cut good looks. After a successful singing career, he turned to acting. \nThe Thunderbirds tradition of using well known faces as the inspiration for the puppets is alive and well today. A total honour to be part of the #Thunderbirds story. Me and Lady Penelope.
