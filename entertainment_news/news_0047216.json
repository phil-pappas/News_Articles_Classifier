That, to some extent, may explain why the new season of Doctor Who (ABC, Sundays, 7.40pm) opened with the sort of thing that historically closed it: a chunky, two-part cliffhanger.And what an opener it was, full of chunk, with a side of chunk.\nAfter a year of whispering from diehard fans on the sidelines and in the shadows that the new Doctor Who – The Thick of It's Peter Capaldi – wasn't so flash, and the writing – courtesy of showrunner Steven Moffat – wasn't so flash, the ninth season of the show has truly redeemed the eighth.\nAt the same time, you have to understand the old-school Doctor Who fans are old softies, and they love a bit of nostalgia. So really, never mind the plot, you just have to throw them a bit of old Davros, and they're squealing all the way to the tip of their \"light and sound effect\" sonic screwdrivers.\nPeter Capaldi as the Doctor and Jenna Coleman as Clara in Doctor Who. Photo: David Venni/Kaia Zak \nIf you are not familiar with the Doctor Who canon, Davros is the wheelchair-bound madman who created the Daleks and seems to have hung around Doctor Who's Dalek stories like a bad smell. Unsurprising, as he does have the look of a man who hasn't seen the best side of a bathtub in centuries. And like Days of Our Lives' Stefano DiMera, he's basically un-killable.\nAdvertisement The writing on this new season of Doctor Who seems to have sharpened considerably, though it does still have to contend with Moffat's difficult-to-capture blend of comedy, horror and artifice.\nWe saw all three in spades in the opener, with the disembodied torso of Davros left on the ground, the Doctor wheeling around in Davros' wheelchair in the manner that a generation of children in the 1970s pretended to, and a beautiful, almost Shakespearean exchange between the pair which ended with a game of \"I knew all along, ha, ha, which is why I prepared for this moment!\"\nIt had the faint echo of a parody that Moffat once penned, Doctor Who and the Curse of the Fatal Death , which played to exactly the kind of plotty one-upmanship that pushes tight writing onto a metaphorical rink of slippery ice.\nAnd yet a bit of plotty one-upmanship doesn't always slow things down. In the case of The Affair (Showcase, Monday, 7.30pm) it can ramp up the speed. Chuck in some perspective tricks and the audience will be dazed, confused and in love before the first commercial break. Or they would, if it were airing on a channel with commercials.\nThe Affair began as a relatively straightforward story, about two people engaged in an extramarital romance – Noah (Dominic West) and Alison (Ruth Wilson) – and their respective spouses, Helen (Maura Tierney) and Cole (Joshua Jackson). As its narrative has gradually unfurled, it has become infinitely more complex.\nThe series plays to one gimmick of storytelling – the notion that no single perspective is the same as anyone else's, even when they're in the same room. Which works so powerfully because while that truth is somewhat debatable in many situations, the one where it is your safest bet is in the realm of human relationships.\nAlthough the series creator and writer Sarah Treem​ threw in a murder to complicate things and, perhaps, to give the story more room to play out in the longer term, the inescapable beating hearts at its core are the emotional entanglement of Noah and Alison. West and Wilson play that out with stunning brilliance.\nSuch shows often stumble and fall in their second season because they can never quite fire their second stage engines so long after take-off. But The Affair leaps into its second chapter with unexpected freshness, and some crisp moments – particularly for Tierney's Helen – which stoke the fires powerfully.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:14:18.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
