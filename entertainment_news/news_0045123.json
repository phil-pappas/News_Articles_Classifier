My first visit there is a vivid memory. I was a single mom who was having a very bad morning. I called my manager to let him know I was going to be late to work and he said, “That’s fine, but only if you bring doughnuts.” My manager was joking, but I took him seriously. The only doughnut shop in Orleans was closed so I brought a box of muffins and sweet treats from the Cottage Street Bakery. It was a huge hit with the staff and I was re-reimbursed for my efforts by the chagrined manager. Cottage Street is a little bakery that is off the beaten path in Orleans, so it’s easy to overlook. But those in the know line up for a homemade breakfast or lunch. One of my daughters had a busy week, so I treated her to lunch and we both left happier than we were when we entered. The dining room is tiny with about five tables. The room has beadboard ceilings and high shelves with antique baking tins and spice jars. A large bakery case holds all kinds of yummy treats and some beautiful cakes. Prices are reasonable. The sandwiches are all $6.29. There are eight soups each day and they sell for $4.67 a cup. Soup and a half a sandwich is $8.18. The four salads on the menu are each $6.31. There are five types of homemade bread for sandwiches including white, squash, multigrain, onion dill and croissants. My daughter ordered “turkey on the bog” on squash bread. The turkey was slices of a real roasted turkey, not deli slices. It came with a sweet-and-sour cranberry chutney, lettuce and tomato. It was fabulous. I ordered a half of a garden special on squash bread and corn chowder. The bread was incredibly moist and filled with brie cheese, pesto, hummus, baby spinach, tomato, lettuce, roasted red pepper and red onion. It was light and flavorful. The corn chowder was a broth-based soup rather than a creamy one. It had corn, diced potatoes, onions, celery and carrots cooked in vegetable stock, making it a good choice for vegans. Both sandwiches came on doily-lined trays. After we finished lunch, that beautiful dessert case beckoned. My daughter, a self-proclaimed cookie snob, said her chocolate chip cookie ($1.40) was very good. My lemon raspberry coconut bar ($2.01) was sweet and tart with a lovely buttery shortbread-style crust. Service was friendly and quick, even when a line formed. It’s the kind of place you could go to often and never get bored with the unique choices and quality ingredients. I can’t wait to go back.
