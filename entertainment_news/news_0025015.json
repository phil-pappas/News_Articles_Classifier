Levine Auction & Appraisal\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. , Oct. 21, Two original paintings by Marc Chagall – one estimated to be worth more than $1 million -- and more than 80 other luxury items and rare collectibles from regional estates will be auctioned on Thurs., Oct. 29 during the \"Fall Catalog Auction\" at J. Levine Auction & Appraisal , 10345 N. Scottsdale Rd., in Scottsdale, Arizona . The public can preview items on Wed., Oct. 28 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and again starting at 9 a.m. on Thurs., Oct. 29 before the auction begins at 11 a.m.\nJosh Levine , auctioneer and owner of J. Levine Auction & Appraisal, said the Fall Catalog Auction features a diverse selection of rare antiques, estate jewelry, historical documents and other high-end items, but the fine art will most likely steal the show.\n\"The Marc Chagall Cockerel oil on board is clearly the star of the auction. We're estimating its value to be close to $1.2 million . The same consignor also is selling a Chagall Musician oil on canvas that we believe to be worth about $300,000 ,\" Levine said.\nOther notable pieces of fine art include a René Magritte oil painting, estimated to be worth between $600,000 and $800,000 . Magritte was a 20 th century Belgian surrealist who achieved fame in his 50s for his thought-provoking paintings. \"There's quite a bit of interest in the Magritte, and it could very well eclipse the Chagall,\" Levine said.\nAn original Salvador Dali pen and ink drawing (circa 1950s) shares similar attributes to Dali's fascinating \"Face of Mae West \" and is estimated to bring in between $10,000 and $20,000 .\nA yellow 1957 Thunderbird convertible estimated at $27,500 is also part of the auction.\nAs one of the largest auction houses in the Southwest, J. Levine Auction & Appraisal reaches thousands of sophisticated bidders worldwide. Quarterly auctions, like the Fall Catalog Auction planned for Oct. 29 , have attracted more than 7,000 registered bidders in more than 60 countries.\nJ. Levine Auction & Appraisal is currently seeking consignments for its popular New Year's Day Auction on Friday, January 1, 2016 . The deadline for consignments is December 1, 2015 .\nFor information, visit www.jlevines.com or call (480) 496-2212 .\nVideo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9gXWUu0Wo\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278995\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278997\n releases/million-dollar-chagall-painting-and-notable-works-by-rene-magritte-and-salvador-dali-in-j-levines-oct-29-fall-auction-300163591.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/million-dollar-chagall-painting-and-notable-works-by-rene-magritte-and-salvador-dali-in-j-levines-oct-29-fall-auction-300163591.html", "http://www.jlevines.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA34130&Transmission_Id=201510210937PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA34130&DateId=20151021", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278997", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278995", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151020/278995", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9gXWUu0Wo", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151020/278997", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9gXWUu0Wo?version=3"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:38:36.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
