They are one of the few gospel acts to successfully transition to secular music and become hit-makers in multiple genres. \n\"It's always been family,\" Bonsall said during the ceremony. \"Family has been what's most important. We've tried to run our group that way, as a family.\" \nThe Browns, a sibling trio made up of Jim Ed Brown and his sisters Maxine and Bonnie, established themselves as smooth harmony singers in the 1950s and '60s with songs like \"The Old Lamplighter\" and \"Scarlet Ribbons (for Her Hair.)\" When Maxine and Bonnie left the business to raise their children, Jim Ed Brown continued on as a popular solo artist who had a successful run as a radio and television host as well. \nJim Ed Brown was inducted into the hall of fame at his bedside a few days before his death in June from cancer, and his sister, Bonnie, announced earlier this month that she has also diagnosed with cancer. \nBentley, who performed Jim Ed Brown's \"Pop A Top,\" said Brown was like a father figure at the Grand Ole Opry when Bentley first started performing there. \n\"He's probably up there looking down on us and will probably be in the room tonight when we're singing, and I'll be nervous,\" Bentley said before the ceremony. \nFew musicians have had a career like Martin, a guitar and fiddle player who performed with musical legends like Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline and Willie Nelson. He could play just about any style, from acoustic, rockabilly, rock 'n' roll or twangy country. \nOne famous story about Martin was how he created his signature guitar lick on Marty Robbins' hit, \"Don't Worry.\" A preamp in the studio mixing board malfunctioned, which gave his solo guitar part a fuzzed-out sound that became so popular that even Keith Richards replicated it for the Rolling Stones. \nMartin died in 2001. Singer Brenda Lee presented the medallion to his son, Joshua Martin. \n__", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:07:47.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
