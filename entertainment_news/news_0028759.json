I think a lot of this was because he was so heartbroken. He really slid further down when he realised he couldn't get her back. He's been in a down place for a while.'' \nThe 35-year-old athlete allegedly started using drugs after the SUV he was travelling in, while en route to his cousin's funeral in 2011, killed a 15-year-old pedestrian. \nA friend said: ''He's said he never fully recovered from that and has been living with the sadness ever since. Things kept getting worse and worse, he was numbing the pain with whatever he could find.'' \nWhile Khloé has vowed to remain by Lamar's side and has taken a break from her romance with James Harden, it would take a lot for her to consider giving their marriage another chance. \nThe insider told Us Weekly magazine: ''Keep in mind, Lamar was found in a brothel. He has been sober before and has fallen off the wagon. That's not something she's willing to endure again.''
