Mulligan backed the protest. The film co-stars Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff who also supported the activists.

The film was the first commercial movie to be allowed to film in the Houses of Parliament. Helen Pankhurst, the great grand-daughter of suffragette Emmeline, and Laura Pankhurst - Emmeline's great great grand-daughter also attended the gala screening.
