ArtWorks for Healing offers an opportunity for AWBW’s supporters to collect art pieces by established Los Angeles artists, all while sharing their commitment to helping the organization’s healing art programs for domestic violence and trauma survivors. Actress and comedian Beth Littleford (“The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and Comedy Central’s “The Beth Littleford Interview Specials”) will lead guests through a variety of entertainment and auction activities as guest Emcee and Live Auctioneer! Actress and Comedian Beth Littleford \nVIP ticket holders and sponsors will have the honor of watching a dramatic performance as artist Chaz Guest paints a live portrait of a distinguished jazz quartet during the cocktail reception from 6-7pm. Chaz is known for painting celebrities from all over the world including President Barack Obama, Stevie Wonder, and Prima Ballerina Misty Copeland. The jazz quartet, known as “The West Side Jazz Surgeons”, is a group of international, top-tier, iconic musicians: Quentin Dennard is a well-known Motown drummer, guitarist David Marcus played at the Village Vanguard, Bobby Pierce played with legendary guitarist Pat Martino, and South African bassist, Trevor Gordon played with a variety of esteemed musicians throughout his career. Artist Chaz Guest \nThe evening features a silent auction of art pieces in a wide range of medium curated by a prestigious group of advocates including Amanda Quinn Olivar, Patricia Correia, Eva Chimento, and Garboushian Gallery. Artists have also been invited to create original Touchstones that share a united and creative journey of art transforming trauma, much like the touchstones survivors in our programs use as talismans of healing. For an opportunity to own these specially curated works by Patssi Valdez, Ed Rauscha, Danielle Eubank, and more, tickets may be purchased HERE – the artwork is available for preview prior to the event! \nChaz Guest is an American artist who creates paintings, drawings and sculptures that have reached an ever-growing list of esteemed private and public collectors, including the President of the United States, Barack H. Obama. \nSince 1991, A Window Between Worlds has centered their work in the field of domestic violence, providing art interventions for women and their children. Last year AWBW expanded their mission and scope of work to meet the rising demand for their programs across systems of care serving trauma survivors and movements to end violence. Event proceeds launch AWBW into its 25th anniversary year, and ensure their expansion to serve new populations is both sustainable and impactful.
