As the media and entertainment industry moves towards Ultra-HD, 4K/8K video-shooting is becoming the standard format. At the same time, a fast and reliable storage solution has become just as important as a large capacity.\nWith the 3 and 6TB high-capacity enterprise line SSDs, Fixstars caught the eyes of media and entertainment professionals and showed potential as an ideal partner for video-shooting devices. Among these is ATOMOS, a leading player in camera-mounted recorders, which has officially recognized Fixstars as a certified storage partner. In dedication to this collaboration, Fixstars' IRIS-DRIVE was selected as a recommended drive for ATOMOS' \"SHOGUN\" and \"NINJA ASSASSIN\" series. This is the largest capacity SSD available on video recorders.\nFixstars looks forward to more upcoming collaborations in media and entertainment to help more video-shooting enthusiasts with reliable and high-performance storage.\nSMPTE 2015 will be held at:\nLoews Hollywood Hotel\n1755 North Highland Avenue\nHollywood, CA 90028\nContact:\nShien Zhu\n6502820598\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151022/279554\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151022/279555\n releases/come-meet-fixstars-in-hollywood-300164641.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH35625&Transmission_Id=201510220939PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH35625&DateId=20151022", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/come-meet-fixstars-in-hollywood-300164641.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151022/279555", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151022/279554", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151022/279554", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151022/279555"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:30:01.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
