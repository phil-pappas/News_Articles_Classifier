Here are nine facts about the starlet. \nRimi Sen made her debut with Hungama (2003) as the object of affection of both Akshaye Khanna and Aftab Shivdasani. \nIn the same year, she starred in Baghban, in which she played Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini’s granddaughter. \nRimi went on to star with heroes like Akshay Kumar and John Abraham and acted in a string of hero-oriented hits like Garam Masala, Dhoom 2, Phir Hera Pheri and Golmaal. But the film’s successes did not benefit her much. \nShe was last appreciated in a comic cameo in Thank You (2010) in which she matched with wits with Irrfan Khan.Rimi played Salman Khan’s heroine in Kyon Ki (2005). He is now hosting ‘Bigg Boss’ on which she is a contestant. She said, “He is very simple by heart. If I face any problem, I can always take his help. He is the only person whom I can trust.” \nShe says she joined Bigg Boss because of the chance to “understand different kind of human beings.” She admitted that “I don’t have many friends in my life; my PR is also not happening. I prefer to stay alone at home.” \nThe actress said, “I cannot fight with someone and I can’t answer someone back. If I don’t like a person and if I feel that person is not right for me then I just avoid that person.” \nRimi claims that “I was never much interested in acting. Since childhood my financial condition was not that good so I started doing ads and music videos and then I got films by accident. I prefer wearing simple clothes rather than jazzy clothes. The glamour industry never appealed to me, it was only because of money. But I always try to do something creative in life, like writing or directing. I am more comfortable behind the camera.” \nRimi wants to venture into direction next year and she said, “I am using Bigg Boss as my base, a warm-up session for me to help me learn how to handle a lot of people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:43:52.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
