The maximum individual payout for each member of this group will be $1,000.\nMost of the money Sony is dishing out will go to lawyers, however. \"SPE will pay any attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded by the Court, not to exceed $3,490,000 separately from the relief for the Settlement Class Members, and thus the attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses will not reduce the relief for the Settlement Class,\" the plaintiff's lawyers wrote in a a memorandum of points filed in mid-October and obtained by Deadline. \nIn November of last year, Sony's Internet security systems were hacked, exposing the personal information of about 3,000 current and former employees, executive correspondence and project budgets.
