Chefs and mixologists are celebrities here, enjoy cult followings and offer a host of spots to nosh, chat and play in.\nSure, we have plenty of bars and even a lounge and nightclub or two, but the Hub’s sophisticated set prefers to gather for dinner and stay for drinks. Ideally, they want a fun place to do both — and today’s creative restaurateurs step up to the plate. Those hot spots don’t generate buzz for nothing.\nWe asked a quintet of out-and-about Bostonians for their favorites:\nSCOTT KEARNAN, editor, Zagat Boston\nHis pick: “Hojoko is a playful Japanese tavern from the same people behind swank sushi destination O Ya. It’s inside the new rock ’n’ roll themed Verb Hotel, but its name nods to the Howard Johnson hotel that used to stand there, which housed the Tiki Hideaway, a kitschy bar that used to draw a late-night industry crowd. The tattooed chefs will definitely be gravitating to Hojoko, which has all the funky tricks — quirky and nostalgic decor, a ‘Pac-Man’ arcade game, super creative cocktails — to set the stage for awesome food.”\nMust-try dish: “I’m still working my way through the menu, but so far I’m especially loving the okonomiyaki with smoky bacon, shiitake, yam, truffle Kewpie and Hojoko’s uber-flavorful ‘honkytonky sauce.’ Also, it may not be your first choice at a creative Japanese joint, but don’t snooze on the burger. It’s insanely good. Insanely.”\nMust-try drink: “I’m especially loving the Budokan cocktail, a mix of rum, madeira and shittake mushroom absinthe. Be careful, it’s a sipper. I learned the hard way.”\nHojoko, 1271 Boylston St. ; hojoko boston.com\nCAROLINE HUMPHREY, Boston attorney\nHer pick: “Clio may be almost two decades old but it still houses two of the swankiest and most dynamic scenes in Boston. If you’re looking for a more underground vibe, and can wait it out until midnight, head downstairs to Uni for midnight ramen on Friday or Saturday nights. This special late-night treat is the best-kept secret where the posh go to avoid the pretentious.”\nMust-try dish: “You can’t go wrong upstairs with either tasting menu, as long as you get the foie gras with Marsala poached pear, Yuzu Kosho and smoked vanilla. Downstairs, the short rib and kimchi ramen and sake will finish any great night off.”\nMust-try drink: “I like the French 75 but the foie pairs nicely with sherry.”\nEliot Hotel, 370A Common­wealth Avenue ; cliorestaurant.com\nSUHAIL KWATRA, wardrobe stylist at Saks Fifth Avenue\nHis pick: “I am loving Doretta Taverna . Michael Schlow always delivers. The location is central and cozy and it’s near all the clubs and lounges, so it’s a great spot to go to for dinner or drinks prior to going out. The bar scene is hopping, and the music is great. It’s also a very diverse crowd, which is always nice to see for a change.”\nMust-try dish: “The Greek food is healthy and very light and makes for the perfect dinner spot before going out dancing. My fave dish would be the branzino and appetizer, the zucchini chips.”\nMust-try drink: “I have this fabulous Mediterranean white wine. 2012 Douloufakis Dafnios Liatiko, Crete. It’s amazing.”\nDoretta Taverna, 79 Park Plaza ; dorettaboston.com\nNATASHA MOUSTACHE, photographer\nHer pick: “I’m in love with Yvonne’s , and not just because Chris Jamison managed to wrangle together some of the finest bar staff Boston has to offer. … My first time there, I had dinner at 7 p.m. and found myself leaving at 2 a.m. Something happened around 10 when the lights dimmed and it became less supper and more club.”\nMust-try dish: “The Matambre! Meat stuffed with cheese and more meat?? What’s not to love? Tender flank steak stuffed with provolone and salami surrounded by creamy, parmesan polenta ... it’s delicious! Pro-tip: Save room for dessert. Pastry chef Kate\nHolowchik is doing wonders with macaroon sandwiches and negroni drumsticks.”\nMust-try drink: “Cocktail-wise, the large-format options read like scorpion bowls’ tastier, white-gloved cousins; perfect for a pregame share with friends.”\nYvonne’s, 2 Winter Place ; yvonnesboston.com\nMy picks:\nCommittee, 50 Northern Ave.; committeeboston.com\nPeople were skeptical when the folks behind a local nightclub (Bijou) and a casual eatery (Cafeteria) wanted to get serious about food. But their Mediterranean small plates and inspired cocktails proved ’em wrong. Share warm or cold mezze like tzatziki or artichoke moussaka with your best pals inside the uber cool space decorated in part with reclaimed wood from the old Anthony’s Pier 4. Then, sip some of their many custom libations and stay for the late-night weekend party.\nOutlook Kitchen and Bar at the Envoy Hotel, 70 Sleeper St.; theenvoyhotel.com\nWhen this Seaport hotel opened earlier this year, its trendy outdoor bar Lookout quickly became a nightlife go-to for locals. Last month, chef David Verdo (Market, Miel, Asana, Chopps) opened Outlook Kitchen and Bar, serving incredible, globally inspired small plates and some of the best cocktails in Boston (thank you, Bruno Marini). The 28-seat bar has a power outlet at each seat, making it easy to post tipsy pics on Instagram all night long.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:17:37.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
