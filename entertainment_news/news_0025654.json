By Rashmi Mishra on October 5, 2015 at 9:03 PM Comments What happens when two superstars of their respective fields engage in a conversation on a public social media platform? Pure magic is guaranteed. Something of similar sort happened when Brazilian novelist and self-proclaimed Shah Rukh Khan fan, Paulo Coelho thanked the Bollywood superstar for sending lovely collection of SRK movies. Shahrukh being a social media savvy took no time in replying Coelho making their Facebook conversation an interesting read. Also Read: Shah Rukh Khan’s My Name is Khan best film: Paul Coelho . We all had come to know about the great admiration 68-year-old, Paulo Coelho has for Shah Rukh Khan when he had praised King Khan’s 2008 movie My Name is Khan earlier the year. He had congratulated both Shah Rukh and Karan Johar on making such a wonderful movie. Paulo had gone on to say that ‘My Name Is Khan’ was the “best film that he has watched this year”. Considering the interest Paulo showed towards SRK movies, the 49-year-old actor sent him a huge collection of his movies DVDs for the bestselling author to choose from. In his Facebook post, Paulo Coelho wrote, “Thank you for this wonderful Monday morning gift, Shah Rukh Khan! Now I have to decide where to start. Sending you a special editions of some of of my books”. Shah Rukh Khan helped Paulo with this reply, “Paulo Coelho, if feeling Buddhism: Asoka. Sporty: Chak De, Country proud: Swades. Mad Fun: Om Shanti Om. Guys, please suggest which one he should watch first…” No wonder Shah Rukh Khan is the most charming of all. \n  9:03 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:20:07.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
