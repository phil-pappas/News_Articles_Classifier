Their annual financial statement showed the boyband achieved a turnover of £73.7m last year, or £6.15m a month.\nThe report revealed that the singers' company, 1d Media Limited, spent more than £28m in administrative expenses.\nThis is likely to have gone towards transporting them around the world for their tour and providing security.\nAnd while Zayn Malik may have left the band in March, he is still entitled to a chunk of the total, which stands at around £35m after tax.\nThat amount is almost 10 times the £4.8m they took home in 2013.\nMalik has now signed a solo deal\nThe four remaining members - Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson - are celebrating another success: the release of their new single, Perfect.\nThe single has already rocketed to the top of iTunes and fans have been sharing their excitement on social media.\nThe hash tag 'It'sPerfectDay' trended worldwide within minutes of the song's release.\nOne Direction are taking a short break from recording and performing next year after working non-stop since their appearance on The X Factor in 2010.\nTheir fifth album is due for release on 13 November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:38:26.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
