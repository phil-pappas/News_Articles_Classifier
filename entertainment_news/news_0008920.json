(Photo: TRIBUNE FILE PHOTO) AUTUMN EVENING OF WINE AND WHISKEY Saturday, Oct. 17 from 6 to 9 p.m. Meadow Lark Country Club 1 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGear up your palate for an evening of wine, whiskey, beer and food for a pair of good causes at the 6th Annual Autumn Evening of Wine and Whiskey on Oct. 17. \nFrom 6 to 9 p.m., lovers of luscious libations can sip to their hearts’ content knowing all their dollars are going toward local swimmers and My Student in Need. \nTickets for the event, which takes place at the Meadow Lark Country Club, are $50 each or $85 for a couple and include tastings, food, entertainment, giveaways and a complimentary souvenir wine glass. \nAll of the whiskey, bourbon and beer selections come from Montana producers such as the Mighty Mo Brewery, and many of the wines up for sampling are not yet available in local stores. \n“The big presentation is showcasing some wines to taste and trying stuff out that you’ve never tried before,” said event organizer Jane MacDonald. \nMacDonald coaches 9 to 12 year olds for the Waves Swim Team, which includes swimmers through high school age who compete statewide. Funds received by the Waves go toward equipment and travel expenses. \nFood for the evening includes a bruschetta bar where guests can choose from toppings to put on crostini. There are also a variety of spreads and finger foods. \n“It’s a lot of good food in a beautiful venue,” MacDonald said. \nJeff Carroll and DJ Coyote provide music, and the first 50 people through the door get a mystery bag of goodies. \nNon-drinkers and people under 21 are encouraged to attend, and there will be non-alcoholic beverages for those folks. \nThe event also features a silent auction with an American Girl doll, lots of wine baskets, art items, and quilts and a My Student in Need Basket with gift cards, headphones and a Ninja food processor. \nAdults can purchase a shot at the Wall of Wine, where a blind draw can net them a fancy wine. \nMacDonald said, “We’ve done it every year and it’s been really popular.” \nPurchase tickets at the Peak 727-7325, ext. 207 or online at www.autumneveningforwine.com . Buying them at the door is OK, too, and the price is the same.
