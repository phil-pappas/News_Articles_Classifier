Video courtesy Four Corners, ABC\nPT0M38S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44srj 620 349 October 20, 2015 - 6:10AM Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Michael Lawler admits he benefited from HSU Jackson's partner should have taken his own advice Just when you thought Four Corners'  explosive investigation into the forbidden love between a union boss and a Fair Work Commission official couldn't get more bizarre, someone dropped the c-bomb. \nIt was not your run-of-the mill profanity, and it was not uttered by just anyone. \nBesotted couple: Michael Lawler and Kathy Jackson. Photo: Supplied \nThe term \"c--t-struck\" left the lips of the embattled Vice President of the Fair Work Commission Michael Lawler -  a man on a $430,000 taxpayer-funded salary.\nAdvertisement Lawler used the phrase to describe how he feared he would be portrayed when his relationship with former head of the Health Services Union, Jackson, was made public. Jackson was found guilty in a civil case that ended in August of misusing her position as head of the union to fraudulently gain financial advantage and was ordered to pay about $1.4 million.\n\"I'll be characterised as that scumbag, crook, fraudster, and, at the very best, somebody who's been bewitched by an evil harridan, namely Kathy [Jackson],\" Lawler told ABC journalist Caro Meldrum-Hanna.\n\"That I'm c-nt-struck and that I have been utterly taken in by somebody who's a serious crook,\" he said.\nThough the c-word is common gutter parlance, the -struck suffix is lesser known. \n\"C--t-struck: to be in a state of having an irrational and strong emotional and physical attraction to a woman,\" according to Urban Dictionary.\nUnlike the 'Did he? Didn't he?' drama that followed cabinet Minister Christopher Pyne's possible c-word slip during parliamentary Question Time in 2014, there was no doubt about this.\nThat's because ABC didn't bleep out the profanity. \nThe closed-caption archivists at Tveeder didn't miss it either:\nTveeder captioning of ABC's Four Corners program on Monday night. Photo: Tveeder \nIt was the most shocking moment 40 minutes into a Four Corners  that had already distinguished itself as one of the most outrageous investigations in the program's recent memory.\nThe extensive confessional interviews with Lawler and Jackson - in which they repeatedly called each other \"beloved\" - were interspersed with Lawler's purportedly candid video diaries, secretly taped phone calls involving Lawler performing what appeared to be a poorly executed yoga pose and supplied video and holiday snaps from overseas trips courtesy of HSU union coffers. \nAll punctuated by the jarring violin notes of a Hitchcock thriller.\nFair Work VP Lawler's demo re how to record your boss has some fans #4Corners @abcnews pic.twitter.com/WbwOjat9nB \n— Steve Knott (@steveknottamma) October 19, 2015 The offensive term itself, preceded by the phrase \"evil harridan\" and finished off with a \"bullshit\" for good measure, marked the zenith of the program's social media reaction. \nAnd the liberal proliferation of the offending term seemed to annoy grammar pedants more than the liberal proliferation of union funding by the offenders.\nWarning: the content below contains language that some readers may find offensive.  \nI don't have a problem with the expression 'cuntstruck' - but dropped by a judicial officer on national TV? Nup. He's lost it.\n— therese piper (@treespiepurr) October 19, 2015 #4Corners #turc Lawler denies being cunt-struck, an expression I've not heard on TV before. I'm so sheltered.\n— Joan Evatt (@Boeufblogginon) October 19, 2015 Our ABC just gave the world the word, \"cuntstruck\"… what a time to be alive @4corners \n— BuzzFeedOz Politics (@BuzzFeedOzPol) October 19, 2015 Note to Australia's columnists: \"cunt-struck\" needs a hyphen.
