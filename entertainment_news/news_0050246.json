Ronnie Killen named Restaurateur of the Year 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Houston's restaurant and bar community has always been something of a mutual support group. Local chefs and bartenders are tight and often act as their own best cheerleaders.\nNowhere was that more evident than at the 2015 Houston Culinary Awards presented by My Table magazine Sunday night at the Houstonian. The 19th annual awards ceremony that recognizes the city's top chefs and restaurants brought out some of Houston's brightest culinary stars. And they all cheered for each other as the 10 Houston Culinary Awards were handed out.\nOne of biggest ovations came for Ronnie Killen who was named Restaurateur of the Year for his work at his white tablecloth Killen's Steakhouse and his game-changing Killen's Barbecue , both in Pearland; and for Ryan Pera who was cited as Chef of the Year for Coltivare and Revival Market . The award for Best New Restaurant was given to Holley's Seafood Restaurant & Oyster Bar led by chef Mark Holley. And Pastry Chef of the Year went to Rebecca Masson who this year realized her dream of opening her first brick and mortar store, Fluff Bake Bar .\nMidtown's Weights + Measures took home two of the top awards: Outstanding Bar Service and Best Interior Design. It also was named Favorite Late Night Spot in the Houston Foodie Star Awards, a separate round of awards voted on by My Table readers.\nThe evening also included a tribute to Donna and Tony Vallone who were presented with the Legends of Houston Restaurant Award, recognizing legendary restaurateurs and food professionals in Houston.\n\"It's an honor for us. It's thrilling. It feels like yesterday that I was a 20-year-old kid getting started,\" said Tony Vallone, who this year marked his 50th year in the restaurant business in Houston.\nHe praised the city's culinary community saying \"we are a great food city -- we can hold ourselves with anything else in the country.\"\nHe drew laughs we he recounted his response to a customer who asked when he was going to retire from overseeing his restaurants including the luxurious Tony's . Not anytime soon, Vallone said: \"I hope they carry me out with a fish in one hand and pasta in the other.\"\nThe evening was hosted by Teresa Byrne-Dodge, founder of My Table magazine. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the Grant Gordon Foundation.\nThe 2015 Houston Culinary Award winners:\nRestaurateur of the Year: Ronnie Killen (Killen's Steakhouse, Killen's Barbecue)\nChef of the Year: Ryan Pera (Coltivare, Revival Market)\nUp-and-Coming Chef of the Year : Terrence Gallivan and Seth Siegel-Gardner ( The Pass & Provisions )\nOutstanding Wine Service : Underbelly\nPastry Chef of the Year: Rebecca Masson (Fluff Bake Bar)\nOutstanding Bar Service: Weights + Measures\nService Person of the Year: Steven McDonald ( Pappas Bros. )\nHouston Classic (restaurant in business for 10 years or longer): Backstreet Caf√©\nBest Interior Design: Weights + Measures\nBest New Restaurant: Holley's Seafood Restaurant & Oyster Bar\nHouston Foodie Star Awards winners:\nFavorite Wine Seller: Richard's Liquors and Fine Wines\nFavorite Sweets/Ice Cream: Cloud 10 Creamery\nFavorite Supermarket: Sprouts Farmers Market\nFavorite Pub or Bar: Julep\nFavorite Outdoor Dining : The Grove\nFavorite Mom & Pop Ethnic: Arnaldo Richards' Picos\nFavorite Late Night Spot: Weights + Measures\nFavorite Food Truck/Cart: Tacos Tierra Caliente\nFavorite Farmers Market Vendor: Blue Heron Farm , Waller\nFavorite Coffeehouse: Common Bond\nFavorite Burger: Pappas Burger\nFavorite Breakfast: La Guadalupana\nFavorite Bartender: Terry Williams ( Anvil Bar and Refuge )\nFavorite Barbecue: Jackson Street BBQ\nFavorite Bakery: Petite Sweets", "external_links": ["http://www.anvilhouston.com/", "http://www.blueherontexas.com/", "http://weights-measures.com/", "http://www.thegrovehouston.com/", "http://pappasburger.com/home/", "http://www.petitesweetshouston.com/", "https://www.sprouts.com/", "http://wearecommonbond.com/", "http://holleyshouston.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Guadalupana-Cafe-and-Bakery/181376368562219", "http://backstreetcafe.net/", "http://www.julephouston.com/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/02/8740995/3/920x920.jpg", "http://coltivarehouston.com/", "http://www.killenssteakhouse.com/", "http://jacksonstbbqhouston.com/", "http://www.picos.net/", "http://fluffbakebar.com/", "http://my-table.com/sidedish/winners-2015-houston-culinary-awards/?utm_source=My+Table+magazine%27s+SideDish+newsletter&utm_campaign=5eafbe92d1-SideDish_10_4_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_53700635fc-5eafbe92d1-108007130&mc_cid=5eafbe92d1&mc_eid=a8a52b1594", "http://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/article/Tony-s-celebrates-five-decades-6177971.php", "http://passandprovisions.com/", "http://revivalmarket.com/", "http://www.richardsliquors.com/", "http://tonyshouston.com/", "http://www.pappas.com/home/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tacos-Tierra-Caliente/231735656843139?sk=wall", "http://www.cloud10creamery.com/", "http://www.underbellyhouston.com/", "http://www.killensbarbecue.com/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/02/8740995/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:20:08.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
