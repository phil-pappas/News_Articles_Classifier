They have emblems of military service branches.\nApollo said the university \"immediately discontinued the use of challenge coins\" in July after the Defense Department raised objections. And Apollo said it has discussed the issue of approval for events at military bases with the Defense Department and noted all previous events had been approved by base officials.\nMilitary benefits are an important source of revenue to for-profit colleges, which historically have struggled to comply with a federal student-aid regulation known as the 90/10 rule. The rule -- which requires for-profit schools to derive at least 10 percent of revenue from non-federal sources -- is a cost and quality-control measure. It ensures that schools do not operate solely on federal financial aid.\nBut military benefits such as the Defense Department's tuition-assistance program and the GI Bill are not counted as federal funding.\nFederal lawmakers and student advocates argue that policy has incentivized for-profit colleges to target active-duty military and veterans to in order to comply with the rule.\nA 2012 Senate report found that for-profit colleges took in half of the $563 million in military tuition assistance given out in the prior year.\nThe GI Bill, which pays tuition and housing for military veterans, is a much larger pool of money.\nA Los Angeles Times analysis of federal data from 2009 to 2014 found that for-profit colleges took in about 40 percent of the $8.2 billion given out under the latest version of the GI Bill.\nThe Apollo Group was by far the largest recipient of GI Bill funding, taking in more than $1.2 billion since 2009.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735375", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735375&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735375&h=Pentagon+bars+University+of+Phoenix+from+adding+new+military+students"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:16:12.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
