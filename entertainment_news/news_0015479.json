William Kliefoth, after she finished her training.\nBack | Next Photo provided by Nancy McAllister\nBy Mary Carr Mayle I t’s been called the golden age of flying — the decades between 1950 and 1980 when jet airplanes represented more than just a way to get from one faraway place to another. Mostly reserved for the well-heeled in those early days, international airline flight was glamorous and exciting, the flight itself as much a part of the experience as the destination.\nNo airline epitomized the “jet-setter” experience more than Pan American World Airways, the first to fly both the Atlantic and Pacific nonstop and the first to offer round-the-world flights.\nIt was the airline of choice for the rich and famous — everyone from movie stars to royalty — and its flight crews enjoyed unmatched prestige around the world.\nPan Am quit flying in 1991, but its mystique lives on, most recently as a fictional television series on the lives of Pan Am pilots and stewardesses who were considered the “cream of the crop” in commercial aviation.\nAtlanta-area native Mary Stimmel joined the airline’s stewardess corps as she was wrapping up her communications degree at the University of Georgia and flew with the airline from 1961 to 1964.\nNow living with her husband Carl in McIntosh County, she has been in Savannah for the last four days, where some 750 women — and some men — have gathered at the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort for the annual meeting of World Wings International, the organization of former Pan Am flight attendants.\n“When I joined Pan Am, there were few opportunities open to women,” she said. “We were told we could be nurses, secretaries or teachers — or we could get married and raise children. I was considered ‘out there’ studying communications.”\nOn a whim, Stimmel went with a friend to Atlanta in late 1960 to interview with the airline.\n“It was the end of the term, I didn’t have a final that day and I thought ‘why not?’ I was looking for a break and thought it would be fun,” she said last week.\nIt ended up changing her life.\nA decade later, Becky Sprecher was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the midst of a blossoming women’s movement.\n“I started college in 1968, totally expecting to join a sorority, get pinned, engaged and married. Then I went to my first anti-war rally,” the Beaufort resident said, laughing.\nIt was a time, Sprecher said, when women were beginning to imagine that they could do different things. After graduation, she decided to apply to Pan Am as an interim step before beginning her career.\n“I wanted adventure and I wanted to see the world,” she said. “I had no idea the lasting and profound influence that decision would have on my life.”\nSavannahian Joan Carroll flew for Pan Am from 1958 to 1963.\n“I had my eye on Pan Am right out of college,” she said. “In fact, I flew for TWA for a year until Pan Am had an opening.”\nBecoming a Pan Am stewardess was a natural decision for Nancy McAllister, whose father was a pilot for the airlines.\n“I’ve always joked that my blood was Pan Am blue,” the Atlanta native said, laughing. “My dad got the job with the airline, my parents celebrated and nine months later I was born.”\nElise Nore, who traveled from her native Oslo, Norway, for this week’s gathering, came to the airline from a different perspective.\n“Pan Am came to Oslo to recruit in the late ’60s,” she said. “I think they really liked the fact that most of us spoke three languages.”\nNore, an athlete, was set to go to college for track and field and swimming when friends urged her to interview. She had never heard of Pan Am.\n“In 1969, 14 of us flew from Oslo to Miami to begin our training,” she said. “None of us had ever flown before.”\nIn 1970, she was on the first commercial 747 flight, a Pan Am trip from New York to London.\nThe adventure — and education — of a lifetime\nBecoming a Pan Am stewardess was no easy feat. The requirements were stiff, the training vigorous. Candidates were selected on appearance, personality and smarts. A second language was mandatory.\n“I was once told that, out of every 50,000 interviewed, 500 were chosen,” McAllister said, adding that she didn’t get any special treatment because her father was a Pan Am pilot.\nTraining was intense and all-encompassing, with the No. 1 emphasis on safety.\nBecause almost every flight was over water — Pan Am did not offer domestic flights — crews had to be strong swimmers.\n“The training was incredible,” Stimmel said. “We were taught everything from how to deliver a baby to how to whip up a six-course gourmet French meal at 30,000 feet. We were schooled in fine wines and cultural customs.”\nThey were also trained in the fine arts of discretion and crisis management.\nCarroll recalled a flight in which a well-known Asian head of state was in first class, arguing loudly with his mistress.\n“I was able to get them calmed down for a while, but then things started getting heated again just as I was serving their meal,” she said. “Suddenly, the mistress grabbed her fork and stabbed him in the back of his hand. He’s screaming, she’s screaming and I’m gingerly pulling the fork out, compressing the wound until we could get it bandaged.”\nSprecher recalled an Asian flight in which a well-known boxer was in first class with his mistress.\n“Unbeknownst to him, his wife had caught wind of the affair and had purchased a ticket in coach,” she said. “When she realized they were in first class, she made quite a scene, demanding to be let up to where he was. It was tricky.\n“But we handled it.”\nGlamorous, fun and scary\n“We were also taught not to gush over celebrities,” Sprecher said. “Our job was to make sure everything was running smoothly and everyone was happy, but to basically be part of the furniture.\nSometimes, however, it just didn’t work out that way.\nStimmel recalled the time very early in her career when she walked down the aisle in first class and, looking down, saw Jimmy Stewart and his wife.\n“I was so nervous I kept dropping the cutlery,” she said. “I could barely apologize, I was so tongue-tied, but they were very nice about it.”\nCarroll had a similar experience.\n“I was working in the galley when the girls in first class kept coming back and telling me ‘Joanie, Joanie, you have to come see this beautiful man.’ I told them I was busy, but they kept coming back and insisting so, when I was able to take a break, I went up to first class, but I didn’t see anyone fitting their description,” she said. “I made myself a meal and sat down in the jump seat at the back of First Class to eat.\n“That’s when this tall, incredibly handsome man came out of the restroom, smiled down at me and said, ‘Are you just now getting to eat young lady?’\n“My fork was in midair and I was so flustered I ended up stabbing the seat over my shoulder. Of course, my fellow crew hadn’t even come close to doing Rock Hudson justice!”\nBut for all the glamour and fun, there were moments of sheer terror.\n“We were flying from Dusseldorf to New York by way of Amsterdam,” Stimmel said. It was gray and foggy when we made our descent into Amsterdam. Suddenly, through the fog was a Dutch military cargo jet that wasn’t supposed to be there — right in our flight path.\n“Our pilots pulled up with what I’ve always thought was superhuman strength to avoid the collision, putting us into a steep climb. Then, when they could pull no more, we plunged into a rapid descent before finally leveling off. I was thrown to the floor and remember thinking ‘I’m only 23, I’m not ready to die.’\n“But I was one of the lucky ones. We had dozens of serious injuries, including one stewardess who broke her back.”\nThe experience shook her up so much, Stimmel said, that she seriously considered quitting.\n“But I knew if I did, I’d never get on a plane again,” she said. “And I had way too many adventures ahead of me for that.”\nCarroll also had a harrowing tale to tell.\n“We were flying a charter from Frankfort with U.S. military personnel on board, having a wonderful time, when the first engine went out,” she said. “Just a few minutes later, the second engine went out. It suddenly got very quiet, and all I could hear was the click of seat belts being fastened.\n“About that time, we hit some turbulence and the third engine started making noises. The centrifugal force was so strong, I couldn’t stand up. Then, slowly, the first two engines sputtered back to life and we were fine.”\nCarroll said the experience was scary, but it never occurred to her to quit.\nSprecher, an historian and author, is fluent in all things Pan Am. It’s that adventurous spirit — “not a quitter in the bunch” — that she believes distinguishes the women who flew for the storied airline.\n“If I had to describe this group in three words, it would be smarts, class and sass,” she said. “We were multicultural long before it was cool. We were, in a sense, citizens of the world. And we shared a camaraderie few others could understand.”\n‘Shoehorned into history’\nWhile the trans-Atlantic flights were glamorous, the trans-Pacific flights were decidedly more political and mysterious, according to Sprecher, who was based in Honolulu.\n“The flights out of New York were filled with celebrities and socialites, but our flights into Asia were more likely to have ‘spooks’ and special agents, being inserted into foreign countries,” she said.\nThen there was the war in Vietnam.\nSprecher first flew into Saigon when the troop draw-down was beginning.\n“We were flying charter after charter of troops that seemed so beaten down, it was heartbreaking,” she said.\nShortly after, she was flying Pan Am charters bringing refugees out of Guam, many of them babies.\n“In the winter of 1975, in the wake of Nixon’s resignation, our “baby lift” flights were bringing the orphans out,” she said “It was not unusual to have a flight with 100 babies on board, all coming to be adopted.”\nEven as the horrors of war were all around, Sprecher said she was impressed with the ability of Americans “to make something good out of something awful.”\n“We actually had an anonymous American donor who chartered a 747 for ‘Operation Baby Flight.’ We didn’t realize it at the time, but we were being shoehorned into history.”\nAnother less than glamorous aspect of international flying in those days was the always present spectre of hijacking.\n“The first Pan Am 747 to be hijacked was in September of 1970, Nore said. “It was a real eye-opener for all of us.”\nKnown as the Dawson’s Field Hijackings, the incident involved five commercial jets taken over by The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Three of the planes were forced to land at a remote airstrip in Jordan known as Dawson’s Field. Pan Am flight 93 was too large to land at the airstrip and was diverted first to Beirut, then Cairo.\n“The captain credited the crew with keeping the passengers calm and getting them all off the plane safely,” McAllister said. “He sent each crew member an engraved crystal bowl in appreciation.”\nAbout that TV show…\nWhile all admitted to watching the short-lived ABC series “Pan Am,” there were a few discrepancies they were quick to point out.\nThe funniest was the fact that the stewardesses wore their hats, jackets and gloves in the cabin when they were serving passengers.\n“No way!” they all said in unison.\n“We had smocks and lower-heeled shoes for those duties,” one said.\nOn a more serious note, they weren’t particularly happy with the morals portrayed.\n“I spent some time with the show’s producer in Atlanta,” Carroll said. “I said my main issue was with the young women in the show hopping from bed to bed fairly indiscriminately.\n“I pointed out that was not the case when we flew. For the most part, we were all well-brought-up, traditional women.\n“The producer told me the problem was that the scripts were being written by 20- and 30-somethings.”\nNor was there a lot of romance with pilots.\n“Most of them were at least 25 to 30 years our senior,” Stimmel noted.\n“Of course, we weren’t opposed to falling in love, which I think we all did more than once,” Sprecher said. “But most of us were too busy exploring the landmarks, cathedrals and museums, learning about the world around us and forging friendships — the kind that last a lifetime.”\nBy the time Pan Am stopped flying nearly 25 years ago, each of the stewardesses had gone on to other endeavors — illustrating the fact that they were all more than a pretty face.\nAmong the “locals,” Mary Stimmel went on to become an award-winning broadcast journalist with three Emmys and other awards, most for her documentary work.\nJoan Carroll left Pan Am for the fashion world, striding the New York runways for such luminaries as Oscar de la Renta and Anne Klein.\nAnd Sprecher has written a novel — “Flying” with a fellow stewardess that is based on their experiences “and tells the real story of what it was like to experience the world in Pan Am blue.”\nBut they are never too busy to stay connected.\n“We were best friends and we shared a lifestyle that few other people could comprehend,” McAllister said.\n“We really were the lucky few.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834295.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837364.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837364.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834302.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834304.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834296.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837366.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834304.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837366.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834300.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837365.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837365.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834295.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834299.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834296.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834299.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834298.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834301.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834303.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834305.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834298.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834297.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834300.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834302.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834303.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834301.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14834305.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14834297.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:03:26.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
