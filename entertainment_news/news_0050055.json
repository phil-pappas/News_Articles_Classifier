Seven IWMS experts co-wrote \" A quest for excellence: Guidance for CRE & FM executives implementing a global IWMS ,\" a publication by Planon—a market-leading specialist in Integrated Workplace Management Systems (IWMS) . The new book, authored by Bram Aarntzen , Geert-Jan Blom , Erik Jaspers , David Stillebroer, Koos van Rij and Marc Wetzelaer , is a guide focusing on their experiences of implementing global corporate real estate and facilities management software in complex cross-cultural environments.   Over the decades, corporate real estate and facilities management information systems evolved into the extensive systems as they are today, supporting the full scope of CRE and FM activities. The authors, all having spent their careers in corporate real estate and facilities management, have seen implementation projects grow in terms of scope and the number of stakeholders involved. \n\"Roll-outs for internationally operating organizations take implementation projects to yet another level,\" said Jaspers. \"Diversity in cultures, legislation, languages spoken, metric units of area, and currencies represent significant factors to plan for. Not only should the software support these differences technically, these differences should also be taken into account during the implementation of CRE and FM processes.\"  \nPlanon—founded in 1982—recognizes these difficulties, which is why it is publishing the book. The publication will share experiences and insights from customers and external market specialists from different countries. Pierre Guelen, CEO and founder of Planon, states, \"Implementing global processes and a worldwide system in a complex multicultural environment is certainly not easy, but based on our 33 years of experience and our international footprint we believe we can explain how to do this successfully.\" \nThe publication gives the reader a clear path on the most important elements which play a role in implementing and using an IWMS system on a global basis. Pierre Guelen continues: \"We believe that by sharing the ideas and experiences gathered in this publication we can help the reader on their path to establish a truly global CRE and FM practice and guide them in successfully selecting, implementing and operating an international IWMS.\" \nFor more information about ordering a copy of \" A quest for excellence: Guidance for CRE & FM executives implementing a global IWMS ,\" click here .\nWith over 30 years of experience, Planon is the leading global provider of software that supports organizations that aim to optimize workplaces, services and assets.
