It’s the people,\" said Mike Donehey, the group's lead singer, in an interview last week. With that thinking, there's nowhere that is a \"secular\" place; the person's mere presence makes it a sacred place. \n\"That’s really what we’re hoping to communicate with the record and the tour,\" Donehey said. \nThe GMA Dove Award-winning group will perform a sold-out show Thursday at Calvary Community Church. The tour includes guests Sidewalks Prophets and Dan Bremnes. \nWith the group's concerts, \"we hope to both entertain and enlighten,\" Donehey added. \nThe group is made up of Donehey, drummer Jason Jamison, bassist Ruben Juarez, keyboardist Brendon Shirley and guitarist Jeff Owen. Tenth Avenue North was born when Donehey, Jamison and Owen met more than a decade ago at Palm Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach, Florida. The group is named after the avenue next to two of the members' student housing. \nTenth Avenue North won New Artist of the Year in 2009 at the GMA Dove Awards and has racked up multiple Dove nominations since. Donehey said it was far from overnight fame, though. \n\"We've been a band for 15 years. It doesn't feel overnight at all to me,\" Donehey said. \"Success is so relative, so it kind of depends on who’s looking at you and what they’re judging success by.\" \nWhat's the secret to the group staying together for so long? Donehey said, actually, it's embracing conflict. \n\"I think the thing that always gets relationships off track is secret grudges, secret bitterness,\" he said. \nUpfront remarks can be painful, but it's better than behind-people's-backs gossip, Donehey said. And compromise is key. \n\"I think that's what a lot of people don't understand: In order to love other people, then sometimes you have to be the one willing to take the hit,\" he said. \nOne message Tenth Avenue North is trying to spread is that simply doing one's job well is a way of honoring God. A plumber, for example, may not understand how he or she fits into that, Donehey said, but he points to Martin Luther'ss argument that a milkmaid's work can be as holy as a clergy member's. So can a plumber's, he said, jokingly adding, \"provided you keep your pants up.\" \nAs for what's next, Tenth Avenue North will be doing a Christmas tour, so the group members will be on the road right up until the end of the year, then they're doing a tour next year. \nAlso, \"we're writing again and trying to see if anything worth saying comes out,\" Donehey said. \nFollow Kate Kompas on Twitter @copygirlkate, or call her at 259-3620. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/10/20/tenth-avenue-north-perform-sold-out-st-cloud-show/74147460/ MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:09:02.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
