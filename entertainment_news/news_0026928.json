READ MORE: Nick Grimshaw's Latest 'X Factor' Decision Sparks 'Fix' Accusations \nThe Filipino girl group have revealed their dad Dominador Cercado has got a brain tumour, which, if left untreated, will lead to him losing his sight. \nThe 59-year-old is in need of an operation which the family cannot currently raise the funds for, as Dominador was forced to give up his job as a machinist due to his illness, and is now collecting rubbish on the street. \n4th Impact \nThe band - made up of sisters Almira, Irene, Mylene, and Celena - told The Sun they are hoping to use winnings from the show to pay for the life-changing procedure. \n“He needs an operation but we don’t have the money to pay for it. That’s one of the main reasons we want to do ‘The X Factor’. \n“He was diagnosed last year and he has been hospitalised, but we need money for the operation. We need to raise £10,000 to pay for it.” \nThey added: \"His illness has affected us so much. Every time we sing, it’s for him. It’s our motivation. He inspires us and we would love him to come over to the UK and see us in ‘The X Factor’.” \n4th Impact will battle it out at Judges' Houses this weekend \nEarlier this week, the band, who were formerly known as 4th Power, spoke of how many members of their family had been affected by Typhoon Koppu in the Philippines . \n“Their houses are destroyed and I think they are safe, we are thankful for that, but knowing we were born there and there’s a big calamity that they are facing right now... it’s very terrible,” they said on ‘ Good Morning Britain ’ on Monday. \n“Now we are experiencing this glamour [on ‘The X Factor’] but then our relatives there are experiencing that, it’s very heartbreaking. \n“Our home town Isabela, it’s in North Philippines, so we are knowing from the posts from our relatives that their roofs have literally gone off and there are floods everywhere… now I think there is no electricity in our home town.” \n4th Impact will be seen fighting for a place on the ‘X Factor’ live shows at mentor Cheryl Fernandez-Versini ’s Judges’ Houses this weekend. \n‘The X Factor’ continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV. Close 'X Factor': Greatest Ever Performances of   He was the Marmite contestant from series four, and while Rhydian put in plenty of memorable performances, it's this classical interpretation of Pink's 'Get The Party Started' that really stood out for us (and that's even without mentioning that fabulous faux-fur coat). As The X Factor's original novelty act way back in 2005, Chico paved the way for the likes of Jedward, Rylan and Wagner when performed his own song 'Chico Time' for the judges. Placed in the bottom two in just week two of series five, Ruth knew she had to dig deep to stay in the competition. The result was this stunning performance of one of Prince's greatest hits. Stacey transformed from a single mum from Dagenham into a silky-voiced songbird during her time on the show in 2009, and who could forget this performance from the live final, which saw her go head-to-head with Olly Murs and Joe McElderry for the 'X Factor' crown. The beef between Rylan and Gary Barlow defined series nine of the show in 2012, and oh how we LOL'd when the flamboyant contestant addressed their feud by walking through the doors singing one of Take That's hits. But the fun didn't end there, as he then continued with a mash-up of 'Groove Is In The Heart' and 'Gagnam Style' surrounded Karl Lagerfeld look-a-likes, natch. Yes Nicole stole all the big lines, and yes she was totally determined to upstage finalist Sam at every turn, but this performance from the 2014 final is still pretty epic. We just don't know where to start with why this Jedward performance is so good, but the PVC suits, the bad dancing and the slightly creepy middle-eight are a definite starting point. Five years on and we still can't help but feel that Aiden was kicked off 'The X Factor' way before his time, especially after turning out haunting performances like this one. Wagner's mash up of these two classic hits is mainly included in our countdown for being the first (and only) time a set of bongos was used in an 'X Factor' performance. 'X Factor' bosses may have tried to scrub James from the show's history after he was dropped for his controversial behavior following his win in 2013, but we'll always remember him for bringing dupstep to the ITV talent show. 'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' is one of those songs that has been covered a zillion times, but, dare we say it, Matt really made it his own when he performed it in 2010, even making Dannii Minogue weep in the process. Olly wowed the judges when he performed this song in his first audition, so naturally he chose to do the Stevie Wonder classic again during the live shows in series six, except this time, there was even slicker dance moves and ounces more popstar magic. Similarly, a little-remembered band called One Direction also chose to perform a song they'd done earlier in the competition on one of the live shows. 'Torn' was the first song they'd sung as a group after being put together for Judges Houses, and when the lads did it the second time around, you could tell it really meant something to them. Pity nothing ever became of them after that... After weeks of singing dreary ballads (admittedly, still very well) back in series seven, Becs decided to show us what she was really made of with this uptempo number, and we liked it. We liked it a lot. While this performance from Ella Henderson may not have been on the live shows, we think you'll agree it deserves its spot in our top ten. As Gary Barlow said, she turned Cher's 'Believe' from one of the most annoying songs of all time, into one we'd pay to hear again, while also reducing Nicole Scherzinger to a gibbering wreck. Simon Cowell still states that this is still his top performance in 'X Factor' history, and also marked the moment Leona cemented herself as the favourite to win series three in 2006. While Cher certainly made an impression with her first audition, she came under scrutiny after making it through to the live shows over Gamu, having put in a less-than-impressive performance at Judges Houses. Then came this version of Shakespeare's Sister's 'Stay', which certainly shut the haters up. After becoming real contenders to win the show thanks to their rendition of Katy Perry's 'ET', the Little Mix girls followed it up with this effortlessly classy performance of En Vogue's 'Don't Let Go'. And dare we say it, we prefer it to the original. Alexandra's duet with Beyoncé went down in 'X Factor' history, and no doubt helped her win series five in 2008. Even today, it is still the benchmark for other celebrity duets in the final, and it's safe to say we've not seen one as good since. Fleur took a massive risk when she chose to perform 'Uptown Funk', as not only had it not even been released, many people had barely heard the track. But it paid dividends, and her version of the song shot straight to the top of the iTunes chart in 2014, with Simon adding that it was also one of his favourite talent show performances EVER. Praise indeed.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:24:19.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
