Blessed with the all-important directorial power of final cut control, whatever ends up in the finished product is because of Abrams's say-so and not some Disney exec's. © Disney / LucasfilmJJ Abrams (left) on the set of Star Wars: The Force Awakens During an hour-long talk with Vanity Fair, Brian Glazer bent Abrams's ear about what was what with the eagerly-anticipated sci-fi. Asked whether he had final cut, Abrams said: \"Yeah, yeah,\" before adding: \"When you do a Disney project, there's a clause in there that you kind of go, 'Well, if I were a lawyer I could probably drive a truck through it...'\"This means, in effect, that if The Force Awakens was a total dog's dinner, Disney could pull it away from a director. Given that hasn't happened, it's still Abrams's movie. © @Bad_RobotJJ Abrams during The Force Awakens' pre-production period Well, Abrams and his producers' movie, at any rate...\"I cannot say enough about how [Disney head honchos] Bob Iger and Alan Horn have understood this thing that is now part of the Disney company,\" added Abrams. \"And they're not trying to 'Disney-fy' it, they're not doing anything other than, I think, an incredibly smart thing, which is letting Kathleen Kennedy - who is a remarkable person and producer - run and lead Lucasfilm to a place where I think it wants to go. They let us make the movie we wanted to make.\"Kathleen Kennedy is, of course, in charge of the new Lucasfilm, and a veteran of many Spielberg projects (amongst other things), including The Goonies, Jurassic Park and Lincoln. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is released in UK cinemas on December 17.
