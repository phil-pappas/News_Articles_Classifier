Acai,  coconut water, goji berries. Not only is a lot of the \"science\" behind these miracle foods not especially robust, there's something fundamentally unhealthy about the fetishisation of eating. If popular media is any guide, there are only two styles of consuming food these days: a diet of unmitigated junk that's killing us all, or a trend-driven frenzy of unpronounceable (and often unprocurable) ingredients that will make us live forever. Whatever happened to just enjoying fresh food? Well, Jamie Oliver makes it clear in the opening moments of this new series that's pretty much what he's talking about. And on reflection, we shouldn't have expected anything less. Whatever his flaws, the Naked Chef has always had a distinctly wholesome and pragmatic approach to cooking and eating – it's how he made his name – and Super Foods comprehensively rejects faddish obsessions (except, perhaps, for our obsession with the label \"superfood\") to present a lively, thoughtful excursion in to great food that's good for you. The hook is his travels to some of the places in the world renowned for the longevity of their residents (including Greece, Japan and Costa Rica), where he collects recipes and the lowdown on key ingredients and habits of eating, then brings it all home to interpret for us. The actual information is nothing any dietician would disagree with: lots of fresh fruit and veg, good quality carbs, lean protein, eggs. But Jamie has a way of making this grandmotherly advice seem fresh and exciting and he's clever enough to have devised a range of recipes that fit the basic health bill but take it all way beyond grilled fish and salad. (The French toast breakfast in this first ep, for instance, is inspired.) It's telling, of course, that we need to be reminded of the importance of a fresh, balanced diet. But wonderful to see Mr Oliver – as he would say himself – getting stuck right in. \nTHE WALKING DEAD\n★★★★\nMonday, October 26, 7.30pm, 8.30pm, FX \nAnnabel Crabb in Kitchen Cabinet . Photo: Supplied \nYou don't have to be a fan of the zombie genre generally, or of The Walking Dead in particular, to be in awe of the skill with which this show is constructed. (To wring six seasons from a pretty straightforward apocalyptic scenario is quite the feat in itself.) At the meta level, The Walking Dead can be read in all kinds of ways: as a meditation on what it means to be human; as an essay on the exercise of power; as a parable – in the classic zombie tradition – of the endpoint of consumerism. From episode to episode it does what all great TV series do: have us emotionally invest in three-dimensional characters who have convincingly grown and evolved over the course of five harrowing years. And at its best, any individual instalment can be a work of art. Creepy art, sure. But some of the best stuff is. Case in point: the opening ep of season six. There was very little impaling and flesh-eating. Instead there was a delicious slow build, very cleverly constructed, that opened with the second most dramatic moment (the escape of the zombie hordes from the quarry) then inexorably drew us forward through a perfect blend of action, ethics, politics and metaphysics to its truly horrifying conclusion. \nAdvertisement BLINDSPOT\nNew series ★★★\nWednesday, October 28, Seven \nImagine Prison Break meets The Bourne Identity (but featuring a skinny chick rather than muscly blokes) and you have some idea of the premise of this new US thriller. A skinny chick (Jaimie Alexander) is discovered in a duffle bag in Times Square (bear with me…) covered chin to ankles in tattoos – including the name of an FBI agent (our very own Sullivan Stapleton). How mysterious! Who is she? What do the tattoos mean? And why has the handsomest man in the FBI been singled out? \nBRAIN SURGERY LIVE\n ★★★★\nMonday, October 26, noon, 8.30pm, NatGeo  \nTV – and modern technology – are amazing in all kinds of ways but it's hard to think of much that's more amazing than this. Actual brain surgery. On a conscious patient. Being beamed live around the world. The (ahem) cutting edge procedure – deep brain stimulation – will be performed at a specialist centre in Cleveland, Ohio, intercut (sorry) with lots of broader factual information about this most mysterious organ and commentary from neurosurgeon Dr Rahul Jandial and neuroscientist Cara Santa Maria. It promises to be absolutely fascinating. \nMAKING FAMILIES HAPPY\nNew series ★★★&frac12;\nTuesday, October 27, 8.30pm, ABC \nAfter being pulled off air (for sensitive family reasons) earlier in the year, this excellent three-part factual series has returned. Following in the footsteps of its predecessors ( Making Australia Happy and Making Couples Happy ) it attempts to use the latest in sociological and psychological science to help three very different, very unhappy families find a better way of being. We might not all be in crisis but there's plenty here that will be familiar to most clans, making the journey as instructive as it is moving.\nLIFE IN SQUARES\nNew series \n★★★\nTuesday, October 27, 8.30pm, BBC First \nThis biographical mini-series on the lives of the Stephens sisters – Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf – plays like an Edwardian novel reads. Although an early scene has both young ladies literally throwing off their corsets, there's a distinct lack of oxygen. There's lots of sex, and a very handsome cast, but it's all very mannered and stagey and not helped one whit by stodgy direction. That may be deliberate, a kind of evocation of the times, but the result is a little too polite to be really engaging. \nKITCHEN CABINET\nSeries return\n★★★&frac12;\nWednesday, October 28, 8pm, ABC \nGiven the combative, often vitriolic nature of Australian politics these days – not just in Parliament House but in the general community – there's something enormously worthwhile about being reminded that our elected representatives are also living, breathing human beings. Tonight Annabel Crabb returns with a fifth season of this lively, often funny and always informative series and the first dish of the day is Scott Morrison. You're guaranteed to discover all kinds of stuff you never knew – including the fact that he makes a mean samosa. \nTHE SIMPSONS HALLOWEEN MARATHON\n★★★&frac12;\nSaturday, October 31, 9.30pm, Fox8 \nOK, 9.30pm is a bit late for really little kids. And the content is probably a bit scary, too. But for bigger kids of all ages, 13 episodes of Treehouse of Horror on Halloween is hard to go past. There'll be funny tombstones (some even funnier 10 years down the track). There'll be Kang and Kodos. There'll be riffs on everything from Edgar Allen Poe to Dead Calm , including just about every scary film ever made. And, of course, there'll be lots and lots of gags.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:32:34.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
