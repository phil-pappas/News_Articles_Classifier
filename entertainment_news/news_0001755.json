That is mostly a good thing, as the band has clearly outgrown clubs like the 476-capacity Boston venue, and with their third record out, needs to continue broadening their audience. There were good signs Saturday night, along with the familiar VT qualities of yanking classic rock, soul and funk into the 21st century, and setting new standards for kinetic stage presence by singer Ty Taylor. There were longer instrumental showcases for guitarist Nalle Colt, and, to a lesser degree, the galvanizing rhythm section of bassist Rick Barrio Dill, and drummer Rich Danielson. VT is in no danger of turning into a jam band, but a little more opportunity for the band's three superb instrumentalists to showcase their skills is certainly welcome, even if it does extend some tunes beyond the five-minute mark. Saturday's 12-song set, comprised of seven songs from the latest album, this year's \"1 Hopeful Road,\" also showed more stylistic variety than some of their earlier, pedal-to-the-metal shows, with some sweet soul ballads and acoustic-flavored grooves. Which is not to say VT has abandoned any of their unique strengths, just added to them. The high point of Saturday's 75-minute show was Taylor's impassioned rendition of \"Run Like the River,\" where he strode out into the crowd, all the way to the back of the club. At that point Taylor climbed atop the main bar, and, as a bartender scurried to clear obstacles from his path (good job Tracy!), strode its length, while leading what was now a mass singalong. Reaching the end of the bar, Taylor motioned to a few fans, then dove off, where the fans caught him and quickly crowd-surfed him back to the stage. Crazy, spontaneous moments like that are Taylor's stock in trade, and along with his supple baritone, help make VT one of music's most wonderfully unpredictable acts. VT opened the show with \"Soul Serenity\" from the new album, and while it's soft, acoustic foundation and gospel roots made it a lovely soul ballad, the fact that it is not yet a familiar VT tune made it kind of an odd start. But the rockin' power, and Taylor's torrid dance-spins gave the crowd the needed jolt on \"Blues Hand Me Down,\" which is doubtless the best known VT song from their debut album. Another VT nugget, \"Still and Always Will,\" rode an interesting arrangement, which began midtempo but would ramp up for the choruses, before sliding back with a greasy, swampy kind of groove. That tune was also an early example of the quartet's evolving sound, as a Colt guitar solo enhanced it with added, though subtle, fire. \"Angel City\" from the new album, returned matters to the dance groove, but \"If You Loved Me\" was another standout soul ballad, albeit one accentuated by thunderclap drum beats. Page 2 of 2 - The asy-flowing groove of Doin' What Your Were Doin'\" combined Taylor's sweet soul vocal with an extended funk jam. The soft crooning vocal on \"Another Man's Words\" had Taylor evoking the best of Curtis Mayfield, while he channeled his inner Wilson Pickett on the hard-driving \"Get It Gone.\" That dazzling \"Run Like the River\" was the pinnacle of the regular set, but the long version of \"Strike Your Light\" ended the set with pell-mell r&b. Before that last tune of the regular set, Taylor noted how fast the band's rise had been since they started four years ago (was it just two years ago we saw them with 100 people at T.T. the Bear's?), and thanked the fans profusely for their support. It has surely been a rapid ascent for the foursome, which spent much of their summer opening the AC/DC national tour. VT's first encore was a smooth soul ballad, \"Nobody Told Me,\" showcasing Taylor's vocals and the other members' underrated harmony vocal skills, in a setting that reminded older fans of The Chi-Lites. The pounding funk workout, \"Pelvis Pusher,\" with its silly refrain \"1-2-3, push your pelvis to me..\" ended the night in one more heated spasm of dancing giddiness. At its end, the four musicians simply marched offstage, through the crowd to the merchandise table, where they met fans, signed autographs and posed for pictures until the last person left.
