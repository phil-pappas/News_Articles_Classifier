If a man was acting in the same way that I was acting, it would just be considered normal,\" Mara noted.\"To me, that's the thing I find so frustrating is calling women spoiled brats and bitches. We just want to have a voice in our life, and I don't think that's anything that shouldn't be encouraged in any human.\"Jessica Chastain and Bradley Cooper both came out in support of Lawrence last week, with Chastain saying she was \"proud\" of the Hunger Games star for speaking out. © Rex Features Lawrence's American Hustle co-star Cooper added that he believes that her views are \"making a difference\".Many women in Hollywood have spoken up about inequality recently, with Thelma and Louise star Geena Davis saying it's \"frustrating\" to work in an industry where men and women are not considered equal.Sienna Miller also recently revealed she quit a play due to the significant pay difference between herself and her male co-star.Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow has said that her Avengers co-star Robert Downey Jr isn't worth the huge paycheques he receives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:02:02.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
