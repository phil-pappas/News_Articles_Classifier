Bob Mezan reports.   \nKhloe Kardashian and her basketball player husband, Lamar Odom, called off their divorce a week after the athlete collapsed and fell into a coma in Las Vegas. Various media outlets have reported that Kardashian's attorney asked a judge to withdraw the divorce petition that both sides had signed earlier this year and that was awaiting final approval. Kardashian and Odom split up in 2013 after a four-year marriage, but the reality TV star has been a constant presence at Odom's side since he was rushed to hospital after being found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. Last week, Odom's prognosis looked grim after several days on life support following a reported series of strokes after authorities said he used cocaine and herbal supplements. He was transferred on Monday (October 19) by helicopter from Las Vegas to a hospital in Los Angeles where he is currently being treated.  //reut.rs/1ZYKPWQ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:57:08.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
