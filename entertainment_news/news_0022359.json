Adele's fans should feel free to take it personally. She has been gone a long time, and they have been missing her. \n\"I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet. To go over everything.\" \nAny reasonable person would be making up excuses, if necessary, to miss that meaning. Adele inspires unreasonable devotion, though, and millions are waiting to take this call \nMusically, \"Hello\" starts out quiet and melancholy then swells into awesome Adele vocal fireworks. It's an epic drunk dial symphony. \nLike it or not, you and Adele are getting back together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:44:55.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
