Opera San Antonio delivers stunning “Butterfly” 1 / 4 Back to Gallery SAN ANTONIO — Presenting Giacomo Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly” to start its second season, Opera San Antonio on Thursday proved its first-season success with Richard Strauss’ “Salome” was not a fluke.\nThe singing, acting, set, lighting, costumes and orchestral music flowed into an emotional and compelling unity for a level of quality that was something to behold.\nLet’s start with the ending of “Butterfly.” It was shattering. Utterly devastating. Anyone would have to see it to believe it. It was bold and stunning.\nThe night, as always with this opera, belonged to the soprano. Maria Kanyova as Butterfly grew, scene by scene, from a giddy geisha teen to a full-grown adult, afflicted by desperate love.\nKanyova, a veteran of this role on numerous big opera stages, sang with her soul, her powerful, nuanced voice bigger than her petite figure. Everything from her glances to her hand gestures added to the drama. Her “One Fine Day” aria drew avid applause. Kanyova’s farewell aria to her son, was heartbreaking.\nTenor Adam Diegel had the difficult task trying to show character growth in Act Three from the boastful jerk that Lieutenant Pinkerton seems to be in the first act. Diegel was convincing in his remorse, though, his voice sturdy and assured.\nMezzo Kristen Choi was forceful as Butterfly’s maid. So was Luis Ledesma as Consul Sharpless, his baritone voice exuding more maturity and awareness than Pinkerton.\nJacob Aiden Kania, as Butterfly’s 3-year-old son, was a charming little scene-stealer who enchanted the audience of about 1,450, which included Mayor Ivy Taylor.\nThe set, which debuted to acclaim at last year’s Glimmerglass Festive in New York, was dynamic, full of details, like office file cabinets and a waiting room in the American consuls office, but minimal for the Japan settings, making the audience see the story more through American eyes.\nThe stylish costumes, owned by the San Diego Opera, seemed to accentuate the differences between American and Japanese dress.\nThe stage lighting added tremendous value to the drama, too, especially the sunset/sunrise scene ending Act II as Butterfly stood in silhouette in a suffering, madonna-like pose, arms partially outstretched.\nThe San Antonio Symphony, under Music Director Sebastian Lang-Lessing, pulled it all together with a rich, polished performance of Puccini’s wonderfully orchestrated melodies.\n“Butterfly” repeats at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.\ndhendricks@express-news.net Twitter: @ davidahendricks", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724339/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724339/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724336/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724343/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724336/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724334/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724334/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724343/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:54:20.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
