This time, the singer addresses such issues as rape, mass shootings, human trafficking, racial inequality, police brutality and domestic violence. The video is directed by Carmen Murray and only has one set. Fiona appears bruised and trapped in a glass box while newspaper headlines pop up in front of her. Among the headlines are real-life events like Trayvon Martin's shooting, Michael Brown's murder, Sandra Bland's hanging and Eric Garner's chokehold death. \"It is important for me to channel the ideas and concepts I am passionate about into my music and my art,\" Fiona told Complex. \"As an artist with a social platform, I feel it is my responsibility to do so. The video for 'I Tried' is a tribute to the fight in which we all witness and experience both internally and externally in the world daily. The conversation of important issues should not end when we turn the TV off. I hope this visual sparks emotion, thought, dialogue, reflection, and ultimately, positive change.\" \"I Tried\" is a single lifted from Fiona's upcoming album, \" Awake \". Speaking of the single, she told Vibe, \"That was the first song that I wrote for the album, and it comes from a place of when you get to the point where you're like, 'Well, I tried being good and I tried doing all these things, so I might as well just give into the darkness.' Everything is about thoughts or moments of clarity for me.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:59:32.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
