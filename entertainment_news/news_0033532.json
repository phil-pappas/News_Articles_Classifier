It makes perfect sense. Why couldn’t I see it before?\nThere could never have been a Holocaust had the Jews been armed. Granted, the Nazis swept aside the armies of Poland and France like dandruff, and it took six years for Great Britain — later joined by Russia and the United States — to grind them down. But surely Jewish civilians with revolvers and hunting rifles would have made all the difference.\nMuch as I’d love to take credit for that insight, I can’t. No, it comes from presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson in a recent interview with CNN.\nThis has become a recurrent theme on the political right, the idea that unarmed victims of violence are to blame for their own troubles. And not just in the Holocaust. Rush Limbaugh said two years ago that if African Americans had been armed, they wouldn’t have needed a Civil Rights Movement. The founder of so-called “Gun Appreciation Day” said, also two years ago, that had the Africans been armed, there could have been no slavery.\nIt’s so clear to me now. Guns don’t take lives, they save them. Guns make everything better. Carson is a surgeon, not an optometrist, but golly gosh, he’s sure opened my eyes.\nAnd what if the men on Titanic had been armed? That tragedy might have had a happier ending:\nLOOKOUT\nIceberg dead ahead!\nCAPTAIN\nNo time to port around it. Get your guns, men! We’re making ice cubes out of this sucker!\nKATE WINSLET\nJack, is that a Colt in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?\nLEONARDO DICAPRIO\nIt’s a Colt, woman. Now, stand aside.\nHey, what if Jesus had been armed?\n“Thou wisheth to nail me to what? I think not. Come on, punks. Maketh my day!”\nThe possibilities are endless. So I’ve taken the liberty of composing a new campaign song for Carson, to the tune of “If I Only Had a Heart” from “The Wizard of Oz”:\nWhen a man’s an empty holster, no courage does he bolster\nNo confidence is won\nWhat a difference he’d be makin’, he could finally stop his quakin’\nIf he only had a gun\nHe could stand a little straighter with that ultimate persuader\nAnd wouldn’t that be fun?\nHe could put an end to static with a semiautomatic\nIf he only had a gun\nCan’t you see, how it would be?\nWoe would avoid his door\nThe crazy guy would pass him by\nOr else he’d shoot — and shoot some more\nOh, the shootin’ he’d be doin’, and all the ballyhooin’\nThe way the folks would run\nHis life would be so merry in a world of open carry\nIf he only had a gun\nIf you think Carson might like the song, I would not mind at all if you shared it with him: www.bencarson.com/contact.\nWhat’s that? You think I’ve lost my mind? You’re calling me crazy? Boy, that makes me so mad I can hardly control myself!\nIf I only had a gun...\nLeonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:15:23.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
