Lahari Audio, the owners of the copyright on the two old songs, have demanded damages of Rs 10 lakh per day from the day of the film's release.In a growing trend, owners of audio rights are increasingly suing filmmakers for using bits or full old film songs in their films. In recent months, several filmmakers have had to pay dearly for `copying' old songs. In RX Suri's case, the Rs 10 lakh per day demand is the highest ever made.The film released on September 4. It is 35 days since the summons was issued on Wednesday. So the damages claimed till date is Rs 3.5 crore.\nThe allegation was that the songs Anatha Maguvade (from the 1990 film Hosa Jeevana) and another song from Chaitrada Premanjali (1992) were used in RX Suri which released earlier this year. The case in the lower court was filed a month ago and a petition was filed in the high court also. The lower court issued a summons to the filmmaker on Wednesday after the notice it issued earlier didn't elicit a response.\nLahari Audio's Tulsiram Naidu said, \"Producer Suresh had spoken to us about using the songs. We were negotiating the price, but in the end, he used the songs without taking permission from us. In this case, he knew he had to take permission and this was not done. It should have been clear that we would take legal action.Now that the matter is in court, it is for the law to take its own course.It would be wrong to comment at this stage.\"\nIn recent months, several filmmakers have had to pay for `copying' older songs. Nagshekar-directed Myna was ordered to pay Rs 5 lakh for using a song from an album by a city court recently. Jayanna-produced Ranavikrama settled the issue of `copying' a portion of the song from Ranaranga by reportedly paying Rs 20 lakh.\nThe case of Mr Airavatha which released last week was even more curious. Music composer Harikrishna was accused of copying two songs from Telugu; one from Aagudu and another from Race Gurram. The audio album of the film was released under Harikrishna's own company D-Beats. But after the allegation, the entire rights of the album were transferred to Lahari Audio which owned the copyrights in the Telugu films.\nMeanwhile, audio companies are readying to take the fight to music composers and singers. Naidu, who is also the president of the Karnataka Audio Companies Association, said, \"We never asked for money from composers and singers performing on stage. They use our songs for the performance and are legally liable to pay us royalty. From now on, action will be taken against them as well. They charge Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore for a stage show. Yes, of course, no one will pay if I perform on stage, but it is our copyright and henceforth, those using it will have to pay for it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:24:25.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
