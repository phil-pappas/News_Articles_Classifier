My dad always tells me when I’m being a d**k,” he said on the green carpet. (Yui Mok/PA) \nJustin Bieber, Maisie Williams, Olly Murs, new Spider-Man star Tom Holland and Nathan Sykes were amongst the celebrity guests who supported Ed at the film premiere in London’s Leicester Square, which is also being streamed live across the country and worldwide. \nMaisie, best known for playing Arya Stark in the fantasy series, said she is a long-time fan of the singer. \nShe said: “I met him a year ago and I’m a mad supporter. So any way I can support him I will, but he’s a megastar now so he doesn’t need me. I love his music. He’s stayed true to himself and never tried to be anything he’s not. He’s very real and honest and a beautiful artist in that sense.” (Yui Mok/PA) \nOlly added: “I love Ed. He’s incredibly talented, he’s unique and he’s different. That’s what makes him incredible. He’s someone who has made a massive influence to someone like myself – and he’s humble as well.” Promoted stories \nBut it was Justin who got fans most excited. The crowds cheered and screamed when the Never Say Never pop star pulled up in a silver people carrier and stepped out, with his hood covering his face. \nAfter signing autographs and taking some photos with fans, the Biebs met up with the Game Of Thrones star and her friend before jumping back in his car and leaving. (Yui Mok/PA) \nEd said: “I didn’t think anyone was going to turn up. I’ve never had a film in a cinema. It’s quite a weird thing for a musician to be doing this in Leicester Square so it’s cool.” I'm so excited for you guys to see this movie. Check your local cinema listings wherever worldwide, it's only gonna be shown this weekend \n— Ed Sheeran (@edsheeran) October 22, 2015 \nThe singer from Suffolk has had a hugely successful year, which includes Brit and Ivor Novello wins, an honorary doctorate and a care home suite named after him. His second album x continues to remain in the top 10. (Yui Mok/PA) \nHe said: “I don’t need anything else. I’m good. The album has sold more than people thought it would, the film’s doing better than people thought it would, I have all my family and friends with me and I’m in a good place.” \nJumpers For Goalposts is a documentary of Sheeran’s sold-out Wembley Stadium tour, which took place over three dates in July. (Yui Mok/PA) \nEd also confirmed a role in the third Bridget Jones film alongside Renee Zellweger, Bridget Jones’ Baby, but admitted he is in the dark about his part. \nHe said: “Strangely enough, I was doing a fight sequence in a TV show called The B", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:21:31.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
