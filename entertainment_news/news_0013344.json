I can raise my eyebrow but that's not what it takes to play Bond,\" he told reporters. \nSpeaking at the British premiere of his new film Black Mass, he admits it would be \"fun\". \nBut he thinks producers may want to go in \"different directions\" next. \nIt's still not clear if Daniel Craig will make another Bond film after Spectre, which is in cinemas on 26 October. Image caption Tom Hiddleston was taking selfies on the red carpet in London's Leicester Square \nEarlier this month, he claimed he'd only do it \"for the money\", saying he was \"over it at the moment\" and didn't want to think about it for \"at least a year or two\". \nLast week, Thor actor Tom Hiddleston told Newsbeat he would enjoy the role if it became available. \nBut he says he hasn't been formally approached and wouldn't want to \"usurp Daniel Craig's place\". \nIdris Elba's also been linked to the part of 007 after a leaked email from Sony suggested he was being considered. \nElba has previously said he \"feels like a national treasure\" being associated with the speculation. Image caption Benedict Cumberbatch was at the premiere with his wife Sophie Hunter \nHomeland actor David Harewood has also said he'd like to play 007. \nIdris Elba, Damian Lewis and Tom Hardy are among the bookies' favourites for the part. \nIn an interview with Time Out magazine last week, Daniel Craig was asked about his future as James Bond. \nAsked whether he could imagine doing another film, he said: \"Now? I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\" \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:55:31.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
