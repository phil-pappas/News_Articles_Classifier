Henson) and Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard). \nTHE meteoric rise of the television show Empire was the ultimate success story of last season — restoring network TV’s reputation as a place where viewers could go for exciting quality entertainment after years of decline. \nDebuting in mid-season with 13 episodes — and pulling in huge numbers in the US which grew each week — Empire was quickly renewed and given a slot on the networks’ Autumn schedule. Fox also increased the show’s number of episodes to 18. \nBut the rush to Season 2 may have hurt Empire . Four episodes in, it has become predictable and stuck in dramatic second gear. \nIn short, the excitement that made Empire a ‘can’t miss’ TV show is gone. \nEmpire is still drawing big numbers in the US (12.2 million for Wednesday night’s episode). And all the elements that distinguished it from your average prime-time soap are still there: the extended musical performances, the loud fashions and the industry-insider feel. \nBut last month’s season premiere included a dramatic about-face so inconsistent with what had already happened that it was easy to see that Empire was beginning to get away from itself. We’re talking about the final scene, when Jamal (Jussie Smollett) — the gay underdog son who found a champion for his musical ambitions in another underdog, his mother, ex-con Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) — slammed the door in her face, shutting her out of Empire records. Which was now up-and-running, thanks to her efforts.
