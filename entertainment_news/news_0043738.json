The website claimed that \"there may be a little bun in the oven\" though they had filed for divorce. The publication even said that the baby Jennifer's currently expecting would turn around their divorce decision. \"Even though they're going through a divorce, Jen is pregnant for the fourth time,\" it read. \"They actually conceived this child during a one night stand, but it certainly would be amazing if a baby did help save the relationship!\" Later on, the publication quoted a source as saying, \"Jen is 100% pregnant.\" Furthermore, it tried to relate Ben's presence at some family occasions to Jennifer's pregnancy. \"Ben has been spending lots of time with Jen and the kids at the family compound,\" said the source. Responding to the report, a rep for the 43-year-old actress told Gossip Cop , \"It's not true.\" Jennifer isn't currently pregnant with baby No. 4 and they're not going to dismiss their divorce paper. The two announced their divorce in late June after 10 years of marriage. Following their divorce announcement, the two were said to continue on living in the same property in L.A., though in separate houses, to co-parent their children. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:08:23.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
