There was Dobson’s infamous 100-yard interception return for a touchdown that quelled a Texas State comeback last season, which gave the free safety three picks on the year. Williams, a linebacker, leads GSU in tackles this season and is second on the team in sacks.\nBut after all was said and done, after an historic upset of Florida in 2013 and the celebration of hoisting a Sun Belt Trophy in 2014, they sat at home with a 9-3 record and watched other teams on both sides of the Division I spectrum play in December.\nNorth Dakota State won the FCS national title. South Alabama, a team the Eagles beat 28-6 earlier that year, played in the Camellia Bowl in Montgomery, Alabama, and finished 6-7.\nThe 2012 season ended in heartbreak for the Eagles with a 23-20 loss in the FCS national semifinals to North Dakota State, which was also the national champion that season. Williams was a sophomore then and Dobson just a freshman, and neither would be able to play in another postseason game until this season.\n“That was a tough loss up there,” Dobson said about the 2012 semifinals in which the Eagles outgained the Bison offensively 430 yards to 276. “We’re definitely itching to get back to the postseason.”\nThe Eagles were set to make the step up to the Football Bowl Subdivision in 2014, and that came with the stipulation of having to sit out of postseason play for two years — the FCS playoffs in 2013 and a bowl game last season.\nThe Eagles had made it to the semifinals in back-to-back seasons and were expected to reload in 2013 even after losing safety J.J. Wilcox (a third-round NFL draft pick), All-America defensive lineman Brent Russell and All-Southern Conference standouts Darius Eubanks and Dion Dubose. But injuries plagued GSU, including Williams, who had to take a medical redshirt, and the Eagles finished a disappointing 7-4 in head coach Jeff Monken’s final season.\nWilliams and Dobson got to share in some memorable experiences in place of a playoff or bowl game, starting with the upset over Florida in The Swamp, a win that seemed to make the whole season worthwhile, and one that provided momentum heading into an FBS schedule.\nThen they cemented the new era by winning the Sun Belt with an 8-0 league record.\n“It’s good for the school,” Dobson said. “For the seniors, those two years were a little tough on us. But that’s what we had to do.”\nIt was particularly hard on Williams, the redshirt senior who sustained a tear in his right triceps in preseason camp of 2013. No one hit him. No one touched him. He just simply moved the wrong way.\n“It was one of those things where we felt like we had the opportunity, we just got plagued by injuries as the season went on,” Williams said. “Then we transitioned, and that kind of took the wind out of a team that we felt like could have made a normal run to a (FCS) national championship. Last year, I felt like we had a great season, and it was tough to be sitting at home in December.”\nLooking back on it, however, if not for the injury, Williams wouldn’t be anchoring a unit that ranks third in the conference in total defense. He wouldn’t have a chance to play in what would be school’s first bowl game.\nAnd that’s been the focus since August.\n“Going into this year, we understand that we’re playing for 13 games,” Williams said. “We’ve got our mind prepared that if we do our best in these 12, we can get to the biggest bowl game we can, and when we get there, we’ve got to treat it with a Super Bowl attitude.”\nThe Eagles could get a spot in one of four bowl games reserved for Sun Belt teams: the Camellia Bowl in Montgomery, the New Orleans Bowl, the Cure Bowl in Orlando, Florida, and the GoDaddy Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. The competition is tough with teams like Memphis, Houston and Temple holding down spots in The Associated Press Top 25 poll, but if the Eagles (5-1, 3-0 Sun Belt) win out, they could enter the conversation as being the top-ranked Group of Five program and get an invite into a New Year’s Six bowl game.\nWilliams put it simply that reaching the minimum six wins wouldn’t be an achievement to brag about.\n“Getting to six wins will be nice, but being 10-2 or 11-1, those are some great numbers right there,” he said.\nNathan Deen covers Georgia Southern for the Savannah Morning News.
