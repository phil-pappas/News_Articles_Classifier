The decision on whether or not to try Griego as an adult or as a juvenile will not be determined until the beginning of next year. However, the thought of having a “psycho-murderer” out on the street in just a few years is frightening Albuquerque residents.\nAs the Albuquerque Journal reports on October 16, Nehemiah Griego pleaded guilty before Judge John Romero in Children’s Court in Albuquerque on Friday morning. Jeffrey Buckels and Stephen Taylor, Griego’s attorneys, stated that an “amenability hearing” in January will determine if Griego will be sentenced as a juvenile or an adult.\n“If sentenced as a juvenile, he will be committed to the custody of the Children, Youth and Families Department until he is 21 years old. If he is sentenced as an adult, he faces a sentence that ranges from probation to three life sentences plus 30 years.”\nIn January 2013, at the age of 15, Griego used a .22 caliber rifle from his parent's closet to shoot his mother, Sarah Griego, and his three younger siblings, 9-year-old Zephaniah, 5-year-old Jael and 2-year-old Angelina, while they were in their beds. Griego ambushed his father – who was known for his ministry work with inmates at the county jail -- with a military-style semi-automatic rifle. According to court documents, the teen’s motive for his heinous crime was that “he had anger issues and was annoyed with his mother.”\nNehemiah Griego pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder in the shooting deaths of his parents and three counts of child abuse resulting in death for the murder of his siblings. By January 2016, Griego will be 18, meaning he is facing only three years in a juvenile detention center. According to the Bernalillo County District Attorney's Office, the teen’s potential light sentencing might occur because of his plea deal.", "external_links": ["http://www.abqjournal.com/660928/abqnewsseeker/nehemiah-griego-pleads-guilty-to-fatally-shooting-his-family.html", "http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s3937804.shtml"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:29:34.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
