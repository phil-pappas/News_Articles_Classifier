They couldn’t. \nDid they? Could they? \nFans of AMC’s zombie apocalypse drama The Walking Dead were still reeling in shock Monday, when – and this is your one and only chance to stop reading before being tainted by spoilers – one of the show’s best-loved characters seemed to meet a grisly demise. \nIn Sunday night’s third episode of Season 6, titled Thank You, resourceful, honest, always-got-your-back Glenn (Steven Yeun) became the latest character to die on the show, proving once again that no one is safe on The Walking Dead. Not even people who have been around for nearly the entire run of the series. \nBut some fans refuse to believe it. And they might just be right. \nOn Sunday’s episode, we caught up with Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his gang as they tried to cope with their zombie relocation scheme going horribly off the rails. As the survivors tried to beat a retreat back to Alexandria, part of the group got trapped in a small town surrounded by the undead. \nAttempting to create a diversion to lure the zombies away, Glenn and shifty Nicholas (Michael Traynor) were caught in a dead end alley as a massive group of zombies approached them. The pair climbed on top a dumpster to delay the inevitable, but Nicholas apparently couldn’t wait – after a hoarse “thank you” to Glenn, he put a gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. \nThe blast from the gunshot, along with Nicholas’ falling body, stunned Glenn enough to send him tumbling off the dumpster and into the swarm of zombies below, who quickly began tearing into him. (The cruel irony is Nicholas tried to kill Glenn last season, but Glenn forgave him and allowed Nicholas to work with him during Operation Zombie Parade.) \nYet almost as soon as the shock of Glenn’s death started reverberating through social media, some observant fans began speculating that he wasn’t really killed. Much like the shocking assassination of Jon Snow on last season’s Game of Thrones finale, Glenn’s death scene is being analyzed for signs that he may come out of this alive. \nWhile it does look like Glenn is screaming in pain as zombies tear into his guts, it could actually be Nicholas’ body sprawled on top of Glenn at the bottom of the camera frame, and all those juicy entrails that the zombies are gobbling up belong to Nicholas. \nWhen a major character gets killed off on The Walking Dead, we normally think that they’re truly dead. Think of Shane, Lori, Dale, Hershel, Beth… basically every other major character who has bit the dust has done so in a way that clearly indicates they’re gone for food. With Glenn, the scene ends with a mob of zombies obscuring what’s happening. \nAlso, the actor playing the freshly killed character generally shows up as a guest on AMC’s The Talking Dead immediately after the episode. Steven Yeun wasn’t on the show Sunday night, and so far he doesn’t appear to have done any media interviews about Glenn’s death, another sign something unusual is up. (We requested an interview with Yeun early Monday and were told by AMC he’s unavailable.) \nAnd if you look closely at the scene, the zombies appear to be pulling intestines out of what would be Glenn’s chest. Not that we expect strict anatomical accuracy from a show about reanimated corpses, but it could be another sign that it’s actually Nicholas’ body flopped over Glenn, shielding him from the zombie attack, and that Glenn may be able to scramble to safety under the dumpster. \nLast but not least, The Walking Dead showrunner Scott Gimple said in a prepared statement – itself a bit of an odd move – that Glenn will be back in some form, whether in flashback or “in the current story.” Again, it’s very unusual for the show’s creators not to directly talk about a character’s death. \nIf Glenn does turn out to be dead – and the character has indeed already been killed off in the Walking Dead comics – it would seem doubly cruel to keep fans hanging like this, only to break their hearts again when it’s confirmed. \nBut all signs say Glenn’s time has not yet come. And while it looks like next week’s episode of The Walking Dead will primarily be a flashback about Morgan (Lennie James) and his mysterious past, you can bet we’ll be glued to upcoming episodes to see how this plays out. \nMaybe that was AMC’s plan all along. And you thought zombies were devious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:03:46.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
