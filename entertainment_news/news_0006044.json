Titled Kaan, the movie is said to be a spy thriller which was being produced by Selva’s wife Geethanjali and Siddharth Rao. Taapsee Pannu and Catherine Tresa were roped in to play the female leads. Tollywood actor Jagapathy Babu was brought on board for a crucial character. Selva’s longtime associates Yuvan Shankar Raja and Arvind Krishna were back for Kaan and even the first look poster grabbed a lot of attention. Reliable sources inform us that the film has been put in cold storage due to a financial crunch, and some production issues. However Selva has a different version to offer on his micro blog, “I have been hearing a lot of rumours about Kaan. I just want to clarify certain things. Kaan as a script is very close to my heart and is also an ambitious project. The team and I want to do justice to our vision. So, we have taken a mutual call to temporarily put the project on hold and it is great to know that we all share the same vision. We will resume the project next year once we have restructured the finances. In the meantime, I will miss working with Simbu and the crew.” Kollywood Selvaraghavan Kaan Also Read Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan team up for adaptation 'Devotion of Suspect X' Meet Waluscha De Sousa, Shah Rukh Khan's new leading lady Sajid plans to dedicate 'Heropanti' song to flute players Kate Hudson would wed fiancé Matt for kids", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/KAAN-2.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/KAAN-2.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151014/entertainment-kollywood/article/str-selva-combo-film-kaan-shelved", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:58:51.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
