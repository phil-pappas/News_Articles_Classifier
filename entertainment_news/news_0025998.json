In fact, Scarlett’s contemplating moving out of her parents’ home. \nAnd (understandably) we couldn’t cope with the news… Scarlett from #Gogglebox has me crying. If I was her mum she'd be home for life. #comedygold \n— Wain's World (@hungryhippo66) October 16, 2015 If Scarlett moves out, she'd better take the cameras with her. Or just go back to her mum and dad's every week to film #gogglebox \n— Laura Cooney (@cherrysodablog) October 16, 2015 \nHere are a few one-liners from tonight’s Gogglebox to remind ourselves why we want her to stay. 1.

On Prince William painting a house in DIY SOS (Channel 4 screenshot) \nSM: “Imagine someone going into to your house and saying ‘King of England painted that wall’!” 6. On a penguin feeding her young food that sort of looks like vomit in Patagonia (Channel 4 screenshot) \nSM: “That’s not cute. That’s not cute at all.” 7.
