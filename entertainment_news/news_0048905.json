She wanted to document the incident to start a paper trail in case this guy turns into a stalker. \n\"If he starts following her around and showing up where she is, then she can get an order of protection against him, but only with a paper trail.\" \nFollowing the incident at the theatre, Rust - who also threw a bouquet of roses to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' actress - was escorted out of the theatre in handcuffs, issued a summons for disorderly conduct, and released. \nKiera - who has four-month-old daughter Edie with husband James Righton - filed her police report the following day. complaint", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:24:00.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
