Online marketing and social media is largely responsible for this new phase of maturity in the publication industry.\nDallas, TX, October 20, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Crafting a compelling story with mass appeal is the the first step to becoming a national best seller. Unfortunately the road to success doesn't end there. Success is ultimately determined by the author's ability to implement effective marketing strategies for the target audience.\nDebut author A.L. Smith has taken an innovative approach to reaching her target audience through the dramatic appeal of the \"cinematic book trailer.\" Through her collaborations with up and coming cinematographer/director Huey Rawls, the Dallas based author is determined to leave her mark on the world of urban fiction. Their first cinematic production, Behind Closed Doors 2, provides a compelling glimpse into the world of familial human trafficking. Through effective online marketing and the power of social media, the trailer has been viewed over 200,000 times.
