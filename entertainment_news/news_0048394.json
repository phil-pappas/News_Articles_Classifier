(Originally published by the Daily News on John Chapman. This story was written by October 10, 1946.)\nEugene O’Neill’s “The Iceman Cometh” is a magnificent drama - magnificent in plan, in size, in scope, in depth. It is a frightening play, too - terrifying and shocking; and it’s performance by an inspired company is superb. Afternoons and evenings from now on at the Martin Beck may be seen American theatre as it should be - a powerful and moving thing, a part of life itself. A great dramatist has cut the ordinary commercial stage down to its tiny real size.\nI had a feeling yesterday afternoon and last evening that some of my neighbors at the Theatre Guild’s premiere were so busy looking for symbolism, so intent upon finding hidden meanings, so afraid they might miss the master’s message and risk being considered obtuse, that they had little time left for doing the very simple thing about the only thing an audience is supposed to do - to sit in a comfortable chair and take in a play.\nO’Neill doesn’t need any audience help to tell his story, for he is a craftsman who knows that it is his job to tell it, through his actors. It is our pipe-dreams which make us live, and when the last dream is gone there is nothing but death ahead - and Death is the Iceman of the drama. It’s as simple as that.\nFrom his own raffish past O’Neill has summoned the ghosts of the bums he knew; has bid them come alive again, from their tattered souls outward to their frayed and dirty clothing. One by one he brings them to life, hiding nothing. But in the seeming pitilessness of this exposure there is the profound pity of complete understanding.\nThe Bum of 1912.\nHe has brought these bums together as they were in 1912, putting them in the back room of a West Side saloon - some say it is Jimmy the Priest’s place - where rotgut whisky is a nickel and pipe-dreams are free.\nHere they sprawl on the iron chairs or sleep with their heads on the grubby tables. Here they cadge drinks from the proprietor, Harry Hope, who is a bum himself. Night and day make little difference to them, for the light doesn’t change much in this grimy place and liquor can be had at any time - for this is a Raines Law hotel where guests may be served at any hour.\nHarry Hope is a crotchety but warm-hearted Irishman who hasn’t set foot on the street in 20 years; hasn’t left the place since his wife died. His own pipe-dream is that some time he is going to walk out of there, see all his friends in the ward and run for the post of alderman which was offered him two decades go.\nAmong his guests:\nA former circus man, a shortchange expert who yearns for the circus days;\nNew York Daily News New York Daily News reviews Eugene O'Neill's ' Iceman Cometh' in Oct. 10, 1946 paper. A former police lieutenant, fired off the force for graft, who regards himself as the fall guy for higher-ups and is sure his name can be cleared;\nA former Harvard law student whom a family disgrace drove to drink;\n[An African American], one-time operator of a gambling joint under the protection of Big Bill Devery;\nA Boer, one-time general in the Boer War;\nHis friend and enemy, a captain of British infantry, now a remittance man;\nA former newspaper and publicity man, who is always going to straighten out and clean up tomorrow and get his job back;\nAn Anarchist editor and philosopher, now crazy;\nA former Anarchist who believes he sees all, knows all and is watching the passing parade with detachment;\nA boy on the lam from some Anarchist trouble in California,\nAnd two bartenders, one of whom has two street walkers bringing him in side money and the other of whom has one, whom he loves and some time wants to marry.\nNew York Daily News New York Daily News reviews Eugene O'Neill's ' Iceman Cometh' in Oct. 10, 1946 paper All Wait for Hickey.\nThey are, as O’Neill has drawn them and as a wonderful company plays them, a shattering picture of hope and despair - and they are far from lugubrious. Their squabbles and opinions provide some splendid humor - splendid because it derives from character and situation.\nIt takes the afternoon session of the play - a little over an hour - to set all these characters in their vivid reality, and to let us watch them as they wait for the arrival of Hickey. Hickey - Theodore Hickman - is a hardware salesman who comes to Harry Hope’s this time each year for a big drunk because it is Hope’s birthday.\nThis time it isn’t the old, joking, happy Hickey who arrives with his stories about how his wife has been entertaining the iceman. He is pleasant enough, but he is sober, and he has come with a purpose. He is evangelist, come to show the others the light. He has found happiness and he wants his friends to share it.\nThe happiness is the loss of his last remaining pipe-dream. With this gone he knows that nothing remains ahead; there are no more tomorrows and therefore he is at peace. With his cheerful salesman’s approach he nags the bums, one by one, into laying the ghosts of all their tomorrows. Harry Hope must really go out and tour his ward; Jimmy Tomorrow must get his publicity job; Willie Oban must get a law practice or a job in the D.A.’s office, and so on.\nHickey knows they’ll never make it, and tells them so. They will come back, beaten, and then their tomorrows will all be gone and they will live happily ever after.\nPipe-Dreams Return.\nBut it doesn’t work out that way. Hickey transforms a group of amiable souses into a pack of snarling enemies. The peace he promised - a peace that comes with the knowledge that only death lies ahead - fails to materialize. Harry Hope’s birthday party is a pathetic wake. Only at the last, when they learn that Hickey is insane, does the fine life return. All but two of them get their pipedream back and the whisky tastes good once more. The two who fail, die.\nI have never before seen so many exciting performances in one play. As Harry Hope, Dudley Digges is magnificent. As Hickey, James Barton gallantly carries a tremendous role, with a last-act scene in which he confesses the murder of his wife - to put her out of her misery for loving such a bum as himself - which is almost staggering in its demands. As the sideline philosopher, Carl Benton Reid is perfect.\nRuth Gilbert, Jeanne Cagney and Marcella Markham, as the streetwalkers, are funny and pathetic in turn as they tell themselves they are not whores - just tarts. Rocky Pioggi is a joy as the night bartender - and so is every last member of the company a joy.\nThe direction is by Eddie Dowling, and it is another triumph for one of the finest workmen in the theatre. The setting, by Robert Edmond Jones, is precisely right. “The Iceman Cometh” is great theatre.\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:23:16.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
