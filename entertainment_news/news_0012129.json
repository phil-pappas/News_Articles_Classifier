Next week will be an important one as far as Tamil cinema is concerned as starting from 21st there is a long weekend on the cards, thanks to Dussehra celebrations. \nFilm producers have always eyed such long weekend for obvious reasons and this time around it is Vikram 's 10 Endrathukulla and Vijay Sethupathi 's Naanum Rowdydhaan that will be benefited as both these movies will have a 5 day opening weekend. \nBoth the films are scheduled to hit the screen on October 21st (Wednesday). Interestingly, both Vikram and Vijay starrer have gathered behind them some expectations. \nThere are absolutely no doubts that both these films will have its own set of audiences but it's the word of mouth that will decide how much money these movies end up stashing at the box offices after the end of the 5 day weekend. \nOne other factor that will most likely play a huge part in deciding these films box office successes is the content of the respective film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:01:00.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
