Whether as notification provision in a vibrating smartphone, tension building in a video game controller, or input confirmation in an industrial scanner, haptics technologies have now reached billions of electronics devices. The report finds that the haptics industry will be worth $2.3bn by 2016.\n\nHaptics technology options\nThe most common of these technologies is the eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motor. Cheap, robust and very effective, this solution dominates the marketplace. However, technology development into newer forms of haptics with new and improved performance capabilities has been extensive, especially in the last decade.\n\nFrom more logical progressions such as the use of voice coils, or linear resonant actuators, into ceramic or newer polymeric piezoelectric options, right through to drastically different techniques using microfluidics, ultrasound, or electrostatics, the ecosystem of available technology is now extremely diverse.\n\nReplacing a dominant incumbent\nHowever, the challenge of replacing a cheap, reliable, and generally adequate incumbent is significant. Many companies have tried and failed to diversify into other technology areas, with the next iteration simply returning to the incumbent. However, as longer-term, carefully developed use-cases emerge, these emerging haptics will begin to find their niches and gradually see sustainable growth.\n\nThe challenge has been met head on by many of the largest companies in the world, with Apple's announcement of their Taptic module being typical of new developments that will emerge. They are backing new haptics with both financial support and product reputations.\n\nIdentifying the best application sectors\nAs the largest sector by some way, applications in consumer electronics, and particularly implementation in mobile phones, has been the area of greatest interest and investment. However, it is niche areas where haptics has been gaining sustainable momentum. The wearable technology space is one of great interest, where user experiences still require extensive improvement, and consistent skin contact puts haptics in an excellent position to be a part of this. In automotive, many of the largest manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers have dedicated haptics teams, working on ways to improve user sensation for increasingly electrified vehicle interior consoles. Finally, work in the medical space has shown how integrating different types of haptics can accelerate the education process for tactile procedures.\n\nAbout This Report \nHaptics 2015-2026: Technologies, Markets and Players provides thorough descriptions of the technology behind all of the key haptics actuators, including how they work, key players and manufacturers, and full benchmarking against competitive options. It details the key characteristics and end users in the primary vertical markets: consumer electronics (including mobile, gaming, tablet, wearables and other), automotive, medical and industrial/appliance.\n\nThe report provides detailed market forecasts from 2015-2026, including separation by actuator type, and by market sector. These forecasts are illustrated with specific case studies, and benchmarked against supplier data.\n\nFinally, the report contains a full description of the haptics value chain, including the materials suppliers, component suppliers, chip driver manufacturers, software providers, key integrators and end users. This is backed up by an extensive interview program, with interviews and profiles of the following key players in the industry: AAC Technologies, Aito, Arkema (Piezotech), Artificial Muscle Inc. (part of Parker Hannifin ), Bluecom Co. Ltd, General Vibration, Immersion Corporation, Jahwa Electronics, KOTL - Jinlong Machinery, LG Innotek, Nidec Corporation, Novasentis, Precision Microdrives, Redux Labs, SEMCO, Solvay , Tectus Technologies and Ultrahaptics Ltd.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03273456-summary/view-report.html \n\nAbout Reportlinker \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
