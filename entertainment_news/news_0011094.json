In a sailor suit. On a table. Congratulations, it's your birthday! Channing's sailor dance starts around the 1:12 mark, but you should watch the rest of the trailer because (1) this movie looks ridiculous and amazing and (2) Scarlett Johansson also appears as a mermaid. Maybe if they ever make a third ​Magic Mike ​, Channing will find a way to recycle this costume and these moves. Something tells me the Kings of Tampa could do a lot with \"In the Navy.\"\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail ​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x259/placeholder_gallery-1444411939-channing.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/placeholder_1444411939-channing.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x259/gallery-1444411939-channing.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444411939-channing.gif", "http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:45:52.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
