New York City police recruits to watch a play for training FILE - In this July 19, 2004 file photo, former Secretary of Defense William Cohen and his wife Janet Langhart Cohen arrive for the world premiere of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" in New York. New York's Police Academy has added the one-act play “Anne & Emmett” by Janet Langhart Cohen to its recruit training this fall. The play is an imaginary conversation between Anne Frank, who died in a Nazi concentration camp, and Emmett Till, who was killed by a racist mob in Mississippi in 1955. The play will be performed for some 1,100 recruits at their academy in Queens over two performances on Thursday, part of a push by the department to prepare future police officers to overcome community mistrust and their own bias.
