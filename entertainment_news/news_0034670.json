The Rochester area has a truckload of different pickup providers to choose from. We did a quick newsroom survey to find out which providers everyone used and how much they paid for their trash pickup each year. We found a wide variety of responses in price and providers, and now we want to ask you.\nFill out this form with your town name, garbage provider and how much you pay. The Democrat and Chronicle will use the information to build a pinpoint map for a future story, which will display what residents pay for refuse hauling around town.\nPlease include your phone number if youâ€™re willing to be contacted by a reporter for this story. Your phone number and address will not be published.\nSTADDEO@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/DC_garbage"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:05:06.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
