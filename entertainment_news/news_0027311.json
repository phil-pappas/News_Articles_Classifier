A former investment banker, Llano is the founder of Source One Distributors, Inc., a corporation providing equipment, products, and support services to the defense industry. In 2012, Llano also created Serket Racing, an auto racing team devoted to raising awareness and direct support for veterans and their families. He was the first citizen of the city of Wellington, Fla., to be awarded the \"Key to the City\" for his charitable efforts for veterans across the United States, and the retired Marine continues to inspire others through his vast philanthropic work nationwide.\n\"It is an incredible opportunity for Boot Campaign to have Mark join our Board and be able to tap into his military background and years of expertise in developing and growing successful businesses,\" says Boot Campaign CEO Robyn Payne. \"An entrepreneur of his caliber brings years of knowledge and experience to the Board that will help us continue to grow and provide great direction for Boot Campaign.\"\n\"Mark brings great expertise in of building organizations from an idea, executive-level coaching, and mentoring standpoint,\" adds Leigh Ann Ranslem, Boot Campaign Board of Directors. \"His skills include overcoming obstacles one step at a time until the goal is met and, of course, fast driving. Mark is a true patriot and we are privileged to welcome him to our Board!\"\nSeeking to serve his country and help others, the Tampa, Fla. native joined the Marine Corps Reserve in 1988 and served in the Gulf War until May 1991. Llano's dedication to excellence was apparent as a Marine, and upon leaving the service, continued with the entrepreneurial work he pursued that brought him closer to his military family.\nFollowing active duty, Llano completed his criminology at University of South Florida and moved into investment banking. He ultimately started an investment group, growing the company from three employees to more than 600 across all 50 U.S. states and seven international offices.\nShortly thereafter, Llano started Source One Distributors, Inc., which has been recognized for being a leader in military and tactical gear distribution. Source One has enjoyed multiple years of $200 million in top line revenue and won a $10 billion contract with the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to provide mission critical gear to the Department of Defense. Most recently, Source One was featured in U.S. Veterans Magazine, making it onto the Top Veteran Owned Businesses list.\nIn 2012, Llano married his success with Source One and his passion for auto racing by creating Serket Racing, a Porsche racing team dedicated to raising awareness and direct support for veterans and their families with every race and every win. The team owner and driver saw an immediate parallel between the adrenaline of a warrior and the thrill of the racetrack. From its creation, the Serket Racing team found success in both the racing industry and the veteran community. In its first season alone, Serket Racing donated to over 11 veteran organizations and ended the season with a standing ovation from fellow competitors and fans, showing the admiration Serket Racing had gained in the racing industry.\nIn just three short years, Serket Racing has worked with incredible partners, such as Boot Campaign, Kaplan University, Crye Precision, and Wells Fargo to change the lives of veterans nationwide, issuing more than 250 educational scholarships, donating three homes to struggling veterans, and giving away thousands of dollars in the struggle to solve America’s veteran crisis. Among those activities, Llano recently welcomed the Boot Campaign team and five amazing veterans to the Watkins Glen racetrack for a weekend of immense appreciation and honor.

He's hosted events and been a long-time supporter and ambassador of Boot Campaign, and we couldn’t be more pleased to have him join our Board and help shape our future.\"\nAbout Boot Campaign\nEstablished in 2009, Boot Campaign is a national 501(c)(3) charitable organization dedicated to promoting patriotism for America and our military community; raising awareness of the unique challenges service members face during and post-service; and providing assistance to military personnel, past and present, and their families.
