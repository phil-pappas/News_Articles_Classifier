Shares of SpiceJet zoomed 19.94 per cent to settle at Rs 37.30 — its 52-week high on BSE. Jet Airways climbed 12.25 per cent to end at Rs 369.70. During the day, it surged 13.67 per cent to Rs 374.40.

In the broader market, the benchmark BSE Sensex ended 57.58 points or 0.21 per cent down at 26,846.53. \nModified Date: October 13, 2015 6:00 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:21:12.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
