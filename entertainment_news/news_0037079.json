AC drives, which are primarily used to control the speed and torque of electric motors, provide optimized energy use, and reduce related costs. Advantages of energy save and long life of the equipment making AC drives increasingly popular. They also help in reducing production costs, improve production quality, and reduce Co2 emissions. \n\nThe global AC drives market is estimated at USD 14.6 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach USD 21.0 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2015 to 2020. The market has been classified on the basis of voltage, power rating, application, end-use industry, and region, which has been further divided on the basis of countries. \n\nThe study has profiled leading market players of the industry, along with their recent developments and other strategic industry activities. Some of the key players include ABB Ltd. ( Switzerland ), Siemens AG ( Germany ), Danfoss Group ( Denmark ), Schneider Electric SE ( France ), Mitsubishi Electric co. Ltd ( Japan ), Rockwell Automation (U.S.) and Yaskawa Electric Co.( Japan ).\n\nAsia-Pacific leads the AC drives system market with share of approximately 42.6% in 2015, which is expected to grow with a CAGR of 8.8% during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to the increasing government mandates to conserve electricity via energy efficiency norms and rapidly growing industrialization in this region. \n\nBased on end-use industry, AC drives market has been broadly classified into oil & gas, water & wastewater, power generation, building automation, food & beverage, metals & mining, chemicals & petrochemicals and others. Water & wastewater industry is expected to grow at a highest CAGR of 8.4% from 2015-2020.\n\nThe low voltage drives segment accounted for the largest market share in 2014. Its growth has been attributed to the usage of low voltage motors in various industries globally. However medium voltage AC drives is expected to register a higher growth rate during the forecast period.\n\nIn the methodology various secondary sources have been taken into consideration including annual reports, press releases, investor presentations of companies, white papers and certified publications, articles from recognized authors from association panels, manufacturers associations, directories, and databases.
