A college degree is a means used by many to increase their salary potentials and marketability. In Hollywood, however, the university path is less necessary. \nMany Hollywood actors attended, for at least a time, prestigious universities. But, for a variety of reasons, such as pursuing their now-illustrious careers or simply not enjoying the college experience, they dropped out. \nGenerally speaking, college graduates are less likely to experience unemployment than their peers without a diploma, but these celebrities have definitely defied the odds. They’ve gone on to become some of the wealthiest, most successful people in the world without the help of a college education. \nCurious about which of your favorite celebrities tried their hand at college, but eventually bowed out?
