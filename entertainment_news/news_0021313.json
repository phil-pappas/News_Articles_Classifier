She is also an owner of the OWN cable network - a media outlet that distributes programming based on her sensibilities - through a joint venture between her Harpo Productions and Discovery Communications. Through a partnership with Hearst Corp., Winfrey publishes \"O,\" a magazine with a similar mission. The inspirational figure rose to larger fame with the syndicated talk-show she hosted for 25 seasons between 1986 and 2011.\n\"Weight Watchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" said Winfrey, in a prepared statement. As part of the pact, Winfrey, whose efforts to maintain a healthy weight have long been scrutinized, will become a member of the Weight Watchers program.\n\"Through our conversations, it became clear that there is tremendous alignment between Oprah's intention and our mission,\" \"aid Jim Chambers, Weight Watchers' chief executive, in a statement. \"We believe that her remarkable ability to connect and inspire people to realize their full potential is uniquely complementary to our powerful community, extraordinary coaches and proven approach.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:15:32.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
