To ensure those dollars stay in the community and stimulate growth, the school board developed policy-giving preferences to large contractors that pledge to subcontract with women- and minority-owned firms, referred to generally as WMBEs.\nOn Aug. 19, the board’s capital improvement committee was told about $26 million from the second education sales tax, ESPLOST II, had gone to women- and minority-owned firms.\nBill Huttinga of Parsons, the school district’s education sales tax construction project manager, presented the committee with a list of women and minority subcontractors who have benefited from ongoing construction at Hodge, Hesse, Heard, Isle of Hope, Coastal, Islands and Rice Creek schools.\n“I count up to 50 firms, and that’s a nice number,” Huttinga said. “ESPLOST is having a significant impact on these companies and on the economy.”\nThe problem was — almost immediately — subcontractors began to complain the numbers were inflated.\nHuttinga said he would go back over the numbers and ask for verification documents. But his second report generated even more questions about WMBE reporting accuracy.\nNumbers game\nOn Sept. 16 Huttinga presented the school board’s capital improvement committee with a follow-up WMBE participation report.\n“The green highlighted (report) is an update of what we passed out last month,” Huttinga told board members. “Since this was passed out last month, we have been spending a lot of time on this.”\nHuttinga said he had gone back to the companies that manage the school construction projects — known as construction managers at risk or “CMRs” — and “have required that they update their reports and that they verify their numbers with us and provide us with what they see as their final numbers.”\nThe second report was markedly different than the first.\nFive WMBE subcontractors, who initially were reported as receiving contracts totalling $772,259, were nowhere to be found on the second list. Among them was Champion Fire Protection which, as it turns out, is not owned by women or minorities.\nAlso, 10 WMBE firms originally listed as receiving $9.6 million in contract awards were down to $7.5 million on the second list, marking an initial overstatement of $2.1 million.\nThe originally listed contract awards to Willie J. Harswell and W & W Custom Cabinets were double what they should have been, and the originally reported contract award to William Henry Trucking was quadrupled.\nHuttinga said the William Henry contract award was overstated because of a clerical error on his part.\n“When I do reports, things sometimes get duplicated when reports are merged,” he said.\nBut not all of the discrepancies were clerical duplications. In fact, Huttinga said William Henry was the only one. Other discrepancies, he said, were because of last minute contract changes.\n“Sometimes subcontractors do more and sometimes they do less than expected. One subcontractor might get replaced with another subcontractor when it comes time to do the job, and that is another reason for the change,” Huttinga said. “…work scopes change and new names drop on and off the list as a result, or the agreements the subcontractors have can change if the vendor or subcontractor can’t perform the work.”\nBut the bulk of the problem is lazy reporting, he said.\n“People get lazy and can keep reporting the same numbers. But once the report was published people got serious,” Huttinga said. “The change from the original list to the second one has a lot to do with that fact.”\nFuzzy math\nThere is no easy way to minimize the shifts in WMBE contract awards that occur throughout the building program, according to Huttinga, because the construction managers often base their monthly WMBE participation numbers on prospective subcontractor lists.\n“This information comes from CMRs when they first set up their (guaranteed maximum price), so consequently these are commitments, these are purchase orders, these are contracts,” Huttinga said. “They update as we go through the program.”\nBut the shift between Huttinga’s first WMBE participation report and the update is significant.\nHuttinga’s second report includes 15 WMBE subcontractors whose contract awards increased by $2.3 million from the first. Additionally, the second report includes nine WMBE subcontractors with contracts totaling $1.7 million who were not on the first report at all.\nThose include Huttinga’s own minority partners, Savannah businessman Sylvester Formey and Savannah Alderman Estella Shabazz with their company called Vanguard.\nHuttinga denied adding new minority contractors, including those on his staff, to downplay the differences between the two lists.\nHe said his previous reports only included WMBE subcontractors on school construction projects. But when he compiled the more detailed list for September, he thought it was appropriate to add the $702,717 contract with his WMBE partners.\nIn the future, he said, he may also add the minority business partners of project architects as well.\nHuttinga also insisted the second list was never meant to be a correction of the first one. He said they are evolving documents — the first list detailing WMBE construction subcontractors through Aug. 1 and the second detailing WMBE construction subcontractors and Parsons program management minority partners through Sept. 1.\nAny new names on the list are newly hired subcontractors, he said.\n“This wasn’t a correction of the first list,” he said. “One was for August, and one was September.”\nAfter realizing both lists were labeled August 2015, Huttinga followed up with this statement.\n“Sometimes we shoot ourselves in the foot by not paying attention to detail. I was wondering why you were questioning the dates of the reports, so I took a look,” Huttinga said. “I don’t think this is the best way to identify the reports, and we will make a change.\n“I think a better way is the first one is ‘August 2015 CIC Report’ and the second one should be ‘September 2015 CIC Report,’ and we will go on each month accordingly. Trying to identify them by an update date is not the best way because the first one was the publish date — not the data date — and the second one was the data date — not the publish date. Sorry about the confusion.”\nGood intentions\nSome district officials had their own questions about Huttinga’s reports.\n“When we receive a document, we expect it to be accurate unless it says it’s a draft...,” board member Julie Wade commented during Huttinga’s presentation. “How confident are you that this is actually correct now?”\nAs construction projects are completed, Huttinga said, he will follow up to ensure the WMBE subcontractor payouts align with the reported contract amounts. In the meantime, he said, the fact the discrepancies were revealed is a good thing because it forces everyone to do a better job of reporting.\n“The report is working,” he said. “This has brought new awareness to this program, which, in the end, can only produce fair and honest results.”\nAnd, Huttinga said, the discrepancies are minimal when you look at the big picture. ESPLOST II construction contracts worth $90 million have been awarded, he said, and the discrepancies in WMBE reporting only amount to about $3 million.\n“The change is minimal when you look at the bottom line,” Huttinga said. “The bottom line at least is quite accurate, and the overall impact to the program has not significantly changed.”\nBut many of the WMBE subcontractors say their bottom line is small enough for the discrepancy to be significant.\n“I’m just glad my numbers on the second report are right,” said William Henry Trucking owner Asa Nails, who confirmed he received about $337,888 in contracts to haul construction debris, not the $1.2 million originally reported.\nDistrict officials, who plan to ask voters to approve a third education sales tax in the coming months, are eager to appease critics and assure the public that their WMBE policy is working as intended. That includes getting accurate numbers.\n“We are determined to get the report right,” said school board member Connie Hall, who has been the most vocal about accurate reporting and developing a strong policy to ensure the inclusion of local, women and minority businesses.\nTo ensure that accuracy, school officials say they have officially assigned an auditor to verify ESPLOST contract expenditures, particularly the self-reported WMBE participation numbers.\n“A senior auditor will be reviewing all of the figures so we will be able to enter the ESPLOST III process assured that participation numbers are correct,” Hall said.\nWomen & Minority Business Enterprise as of August 2015\nThe first detailed education sales tax funded MWBE construction contract award list was released by Parsons on Aug. 19, 2015. The list was updated and re-released on Sept. 16 after WMBE firms complained that the numbers were overstated. Although both lists show that WMBE subcontractors have received about $26 million in work, some companies were removed from or added to the updated list; and the award amounts of some companies that appear on both lists experienced increases and decreases.
