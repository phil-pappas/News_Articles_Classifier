Photo: Nine \nDespite rumours Karl Stefanovic is contemplating his television future, the Nine network has confirmed The Verdict , his prime-time panel show, is to be extended .\nNews reports at the weekend claimed Stefanovic, who has hosted Nine's Today  for 11 years, reported for 60 Minutes on a regular basis and is now fronting The Verdict , was exhausted by the workload and looking for a change.\nThose supposedly close to the star were quoted as saying the early morning workload was too much, hinted at a strained relationship with his Today co-host Lisa Wilkinson (unlikely according to those close to the pair), and said it was believed Stefanovic was looking for a regular prime-time television job.\nKarl Stefanovic on the Today set with Lisa Wilkinson.
