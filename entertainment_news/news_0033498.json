It's too bad Hakeem's girl group Mirage à Trois didn't pan out, because this episode could really have used some more choreography montages. Spoilers ahead!\n Marisa Tomei Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox More From Cosmopolitan Mimi Whiteman returns! Now that she owns part of Empire, she gets to lead board meetings and stand around at video shoots offering useless advice that people have to listen to because she's rich. I can't wait for the day she crumbles under the weight of Cookie's disdain.\nAndre Royo Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox If you pay him enough, Thurston \"Thirsty\" Rawlings will do literally anything for you — get you out of jail, handle your publicity, answer your phone calls, and help you dig up the corpse of your childhood friend that your son's wife killed by accident. Gee, wonder why they call him Thirsty? But in all seriousness, if your lawyer carries around a portable \"basic corpse detection system\" and you're not a character on ​Empire ​, it might be time to find a new lawyer.\nKelly Rowland Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox Once again, Kelly is onscreen for about two seconds in a flashback, trying to prevent Child Services from taking young Lucious/Dwight away from her. Clearly this plot is supposed to explain why Lucious is the way he is, but given his complete lack of sympathy for Andre in the present, it kind of just makes him look like more of an asshole.\nAdam Busch Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox Buffy 's Warren Meers appeared as an artist/photographer commissioned to do a portrait of Jamal for his ​Rolling Stone ​cover. Jamal's boyfriend was worried that they were getting too flirty, but he really shouldn't fret because this dude won't have any time for romance once Shepard Fairey sues the pants off him.\nVernon's Corpse Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox What do you know, Thirsty's basic corpse detection system works! Hope he's got a patent on that thing.\nCookie's Moschino Share Tweet Pin E-mail Fox I mean.
