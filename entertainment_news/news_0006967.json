It is unusual in that the chorus is integrated into the plot and the god (Dionysus) is not a distant presence, but rather the protagonist of the play. \nHerbold holds degrees in theater and English from Stanford University; the Max Reinhardt Seminar; the University of California, Berkeley; and the University of Maine. She and her Senior College students will read and dramatize this most chilling of Greek tragedies that is most appropriate for Halloween season, but not for children. \nAdmission is free. For more information, call 338-2006. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
