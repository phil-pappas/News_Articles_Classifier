Then Easton decided to verbalize a desire that had been a silent wish for so long. \n“Basically I put out about a year ago that me and my partner Ray (Thomas Jr.) wanted to have a song be more on a national scale as opposed to just locally,” he says. “So I put out a year ago that I wanted to record a song and have it on Billboard. I didn’t know how it was going to happen, but I just put it out that we wanted to do that as a team.” \nThe two started the production company PSboys nearly two years ago after putting the Pure Star Movement on hiatus. Pure Star toured and recorded for several years, but as members got married and started families, the touring lost some of its appeal even though the group wanted to keep a hand in the production side. \nThe PSboys worked with artists throughout the country, but the project that turned Easton’s stated goal into into an accomplished mission belonged to local artist Amar’rae Hill and his choir True Foundation when the album “We Are Royalty” debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard Gospel chart and peaked at No. 16 in August and September. Easton and Thomas produced the songs, “King” and “The Cry,” two of the album’s 10 tracks, and Thomas mastered the entire project. \nHill was born in Gary and has lived in South Bend since 2007. It’s been a long road for Hill, who cracked the charts after his first three projects fell short. He says patience was the factor that made “We Are Royalty” a success. \n“We took our time,”Hill says. “I worked on this record from 2012 to 2014.” \nThomas shares that assessment. \n“‘King’ is that one we spent time on and made sure every part of the production was on point,” Thomas says. “Everything from the live drums, live guitars, is something that we put some time in on that one. \n“I’ve noticed that a lot of artists (feel that they) need to put things out right away and that is one of the reasons why the music market is saturated. But making the Billboard chart speaks for itself.” \nEaston says having production credits on a project that reached the Top 20 on the Billboard charts gives the PSboys added credibility. \n“When we built this, we wanted respect, No. 1, and to be taken seriously,” Easton says. “So when you start to get things like that, people see your brand and see the progression that we have made and take us more seriously.” \nThe three add that the album’s success is also the result of the connections that they have made with industry insiders and with fans. Hill says that touring created a demand for the album among fans. \nHill also believes that his writing became more honest and heartfelt. “The 10 tracks on this album all come from a place of testimony because I really believe in writing songs that tell a story with the outcome of the story being victory,” he says. \n“KIng” is a praise and worship song with a contemporary Christian feel, while “The Cry” fuses modern R&B with rock-infused guitars and sports a lyrical narrative of a believer crying out to God for help and deliverance. \nBoth Thomas and Easton say that their years of going to and playing in the church, along with the time they spent touring, performing and drawing from a variety of musical influences served them well when working on “We Are Royalty.” \n“Talking to industry people and sitting down and soaking up knowledge from executives and artists helped, and the church is definitely my home base and that is where I am grounded and rooted,” Easton says. \nThomas agrees and says the gospel music training that he received as boy became the foundation when he started exploring other genres as a teenager. \n“At about 13 or 14, I started listening to (everything from) Billy Preston and Guns and Roses, and now, looking back, if somebody wants to do a rock project, I have listened to it and absorbed it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:31:19.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
