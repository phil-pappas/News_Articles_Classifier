And taken a potential franchise down with it. \nAs a prequel to the beloved J. M. Barrie story that was famously given a Disney animated treatment in 1953, Pan was intended to kick-start a new series of movies about the boy from Neverland. But after scathing reviews and a dismal opening weekend – the movie has made a paltry $17 million at the domestic box office, against a reported production budget of $150 million – the likelihood of Warner Bros. pursuing a sequel is about the same as learning how to fly just by thinking happy thoughts. \nThere have been plenty of bad movies that have sunk their respective franchises after three or four instalments, but it takes a special kind of awful to kill a potential series of films right out of the gate. Here are half a dozen other movies that killed their chances of sequels faster than a crocodile chomping off Capt. Hook’s hand. \nThe Last Airbender (2010) \nThe first season of Nickelodeon’s excellent animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender was the basis for this live-action adaptation by M. Night Shyamalan, and the plan was to produce more movies based on later seasons of the show. But the film was so astonishingly awful – even by Shyamalan standards – that talk of sequels was quickly silenced. Shyamalan recently said he still plans to do another Airbender movie, but we’ll believe that when we see a studio willing to bankroll it. \nGodzilla (1998) \nJapan’s undisputed king of the monsters made a solid comeback in 2014 with a reboot movie directed by Gareth Edwards, who will be behind the camera for next year’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. But this cheesy late-’90s revival starring Matthew Broderick was so badly panned that the planned-for sequel – which would have had Godzilla’s kids battling a giant insect in Australia – was quickly shelved. It’s probably for the best. \nDaredevil (2003) \nWe’re stoked to see a grizzled, growling Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader in next year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but even diehard Affleck fans have to admit his previous attempt at a playing a comic book superhero was pretty damn bad. (Mind you, not as bad as the 2005 spinoff Elektra, starring Affleck’s now-estranged wife Jennifer Garner.) But since the Daredevil series on Netflix has done justice to the blind crimefighter, all is forgiven. For now. \nThe Golden Compass (2007) \nThis fantasy adventure based on the first novel in the His Dark Materials trilogy wasn’t an outright dud, but it didn’t perform well enough for New Line Cinema to justify producing sequels based on the other two books in the series, much to the disappointment of director Chris Weitz. Don’t fret for star Daniel Craig, though – he seems to be doing OK in another franchise, something about a British spy with a licence to kill. \nMac and Me (1988) \nThis blatant E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial ripoff was bad enough on its own, but the awful McDonald’s tie-ins just made it that much worse. The movie ended with the words “We’ll be back!” superimposed on the screen, but the whole film was so critically reviled that the sequel was quickly cancelled. Nowadays, Mac and Me is most famous for that clip of the wheelchair kid rolling off a cliff, which Paul Rudd uses whenever he’s promoting a new movie. \nFantastic Four (2015) \nWe had high hopes for this year’s cinematic reboot of Marvel Comics’ original superhero team, but the movie was shredded by critics and ignored by audiences, and has only made $56 million at the domestic box office since opening in early August. Fox still has tentative plans for a 2017 sequel, but we think the bad taste will linger too long to make it feasible. That said, we’re much more likely to see Fantastic Four 2 before we see another Pan. Sorry, Tinker Bell.
