Carter said Quaid and his wife also face felony charges for failing to appear at a November 2010 court hearing while out on bail.\n“I probably will get arrested for all that. I’m perfectly willing to face all that stuff,” Quaid told The Associated Press. “I would like to have the issues in Santa Barbara resolved so I can move on with my life.”\nQuaid was arrested in Montreal last May after becoming the subject of a nationwide arrest warrant when he stopped checking in with the Canada Border Services Agency.\nSporting a massive beard and shoulder-length grey hair, Quaid apologized at a subsequent Immigration and Refugee Board hearing and suggested he was ready to return to the United States to deal with an outstanding legal case and ultimately return to Canada.\nQuaid, who has been living in Montreal since January 2013, was released after that arrest. His father-in-law posted $10,000 bail and he was required to respect a host of other conditions that included checking in with border-agency officials every two weeks.\nAfter arriving in Canada in 2010, the Quaids lived in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa before moving to Montreal.\nThe actor’s bid for permanent residency in Canada was denied in late 2012 and he told the hearing in May he vanished out of fear of being separated from his wife, whose father is Canadian and enabled her to gain her citizenship.\nQuaid is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid and is best-known for his roles in films such as “National Lampoon’s Vacation” and “Independence Day.”\nHe won a Golden Globe award for his depiction of President Lyndon Baines Johnson in a TV movie in the late 1980s.\nHe was also nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actor for his role in 1973’s “The Last Detail,” which starred Jack Nicholson.\nQuaid lost out to John Houseman for his performance in “The Paper Chase.”\n— With files from The Associated Press\nNote to readers: This is a corrected version.
