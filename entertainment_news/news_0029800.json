The engaged couple, according to the publication, took a long time in a photo booth and exposed their private parts in the printed pictures. The incident allegedly happened when the pair visited a swanky Beverly Hills club. Both Robert and FKA twigs entered an old-fashioned photo booth at the club and began taking off their clothes behind the curtain. Meanwhile, a line of people waiting to use the machine formed outside. The publication quoted a so-called \"insider\" as saying that the pair were \"holed up for about 15 minutes when someone yelled through the curtain, 'Hey! You gonna be in there much longer?' Barked Rob: 'Probably!' \" However, Robert and FKA twigs didn't come out immediately from the booth. According to the source, the people in line previously didn't know who were in the photo booth. They came to realize that it was the \" Twilight \" actor and FKA twigs who used the photo booth after the outside slot printed picture strips. The picture strips allegedly showed both of them engaging in \"X-rated shenanigans\" including her topless and \"him flashing his bum.\" The publication didn't specify when the incident happened. A source close to the couple told Gossip Cop that the report about the nude pictures was \"completely fabricated.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:50.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
