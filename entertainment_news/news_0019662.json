The actor was arrested on Wednesday, September 30 in Saratoga Springs, New York for domestic violence. Brendon, who played Xander Harris on the show, got into a fight with a girlfriend and allegedly choked her. Per The Associated Press, Saratoga Spring Police Lt. Bob Jillson said Brendon faced charges of felony third-degree robbery, misdemeanor obstruction of breathing and two criminal mischief counts. \"Last night around 11:30 P.M., we got called to a nice family-owned hotel in town for a reported domestic disturbance,\" Bob Jillson, Investigations Lieutenant at Saratoga Springs Police Department, told PEOPLE. \"We got to the room and we found a 33-year-old female there by herself, and she reported that she had been in a domestic incident with Nick, and he had subsequently left before we got there. She did not have any physical injuries that we were aware of.\" The woman told officers she intended to return several belongings to Brendon and was about to leave when he objected, took her car keys, smashed her cell phone and started choking her. Brendon was found a few blocks away from the hotel and was immediately arrested. \"He was placed under arrest without any incident,\" said Jillson. Brendon posted a $20,000 bond and was released from jail on Thursday. The troubled actor got headlines mostly for his multiple arrests. In October 2014, he was arrested for creating disturbance at a hotel in Boise, Idaho. In March this year he was arrested in Tallahassee, Florida for trashing a hotel room. Two months later police charged him with public intoxication after plucking him from Myrtle Beach. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:37:40.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
