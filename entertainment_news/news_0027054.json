I was told recently about a bell that had been salvaged from a church in Newfoundland and shipped to a needy church somewhere overseas. I haven't be able to find out much about the bell. Please help. Also, what happened to the old Tobyhanna Methodist Church in the Village of Tobyhanna? D.B., Stroud Township The salvaged bell, which has captured your interest, once hung in the tower of the German Valley Moravian Church. During the early 1960s, the church, which had been closed for several years, was demolished. Its 1909 cornerstone and its contents were sent to Bethlehem and the bell was placed into storage. Around the same time, the Ballard's Valley Moravian Church in Watson Hill, Jamaica, needed a bell but lacked the funds to make the purchase. Filling that church's need, the Newfoundland Moravian Church congregation, to which former German Valley Church members belonged, had the bell refurbished and shipped in 1965 to the Rev. H.T. Cuthbert, who served the Jamaican church as minister. The bell arrived in Jamaica after being crated in Newfoundland by Robert Robacker, transported to Scranton by Carroll Fetherman, trucked to New York City and then taken by boat to the island. The \"profound, immeasurable appreciation\" of the mission congregation and leaders in Jamaica seems to point out that the decision to donate the bell was the correct one, according to a 1965 article in The Pocono Record. To answer your second question: The century-old Tobyhanna Methodist Church was destroyed by fire in the morning hours of Feb. 25, 1965, burning it to the ground within an hour. After the fire, services were held at St. Ann’s Roman Catholic Church in Tobyhanna and the Tobyhanna Army Depot Chapel until a new church was built.
