Photo: Louise Kennerley \nAcoustic Chamber is a large, white shell-like sculpture perched over the ocean, with the sound of the waves whistling through a curved space travelling up and out through its centre. \nIt's a delicate presence edging over the coastline, a clean, graceful structure to which visitors are encouraged to step up to and listen in.\nAnd one of the unlikely inspirations behind the work? An underground carpark.  \nMatthew Asimakis, Clarence Lee and Caitlin Roseby with their sculpture 'Half Gate'. Photo: Louise Kennerley \nScience and architecture student Arissara​ Reed, 24, says hearing the wind move through the relatively mundane setting of a carpark one day made her think about using acoustics to transform a space, building on her fascination with sound.\nAdvertisement \"I like the idea of people being able to experience a space in a different way, through something that you've interjected into a form,\" she says. \"I don't think people come to a landscape to listen to the landscape, and I really want people to listen and to encourage that.\"\nHer collaborator, Davin Nurimba , a 20-year-old architecture student at the University of Sydney, says their idea was to create a site-specific work close to Tamarama Beach.\n\"This was the spot that we felt connected to, with the ocean waves coming in,\" he says. \"We branched our research out based off that origin, trying to find forms that would work with the idea of working with the sound of the ocean – that immersive experience of having people reconnect with the landscape in a way that the senses are amplified.\"\n \n \nOn Wednesday, the day before the official launch of the 19th Sculpture by the Sea, the pair admit it's \"unreal\" that their piece features as part of the 107 works lining the coast between Bondi and Tamarama. \n Along with two other groups, they are recipients of a $10,000 scholarship, the Clitheroe Foundation Emerging Sculptor Mentorships, which supports funds for exhibiting and pairs the artists with a mentor for a year. \nCaitlin Roseby, 21, Matthew Asimakis, 23, and Clarence Lee, 21, are also architecture students at the University of Sydney and scholarship winners.\nTheir work, Half Gate , is an imposing steel and concrete structure taking over the lookout at the bottom of Marks Park at Tamarama. Once people step inside the enclosure, it reveals a dazzling display of mirrors mixing sky and sea. \n\"I think the fact that we really made an effort to create a work that spoke to the environment it was going to be placed in was something that spoke to the people who curate the exhibition,\" Asimakis says.\nSculpture by the Sea, which drew 520,000 visitors last year, will feature the work of 118 artists: 79 from Australia and 39 from overseas. \nThe winner of the $60,000 Macquarie Sculpture Prize will be announced on Thursday morning as the exhibition is officially launched.\nThe students will continue working with their assigned mentors beyond the exhibition: Reed and Nurimba are working with a German artist, Lukas Kuhne, who lives in Uruguay, while Roseby and colleagues are working with Sydney artist Janet Laurence.\nAs Asimakis checks the sculpture's location on Wednesday, he says it's an overwhelming experience to see the group's work move from a paper design to a real structure.\n\"It is amazing,\" he says. \"Amazing is the word. I think we're still getting used to it.\"\nSculpture by the Sea runs until November 8, see sculpturebythesea.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:28:38.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
