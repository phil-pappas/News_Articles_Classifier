The actress and model is charged with cheating Haj pilgrims of over Rs 2 crore through her travel agency according to a report in The Hindu . This is not the first time that Maria Susairaj has been a part of a criminal investigation. In 2008, she was apparently in the list of suspects along with Neeraj Grover, a TV producer charged in a murder case. She was sent to jail to serve a term of three years for destroying evidence. The Ahmedabad Crime Branch initiated action against the model after they received a complaint from La-Raib travel agency based in Vadodara. Susairaj had promised to supply La-Raib travel agency with 1,200 travel tickets for Haj pilgrims through Parapan Tours, her travel agency based in Mumbai. But, she failed to produce any tickets and was absconding. The fraud was committed in February 2015 according to R N Patel, Inspector at Vadodara. Susairaj approached Haj operators who were seeking discounts on bulk bookings for Haj travelers. Susairaj sealed the deal promising Rs 4000 discount per ticket so La-Raib went ahead with the deal. Susairaj is currently in custody of the Vadodara Crime Branch till the case can be investigated. \n 23 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:17:27.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
