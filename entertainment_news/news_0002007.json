Seeing her with two adorable, wrinkly bulldog faces is almost too much, and the second puppy is an exotic blue color bulldog puppy!\nShrinkabull's Abe Ward and Ann Ward (Anndrea) brought the latest puppy personally to Azalea's fianc√©'s, Nick Young (of the LA Lakers), pad in Los Angeles on September 1, 2014. Iggy was also given a photo book featuring her bulldog puppy complete with photos from birth to 9 weeks old and her new puppy's parents (mother Shrinkabull Bella and father Shrinkabull's Jax) and grandparents Shrinkabulls Blue Legacy & Shrinkabulls Ace In The Hole. Iggy loved the new addition to her family and couldn't stop talking about her new blue bulldog puppy's cute, wrinkly face.\nWhat's this new exotic blue AKC English bulldog's name? Azalea finally made the big reveal on Twitter: Shrinkabull Space Jam. So, to date, she has Shrinkabull Jam Don't Shake It Like That Jelli and Shrinkabull Space Jam. What will her next pet be & what she will name it? Time will tell, but it will probably have \"Jam\" in the title.\nTo learn more about Shrinkabull's or to get your very own cute English bulldog like Iggy's, please visit: http://www.shrinkabulls.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:46:16.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
