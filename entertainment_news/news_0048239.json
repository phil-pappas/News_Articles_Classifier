Mendes took to Instagram earlier this week to share his take on the Biebs' latest hit \"What Do You Mean?\". The budding singer's face is nowhere to be seen in the clip, which unfortunately is very short. He's only heard flawlessly singing a few lines of the song over acoustic guitar riffs. A video posted by Shawn Mendes (@shawnmendes) on Sep 29, 2015 at 2:01pm PDT Last month, Bieber pissed off Mendes' fans when he said he had no idea who the 17-year-old singer was. \"Who's Shawn Mendes?\" he replied when asked if he had advice for Mendes, who also hailed from Canada. A few days later, Bieber let everyone know he found out about Mendes and liked his music. He gave him a shout-out while helping promote the teen's own hit \"Stitches\" via Instagram. \"Shawn I checked out the music and I'm so proud! So glad to see another boy from Canada crushin it. #canadiansdoitbetter,\" he said at that time. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:11.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
