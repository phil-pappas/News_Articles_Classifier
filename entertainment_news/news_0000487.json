All films are shown at 7 p.m. in the first-floor Abbott Room of the library, 106 High St. \nThe screenings are free and open to the public. For the month of October, the films will touch on the theme of death and dying, as an early bow to National Hospice Month in November. \nThe first film in the month is a comedy, “Death at a Funeral” (2007, US/Germany/UK/Netherlands), on Oct. 9. Although later remade with an American cast, critics agreed the original is funnier, especially as it was made by the creative energies of Frank Oz. It begins as an ensemble piece showing an upper-middle class British family coming together for the funeral of the patriarch at the family home. What starts as a formal affair quickly shows the cracks in the family's relationships in a comedy of manners and eccentricity as only the Brits can do it. \nThe remaining films are more serious, human dramas: “Amour” (2012, France/Germany/Austria) on Oct. 23; and “My Life Without Me” “My Life Without Me” (2003, Canada/Spain) on Oct. 30. For information on Friday Night Flix, call the library at 338-3884. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
