(Ross D. Franklin / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nLamar Odom's family said Thursday that his speech is improving as he undergoes therapy in Los Angeles more than a week after the former NBA star was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. \n\"He is beginning to gradually flourish both mentally and physically,\" said a statement from Alvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer. \"His use of speech has increased and he's more cognitively responsive.\" \nAlston called Odom's therapy regimen \"aggressive,\" but she did not elaborate. \nA day earlier, Odom and reality star Khloe Kardashian filed a court petition dismissing a divorce filing from December 2013. A clerk granted the request in such a way that the divorce papers can be refiled at a later date. \nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, and hospitalized in Las Vegas. \nThe brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2013 against one brand he took, Reload, after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:43:05.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
