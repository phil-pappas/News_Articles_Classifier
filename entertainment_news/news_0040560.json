When placed in an environment where the temperature is relatively high the ingredients included in PVC such as Chloride monomer (dioxin) are released into the air. This is very bad, especially in a grow room, because the usual temperature plants thrive at is more than enough to cause off-gassing of the PVC material which is both harmful for humans and plants.\nGrow tents allow you to create a perfectly controlled environment for plants. Virtually a micro-environment where one can control the temperature and humidity levels and photoperiod lighting. Grow tents can be virtually air tight which is very good for CO2 supplementation and to keep out bugs and other things. However, if the problem is the tent itself it could mean big trouble for the growth and life of plants. Obvious signs of plans being effected by the off gassing of PVC is the washing out or yellowing of the leaves which makes the leaf look almost white before turning brown. This can occur as early as the first few sets of leafs and has been known to start within the time the plant reaches three sets of nodes. Often times the main stalk will not develop fully and along with the branches which end up being thin and fragile. Roots are effected as well both in soil mixes and hydro set-ups by off gassing.\nGorilla Grow Tent cuts no corners in manufacturing tents. Customers are able to get the tallest, thickest and strongest grow tent without having to worry about off-gassing of harmful materials like PVC. Gorilla Grow Tents are a very smart choice for growers of all different skill sets as they offer a variety of benefits, are very straight-forward in set up and made of safe materials for any grow space.
