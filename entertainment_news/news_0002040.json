Andrew Cuomo to take on a special role in his daughter's life. \nEditors at New York Post gossip column Page Six report the couple marked Della's Christening on Tuesday and the politician was named her godfather. \nThe event was later celebrated with a dinner for around 20 guests at a Greek restaurant in Roslyn, New York. \nCuomo reportedly made a speech during the party. \nBilly and Alexis married in July and the governor presided over the wedding ceremony. \nThe couple has been together since 2009. \nThe musician is also dad to singer Alexa Ray Joel, 29, his only child with model Christie Brinkley, who he was married to from 1985 until 1994.
