It marks the latest step away from depictions of full nudity, which were banned from the magazine's website in August 2014. \nThe magazine claims it website audience soared with that move, averaging a 400 percent increase in monthly unique visitors. \n\"The political and sexual climate of 1953 ... bears almost no resemblance to today,\" said Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders. \"We are more free to express ourselves politically, sexually and culturally today, and that's in large part thanks to Hef's heroic mission to expand those freedoms.\" Playboy's new strategy: Less nudity \nNudity was revolutionary when Hugh Hefner launched playboy 62-years ago, but not anymore.
