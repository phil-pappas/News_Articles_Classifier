The former is developing a \"Hellfire\" series while the latter ordered a pilot for \"Legion\". Both projects have \"X-Men\" helmer Bryan Singer serving as executive producers. \"Hellfire\" will be based on the Marvel comics group \"The Hellfire Club\". Set in the late 1960s, the series follows a young special agent who learns that a power-hungry woman with extraordinary abilities is working with a clandestine society of millionaires, known as \"The Hellfire Club\" to take over the world. Patrick McKay and JD Payne are co-writing the script while \" 24 \" alums Evan Katz and Manny Coto are attached as showrunners. \"We are thrilled to partner with Marvel to bring this world to television and build upon the vibrant mythology that has captivated fans for years,\" said David Madden, president of entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company. He added, \"These powerful and dynamic characters are complicated and larger-than-life, the pace and visual imagination are unrelenting, and the story takes place during one of the most explosive eras in recent history. We are so looking forward to working with this incredibly talented team.\" Meanwhile, \"Legion\" tells the story of a troubled young man named David Haller, who may be more than human. Since he was a teenager, David has struggled with mental illness. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, he has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. But after a strange encounter with a fellow patient, he's confronted with the possibility that the voices he hears and the visions he sees might be real. In comics, he's the mutant son of Professor X. \" Fargo \" creator Noah Hawley is writing the pilot and exec producing. \" 'Legion' is just the sort of ambitious story that Noah excels at,\" Nick Grad, president of original programming at FX Networks and FX Productions, said. \"His adaption of 'Fargo' for television was one of the most acclaimed television events in recent memory. It's also an honor to partner with Marvel on 'Legion' and to enlist such an accomplished team of executive producers to create this pilot.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:12:04.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
