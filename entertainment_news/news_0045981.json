Comment andre.lamar@doverpost.com@302DoAndre Posted Oct. 1, 2015 @ 5:18 pm YouTube sensation Taylor Davis and her violin will take on the World Café Live in Philadelphia, Pa. on Sunday as part of her fall tour. Davis is known for performing covers of video-game tunes and scores from Hollywood films on the violin, while also cosplaying in outfits that match the theme of the music she’s playing. She will bring her new original album, “Taylor Davis,” to the World Café. The 12-track album hit stores in March and debuted at No. 10 on Billboard's classical chart. Davis has become one of the fastest-rising stars on YouTube, posting more than 100 videos, garnering more than 100 million-plus views and 800,000-plus subscribers. How did you fall in love with the violin? When I was in first grade I heard a young girl perform “Silent Night” on her violin at an elementary school Christmas assembly. I had never heard the violin performed live before and it really caught my attention in an emotional way; and I went home that day and asked my parents if I could start taking violin lessons. What sparked the idea of covering video game music? I've actually been playing video games longer than I've been playing the violin. I started to become interested in the music from games when I was in middle school, and ever since then it's been my favorite type of music. It definitely wasn't considered to be a \"cool\" thing to like when I was growing up and I didn't realize that there were so many other people out there who enjoyed this type of music until I started posting on my YouTube channel. What’s the last video game you played, and how’d you enjoy it? The last game I played was “The Witcher 3.” I loved that game so much and I actually have a “Witcher”-themed music video that I'll be releasing on my YouTube channel soon. If you had a chance to meet a composer from any era, who would it be? I have been really fortunate to have already met one of my all-time favorite composers Nobuo Uematsu, and that was really an honor for me. Besides him, I would really love to meet John Williams because I love and respect his work so much. What are your impressions of Lindsey Stirling, another popular female violinist who covers video game music? I've met Lindsey a few times at events/shows we were both at and she's a very nice person, and I think she's really great at what she does. Some people like to think there's a rivalry between us, just because we both play the violin and sometimes perform similar music on our YouTube channels. But there are absolutely no hard feelings between us and we both have a lot of respect for one another. What other exciting things do you have on the horizon? I'm going to begin working on a new album of original music and a new album of cover songs later this year; and I hope to have those both finished sometime next year. I also am hoping to announce another tour soon. I also have a lot of new videos that I'll be releasing on my channel later this year that I'm very excited about, so stay tuned for those releases as well.
