There’s a marvellous ease in his unfolding of the music: yes, you can still hear those darned blocks of musical stone, which build Bruckner’s monolithic structures, being lowered into place and assembling interminably into a cathedral pile. But the conductor doesn’t shove it down your throat. He doesn’t shout, but does it all so gently, fluidly and expressively that the music has a rare charm: it’s not often one could use that word about Bruckner’s music. Good playing from the orchestra, though I find the live recording from the Royal Festival Hall last March a bit one-dimensional.\nMichael Tumelty", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-04T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:16:01.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
