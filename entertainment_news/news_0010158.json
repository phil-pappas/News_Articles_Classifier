Most of the time, when these rare birds appear here as a result of a weather condition, a storm must make landfall. If the storm cruises past us, up the coast, few or no tropical birds will be seen. \nIn some cases, as with Joaquin, we did get a pair of sooty terns that were spotted and photographed from the Avalon Seawatch, in Cape May County. These are birds that nest on the Dry Tortugas, a group of small islands off the coast of south Florida. They seldom venture north of North Carolina's Outer Banks. \nThere were a few other seabird gifts to NJ birders as a result of the hurricane. Parasitic jaegers, seldom seen from shore in North Jersey, were discovered in Raritan Bay in South Amboy and at Sandy Hook. Three others were seen off the Seaside Heights boardwalk. \nAnother prize bird was a red phalarope, discovered in a pond at Mercer Corporate Park in Robbinsville. This is a bird that very rarely makes landfall in New Jersey, so birders by the dozens were making a beeline to see it. A pair of not-so-rare, yet very uncommon red-necked phalaropes appeared on Sylvan Lake in Bradley Beach. The red phalarope remained for a few days in Robbinsville to the delight of many. Sooty, bridled and noddy terns, as well as petrels and shearwaters — including a sooty shearwater also seen from Seaside Heights — are likely candidates to occur here following hurricanes. \nMany birders bravely make their way to the coast, especially in Cape May, as soon as they can after a storm, in the hope of finding an avian prize. Cape May Point did produce one excellent bird that may or may not have been storm related — a ruff, a rare Eurasian sandpiper that visits North American annually in small numbers. The bird was seen flying south over Delaware Bay, heading south. \nWe will likely have to wait until next year for another hurricane avian opportunity, but we can't forget that, in 2012, Sandy struck at the end of October. \nThis column is compiled and written by Pete Bacinski, longtime New Jersey birder and retired NJ Audubon All Things Birds program director.
