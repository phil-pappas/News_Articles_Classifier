That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.' And you sit there, and you know you're on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don't want him - or his family - to think you're firing shots at him,\" Swift said.\"So you say, 'That was about losing a friend.' And that's basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. \"I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn't want to be labelled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.\" © Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicTaylor Swift The interviewer then suggested that nobody thinks the subject was a guy.\"But they would have,\" Swift continues. \"So I don't necessarily care who people think it's about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn't point to any one person or any one situation. \"But if you'd listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.\" © Getty Images / Larry BusaccaKanye West and Taylor Swift The star also talked about the infamous Kanye West stage intrusion at the 2009 VMA's.\"When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn't deserve the award. That's where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. \"I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn't that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. \"And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other - that's one of my favourite things that has happened in my career.\"Swift was recently called \"remarkable\" but \"not unique\" by Blur frontman Damon Albarn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:41:22.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
