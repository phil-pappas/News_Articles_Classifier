Apparently, he saw the cart as half empty.\nOnce burned, twice shy, the saying goes.\nAfter months of emptying the carts every week, the city announced it was collecting recycling twice a month and sent a schedule.\nIt all sounds easy enough. As the new slogan said, starting Oct. 12, \"Every other week, take it to the street.\"\nI’m embarrassed to admit this, but I messed up again.\nLast week the cart was about one-quarter full, so I didn’t roll it to the street.\nIt didn't seem worth it to bring the quarter-full blue recycling cart to the street. (Photo: Patti Singer/@PattiSingerRoc)\nImagine my surprise when I arrived home to find a plastic bag on my doorknob, and this gentle reprimand.\nA little reminder to those of us who can't figure out how and when to recycle. (Photo: Patti Singer/@PattiSingerRoc)\nCompletely confused, I called the city’s 311 information line to ask, “Just how much has to be in the recycling cart to put it at the curb?”\nAny amount, the operator told me.\nI recounted my experience back in the winter, when I first received the big blue beauty, and the operator said now it doesn’t matter.\nTo paraphrase the reminder left on my door, she said, “Take it out every other week.”\n“Recycling shouldn’t be this hard,” I said.\n“Hopefully they’ll get it together soon,” the operator said. But I think she was referring to me.\nI hope I do get it together. I’d hate to flunk recycling and have them take my cart away.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/844d957a0d54eeed58dca3f9d77f92cbafed2d3f/c=280-0-1762-2646&r=583&c=0-0-580-1031/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811261326545717-recycle-reminder.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd470b309b1faa8a2502ad0a9a5015d0857b9353/c=0-606-3261-2448&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811256534663000-Bin-quarter-full-Oct.-2015.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811256534663000-Bin-quarter-full-Oct.-2015.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/Rochester/635811261326545717-recycle-reminder.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:06:16.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
