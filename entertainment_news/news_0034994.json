Just like the first trailer, the new one highlights the competition between a father ( Mark Wahlberg ) and a stepfather ( Will Ferrell ) for winning the affection of two innocent children. While Brad (Ferrel) tries to be the best stepfather to his wife's ( Linda Cardellini ) children, their badass biological father Dusty (Wahlberg) comes back into their lives. The two dads start to do anything to secure the children's love even though it is harmful for them. It happens when Brad tries to duplicate Dusty's skills in skateboarding, but he ends up hitting power cables. The battle continues as Brad surprises the family with Los Angeles Lakers playoff tickets. Dusty then gives more surprising gifts, inviting his kids and ex-wife to sit court-side and snap selfies with the team. \"Want to take a picture with Kobe?\" he asks. According to the official synopsis, the upcoming movie follows \"a mild-mannered radio executive who strives to become the best stepdad to his wife's two children, but complications ensue when their freewheeling and freeloading real father arrives, forcing him to compete for the affection of the kids.\" Also joining the cast are Paul Scheer, Hannibal Buress , LaMonica Garrett and Billy Slaughter. Directed by Sean Anders, the comedy movie will hit U.S. theaters on December 25 . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Daddy's Home News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:46.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
