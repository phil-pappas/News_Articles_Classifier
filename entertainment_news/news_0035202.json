It takes a stalwart and intrepid individual to take on such a task; after the tremendous success of the 1960 novel and the 1962 film, you had better get it right. And he did. The stage play conveys the salient plot points of the earlier iterations, incorporating language from the novel and capturing the essence and tone of the work. Devices such as narration in the form of asides to the audience and offstage sound and lighting effects efficiently and effectively move the narrative along. It’s 1935 in Maycomb, Alabama, in the height of the Great Depression and the glory days of Jim Crow in the South. This sleepy burg has a harsh wake-up call when Mayella Ewell (Eleanor Tynan), a poor and uneducated white girl, accuses Tom Robinson (D. Adam Boaz), a black man, of rape. Atticus Finch (James P. Byrne) is assigned the case as a public defender. The ensuing trial galvanizes the county, eliciting the very worst and very best of human nature. It’s a story of class and racial divides, of power abused and justice miscarried, but, most of all, it is a coming-of-age story seen through the lens of two motherless children being raised by a principled and fiercely honest man. The Cape Cod Theatre Company production is cleverly staged and brilliantly cast, with almost 20 ensemble members, some playing dual roles both onstage and backstage. The actors are carefully choreographed by director Julie Allen Hamilton, who directs her daughter, Nell Daisy Hamilton, in the pivotal role of Scout Finch. Simply put, this child is amazing. She captures the nuances of the onscreen role we recall while making it her own. Scout is the memory, soul and conscience of this story and Nell Hamilton nails it, big time. In an extraordinary cast, other standouts include Charles Bennison as the despicable Bob Ewell, Elizabeth Liuzzi as neighbor/narrator Maudie Atkinson and Macklin Devine’s delightful Dill, friend to the Finch children (the character is based on Lee’s childhood friend, Truman Capote). And let’s not forget Atticus; James P. Byrne has some big shoes to fill (Gregory Peck!) but he makes Atticus his unique version. This production at this time is significant. The story recounts history. While illustrating how far we have come, it reminds us of how far we need to travel. Our world is still racially and socio-economically divided. The release this year of Harper Lee’s only other novel –“Go Set a Watchman”– was controversial in its depiction of Atticus as a hero with feet of clay. One needs to consider things in context; Atticus lived in troubled times. If you know and love the book and the movie, go see this play. If you know nothing about the book or the movie, go see this play. It is one of the best productions I have seen this year to date. Please note, the production is not appropriate for young children.
