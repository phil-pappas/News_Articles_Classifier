To help me understand how simple it is-- Wait, let me back that up. To understand the logic behind Eddie's skills, I had Tony Savarino over to the couch.\nSavarino can play any style. And he does on his trilogy of LPs: \"Guitaring,” “Guitaresque,” and “Guitararino.” On them the hotshot tears into classic stuff with equal amounts of reverence, pluck and cheek. He lays down Bobby Hebb's “Sunny” with lounge cool (a little Wes Montgomery in there?), carves up the Ventures' arrangement of Tchaikovsky and twists Duke Ellington's “Caravan” into a Van Halen/Yngwie Malmsteen hydra. Savarino is also a first call guy in bands around New England -- he's playing with Ruby Rose Fox and I couldn't be happier (see them at The Delancey in NYC on Friday).\nIf you dig Savarino, or Eddie, get your rock on with Alex Necochea . If you don't dig, you're nuts. But you can still enjoy the rest of the Guestlisted Guitar collection.", "external_links": ["http://www.tonysavarino.com/", "http://thedelancey.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:25:28.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
