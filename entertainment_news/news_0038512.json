The actor, who is a part of Kamal Haasan’s eagerly awaited Thoongavanam, says that it was because of actor Priya Anand that she landed the role. \n“People think women actors don’t get along with one another but that is not true. In fact, it was Priya Anand, my close friend, who referred me for this project. She was the one who put me on to Sitara, the line producer and that is how I became a part of Thoongavanam.” \nCommenting on her experience of working on the film, she says, “It is a dream come true. When one gets the opportunity to act along one’s favourite stars, it just feels so surreal. This is one such opportunity because Kamal sir has been my favourite actor from the time I began watching cinema,” she begins. \nGet her to speak about her role in the film which is a remake of the French thriller Sleepless Night and she firmly refuses. “It’s a brief but very interesting role that I play in Thoongavanam. Beyond that, I cannot says anything more. Everyday, working with Kamal sir was a challenge. I felt so immature. He, however, made sure that I gave my best,” she gushes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:31:51.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
