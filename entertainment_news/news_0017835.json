Runners must collect tokens at three points along the main route, which is essentially the park’s perimeter. Gnome-hatted officials at various points along the trails can award a token for one minute off a runner’s or a team’s score. \nLeashed dogs are OK on the course. Costumes are encouraged. The event benefits Wild Whatcom, an outdoor education program. \nRegistration is $35 single, $45 for a three-member team (which can include children) and $10 for the approximately one-mile Derby Dash on the east side of the park. There’s no fee for children who run with their parents, and parents can register and run in the Derby Dash with their child. \nFor more information, to register, and to see a map of the course, go online to runwildbellingham.com .
