It kicks off this weekend and runs through Oct. 31. \nIn addition to its wildly popular (and polar opposite) family-friendly Boo at the Zoo, the zoo branched out to offer a darker event, making use of the woods and the apprehension most associated with the scariest holiday of the year. \n\"We feel like we own the family Halloween market here, and we're sensitive to that, and that is our brand,\" said Keith Winsten, the zoo's executive director. \"We love that, and we don't want to move away from it. But we felt that there is this unmet need, which is more adult, and that we're in a position to do a really quality job, and to use our greatest assets, which is the woods. There is something intrinsically scary about the woods.\" \nStory continues below: Video: Trail of Terror Brevard Zoo By Craig Rubadoux, FLORIDA TODAY Posted Oct. 8, 2015 \nOr, as Andrea Hill, marketing and communications director, said in a news release: \"Our goal is to scare your pants off.\" \nTo do that, the zoo has enlisted the help of professional makeup artists for the 50 or so scare actors who will be lurking evilly at Treetop Trek. Alan Ostrander of AEO Studios in Orlando is part of the special-effects makeup team that will transform humans into monsters for Trail of Terror. \n\"It is going to be terrifying,\" he said. \"It is a haunt like Brevard has not seen before. It is definitely not something for the little tiny ones. It is going to be very intense. \n\"The zoo alone by itself at night is an intimidating place with all the lights off when you're alone in the woods out there,\" Ostrander added, \"and we're going to spice it up just a little bit.\" \nStory continues below Buy Photo Trail of Terror with the Woods family a brand new Haunted Attraction featuring live actors elaborate sets and terrifying special effects at the Brevard Zoo 8:30 pm to Midnight every Friday & Saturday Oct. 9-31st.
