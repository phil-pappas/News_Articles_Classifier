Goldie Hawn (Ken McKay/ITV/REX) \nTalking about her long-time partner, whom she met when they worked together on 1984 film Swingset, she said: “We’ve been married before, didn’t work. So why do it again?” \nThe star continued: “Marriage ends up being a business deal because at the end of a marriage, no matter how long or how short it is, somebody owes somebody money. I was at the short end of the stick on that one. Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson and Kurt Russell (Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) \n“I look at that and I thought, ‘well, this is ridiculous’. This kind of thing where you’re together two, three, four, or even five years. It’s an inappropriate amount of money that you have to pay. And it’s ridiculous to base your relationship on money. Money can destroy people, it really can. It’s really nice when a woman can go out and have her own money.” Promoted stories \nBest known over here for movies ranging from Private Benjamin to The First Wives Club, Goldie was married to musician Bill Hudson from 1976-1982. They have two children together: actors Kate and Oliver Hudson. \nSon Wyatt Russell has followed his mother, father and half-siblings into the acting business. \nThe blonde star was asked whether her children share her views on marriage, especially as her daughter is now divorced from Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson. \n“Kate is also in a similar situation as I was, self-sustaining, in many ways, obviously financially. Our children have grown up understanding that’s a fair deal. Women working and self-worth isn’t such a bad thing.” \nVarious topics were discussed on the ITV morning show and the award-winning actress shared concerns about online child safety. \n“Now I’m hearing all the things my kids did! But times have changed so much,” she stated. \n“At that point, I wouldn’t have thought of looking into Kate’s diary or Oliver’s thing because I want to be able to give them the integrity of being a person and really trust them. On the other side, today, I’m not so sure it would be that way. \n“We’re living in a different society, we have demons out there, we have a lot of things we have to be aware of and it frightens me to think that my children would be prey to any of these things.” How glam does our @RuthieeL and new Loose Woman @goldiehawn look today. See you in 2 for today's show #LooseWomen pic.twitter.com/huPJMlrirs \n— Loose Women (@loosewomen) October 12, 2015 \nThe conversation turned to social media, and Goldie offered her opinion on attitudes to self-worth. “The world that we live in is very scrutinising, extremely scrutinising. Doesn’t matter how old you are, as you get older it’s even worse,” she stated. \n“Now, everyone wants to be a star: people want to be seen, we want to have the most followers possible, we don’t want to lose any followers, what will we do to get those followers to stay with us, how edgy can we be? We have to be able to have some sort of ethical standards in our society,” she said. Share article \nGoldie Hawn is also promoting the Hawn Foundation, which provides youth education programmes.
