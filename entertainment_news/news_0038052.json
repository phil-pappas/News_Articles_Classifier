(Michael Buckner, Getty Images) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nLamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian have decided to stay married as the former NBA star continues his recovery a week after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. \nKardashian's lawyer, Laura Wasser, filed a petition Wednesday to dismiss the reality star's divorce filing from December 2013. A clerk granted the request in such a way that the divorce papers can be refiled at a later date. \nThe document doesn't state a reason for the change but shows Odom signed off on dismissing the divorce Tuesday. \nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada, and hospitalized in Las Vegas. He regained consciousness Friday and was transported to Los Angeles on Monday. \nKardashian posted a statement to her website Monday saying Odom made \"incredible strides\" at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas and thanking the doctors and nurses \"for their kindness and diligent work.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:41:56.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
