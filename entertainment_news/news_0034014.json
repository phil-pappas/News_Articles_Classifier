Barker was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he received stiches for the head wound, Bollinger said.\nHe walked out of the hospital, said Bollinger, who drove him home.\nIt's fortunate that the injuries weren't more serious, his friend said, but Barker's exercise schedule will be temporarily curtailed.\n\"He's upset he can't work out and take his walks. Considering his age, he's in pretty good shape,\" Bollinger said.\nBarker was the longtime host of \"The Price is Right,\" retiring from the game show in 2007 after 35 years.\nHe remains busy as an advocate of animal rights in the United States and other countries, Bollinger said.\nRelated Stories Bob Barker wants Ontario orca ban to extend to Marineland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:55:33.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
