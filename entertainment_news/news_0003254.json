October 25, 2015 Last updated: Sunday, October 25, 2015, 1:21 AM The Record Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of \"Hamilton.\" \nPity the poor producers of this season's new Broadway musicals. \nBecause of something that happened last summer, their chances of achieving their dream — winning a best-musical Tony Award — are meager. \nThat August event, near the beginning of the 2015-16 theater year, was the opening of \"Hamilton,\" a show that has enthralled everyone. \nWhile I know better than to pre-judge the quality of shows I haven't seen, the eight incoming productions face a daunting challenge in competing with \"Hamilton\" for the Tony and other end-of-season theater honors. It's not absolutely necessary for a musical to win a Tony in order to have a long run — \"Wicked\" was beaten out in 2004 by \"Avenue Q\" (for book and score, as well as best show) and is still going strong as it nears its 12th anniversary — but an award is a huge boost. \nThere have been occasions when producers have delayed their openings until the following season when faced with a juggernaut rival, but that's not as easy as it sounds. \nPutting together a production is a complex business. It depends on financing being in place, the desired actors and director being available and a theater being free. When all those things converge, producers don't want to put a project on hold. \nAnyway, here are brief looks at the shows, in order of opening, that will be taking up the \"Hamilton\" gauntlet this season. (One new musical, \"Amazing Grace,\" has already opened — and is closing today. It's an unlikely award candidate.) \n* \"On Your Feet!\" — A bio-show about Latin-pop singing star Gloria Estefan and her musician husband Emilio, featuring their music. (Neither one appears in the production.) \n* \"Allegiance\" — Starring George Takei (\"Star Trek\") and Lea Salonga (\"Miss Saigon\"), the musical focuses on a Japanese-American family removed from its California farm after the attack on Pearl Harbor and interned in Wyoming. \n* \"School of Rock\" — Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical is adapted from the 2003 film about a teacher who molds his elementary-school students into a rock band. \n* \"Bright Star\" — Co-written by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, with a bluegrass, country-music score, the show tells two love stories set in the South in the first half of the 20th century. \n* \"American Psycho\" — An adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel about a high-living, multi-murdering Manhattan businessman in the gaudy 1980s. Benjamin Walker (\"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\") stars. \n* \"Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed\" — The mouthful title describes a reworking of the hit 1920s show — written and performed by African-Americans — to include the stories of its origin and impact. Audra McDonald, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Billy Porter head the cast. (It's not yet known whether the Tony Awards administrators will rule the production to be a new show or a revival, although it'll probably be the former.) \n* \"Waitress\" — Jessie Mueller, a Tony-winner for \"Beautiful,\" stars in the adaptation of the 2007 independent film about an unhappily married waitress with a talent for pie-making. \n* \"Tuck Everlasting\" — The show is based on Natalie Babbitt's highly popular 1975 children's novel about a spring that offers eternal life to those who drink its waters. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:26:49.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
