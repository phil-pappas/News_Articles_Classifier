Lowy's order this morning to commit Chism, 16, was a complete about-face on his decision late yesterday to appoint two independent mental-health experts to interview the juvenile and report back to him.\nThe law allows for Chism to be hospitalized for up to 20 days; however, Dr. Debra Anne Pinals, assistant commissioner of forensic mental health services for the state Department of Mental Health, told Lowy during a telephone conference his stay could be extended another 20 days.\nWith hundreds of prospective jurors and witnesses whose lives are on hold waiting for the trial to get underway, Lowy told Pinals, \"There's a lot at stake if it can be done in less than 20 days. If it can't be, it can't be.\"\nPinals told Lowy Worcester State Hospital is prepared to take Chism, but lacks any high-security measures. It would take a court order to commit Chism to Bridgewater State Hospital because he is a juvenile and can't be incarcerated at a state prison until his 18th birthday.\nThe trial teams are awaiting word from Lowy on where Chism will be sent.\nChism was 14 on Oct. 22, 2013, when prosecutors say the then Danvers High School freshman raped and murdered his math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, of Andover.\nChism, whose courthouse behavior has grown increasingly bizarre since Tuesday when he reportedly was banging his head on the floor of his cell, agreed to make an appearance at the defense table today after refusing to come out yesterday.\nHe sat silently with his head slumped.\nAssistant Essex District Attorney Kate MacDougall, who yesterday called Chism a \"manipulative ... fake\" who is holding the trial \"hostage,\" said to Lowy today, \"In 20 days we're going to sit here exactly where we are (now) with the court having to make a determination. My feeling is whatever happens, we need to go forward.\"\nLowy said Chism's lawyers have an ethical obligation to be assured their client can work with them and understand the possible consequences of what is happening to him.\n\"My job is to have an open mind,\" Lowy said, \"and that's what I'm going to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:02:01.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
