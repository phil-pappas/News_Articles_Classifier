To a packed audience of family, peers, staff, faculty, and students, the writers shared stories about eating disorders, family trauma, mental illness, and supporting a loved one’s battle with AIDS and its many concomitant misdiagnoses and complications.\nCreative nonfiction is a genre that celebrates the very specific personal story and its unfailing power to resonate with readers. The context of the classroom at OLLU provides a physical and psychological safe space for such sharing. The public readings and publications of these works offer others a chance to learn these stories, recognize the resonances and feel less alone.\nMore Information Best Man\nBy Owen Lewis\nDos Madres Press, $16\nOLLU’s MA/MFA program is a very rare one, one of the few in the country that focuses pointedly on social justice.\nSocial justice is an intrinsic part of narrative medicine. In our program, we endeavor to encourage empathy and promote human dignity. Narrative medicine helps those in the health professions to value the personal experience of each individual patient and to encourage self-reflection and creativity in health professionals.\nOwen Lewis is a physician who works with the program in narrative medicine at Columbia University . There, the faculty and staff are invited to explore the many interfaces between narrative and improving health care, in part, through the study of lectures, readings and performances.\nLewis has taken this part of his vocation further. As a poet now, in his latest collection, “Best Man,” he provides an elegy in 23 moving poems for his brother, who died at the age of 23.\nThe book offers a painful if sympathetic discourse on addiction and mental illness. He also paints lucid images of the quiet chaos of the anxious fears and hard-won understanding of those left behind, but also a patient promise of healing.\nOwen Lewis reads from “Best Man” at the inaugural event of the Social Justice Reading Series in Our Lady of the Lake University’s Providence Hall Blue Room at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday.\nYvette Benavides is a professor of English at Our Lady of the Lake University and the graduate program director of the MA/MFA in Literature, Creative Writing, and Social Justice.
