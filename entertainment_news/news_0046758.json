Lucky for all of us, warm and cold, Happy Ever After's contributors recommended some new romances this week:\nI Heard a Rumor by Cheris Hodges. This one begins with the characters standing deep in drama higher than their knees. Neither Chante nor Zach is unscathed by the actions and mistreatment from their former lovers. The pain, beautifully written, is there for us to understand and feel, alongside this couple. Hodges writes strong characters who are up to the challenge for the trials they will encounter and endure to be happy. The arc of their development comes edged with feisty stubbornness and a bit of humor to round out the sharp angles. You won't put down a book by Cheris Hodges only to forget about the characters hours or even days later. Once again, she delivers a winner for a great romantic read. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nThe Queen by Tiffany Reisz. I came in on this last book in the Original Sinners series (No. 8). I'm sure that I'm not the only one. Good news, though, the Reisz-aholics can rest assured that another one has been added to the circle. If The Queen is the initiation, then may I have another, please? The plot is not a straight line from A to Z. Simplicity is definitely not Tiffany Reisz's aim as she spins strands of her tales over the life of the series from different points of view and from different timelines. And yet, she draws the stories — revelations, secrets, histories — back to the center and ties it up with a neat bow as a wonderful gift to her readers. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nThis Tender Melody by Kianna Alexander. Kianna Alexander's Kimani debut is a wonderful addition to my recommended reads for romance fiction. Alexander creates a world where romance is begging to be acknowledged, if only its people can get it together. Descriptive and sensual, the story details draw you in to sit and enjoy and swoon over the hunky hero. Misfits on the outside, the characters' inner journeys prove that the two belong together. Alexander delivers, not only with the story, but also with the touching and healing bonds of true love. Sexy and unforgettable, This Tender Melody is worthy of celebration. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nSell Out by Tracy L. Gray. This one's timed to coincide with October's distinction as National Bullying Prevention Month. Gray crafts a powerful and melt-worthy YA romance that pits two teenagers against their separate hopes, regrets and sorrows, exploring how the heartaches that occur outside the quest for love can greatly impact its ability to survive. (Recommended by Serena Chase)\nA Mad Zombie Party. (Photo: Harlequin Teen)\nA Mad Zombie Party by Gena Showalter. I have adored the last three books in the series but, like many other readers, thought there was more to the story. I didn't like that Frosty was left so forlorn, and there was just so much unresolved angst! I'm glad Gena decided to write A Mad Zombie Party! I didn't know if I was going to be able to accept Frosty and Camilla's \"alliance.\" I mean, what about Kat? It took a while, but Gena pulled it out. I fell for both of them and loved Kat and Frosty's changing relationship. (Recommended by Jessie Potts)\nRough Road by Vanessa North. Rough Road is the second book in Vanessa North's Lake Lovelace series. The first book, Double Up, was set in the world of wake boarding. We first met Eddie in that book and now it is Eddie's turn at romance. This book is written in first-person, present tense, which is an unusual writing style. Ms. North pulls it off perfectly, allowing the reader to follow along with the story and character development smoothly. It isn't necessary to read the first book in the series, but doing so would add to the reader's enjoyment of Rough Road.
