These days, the 57-year-old star seems eager to drive home a point: In a world brimming with pop contenders, there's still only one of her.\nWith her father and daughter looking on, Madonna also served up the most Detroit-centric show we've ever seen from an artist who for years has been accused of spurning her roots. There were pep talks about the city's resilience, celebrations of the city's comeback (\"Watch out!\"), even a shout-out to developer and \"incredible guy\" Dan Gilbert.\nThe spectacle had started with a big helping of new \"Rebel Heart\" fare to go with Madonna's latest foray into erotic religious imagery, her male dancers costumed as cross-bearing knights and their female counterparts as pole-dancing nuns. From there on through the euphoric \"Holiday\" encore, the two-hour-plus show kept up the brisk pace — a whirl of set changes, outfits that quickly went from lavish to skimpy, and tight, intricate dance numbers that often found their way down the lengthy catwalk.\nIn a defiant assertion of her relevance, Madonna has long used her tours to emphasize her latest music, and Thursday was no different: The set was loaded with \"Rebel Heart\" material, and when she did tap the older stuff, it got unapologetically reinvented. She strapped on a guitar to dial up the riff wattage of 1983's \"Burning Up,\" and turned \"Dress You Up\" into a colorful, festive number complete with some rumba and a conga line. She and guitarist Monte Pittman doubled on ukuleles for \"True Blue,\" and teamed up again with acoustic guitars on \"Who's That Girl.\" \"Like a Virgin\" was stripped into a spare, throbbing number in a rare scene that saw Madonna alone on the stage, a shared moment of intimate nostalgia between artist and audience.\nElsewhere, the classics got nipped and tucked inside other numbers, leaving fans with brief tastes of songs like \"Vogue,\" \"Into the Groove\" and \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore.\"\nThursday brought a lean-and-lithe Madonna who balanced seriously intense performances with a lighthearted, sometimes mischievous spirit. For all the sizzle — the dazzling set pieces, the splashy visuals, the eye-popping interludes by her supremely skilled dance crew — it was a show that planted some genuine heart in the proceedings.\nThat was certainly the mood as she deposited ample Detroit devotion throughout. More than a year after providing financial support to several community organizations, Madonna name-checked two of them (the Empowerment Plan and Downtown Boxing Gym) from the Joe Louis stage, and spoke enthusiastically about her working relationship with Gilbert, the Quicken Loans magnate and downtown developer.\n\"Detroit made me who I am today, so I want to say thank you with these next few songs,\" she said while easing into a stretch that included \"Rebel Heart,\" dedicated to her dad somewhere out in the crowd, 84-year-old Silvio Ciccone.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nBrian McCollum: Prodigal daughter Madonna opens her heart to hometown\nShe also veered from her tour's stock set list to present a Detroit exclusive: a gentle version of 1998's \"Frozen.\" The Motor City is \"the heart of America,\" she explained, thus transforming the song's open-your-heart lyrics into a plea to the country to unlock Detroit's potential.\nStill, it's hard to suss out precisely where Madonna stands on the topic her roots, given her recent dismissive remarks about Rochester Hills , the town where she actually grew up. A cynic might say she's out to have it both ways: scorning her native suburban culture while embracing the concept of \"Detroit\" now that it's finally cool.\nBut it's hard to look a gift horse in the mouth, and if Madonna wants to dive into the comeback of Detroit — a place she continually referenced as \"we\" — she'll be met with open arms, and should be. A city that has taken a fall \"can only go up,\" she said Thursday night, \"and I'm very proud to be part of that going-up process.\"\nDaughter Lourdes Leon, in her second year at the University of Michigan, got her own personal tribute from Mom onstage.\nAddressing the 18-year-old by her nickname Lola, Madonna gushed as she sat down with a ukulele for a winsome performance of Edith Piaf's French pop classic \"La Vie en Rose.\" Lola, she said, was \"the first person to teach me about love,\" and to top it off, was better at singing and speaking French.\n\"Thank you, Lola,\" she said. \"You are my princess.\"\nContact Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cdecce4dcdb81331ff17182b436df2a74637656f/r=300/http/cmsimg.freep.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=C4&Date=20140701&Category=COL18&ArtNo=307010026&Ref=AR&Border=0"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:21:29.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
