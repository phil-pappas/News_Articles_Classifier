Miller For The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 4:22 pm Updated at 4:26 PM One of the biggest pop music stars in Canada has hardly made a ripple in the United States – until now. Coeur de Pirate (Heart of a Pirate), which is the moniker of 26-year old Quebec native Beatrice Martin, is on her first American tour, which touches down at Brighton Music Hall on Wednesday night. Her latest album, “Roses” recently sat at the number two spot on the Canadian pop charts, just behind The Weeknd, while the single from that album, “Carry On,” owned the top spot on the Canadian singles charts for 11 straight weeks. But until this fall, Martin had been mostly just an intriguing YouTube sensation for fans in the U.S. Learning to play piano at age 3, Martin had studied at the Conservatory de Quebec a Montreal by age 9, where she studied music and composition for the next five years. As she entered her teens, Martin began exploring pop music, and was playing keyboards in a “post-hardcore” rock band at age 15. She later played keys in 2007 & 2008 with the rock group Bonjour Brumaire, before making her solo debut, as Coeur de Pirate in late 2008. Martin’s debut, titled “Coeur de Pirate” sold well, aided by one tune’s use on a viral video. She released a second album, “Blonde,” in 2011, which was also successful on the Canadian charts. But Martin spent most of 2012 on hiatus from music, as she married Alex Peyrat and soon had a daughter, Romy, born in September 2012. Martin stayed in the public eye by providing music for the Canadian TV series “Trauma” in 2014, and her work highlighted a soundtrack album from the show that also sold well. Nominated for two Juno Awards – the Canadian equivalent of the Grammy’s – Martin’s third album brought her something she’d been hoping for, a record deal with American label Cherrytree Records, part of the Interscope family. Much of Martin’s early work alternated between French and English, but as her career has moved along she has done more and more of her songwriting in English. On the new CD, the hit single “Carry On” frames her trilling vocal over a lively rhythmic foundation, and the palpable yearning in her words and voice makes it exceptionally compelling. The more sprawling “Oceans Brawl” is a harrowing ballad about abandonment, where Martin’s keyboards are riveting in the sparse arrangement. “Cast Away” is a tender, delightfully melodic ballad about a reluctant lover. But “Undone” might be the most intriguing song of them all, a story-song about commitment that is impossible to resist. We conducted an email interview with Martin last week, as she traveled through the Midwest. Did your songwriting begin with those two rock bands of her teenage years. I never wrote anything in my previous projects,” Martin replied. ” I guess I hadn’t realized I could just yet. Even with the side project I had called Armistice, it was mainly the other person that did the writing. I was lacking confidence back then, to probably admit to myself that I was a decent song writer. It took me at least seven to eight years to realize it. I’ve noted that you have done a lot of your early work in French – do you write now mainly in French or English? I write in both now, I’ve always written in English as well but I just never wanted to release it. Again, that probably came from a fear that it wouldn’t be good, that it would be perceived weirdly... we are very protective of the French language here in Quebec. When you start doing a project in French, it’s always a little tricky to see beyond that. I love writing and singing in French, but I love to do it in English as well. There’s also a good amount of appealing poetry in your lyrics – does that make it difficult to translate songs from one language to the other? In other words, is it hard to keep the same meaning and feeling, and also try to have it rhyme? I only had to translate one song off this record which is “Carry On.” The rest I wrote either in French, or in English. And yeah it was hard because I had to find the same sense to the lyrics ... not translate word for word because that’s not that interesting. I was trying to translate images and metaphors, feelings and meanings... that was something. When you take “Carry On” and “Oublie-moi” which mean completely different things, but are very similar at the same time (oublie-moi meaning forget me...) it’s up to the audience to make their peace with it and find a balance. I love that you can transform a song with the same meaning and it can mean something completely different to another. How do you feel your songwriting had progressed, from that first album, through the second and now to this third full-length. I started at 18, so my songwriting was angrier perhaps. I needed to get back, get vengeance for certain things. I was holding grudges. Now my songwriting is more peaceful I guess. My voice developed greatly because of touring and practice and whatnot so that’s good. The first two records were about dealing with other people and making them know I was angry at them. This record is more introspective, dealing with my own insecurities, knowing how it has affected me and other around me. That takes a certain amount of work. In terms of your latest album, the biggest change is that you are now a wife and mother. Has that changed your perspective? Specifically, “Undone” seems to be a song about commitment, and you must have a different view of that now? “Undone” is my first, true love song! I realized so many things, how being committed to someone in our day in age is just so much more harder than anything. How there can be no place for negativity once you have a kid, at least not in her eyes. My songwriting has a light at the end of the tunnel ... that wasn’t there before. I keep in mind that one day my daughter will listen to this, as an adult at least, and I hope she sees the impact she’s had on me. From being an angry teenager ranting about hurtful ex-boyfriends to someone that wants to genuinely help through music. At least I hope I’m doing that. How about the music for the TV series, did that offer a new view of songwriting? It was just covers, so it was mostly a good interpretation exercise. I had to sing other people’s songs – how could I do them justice? It was a big task, not one I’ll feel comfortable doing again, not on a record anyway. It was really a job more than anything that I’m glad I got to do, but yeah.. it’s more of a live thing/promo/tv for me, covers. How about some basic info on the shows on this tour: what does your touring band include? I’d guess your sets focus on the new album, but also include material from all three albums? Songs in both languages? I have a guitarist, a keyboardist, a bassist and a drummer. I play piano and do my thing. It includes mostly the new album, also some of the previous hits. Songs in both languages of course ... the show doesn’t change, but my jokes do. Music previewCOEUR DE PIRATE 8 p.m. Wednesday, Brighton Music Hall, 158 Brighton Ave., Boston.
