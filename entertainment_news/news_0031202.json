Starring Dylan Penn, the daughter of two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn , the movie centers on kids living in a condemned, filthy squat on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Making its way out via EW , the trailer begins with a group of teenagers spending their time together in an unlikely building. The situation drastically changes when one of the building's residents is infected by a virus originating from their own waste. The people inside the building then lose their minds and go on murderous rampages. \"Every resident in the four block radius is under house arrest and I want you to make sure that the whole street is quarantined. Do not start a panic,\" Michel Gill's character says to someone in the phone. In the upcoming movie, Gill stars as an agent of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Directed by Eli Morgan Gesner, the upcoming movie also stars Ronen Rubinstein (\" Some Kind of Hate \"), Lydia Hearst (\" Cabin Fever: Patient Zero \"), Jon Abrahams (\"Scary Movie\"), Honor Titus, Johnny Messner and Genevieve Hudson-Price. \"Condemned\" is scheduled to be released in limited theaters in the U.S. on November 13. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Condemned News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:54.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
