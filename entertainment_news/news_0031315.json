(AP) -- Former teen idol David Cassidy has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with an expired tag after a crash in Florida last month. \nThe Sun Sentinel (http://tinyurl.com/oyqlj59) quotes police as saying that the 65-year-old Cassidy sideswiped a truck and then tried to cover his license plate before driving away with a flat tire. The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup. \nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27. \nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. \n___ \nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/ \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
