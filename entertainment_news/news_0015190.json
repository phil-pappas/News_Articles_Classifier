Federico Lombardi, said in a statement.\n90 Photos Pope Francis in America Pope Francis visits Washington, New York and Philadelphia\nAs a result, Charamsa could no longer work at the Vatican or its pontifical universities, Lombardi said. Despite his dismissal, Charamsa remains a priest, although Lombardi hinted that his superiors could take further action.\nCharamsa, 43, initially planned a press conference in front of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith's office, but moved it to central Rome after the Vatican action. He was joined by his companion, identified only as Eduard.\nCharamsa told reporters that the timing of his disclosure was not related to the bishops meeting on the family, but said he hoped it might add \"a Christian voice\" to the synod that is expected to address how the Church can better minister to the homosexual faithful.\n\"I came out. This is a very personal, difficult and tough decision in the Catholic Church's homophobic world,\" Charamsa said, and asked people to bear this in mind.\nHe said he has written a book in Italian and Polish to \"lay bare\" his experience \"in front of all those who want to confront me.\"\nCharamsa told the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza that he was motivated to make his sexual orientation public by hate mail that he received after publicly criticizing a right-wing Polish priest who is strongly anti-gay in the Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny.\n\"I have to say who I am. I am a gay priest. I am a happy and proud gay priest,\" he told Gazeta Wyborcza.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/25/5bef0636-2520-4161-a8e1-ae194f8796ed/thumbnail/220x140/a30c8498dc9b05a06a5d57bda02533b9/2015-09-23t202406z1277946087gf10000217560rtrmadp3-pope-usa.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:50:09.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
