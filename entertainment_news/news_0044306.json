The book reveals the significant possibilities of multiculturalism and also considers the long-range effects of a changing economic world in relation to Canada.\nWhen it comes to election day, the large number of political parties in the country is shown as a disadvantage for a federal election ever gaining a majority government receiving over 50 percent of the vote. Theoretically, in just a three-party race, one party could name the prime minister with just 34 percent support.\n\"Random Thoughts\" randomly throws light on many other subjects, including Canada’s much-touted health care system, and how Canada’s costly social programs can lead to a spiral of “thinning the wealth,” with government the main beneficiary. One chapter defines the relative strength of money, while another addresses the need for world cooperation in dealing with global warming. The author also asks why mankind has became confrontational over religious controversies. \"Random Thoughts\" offers an eye-opening look at the world’s many problems.\nWatch the video on the attached pdf or at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl0sFnFqAVE&feature=youtu.be\nAbout the Author: Raised in Cardiff, Wales, Don Chivers now calls White Rock, British Columbia home.
