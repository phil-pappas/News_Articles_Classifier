He was 83. \nWoods died Tuesday in Stroudsburg, Pa., said Philip Bensing, owner of the Bensing-Thomas Funeral Home. \nWoods gave his last concert Sept. 4 in Pittsburgh, using oxygen to complete a performance of the classic album “Charlie Parker With Strings” with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. That night he announced he had emphysema and was retiring. \nWoods grew up in the Swing Era where his early influences included alto saxophonists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges. He made his name as a fiery disciple of bebop pioneer Charlie “Bird” Parker. He was married to Parker’s widow, Chan, for 17 years. \nWoods released more than 50 albums as a leader and many more as a sideman with such jazz luminaries as Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk. He won four Grammys. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:32:41.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
