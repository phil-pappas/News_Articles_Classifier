The Matt Damon -starrer almost defeated \" Gravity \" to nab the biggest October opening of all time. Although \"The Martian\" now has the second-biggest October opening of all time, there's still a chance that when final numbers come, it can top the record holder, \"Gravity\", which opened to $55.8 million in 2013. \"Science is at the heart of 'The Martian' and is presented in a very accessible way,\" said Fox distribution chief Chris Aronson. \"This movie has the potential to get people excited about our space program again.\" Last weekend's champion, \" Hotel Transylvania 2 \", was down 32 percent, earning approximately $33 million for a domestic total of $90.5 million. The Dracula animated movie still shone, placing number two in the chart. This weekend's other new wide release, \" Sicario \", brought in around $12 million as it expanded from 59 to 2,620 theaters. The R-rated drug cartel action movie secured the third place, coming behind \"The Martian\" and \"Hotel Transylvania 2\". Nancy Meyers' comedy movie, \" The Intern \", added another $11.6 million for a domestic total of $36.5 million in its second weekend. Meanwhile, the latest installment of \" The Maze Runner \" movie series, \" Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials \", rounded out the top five with approximately $7.6 million for a domestic cume of $63.2 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:59:56.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
