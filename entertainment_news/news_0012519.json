And yes, you're right — middle school *is* more interesting than you remember, Loyal Reader. We'll also talk with Berry BANG co-sponsor and confessed \"giant geek\" Scott McClellan. And in reviews, we've got the new \"Uncanny Avengers\" and a few other interesting comics.\nVarious pieces of comic book merchandise line the shelves in Scott McClellan's sixth-grade language arts classroom at Berry Middle School in Hoover.

(photo by Kate Furek) THE SPLASH\nRece Stewart stood stiffy in the dying Indian summer sunlight, staring straight and answering questions with a succinct seriousness that impressed me.\n\"It's better than I expected it to be,\" he said. \"I thought it would be more...\"\nHe trails off. I had asked him what he thought about Berry Middle School, his new home as an 11-year-old sixth grader in Hoover.\nHe pauses, measuring his words.\n\"I don't want to be rude, but I thought the teachers would be different,\" he said.\n\"Meaner?\" I asked.\nHe nods.\nRece had just finished attending the year's third meeting of the Berry Comic Book and Novel Group, an afterschool club co-sponsored by one of those not-as-mean-as-he expected teachers, Scott McClellan. Before the meeting began, Rece returned a copy of \"Civil War\" to the club library curated by McClellan.\n\"I thought it was a very nice comic,\" Rece said. \"I liked all the details and pictures it gives. I usually watch the movies, so it was different for me to see [Captain America and Iron Man] fight against each other.\"\nWithout McClellan and BANG, there's a pretty decent chance that Rece would not have an opportunity to read the book, instead leaving him to experience the superhero-on-superhero violence with the rest of the unread masses in the \"Captain America: Civil War\" feature film. In talking about his language arts teacher, Rece called McClellan \"a big comic book geek.\"\n\"His whole room,\" Rece said, \"is comical-ized — if that's a word.\"\n***\nStudents watch Scott McClellan lecture on the history of Supergirl, Superman's cousin and the featured character in an upcoming CBS television series.

(photo by Kate Furek) McClellan, a sixth-grade language arts teacher at Berry since 2010, is in his fourth year as the co-sponsor of the BANG afterschool group. The club, he said, began naturally from his interest in comics.\n\"I knew that lots of kids were interested in the movies and the video games and TV shows,\" McClellan said. \"I wanted to funnel that into 'Let's talk about the books that all these things are based on.' That was actually a struggle the first couple of years because I had a lot of kids coming in and all they wanted to do was talk about the movies and the video games and the cartoons. It was 'Okay, that's fine,' but 'Let's talk about the comics that inspired them.'\"\nIn BANG's first year, McClellan said the group had about 10 or 15 regulars in the afterschool meetings. This year, however, the club has had 24 different students attend least one meeting, a growth McClellan attributes in part to his new co-sponsor, second-year seventh-grade language arts teacher Sarah Sansbury.\n\"I think them seeing a female teacher maybe makes some of them feel a little bit more comfortable,\" McClellan said. \"I had a group of girls the first year that were very into manga. Then it was a desert. It was boys for two years. I would talk to girls, and girls would come up and would have nerdy conversations with me — nerdy conversations like 'You know more than the boys that are in this club.' It was like, 'Why don't you come to the comic book club?' They said, 'Comic book club is for boys.'\"\nAt the club meeting on Tuesday, 11 students — seven boys and four girls — show up to McClellan's classroom. It is a room indeed \"comical-ized,\" as DC and Marvel posters adorn the walls and McClellan's own double-stacked miniature Batmobile collection runs the entire length of one shelf. This meeting is all about DC's Supergirl, the less famous cousin of Superman and the star of a new CBS show premiering Oct. 26.\nMcClellan, in black pants and a black polo shirt bearing the bright red \"Batman Beyond\" logo, lectures the group on Supergirl's history, from her debut (1959), to her feature film (1984), death (1985) and subsequent resurrection in the 1990s. He then shows the trailer for the CBS series and talks with the students afterward about what they expected and how they were surprised. He then — importantly — talks about individual characters that will be seen in the series and points to specific comic books and issues that highlight those characters.\nUltimately, as McClellan had already explained to me, it's about getting students to transition from enjoying movies, television shows and video games to reading comic books.\n\"It keeps on going back to reading,\" McClellan said. \"I want you reading. This is something that is fun for you to read, then read it and keep on reading. Of course, do I hope that they grow into big boy books? Yes, but you're never going to get there until you find out that reading is something fun. It's something that you intrinsically want to do. With comic books, I get everyone from the avid reader to the struggling reader to the reluctant reader, but I can get them all to read comic books.\n\"It's like the one ring: It binds us all together.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:16:36.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
