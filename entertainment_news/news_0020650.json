The nearby history center, however, is definitely open and a suitable place to showcase items from the iconic \"I Dream of Jeannie\" TV show, which aired from 1965-70.The staff at the Air Force Space and Missile Museum are such fans of \"I Dream of Jeannie,\" they want to share their exhibit with Brevard. They just had to move it first. \n\"It's kind of like the best kept secret in Brevard,\" Perry said of the space museum. In 2010, the Air Force Space and Missile History Center opened. \"It's a 3,200-square-foot facility that's got all kinds of exhibits, engines, nose cones, tons of photographs, and a really big gift shop.\" \nThe \"Jeannie\" exhibit coincides with a visit from actress Barbara Eden, who played the title role alongside co-star Larry Hagman as her love-interest/master, Major Tony Nelson. \nEden will be in Brevard on Oct. 25 to officiate the awards ceremony of the Ron Jon Cocoa Beach Half Marathon and for her performance, \"On the Magic Carpet with Barbara Eden\" at Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy in Melbourne. \nStory continues below \nAn \"I Dream of Jeannie\" exhibit is on display at the Air Force Space and Missile History Center.

She's been a friend to the museum and has been here several times in the past.\" Eden previously visited the space museum in June 1969, the same day she launched a weather rocket from the Cape, Perry added. Black-and-white photos from the museum archive show Eden standing in front of a \"genie\" missile. \nSome of the items on display include autographed photos by Eden, a genie bottle, Christmas ornaments, comic book covers, and an \"I Dream of Jeannie\" license plate. \nContact Sangalang at 321-242-3630", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:47:46.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
