It's terrifying.\nAs the native Alexandrians prove almost to a one to be unable to defend themselves – even Deanna (Tovah Feldshuh) pretty much decides to sit the fight out – Carol and Morgan (Lennie James) must fight off the marauders.\nProblem: They don’t agree on tactics.\nCarol believes in leaving no assailants behind; Morgan values life.\nCarol sees no choice but to kill.\n“Carol, you don’t like it,” Morgan says.\nThat hits a nerve.\nThey separate on their way to the armory. Carol knows she has to prevent the Wolves from reaching the guns.\nMorgan just has to rescue Father Gabriel . (Me at home: WHY?)\nAnd just when Morgan has the thug tied up nice and starts getting some answers, Carol stops by with a gun and shoots the Wolf dead just as casually as if she were stopping for some firewood.\nMorgan is better at convincing some Wolves to leave the compound with his “stick-fu.”\nBut one manages to take a firearm off a corpse before leaving. Oh, that's going to bite the survivors in the future.\nClearing out one house, Morgan is finally forced to take a life.\nHere's the irony for both Morgan and Carol: Both were right about the other.\nCarol knew it was either kill or be killed; Morgan knows the act of taking a life scars the soul forever. Both bear the psychic wounds of this raid.\nThey cross paths on a street strewn with corpses, never acknowledging the other.\nSo that \"lunch bell\" that drew the walkers off their path last week? A truck driven by the Wolves crashed into the wall, it’s airhorn blaring.\nDenise was a psychotherapist, but the death of the last physician has led to a career change. She’s played by “Nurse Jackie” Emmy winner Merritt Wever and we immediately love her and are desperately scared for her in this insane world. Her attempt to save the life of one bleeding resident goes about as badly as possible.\nThe initials JSS – “Just Survive Somehow” - a mantra Enid (Katelyn Nacon) relied upon, tracing the letters on a car window, on the ground, on her smudged hand.\nIt’s a whole teenage angst thing – just like the note and the disappearing act she pulls on Carl.\nKids.\nCan’t live with them, can’t leave ‘em out in the woods as walker bait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:29:55.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
