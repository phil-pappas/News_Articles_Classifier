Drake gets emotional (of course) in the lyrics to his song, Hotline Bling. \nThe clip is all about Drake’s dancing. His signature moves include pointing his fingers, sitting on a staircase and moving his shoulders, and at one point, semi-squatting while dragging his legs back and forth. \nHe’s been called “goofy”, “daggy” and “dorky” but he’s just being Drake. Call me ... Drake appears to be mining making a phone call with his hands. \nIf I saw a guy wearing a knitted skivvy dancing like this at the club, it would be a huge turn-off, unless that guy was Drake and that’s because Drake can get away with anything because he’s, well, Drake. HOTLINE BLING VIDEO \nHis dancing has been compared to Carlton’s moves from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Elaine’s from Seinfeld , spawning hilarious memes. PIZZA \nIn one of the memes, Hotline Bling is replaced with Latin music, so it looks like Drake is dancing a poorly-choreographed salsa. \nHotline Bling — which debuted on Apple Music — almost gave Drake his first No. 1 in the US (the song is currently No. 2 on the US Billboard chart behind The Weeknd’s The Hills ). The finger ... it’s doubtful Drake’s moves would work for anyone except Drake. \nIf the Hotline Bling clip (by Director X) doesn’t win video of the year at the MTV VMAs, Kanye West should crash the stage like he did when Taylor Swift beat Beyonce’s Single Ladies . \nSince the song was released a few months ago, I’ve analysed the lyrics searching for answers to WTF boy-related questions in my life. \nIt is rumoured that Drake, who has dated Rihanna and may be involved with Serena Williams right now, wrote the song about Instagram model, Nebby. Smooth ... here’s Drake making phone hands — again. All the single ladies ... one of Drake’s moves in the video for Hotline Bling. \nMaybe Drake broke up with a girl, she got over it, and he realised he still wanted her (boys, huh). \n“Ever since I left the city you got a reputation for yourself now. Everybody knows and I feel left out. Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out,” Drake raps. \n“Cause ever since I left the city, you started wearing less and goin’ out more ... Hangin’ with some girls I’ve never seen before.” \nDrake, can you call me on my cell phone? We need to talk. I feel like you’ll get it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:21:31.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
