The Great British Bake Off’s Nadiya (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \nShe said: “I went into the tent as the smallest baker at 4 ft 11 in but I walked out feeling a giant.” \nThe baker, who has become a social media sensation, said she hoped people would remember her baking abilities. \nThe 30-year-old from Leeds said: “I really hope that I have not become known more for my facial expressions or my eyebrows than my baking! \n“I had no idea that this would become a talking point on social media. The Great British Bake Off’s Nadiya’s famous eyebrows (Mark Bourdillon/BBC) \n“It’s all a bit of fun and not to be taken seriously, and I think it reflected what was going on in the tent.” \nNadiya impressed in the signature bake with her iced buns, half of them cardamom and almond, and half nutmeg and sour cherry. Promoted stories \nMary Berry called them “lovely”, while Paul Hollywood added: “Both of those tick the boxes.” \nA batch of raspberry millefeuille also earned her first place in the technical challenge. (BBC/Love Productions) \nIn the showstopper challenge, she created a My Big Fat British Wedding cake to make up for not having one at her marriage in Bangladesh. \nShe said: “The showstopper was a celebration cake – and as I never had my own wedding cake I wanted a proper iced wedding cake. \n“I bought a sari that was red, white and blue, in the colours of the Union Jack, and I decorated my stand with that. \n“My husband Abdal’s favourite cake is lemon drizzle, so I decided to make that. (BBC/Love Productions) \n“At the very end of the filming I took the cake out to my family’s table and we all had a slice. \n“So my husband and I did get our wedding cake after all.” \nShe said she had not imagined getting to the final in her “wildest dreams”. \nShe said: “On the day itself it was really still and quiet inside the tent. The Great British Bake Off finalists: Tamal, Nadiya, and Ian (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \n“There was a real sense of calm and concentration, it wasn’t just the bakers’ last day – it was everyone’s last day. \n“We all had a slight sense of sadness that it was all coming to a close. \n“As they announced the winner, all I remember is not wanting to look at anyone, so I looked down at my shoes, my heart was racing in my chest and I could hear it thudding in my head. \n“I remember seeing that my shoes were covered in flour, and when I heard my name, I covered my face with my hands as I didn’t want anyone to watch me cry.” \nLuton-born Nadiya hid the trophy so no-one would know she had won. (BBC/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon) \n“I wrapped it in many layers of brown paper, put it in a suitcase and hid it under the bed in case anybody saw it,” she said. \n“Now it can come out and take pride of place in our living room.” \nThe Bake Off’s previous winners – including Edd Kimber, John Whaite and Frances Quinn – have often been able to create careers out of their baking victory, writing cookbooks and cookery columns and making TV appearances. \nLooking to the future, Nadiya said: “Family life will carry on as normal. Nadiya’s children share a giggle in the final episode (BBC/Love Productions) \n“Being a mum to three small children under 10 is pretty time-consuming, but I wanted to have my own adventure. \n“With a very supportive husband and a belief in my own ability, I can now carry on having my adventure. \n“I am really looking forward to see what will happen.” \nBerry said: “I am really proud of Nadiya, not so confident to start with, but over the weeks she has grown in confidence. The Great British Bake Off’s Mary Berry (Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions) \n“She came into the tent for the final, and was nervous – but she had the look that said she can do it.” \nHollywood added: “All three bakers pushed the boat out for the final, but it’s all about keeping calm and being consistent throughout. \n“Nadiya has brought something special to the Bake Off. \n“Her ideas, flair, her emotions and her passion were all in her bakes, she just nailed the whole final. \n“That was the best-tasting final we have ever had.” Ian forgot his orange in his carrot cakes (BBC/Love Productions) \nIan struggled with his spiced buns with cardamom, cinnamon, and apple and cranberry jam, forgetting to add his sugar, although his elderflower and lemon buns went down well. \nHe came second in the technical challenge, before creating a five-part curry carrot cake as his showstopper. \nTamal struggled with timing on his cinnamon and apple, and toffee and marmalade iced buns. Tamal came third in the technical (BBC/Love Productions) Share article \nAfter coming last in the technical, his showstopper was a sticky toffee pudding cake with date and toffee sauce.
