All be it with a little less Lorne and Lester in the mix. The second season will be a prequel set in 1979 following central character Molly's father Lou Solverson when he was just 33 years old. (Molly will also be in it but as a four year old child.) Things kick off when an unexpected turn of events at a local diner disrupts the lives of the citizens of a small Minnesota town. Crackin' cast too including Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman and Ted Danson.
