The tour, hosted by Tarek Alharbi and Abdullah Alkassem, is billed as a comedic journey for Arabic speakers across the U.S., and is set to hit six cities around the country over the coming months.\nTarek Alharabi, also known as 6ar8o, and Abdullah Alkassem, known as BO8ATTE, are Saudi Arabia’s top ranking social media influencers, reaching a combined follower base of over three million. Together, the pair of comedians are bringing the Short & Chubby tour to Arabic-speaking university students and their families around the United States. The tour will cover topics including studying abroad and struggles faced by students in a foreign country.\n“Looking at the laughter in people’s faces is absolutely priceless, and it’s even better knowing that you put it there,” says Tarek. “We once did a comedy show in Los Angeles, and both the turnout and demand we saw proved that there is absolutely a market in the United States for the type of content we bring to the table,” adds Abdullah.\nThe Short & Chubby tour was created in affiliation with Direct Influence, a marketing agency that unites major social influencers with relevant brands and companies to achieve a common goal. Focusing around studying abroad, the company felt that pairing Tarek and Abdullah with Almosafer was a perfect fit.\n“We’re incredibly excited to help bring the Short & Chubby tour to the United States. We feel that the material and experiences discussed by Tarek and Abdullah is important for Saudi Arabian and GCC audiences in the U.S.,” says Farooq Aljeraisy, CEO of Almosafer. “Partnering with their team was an absolute no brainer.”\nThe Short & Chubby tour’s first stop will be at Metropolitan State University in Denver, Colorado.
