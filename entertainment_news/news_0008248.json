A number of other factors like the worldwide release of films and connect with the strong Malayali diaspora abroad are also crucial. Foreign subsidies and incentives too play an important part in luring filmmakers to exotic landscapes abroad not to mention the ‘freshness’ appeal. Recent releases like Madhura Naranga and Life of Josutty will be followed by upcoming films Two Countries, White, Puli Murugan and two untitled movies that have a large if not complete chunk of the film shot in exotic foreign locations. Life of Josutty, extensively shot in New Zealand, showcases its breathtaking landscape and postcard-like locations. Stating that the subject required the story to be set abroad and that the producers had a lot of contacts there, director Jeethu Joseph says: “I did not want the usual skyscraper visuals, but a countryside with a small township; New Zealand was the apt one.” On the advantages of shooting abroad, he says getting permissions is easy as complete professionalism is involved. “In Kerala, if we want to shoot a roadside scene in a remote area, we can just shoot but for such a scene in New Zealand, I had to inform the police department, follow a list of safety protocols they issue, including the crew donning a bright orange vest while shooting in public spaces. A safety officer will be present throughout the shoot and it is mandatory to get permission from shop owners before you shoot. Everything is by the book and has clarity though the cost of hiring equipment and technicians is very high,” he says. He remembers an incident during the shoot of Memories. “For Memories, I had to shoot a scene in a church in Kerala after paying money, but midway through, some locals barged in and shut the door. What is the point of the government taking money if the shoot is interrupted,” Jeethu asks. Uday Ananthan who is directing Mammootty and Huma Qureshi in White, to be shot in London, says shooting abroad is difficult. “The logistics in London is completely different from ours and unless you have a professional outfit, you won’t be able to shoot the content and visuals you have in mind,” he says. Shafi, who is directing Two Countries, has set the major portion of his film in Canada and he talks about the novelty of cashing in on beautiful locations. “This story can only happen abroad. We have shot at the Niagara Falls and other very scenic locations,” he explains. Shafi narrates a hilarious experience. “We were informed that the climate would be very cold so all of us packed winter and thermal wear, but to our surprise, when we landed there, we were welcomed by one of the hottest summers in 30 years! It was hotter than Kerala!” He too agrees with the advantages of shooting abroad. “There is always even light and no top light, so work becomes faster and the beauty of the frames become more vivid.” Some never-before-seen landscapes of Norway and Switzerland will form the backdrop of Roshni Dinakar’s Prithviraj musical. “My film is more like a fairytale, so I cannot set it in India. I need vast wilderness and outdoors. Norway has never been explored before and a particular location in Norway is a character in the film. The famous Northern Lights and a rock which is situated on high-risky ground are of prime importance in the film. Some unseen locales of Switzerland too will feature in the film,” Roshni states.\n entertainment Mollywood Life of Josutty New Zealand Mammootty Also Read Karan Johar’s Rs 3 crore song for Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya Finally!
