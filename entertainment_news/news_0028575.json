The future is here. \nThe second installment of the Back To The Future trilogy finds Marty McFly, portrayed by Michael J. Fox, time-traveling to Oct. 21, 2015.Among his discoveries are hand-held computers, video chatting, Major League Baseball in Miami, and a preponderance of cameras. \nBut what is life really like 30 years after the movie? \nFor all the guesses the movie got wrong, did it get anything right? \nMany still believe we'll see flying cars 30 years from now. Jonathan Moyer, the acting director of the Pardee Center for International Futures says not so much. \n\"I think that's been a prediction that's been wrong pretty consistently across time and I think it gets down to the physics,\" he said. \nMoyer said more driverless or driver-assisted cars could be on the roads in 30 years. \nSome predict technology will keep getting smaller, but Moyer said that may be tough to do. \n\"We're really not that great at making batteries as efficient but increasingly smaller as we are at making computers as powerful but increasingly smaller.\" \nFor what it's worth, Nike is bringing the future to us with some self-tying shoes. \nUSA TODAY was in the future. It still exists \n(Â© 2015 KUSA and USA TODAY) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1RXCm0V TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:40:57.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
