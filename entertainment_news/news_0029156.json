Though the play used fictional names as the story was partly fictional, it showed how Geeta, a noted singer, after her marriage to Guru, felt suffocated. She compares the actor-director to the king, who keeps a bird in the cage demanding it to sing only for him. She is disturbed by how her husband spends most of his time in the vanity van with a new heroine. She becomes an alcoholic and starts having flings. Guru, on the other hand, sees both his personal and professional life falling apart. His films get panned by the audience, and his protegees decide to work with other filmmakers. The play begins and ends with the same scene in which Guru commits suicide. \"I feel bad for her. I wish she was born in this era, where our emotions and priorities are more sorted and communicating things are much easier,\" said Sonali about the character she essayed. Arif said that his character has many layers and he gets to discover a new facet of it with every performance.\nBETWEEN ALL SHER-O-SHAYARIS AND POEMS\nThe second play , Ek Mulaqaat didn't use any fictitious names while narrating the love affair between lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi and poetess Amrita Pritam. Deepti Naval played the female protagonist and Shekhar Suman as Sahir mouthed some of the nazms and shers penned by the lyricist. The play starts with Amrita getting a missed trunk call from Bombay . In her room, talking to an illusion of Sahir, she says that she doesn't know anybody expect him in Bombay . The rest of the play a conversation between the two. Most of Sahir's answers come in form of shayari , while Amrita occasionally sings her Punjabi poems. The play ends with another trunk call, this time Amrita receives it only to learn that Sahir is no more. \"I feel so connected to Sahir that I think if he wouldn't have said all those things, I would have,\" said Shekhar. Deepti said, \"It is my first ever play. I am excited to play this character because I have known Amrita personally and she has always inspired me.\"\nFICTION PLUS REALITY\nBoth the plays were directed by Saif Hyder Hasan, which he wrote along with Summana Ahmed. \"I had read so much about Guru Dutt that I wanted to make a play on his life.The reason that the first play is part fiction is because you don't know what goes on behind closed doors but in the second play you have Amrita's writings where she spoke at length about Sahir,\" said Saif. Apart from acting, the music in the both the plays was by Parivesh Singh.\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Theatre news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:48:40.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
