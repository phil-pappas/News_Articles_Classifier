Names of those killed have not been released. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said Thursday night it would be at least Friday before identities would be made public.\n\"Obviously, notifications of the families is our priority, and we would ask that media respect the victims and their families as they manage these most difficult hours,\" Hanlin said.\nUSA TODAY\nTen killed in shooting at Ore. community college\nUSA TODAY\nSheriff in Oregon mass shooting probe opposes gun control\nUSA TODAY\nAndy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war\nUCC student Brittany Eggers, 18, said she was a couple of buildings away from the shootings.\nNarci Quintara, an Umpqua Community College student, holds a candle during a vigil at Stewart Park in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015.

Shortly after that, she said, the building was locked down.\nStudents were searched twice, then allowed onto buses to be driven to the Douglas County fairgrounds to reunite with family, she said.\nEggers said she was overwhelmed by attendance at the vigil. Although she grew up in the city, she said, “I didn’t really know how tight a bond Roseburg has.”\nUmpqua Community College President Dr. Rita Cavin speaks during a vigil at Stewart Park in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015.
