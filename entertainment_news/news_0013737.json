Image 38 of 38 Grammy-winning artist St. Vincent spent her weekend waiting tables at a Texas taqueria 1 / 38 Back to Gallery It’s not every day you can order tacos via Grammy-award winning artist, St. Vincent, but in the “strange world” that is Texas, anything is possible.\nIt’s exactly what customers of Resident Taqueria, a new Dallas restaurant owned by the musician’s family, experienced this weekend.\n“It’s an honor to be part of the Resident Taqueria opening weekend. #Dallas #tacos #LakeHighlands,” the Digital Witness singer tweeted .\nThe Dallas native was modest as to how much she was a “part of,” in the opening of her sister’s business. She tied on an apron to serve up tacos and margaritas, customers on social media reported.\nRELATED: Serena Williams takes Texas: floats San Marcos River, watches Drake at Austin City Limits\nAnnie Clark, who uses the stage name St. Vincent, is not quitting her day job of touring, singing and writing award-winning music to wait tables in her hometown, though. A Resident Taqueria manager told E! Online that St. Vincent was just lending a hand.\n“She was our bartender and our server all weekend,” the staff member told the publication. “She was just doing it as an excellent sister and knew we needed the help.”\nThe musician paused clearing tables and taking orders to pose for photos posted to social media.\nTom Steele, an editor at the Dallas Morning News, thanked the Digital Witness singer for her customer service.\n“@st_vincent thank you for refilling out napkin dispenser last night, he tweeted . “@spants she was WORKING. clearing tables. restocking Topo Chico […] this is a strange world.”\nmmendoza@mysa.com\nTwitter: @MaddySkye", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/76/8777601/4/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/tomsteele/status/652476434112364544",
