As an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and motivator, she took being a witness to cultural, domestic, and financial tumult and converted what she learned into a motivational tool to fight victimhood. Walker went from being a struggling teen bride, to a divorced mother of four, to a trailblazer who has over the past 25 years built thriving enterprises; including a 24-hour day care center, multiple real estate holdings, a record label, and state-of-the-art recording studio-all while becoming a self-made millionaire. \nHer renowned Tennessee based RainbowKidz Learning Center is currently expanding into a national brand, while Walker is being busily pursued as a motivating life coach, with personal stories that demonstrate that anything is possible. For over the past two decades her philanthropic, hands-on support has helped turn hardworking individuals into successful business owners; providing them with step-by-step guidance on how to start a business, hire employees, manage a budget, select locations, and take advantage of marketing to realize their full earning potential. \nThe experience of being in an abusive relationship, both mental and physical, allowed her a keen sense for spotting those in similar crisis, and out of this has grown yet another community supportive enterprise at Walker’s helm: the BE (Blind Eye) Foundation, whose mission and motto is to “ BE the difference and not turn a Blind Eye to society. ” With the impact of her encouraging words and motherly guidance-often delivered through her sassy, tell-it-straight, southern style-she is using the BE foundation to launch ongoing, nationally aired PSA’s that will weave a true picture of domestic violence-chronicling the cycle of abuse from male and female perspectives. Not only will her media campaign shine the light on often undiscussed areas of abuse, she will narrate solutions, encouraging a way out of victim-hood. \nWalker describes what is at the heart of her support system, \n“ I consider myself a motivator-not a motivational speaker. Everyone has a story. Everyone goes through trials and tribulations. I don’t speak to or at people. I communicate and connect with them instead. I help others with good old fashioned advice-financially, socially, mentally, and spiritually. I motivate people to get up and achieve their goals, start that new business, go after that promotion. How to tell that woman or man you want to get to know them or how to leave that bad relationship. I’ve been there. I motivate people to stop making excuses, stop saying ‘can’t do’, and I’m going to use all my experiences to show you how .” \nKatrina Walker has taken adversity and transformed her life into a true American success story. She now continues on her mission to help others find their own positive transformations. \nWalker is writing her memoir with award-winning journalist Clarence Waldron, former Jet senior writer and editor, who was mentored by the late best-selling author and poet, Dr. Maya Angelou.
