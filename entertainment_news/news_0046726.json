READ MORE: \nThe presenter has been rumoured for ‘I’m A Celeb’ multiple times, and even had a place on last year’s line-up, before pulling out at the last minute. \nHowever, it sounds like ITV have finally snagged Rustie for the new series. \nRustie Lee \nA source tells The Sun: “Rustie is larger than life and everyone knows who she is. She’s bubbly and fun and will have a huge presence in the jungle.” \nIn addition to her presenting career, and stints on reality shows like ‘I’m Famous And Frightened’ and ‘Celebrity Super Spa’, Rustie also had a short-lived career in politics, joining UKIP in 2004, and unsuccessfully standing for election within the party in 2009. \nPrior to Rustie being listed as a potential campmate, other celebrities tipped to be taking part include Spencer Matthews and Leslie Ash , while ‘EastEnders’ actor Jake Wood has also expressed interest in appearing. \nAmong the slightly more far-fetched rumoured stars are Caitlyn Jenner and Tom Daley , with ‘X Factor’ winner James Arthur denying his involvement in the forthcoming series. \nCheck out all of this year’s rumoured participants below... Close 'I'm A Celebrity' 2015: All The Rumours So Far... of   Rumours recently suggested that Spencer was leaving 'Made In Chelsea', with his first venture away from the SW4 gang being a stint on 'I'm A Celeb'. If he needs some tips, he could always ask Hugo Taylor, who appeared on the show in 2012. After shying away from the public in the years since her MRSA diagnosis, reports recently claimed that Leslie was hoping to give her career a boost with an appearance on 'I'm A Celebrity'. A year after stunning us all with his 'Strictly Come Dancing' appearance, Jake has said that he'd like to appear on 'I'm A Celebrity', during his forthcoming year off from 'EastEnders'. Last year, Denise said she would love to take part in the next series of 'I'm A Celebrity', but admitted she wouldn't fancy tucking into any creepy-crawlies, saying: \"I couldn’t do the eating trials but I could do everything else.\" After insisting that his previous controversies are now long in his past, could this 'X Factor' winner use an appearance on 'I'm A Celebrity' to prove to the public he's turned over a new leaf? Having already won 'Celebrity Big Brother' in 2013, Charlotte has said that she'd love to give the jungle a try, but claims ITV producers are less enthused. She told 'Lorraine' back in August: \"I’d really love to go into the jungle now - but I don’t think they’d have us. “They said they don’t want anyone from 'Geordie Shore'.\" True, he's rumoured for practically every reality show every year, but thanks to the new 'Gascoigne' documentary, he's back in the public eye and doing well - but will 'I'm A Celebrity' producers try and capitalise on that? Oh it's probably happening, isn't it? Reports have claimed that Gemma was torn between an appearance on 'CBB' and a return to 'I'm A Celeb', and given the notable absence of GC in the Borehamwood bungalow this year, there's a fair chance she'll be back Down Under for a repeat performance later in the year. Craig, on the other hand, has already said he won't be returning to the jungle this year. He quit last year's series after learning about the death of his brother. However, he's also insisted that he wouldn't rule it out in the future. Now this might seem like a long shot, but Caitlyn actually appeared on the US version of the show way back in 2003, when she was still known to the public as Bruce Jenner, and finished in fourth place. True, it's unlikely she'll be in the jungle this year - but we can dream, can't we..? Another star who's rumoured for 'I'm A Celebrity' every year, Tom has been listed by http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/x-factor-star-james-arthur-6359781 as a potential campmate for this year's series. A former 'Love Island' contestant, niece of Linford Christie and mother to David McIntosh's child, it's hard to choose exactly which Z-list strand to lead with when it comes to Rachel, but she's reportedly been in talks to appear on 'I'm A Celeb' too, according to the Daily Star. Ronan's rumoured appearance on the show also seems to have come out of nowhere, with The Mirror again naming him as a potential star in this year's series. Sadly, the former 'The Weakest Link' host has said she has no interest in appearing on 'I'm A Celeb', despite constant offers from producers. Anne says she even once turned down an offer of £500,000 to join the show. Similarly, former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has also said he turned down 'I'm A Celeb'. He's got a lot of time on his hands now, though, so maybe he'll reconsider... Curiously, former 'X Factor' auditionee-turned-businesswoman-and-model, Chloe 'Dern't Be Taaaht This Is Meh Laaaf' Mafia has all but offered herself on a plate to producers ahead of the new series. A spokesperson for Chloe told The Mirror (seemingly out of nowhere!): \"Chloe loves reality TV shows and is a big fan of 'Celebrity Big Brother' and 'The Jump'... She's a fan of I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here and would do it if she were asked.\" Another former 'CBB' winner, rumoured 'I'm A Celeb' contestant Alex Reid is a reality TV dream contestant in our eyes. Earlier this year, it was claimed that Jamelia was torn between appearing on 'I'm A Celeb' and 'Strictly'. Obviously, she eventually plumped for the latter, but if she's booted off the dance floor in the early stages, perhaps it won't be too late for her to head to the jungle.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:18:17.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
