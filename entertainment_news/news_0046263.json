Francis Maguire reports.   \nIt's finally here... The video for Sam Smith's new James Bond theme has dropped. \"Writing's on the Wall\" is for the upcoming \"Spectre\". Smith is the latest singer to perform a Bond theme, following on from Adele's track for \"Skyfall\". But he's the first artist to ever reach number one in the UK with a Bond song. The video gives a couple of hints as to what might happen in Sam Mendes' latest Bond flick. The spy is seen in a passionate clinch with a character played by Monica Bellucci. And it appears he's working with Lea Seydoux's Madeleine Swann. Whoever find themselves on Bond's side this time around will have to deal with a mysterious villain played by Oscar winner Christoph Waltz. \"Spectre\" is released in the UK on October 26.  //reut.rs/1MbaMsg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:27:41.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
