He then asked the group to collaborate. \nSmith raps in both English and Spanish on the song. He recently shot a music video for the remix. \n“Fiesta” is nominated for record of the year at next month’s Latin Grammy Awards. Bomba Estereo’s album, “Amanecer,” is up for best alternative music album. \nBomba Estereo members are singer Liliana Saumet, drummer Andrés Zea and multi-instrumentalists Simon Mejia and Julian Salazar.
