Lovatos latest album, Confident,?is her fifth studio album and perhaps will move her into the spotlight. Until now, her music hadnt truly struck a chord with me. I could take her or leave her, the music just didnt go anywhere for me. It might be that she tried too hard to make herself believable, only adding to the manufactured mix. The single Cool For The Summer was different. I heard the song and didnt even realize it was her. It was strong, direct, and her vocals blared as if she were singing from a bullhorn. Confident is an appropriate title for where her career is. She no longer needs to appeal only to teeny-boppers. Now she can make music that doesnt have to pigeonhole her into one demographic. The title track is the second single from the new album, which boasts 11 strong radio-friendly songs. Confident, the song, carries the same boldness that sold Cool For The Summer to me. Where did this incredible voice come from? Lovato has always sported a big mouth. Cases in point: her previous hits Skyscraper, Give Your Heart A Break and Heart Attack. But theres a certain, well, confidence, to her vocal styling not heard before now. Thankfully, its present throughout the album. Waitin For You is a sure-fire single-worthy track in which Lovato sings, Knuckles out and a guard in my mouth/When youre hungry for the next round/Ill be waitin for ya! Add a ring and bring on Ronda Rousey and we just might have a fight Rousey cant win. Old Ways, Lionheart and Stone Cold are equally good, as is the pairing of Lovato with rapper Iggy Azalea on Kingdom Come. I know Iggy hast some haters, but I find her artistic angst refreshing compared to that of Nicki Minaj. Lovato was right to work with Iggy here. Lovato can definitely sing and sing hard, but its encouraging to know she can tone it down a notch or two and carry a ballad better than most of her contemporaries. For You is a nice attempt at a love song. Lovato seems sincere in her delivery. The album closes with the best song of her career thus far: Father is a beautiful, gospel-tinged ballad in which Lovato sings in tribute to her late dad. Father illustrates another level of confidence in Lovato, too  songwriting. The lyricism is so powerful that you can feel the hurt she has held in for years, as she sings, Father, Im gonna say thank you/Even if Im still hurt/Oh, Im gonna say bless you/I wanna mean those words. Page 2 of 2 - This will be the song to turn heads of other artists and finally see her as legit. I know you were a troubled man/I know you never got the chance/To be yourself, To be your best/I hope that heavens giving you, a second chance  How many of us have felt this way about someone and never knew how to put it into words? Father is perfect 10. Contact David T.
