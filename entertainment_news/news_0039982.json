Ms. Universe Philippines 2015 Pia Wurtzbach assists beneficiaries from SOS Childrens’ Village in a thanksgiving party hosted by Pizza Hut Cebu City and Binibining Pilipinas \nThe Philippine Pizza Inc. brands brought the spirit of Christmas early by hosting separate parties with the 2015 winners of Binibining Pilipinas for the children from the Community of Theresian Missionaries of Mary in Cagayan De Oro City and the beneficiaries of SOS Children’s Village in Cebu City. \n“We began Queens Give Back in Metro Manila last year by bringing our favorite beauty queens to hospital and school visits, where they could share a fun day with children in need of cheer,” shared Lorent Adrias, senior marketing manager for Philippine Pizza Inc. “This time we decided to take it further by reaching out to communities that have supported us in Visayas and Mindanao, specifically the hometowns of our Binibining Pilipinas winners, as our way of giving back after having a great year,” he added. (L-R) Binibining Pilipinas 2015 winners Ms. Universe Philippines Pia Wurtzbatch, Ms. Intercontinental Philippines Christi McGarry, Ms. International Philippines Janicel Lubina and Ms. Supranational Philippines Rogelie Catacutan with SOS Children’s Village beneficiaries in Pizza Hut Cebu City \nIt was an early Christmas treat indeed for the 100 children who saw their favorite Binibining Pilipinas winners, among them Ms. International Philippines 2015 Janicel Lubina and Ms. Intercontinental Philippines 2015 Christi McGarry, join in their fun and games. The Binibini Queens also distributed toys, notebooks, crayons and pencils as presents. Each visit was capped by a storytelling session, led by Ms. Universe Philippines 2015 Pia Wurtzbach in her native Cagayan de Oro, and by Ms. Supranational Philippines 2015 Rogelie Catacutan in her birthplace of Cebu. \nThe Binibining Pilipinas Queens themselves were not immune to the laughter and smiles of the children, with Rogelie Catacutan finding herself more excited to compete now that she had found the best support group in the children who wished them luck. “I miss Cebu a lot and I’m very grateful for (my hometown’s) support, so now it’s my turn to give back and share my blessings,” she said. “I’m thankful that Pizza Hut has given full support to this outreach program, which is important to me, and I’m also happy to share my hometown to my fellow Binibining Pilipinas winners.” \nIt was particularly special for Pia Wurtzbach, whose hometown visit doubled as her birthday celebration: “I’ve been extremely blessed this year having won the crown that I’ve worked hard for, and that opened a lot of doors for me. When I won this title I became a part of the Philippine Pizza (Inc.) family, which allowed me to give back to my beloved hometown.” She happily added, “Seeing the kids smile and spending my day with them is the best birthday gift ever!” \nLearn more about the Queens Give Back outreach program by following Pizza Hut Philippines on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/pizzahutphilippines.
