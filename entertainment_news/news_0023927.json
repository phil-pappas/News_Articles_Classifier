Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Patrick James Doyle’s profound tale portrays the beauty of life and self-worth.\nThe union of the circle is a story about a troubled small town teen named Jonathan, who is dealing with the loss of his mother. He finds himself under the parental guidance of an abusive stepfather and older brother. Jonathan engages in drug use and constant fighting in school, which soon escalades out of control. He escapes the complexities of his life by imagining and drawing a distant world known only as “The Land of Mist and Mountain.” Jonathan soon has a falling out with his friends and losses another in a fatal car accident. He soon spirals downward as a series of events provoke him into the thought of suicide. During his attempt, Jonathan transports across the cosmos and finds himself in the “Land of Mist and Mountain.” A prophecy spoke of Jonathan’s arrival over a thousand years prior and Korum, a sinister overlord searched for him. Korum plans to destroy the young man and control the world.\nWith a host of characters, Jonathan will learn about an ancient foretelling and eventually realize he is in his own imagining. He must confront the dark lord and bring balance back to the world. Only by securing an army can he unite the distant lands under a single banner. He must overcome the evil by conquering formidable opponents and uniting a new circle of friends. Will he take his rightful place in bringing a morality back and restore the world, or will the evil Korum and his sadistic minions find him first? Join in the great journey, which will span oceans and continents alike as Jonathan finds out the truth of who he is.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “The Land of Mist and Mountain” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
