How would it be possible for TVD to survive when they removed the one thing that kills both supernatural and mortal creatures alike? Well, I've got good(ish) news for you: I'm (cautiously) optimistic after this week's premiere. Yes, some of the chemistry, the love, and the plot continuity (lololol) was gone. Yes, it sometimes felt like I was being bombarded with too many new characters (CW pretty people are not so easy to tell apart, you know). But I could feel the inklings of some Caroline and Bonnie badass-ness to come. Here are eight ways The Vampire Diaries stayed the same (and a few ways it changed) in a post-Elena world.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 1. It still revolves around Elena.\nWe begin with Caroline and Bonnie writing in their diaries to Elena. Toward the end, Stefan says he tried to protect Mystic Falls because he knows it's what Elena would want and, thus, what Damon should want. Damon obviously can't stop talking about how he's doing horribly without his true love.\nA difference: You get the feeling it's not going to be about Elena forever. The main purpose of the diary writing was to give viewers exposition very, very quickly. After all, these diary entries weren't exactly brimming with emotion. They were plot, plot, plot.\nMore From Cosmopolitan 2. Bonnie is still doing it for herself.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail CW Can we just talk about Bonnie's vacation style forever? She looked so good. The episode could have used a few shots of her dreamily walking down a Parisian street, eating a croissant, catching the eye of a longhaired lothario.\nA difference: There are also so many new characters. Did anyone else feel whiplash from the speed they introduced all these new heretics? The scene where Valerie lists their names and one personality trait (\"Stoic Beau,\" \"Nora, brat\") is so comical and confusing. Anyway, they said each name like a million times this episode (Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm) and I still only kind have an idea who each is. That said, I know they are basically bitchy \"teens\" (the guys are probably older) and they felt familiar (*cough* Knockoff Originals *cough*).\n3. The whole universe is still governed by some pretty arbitrary rules\nWhy was it that easy for Damon to kill Malcolm? (And screw this show forever for making me learn his name only for them to instantly kill him.) Does pulling a heart out work on everyone? I mean, sure, it seems pretty hard to come back from (unless you watch Once Upon a Time ), but they did survive an explosion. Is he gonna come back?\nAlso, we were introduced to some new magic stone thing that does something. ​Entertainment Weekly ​'s Julie Plec called it a \" Phoenix Stone .\" We probably will find out more about it after some long monologue in a few episodes.\nAnd, well, because we're on the subject, wasn't it bizarre that Alaric kept striking out with psychics? I mean, you can't throw a rock in Mystic Falls without hitting a supernatural creature. Why was it so hard for him to find a real witch/psychic/something that could help him in Europe? Why didn't he just head to New Orleans to find someone to resurrect Jo?\nI hope Jo comes back.\n4. Caroline can still tango with the best of 'em.\nMy dearest Caroline, it's been a long summer without you. Yes, the bomb plan was dumb, but it was so much fun to see her acting all neighborly and faux-interested in the heretics' house while helping plant a bomb in it to destroy them. Even when she was pretending to be compelled (She was pretending, right?), you still could feel \"I'm winning this\" oozing out of every part of her. (She didn't actually win. But, whatever, the season is still young.)\n4. It's still all about the relationships.\nAny scene with the core four felt so cozy and right. How great was it to see Caroline and Stefan being all pining and awkward?\nAnd then there's Bonnie and Damon; I'm sort of all in on Bamon. OK, they're best friends and if they stay that way, it's fine. But imagine the sex they would have. It's not hard if you think about their passionate bickering and just imagine it closer, in a bed (or wherever). Either way, good on Bonnie for being like, \"Stop reminding me I'm the reason my best friend is not around.\" And good on Damon for being like, \"You're my best friend, I prob won't let you die.\" Related: Elena gave Damon the go-ahead to date other people. Wouldn't it be great to see them in therapy in the finale with Elena being like, \"When I said 'other people,' I didn't mean my best friend\"?\nLastly, there's a new heretics couple, who you saw holding hands.\nBoy, am I excited to see what happens with them. Two of the heretics being in a relationship really ups the stakes. All I want now is to learn more about how they met, fell in love, how they resisted and then gave in. Also, let's be real: One of them is gonna die before the other. Sorry, sorry, I had to say it.\n5. Mystic Falls is still a nightmare town.\nMan, did they keep the violence! Someone's head splatters and that's, like, a light moment. The heretics, none too happy with being blown up, go to Matt's police academy graduation and wreak havoc. Speaking of…\n6. Matt still has the worst life.\nAmong the awful things that could happen to a person: Almost all the people you've gone to school with, people you feel comfortable trusting with your life, people who you plan to face danger with every day, get slaughtered in front of you and you are helpless to stop it. This is Matt's reaction.\nAlso, how the heck did Matt not die? I assume perpetually single heretic (Valerie) saw him and was like, \"I can't destroy a work of art. A monster still has to have some honor.\" Which reminds me...\n7. People are still really horny.\nAfter the slaughter, Caroline and Stefan have a scene where they are sad but also you can tell they just want to rip each other's clothes off.\nThen later, I had to preserve this amazing Quote: from Caroline: \"I am happy. You make me happy. My best friend's gone. My mom's dead. The whole town is destroyed. But when I'm with you, I'm happy.\"\nI mean, if they weren't able to say things like this by season seven, all these characters would just be in an asylum somewhere rocking back and forth, so … fine. I accept it. Stefan is dreamy. Steroline is on. Kiss away.\n8. Damon's still … complicated.\nWho else was pissed that after the three-year time jump we see Damon in a coffin and mad that he was woken up before Elena was back? How about you help out and not chump out? Dammit bro, you're immortal. Pull it together. Sure, Damon feels and feels hard, but he did a major thing that Elena didn't want him to do after, like, so little time. Still, maybe there's an OK explanation for this, so I can't be too harsh.\nNext week: Caroline gets tortured. And while there's nothing I want to see less than my beautiful princess Caroline in pain, it looks like there's gonna be some pretty funny back-and-forths between Caroline and the bitchy heretics. Hopefully, my beautiful witch princess Bonnie can save her Best Friend (female category). That's what Bonnie does. And let's have Bonnie get some this season. She deserves it!\n​Follow Sarah on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sarahccaldwell", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x542/gallery-1444405362-tumblr-nvybuqv58x1rwsimjo1-1280.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x424/gallery-1444405362-tumblr-nvybuqv58x1rwsimjo1-1280.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444405362-tumblr-nvybuqv58x1rwsimjo1-1280.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x353/gallery-1444405362-tumblr-nvybuqv58x1rwsimjo1-1280.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444405362-tumblr-nvybuqv58x1rwsimjo1-1280.jpg", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/08/vampire-diaries-premiere-julie-plec-blog", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x265/gallery-1444405362-tumblr-nvybuqv58x1rwsimjo1-1280.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:06:21.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
