The actress is said to be feeling thrilled that her newlywed daughter has found the love of her life. \"She is very happy for Bella,\" a source close to Kidman told PEOPLE of the 48-year-old movie beauty. \"She, like all mothers, wants her child to be happy, and it surely seems Bella is very happy,\" added the source. Bella, who is a West London's Delmar Academy of Make-up and Hair graduate, married British I.T. consultant Max Parker on Sept. 18 after less than a year of dating. Kidman, Tom Cruise , and Connor, were all absent from the festivities, which took place at The Dorchester Hotel in Central London. Cruise and Kidman's absence from Bella's wedding was understandable as she reportedly wanted a low-key and intimate celebration. It was reported that despite not attending the wedding, Cruise did foot the bill. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:00:50.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
