But as a denizen of the Indian subcontinent for the previous four decades and more, I have had it drummed into me and my siblings that that adage was indeed so.\nOur sainted father would often make us kids drink, first thing in the morning, a bitter brew of a herbal leaf called “chirota” soaked overnight in water. It was supposed to be a sure-shot blood purifier, to say the least.\nKarela is an Indian vegetable, available here in Indian groceries, prized by aficionados for its bitter taste. Photo by GHOLAM RAHMAN And that wasn’t the lone scourge for us brood of kids. On the lunch table, too, there were always one or two “saag” (leafy greens) and “sabzee” (vegetables) dishes that incorporated the bitter taste, often moderated and complemented by other sensations such as sweet, salty and even sour – fried onions, generous amounts of salt and a touch of sugar and tamarind paste.\nFor people from that part of the world, a tolerance – even liking and love – for things bitter is in our collective psyche. Things that we hanker for, from time to time – not because they are good for our health but because they satisfy some subliminal taste sensation. We love arugula and chicory in salads and my wife, Kaisari, makes a mean “saag” dish of Italian broccoli raab. But …\nThe other day, however, we spotted something in Apna Bazaar (561-967-7193), an Indian grocery on Military Trail in West Palm Beach, that sparked an instant memory of our erstwhile home, in Dhaka, now the capital of Bangladesh. It was karela, also known as bitter melon with the scientific name of Momordica charantia – a mouthful as most such nomenclatures are. It is the fruit – yes bitter fruit – of a tropical climber, a native of the subcontinent that has spread to China, all over Southeast Asia and even to the Caribbeans and the Middle East.\nThe 6-inch-long cucumber-shaped vegetables (yes we consider them veggies just like tomatoes, despite what the scientists contend) in the shop’s bin had vibrant green color and those typical tooth-like warts and ridges all over the skin. They looked fresh and obviously locally grown by people in diaspora who crave for their bitter taste and see a business opportunity in them as well.\nWe snapped up several, and below is the result Kaisari cooked up – a simple peasant dish, wart and all with their alluringly bitter notes. Bhaji is a class of dish where veggies are sliced and cooked in a curried sauce, often on the dry side.\nKARELA BHAJI\n2 to 3 fresh karelas\n2 to 3 onions\n3 to 4 tablespoons oil\n1 to 1½ teaspoons salt\nhalf teaspoons sugar\n1. Wash and pat dry the karelas. Trim ends and divide them in half lengthwise, using a sharp knife. Scoop out the seeds and the pith around the seeds, leaving a thin layer of the white. Lay the boat-like halves on a cutting board, upside down, and slice very thinly. Cut the onions in half lengthwise and slice thinly, too.\n2. In a large heavy skillet, heat the oil and fry the onions over medium heat with half teaspoon salt, stirring frequently until the slices take on a medium golden color, Push onions to one side and add the sliced karelas. Raise heat slightly and stirring frequently, saute the karela slices until slightly softened. Stir the onions in, cover the skillet, reduce heat and cook until the karelas are just al dente, 7 to 9 minutes.\n3. Uncover, add the sugar, raise the heat to medium high and saute until the karela slices take on a fried color around the edges and the onions are dark brown and sweet. Tilt the pan to drain any excess oil. Serve hot with boiled basmati rice as a lunch first course.\nNOTE: Many cooks add a sweet-and-sour sauce made out of a teaspoon or two of tamarind pulp dissolves in a similar amount of water and sugar. It is added just before the pot is covered. This moderates the bitterness. Some cooks also salt, wash and drain the sliced karelas before cooking for the same purpose.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/12/14/c6/Gholam-Karela-101415.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:05:30.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
