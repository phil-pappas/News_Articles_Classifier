As someone who struggled with his faith after converting, S.T. Stone wasn’t always certain where his journey would take him. Yet with time, Stone found his spiritual path and hopes his experiences will serve as a guiding light for other new converts in his book, “Stepping Out.”\n“After my initial conversion I felt spiritually uncertain, and I came to realize that many other new converts felt the same way. In that moment, I understood that God wanted me to help others navigate the same waters he was leading me through,” Stone said.\nServing as a stepping-stone for new converts, “Stepping Out” is meant as a tool for evangelical groups and churches to put in the hands of spiritual novices while simultaneously advocating change in the Christian community as a whole. Drawing from his own observations and experiences over the years, Stone encourages all Christians to walk closer to God and remember to apply God’s word in their daily lives.\n“Conversion is only the first step toward salvation for a new believer. Knowledge and application of God’s word has been waning. We need to put God back in his proper place. Only then can he truly lead us,” Stone said.\nStepping Out\nBy S.T. Stone\nISBN: 9781490883625\nAvailable in softcover, hardcover, e-book\nAvailable on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and WestBow Press\nAbout the author\nS.T. Stone is an ordinary man who lives in a typical small town with his best friend of thirty-two years. Although he has no formal training, he loves the Lord and steadfastly maintains that “Christianity is not a religion; it is a relationship. You can’t serve Jesus Christ unless you love Him, and you can’t love Him unless you know Him. Our job is to help folks get to know Jesus. God will do the rest.”\n# # #\n**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**\nFor review copies or interview requests, contact:\nCraig Cainkar\n(317) 275-2067\nccainkar(at)bohlsengroup(dot)com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:07:58.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
