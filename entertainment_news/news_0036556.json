He's such an amazing guy. He told me he's always tried to help out homeless people in Manchester, but wanted to do more.\"He knows we'll look after the building and make proper use of it until the building work starts. This isn't a long-term thing, but we'll have so much going on in here to help people.\"It's exactly what Manchester needs right now.\"Neville bought the building with Giggs two years ago for a reported £1.5 million, and the new development will contain 35 bedrooms, plus a private members' club, gym and rooftop bar.Manchester Angels plans to set up a kitchen at the building offering hot meals, and have also said they will provide practical support for the city's homeless including health checkups, benefits advice and workshops to help homeless people secure jobs and permanent accommodation.On Neville's part, The Guardian reports that he sees this act as an extension of the support he's offered to homeless people over the last 10 years, saying: \"From my point of view, I'm quite relaxed about this.\"Neville and Giggs will feature alongside fellow Manchester United teammates Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt in a new spinoff documentary series Class of 92: Out of Their League on BBC One later this month.The two-part series charts the former footballers as they took over control of local club Salford City FC last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:16:08.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
