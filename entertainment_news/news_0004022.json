The Bachelorette contestant Alex Cameron. Channel 10 Cars For Sale \nDAPPER English bachelor Alex Cameron was eliminated from The Bachelorette tonight. \nFrost said she couldn't see a future with the charming and generous 35-year-old, the oldest of her remaining suitors. \nCameron made his exit graciously, telling Frost she made him hopeful that the right girl for him was out there. \n\"She is such a great girl,\" he said. \n\"I could see a future with her but unfortunately it was not meant to be for me. \n\"I wish I got to spend a bit more time with Sam so she got to see the fun side of my personality. She saw my more gentleman side on most dates.\" \nTonight's episode saw 26-yaer-old Frost travel the country to meet the families of the four remaining men: Cameron, Michael Turnbull, Richie Strahan and Sasha Mielczarek.

Channel 10 \nFrost played soccer with Turnbull and went on a river cruise with him in Brisbane. \nShe went surfing with Bondi-based Cameron and took in the sights of Perth with Strahan before being grilled by his protective friends. \nHer most romantic hometown visit, though, was with construction manager Mielczarek, who took her to a winery in Bowral in the NSW Southern Highlights where a friend performed a song written especially for Frost. \nCameron also tips him as the man most likely to win Frost's heart. \n\"My money is on Sasha at this point, it seems he's always one step ahead. He's a pretty charismatic guy,\" he said. \nNext week Frost will go on three final single dates before choosing the final two men to introduce to her family. alex cameron", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:32:46.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
