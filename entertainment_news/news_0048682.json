The Romanov tsars ruled Imperial Russia for 200 years before Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by Bolshevik revolutionaries in the early 20 th century,. \nHistory buffs and art lovers can see treasures from the Romanov era first-hand when a traveling exhibition featuring more than 200 decorative works opens at the Huntsville Museum of Art on Oct. 11. \n\"The Tsars' Cabinet: Two Hundred Years of Russian Decorative Arts\" is going to be a \"blockbuster\" exhibition, said HMA Executive Director Christopher Madkour. \n\"Bring your family and friends who visit during the holidays,\" he said, \"as this is truly a rare opportunity to see these exquisite and historically important works in our own backyard.\" \nThe exhibit, curated from a private collection, spans the two centuries of Romanov reign, from the time of Peter the Great in the mid-18 th century to the final years of Tsar Nicholas II in the early 20 th century, before his family was ousted and later murdered by Bolshevik revolutionaries. \nDisplays will feature examples of Russian porcelain and glassware produced by the Imperial Porcelain Factory and Imperial Glass Factory, as well as Faberge and Ovchinnikov items.
