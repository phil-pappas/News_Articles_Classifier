If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn't not want to know that.\" \nNicki had previously been engaged in a war of words with Taylor Swift after she was snubbed in the Video of the Year category at the VMAs. \nAt the time Nicki claimed she would have been nominated if she was a \"different kind of artist\" and said: \"Black women influence pop culture so much but are rarely rewarded for it (sic)\". \nThe comments sparked a response from Taylor, who was nominated in the Video of the Year category, and felt Nicki was taking aim at her. \nAnd later, Miley, who fronted the ceremony, slammed the 'Starships' hitmaker for her comments. \nShe said: \"What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj is not too kind. It's not very polite. \n\"I think there's a way you speak to people with openness and love. You don't have to start this pop star against pop star war. It became Nicki Minaj and Taylor in a fight, so now the story isn't even on what you wanted it to be about.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:20:52.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
