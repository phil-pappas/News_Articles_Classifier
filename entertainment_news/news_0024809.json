Why did it take so long for the today's number 1 pop star to make an appearance is anyone's guess, but there's no point in dwelling on it as her time has finally come. And here is the cover in all its glory, courtesy of photographer Michael Thompson. The shoot took place in Malibu, in case you're a stickler for details.\nAccording to UPROXX , Chuck Klosterman will host the interview, and here's why he thinks you should read it next month: \"If you don’t take Swift seriously, you don’t take contemporary music seriously... There’s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It’s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it’s absolutely new.\"\nAs well as an interview with Swift, you can also expect appearances from Jaden Smith, Amber Rose, Aziz Ansari and \"some damn cool robots.\"\nFor those of you reading to find out about her rumoured split with Calvin Harris; they've been dating for a number of months now, so split rumours are inevitable. Also, they've \"not been seen together in 42 days\" - AND they're not instagramming themselves astrid floating swans .\nA source speaking to heatworld.com said: \"They think it'll be good for them to spend less time together. Calvin thinks their relationship was in the spotlight too much. He wants to be more low-key. Taylor's been freaking out about all the people speculating about weddings and babies, and wants things to slow down too.\"\nDespite this, Calvin told KISS FM in July: \"It’s going absolutely fantastic. It’s interesting, because obviously there’s different things written about it every day and even if we don’t do anything publicly for awhile, someone will make something up. …For me, it could be a lot worse, and I’d still be like, insanely happy with her. So, I’m good with it.”\nMORE: Six times Calvin Harris looked like you and me, not an Armani model\nMORE: All the winners from last night's GQ Men of the Year Awards\nMORE: Watch: GQ release glorious full video of Ryan Reynolds failing to assemble Ikea cot.
