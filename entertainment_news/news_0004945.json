Let's leave it at that. He (her son) is training to join films. He hasn't started meeting people. He will do that soon.\"\nBut she did mention that she is looking forward to watching Barjatya and Salman's forthcoming film \"Prem Ratan Dhan Payo\".\n\"The promo is absolutely mind blowing. I am really looking forward to see it,\" she said.\nRecalling her \"Maine Pyar Kiya\" days, she said: \"Salman, Sooraj and I were absolutely new and raw. We all bonded well. For me, the most important part was when we shot the wedding sequence.\"\n\"When they were going to put mehndi on my hand, it was just two days prior to my real wedding. So, the entire shoot was planned in such a way that I could be given a nice send-off. So that is the very lovely memory for me,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:14.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
