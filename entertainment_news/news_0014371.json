Mammooty took on the role of a cameraman and a reporter when he took to his social site to live telecast a short video. Mammootty, who is touring Japan on a two-week trip with family, expressed his delight over the video for all the good reviews that his role of Pallickal Narayanan in the Salim Ahamed-directed Pathemaari has been receiving back home. Then he proceeded to point to a building behind him and mentionied that he was standing in Hiroshima. That the building was bombed in 1945 and still remains as a memory of the tragic incident. He also added that the city still preserved the remains of the atomic bombing that killed lakhs. Mammootty has wrapped up the shoot of A.K. Sajan’s film opposite Nayanthara and will join the sets of his next film soon after he returns to Kerala.
