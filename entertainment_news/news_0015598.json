Reid Fiction & Essay Contest sponsored by Winning Writers. The 2015 contest awarded $4,000 in prizes for the best original short stories, essays, and other short prose, including top prizes of $1,500 apiece for fiction and nonfiction.\nNorthampton, MA (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nWinning Writers is pleased to announce the results from its 23rd annual Tom Howard/John H. Reid Fiction & Essay Contest. Laura Fanning of Alameda, California won first prize in fiction and $1,500 for her story, \"The Brick\" . Madeline Baars of Portland, Oregon won first prize in nonfiction and $1,500 for her essay, \"Trayvon\" . 927 authors from around the world submitted 1,195 entries.\nThe 23rd contest was judged by Arthur Powers, author of A Hero for the People (Press 53, 2013), with preliminary judging by Lauren Singer.\nFanning's poignant yet humorous story of a mother-daughter relationship explores the place of self-care and contemplation in a life of service. An elderly left-wing activist and tireless extrovert undergoes a personality change when a brick hits her in the head at a political demonstration. The narrator feels excluded and confused by her mother's new passion for solitary trips to art museums, until she sees how it fits in to the life lessons that the older woman has learned.\nContest judge Arthur Powers said, \"An amusing story, it has substantial philosophical undertones, with thoughts on art that Thomas Merton would have appreciated.\"\nBaars' fiercely compassionate, heart-rending essay arises from her work at a clinic for low-income families, where racism, violence, dangerous housing, and failing schools conspire to doom many children to short and unhealthy lives. In defiance of fate, numerous mothers there are naming their sons after Trayvon Martin—an unarmed black teenager killed in a highly publicized racial incident in 2012—to signify that black lives matter.\nPowers called this essay \"a hard-hitting, heartfelt piece about life and death in a poverty-ridden New Orleans neighborhood. Baars brings to it the passion of a clinic worker who walks and works with the local people daily.\"\nIn fiction, Honorable Mentions and $100 were given to Roberta George, Robert Goswitz, Anne Hotta, Janet Schneider, and Nina Vaag. In nonfiction, Honorable Mentions and $100 went to George Buelow, Jo-Ann Allan-Forbes, Jocelyn Pihlaja, Jane St. Clair, and Bailey Williams.\n$4,000 was awarded in all.
