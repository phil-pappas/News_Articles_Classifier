You know, emo Eve, the former love of Silent Jay. \nHere she is, showing off her very gothic engagement ring. Filming #gogglebox and trying not to stare at my beautiful ring from my beautiful fiancÃ© & soul mate. #engaged pic.twitter.com/DIwCiqPnsw \nâ€” Eve Woerdenweber (@GoggleboxEve) September 25, 2015 \nHer proud fiancee, Josh Smith, looks pretty chuffed to be a formal future member of the Woerdenweber clan. Apparently he popped the question in Venice, swoon. I was proposed to in Venice and I said yes to my lovely fiancÃ©. I love you sweetheartðŸ’œ @Josh1on1 pic.twitter.com/1Jo9cpJpYt \nâ€” Eve Woerdenweber (@GoggleboxEve) September 23, 2015 \nSome Gogglebox fans were quick to congratulate Josh and Eve on their happy news. Enjoying watching #Gogglebox Congratulations on your engagement Eve! @GoggleboxEve @C4Gogglebox ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰ \nâ€” Leukaemia&Katherine (@Leukaemia_and_K) October 2, 2015 \nBut others didnâ€™t want to let go of Silent Jay so quickly. \nDidnâ€™t she and Silent Jay break up like, five minutes ago?! Eve engaged? Hasn't taken her long to get over Silent Jay #Gogglebox \nWHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?! WE THOUGHT THEIR SILENT EMO ROMANCE WAS REAL. LOVE IS A LIE. How's she engaged already? She was with silent Jay last series #Gogglebox \nRumour mill has gone into overdrive, naturally. Eve must've been cheating on Silent Jay if she's already engaged! #Gogglebox \nâ€” Harry (@harryjms) October 2, 2015 \nSteady on, thatâ€™s a bit much. Before any more completely unfounded speculation is thrown at poor Eve, hereâ€™s a picture of Silent Jay looking happy (well, as happy as a devout emo can muster) on a night out in Liverpool. Heâ€™s totally fine! Chillin' at omnia liverpool with @sam_johnson94 pic.twitter.com/dYvwyQoodD \nâ€” Gogglebox Jay (@ItsJayMAKIN) October 1, 2015 \nMoral of the story? Eve seems happy, Jay seems happy, everybodyâ€™s happy and we can all calm the hell down and look at Eveâ€™s tiny little puppy. Thanks again everyone for watching #Gogglebox . Harley was excited to make her debut! pic.twitter.com/gCyhLovMXV \nâ€” Eve Woerdenweber (@GoggleboxEve) September 18, 2015 \nIn other news, Goggleboxâ€™s Chris Steed has also been doing some left hand flashing on Twitter this week â€“ the Brighton boyâ€™s fella liked it, and thus put a ring on it.
