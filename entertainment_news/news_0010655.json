This means Boobie Dixon will likely get the start, and his backups will be Cierre Wood and newly-signed Boom Herron.\nWilliams suffered a concussion in the Bills' loss to the Giants last week and was in the NFL's concussion protocol all week. Obviously, he has not yet been cleared. McCoy re-injured his hamstring — originally hurt in training camp at St. John Fisher College — in the practice week leading up to the Week 3 game against Miami. He tried to play against the Dolphins, and that may have been a poor decision. McCoy told reporters Friday that he has been told the injury is a three- to four-week process, so he could be out until the Bills return from the bye the first week of November.\n\"I think I made it worse,\" McCoy said of his trying to play too soon.\nAs for wide receiver Sammy Watkins, the receiver took a few reps in practice as he tries to bounce back from a calf injury suffered against Miami, but he will be a game-time decision. He is officially listed as questionable.\nWatkins told reporters, \"I don't know whether I'm going to play or not, but if it's an emergency, if I need to play, I think I'll play.\" Watkins will test things out in the pre-game workout and a decision will be made at that point. If he can't go, Percy Harvin and Robert Woods will continue as the starters.\nRyan said of Watkins, \"I feel really good about how Sammy has progressed. He's excited, so hopefully we'll get him back.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills fullback Jerome Felton thrives on contact\nElsewhere on the injury report, it looks as if rookie right guard John Miller will be able to return to the lineup after missing the Giants game with a groin injury. Safety Aaron Williams is back also, just in time because the man who replaced him the past two weeks, Bacarri Rambo, won't play due to a quad injury.\nRight now, the plan appears to be to carry both kickers on the active roster, meaning Dan Carpenter would handle the placements and newcomer Billy Cundiff will kick off after being signed to replace Jordan Gay. There had been speculation that the Bills would cut Carpenter after signing Cundiff, and then use his roster spot to activate defensive end IK Enemkpali, who has served his complete four-game suspension. Instead, Ryan said Enemkpali will remain on the roster exempt list through Monday.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8084a4dca27264129658ee170356f425011f0165/c=303-0-2841-2538/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635799927004087928-AP-832958846657.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:04:00.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
