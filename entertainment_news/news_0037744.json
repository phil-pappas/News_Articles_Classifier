Related Items Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nJEREMY Renner says \"it's not [his] job\" to help actresses negotiate their salaries, but insists he supports gender equality. \nThe 44-year-old actor, whose American Hustle co-star Jennifer Lawrence recently admitted she was surprised to discover she and Amy Adams were paid less than \"the lucky people with d**ks\" for working on the film, insists he fully supports gender equality in Hollywood, but claims he doesn't even get involved in his own deals. \nAsked if he would be willing to help female co-stars negotiate on future projects, the 'Avengers' star, who has an estimated fortune of $35 million, told Business Insider: \"That's not my job. \n\"I don't know contracts and money and all that sort of stuff. I'm a performer and I know human behaviour. When it comes to that sort of stuff I let other people deal with that. I do what I'm good at, that's what I focus on.\" \nJennifer suggested in the op-ed, Why Do I Make Less Than My Co-Stars, which she penned for Lena Dunham's newsletter Lenny Letter earlier this month, that she had \"failed\" as a negotiator before agreeing to star in the film because she \"gave up early\" in a bid to be liked. \nThe Oscar winner and Jeremy's other co-star Bradley Cooper, 40, previously praised her for speaking out about the gender pay gap in the movie industry and insisted he was more than willing to help resolve the issue. \nHe added: \"Usually you don't talk about the financial stuff, you have people. But you know what? It's time to start doing that.\" gender gap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:31:15.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
