But this week, the church has decided to cut ties with the troop. Troop leader Jeff Wyman tells us it's because Boy Scouts of America is now allowing gay leaders, and that Westminster Presbyterian hinted at this back when Boy Scouts of America decided to allow gay scouts. \n\"They continued the relationship with them with the thing that if they changed the policy any further, we are gonna re-visit this and decide if we renew the charter or not,\" said Wyman. \"The policy is written in such a way that the BSA, the people who are paid by the BSA, can't discriminate based on sexual orientation, but the charter organization still has some leverage in who they allow to be leaders and who they don't allow to be leaders. They're the ones that sign off on the application for any leader.\" \nWCCB Charlotte reached out to Westminster Presbyterian. Senior Pastor Mike Honeycutt said only that they'll notify congregants of their decision tomorrow. \nWCCB Charlotte obtained a copy of the email another troop leader sent to Boy Scouts and their families. It reads, in part: \"Because this was expected, we have been planning for a while and have looked at several churches to move to.\" \nSo our question of the night: What would Jesus do?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:18:21.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
