Photo: Supplied \nSydney's music festival season is getting a new addition this summer with the return of Vibes on a Summer's Day.\nThe indoor-outdoor festival will be held in Bondi in January and revives the event that brought Jamiroquai to Barangaroo in 2002, but ceased operations the following year amid concerns it had lost some of its boutique charm on relocating to the city.\nFestival promoter Joe Conneely, who founded Vibes on a Summer's Day in 1994 at Bondi Pavilion, said he was looking to re-establish the festival at its original beachside location. He was happy to learn that Waverley Council, which manages the heritage-listed building, had positive recollections of the festival being staged there in the latter half of the 1990s, he said.\nJamiroquai performing at Vibes on a Summer's Day in 2002.

We're going back to around 1200 capacity at Bondi. Numbers will also be limited due to renovations currently underway [at Bondi Pavilion].\"\nVibes on a Summer's Day organiser Joe Conneely. Photo: Narelle Autio \nConneely said the January 25 festival line-up would not be revealed until after the first release of tickets went on sale on October 15 at $90. He wanted to ensure those who supported the festival's early incarnation had first dibs.\nIn its heyday, Vibes on a Summer's Day catered for eclectic dance and electronic tastes fuelled by a wave of interest in British soul-funk inspired acts and DJs associated with rare-groove record collecting, and a genre known as acid-jazz. It launched in 1994 with the English DJ pairing of Norman Jay and the BBC's Gilles Peterson, and local acts included the yet to break commercially Directions in Groove.\nThe festival expanded to tour other capital cities and introduced Australians to international artists including Bentley Rhythm Ace, Rae & Christian, Groove Armada and the Propellerheads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:59:49.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
