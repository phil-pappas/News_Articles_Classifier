Reprising the country music legend will be Mary Pfeifer of Gardner, Ill., who prefers to be called a tribute artist since \"no one can replace Patsy Cline.\" In her \"Simply Patsy\" performance, Pfeifer takes the audience through some of her best-known recordings from 1955 to 1963, with added details of Cline's life as she began building her singing career. Pfeifer first hit the stage at Starved Rock Lodge as a contestant in the Rock Star competition in 2007, and first performed Patsy Cline songs in 2009 when she starred in the play, “Always Patsy Cline,” at Engle Lane Theater in Streator. She’s been paying tribute to the star ever since. The tables and chairs will be removed and Saturday night's event will be held \"amid the stacks\" on the main floor of the library, built in the early 1900s with the help of a donation from industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The library has been restored to its early, elegant appearance while incorporating 21st-Century technology and information services. Access to the first floor is available by elevator from the First Street (north side) entrance. A social hour will begin at 6 p.m. followed by dinner presented by PL Damron's Catering at 6:30 and the performane at 7:30. Tickets are $35 per person and on sale at Kewanee Public Library, 102 S. Tremont St. For more information, call 852-4505. The program's benefactor is the State Bank of Toulon. Patrons include Heartfelt Gifts, Union Federal Savings & Loan, Calvert Tax & Bookkeeping, First Financial Investment Advisors. Transamerica Financial Advisors, and David and Sara Boswell. Advocates include 1st Financial Partners, Mike Nichols State Farm Agency, Ed's Heating, Air Conditioning, Plumbing and Electric, First Federal Savings and Loan, Compton Accounting, and Edward Six State Farm.
