(Screengrab: Movieclips Trailers/YouTube) Related Links \nLos Angeles - Colin Farrell was attracted to the \"awkwardness\" of The Lobster . \nThe 39-year-old actor stars opposite Rachel Weisz in the Yorgos Lanthimos-directed sci-fi comedy, in which finding love is a matter of life of death, and has revealed that the unique nature of the script convinced him to accept the role. \nHe shared: \"It was just so unusual, man. There's such an awkwardness to it, and such a lack of convention to it. And it's a very extreme world and very total world. \"It's both allegorical to things that have happened and exist in the world around us, and recognisable in its lack of conventionality. \n\"But essentially, I just found it funny and moving.\" \nWhat's more, the Irish actor admitted the movie is the strangest he's ever been involved with. \nAsked if he can imagine making a more unusual film, he told NME: \"I don't think so, no.\" \nColin also revealed some of his own pals have watched the movie more than once in order to understand it. \nHe said: \"Some of my friends went to see it a second time. Not because they loved it but because they were scratching their heads.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:59:23.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
