Justin was photographed while on holiday in Bora Bora, French Polynesia, with his model girlfriend Jayde Pierce. \nThe pictures, which were published in the New York Daily News on October 7, showed him naked while walking around outside his beachside villa. Lawyers for the singer recently demanded the pictures be removed from the newspaper's website, and they have threatened other publications with legal action if editors publish the images. \nThe superstar revealed in an interview with U.S. TV show Access Hollywood that he wasn't happy about the privacy intrusion and felt uncomfortable with the world seeing his manhood. \n\"My first thing was like...how can they do this? Like, I feel super violated,\" he told interviewer Billy Bush. \n\"Like, I feel like I can't step outside and feel like I can go outside naked. Like, you should feel comfortable in your own space... especially that far away.\" \nHowever, Justin joked that despite what the world saw in the infamous pictures, there is more to his physique than meets the eye. \n\"That was shrinkage for me,\" the Baby hitmaker laughed. Justin also left Billy stunned when he jokingly offered to show him his penis after the presenter confessed he hadn't seen the pop star's manhood in the shots. When the newsman became flustered and confessed he hadn't seen the uncensored images, the smiling star got up from his chair, stood in front of the host and pretended to take his belt off. \nTeasing next week's interview on Friday's Access Hollywood Live, Billy said, \"He got offended that I had not seen his nude photo... so he decided to give me an up-close-and personal!\" \nJustin also discussed his first ever number one in the U.S. with his recent hit \"What Do You Mean?,\" which he said was \"pretty awesome\". \n\"I've been around for so long that people thought that maybe I had a number one already and I've had number ones, like number one on iTunes and stuff, but to have a Billboard number one is really special because it's like everything added up together,\" the singer said. \n\"I debuted at number one and I think I'm the youngest person to debut at number one, which is pretty awesome.\" The interview is due to air on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:48:17.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
