Cahill was 0-3 with a 7.52 ERA in 15 appearances and was at the end of a four-year, $30 million deal.\n\"I knew coming to a winning team as a minor-leaguer I'd have to do really well and throw some shutout innings,\" Cahill said. \"I didn't know what my role would be coming up here.\"\nCahill eventually made it up from Triple-A Iowa, pitched well out of the bullpen and made a big contribution Saturday in the Cubs' 6-3 victory over the Cardinals in Game 2 of the NL Division Series. He pitched a perfect eighth inning, including strikeouts of Matt Carpenter and Stephen Piscotty.\nCahill, Austin Jackson, Fernando Rodney and Clayton Richard may have been cast-offs from their last teams, but the Cubs' major-league scouts all saw something that was salvageable, and now they're instrumental parts of a winning team.\nCubs president Theo Epstein gets most of the credit, but he knows the amateur and pro scouts and development people all helped create the team that's shocked the baseball world. He's invited all the full-time baseball operations staff to attend Game 3.\n\"They'll all be there with their wives, which will be a really cool moment because they were all a part of it,\" he said.\nAs much as the Cubs rely on analytics, Epstein insisted they're \"not just numbers crunchers.\" When he came to the Cubs in 2011, one of the storylines was whether he'd bring along \"Carmine,\" the name of the database he used in Boston.\nEpstein admitted the \"computer geek\" stereotype of the Cubs' front office gets \"under my skin\" at times.\n\"I don't think it's fair,\" he said. \"Like Carmine, we have one here called 'Ivy.' But that's half the equation. Internally, I think if we're good at anything it's understanding the game is played by human beings, and to get ahead these days you have to take a humanistic approach to player development. And we do.\n\"I feel like that's one of the reasons we've had a lot of success in player development, we don't just look at players as a stat line. We look at them as human beings and try to support them during adversity and keep them grounded during the success.\"\npsullivan@tribune.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Theo Epstein Trevor Cahill Clayton Richard Matt Carpenter Austin Jackson", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561af7ce/turbine/ct-theo-epstein-moves-cubs-cardinals-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:36:05.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
