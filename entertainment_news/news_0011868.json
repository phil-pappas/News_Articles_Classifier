For older businesses, reinvention is harder but no less necessary. \nAs Bob Dylan wrote, \"He who's not busy being born is busy dying.\" Crain's New York Business turned 30 years old this year, giving us a reason to reflect on how we approach our mission, which is to be an indispensable source of news and insight for New York professionals, owners, managers and investors. Our weekly print newspaper used to be where New Yorkers got their local business news. Now they go to CrainsNewYork.com or sign up for the half-dozen email newsletters that we send daily to business decision makers. We believe that what readers really need from a print experience is refuge from today's perpetual onslaught of digital information—an oasis of smart storytelling and insightful analysis that allows busy, thoughtful people to better understand their industries and their city. \nThat's why we have radically redesigned our flagship print product, transitioning from a newspaper to a newsmagazine. In tandem with our digital offerings, this change will allow us to serve our audiences with digital immediacy and print foresight. To make the reading experience better, we've organized ourselves into three parts: An opening Agenda section mixes timely news with interesting revelation, leading with our editorial and concluding with our signature lists. Then, an expanded feature section offers deeply reported stories and packages that tell the city's best stories. In the back of the new Crain's , you'll see familiar and popular elements reimagined, like Gotham Gigs and Executive Moves. A new back-page feature, Photo Finish, offers a parting shot that tells you something important about what makes New York a unique place to do business. \nOur timing for all this reinvention couldn't be better. After years of decline, the printed word is making a comeback, not just here at Crain's but across the media world, where book publishers are firing up the presses and e-reader sales are slowing for the first time. Like readers, advertisers want a restful place far from the cacophony of the information superhighway. The reinvented Crain's is an off-ramp, a destination and a road map for the next 30 years.
