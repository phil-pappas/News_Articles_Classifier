You always have to scrutinise and ask hard questions of those scenes – how necessary are they? (Joel Ryan/Invision) \n“But the consummation of their (Carol and Therese’s) relationship is really important. It’s just about how we were going to do it. We talked about the scene and there’s a great sense of trust between Rooney and I.” \nEarlier the actress – who dazzled in a navy and white gown by Colombian-born designer Esteban Cortazar – said it was a “relief” to carry out the love scenes with her 30-year-old co-star. Promoted stories \n“Both characters are quite isolated – not only because their feelings set them apart from others, but the gap in their ages. They go through these volcanic feelings towards one another so it was a relief to do the scenes with Rooney. Finally we get to be together.” \nRooney, who wore a nude ruffled dress by Alexander McQueen, credited her co-star for making her feel at ease. \nShe said: “I felt as comfortable with them as any other love scene. \n“Getting to work opposite Cate was a dream. She’s a very generous actor and super prepared but also she’s very alive and in the moment. I don’t know if many people know this but she’s also really funny – this incredible Australian sense of humour and wit about her.” (Joel Ryan/Invision) \nThe director, who previously worked with Cate on the Bob Dylan film I’m Not There, wanted his stars to feel comfortable with the scenes. \nTodd said: “Love scenes are always hard. They are always scary. We do our best to all talk about it together, me and the actors, to know exactly what they’re calling for narratively to how we’re going to shoot it so they feel as comfortable and prepared as possible. \n“This is an essential component of the story and in that regard, there was no doubting it or feeling like it’s exploitative in any way.” \nCate, who has won two Academy Awards for her performances in Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator and Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine, said she is “excited” to be this year’s recipient of the BFI Fellowship. She will receive the accolade at the London Film Festival Awards on October 17. (Ian West/PA) \n“I hope they’re not going to change their mind. It’s great. It’s absolutely marvellous,” she said. “The pedigree and the list of people who come before me is rather daunting but I’m really excited.” \nThe actress joins previous winners of the BFI Fellowship such as Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Al Pacino and the late Christopher Lee. \nRooney said Cate is a worthy winner of the prize: “I can’t think of anyone more deserving. She is one of the greatest actresses that we have today.” Share article \nCarol, adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s novel The Price Of Salt, opens in UK cinemas on November 27.
