The shooting of this film, to be directed by debutant Prashanth Pandiyaraj, begins mid-November. Interestingly, Kriti is currently working in a Telugu film with Ram Charan, which has also been titled Bruce Lee. Confirming the news, Prashanth says, \"We feel that Kriti will be apt for the role the script demands. She will be playing a bold college girl and her name in the film is Saroja Devi. We will be shooting in the city from November.\" Is it a film about martial arts, given the name? Says Prashanth, \"GV's name in the film is Bruce Lee and hence the title. This will be again an entertaining film like his earlier ones.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-26T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:56:39.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
