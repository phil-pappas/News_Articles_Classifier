Holman , Springfield News-Leader 3:42 p.m. CDT October 1, 2015 Springfield rockers TROY (The Reality of Yourself) won a national battle of the bands and will drop their new album Friday at an Outland Ballroom show. Sunday, they’re off to LA to record with legendary producer Jay Baumgardner. Bandmates include drummer Erik Milan, vocalist Cord Bishop, guitarist Kyle Girth and bass player Kane Ransom.

Now they’re dropping an album Friday , and on the other side of the weekend they’re headed to Hollywood to take a shot at the big time with a “wizard”-level music producer, Jay Baumgardner. \nMeanwhile, the founding bandmates are earnest nice guys, Millennials who’ve been friends since they were 5th-graders in Pleasant Hope. \nCord Bishop and Kane Ransom said they developed their love of rock by kicking each under under their desks at school as they debated the weighty question of “Who’s better? Tool or Metallica?” \nTheir families were fans, and players, of rock and bluegrass. By the time they were in high school, Bishop and Ransom played their own music. \nEarly rehearsals happened Monday and Tuesday nights in The Lair, their nickname for a creepy 19th-century house belonging to a former bandmate’s grandparents. (Creepy because the place was legendary in local lore for accidental deaths — and maybe some on-purpose ones — that happened on premises.) \nIf it sounds like a teenage dude’s weird dream, it just might be. But the next step was 11 years of work, Bishop and Ransom said. \nSince 2004, they’ve been working hard at building TROY, which now includes guitarist Kyle Girth and drummer Erik Milan. \nThe name is an acronym for The Reality Of Yourself, a nod to band members’ belief that a person’s conscious attitude or mentality determines his or her reality. \nThe reality for TROY right now is a pace that’s picking up, day by day. They’re taking their shot at the big time beginning this weekend. \n“It’s fun to be this busy,” said Bishop, vocalist and guitar-player. He and Ransom, who plays bass, took a break from 16-hour days songwriting, recording and rehearsing to tell the News-Leader what they’re up to. \nIt’s a high-energy list: \n• TROY’s new album, “Two Worlds,” comes out Friday. It’s their third EP, and they’re celebrating with a show at the Outland Ballroom, doors opening at 7 p.m. Also onstage: Fraught with Peril and The Verbing Nouns, two Springfield bands, and Columbia’s Decadent Nation and Dark Below. “This new album has a more open, broader musical face,” Ransom said. “No matter who you are, you’ll get something out of it.” With that, Bishop chimed in to say “It’s something you can take to your grandma,” which the guys literally have done. Ransom’s told him she liked the beat. \n• In the run-up to “Two Worlds,” the band’s song “The Reckoning” has been playing daily on Q102.1. TROY’s also had sold-out shows at local venues like Cartoons and the Outland, to the point where they didn’t have room for Ransom’s dad to attend a recent gig due to fire code regulations. “That was not awesome,” Ransom said, making a mock sadface while sporting cool-guy shades. \n• This spring, TROY won a national battle of the bands put on by Rockstar energy drinks and Ernie Ball, the guitar string company. How’d they do it? By making fans happy. The TROY guys talk about their fans in a way that makes them almost seem like family, not just among Springfield’s heavy-metal crowd but in terms of the cross-pollination with the reggae and bluegrass scenes. It took fans’ likes, shares and views to get them into regional semifinals in the form of a showcase concert in Bonner Springs, Kan. “We just had to perform and kill it,” Ransom said. And they did: A jury of industry pros crowned them kings. “We waited and waited,” Bishop said, “and then we got an email from them that said ‘would you like to take a phone call?’” Yes, please: “I’d like to take a phone call!” \n• TROY’s win comes with a prize. Sunday night — two days after releasing their new album — they’re off to Los Angeles to record yet more new music with producer Jay Baumgardner at NRG Studios in North Hollywood, Calif. This is a big deal for Bishop, Ransom and their bandmates because Baumgardner inspires borderline reverence in guys like them. “Jay is rock royalty,” Bishop said. “He’s worked with every band that shaped my childhood. I grew up spinning those CDs until they didn’t play.” Artists include Godsmack, Seether (both of which TROY has served in an opening-act capacity), Evanescence, Bush and a long list of others. \n“I think the goal is to get out there and write music and let him hone us,” Bishop added. “He’s a wizard.” \n“And we get to be the sorcerer’s apprentice,” Ransom said. “Boil, boil, toil and rock!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:14:26.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
