More to the point, is it possible Jobs (Irishman Michael Fassbender) really talked as much as the character in this film, scripted by the notably logorrhea-prone Aaron Sorkin, based on a book by Walter Isaacson?\nDespite being directed by the Academy Award-winning filmmaker of “Slumdog Millionaire” and the visually stunning “Trainspotting,” this film is entirely hijacked by Sorkin’s screenplay, which must have been hundreds of pages long. Combine this with the banality of the often hand-held visuals (the 1984 scenes were shot in grainy 16mm, a bad choice), and you have a film that is not really a film, but some sort of auditory experience with images or radio with lights.\nThe action, much of which takes place backstage, often recalling Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu’s recent dazzling masterpiece “Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),” begins at the 1984 launch of the Mac­intosh, where we meet a young Steve; his loyal cohort Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), who stage manages the event; Jobs’ unstable former lover Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston); and their precocious 5-year-old daughter, Lisa (Makenzie Moss), whom Jobs will not acknowledge and whom he torments horribly in one scene. The rest of the film takes place backstage at the 1988 launch of NeXT and the 1998 launch of the iMac.\nThe script presents confrontations between Jobs and Chrisann and Lisa, or Jobs and Wozniak, or Jobs and John Sculley (Sorkin interpreter Jeff Daniels), like batters stepping up to the plate to swing for the bleachers. Many of these shouting matches come across as canned, contrived and mechanical. Sculley, Jobs’ surrogate father and the man who famously fired him from Apple, brings up Jobs’ adoption as an infant and offers psychological observations about it in a scene featuring stacks of spiky, interwoven, bentwood chairs, one of the film’s few visual flourishes.\nThe general impression is that Jobs is an abrasive, unreasonable egomaniac and control freak. Really? That’s it? Steve “Woz” Wozniak (Seth Rogen) provides the film with a “geek chorus,” showing up at each launch to lob bombshells, mostly accusing Jobs justifiably of hogging the spotlight and taking all the credit, while Woz is relegated to the shadows.\nWe get the famous “bicycle for the mind” speech in which Jobs explains how a computer gives the user a new freedom. The film is well-acted, for sure, but “Steve Jobs” buries its subject beneath a torrent of verbiage, a paradox given how visual computers and the cinema are.\nI wish I could say that Fassbender is riveting in the title role. But I found myself wanting to shout, “Shut up for a minute, please,” at him and every­one else. Waterston stands around, glaring and demanding money. Boyle should have cut half the dialogue.\nAlex Gibney’s documentary “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine” is far more insightful than this droning soap opera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:56:41.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
