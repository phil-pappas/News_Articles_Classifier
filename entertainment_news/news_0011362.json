The proposal is meant to make it harder for criminals to steal guns from legal owners and use them to commit violence. As many as 60 percent of guns used in crimes in Rochester this year were at some point legally owned, County Legislator Ernest Flagler-Mitchell said at a Thursday news conference.\nFlagler-Mitchell's cousin, Herbert Thomas, was one of two men killed in a Sept. 12 shooting at a house party on Woodward Street on the city's northeast side.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nVictim's mother begs for violence to end\n\"We support people having the right to bear arms,\" Flagler-Mitchell said. \"We just want you to be responsible with bearing your arms.\"\nThe proposal could go before the County Legislature either this month or the next.\nViolations of the proposed county law would carry a $1,000 fine or 15 days in jail for a first offense, and a $5,000 fine and/or a year in jail thereafter, but it was not immediately clear how the law might be enforced. A similar requirement has been on the books in the city for years.\nCarrie Andrews, Democratic minority leader for the County Legislature, downplayed the enforcement piece. She said the vast majority of gun owners follow the law and that passing the legislation would help raise awareness of safe storage.\n\"We do think that passing a law like this will generate public conversation, awareness and has the potential certainly to decrease the number of guns that are stolen, again, from legal, law-abiding gun owners,\" Andrews said.\nAndrews said the proposal is not meant to be a cure-all, but a small step in the right direction.\nThe law would require gun shops to post signs explaining the rules and saying that gun owners may face additional penalties if an improperly stored firearm is used by someone else in a crime.\nThis summer, there were at least two major thefts of safes containing guns from city homes — one on Lake Avenue in July and another on Clay Avenue in early September.\nAn AK-47 used in a drive-by shooting outside the Boys and Girls Club on Genesee Street was likely among the guns stolen from Lake Avenue .\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nKiller AK-47 traced to burglary\nDemocrats hold the minority in the legislature, and their proposals usually gain little traction with the Republican majority. It remains to be seen whether Flagler-Mitchell's proposal will be a rare exception — particularly in a county where public opinion is at best divided over the state's SAFE Act gun control law .\nThe Republican Majority Office has not yet responded to a request for comment.\nAll but two Democrats in the legislature have signed onto the proposal. Lawmakers Dorothy Styk and John Lightfoot have not signaled their support.\nAfter last month's shooting, Flagler-Mitchell said he would try to address gun violence and mental health issues through his county position.\nWilliam B. James, 30, was charged last month with second-degree murder in the death of John Rudolph, 36, the other man who was killed at the party. No one has been charged in Thomas' killing.\nFlagler-Mitchell said there are similar requirements in Massachusetts, New York City and Albany. Gun control advocates have pushed for a similar firearm storage law at the state level.\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nErnest Flagler-Mitchell talks about his cousin who was killed in the shooting on Woodward Street on Sept. 12, 2015.
