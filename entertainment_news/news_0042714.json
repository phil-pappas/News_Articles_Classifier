Like Us on Facebook \nMace was sitting under a Bunya pine tree, which is not native to that region as noted by the lawsuit, when the 16-pound conifer landed on his head causing him to be rushed to the hospital. A Bunya 's \"seedpods, or pine cones, of a Bunya pine can grow to be 16 inches in diameter and weigh up to 40 pounds,\" explains the Chronicle . The navy vet underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain at the San Francisco General Hospital. He then had a second surgery, five days later, to relieve the pressure building around his skull. According to Scott Johnson, a San Francisco attorney, Mace will also need a third surgery. \nMace's lawyer is suing the U.S . government, the National Park Service, the Department of the Interior and San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park for the \"traumatic brain injury, with severe and likely irreversible cognitive deficits\" he received since the park did not post warning signs to prevent people from lounging under the trees. \nThe pinecone incident has not only affected Mace's health, but his social life as well. As a result \" he's afraid to go outside at this point because he's afraid something is going to hit him in the head. Our priority is to institute change and help this guy out. He was doing pretty well before the accident, and now he is completely dependent and will likely need lifetime care,\" reports his lawyer. \nAccording to the Chronicle the park has since made some changes to prevent another case like this. Orange fences with warning signs stating \"danger: giant seed pod falling from tree\" have been placed around the pine trees. \nMace is reportedly hoping this lawsuit will lead to policy changes so no other person has to experience what he has had to go through.
