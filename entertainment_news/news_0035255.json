Actor Patrick Dempsey in Maine for cancer fundraiser Associated Press | \nLEWISTON, Maine (AP) — Actor Patrick Dempsey traded his race car for a bicycle this weekend at the Dempsey Challenge in his home state. \nDempsey returned to Maine for the two-day fundraiser involving biking, running and walking events that started after his racing team's victory at the \"Six Hours of Fuji\" endurance race in Japan. \nThe event in Maine, where Dempsey was born, is a fundraiser for The Patrick Dempsey Center for Cancer Hope & Healing, which he and his sisters created in 2008 in partnership with the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. They were inspired by their mother, Amanda who died from cancer last year. \nDempsey told the Sun Journal that coming home for the Dempsey Challenge is like coming home for a family reunion, sharing memories, grief, accomplishments and support. \n\"The overall feeling and openness of everyone participating in the challenge is magical,\" he said. \nHe was joined at the event's annual Cancer Survivors' Walk on Saturday by Joan Lunden, a journalist and television host who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014. She told the crowd of walkers and runners that the \"unsung heroes\" are the nurses and volunteers who help cancer patients in their journey. \nOn Sunday, Dempsey will be participating in a 50-mile ride. \nDempsey is best known as Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd on TV's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" but he left the show earlier this year and put his focus on his racing team, Dempsey Proton Racing. In addition to racing, he's filming the movie \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" in London. \nAbout 4,000 people were participating in the challenge. The goal is to break the 2014 record of $1.41 million raised by 3,871 participants, said Aimee Arsenault Labbe, the Dempsey Center's manager of special events and development. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:38:06.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
