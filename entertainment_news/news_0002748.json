Odom was hospitalized Tuesday after he was found unconscious at the Love Ranch, where he had been holed up since Saturday. After being unresponsive for days, Odom said \"hi\" to his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, a source with knowledge of the situation said Friday. It was unclear whether he remained conscious or how long he was awake. Odom's college coach, Jim Harrick, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Kardashian told him she reached down to Odom on Friday and told him she loved him. Odom blinked, he said. Read More \"He's awake now,\" Harrick said. \"So that's probably the most encouraging news we've had since it all started.\" Odom is using a mask to breathe and has serious damage to his vital organs, his former mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, told \"Access Hollywood.\" 'Tiny bit' of improvement A source close to the situation told CNN on Friday the 35-year-old improved a \"tiny bit\" during his third night at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center. Odom \"got a tiny bit better -- emphasis on tiny -- and he was responsive in the middle of the night for a moment,\" the source said. Little is known about what left him unresponsive at the brothel in Crystal, where he was found Tuesday, three days after he checked in. Most of the information has come from Dennis Hof, owner of the Love Ranch, where the former basketball player was found. Drugs and money In three days at the brothel, Odom spent $75,000, which guaranteed two women would \"take care of any of his needs,\" Hof told CNN's sister network HLN. He used cocaine on his first day at the brothel Saturday, employees told 911 dispatchers. A woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days. The brothel's employees said when they found him, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. 14 photos: Former NBA star Lamar Odom Lamar Odom dribbles the ball during an NBA game against the Denver Nuggets in November 2010.
