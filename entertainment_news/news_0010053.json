Comment Andre.lamar@doverpost.com@302DoAndre Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 4:00 am Updated at 8:42 AM The 26th annual Sea Witch Festival will conjure up spooky entertainment for a cluster of revelers who will invade Rehoboth and Dewey beaches next weekend. The festival, by Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce, will be held Oct. 23-25 at multiple locations across both beaches. Typically, some 185,000 people are attracted to the festival across the three days. Many of the major events are in Rehoboth. With more than 100 activities to explore and lots of ground to cover, here’s a guide to some nifty events you’ll want to check out. 1. MAKE YOUR OWN SCARECROW (Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) It’s not quite cold enough for us to build snowmen. However, it’s a different story when it comes to making a scarecrow. Youngsters and their parents can Make Your Own Scarecrow at the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand on Saturday and Sunday. The program is staffed by Mariner Middle School’s AVID program and allows participants to cut loose and dress their scarecrows in colorful fashion, said Cannon Cheryl, an AVID Mariner teacher. “People like to talk about where they’re going to place the scarecrow in their yard, and they always laugh at how it looks in the end,” she said. 2. COSTUME PARADE (Saturday, 11 a.m.) The annual costume parade is a staple of the festival and offers some of the wittiest cosplay you’ll see in the First State. The parade, on Saturday in Rehoboth, averages 950 costumed walkers and is so large it’s limited to 50 floats. One year a family turned heads with their collaborative costume. “I had an entire family of about 15 that came as the Bay Bridge,” said Carol Everhart, president and chief executive officer of the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce. “It took up a whole block and each person was a different piece of the bridge,” Everhart added. “That was very memorable.” Registration for costumed walkers is at 10 a.m. at Convention Hall. The parade starts at 11 a.m. and will head west on Rehoboth Avenue toward the bandstand. The parade will finish at Village by the Sea. Costumed award winners and vehicles will be announced after at the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand. 3. MONSTER ART (Saturday and Sunday, 12-5 p.m.) Lots of kids create Halloween-themed art. But how many of them can say they’ve sent their spooky creations to members of the armed forces in celebration of this ghoulish holiday? Kids will have this opportunity during the Monster Art activity at the pavilions in Grove Park in Rehoboth on Saturday and Sunday. The activity has been well received over the last couple of years, by both troops and young artists. “Every once in a while, a service person will take the time to send an email thanking the Chamber and expressing how much they enjoyed the artwork,” Everhart said. “That’s definitely a warm, fuzzy feeling.” 4. SEA WITCH HUNT (1 p.m., Saturday) There’s nothing like a scavenger hunt in search of an invisible witch to inspire kids and adults alike to put their detective skills to the test. The Sea Witch Hunt is held Saturday and begins at the Rehoboth Bandstand. The search has been a favorite for years because it generates lots of suspense. “You don’t know where she’s hiding. She’s invisible,” Everhart said. “Even if you’re right, you’re not sure because you can’t see her. So you have to wait [until the hunt is over] to find out,” Everhart added. For this scavenger hunt, participants must first check in with the official clue keeper to receive a list of 100-plus clue locations where the invisible witch might be hiding; and the list isn’t in chronological order. Hunters visit the locations and each has a clue that points to the witch’s whereabouts. Hunters must submit their answers by 5 p.m. and whoever is the first to reveal where the witch is hiding will receive a cash prize. 5. FIDDLER’S FESTIVAL (Saturday, 1 to 6 p.m.) It’s tradition that Delaware’s Fiddler’s Festival is held at the Sea Witch Festival. The foot-stompin’ competition kicks off at the Rehoboth Beach Convention Hall on Saturday. During the Fiddler’s Festival, the best musicians earn a cash prize. There are adult and children’s competitions for best fiddle, mandolin, banjo and bluegrass band. 6. SPOOKY RADIO SHOW (Saturday, 7 p.m.) During the 1930s and 1940s, folks would listen to spooky tales from the radio. Georgetown’s Ad Hoc Touring Company will bring back this nostalgia with a reenactment of the famous, farcical black comedy “Arsenic and Old Lace” at the Rehoboth Beach Museum, Saturday. Ad Hoc director Ron Pakula said listening to radio shows are fun because “you get to use your imagination.” “Arsenic and Old Lace,” a play that was later adapted into a film, follows two elderly aunts who euthanize old men by slipping arsenic into their drinks.
