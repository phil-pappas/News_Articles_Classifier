About his negative character in the movie, the Nee-na actor says that he \"plays a goon-turned-underworld don who is stuck in the 80s while the world has moved on.\"\n\"It's 1989 again for my character,\" he gushes. \"I play the villain who is a die-hard fan of Rambo and so dresses up like him and has all the mannerisms of Rambo. My outfits include sweatpants, boxing gloves, headbands, and heavy artillery. I even sport his hairstyle.\"\nWhile his name and get up seem funny, Vijay Babu says, \"I am a very serious person in the movie. People refer to me as Rambo and I enjoy it.\" Mudhugavu stars Suresh Gopi's son, Gokul Suresh, and Arthana in the lead. The plot thickens when Rambo gets involved in the couple's life.
