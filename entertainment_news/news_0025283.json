Branch features Bellangelo wines aplenty, but it also offers New York beers, ciders and spirits, co-owner Christopher Missick said. \nThe Missick family owns Bellangelo and Branch. \nBellangelo is licensed as a farm winery, which means it can offer tastings and sales of other New York products, along with its own. It's also required to use New York grapes in its wines. \nFor now, Branch offers tastings of Bellangelo wines and a rotating selection of reds from other wineries. The goal is to build up to tastings of even more New York items, Missick said. \nCustomers can purchase the shop's wines and other beverages by the glass or bottle and drink them at the store. \n\"The goal is to introduce people to the Finger Lakes,\" Missick said. \nMissick said he looked at other potential locations for Branch, but Destiny made sense because of the foot traffic. \nIt draws visitors from the Syracuse area, but also from across Upstate New York and even other countries, he added. \nBranch has other New York goods for sale as well, including soaps, teas and cheeses. The shop is open regular mall hours. \nThe store is located on the first level of Destiny's expansion section, across from Cheesecake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:26:02.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
