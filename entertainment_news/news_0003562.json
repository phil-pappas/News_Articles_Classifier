Man, was this episode rough for him — and he wasn't even the one being tortured! Here are the highlights:\nMama Salvatore doesn't play nice. Have you ever had a friend tell you a story where afterward you instantly think, Oh, this is why you are the way you are ? Well, that was Lily's vase story to Damon. It was even more revealing than all the Katherine stuff. So, great job, writers. Lily wants to teach Damon a lesson for killing Malcolm, so she steals Elena's coffin and says he always did like to throw a tantrum (that cold, accurate bitch). Lily explains that young Damon would not confess to breaking her grandmother's vase, even after his father beat him, so she took away all his toys and, finally, that made him confess.\n Later in the episode, though, Damon reveals the real key to the lovely family anecdote: When Lily took away his toys, she also took away Stefan's. Stefan would cry and Damon would do anything to make him stop. Damon makes it sound like he confessed because Stefan annoyed him and his mom pitted them against each other. But it was probably also because he didn't want Stefan to be punished for his mistakes.\nMore From Cosmopolitan The good news (kinda) is that now the Salvatore bros have a plan to beat Lily. They'll act like they are fighting, while Damon goes to find the one heretic that is on an errand (Oscar, I think).\nBrief tangent: Can we please not talk about moving around/dumping Elena's body, show? It's too much for me. I can't take it. She deserves to nap in peace.\nSpeaking of Mama Salvatore, she is clearly horny as hell. I'm all for Damon getting a lesson in not being so damn glib all the time, but not from Lily and the heretics. Sure, they loved Malcolm and have sentimental stories about him. But they straight-up massacred a bunch of innocent people not that long ago. No one really has the moral high ground here.\nRegardless of how much you hate Lily by the end of this episode (or love, I don't know your life), how great was it when Enzo touched her hair and she got the horniest we've ever seen her? Enzo is hot and it has obviously been a while, but try to play it a little smoother, girl.\nBonnie is still doing it for herself. I was sort of bummed at how separate from the group Bonnie was this week. Well, she was with Matt. Oh, poor Matt. There was a lot of referring to characters as \"toys\" this week, but no one is more of a toy for monsters to play with than Matt. He's just trying to protect two idiots from getting killed at the beginning of the episode and what does he get for it? His blood drained, the deed to a house inhabited by a bunch of sadists, and his memory of it all compelled away. Then Bonnie stops his heart for six minutes, which is the max amount of time a heart can stop before you can't be resuscitated, to give Damon and Stefan time to rescue Caroline, which they … of course do not accomplish in time.\nAlso in this episode, Bonnie correctly tells Alaric that the Phoenix Stone is no good (she gets some pretty gnarly visions when she touches it) and he … of course does not listen to her and does not destroy it. Maybe she's the one tormenting them in the future, just screaming, \"Help me help you!\"\nMary Louise and Nora are your new fave ride-or-die couple. My dearest Caroline was trapped this whole episode and remained trapped at the end (we'll get to the flash-forward).\nMary Louise told a story about her family owning a slaughterhouse back in the day that was chilling, to say the least. Then she asks Caroline to consult on her girlfriend's funeral style. Caroline, drugged up on vervain and hanging from the ceiling — Girl, put a pin in this for now, but when you get free can you tell me where those shoes were from? — laughs at Nora's old-fashioned dress. It's totally the wrong move and Mary Louise goes full-on evil witch-vampire and starts stabbing Caroline with eyeliner.\nCaroline's mocking does make Nora change into a more modern outfit and there's a weirdly sweet moment where Caroline gives the new dress (one of Elena's left in the Salvatore mansion) her seal of approval. The whole thing makes you wish they could just get through their differences and become a sisterhood of boss bitches, ruling the world.\nValerie is the mean one, and she's also obsessed with Stefan. Instead of them all banding together to be immortals that solve world hunger, they scheme. Valerie acts all nice to Caroline, taking out the eyeliner that Mary Louise stabbed into her, making Caroline's skin like vervain so Mary Louise can't touch her, commiserating about how Mary Louise does not like it when people tease Nora.\nBut JK, it was all an act, because Valerie's totally obsessed with Stefan. Stefan can't touch Caroline either and that's why they don't escape in time! Well, really, lack of hustle is why they can't escape in time. But this spell is gonna really affect making out.\nAnyway, Nora shows Caroline Stefan's old diary, which has an entry about a time when he met a wonderful girl named Valerie. I gasped. Amazing! This is so much fun. This show is just candy. Nom, nom, nom .\nSteroline hits a rough patch (or a rough few years). Continuing on this candy thing, these flash-forwards are like delicious jellybeans. I hope they flash-forward to Alaric and he's just like, living happily with Jo. Or happy, but not with Jo. What I'm saying is: This Phoenix Stone stuff is a bummer and I just want to know how it turns out immediately.\nFuture Caroline is producing a news show in Dallas with exactly the tenacity, competence, and tough-but-fair attitude you'd expect from her. It's like a glimpse of what her life would be like if she weren't a vampire. It's great … until you remember that being a vampire makes her even more of a BAMF and maybe she's not living up to her full potential here. Shouldn't she be the Queen of New Orleans or something by now?\nAnyway, at the beginning of the episode Caroline's assistant tells her that her fiancé called and was maybe trying to test the waters about visiting Mystic Falls before the wedding. She says, \"But he knows that we can't go back there.\" Now, we've all watched TV before, so I hope we all knew this couldn't be Stefan.\nCut to the end of the episode, when her assistant mentions that Stefan Salvatore also called (confirming that he is not her fiancé), and Caroline says she legit never, ever, ever wants to hear his name again. What happened? Only time will tell. Don't lose hope, Steroline shippers, one to three years of turmoil is nothing when it comes to eternity.\nBut who is she engaged to? It's probably Matt, right? I wouldn't like it. He's her high school love, not her forever love. Plus, he's still gonna die way before her. Alaric? LOL, would that make sense? Enzo would be the real curveball. I mean, there's always the \"unknown third party\" option. However, she did say \"we\" can't return to Mystic Falls which seems to imply it is someone viewers already know. And presumably she's not gonna marry a random human/mortal for only a brief period of happiness with him before he begins to age. Oh wait, disregard all of this. It's Klaus. It's totally Klaus.\nAnyway, she gets staked, not killed though, at the end of the episode. Whoever this mysterious enemy is, one thing is for sure: She is pissed !\n​Follow Sarah on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sarahccaldwell"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:39:56.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
