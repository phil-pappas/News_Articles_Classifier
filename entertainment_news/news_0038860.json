Visiting CBS' \" The Talk \" on Friday morning, October 23, the actress brought along an image of her character's alter ego Killer Frost and shared it with the viewers at the studio and home. In the image, Danielle is dressed in a blue top and sports lipstick of the same hue. She trades her brunette locks with a blonde wig. It's unclear though if Killer Frost is Caitlin in the future or the Earth-2 version of Caitlin Read. Gushing about Killer Frost's costume, Danielle said, \"It was awesome. I'm so excited. I'm such a girl and I loved getting dressed up in that look. We started working on the look a couple of months before it actually shot. Our first suit was like a Catwoman, a one-piece, very sexy, but it didn't feel quite right. So, we changed it to be a top and these really cool leather pants, and the hair was awesome. It started as this short little pixie wig, and we just kept adding more and more hair.\" \"I'm jealous. All those boys get to suit up and duke it out. I want to suit up with those boys, for sure,\" she continued, adding that she couldn't wait until the time comes. While Killer Frost is known as a villain in the comic books, Caitlin is currently still helping Barry Allen ( Grant Gustin ) as part of S.T.A.R Labs. Recently asked if the assumption that Ronnie Raymond ( Robbie Amell ) could be on a different Earth would drive Caitlin to become Killer Frost, executive producer Andrew Kreisberg said, \"Everything that happens on this show is going to slowly push her there.\" He went on teasing, \"How and when it happens is obviously something we'd like to keep on the down low. For those people who are hoping to one day see Caitlin do that, I can't promise it'll be as soon as you want, but it's definitely in the future.\" \"The Flash\" airs Tuesdays at 8 P.M. on The CW. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:06:32.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
