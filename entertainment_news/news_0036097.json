In some ways, this is quite literal: the EP was written in Berlin, then recorded on a cattle property in rural NSW. It's an expansive, textured collection with a strong indie-rock vibe; distorted electric guitar is the most prominent new sound, taking over from its acoustic cousin for the majority of tracks. Joining the crunchy power chords are buzzing layers of synth and driving rock beats, propelling the momentum in a way Donoughue's understated vocals are not designed to do. The pensive edge of previous work is still evident, though admittedly with a positive counterbalance: \"Things aren't as bad as they seem/Things aren't as bad as they could be\" ( Wait ). Lo-fi acoustic number The Roleplay closes the album on a resigned, but philosophical, note. JESSIE CUNNIFFE \nJemma and the Clifton Hillbillies\nJEMMA AND THE CLIFTON HILLBILLIES (Independent) \n★★★★ \nJemma and The Clifton Hillbillies. \nFor a while now, Melbourne has been somewhat of an alt.country hotbed, the cramped and sticky-carpeted venues of the inner north a breeding ground for a new take on this earthy, gritty style of the genre. Jemma Rowlands, her Clifton Hillbillies in tow, is a fine example of the talent emerging, as the band's debut illustrates. Beginning with the mournfully catchy April's Fool , this eponymous release bleeds the honesty inherent to this style of music, enhanced by some of the finest instrumentation this side of Nashville courtesy of Sean McMahon (guitar), Ben Mastwyk (banjo), Cal Walker (bass) and Ben Franz (pedal steel), among a host of others. Town For Two and Song Itself keep things jaunty, while Fightin' Mad and Killing Time are pure, slow old country (the latter with subtle accordion from Flora Smith). Meanwhile, Rowlands' voice should be bottled and sold to thirsty travellers – all up, a masterful record. SAMUEL J. FELL \nAdvertisement Promised Land Sound\nFOR USE AND DELIGHT (Paradise of Bachelors/Rocket) \n★★★★ \nCountry rock is not exactly fashionable at the moment, so it's a safe bet Promised Land Sound (PLS) are playing it for the right reasons – because they have to. This Nashville quintet has been evolving over a few years, rotating members as they hone a sound informed by the past as well as the present. Yes, some songs echo Bob Dylan in delivery and lyrics, but it's more inspiration than imitation. And any band with the good taste to invoke Emitt Rhodes ( She Takes Me Well ) deserves respect. Recorded in the same studio as label-mate Steve Gunn, the production they have achieved has an equally crisp earthiness. Gunn's technique of psychedelia through exploratory musicianship has also clearly encouraged PLS to let their songs travel, and the result is a second album of distinct personality. With three vocalists, and a perfect balance of swing, punch and sensitivity, this is music that casually enters a room and wins the attention of everyone present. SEAN RABIN \nPromised Land Sound: For Use and Delight . Photo: Supplied \nThe Doors\nOTHER VOICES / FULL CIRCLE (Rhino /Warners) \n★★&frac12; \nI could only imagine the uneasy feeling in the Doors' camp in 1971 and '72, when these two post-Jim Morrison albums, now reissued, were recorded. And as this pair proves, even though Ray Manzarek sometimes sat in on vocals when old Jimbo went AWOL, his gruff growl can't carry one album, let alone two – guitarist Robbie Krieger also sings – while sans Jim, their lyrics lacked swagger, pretension and / or drama. (Neither I'm Horny I'm Stoned or Variety Is The Spice of Life rate as career highs.) Other Voices , which sticks tightly to the back-to-the-bars grittiness of their final records with Morrison, is historically noteworthy, because it comprises the backing tracks intended for the album to follow LA Woman . The plan was for the Lizard King to eventually return from exile in Paris, get into the studio and unleash his inner poet. We all know what happened next. JEFF APTER \nHealth\nDEATH MAGIC (Caroline Australia) \n★★★&frac12; \nThe Doors: Full Circle . \nLos Angeles outfit Health arrived in 2007 with their self-titled debut of jagged and destructive noise rock, loaded up on live drums and heavy guitar. Death Magic , their third, moves closer to modern gothic rock with nods to Nine Inch Nails and Depeche Mode. Under Jake Duzsik's ghostly vocals, they still flip from atmospheric to aggressive but now via muddied sub-bass drums and effect-laden synthesisers. Electronic, epic and cinematic, it also follows their 2012 scoring of video game Max Payne 3 , and makes it their most accessible record to date. Men Today is adrenalin-filled industrial and most like their older stuff but Stonefist precedes it, mixing ambience with surging rock agitation. Flesh World (UK) recalls Underworld's fast, dark beats while the balladry of Dark Enough and LA Looks' melodies and hip-hop beat take them to the brink of pop. Death Magic remains unsettling, but fans will either mourn the chaos or will welcome cohesion.
