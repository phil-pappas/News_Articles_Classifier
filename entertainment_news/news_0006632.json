We've been celebrating film now for five years, and it was time to bring in an element that would strengthen our local industry here. \n\"Bringing in these panels from very well-established organizations, entertainment lawyers, some producers from Toronto -- bringing these elements here will hopefully give something new to people who are attending, and they can use that as a basis for what they need to do next in film, not only as a hobby but as a business.\" \nThe festivities kick off Friday with an opening night gala at the Bourbon Room (400 Dalhousie St.) with a '90s theme, featuring Maestro Fresh Wes and Ottawa-born Degrassi star Melinda Shankar. \n\"I'm a '90s child and I think it's the best decade of all time, of course, but it wasn't just about doing a 90s party for fun, it was about doing an opening night gala in a different way. Wine and cheese is so overdone,\" said Bains. \n\"We wanted an event that brings the industry together, launches the festival in a very festive way, and having an artist that's really in line with the spirit of the festival, with music and film, and Maestro Fresh Wes made that crossover very successfully.\" \nFifty weekend screenings will feature music videos, shorts, documentaries, web series and feature-length films with an international flavour -- with entries from Ethiopia, Norway, Finland, Chile, South Korea, Iraq, the U.S. and Canada, and will also feature two locally-produced features from Ottawa filmmakers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:31:47.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
