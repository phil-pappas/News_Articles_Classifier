Entertainment (LOS ANGELES) -- Caitlyn Jenner will not face criminal charges in the February crash that resulted in the death of another driver. \nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney said Wednesday that Jenner was driving below the speed limit and that the \"suspect engaged brakes\" before impact. \n\"Crime requires violation of misdemeanor or infraction,\" said the D.A. in a statement, adding that \"based on facts, cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that suspect's conduct was unreasonable.\" \nJenner had been facing vehicular manslaughter charges. \nBlair Berk, Jenner's attorney, said of the news, \"We believed from the start that a thorough and objective investigation would clear Caitlyn of any criminal wrongdoing. We are heartened the District Attorney has agreed that even a misdemeanor charge would be inappropriate. A traffic accident, however devastating and heartbreaking when a life is lost, is not necessarily a criminal matter.\" \nDriver Kim Howe, 69, died after the former Olympian and reality star hit Howe’s white Lexus, causing the car to roll into oncoming traffic and crash into a Humvee. There was no evidence that Jenner was impaired or texting, police said at the time of the accident. \nJenner was also served with a wrongful death lawsuit in May from Howe's stepchildren. Jenner's legal team has asked the court to dismiss the civil case. \n\"The DA’s decision not to pursue criminal charges places even more importance on our clients’ lawsuit. It is abundantly clear is that Ms. Jenner’s inattentive driving caused this rear-end collision that resulted in Ms. Howe’s death,\" said Jeffrey D. Wolf, a lawyer for Howe's stepdaughter Dana Redmond. \"Now, ultimately a jury trial in this civil case is the only way to hold Ms. Jenner accountable for causing Kim Howe’s death. We are going to continue our efforts to ensure that justice is served.” \n  Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 9:00AM by", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:03:58.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
