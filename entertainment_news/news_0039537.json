On Wednesday, October 21, 2015, Marty McFly of the epic “ Back to the Future ” saga time traveled into the future, commemorating today as Back to the Future Day.\nMarty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, was first introduced to movie theaters in 1985. When Marty’s eccentric mentor, Dr. Emmett “Doc” Brown (Christopher Lloyd), builds a time machine out of a DeLorean car, Marty is sent 30 years back into the past, where he must make sure his parents meet and fall in love, or risk wiping himself and his siblings from present day existence.\nIn the 1989 sequel, “ Back to the Future Part II ,” Marty McFly travels into the future to October 21, 2015 in Hill Valley, California, where he must change the course of fate again to avoid a dim and depressing future. Two years later in 1990, “Back to the Future Part III” was released, in which Marty and Doc are sent back in time the furthest they’ve ever been—1885. Marty must save Doc from his death at the hands of the wicked Buford “Mad Dog” Tannen.\nWhile some of the “Back to the Future Part II” predictions did not occur, such as Jaws 19 and flying cars, the iconic characters of the film are still beloved by audiences of all ages. The “Back to the Future” trilogy is considered by many to be one of the greatest in the history of modern cinema. Directed and co-written by Robert Zemeckis, one of the top directors of the 1980s, these films captured the hearts of audiences nationwide.\nTo celebrate Back to the Future Day, the Cinemark Theater in Towson, Maryland is selling tickets for a triple-feature showing of all three “Back to the Future” films.
