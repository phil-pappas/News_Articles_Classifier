Knightly did not break character and the man was heard to say: \"Five seconds is too long to wait for a response!\" An usher came and escorted the man back to his seat. When security arrived, the man tossed the flowers on his way out.\n\"Therese Raquin,\" written in 1867, is about a woman trapped in a loveless marriage who embarks on an illicit affair with a friend of her husband's. The story has been adapted into a 1953 film starring Simone Signoret and another recently starring Elizabeth Olsen.\nKnightley made her West End debut in 2009 in the comedy \"The Misanthrope\" and two years later starred in Lillian Hellman's \"The Children's Hour.\"\n___\nOnline: http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/Therese-Raquin.aspx\n Professional Theater Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/Therese-Raquin.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:04:38.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
