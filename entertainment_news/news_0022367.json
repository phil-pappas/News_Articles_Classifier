Those who do will receive drink and food tickets to exchange for lemonade, tea, hot dogs or hamburgers that will be grilled during the event. You can purchase food and drink tickets and those proceeds go to the Humane Society. \nBark-Toberfest is from noon to 7 p.m. Saturday at 3521 S. Lone Pine, and includes live music by Brookline Station as well as the Nobo’s. Bring a lawn chair or blanket. \nThere will be a pet costume contest and other games. \nRepresentatives from Humane Society will be on hand and there will be pets available for adoption. \nSummit Brewing Co., out of Minneapolis, will sell beer. The bike shop will have its regular menu, too. \nMuetzel said he and his business partner and many friends all have rescue pets which is why they wanted to organize this event. \nAlso, a lot of their customers are dog lovers who bring their dogs out the sandwich shop. \n“The response has been huge,” he said. “Social media has been very kind to us. So much to the point I am rounding up extra tables.” \nWant to go? \nBark-toberfest is from noon to 7 p.m. Saturday at Sequiota Bike Shop, 3521 S. Lone Pine. Bring a lawn chair or blanket. Live music. Admission is free. It’s a fundraiser for the Humane Society so bring cleaning supplies or pet food or cash to donate.
