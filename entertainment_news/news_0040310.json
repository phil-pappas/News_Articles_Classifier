He was 78. He had been hospitalised for the last 40 days after a stroke and had been discharged on Monday.\nToogudeepa, Lagna Patrike, Mane Katti Nodu, Kulla Agent 000, Malaya-maruta, Mithileya Seeteyaru are some of the 35 films he directed. He has acted in hundreds of films in his career of over five decades. He last acted in Dodmane Hudga which is yet to be released. He was also a singer. Among his best known songs are 'Suryangu Chandrangu' from Shubha Mangala and 'Yavvanada Holeyalli' from Sangharsha. After 30 years, he sang 'Ille Swarga Ille Naraka' from the film Nagarahole for another film last year.\nAs per his wishes, Swamy's eyes were donated and his body was donated to MS Ramaiah Hospital. He is the second actor after Lokesh whose body was donated for medical training purpose. Coming from a conservative background, the decision to donate his body surprised many. But those close to him say he developed an iconoclastic attitude pretty early.\nHis full name was Kikkeri Shamanna Lakshminarasimha Swamy, though he was popularly known as Ravee. Born on February 21, 1939, he was attached to acting from a young age. Even when still a student, he landed a small role in Rathnamanjari. His career in films shaped up with his role as an assistant director in Thaayi Karulu. His first film as an independent director was Toogudeepa. The film's name became the family name of 'Toogudeepa' Srinivas, the fater of Darshan. Srinivas began his career in this film.\nSrinath became a lead actor with Ravee's Lagna Patrike. As a director, Ravee handled all genres of films including mythological. Bhale Adrushtavo Adrushta, Aaru Mooru Ombaththu, Srikrishna Rukmini Sathyabhama, Bhagyajothi, Magiya Kanasu and Malaya Marutha are testimony to his varied oeuvre.\nRavee also produced 13 films including acclaimed ones like Shubha Mangala, Jamboo Savari, Mithileya Seetheyaru and Harakeya Kuri. Jamboo Savari won the national award for Best Children's Film and went on a world tour of various festivals. The films he produced showed him coming out of the commercial mould to make serious films. Harakeya Kuri was the film that showcased Prakash Rai's talent and marked the beginning of his career.\nRavee had a close association with SR Puttanna Kanagal. After Kanagal's death, Ravee completed two of his unfinished films; Masanada Hoovu and v. Swamy is the recipient of the Puttanna Kanagal Award for the year 1994-95. Ravee is survived by his wife BV Radha, who is also an actress, and two daughters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:08:12.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
