Young, born in Chicago and raised in Cassville, dabbled in rap during middle school but fully embraced it just two years ago. This decision has created a conflict that he explores in music. \nShould I quit school, really chase this dream full time? \nI can’t let my family down, but it’s killing me inside. \n“I was going to school full time, working full time and trying to do music full time. I had to cut out one of the three,” said Young, who had been studying entertainment management at Northwest Arkansas Community College, Missouri Southern State University, and most recently Missouri State University. For more information, listen to “Blue Dream.” \nDuring the year since he left MSU, he collaborated with acts from Los Angeles and Dodge City, Kan., on the Can’t Sleep Tour, produced an album of original work and made two television appearances. \nEven with these accomplishments, he often feels unsettled, as set forth in “Survivor’s Remorse” — \nThere's so much I wanna say, but even more I bottle up. Outside looking in, it's like I got it all figured out. Reality my biggest weakness is my self doubt. \nConversely, skeptics and detractors seem to toughen him up. \nLove to hate when they see you doing better for yourself. \nHate to love cause they really just disgusted themselves. \nI'm the author of my own book. I'm just giving back what the game took. \nLook him up on SoundCloud for details. \nYoung described a creative cycle starting with experience and strong feeling, proceeding to words, which in turn deploy emotions during performance. Young said he’s a stickler for factuality and truth in his work. He insists on writing without deviating from the details of the source experience, down to the color of the shirt he was wearing, he said. \nIn performance, the goal is to bring out “the real emotion that’s in the words,” he said. \nYoung will be performing Saturday at Billiards of Springfield in an evening of multiple bands to raise funds for Glo Community Center. For this show, Young will be working for the first time with a live band, the indie group Histories. \n“It’ll be a step up for sure. Live instruments are automatically better,” he said. \nEd Peaco writes about locally grown Ozarks music for the News-Leader. Contact him at 417-413-9029 or EdPeaco@gmail.com \nWant to go?
