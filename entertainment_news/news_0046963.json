Julia channeled Anna Wintour by wearing a short, cropped, auburn wig and large black sunglasses. The \"Pretty Woman\" actress was seen sporting a long, padded black coat. While the haircut and shades are two signatures of Anna, Julia is unlikely to star as the famous Vogue editor-in-chief in the movie. She plays a mother named Miranda. Directed by Garry Marshall (\" Valentine's Day \" and \" New Year's Eve \"), \"Mother's Day\" is a dramedy which follows the lives of many mothers. Julia stars alongside Jennifer Aniston , Brittany Robertson , Kate Hudson , Hilary Duff , Sarah Chalke , Shay Mitchell , Margo Martindale, Timothy Olyphant and Jason Sudeikis . The film is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on April 29, 2016. Julia has two other upcoming movies. She stars in \" Secret in Their Eyes \" alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nicole Kidman . The thriller flick is set to be released on November 20. Julia and George Clooney also star in Jodie Foster 's movie \" Money Monster \" which is slated for an April 8, 2016 release. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Mother's Day News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:23:42.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
