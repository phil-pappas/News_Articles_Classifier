Responses are due by Thursday, Oct. 15. \nThe RFI is for interior planners and architects to lighting and sound designers to talent buyers and construction workers, among many others, to create a non-stop venue and destination for the region's best entertainment, dining and events. 350 Pine is calling on the most dedicated of people to be a part of the team that will breathe new life into the wonderfully unique space and harness the power of live music and the performing arts. \nFormerly Vault 350, the venue is no stranger to fame with hosted acts ranging from The B-52s and Tower of Power to Kanye West and Eddie Money to The Addicts and Smokey Robinson. \nThe famous building is also lush in architectural and artistic history. It was built in 1921, spans some 29,000 square feet that runs up and down three stories and the building's facade features a mosaic mural thought to be attributed to famed artist Millard Sheets. The colorful piece, an ode to the beginnings of Long Beach's industrial era, sits majestically above the marquee and visitors' entrance. Once inside, a grand main hall with a ceiling that gleams from its gold-leaf details and borders etched with Greek Revival imagery offers guests a distinctly elegant vision from the past. \nFew classic venues have stood the test of time from The Fillmore and El Rey Theatre to the Bowery and The Wiltern; 350 Pine joins them and the RFI is the first step in restoring its former glory. \nAll responses will be accepted by U.S. Postal Service traditional mail only; no electronic or telephone submissions will be accepted. Submissions must be received by October 15 with follow-up beginning at the end of October. Mail responses to include a resume, cover letter, and any visual examples (CD/DVD/USB accepted) to: 701 Pine Ave. #528, Long Beach CA 90813 .
