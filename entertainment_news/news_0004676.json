And when the scene was over, he continued and did something that made me cry in the tent. I've never done that before.\"The head of my company, Jason Taylor, grabbed a Kleenex. Simon Kinberg, the writer who has no emotions at all, actually became emotional. © 20th Century Fox \"It was so beautiful. I've never seen an actor do this for me, and he just took the scene to a whole another level.\"It's a heartbreaking scene, not a typical comic book movie scene at all, so let's hope it makes the cut.\"But after he did it, I went up to him and I hugged him and I said, 'Michael, thank you for that gift. Now I need you to do it again'. And he did it, and f**king rocked it again with full emotion. This guy is amazing.\" © Amanda Edwards/Getty Images for HRC.org Singer also teased that X-Men: Apocalypse will likely be the longest in the series so far, \"wrapping up\" six movies at the same time.X-Men Apocalypse is scheduled for May 19, 2016 in the UK and May 27 in the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:04:30.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
