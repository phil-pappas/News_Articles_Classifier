In doing so, I found out that each section of the track has a different name. \nThere's Conrod Straight, for example: the fastest section of the track where drivers can reach up to 300kmh. I discovered that Conrod Straight got its name after the conrod in one of the driver's cars failed on that section during one of the many Bathurst races (in case you didn't know, the conrod connects the piston to the crankshaft). \nThen there's the Esses, named for S shapes as drivers come down the mountain. My favourite part of the track would probably be Pit Straight, because that's where those speedy mechanics do their thing in a matter of seconds. \nGee, what I wouldn't give to have a pit crew looking after my car. They would be able to change a tyre in less than a minute, and have the whole thing rebuilt in the time it took me to do my face up, if not quicker. They'd probably even be sitting around drinking coffee by the time I scooted out to the car. \nAnyway, my point is, watching the Bathurst 1000 was better than I thought it would be. \nIt was nice to see an all-girl team in the mix, too, even if one of the drivers crashed into a wall and had to have the car rebuilt. It was the same spot in which Chaz Mostert crashed with dire consequences, so driver Gracie was lucky to escape with just the car being damaged. \nAnd another thing: the girls finished the race. That's a pretty big achievement in a male-dominated sport in my book. \nWhen the race progressed to lap 140 of 161, things really got down to business. This was the point where drivers really gunned it and showed off their skills behind the wheel at top speed and I was happy to see Craig Lowndes cross the finish line first, giving him his sixth title at the mountain. \nGood work, Craig. See you next year. bathurst 1000", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:25:11.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
