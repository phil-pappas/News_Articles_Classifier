He just needs a mullet. advertisement | your ad here According to the Hollywood Reporter, CBS is rebooting MacGyver. Though typically wed be skeptical of yet another take on an existing Hollywood property, its entirely possible that MacGyver will be just the thing to break out of the rehash slump. Heres why:1. James Wan, the brilliant Hollywood horror director who successfully helmed the most recent entry in the Fast and the Furious series, is attached to executive produce the project and direct the potential pilot, should the series development progress that far. Wans distinct visual style would inevitably be a stark departure from the CBS house style, an absolutely necessity for the network to lure a young audience.2. For all the reboots on previously successful television products that Hollywood has attempted over the last decade or so, CBS has one of the few unmitigated successes in Hawaii Five-0. The shows sixth-season premiere last month drew more than 8 million viewers and also boasts one of the most effortlessly diverse casts on television, particularly significant on a network that sometimes faces criticism for being too white. If a reboot on a previous TV property is going to be successful, CBS is as good a place as any for it to be.3. All you need is to find an undiscovered talent with the charisma of a young Richard Dean Anderson. We humbly submit Josh Holloway, since apparently no one is going to cast him in a Rockford Files reboot any time soon.4. If anyone is going to be capable of forcing America back into the 80s model of television consumption, its going to be MacGyver. Hell have all those pesky DVRs and streaming options dismantled in no time.5. Science is super cool right now. With The Martian earning $55 million at the box office, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson with a whopping 4.3 million Twitter followers and original recipe CSI going off the air, CBS has a readymade hit in science-friendly MacGyver. Pitched just the right way, MacGyver could reinvent the action-adventure genre like CSI reinvented the procedural.Although all of this may very well be true, its much more likely that MacGyver will not be the show that saves television, for one very simple reason.1. Reboots are not the future of television. Despite Netflixs Fuller House and Foxs Minority Report and NBCs Heroes and ABCs Uncle Buck and CBS Rush Hour, reboots are the exception to television success, not the rule.  Libby Hill, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:43:28.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
