Related Media A film about hunting down a local “King Jerry” and dumping him in Vail topped the competition at the annual NEPSA Video Awards on Thursday night. The 10th annual local ski-video competition’s winning movie, “Tag Em and Bag Em,” was made by Tae Westcott, Nate Berkel and Mike Cuccio. It featured Westcott getting a “Jerry Hunting Tag” in the mail and heading into the woods with Berkel and Cuccio, then shooting (with a Nerf gun) a tank-top wearing, gaper-gapped Jerry before leaving him on the highway in Aspen’s rival resort, “Where we always leave them.” It ended with the crowd-pleasing declaration: “Aspen, Colorado: Jerry-free zone!” The irreverent fare in the competition, opening the annual ski-film festival The Meeting, included a dozen entries riffing on three official themes: “Auto-Correct,” “Earn Your Turns” and “Jerry of the Day.” Colter Hinchliffe’s “Mom-O-Correct,” which took third place in the judged competition, featured the local big-mountain skier climbing the Black Canyon of the Gunnison and skiing the Alaska and Aspen backcountry while sending his mother text messages that comically downplayed the danger of his extreme exploits. Second-place winner “Trifecta,” by Derrin Carelli, featured three segments: hikers being swarmed by drones in the high country, a pair building Aspen Mountain out of clay (with impressive CGI animation) and an on-mountain shred session. Carelli also won the Audience Favorite award, which earned him a GoPro (the judged top-three winners took home $2,000, $1,000 and $500 in prize money, respectively). The entry from last year’s winners, brothers Andy and Charlie Curtis, featured a fake game show, “Earn Your Turns,” which pitted a pro-ho, a bro-brah and a Jerry from Dallas against one another, competing in dressing for a ski day and deciphering skiing-related auto-corrected text messages (“taking a fist in the dumper” correctly translates into “taking the FIS to the dumps,” for instance). The winner got a trip to “Jerry Mountain,” which, of course, was actually Vail. Along with the dozen films in competition, Aspen Skiing Co. screened all four short videos in its upcoming “Rejuvenate: Mind Body Spirit” campaign. They featured short profiles of Aspenites: paraplegic Amanda Boxtel on a monoski, Olympian Chris Klug teaching his daughter to ski, terrain-park builder Mark Pinter at work and National Geographic photographer Pete McBride talking about his hometown. “It’s a little deeper look,” Skico digital content marketing manager Harrison Buck said of the videos in the second season of the “Mind Body Spirit” campaign. “We decided to go with some locals who can really tell our story here.” The Meeting closes tonight with screenings of “686 Seconds,” “The Masquerade” and “Paradise Waits” in Wagner Park and “2032” at Belly Up Aspen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:56:37.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
