A scene from the 2015 Australian production of Les Miserables. Matt Murphy Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nLES Miserables fans can get a taste of the musical before it returns to Queensland for the first time in 16 years. \nA new exhibition celebrating the stage show's 30-year history is on display at QPAC's Tony Gould Gallery in Brisbane. \nThe free exhibit will whet the appetites of musical theatre fans ahead of the current Australian production's Brisbane season, which starts on November 10. \n\"I am sure audiences will find it fascinating to see how Victor Hugo inspired Alain Boublil, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Herbert Kretzmer to create this unique musical and how the power of their interpretation of Hugo's dramatic, passionate and moving story has inspired, touched and resonated with people all around the world,\" said producer Cameron Mackintosh, who contributed items from his personal collection. \nSince opening the production has staged more than 12,000 performances in London making it the world's longest running musical. \nExhibition highlights include original Les Miserables posters from around the world, the many faces of Cosette, photographs from the first rehearsals and performances in London and images of more recent performances including the current Helpmann Award-winning Australian production. \nFrom Page to Stage also features a selection of original costumes and other Les Miserables memorabilia. \nLes Miserables From Page to Stage can be seen until the end of the Brisbane season on January 3. cameron mackintosh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:41:48.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
