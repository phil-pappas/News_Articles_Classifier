With scant interviews, and hardly any words from Greenwood, \"Junun\" instead captures the musicians in full thrall while recording in a 15th century hilltop fort in between occasional power outages. \n\"Junun,\" which roughly translates as \"madness of love,\" will be released on the movie subscription platform MUBI on Friday. Its premiere at the New York Film Festival, where Anderson last year debuted his Thomas Pynchon adaptation \"Inherent Vice,\" was a low-key affair without a Q&A with Anderson. \nThe film, too, came with little explanation. Greenwood, who has scored Anderson's last three films (\"There Will Be Blood,\" ''The Master\" and \"Inherent Vice\"), would be considered by many to be the star of the documentary. \nBut the Radiohead guitarist remains largely in the background, thrust forward no more than the horn and percussion players of the Rajasthan Express. Their musical ability, sowed in generations of tradition, has a powerfully hypnotic effect. \nShooting digitally, and occasionally experimenting with drones that hover above the fort, \"Junun\" focuses on their intimate sessions of the East-West collaboration. When the electricity is running, there are few interruptions other than a handful of birds and the occasional nap. \n\"No toilet. No shower. But full power,\" says one musician.cos \nThe resulting album, produced by Nigel Godrich, is to be released by Nonesuch in November. \nFor Anderson, film and music are particularly intertwined. He's made music videos for Fiona Apple, Aimee Mann (whose songs made much of the soundtrack to his \"Magnolia\") and, most recently, Joanna Newsom. Before shooting her walking on New York streets for \"Sapokanikan,\" Newsom played the narrator of \"Inherent Vice.\" \n___ \nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP Copyright  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:58:44.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
