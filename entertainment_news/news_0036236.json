If everything goes sideways, you may be woefully unprepared.\nInterest is mounting locally as people want to know how to survive in the woods, perhaps in part due to rising popularity of survival programs like Dual Survival on The Discovery Channel.\nOne Rochester-based agency offers primitive skills and survival programs that span hours or days to help area residents connect with and explore nature while learning basic survival skills.\n\"There are so many hidden gems and slivers of green space in the area that people don't know exist,\" said Lindsay Cray, executive director and educator of the EarthWorks Institute . She strives to lead area residents to those natural spots and leads survival classes in area parks several times per week.\n“Our connection with nature is critical, as is understanding that you are as much a part of the world and nature as it is a part of you.”\nLindsay Cray, EarthWorks Institute The institute launched last fall to teach area residents primitive life skills, social responsibility and how to interact with nature. The lone survival school in the Rochester region is geared toward all ages — preschoolers to senior citizens, she said.\n\"Our connection with nature is critical, as is understanding that you are as much a part of the world and nature as it is a part of you,\" Cray said. \"We need to spend more time using and celebrating (local) green spaces to create a healthier, more vibrant community.\"\nCray said she also wants people to understand that they need not travel hours to explore state and national parks. Rochester-area parks have plenty to offer.\n\"It's right here, in your own backyard, where an adventure can happen in an hour,\" she said.\nAnd having the skill set to survive — even thrive — in the woods is unparalleled.\n\"When you know you can sustain yourself in the woods, you feel good about yourself and knowing that you are self-sufficient,\" she said. \"But you never know unless you try.\"\nEarthWorks executive director Lindsay Cray leads survival classes in Rochester-area parks, including how to build a campfire from scratch. Video by Victoria E. Freile\nInto the woods\nLast week, Cray led an introductory survival course at Tryon Park, a county park that spans Rochester and Irondequoit.\nThe hands-on class is designed to share the basic tenants of survival — how to make shelter and fire, how to find and safely prepare water and how to forage for food. With such skills, participants learn how to keep warm in wintry weather, where to look for food and how to find your way home.\nEight participants hiked together to an outdoor classroom in the northeast corner of the park. They paused several times mid-hike as Cray identified poisonous vegetation, like poison ivy.\nAfter a 10-minute walk, the group came upon a tent-shaped shelter of branches and leaves, built earlier this year by children through the institute's summer survival camp.\n“You are your number one enemy in the woods. If you are lost and panicking, you won't make wise decisions.”\nLindsay Cray \"You are your number one enemy in the woods,\" she told the group. \"If you are lost and panicking, you won't make wise decisions.\"\nThe group split into pairs and scoured the forest for broken branches and sticks to create their own miniature shelters.\nUsing a Y-shaped branch supported by a larger tree as the shelter's base, students stacked smaller sticks resembling ribbing to create shelter. They then coated each mini shelter with dried leaves, moss and other debris, as protection from the elements.\nLaura Kriegel, 25, of Rochester enrolled in the class to learn more about surviving in the woods. Along with Jack Schott of Irondequoit, Kriegel runs a summer camp for children near Binghamton, and said she is always looking for new outdoor skills to share with her overnight campers.\nSchott, 27, who skirted around a sea of poison ivy to gather sticks for his shelter, said he was excited to learn skills to share with campers.\n\"Plus I live down the road and haven't been to Tryon Park before,\" he said. \"That was a good enough reason to come.\"\nBuy Photo A friction method kit to start a fire used during a survival skills beginner class at Tryon Park. (Photo: CARLOS ORTIZ, staff photographer)\nReal life skills\nCray said she walks students into the woods to teach skills they cannot learn by simply reading a book or watching a survival show or documentary on television.\nStudents also quickly learn that \"nothing is as easy as its made to look in TV,\" she said. \"Skills, like creating a fire, aren't skills you can pick up overnight. But you can with practice.\"\nClasses are held year-round in all types of weather, \"since you need to be prepared to survive in all sorts of elements\" and don't get to pick when you'll need to tap into those skills. \"Every season is a teachable season.\"\nJessica Parker, 21, of Rochester and Bradley DeLano, 26, of Irondequoit, used a two-person friction fire kit to try to create an ember that could potentially become a campfire.\nFollowing Cray's instructions, Parker applied pressure downward on the wooden drill as DeLano quickly shimmied a string wrapped around a spindle to create friction.\n\"Uh, oh! I think we're great at this,\" Parker said as smoke started rising from the squeaking drill.\n\"Wow, I think we are great at this,\" DeLano replied.\nUltimately, the duo created lots of smoke, but no ember. That didn't bother the pair, who both said they thought the lesson was both interesting and practical.\nSeveral feet away, Devin Floyd, 42, and Rachel O'Donnell, 41, both of Rochester, successfully created a glowing coal that Cray ushered into a small tinder nest she created from bark and cattails collected in the park.\nCoddling the nest above her mouth, Cray blew gently on the bundle. Smoke rose from the nest as it started to glow. Within a minute, a flame emerged and the survivalists cheered.\n\"That's the coolest thing I've ever seen anybody do,\" one participant said as Cray placed the burning nest by a pile of dry wood she already prepared within a nearby fire pit.\nFloyd said he and O'Donnell spent about 10 minutes using the friction kit incorrectly, and another 10 minutes \"doing it right\" before the coal emerged.\n\"The spindle went flying out, landing 10 feet away,\" O'Donnell said. \"There was a lot of smoke, so we figured we'd check it.\"\nThe small coal they created provided warmth for the class as the sun set.\n\"I've made a lot of campfires, but this was the first time I've done it using sticks,\" Floyd said with a laugh. The survival class was his first\nBuy Photo Darron Kriegel of Irondequoit creates a miniature shelter with sticks and leaves during a survival skills beginner class at Tryon Park.

Some focus on building tools, like bow making, while other courses teach students how to track or build primitive hunting traps or how to forage for food.\nCindy Culbert, 43, of Rochester enrolled in the introductory course to keep up with her survivalist daughters Lydia, 12, and Abigail, 9. The girls take a bi-monthly primitive skills class for homeschoolers led by Cray.\n\"Lydia took a survival class last winter in the snow and was hooked,\" Culbert said. \"Here I have the chance to learn too. I like that I'll be able to share this experience and knowledge with them.\"\nNow, the girls won't have to relay what they learned in class, Culbert said. Taking her own survival course will allow her to better assist her daughters as they practice skills, such as building a shelter, mid-hike.\nThe kids are out twice a month through the winter. Each season brings new circumstances and challenges, Culbert said.\n\"It all takes practice, but those who stick with it are a pretty hearty bunch,\" she said.\nVFREILE@Gannett.com\nBuy Photo Lindsay Cray, executive director of EarthWorks, point out the natural signs in the woods that tell weather patterns, sunlight direction and dangers ahead during a survival skills beginner class at Tryon Park.
