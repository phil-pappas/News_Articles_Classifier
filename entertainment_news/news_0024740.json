She was presented with the Fellowship prize by her former Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit co-star at the BFI London Film Festival Awards in London’s Banqueting House. \nThe honour tops Blanchett’s year at the 2015 festival, where two of her films – Carol and Truth – had gala screenings. (Joel Ryan/AP) \nShe previously said receiving the title is “absolutely marvellous”, adding: “I hope they’re not going to change their mind. It’s great. \n“The pedigree and the list of people who come before me is rather daunting but I’m really excited.” \nBlanchett, 46, joins previous winners of the BFI Fellowship such as Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Al Pacino and the late Christopher Lee, who were all honoured for their outstanding achievement on screen. \nRooney Mara, the actress’s co-star in Carol, said she is a worthy winner of the prize: “I can’t think of anyone more deserving. She is one of the greatest actresses that we have today.” Kristin Scott Thomas strikes a pose (Joel Ryan/AP) \nBlanchett was joined by stars such as Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristin Scott Thomas, Martin Freeman and Allen Leech at the ceremony, which was hosted by Jarvis Cocker.
