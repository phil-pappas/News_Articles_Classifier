All movie buffs and general audience will enjoy the film, that's how I've directed it\", said the Siruthai director. \nHe also went on to add a peculiar information about the film, he said, \"Ajith sir has done a never tried before role in his entire career. You will know what I am talking about when you witness the movie\". \nHis statement has once again stirred the curiosity among fans with some speculating that Vedalam might indeed be a horror flick. \nAM Rathnam, the film's producer exhibited confidence while speaking, he said, \"I have no doubts that Vedalam will go on to become an important film in Ajith sir's career\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:22:09.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
