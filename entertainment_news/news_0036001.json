Only thing to do is let em know. I'm not resisting, I'm doin what I want. (sic)\" \nIn the clip, the officers could be heard telling the 'See You Again' hitmaker to stop resisting their efforts to restrain him and Wiz replied: \"I'm not resisting, sir. I'm not resisting. I'm not resisting, sir.\" \nWiz also posted another clip of the confrontation, showing him being stopped by officers while on his hoverboard. \nHe told them: \"You can't do nothing anyway. What're you going to do put me into jail because I'm not going to listen to what you say? \n\"You can't do nothing, you can talk and have all the conversations that you want to.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:36:51.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
