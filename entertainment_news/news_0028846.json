It’s certainly the most rapturous, thanks to master filmmaker Hou Hsiao-Hsien, who won the directing prize at this year’s Cannes festival. In the 9 th Century Tang Dynasty, a stealthy killer for hire (Shu Qi) stalks her prey and wrestles with her conscience in silver birch forests and other wonders photographed in remote mainland China. The Tawainese filmmaker’s patient, unblinking camera eye may throw some martial-arts fans used to zooms, frantic editing and wilder technique in general. But this is an enveloping fantasy of another time, another place and stillness interrupted, periodically and violently, by some pretty cool moves. \"In a discussion with my team of young fight choreographers,\" Hou recently told NPR, \"I made a rule never to leave the ground. You don't want to be like Spider-Man swinging around.\" And yet \"The Assassin\" floats like a butterfly. \n6 p.m. Wednesday (repeats 8:15 p.m. Friday), AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Tickets $11-$14 at chicagofilmfestival.com . Running time: 2:00. \n-Michael Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:32:34.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
