This awesome, life-size predator sits at 42 inches and would be an awesome addition to the office or living room. The skeleton is white and ceramic. The most commonly produced statues made of plastic or resin molding. However, he believes, natural materials, such as ceramics and wood, were better for this piece. The natural color and rough texture of the white ceramic is very close to the nature of bones.\nThis ceramic dinosaur skeleton is a perfect gift for dinosaur lovers or a great collectible that can sit in an office. Own and enjoy this amazing piece of ceramic art! However, before everyone can own this predator, Kamillo needs help. That’s why he launched this campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $60,000 by November 16, 2015.\nTo help own this dinosaur skeleton artwork, please visit the IndieGoGo campaign or click here . Backers will receive their perk by July 2016.\nDon’t miss out on this great opportunity to own this incredible piece of ceramic art!\nKnow others that would love this?
