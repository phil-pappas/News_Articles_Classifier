No? Now's the time. Launched by Claude VonStroke , aka Barclay Crenshaw, Campout is launching alongside the 10th anniversary of West Coast house music label, DIRTYBIRD. Stacked with camp-friendly activities and heavy, heavy beats, this unique SoCal fest is not for the faint of heart and should not be missed.\nKnown for his funky brand of bass-heavy hits (often referred to as \" booty music\") the DJ kindly curated Maxim an exclusive playlist (scroll below) for your listening please. Next, we talked to the Dirtybird boss man on the Campout origin story, feeling like a kid again and what's next for the ludicrous label.\nWhat do you think of when someone says \"camp out\"?\nCooking marshmallows on a stick over a fire and telling ghost stories.\nWhy did you decide on a campout format? How does it fit with DIRTYBIRD?\nThe games and the overall feeling of being a kid again really works well with our special group of characters. Dirtybird is always about having fun, so this was the best way for us to do a festival.\nWhat activity are you most looking forward to and why?\nI think the talent show is going to be totally ridiculous just because I know a lot of the fans and I know what they are capable of!\nTug of war - who wins you or Grill$on?\nI might pull harder, but Grill$on is the chef... and you never want to beat the chef. (No one wants spit in their food.)\nHow did you put together such a rad line-up year one?\nEveryone who is playing this year really wanted to play. We didn't force anything. It's an extended friends and family party with a few people we respect highly who we wanted to see ourselves as fans. Most importantly we respect each artist on this line-up for being some sort of amazing talent or innovator. No fake stuff.\nWhat are some unexpected musical surprises fans can expect?\nI can't tell you the surprises because that would be a spoiler, but I promise there are some good ones! Wait and see!\nWhat does it mean to be launching a festival, the same year you celebrate ten years of DIRTYBIRD?\nIt's nerve wracking but also time to do it. The Do Lab has been so amazing producing this with us, we could never have done this without them. Much respect to that crew.\nWhat new releases are you excited about?\nThe new Justin Jay record “ Hit It ” is literally a show stopper every time I play it. The crowd freaks out without question. It's a super bomb and I'm excited to see what happens with it when it comes out in a couple weeks.\nWhat's next for the label?\nWe are going to revamp the merchandise department again and also put out the first Get Real record (myself and Green Velvet) There are also a bunch of other great releases coming as to be expected. Right now we are so focused on the BBQs and the Campout, it's hard to see past October.\nThe festival takes place this weekend from Oct. 2-4, and will feature Dirtybird’s own Claude VonStroke, Justin Martin, J Phlip, Kill Frenzy and Justin Jay, among others. In addition to the label’s own roster, house hit-makers like Lee Foss, &ME, Breach, and Benoit & Sergio will perform.\nWant more?
