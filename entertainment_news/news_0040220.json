Knight also faces a separate charge of making a criminal threat.\nProsecutors in the case have said if Knight is convicted they will seek a sentence of 25 years to life under California's three-strikes law, which gives stiffer sentences to those previously convicted of serious felonies. Knight has convictions from 1997 on two counts of assault with a deadly weapon.\nKnight, 50, who co-founded influential hip hop label Death Row Records, sat quietly in an orange jumpsuit wearing black glasses and with his feet chained during the hearing.\nKnight's attorney Thomas Mesereau told the court his client was with his son when he encountered photographer Leslie Redden, and that he was trying to protect the boy from public exposure.\n\"He never struggled with anyone, he never touched anyone,\" Mesereau said.\nRedden testified that she was videotaping Knight in an alley in Beverly Hills when he charged toward her.\n\"He called me a bitch. He said that he will beat my ass and then he said to someone, 'Take this bitch's camera,'\" Redden said, adding that she ran down the street and was chased by two people.\nBeverly Hills police detective Mark Schwartz said a surveillance video showed a woman throw Redden against a wall.\nOther footage played in court showed Williams, a comedian who was with Knight that day, walking toward Redden with nothing in his hands and then returning holding a camera, Schwartz said.\nWilliams' attorney Shawn Holley told the judge her client gave the camera to someone else.\n\"He had no intention to keep the camera,\" she said. \"The only purpose was to delete the images.\"\nCoen ordered an arraignment hearing for Knight and Williams for Oct. 27.\n(Reporting by Olga Grigoryants; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis ; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Eric Beech )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:05:32.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
