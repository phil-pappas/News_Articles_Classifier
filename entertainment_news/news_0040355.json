Comedy stars including Tracy Morgan, Kathy Griffin, and Trevor Noah joined the celebration. AP \nEddie Murphy just couldn't help himself. \nAs he graciously accepted the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on Sunday night at the Kennedy Center, he launched into an impression of another previous prize recipient: Bill Cosby, who received the honor in 2009. \nDespite declining to portray the disgraced comedian at Saturday Night Live 's 40th anniversary special -- he previously said he didn't find the topic funny -- Murphy looked at the bust of Mark Twain and posed the question, \"Bill has one of these. Did you all make him give it back?” \n\"You know you've (expletive) up when they want you to give your trophy back.\" \nThen came his Cosby impression: “I would like to talk to some of the people who feel like I should give back some of my (expletive) trophies,” he said. \nHonoree Eddie Murphy poses on the red carpet during the 18th Annual Mark Twain Prize For Humor at The John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on Oct. 18, 2015 in Washington.
