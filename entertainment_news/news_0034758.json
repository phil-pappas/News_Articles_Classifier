Nova Scotia beckons with \"The Stormy Scenes of Winter\" and France happily presents \"Noel Nouvelet – Sing We Now of Christmas.\"\nThere is a charm and freshness to this unconventional edition and, most importantly, a sense of joy and delight in music-making that cannot fail to cheer and lift the spirits, even on the bleakest of winter nights.\nEagerly anticipated, Winter's Delights follows on the consort's previous best-selling album On A Cold Winter's Day (888837615822).\nwww.quadriga-consort.at\nQuadriga Consort:\nElisabeth Kaplan – Voice; Angelika Huemer – Recorders, Viola da Gamba ; Karin Silldorff – Recorders; Dominika Teufel – Viola da Gamba ; Philipp Comploi – Basse de Violon ; Laurenz Schiffermueller – Percussion; Nikolaus Newerkla – Harpsichord, Arrangements, Direction\nTracklist:\nThe First Nowell\n(trad. carol, England ) Gloomy Winter\n(trad. strathspey, Scotland ) Leanabh an Aigh – The Blessed Child\n(carol to a traditional Scottish tune by Mary M.
