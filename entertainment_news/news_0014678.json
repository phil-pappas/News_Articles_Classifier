Photo: Steven Siewert \n\"You get a stick or a piece of wire and you beat it in the sand as you talk and then you draw,\" Ernabella Arts manager Hannah Kothe​ says. \"And it's like a comic strip, you clean the sand with your hand and then you draw in it and then you clean the sand and tell the next part of the story.\nAdvertisement \"That's the way stories are passed onto children mainly from a young age.\"\nEnglish is the second language for many people in the Pukatja community in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, more than 1400 kilometres from Adelaide and several hours' dusty, bumpy drive from Uluru.\nRenita Stanley who uses with vibrant colours to depict a place she calls Malilla. Photo: Steven Siewert \nThose dreaming stories are echoed in the Ernabella Arts centre where women artists are creating the next chapter of their culture on canvas and in clay.\nTheir latest artwork will be exhibited at the Tarnanthi Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art, which begins in Adelaide on October 8.\nOn a bright winter's morning, the art centre in the former mission kitchen is a hubbub of singing, gossiping, children running riot and camp dogs, their snouts blue and purple from nosing about in paint, being shooed away.\nSpear maker Graham Kulyuru. Photo: Steven Siewert \nIn the pottery room, handfuls of sand lay scattered around a large vase that Tjimpuna Williams decorates with her dreaming. The marks chipped into the vase correspond to intricate patterns she has traced in the sand with her fingers, which tell the story of Piltati.\nA complex tale of husbands turning themselves into snakes to track down and devour their missing wives, Kothe says it is \"a very twisted love story about relationships\".\n\"There's a lot of links between Tjimpuna's designs and her depictions of country, and the stories she was told as a child and that practice of storytelling,\" Kothe adds.\nIt is one of the stories relayed across generations of women through song, dance, storytelling and art, says Tarnanthi's artistic director Nici Cumpston. \"You can hear quite often the artists singing as they paint.\"\nA similar rhythm reverberates in the painting room where Pantjiti Lionel and her daughter Yurpiya sing stories they also paint on large canvases.\nNearby, Renita Stanley depicts with vibrant colours a place she calls Malilla, an important site for women and the source of creation stories about how the land was formed.\n\"These are stories that have been passed down and they're important,\" Kothe says. \"They tell you how to live. They have a moral agenda.\"\nTarnanthi (\"tar-nan-dee\") comes from the Kaurna language of the Adelaide Plains and describes the first light of dawn or a seed sprouting. The new festival, funded to the tune of $4 million by BHP Billiton is orchestrated by the Art Gallery of South Australia but plays across 22 venues in Adelaide.\nThe gallery's director Nick Mitzevich​ says the program of exhibitions, performances, talks and art fair is designed to offer a \"snapshot\" of Aboriginal art.\n\"What the festival aims to do is take a snapshot of what's happening within the areas of Indigenous art and not make distinctions between high art and low art or decorative arts or conceptual art,\" he says.\nTarnanthi features 300 artists, with 80 per cent of art on display new commissions. The Art Gallery of SA will also host Yhonnie Scarce 's cloud of 2000 blown-glass bush yams inspired by the Maralinga bomb blasts, the Bush Footy collection of painted wooden sculptures of AFL players and watercolours by descendants of Albert Namatjira.\nMore than 40 art centres will participate in the festival, including those scattered across the APY Lands. \n\"Again what we're trying to do is take the pulse of what is happening within those communities,\" Mitzevich says. \"For me what is interesting is with the decline of the primary art market there's been a great sense of ingenuity in Aboriginal communities.\"\nThe Indigenous art market, including sales of large-scale paintings, has been in decline in recent years, prompting art centres to produce smaller, more affordable work.\n\"You see the rise of ceramics, you see fabrics and textiles and design becoming more popular and I think this Tarnanthi festival aims to really show the diversity of what's going on in these communities,\" he says.\nNew works by Ernabella's women artists will feature in A Desert Salon at the gallery alongside landscape paintings from other art centres in the APY Lands, including Mimili Maku.\n\"Those two art centres seem to be really thriving at the moment with lots of artists at the top of their game, making works full of life and energy,\" Mitzevich says. \"In these isolated communities art is the answer. Art is the centre of community activity. The art centre is the hub where everyone comes together.\"\nIn the APY Lands, the work of artists not only continues age-old cultural traditions, but also provides the only source of non-government income.\nBut the art centres are not only vital for the 2500 people living in the often troubled APY Lands, Mitzevich wrote in an online essay . \"Art is the answer – a potent means of reclaiming culture and giving wider Australia a narrative, dare I say, an identity that sets us apart from the increasingly ubiquitous and globalised West.\"\nUnique in Indigenous art, women have long been at the forefront of Ernabella Arts since it was opened by missionaries in 1948 to produce hand-pulled rugs with wool produced from a nearby sheep station.\nIn the 1970s Ernabella artists travelled to Indonesia and brought back batik to the desert, while more recently, artists such as Williams have visited China and returned with skills in ceramics production.\nHowever, the artistic gender gap is closing with older men such as Dickie Minyintiri, the 2011 winner of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA). Graham Kulyuru is making spears for Tarnanthi as part of the Kulata Tjuta (Many Spears) project, which aims to pass on traditional knowledge and skills to younger men.\n\"The older stockmen that now can't ride a horse or are less mobile, they are coming into it,\" Mitzevich says. \"Obviously they're inspired by the success of many of the women artists in their communities.\"\nThe women of Mimili at the base of the Everard Ranges also play a gentle percussion on the land, tapping the ground to discover where water is located.\nKnowing the land and its bounty, such as the witchetty​ grubs that can be found by digging up acacia roots, is part of the knowledge shared from one generation to another, says senior artist Ngupulya Pumani, a finalist in this year's National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards.\n\"My mother she taught me everything. We used to go out in the bush and [she would] show us dreamings and bush foods.\" \nMimili Maku Arts has quickly made an impression in Indigenous arts since its creation in 2010, defying the market downturn to record a growth in art sales to almost half a million dollars last financial year.\nTwo of Mimili's artists – Betty Kuntiwa Pumani in painting and Robert Fielding in work on paper – won $5000 NATSIAA  prizes in Darwin in August.\nMitzevich says Mimili's stable of artists display a great sense of colour and pattern in depictions of country and tjukurpa (\"dreaming\") that reflects their intense knowledge of the landscape.\n\"What you see in those paintings from Mimili is this sense of excitement of change and regeneration,\" he says. \"This kind of palette that is so uncharacteristic but when you see country transitioning through weather, you see the inspiration and the pictures make sense. They're poetic and they're beautiful.\"\nTarnanthi Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art is in Adelaide from October 8 to 18. Exhibitions continue until January 17, 2016. \nThe writer travelled to the APY Lands as a guest of the Art Gallery of South Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:15:20.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
