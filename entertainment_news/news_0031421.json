I’m on the ground and I speak to a lot of these youth, and I can tell you that the reason why it requires a different way of doing things as to what we have previously done is because I’m seeing a lot of identity issues with the young men and women. \n“I keep hearing from many on the streets and in the schools that I visit that they tell us that we don’t belong; they say that we are not part of the Australian society. We are not part of the Australian community, that we are terrorists, that we are extremists, that our religion is one that is of destruction and loss of life and so on and so forth. \n“You’ve got to remember these people were born into the age of terror, and they are being told that they don’t belong. \n“What that leads to is to marginalisation, isolation, and if you add that to the mix of the propaganda that is being put forward by the groups like ISIS, it’s a very dangerous mix. \n“So you see that it requires a whole-of-society effort and that’s the reality of it. We can’t just do what we have done in the past. It really requires everyone to get on board.” \nWhen asked by host Tony Jones if he “had a clear idea” how the teenager was radicalised so quickly, Mr Charkwari said he didn’t, but that the entire community was trying to “track down” what happened. \n“Can I just add to that - this is a very complex issue,” he added. “This is a human problem. If we take this issue and we restrict it to the Muslim narrative and we say that this is a Muslim problem, what happens is you can’t then step back and look for other empirical evidence as to any underpinning or driving forces that may be at hand here. \n“This is a universal phenomenon. You know, terrorism did not begin with September 11 and neither did it begin after the Cold War, or Munich, or Oaklahoma. \n“This has been a universal problem. It’s a cyclical problem that has touched every age and every religion. We have to look at it in terms of what are the other driving factors influencing this very issue. I think if we simply restrict it, we are never going to break that cycle.” We never take the vilification of people into account, says @KenWyattMP . Wesam Charkawi says it's universal #QandA http://t.co/FOuwi86IVF — ABC Q&A (@QandA) October 12, 2015 \nGreens MP Adam told the audience he believed lack of engagement and unemployment contributed to the isolation of Muslim youths in our society. \n“There are children who are born here who have gone to Melbourne uni or RMIT or Sydney uni, get a degree, they send off applications for job interviews, they don’t get a call and as soon as you change your name from Mohammad to David the phone starts ringing,” he told the audience. “When people are feeling that, looking at their parents saying you’ve worked really hard and you don’t seem to find meaningful work, then we I think ourselves as a society are helping create some of the conditions that make it easier for others to then come along and say, see, this society doesn’t have a place for you.” \nTasmanian Labor senator Lisa Singh said she did not think the language used by the Government over the last couple of years was inclusive. \n“I think it’s been quite divisive,” she said. “It is my hope obviously under a new Prime Minister, joining with our leader, Bill Shorten, that that dialogue, language, that rhetoric, changes, and it comes back to the proud multicultural country that we know, of inclusiveness, of respect for \ndiversity, of ensuring that each and every one of us, no matter what your religion, what your background, you can make it in this country.” \nMr Charkwari said he also believed there was a general level of misunderstanding of the Muslim faith in Australian society. \n“A lot of the people that I come across when I visit and go to the outback is they tell me, you know, does your religion say to do this and does your religion say to do that?,” he explained. “I honestly find that sometimes there is a misunderstanding. I think that the only way that we are going to remove this misunderstanding is engagement. \n“So we need to engage one another. We need to put a face to the person that the people fear. I think Islam is feared because it’s misunderstood. \n“Not many people know what it stands for. I tell you that I would help any person regardless of their faith, regardless of their background, even if they are atheist. \n“These are our core principles. This cannot be disputed.” \nWhen asked how authorities could help to de-radicalise young men and women, the Sheikh said they should approach it in the same way the Government has approached domestic violence - by not tarring everyone with the same brush. \n“In Australia, domestic violence is tackled through - they tackle mental health issues, they provide awareness campaigns, they counter the narrative. They have support services. So they do that in a way that doesn’t demonise all men,” he said. “I think that’s how we have to start looking at this issue. We can’t just really narrow down the scope of things to one side. In terms of the funding, sometimes some things can be fixed for free. \n“If you change the language, I mean, this can have a profound effect. \n“When somebody like the Prime Minister comes out and says, you know, we shouldn’t discriminate and so on and so forth and speaks about respect, that makes my job far more easy and effective. \n“When you look at the opposite of that, when you have somebody who says we want Muslims to talk about peace and mean it, it’s very, very hurtful and it makes my job far more difficult and these are the differences. In terms of funding, we can’t just look at this whole issue through the prism of counter-terrorism legislation. It’s not going to work just like that. We spend so much money on it. Mind you, less than one per cent of all of that funding went into communities. Less than one per cent. So ultimately, at the end of the day, we need a new strategy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:10:10.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
