Intense complexities of personality and situation between them, fueled by one sailor's criminal greed and desire to dominate in the drug world, and another's, whose attempt to right a situation that's gotten clean out of hand will probably cost him dearly. Yet he fights back against his enemy for no more reason than an amazing woman's love and his family's American pride. A cast of Asian soldiers and crooked drug agents, nightmarish scenes of Bangkok and hard-core violence upon a discontented ship where a rough bunch of American sailors are just about one bust away from raising the \"jolly roger\"; these characters, even the small ones in scope are nailed and salted with just the right amount of local color and physical detail as to be pleasing (or not) and memorable (for sure). The novel is comprised of three interconnected elemental disciplines; historical/international noir (Le Carre or Ludlum) The Military \"realism\" such as (Wouk/McKenna); and finally the last third which resonates with description and narrative of rural Northwest America and the prose of personal love, honor and retaliation. The women of this novel are multi-faceted and have been granted true perspective without pretense. There are as well various patriots, criminals, cowboys and innocents, barflies and ladies of the West and East- all at their best and worst behaviors- that populate this blend of historical fiction told in sharp noir prose which the writer explores inside this world of yet another failed American War. The Military section is rife with shipboard action and humor that smacks of an authenticity of Naval Fiction rarely seen since \"The Sand Pebbles.\" The resolution of this book is told in the self-restrained, yet vibrant, voice of a writer who understands that poetry is love. The characters in this story are young, Billy and his girlfriend Laura, yet between them is the love and courage to act on the truth... without mitigation or denial...especially in the face of Billy's unusual hardship during his young life.\nReaders who wish to experience this profound work can purchase “Wildcat” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
