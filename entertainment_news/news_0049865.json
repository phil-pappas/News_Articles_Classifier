They are director Dave Tinsch, originally from Syracuse; recipe developer Patty Rosenthal, originally from Westvale; and host Howard Rosenthal, originally from DeWitt. Mr. Food Test Kitchen Now, he's finally on the air in his hometown, Syracuse .\n\"Mr. Food Test Kitchen\" began airing in 90-second segments about two weeks ago on Syracuse's Fox68 (WSYT) and its web site . Fox68 is the only station in the country on which \"Mr. Food\" is not aired during a news broadcast, Rosenthal said.\nInstead, it runs at 3:52 p.m. weekdays near the end of \"FABLife,\" and at several other random times during the day, said Fox68 general manager Don O'Connor. There is a new segment each weekday. This week's focus has been fall-themed German specialties, like Pork Schnitzel and Sauerbraten.\nIt's been several years since the show -- formerly called \"Mr. Food\" with host Art Ginsburg -- ran in the Syracuse market, on WTVH-Channel 5. Ginsburg, who died in 2012, was noted for both his simple, affordable recipes and his signature catch phrase, \"Oooh! It's so good!\"\nRosenthal's presence on the show continues its Upstate New York connections.\nIn Central New York, Rosenthal, a graduate of Jamesville-DeWitt High School, ran both a catering business (Yankel & Co.) and a restaurant (Taste of Broadway in Fayetteville). In 1994, he left for Fort Lauderdale, Fla. to join the Mr. Food operation -- which includes a web site. cookbooks, product tie-ins and more. He has served as the (mostly) off-air director of the show's test kitchen and cookbook contributor.\nAfter Ginsburg died, Rosenthal became the on-air host of the TV segments, which were renamed \"Mr. Food Test Kitchen.\"\nHoward Rosenthal (left) and the late Art Ginsburg (Mr. Food) on the \"Mr. Food\" set. Kelly Rusin/Mr. Food Test Kitchen\nGinsburg was a butcher in Albany when he started the cooking spots on a local TV station in there in the 1970s. By the 1980s and 1990s, they were in national syndication. Syracuse was one of the original five markets to air the show.\nThe Mr. Food operation outgrew its Albany home in the early 1990s and moved to Florida. That's when Rosenthal -- who had met Ginsburg's daughter in college and later worked with him on some cookbooks -- joined the crew.\nFor those who loved the original \"Mr. Food\" show and Ginsburg's personality, Rosenthal makes it clear: \"I am not Art. I'm not 'Mr. Food.' I'm Howard from the Mr. Food Test Kitchen. There is no replacing Art.\"\nIn the two years he's served as on-air host, Rosenthal has worked on bringing a touch of humor the segments, which also maintain their devotion to simplicity. Rosenthal says he follows Ginsburg's advice, which was to present 90-second segments that were \"doable\" by the average viewer.\nAside from Rosenthal, two other former Central New Yorkers are part of the current incarnation of Mr. Food. They are his wife, Patty Rosenthal, a native of Westvale who develops recipes, and show director Dave Tinsch, who grew up in Syracuse and once served as program director for WTVH.\nFor O'Connor, at Fox68, picking up \"Mr. Food Test Kitchen\" was a no-brainer. He grew up in Albany and watched Ginsburg's \"Mr. Food,\" but only recently learned of the local connection with Rosenthal.\n\"We don't have news programming, so this gives us something different to put on (amid entertainment shows),\" said O'Connor, who added he was surprised that neither Channel 9 or CNYCentral picked it up. \"It was an easy decision to make -- like 10 seconds.\"\nBesides, O'Connor said, the show was pitched by CBS Television Distribution, which supplies Fox68 with some of its most popular shows, like \"Judge Judy,\" \"Jeopardy\" and \"Wheel of Fortune.\"\nAnd the timing couldn't be better: The newest Mr. Food project - due out later this fall -- is a tie-in cookbook with \"Wheel of Fortune,\" which is Fox68's rating leader.\n\"It's the biggest syndicated show in TV,\" Rosenthal said. \"So it's one of the draws of bringing them (Fox68) on board.\"\nMr.Food Test Kitchen has one more Central New York connection: It recently partnered with Utica Cutlery to develop a line of flatware and cutlery under the MFTK brand. The show airs in Utica on WKTV.\nRosenthal is working on an upcoming tour, partly to promote the \"Wheel of Fortune\" book. The tour will take him across Upstate New York, including Syracuse.\n\"It's nice to be back in town (on) TV,\" he said, \"and it's always nice to go back for a visit.\"\nDon Cazentre writes about food, beverages, restaurants and bars for syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
