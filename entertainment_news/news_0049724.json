So, I don’t want to pursue my career anymore as an actor,\" Rimi told IANS over phone before entering the 'Bigg Boss' house from near Lonavla.\nThe actress, who has explored the world of Bollywood as well as the other regional film industries, is one of the 14 contestants of the ninth season of the reality TV show, which is yet again hosted by superstar Salman Khan. The show went on air on Sunday on Colors channel.\nRimi is planning to make the most of her stay aloof from the world in the purpose-built house.\n\"It is just that I’m planning to get into direction by the next year and for directing I need to handle a lot of people, talk to a lot of people which I'm not good at this moment. As I like to interact with very few people. So, maybe my stay in 'Bigg Boss Nau' would be practice match for me,\" the actress said.\nRimi, who has featured in \"Golmaal: Fun Unlimited\", \"Kyon Ki...\" and \"Garam Masala\", notes that she is working on a script with 'someone', but nothing is finalised yet.\nThe reality show, an Indian version of international series \"Celebrity Big Brother\", is known for its notorious qualities like fueling controversies and constants brickbats.\nBefore entering into the house, Rimi noted that she is not at all into controversies, and had mixed feelings about getting locked inside a house for three months under constant camera surveillance.\nThey are without any gadgets and luxury.\nWith the theme \"double trouble\", this season of \"Bigg Boss\" has many TV celebrities like Roopal Tyagi, Ankit Gera, Kishwar Merchant, Aman Verma and Prince.
