Stine is a master of mystery, but his life is -- while not an open book -- the subject of a book.\nHis story is told in \"It Came From Ohio!\" subtitled \"My Life as a Writer,\" by Mr. Stine, as told to Joe Arthur and Susan Lurie. Scholastic Books published it in 1997 and updated it in 2015; it's designed to appeal to fourth- to sixth-graders.\nSome tidbits gleaned from the book, as \"Goosebumps\" opens:\n-- R.L. stands for Robert Lawrence and friends call him Bob.\n-- He was born in Bexley, a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, on Oct. 8, 1943, so he just turned 72.\n-- To the horror of typing teachers everywhere (if such a profession still exists), he is a one-finger typist but a speedy one.\n-- That didn't stop him from writing roughly 330 books, including \"scary ones, joke books, funny books, adventure books, choose-your-own-ending books, and so on,\" he says in answering the 20 most asked questions in the back of \"It Came From Ohio!\"\n-- He was a fearful boy and clearly recalls being panic-stricken and embarrassed at a day camp when he could not jump into a swimming pool as part of a Red Cross badge test. That moment serves him when he writes about a child who is terrified.\n-- As a lover of comic books, he once wanted to draw comics but gravitated toward producing his own magazines and, eventually, writing.\n-- When asked by his parents what he wanted for a bar mitzvah gift, he said a new typewriter. \"They bought me an office-type machine. We're talking a heavy-duty typewriter here. It was perfect. I used that typewriter for years.\"\n-- George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" was one of his favorite horror movies as a boy. So was \"It Came From Beneath the Sea.\"\n-- He wrote the first \"Goosebumps\" book, \"Welcome to Dead House,\" in a little over 10 days. It typically takes six weeks to write a \"Fear Street\" novel, three for \"Goosebumps\" plus a week outlining each book.\n-- Actor Jack Black, who plays a movie version of Stine, told him: \"I'm going to play you as you -- only a lot more sinister.\" That sounded perfect to the man once described by an Ohio newspaper this way: \"In person, R.L. Stine is about as scary as an optometrist.\" You can spot the writer in a cameo, as Mr. Black, near the movie's end.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740253&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740253", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740253&h=Tidbits+about+%27Goosebumps%27+author+R%2EL%2E+Stine"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:25:09.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
