Beaten just one time in 30 matches, they've been the league's best team all season, so the Rhinos believe if they perform to their capabilities like they have almost all season, that'll be good enough to beat the USL's young and hungry road warriors, the Los Angeles Galaxy II. L.A. (17-11-3), the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference, has won three straight road playoff matches.\nThe Eastern Conference champion Rhinos are 19-1-10 and 14-0-2 at home, where they've outscored foes 26-6.\n\"This season it has been more about what we go out and do,\" Rochester forward Colin Rolfe said, \"and I feel if we control what we do — that goes for all 11 guys on the field and everyone on the bench — we've found results.\"\nThey need one more to etch themselves into Rochester soccer history and become the squad that stopped the drought. After winning three A-League crowns and the 1999 U.S. Open Cup title in its first six seasons, one of the USL's most storied franchises has been title-less since 2001. To finally win again in its 20th anniversary season would be special.\n\"It's going to be difficult,\" midfielder Jonny Mendoza said, \"but coach has a plan.\"\nLook for a fast start in Friday's USL Championship match between the Rochester Rhinos and L.A. Galaxy II. Video by Jeff DiVeronica.\nBob Lilley always does and the USL Hall of Fame coach for the Rhinos has been here before. His Hershey club lost the 2001 title match in Rochester, 2-0, then his Vancouver squad beat the Rhinos, 3-0, in their last title shot in 2006 at Sahlen's Stadium. But there's something else in common besides the coach, the venue and one team wearing green and gold. Rochester will be short-handed, just like Vancouver was.\nRochester's top scorer, Steevan Dos Santos (10 goals), is suspended for a red card in Saturday's 1-0 win over Louisville City FC. The 6-foot-4 forward, who scored twice in a 2-0 quarterfinal win over New York, was ejected in the 83rd minute for head-butting a Louisville player. Flash back to 2006. Vancouver was without its offensive catalyst, Eddy Sebrango. He also was suspended for a red card, received for excessively celebrating scoring the decisive goal in an emotional semifinal win over Montreal, one of Sebrango's former clubs along with Rochester.\n\"We've never been about one player,\" Lilley said of the absence of Dos Santos, who missed seven regular-season matches. \"Every time Steevan hasn't played or (rookie forward Christian) Volesky hasn't played someone else has stepped in.\"\nVolesky, the team's second-leading scorer with eight goals, has missed the last few matches after suffering a concussion in practice. He'll sit Friday, too.\n\"You're not going to replace Steevan with one guy,\" Lilley said. \"It changes certain things we'd do, but we've won in so many different ways that there are solutions. There are just different solutions.\"\nNote the word he used: Not strategies, not tactics. His smart and adaptable players have employed different formations and systems to get results. \"We have to do it one more game, but we're confident in this group,\" Lilley said.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nCan Lilley, Rhinos come full circle?\nLilley wouldn't divulge what the lineup will look like without Dos Santos, but Rolfe (six goals) stepped in late in the season when Dos Santos was injured and scored four times in the final five matches. Midfielders Kenardo Forbes (3 goals/5 assists), Tony Walls (4/2), Mendoza (3/2) and Alex Dixon (3/2) are other threats. Then there's forward Asani Samuels (2 goals), a 6-3 rookie out of Canisius College built like Dos Santos.\nMost foes don't worry about the Rochester attack, which finished 12th in the USL (40 goals). L.A. was 13th with 39. Opponents focus on trying to crack a Rhinos defense that matched team records with 17 shutouts and just 15 goals allowed in front of goalie Brandon Miller.\n\"They’re extremely disciplined. They don’t give you a lot of space to play. They’re aggressive. They’re tenacious. They foul you when they need to,\" said Galaxy II coach Curt Onalfo, whose defense allowed 31 goals (third in USL). \"When you go through a season and you only give up 15 goals, you’re doing something right. We know the challenge ahead of us. Having said all that, we’re confident we can break them down and be a team that can cause them issues.\"\nL.A. is owned by the Major League Soccer team by the same name. In their second year of existence, \"Los Dos\" — the team's nickname — can shuffle players up and down from their MLS squad, which is in first place. Lilley said almost all the players he expects to see on Friday have spent time with the MLS Galaxy, which has made a point to keep a few more experienced with Los Dos for the playoffs.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRhinos' task: Stop Roy Lassiter's son\nTwo of the youngest, Jack McBean (age 20) and Ariel Lassiter (21), are top scoring threats. Midfielders Andre Auras (3 goals/4 assists) and Raul Mendiola (4/8) are others. Lassiter had 11 goals in the regular season and three more in the playoffs. McBean (6/5) and Mendiola are among the returnees from last year, when Los Dos knocked the visiting Rhinos from the playoffs, 2-1, in the quarterfinals. They lost in the next round to eventual champion, Sacramento.\nL.A. avenged that with a 1-0 win three weeks ago, then won at Orange County and OKC (Oklahoma City). They led the USL with eight regular-season road wins. Their last 10 matches have been one-goal games.\n\"Experience definitely matters at this point, but I think a lot of our young players do have that even though we are young,\" said Lassiter, the son of former MLS star Roy Lassiter. \"You know, it's a final, so anything can go. The only thing that matters is who is going to fight the hardest for the trophy.\"\nRochester hosts the L.A. Galaxy II in Friday, Oct. 16, night's 2015 USL Championship.
