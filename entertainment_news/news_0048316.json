It’s a question Hugh Jackman, the star of Friday’s PAN , must hear frequently about his decision to quit Wolverine, the steel-clawed X-Men marvel that is his star-making, best known and defining role. “It just feels right,” answered the genial Australian actor who turns 47 Monday. “I’m a big believer in not staying too long at the party. At some point it becomes diminishing returns – for everybody.”\nThe weird thing is his last two outings were easily among the best: the stand alone THE WOLVERINE , the Japanese adventure that seemed to riff on James Bond thrillers, and, he noted, “ X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST might be one of the best X-Men movies ever. The character and the series is in really great shape, it will live on long past me.”\nBut then, WHY exit now? “You know, it just feels really right man. I just had a lovely chat with Jerry Seinfeld – it was the real precipitating factor. I was asking him about ‘When did you know it was the end?’ and he said, ‘I’m a big believer in that you need to leave something in the tank. You need to leave creatively like you’ve got a little bit left. Because that feeds into your next project.’ I thought that was really insightful. Of course things are still going well with the series, it’s still relevant and current and we have an option to do something really special with this last one. Then,” he added cheerfully, “I feel that’s probably it.”\nWhen will we see that farewell turn? “Once we get the script right, we’re going to film it,” he answered, which means spring 2017.\nCharming disarming ‘Doc’\nMartin Clunes’ grouchy but adorable DOC MARTIN has now hit SERIES 7 with the exclusive US premiere of the season’s eight new episodes available Monday nights in October on Acorn.TV. After Nov. 16 the complete series -- 1 thru 7 -- becomes available any time on Acorn.TV. I must confess having never seen the DOC previously I came to SERIES 7 entirely due to Clunes’ exemplary work as a charming, big-hearted Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in PBS’ recent ARTHUR & GEORGE where as Sherlock Holmes’ creator he actually solved a real-life series of crimes and had a wrongly convicted barrister George Edalji (Arsher Ali) exonerated. A true story, Sir Arthur was assisted with the help of his skeptical assistant Alfred Wood (Charles Edwards). As Doc Martin Clunes, like Doyle, is emotionally adjusting to the end of a marriage. In Doyle’s case his wife had died while for Doc Martin his wife has abandoned him in his little seaside (fictional) village of Portwenn, filmed on North Cornwall’s picturesque coast. A low-key comedy with a revolving cast that includes the great Dame Eileen Atkins as Aunt Ruth and Jessica Ransom as Morwenna, the Doc’s receptionist, DOC MARTIN is addictive in its charms and never too preachy in its emphasis that we are all, if we’re lucky enough, connected, that it takes a village to make a robust life.\nGuess whose ‘Zipper’\nEver since Patrick Wilson was strapped down and threatened with castration by an avenging Ellen Page in the 2005 HARD CANDY the lanky Virginian has often played the sexual stud, most memorably opposite Kate Winslet as an adulterous couple in LITTLE CHILDREN (2006). In the intense and compelling ZIPPER (Blu-ray, Alchemy, R for strong sexual content, language and discreet nudity) Wilson has a great role as a politico, a federal prosecutor in fact, on the high road to DC via influential backers like Richard Dreyfuss and Ray Winstone’s bulldog reporter. Only despite a successful 13 year marriage to Lena Heady and an all-American adolescent son, Wilson’s Sam Ellis, like Eliot Spitzer, just can’t resist the high end escort service that lets him bed one nubile and very willing fantasy woman after another. ZIPPER , directed with sharp nuance by co-writer Mora Stephens, captures this escort service virgin’s nervous initiation into the delights of the flesh in an anonymous hotel room and expertly dramatizes how easily these women can make a client come back for more, again and again. ZIPPER does wonder why we hold public servants, elected officials to a higher standard and indulge in the fantasy that they are somehow, and against all common sense, better than us. And as it wonders it sticks the knife into those assumptions and gradually twists it.
