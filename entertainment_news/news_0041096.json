Benett / Getty Images ​Mila Kunis sat down for an amusing interview with Business Insider recently, and as is often the case in polite conversation, the topic of her child — she and Ashton Kutcher are parents to 1-year-old Wyatt Isabelle — growing up to be a murderer came up. It's either that or talking about the weather, am I right?!\nIt's a subject Mila had clearly mulled over already, though she doesn't clarify whether it's just because she's as obsessed with How to Get Away With Murder as the rest of us or, you know, because of darker moments in the Kunis-Kutcher household. \"I think if [Wyatt] killed someone, I would literally be like 'I got it,'\" she told Insider ; after all, the name does bring to mind Wild West-style gunslingers. \"Where do you want me to help you hide the body?\" she continued, as though she were talking right to her daughter standing there with the smoking gun or bloodied hatchet, and \"I wouldn't even question it.\"\n\"I couldn't say that about anybody else in my life,\" Mila said, and so on that note, Ashton will just have to put his crime spree dreams to bed for good, unless he's prepared to go solo. Lil' Wyatt is, of course, already sleeping peacefully and let's not even worry what she's dreaming about.
