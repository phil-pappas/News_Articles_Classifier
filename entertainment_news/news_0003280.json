TMZ shared that last night, Kendra Wilkinson was seen out at a sexy Halloween party, but it wasn’t the Playboy party she chose to attend. Instead, Kendra, dressed with blue hair in a sexy skeleton costume, actually went to the Maxim party just down the street. It was the same night as the Playboy party, and now everyone is wondering why she did not attend it. \nThis season on Kendra On Top , Hank and Kendra did go to the Midsummer Night’s Dream party, and they took Kendra’s father and new fiancée along with them. Her dad’s fiancée ended up getting into some trouble with the law, and Hank had to go give her dad a ride home. Kendra has been seen more than once at the Playboy mansion and with Hef on the show, so the fact that she would miss the Playboy party just doesn’t make a lot of sense to anyone. \nKendra Wilkinson also showed up to the party without Hank Baskett on her arm. The reason wasn’t explained, and could have been as simple as Hank decided to stay home with the kids, but nobody knows. Kendra shared a photo on her Instagram, showing her with a girlfriend and not husband Hank Baskett. A photo posted by @kendra_wilkinson_baskett on Oct 25, 2015 at 3:14am PDT \nThis is actually causing the divorce rumors between Hank and Kendra to heat up. On Kendra On Top , it has been very obvious that they are having a few problems, but everyone has wanted to see them work it out. It has been a rough year for Kendra and Hank. Hollywood Life shared that the rumors are heating up that the transgender scandal might have finally been enough for these two. That was a very hard time for them, and it looks like Kendra might finally be moving on. An insider actually spoke out about what is really going on with Kendra and Hank. \n“[Kendra] goes in and out with this. The story is definitely exaggerated and they certainly have their ups and downs. But in the long run, she is and has been most concerned about the well-being of their kids and that is what has kept them together this long.” \nThis all comes after In Touch shared that Kendra Wilkinson was done with Hank and ready to divorce him. They have obviously have their issues, but divorce or a split has never actually happened. They recently shared details from another insider. \n“Kendra told Hank she wants a divorce because she can’t stand to look at him anymore,She’s going to leave him. Kendra is done. Kendra rants every day on the set of her show about how she hates Hank and how desperate she is to get rid of him.” \nIt is hard to know which side of the Hank Baskett and Kendra Wilkinson story is true. At this time, the two are still showing a united front and making it look like everything is just fine between them. Kendra Wilkinson recently shared a photo of the two together on Instagram, and it did appear that everything was just fine between them. \nhttp://instagram.com/p/9PFqbUFbfj \nDo you think that Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett are going to end up getting divorced? Does Kendra have a reason for not attending the Playboy party that is more than just choosing another one? Hopefully, everything is just fine for Wilkinson, regardless of what things look like right now. Sound off in the comments below on your thoughts on Kendra and Hank.
