That the two of them came together as the guitar/cello duo Tall Heights happened by choice and by chance. \n“He was really good friends with my older brother,” Harrington says. “We didn’t really become friends for a long time because Paul was two years older than me. When you’re that age, two years is a big gap and you have to be cool and keep your distance from the youngsters. We went to the same high school and both sang in the choir.” \nAfter graduating from different colleges, Harrington’s and Wright’s paths converged again in Boston, where they formed Tall Heights in 2010. \n“The first time we performed together was in my band,” Harrington says. “I just wanted a cello. That he could play the cello did initiate our first collaboration. But, at the same time, we would drive to school together every single day for four years. We were both aware of what the other one was doing in those years. We both had a lot of respect for one another and our paths were so intertwined.” \nAlthough Harrington envisioned the cello as part of the indie folk sound he wanted to create, Wright would probably still be half of the Tall Heights duo even if he played another instrument. \n“I think it was an eventuality that we would start playing together,” Harrington says. “I guess if he was an accordion player, there would be a good chance that we would be a guitar/accordion duo.” \nHarrington and Wright got their chops by busking at Boston’s Faneuil Hall. \n“We have a hard time thinking of ways that it didn’t benefit our music,” Harrington says. “We played hundreds and hundreds of hours over the course of summer 2010. It was the summer where we really dedicated ourselves to learning how to be songwriters and learning how to sing, play and perform. We would do these four-hour street performing shifts and then go back to our apartment and practice. Then, we would do it again the next day. It was tons and tons of hours of experience in a very concentrated period of time.” \nPerforming on the street taught Harrington and Wright how to grab people’s attention with just two instruments and the harmonious blend of their voices, often compared to Simon & Garfunkel and Bon Iver. \n“I attribute it to being hardened on the streets by making some good music and making some bad music and trying things and failing and trying things and succeeding,” Harrington says. “We learned to sync into what we were doing and how to affect people that are just passing by. We learned that there is a lot that you can do with just a little amount of sound, with just a little specific attention to some details. We learned that by just doing it a whole lot on the street.” \nTall Heights has released two EPs — 2011’s “Rafters” and 2012’s “The Running of the Bulls” — and the debut 2013 full-length album “Man of Stone,” all recorded as a duo. \nThe group has expanded their sound on the new EP “Holding On, Holding Out,” dropped on Oct. 9. \nInfluenced by Icelandic bands Sigur Rós and Ásgeir, as well as Canadian singer-songwriter Feist and the Swedish indie folk group First Aid Kit, Tall Heights incorporates electronics, synthesizers, drum loops and Casio keyboards into their sonic blueprint. \n“It is a larger sound,” Harrington says. “The heart and soul of it is the same kind of songwriting and same kind of songs. We focused on doing what we have always done — harmonies, cello and guitar — but allowed the vision to lead us. Our last album we recorded ourselves in my apartment. We tried to maximize what we could do with two voices and two instruments. Whereas, this one, we trapped ourselves in a little box and decided to make noises with what we had, but we had a lot more stuff.” \nTo get the full experience of the new EP, Tall Heights is playing several shows with a 25-piece orchestra, but, unfortunately, not at their show at Ignition Music Garage in Goshen on Thursday. \n“For our live presentation, we are free to add and subtract different elements,” Harrington says. “It depends on logistical things, like how far away it is and how hard it will be to get the whole band out there. For this tour, we are playing with a drummer and an auxiliary performer, and an orchestra on a few of the shows. We’re not planning on adding an orchestra full time, but we certainly love the guys we are playing with and we would love to keep them around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:19:22.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
