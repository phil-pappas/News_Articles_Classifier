Imagine if Marty McFly and Doc Brown actually saw the real 2015? Well imagine no more as the two time-travelling adventurers turned up on Jimmy Kimmel last night (October 21).As part of Back to the Future Day, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd appeared as their iconic characters, and were not exactly impressed by what they saw - namely selfies, cronuts and a lack of flying cars.Back to the Future Day October 21, 2015: A definitive guide to hoverboards, Chicago Cubs and Jaws 19\"People are watching this on TV right now,\" Kimmel revealed to them as they emerged from the DeLorean. \"Although honestly most people will probably be watching this on their phones on the toilet tomorrow.\"\"That's gross,\" Fox's McFly responded, also asking to no greater success: \"Did you achieve peace in the Middle East?\" © ABC Kimmel showed the pair the smartphone, explaining \"we mainly use them to send little smiley faces to each another\", and took the opportunity for a selfie with the bemused duo.The host also joked that the villainous Biff from the movies is now his stage manager. After McFly noted that Biff became a rich casino owner and ruined the world, Kimmel said that he is running for President now - a not so subtle dig at Donald Trump.Doc Brown concluded that human evolution had stopped in this \"alternate\" 2015 and eventually left the stage to even more rapturous applause. © ABC The sketch also saw an appearance from Huey Lewis of Back to the Future anthem 'The Power of Love' fame.Back to the Future Day saw a host of events, including a tweet by President Obama to Fox, USA Today reprinting the film's mock-front page and Marty's hoverboard coming to life, as well as real Nike self-lacing shoes.Check out what Back to the Future got right - and wrong - about 2015 below: function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4567984035001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14567984035001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4567984035001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4567984035001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14567984035001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4567984035001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; }", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:59:04.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
