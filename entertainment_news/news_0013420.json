At a young age sitting at her grandmother’s kitchen table, Showers began her artistic endeavors. In her early years, Showers struggled with an eating disorder and found her way through the healing process by creating intricately beaded jewelry for those who were instrumental in her recovery. Her powerful experience with creativity set Showers on a path to offer her talents to help empower women. “I want to create pieces that inspire a woman’s self-confidence and make her feel beautiful inside and out,” Showers said.\nShe studied at the Gemological Institute of America in California and has traveled the world finding inspiration for her jewelry designs amidst the exotic cultures of Africa, Thailand and the Far East.\nHer designs range from simple silver and gold pieces as in the Tree of Life collection to the intricate Decoder collection comprising gold, silver, diamonds and a selection of precious and semi-precious gem stones such as malachite, blue sapphire and turquoise.\nSorrel Sky Gallery owner, Shanan Campbell Wells, offered, “Elizabeth brings such joy and passion to her designs. Through her jewelry, she reminds women of their strength, femininity and beauty.”\nSorrel Sky Gallery’s fresh approach to Western art presents a select collection of contemporary and traditional fine art and jewelry for the discerning collector. Sorrel Sky Gallery was founded in Durango, CO in 2002 and opened its Santa Fe, NM location in 2013. It represents over 75 painters, sculptors and jewelers including bronze artist Star Liana York, painter Billy Schenck, and former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse, among others.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13006965.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://sorrelsky.com/artist/elizabeth-showers", "https://sorrelsky.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13006965.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:36:41.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
