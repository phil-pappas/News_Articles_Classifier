This has been Brooks’ mantra since she took office in 2004.\n“I think there are people that truly appreciate what a daunting task that is in today’s economic environment,” she said in a recent interview.\nBrooks’ political opponents and other critics take a very different view of her legacy.\nThey recall a list of scandals like the local development corporation case, which is still crawling its way through state Supreme Court. Brooks’ husband, Robert Wiesner, is a defendant and faces a single charge of bid-rigging.\nCounty Democrats also have pointed to a report from state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli — also a Democrat — that recently named this the most fiscally stressed county in New York. They place the blame largely on Brooks.\n“In a sense, I pity whoever is elected county executive,” said Paul Haney, a term-limited Democratic county lawmaker who has been one of Brooks’ toughest critics on financial matters. “This is a house of cards that is going to collapse.”\nThe Nov. 3 election for county executive may hinge in part on which version of Brooks voters accept: A leader who put taxpayers first, one plagued by scandals and mismanagement, or one whose record is too nuanced to sum up in simple terms.\nVoters may recall yet a different version of Brooks entirely — a former television news personality who seemed to enjoy connecting with people and was a constant presence at community events, ribbon-cuttings and press conferences. Her office estimated that she has handed out some 2,500 proclamations to people in the community over the years.\n“People have liked her. Why have they liked her? They regard her almost as an extended member of the family,” said Curt Smith, a former speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, an author and senior lecturer in English at the University of Rochester.\nIf voters approve of what Brooks has done overall, they may see reason to stay the course with nearly 25 years of GOP leadership by electing Republican Cheryl Dinolfo.\nDissatisfied voters could see reason to change direction with Democrat Sandra Frankel or Green Party candidate Rajesh Barnabas.\nThe winner will take over the job of managing a government with a roughly $1 billion annual budget, the authority to charge property taxes and an array of agencies that oversee economic development, public health and social services, among other responsibilities.\nWhatever Brooks does next, it seems likely she will pop up elsewhere in public life, said Jaime Saunders, CEO at Willow Domestic Violence Center. Brooks served on its board from 1997 to 2003, when it was called Alternatives for Battered Women, and Saunders spoke highly of Brooks’ support over the years.\n“I think that it’s not goodbye,” Saunders said. “It’s what will the next chapter be?”\nAnother run: ‘Not a priority’\nBefore considering Brooks’ legacy, it’s worth remembering how she entered the public sphere and where she may be headed next.\nBrooks began her career in 1977 as a radio reporter for WHAM-AM (1180). She moved in 1980 to WHEC-TV (Channel 10) as an anchorwoman and reporter. She said she was downsized in 1994 and went to work in private satellite radio programming for nursing homes.\nShe dabbled in helping Irondequoit Republicans with media before running for election as a county legislator and winning in 1995. Brooks said while she enjoyed working with the public in both roles, she hadn’t planned on going into politics full time.\nBut when opportunities came along, she seized them.\nTwo years later, Gov. George Pataki appointed Brooks county clerk to fill a vacancy. Voters elected her to the job in 1997 and 2001.\nFrom that launching pad, Brooks defeated Democratic Mayor William A. Johnson Jr. in 2003 in a hard-fought race to succeed GOP County Executive Jack Doyle.\nSince then, Brooks has faced only one Democratic challenger for the job: Frankel, who ran and lost in 2011. The following year, Brooks fought to unseat longtime U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-Fairport, but lost with about 43 percent of the vote.\nWhen she entered office, Brooks said she already was used to being recognized in restaurants and grocery stores. But public office brought a more intense level of scrutiny.\n“There are moments when you just wish you could fade into the woodwork or fade into the background,” she said. “But for the most part, the reason I love the media, the reason that I love government, is I love people, and I love interacting with this community.”\nBrooks, 60, is mum on where she’s headed next, but she isn’t retiring. On top of her current job, she’s teaching a class called “Power, Influence and Negotiation” at the Saunders College of Business at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\nShe brushed off rumors that she’s eyeing the CEO position at the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority, noting that it’s occupied by Bill Carpenter, and said she’s talking to people about roles in both the private and public sectors.\nAnother political race isn’t in her immediate plans.\n“I will never say never, but it’s not a priority for me at this point,\" Brooks said.\n‘The sky is not falling’\nFrom the start, Brooks ran on a vow to hold down property taxes.\nShe said she’s lived up to her promise: The property tax rate is $8.99 per $1,000 in assessed value, down from $9.10 when she took office.\nWhile that is true, Brooks took heat when other charges on the tax bill rose, including a fee established in 2013 to help pay for snow and ice removal on suburban roads and a chargeback used to help fund Monroe Community College.\nDemocrats have used decisions like this to criticize Brooks for balancing a tight budget with what they view as short-sighted or disingenuous financial gimmicks, such as land sales and deferring the county’s contributions to the pension system.\nBut Brooks said she’s saved money by pursuing efficiency and forging public-private partnerships in the face of costs that are mandated, but often not funded, by the state. She said all but 15 percent of spending in the county budget is now driven by mandates, though it remains unclear how exactly her administration arrived at this number, and Democrats say most other counties seem to handle the same problem more effectively.\nBrooks said her critics have one aim in mind.\n“Simply put, the Comptroller’s Office wants us to raise taxes. Wall Street wants us to raise taxes when they challenge us through a credit rating,” she said. “We’ve refused to do that, and I know that annoys those entities. I know that it frustrates the political opposition locally.\n“The sky is not falling.”\nShe said her cost-saving measures have paid off over time, including job consolidations across several departments and a shift to self-insurance for employees' health benefits. Other decisions lifted costs from smaller governments, Brooks said, such as the expansion of the city and county 911 Center and a county-wide training facility for emergency responders.\n“When you strip away the politics and the public part of what I do, I am the CEO of a billion-dollar company with 4,500 employees,” Brooks said. “Every day when I walk through that door, that’s how I try and behave — as the leader of a large company which at the end of the day will have a huge impact on the condition of our county and the quality of life of our community.”\nWhile Brooks said she’s managed to stave off draconian cuts, critics have questioned some of her financial priorities. Under her tenure, for example, the county has trimmed funding for subsidies for low-income working parents to put their kids in day care. Brooks argues the state must do more to help with this expense.\nAdvocates are planning a rally Tuesday outside the County Office Building to call for more child care money.\n‘Cronyism and corruption’\nBrooks also sometimes came under fire for hires and appointments that some viewed as politically driven, including jobs at the Monroe County Water Authority.\nIn late 2013 came a criminal case alleging that four men — including Wiesner, Brooks' husband and the former security director at the Water Authority — steered contracts for a pair of major county technology projects to bidders with connections to county government.\nThe case brought by Democratic state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman hinges on the use of local development corporations, or LDCs — nonprofit entities created by county government to finance the projects. Republicans have claimed the case is politically motivated.\nThere were scandals before that, too.\nThere was the Robutrad case, in which trades workers were accused of doing jobs for friends, family and politically connected people while on the clock for the county. Public officials, however, were cleared of wrongdoing, and Brooks herself helped bring the episode to light.\nThere also were two directors of the county-run airport who resigned in a row – one because of the revelation that he charged thousands of dollars of cigars as a business expense, and another after her drunken driving arrest.\nBrooks said when people have made bad decisions, she’s dealt with them appropriately, and on the whole, she's assembled a strong team of leaders.\nBut episodes like this gave Frankel fuel to complain last month of a culture of \"cronyism and corruption\" in county government.\nBoth she and her GOP opponent, Dinolfo, have pledged to establish a county Office of Public Integrity to deal with ethics issues, and to either eliminate or phase out the LDCs.\n'Unfair criticism'\nBrooks said claims that her administration has favored political allies are without merit. She said both parties support people on their own teams.\nShe noted that her administration set up a whistleblower hotline to deal with complaints and said her administration has, in fact, operated \"ethically and effectively.\" Claims otherwise are unfair election-year criticism, she said.\n“I’ve been re-elected now five times by a wide majority of voters in Monroe County,” she said. “That’s the accountability that I look for.”\nAs for the LDC case, Brooks said she has focused on ensuring that taxpayers got what they paid for. The LDCs were a funding mechanism that allowed the county to carry out projects it otherwise could not have afforded, she said.\nBrooks said the matter is now in the hands of the court, and her involvement is done.\nAs for her husband’s role as a defendant, “I am the county executive, and I have dealt with this as the county executive,\" Brooks said. \"He is not a county employee.”\nBrooks argued that voters are more interested in whether there are jobs and taxes are stable. She said that under her tenure, the county helped to create or retain 110,000 jobs, in large part through the tax incentives delivered through the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency.\nCOMIDA, too, has been criticized for too readily handing out tax breaks while asking for too little in return. But Brooks said the county has received a 4-to-1 return on its investments under her tenure.\n“It’s become sport to focus on the failures — Medley Centre, whatever,” she said. “But I think the landscape is full of success stories, and it’s hard to get that word and that part of the story told. But it’s a big part of the story.”\nWhat will people remember?\nBrooks said she does not dwell on regrets.\nFor the next few months, Brooks said she is focused instead on what she still has to get done — submitting a final budget that will not raise property taxes, seeing through an expansion of Mill Seat landfill, working with the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative. The results of this work will be a part of her legacy.\nSmith, the former speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, credited Brooks’ approach to taxes, but said it’s hard to know now how people may remember her. While the county executive has limited influence over jobs, the economy usually trumps most concerns, he said. The ultimate success or failure of jobs projects like AIM Photonics may shape how citizens remember Brooks, he said.\n“We don’t know the legacy, because we don’t know to what extent the economic endeavors that have begun late in her term will come to fruition,” Smith said.\nJames R. Bowers, chairman of the department of political science and legal studies at St. John Fisher College, said people don’t tend to remember local officials in the long-term unless they were unusual characters. Brooks was usually a good communicator and a likable figure, but not a character, he said.\nThat's a good thing, he said.\n“We can have too many characters,” said Bowers, a former city school board member who once ran for City Council. “It almost might be better to have served your time in office and then go on and not be remembered.”\nWhatever comes next, Brooks has no apparent plans to slow down.\n\"I’m not unlike other people that have a mortgage and bills to pay, and I’m 60 years old,\" she said. \"I really want to work some additional time.”\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nSix of Brooks' greatest hits\nLove them or hate them, Monroe County Executive Maggie Brooks' major initiatives rarely failed to make headlines over the past 12 years.\nHere's a look at six highlights of big projects during her three terms.\nRenaissance Square. Brooks championed a massive plan to redevelop a block of East Main Street with a performing arts center, a new campus for Monroe Community College and a bus terminal. The project won federal backing, but fell apart in 2009 as county and city officials scuffled over the details. Brooks recently pointed out that pieces of the project advanced anyway: MCC is constructing a new campus at former Eastman Kodak Co. offices on State Street, the Downtown Transit Center opened last year and the city is reconsidering a downtown arts center.\nThe F.A.I.R. plan. In 2007, Brooks pushed through legislation to close a budget gap by intercepting sales tax money that normally went to suburban school districts. She called it the Fairness, Accountability, Innovation and Results plan. Outraged districts sued. The county ultimately settled with them, dropping the plan and agreeing to pay back $29 million. Part of the plan known as a Medicaid swap remained in place; Brooks estimates that it saved taxpayers $30 million.\nShiny new facilities. Under Brooks’ watch, the county built or expanded several facilities, including a new exhibit area for elephants at the county-owned Seneca Park Zoo; a $23 million downtown crime laboratory, completed under budget in 2011; and a $9.5 million power plant that burns methane produced by trash at Mill Seat landfill in Riga. Work also began on a $72 million new campus for MCC in High Falls; the county will foot about half the bill.\nLDC projects. Hundreds of millions of dollars went into upgrading county technology during Brooks’ tenure, including new phone and computers, and communications systems for police and firefighters. The county set up local development corporations, or LDCs, to finance these projects. Four men are now accused of abusing these arcane entities to steer contracts to politically-connected bidders. Brooks maintains the county could not have afforded these projects without the LDCs.\nTax breaks. It wasn't part of a single initiative, but the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency has made tax incentives a priority under Brooks' tenure. COMIDA handed out about $231 million in incentives to companies and developers over the past 10 years, according to Brooks' office. She argues that this produced a 4-to-1 return on investment for the community, but critics say COMIDA has too readily given builders tax breaks while asking for too little in return.\nMonroe200. Late in her tenure, Brooks focused on trying to find ways to attract young adults to Monroe County. She convened a group of 200 young people to discuss what would keep them here. The group produced a report this year that emphasized that young people need job opportunities.\nA woman in power\nIn 2003, Monroe County voters stood to make history no matter whom they elected Monroe County executive.\nRochester Mayor William A. Johnson Jr., a Democrat, could have been the first African-American to hold the job. As it turned out, Republican Maggie Brooks became the first woman to occupy the county’s top elected office.\n“There was a little history pushing both of us,” she said recently.\nBrooks said she didn’t run because she wanted to smash the glass ceiling, but the significance of being the first woman in the job wasn’t lost on her.\n“I think sometimes women put a different type of personal pressure on themselves because they’re women,” she said. “You don’t want to be the first female county executive and fail and have people say you failed because you’re a woman.”\nIn the 1990s, when Brooks considered going into politics full-time, she had two young daughters, Julia and Jensen. That weighed on her decision, she said.\n“As a mom with young children, how many concerts do you want to miss? How many nights at home do you want to miss?” she said.\n“But it was the right move for me at the time.”\nAs she went door to door campaigning for a County Legislature seat in 1995, Brooks said she encountered two common reactions. The first was surprise that after a career in journalism, she was choosing a political side.\nThe other: “Oh. You’re a woman and a Republican.”\n“It kind of took me by surprise,” Brooks said. “From a public consumption perspective, suddenly they align you with certain values and issues that maybe you’re not even aware of.”\nUltimately, Brooks said she did not feel treated any differently as a woman in a position of leadership. People have tended to respect her position, she said.\nBrooks noted there are many more women in local leadership positions today than when she was first elected, including Mayor Lovely Warren. Brooks said she was able to work with all the mayors during her tenure, but she has particularly good communication with Warren.\n“We tend to be at the same tables a lot more often than maybe I was with other mayors, just because we’re all working on the same priorities at this point,” Brooks said.\nDRILEY@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/246319aaf2b45784bb363dd9c5bc6a865ed66f21/c=0-645-2000-2354/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Rochester/Rochester/635794899617962657-LP-maggie-brooks-C-100215-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06f652dd16c926e76b32b6efbb0e253eb14dc92e/c=330-0-2670-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Rochester/Rochester/635794898244217851-LP-maggie-brooks-B-100215-Metro.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-11T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:08:22.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
