The tour will hit nearly 50 cities across the U.S., including stops in New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville. See below for full tour itinerary. MURS is joined on the Have A Nice Life Tour by Red Pill and King Fantastic. \n\nMURS has recorded a string of revered collaborative albums with Fashawn, 9th Wonder, and Slug of Atmosphere (as Felt). He’s also the owner and founder of the groundbreaking Paid Dues Festival, which highlights the best underground rap on the planet. Having been both an independent artist and signed to a major label, MURS learned the benefits of going indie, and signed with Tech N9ne’s label Strange Music in early 2014. Later that year, he released a collaborative album, ¡MursDay! , with hip hop band and fellow Strange Music signees, ¡MAYDAY!. The collective was excited to work together and create an album that captured the energy both parties always provide when performing live. In May of this year, MURS released his first solo album on the indie imprint, Have A Nice Life , to critical acclaim. The album showcases MURS’ prolific storytelling abilities, and brought a new sound to his music with production by MURS’ childhood friend, Jesse Shatkin (Sia, Kelly Clarkson). \nDon’t miss your chance to see underground icon MURS live! \n\nHave A Nice Life Tour Itinerary: \n09.18.15 HONOLULU, HI THE REPUBLIK \n09.19.15 HILO, HI HILO TOWN TAVERN \n09.30.15 SAN DIEGO, CA THE CASBAH \n10.01.15 LAS VEGAS, NV BACKSTAGE BAR \n10.02.15 INDIO, CA THE DATE SHED \n10.03.15 FRESNO, CA STRUMMER’S \n10.04.15 BAKERSFIELD, CA B RYDER’S \n10.05.15 SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA SLO BREW \n10.07.15 SANTA CRUZ, CA THE CATALYST ATRIUM \n10.08.15 SAN FRANCISCO, CA SLIM’S \n10.09.15 PORTLAND, OR HAWTHORNE THEATER \n10.10.15 BELLINGHAM, WA WILD BUFFALO \n10.11.15 SEATTLE, WA THE CROCODILE \n10.13.15 BOISE, ID NEUROLUX \n10.14.15 MISSOULA, MT PALACE LOUNGE \n10.15.15 JACKSON HOLE, WY TOWN SQUARE TAVERN \n10.16.15 BOULDER, CO FOX THEATRE \n10.18.15 ASPEN, CO BELLY UP TAVERN \n10.19.15 SALT LAKE CITY, UT URBAN LOUNGE \n10.23.15 DALLAS, TX CLUB DADA \n10.24.15 AUSTIN, TX STUBB’S JR. \n10.25.15 SAN ANTONIO, TX PAPER TIGER \n10.27.15 NEW ORLEANS, LA THE PARISH AT HOUSE OF BLUES \n10.29.15 NASHVILLE, TN THE HIGH WATT \n10.30.15 ATLANTA, GA AISLE 5 \n10.31.15 ORLANDO, FL THE BACKBOOTH \n11.01.15 TAMPA, FL THE CROWBAR \n11.02.15 MIAMI, FL GRAMPS \n11.04.15 WEST COLUMBIA, SC NEW BROOKLYN TAVERN \n11.05.15 CARRBORO, NC CAT’S CRADLE – BACK ROOM \n11.06.15 WASHINGTON, DC U STREET MUSIC HALL \n11.07.15 NEW YORK, NY THE STUDIO AT WEBSTER HALL \n11.08.15 CAMBRIDGE, MA THE MIDDLE EAST UPSTAIRS \n11.11.15 MADISON, WI MAJESTIC THEATRE \n11.12.15 COLUMBUS, OH THE BASEMENT \n11.13.15 CHICAGO, IL SUBTERRANEAN \n11.14.15 COLUMBIA, MI ROSE MUSIC HALL \n11.15.15 OMAHA, NE THE WAITING ROOM \n11.16.15 LAWRENCE, KS GRANADA THEATRE \n11.17.15 TULSA, OK THE VANGUARD \n11.19.15 ALBUQUERQUE, NM LAUNCHPAD \n11.20.15 FLAGSTAFF, AZ THE GREEN ROOM \n11.21.15 PHOENIX, AZ THE CRESCENT BALLROOM \n11.22.15 TUCSON, AZ CLUB CONGRESS \n11.27.15 ANAHEIM, CA HOUSE OF BLUES \n12.26.15 LOS ANGELES, CA THE FONDA THEATRE \nRelated", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:25:05.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
