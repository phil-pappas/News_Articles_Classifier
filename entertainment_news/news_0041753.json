Every day, more and more food news is cooking in the area. A weekly feature, “Leftovers” is a roundup of the latest on the local food and restaurant scene. Shucks! eyeing early November opening \nA restaurant that has made a name for itself selling fresh seafood and Gulf oysters will land in Baton Rouge by next month, if all goes according to plan. David Bertrand, co-owner of Shucks!, says the Capital City iteration of the restaurant could be in its soft opening phase by the first or second week of November. Bertrand and his business partner Bert Istre entered a partnership with Baton Rouge restaurateur Wayne Stabiler to bring Shucks! into the location of the former Le Creolé at 18135 E. Petroleum Drive. \nShucks! will feature a scaled down menu of “authentically Cajun” seafood dishes. The goal is to grow the concept beyond Baton Rouge and Abbeville and into markets such as Lake Charles. \n“We love the location [in Baton Rouge], and Wayne [Stabiler] didn’t have a casual family restaurant in his repertoire,” Bertrand said. “We feel there isn’t another place in the area that focuses on oysters like we do.” \nFor more information, visit shucksrestaurant.com . Marina’s Mexican Grill to open new location \nPerkins Road will have a new Mexican restaurant as soon as next month. Marina’s Mexican Grill is set to open in its new location at 6251 Perkins Road, the former location of the short-lived Souga Pizza Factory, in November. \nOwner Pierre Barousalian said the restaurant will feature fajitas, quesadillas, guacamole salads and other dishes made from scratch. Marina’s was formerly located off Bennington Avenue, but has been closed for a year now. Barousalian said the suite next door, which used to be Urban Nine skate shop, will also be a part of the restaurant. The adjacent suite will be used to host private parties and for catering. Marina’s will be open seven days a week. Firm business hours and a grand opening date have not been set. \nFor more information, visit facebook.com/marinas-mexican-grill .
