On the Sunday before its final episode, PBS will air a marathon of the season up to that point and a behind-the-scenes program on how the show was made. \nThe network will also try to use \"Downton Abbey\" as a launching pad for \"Mercy Street,\" a Civil War drama premiering Jan. 17 directly after an episode of the outgoing hit. \nPBS also has a new two-part Ken Burns documentary on Jackie Robinson that will premiere in April to coincide with the start of a new baseball season. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:21:23.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
