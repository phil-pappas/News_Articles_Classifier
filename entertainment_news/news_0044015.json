After all, the Straight Outta Compton movie did so well, there's already a sequel in the works .\nThe top vote-getters will be announced in December and inducted next April at a ceremony in New York City. HBO will broadcast the glitzy event later in the year. To be eligible for the 2016 Hall of Fame class, artists must have released their first single or album in 1990 or earlier.\nLast year's Hall of Fame inductees included Lou Reed, Green Day, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble and Ringo Starr.", "external_links": ["http://www.tmz.com/2015/09/08/straight-outta-compton-2-cast-suge-dr-dre-daz/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:11:14.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
