(Photo: The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon) \n\"The first one, my cat Hudson, he was playing with the string and then it ripped off some of the tape, and he discovered tape, and then it ripped off the whole thing,\" Burton explained to Fallon. \nThe back scratcher is placed on the head and a hairbrush attached to a string goes down your shirt. When you pull the front string, it scratches your back. \n8-year-old Andrew Burton from Littleton and Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon demonstrate the Back Scratcher 2.0. (Photo: The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon) \n\"My mom was having trouble scratching her back because we went to my grandma's house in Arkansas,\" Burton said. \"A couple days ago - before that happened - I learned about levers in school, so I invented the Back Scratcher 2.0.\" \nFallon called the invention \"fantastic.\" \nTonight Show host Jimmy Fallon giggles as he uses the Back Scratcher 2.0.
