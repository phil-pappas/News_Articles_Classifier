He and Elton spoke on the phone and the Kremlin have confirmed that. \n\"Now they're trying to get a date in the diary to talk face to face. That may surprise people but I take people as I find them and he was so polite and lovely on the phone. \n\"He's genuinely lovely. Besides, this isn't about politics -I'm not a politician - it's about humanity.\" \nPresenters Vladimir Krasnov and Aleksei Stolyarov managed to fool Elton in a phone call in which the 68-year-old singer agreed to attend a gay pride parade in Moscow and spoke of his concern about violence in Russia towards members LGBT community. \nHe also asked for a face-to-face meeting with the president, whose country has long been blasted for its treatment of homosexuals. \nAfterwards he took to Instagram to post a picture of Putin and wrote: \"Thank-you to President Vladimir Putin for reaching out and speaking via telephone with me today. I look to forward to meeting with you face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia.\" \nHowever, the pranksters confirmed it was a hoax and aired a recording of the conversation on state TV, before publishing it on YouTube. \nAfter the call was revealed to be fake, Elton wrote on Instagram: \"Pranks are funny. Homophobia, however, is never funny. If this unfortunate incident has helped push this vital issue back into the spotlight I'm happy to be pranked.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:28:50.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
