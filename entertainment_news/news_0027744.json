Photo: Getty Images \nThere was an obvious story to tell about Orson Welles this year and many have dutifully told it. Yes, it's 100 years since the legendary American actor and film director was born. As an artist, the man who directed such acclaimed movies as Citizen Kane , The Magnificent Ambersons , Touch Of Evil , and F for Fake remains an evergreen, his films imperishable jewels of Western culture.\nBut there's a more interesting angle from which to consider this enigmatic 20th-century figure. This year also marks  30 years since Welles died and, paradoxically, during the past three decades it has become easier for us to know Welles than it was when he was alive. \nThis is because almost every film appearance Welles ever made, most of his interviews, his monologues, outtakes, and many of the documentaries he took part in from 1936 until 1985 have been posted on YouTube. It's the scattered detritus of a man's artistic and personal life collected in one convenient location. These hundreds of hours of miscellaneous footage tell us much more about Orson Welles' opinions and prodigious energies than any of the tendentious biographies. It's a repository in the clouds. \nOrson Welles in Citizen Kane . \nAs talk-show guest du jour, Welles was, to paraphrase British interviewer Michael Parkinson, one of the greatest talkers of all time. He probably did more TV appearances than any other important artistic figure of the 20th century. He was so articulate, the screen goddess Marlene Dietrich once said that every time she talked to Welles she felt like a plant that had just been watered. \nAdvertisement The Welles miscellany online is extraordinary. There's footage from his first Hollywood screen test right up to his last TV interview 40 years later. A special treat is Welles' mea culpa during a press conference after the infamous Martian hoax of 1938 (he pranked America by broadcasting a fake radio news flash about invading Martians and created national panic). Perhaps the most moving footage is his reflective final interview with Merv Griffin recorded in 1985 just hours before Welles died. Incidentally, he was found slumped before his typewriter at home, aged 70. Heart attack. A perfect writer's death.\nThe fact that so many people have posted these clips up on YouTube points to an ongoing fascination with the man – although few people under the age of 50 will remember when Welles was the ever-present guest of variety shows. What many do remember are the TV ads he did, for wine and photocopiers. This was in the 1970s when doing ads was a sign of commercial failure, rather than the cheerful celebrity endorsement of today. \nRita Hayworth and Orson Welles at home in 1945.

He was in the ironic situation of being uncommercial while having to make commercials to feed himself. In the end he was just a voice for hire. \nOrson's mellifluous, bass voice was one of the most extraordinary instruments of the 20th century. He was the original choice for Darth Vader but he ended up instead as the voice of Robin Masters, the mystery writer you never see in the series Magnum PI . \nWelles' preternatural voice narrating the opening of his 1942 movie The Magnificent Ambersons is like the aural equivalent of a sublime and very rich chocolate cake. He had the voice of God when he was still just a kid. Influential American film reviewer Pauline Kael​ observed that Welles was one of the few actors that had to grow into his voice.\nNew York's Daily News captures the terror of Orson Welles' famous Martian broadcast on its front page of October 31, 1938. Photo: Getty Images \nOne of the most notorious examples of Welles' vocalisations is an infamous tape featuring Welles recording an ad for frozen peas. He approaches the dialogue as though it were Shakespeare. He launches into a tirade at the director over a point in grammar. Welles bluntly offers to \"go down on\" the beleaguered director if he can demonstrate how it is possible to say \"in July\" with integrity. It's a vivid demonstration of how hopeless it is to try to bring integrity to advertising.\nIf you read the biographies, Welles comes over as a divisive figure: an innovator and genius to some, a profligate, narcissistic windbag to others. He was probably all these things, a man of such charm and contradictions writers will never be able to meaningfully connect all his loose ends. Actor Simon Callow's two magisterial biographies of Welles probably come closest to developing a full and humane understanding of this complex man.\nCallow describes a creature inside whom prodigious assets and deficits jostle for supremacy. But no matter how well researched the biography, you always wonder what Welles was really like. Watching him share his opinions on Orson Welles' Sketchbook for the BBC in 1955 you can see he's a deeply reflective man of great learning who favours progressive politics. You also sense an emerging anxiety underneath that confident and euphonic voice. What can he be worrying about?\nHe must have struggled to cram in all his adventures. Houdini showed him magic tricks, he wrote speeches for President Roosevelt, he married the screen siren Rita Hayworth, he drank with Ernest Hemingway and Errol Flynn, he entertained Winston Churchill and he partied with Frank Sinatra. In the 1930s he was one of the most successful young directors of the American stage. At just 25 he directed Citizen Kane , for decades critically acclaimed as the greatest film ever made. In later years the new Hollywood royalty worshiped him. Steven Spielberg took him to lunch; Jack Nicholson idolised his talent. \nWas he afraid of failure or was it bad luck and studio interference that stopped Welles from completing his later films? The clues may well be there, embedded in the hundreds of film clips. On the internet Welles is forever alive to our questions and those of a phalanx of interviewers either fawning or forensic. In a 1970 David Frost interview, Welles demonstrates how alleged psychics use cold reading to fake clairvoyance. He clearly knows how easily people can be fooled and how dangerous the results can be. Is this a clue too?\nAs a guest on Dinah Shore's talk show in 1979, Welles provides a breathtaking extemporised monologue on the illusions that make television work. He tells the studio audience that the laugh track added to sitcoms were recorded decades past and that most of those laughing died long ago. Those merry peals of laughter are now \"echoing out of the graveyard\". Welles delights at the lugubriousness of the observation, and the alarmed audience squeals nervously. \nThis delightful perversity was Welles' most palpable curse. He didn't have a mainstream American sensibility. The stories he liked involved irony and unhappy endings. In the interviews and in his movies, Welles seems constantly to be protesting in some way against the vulgarities of the modern world. His themes are elegiac and involve the loss of innocence. When Welles was making movies, American film culture tended to privilege simple moral stories of triumphalism.\nWelles himself now speaks to us out of the graveyard via YouTube and remains a compelling storyteller about his own life and preferences. In one of his most illuminating interviews with Bernard Braden in Paris in 1960, Welles, not yet at his artistic nadir, is philosophic about his work. In life, he says, there are far more important things than art. \"I prefer every other loyalty in life to art,\" he explains. \"I hate the romantic conception of art as taking precedence over anything. I think it's the last thing to be considered, always.\" It's the sad look in his eyes that really hits home. It's tempting to conclude that Welles felt he'd wasted much of his life making or trying to make movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:06:04.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
