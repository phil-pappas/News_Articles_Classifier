Producers for the show will reportedly work around her absence. \nSpeaking about her struggles with the condition recently, the actress said, \"It's something a lot of women experience. When (you're told) about postpartum depression you think it's, 'I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child' - I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. \n\"But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal.\" \nRepresentatives for Panettiere and the show have yet to comment on the news.
