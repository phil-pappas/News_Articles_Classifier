On Monday, he was moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to continue treatment. The incident is under investigation . \"You can never be prepared for an experience like this, but without the outpouring of love and endless prayers that Lamar has received and the strength I was given from my loved ones, it would have been difficult to endure,\" Kardashian wrote. \"Thank you for your continued support. God is great!!!\" Kardashian and Odom are not yet officially divorced. During his hospitalization, she was responsible for making decisions regarding his medical care.
