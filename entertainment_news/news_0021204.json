According to The Tracking Board , Mattel will turn its 1980s toy line Dino-Riders into a movie franchise. According to the site's sources, Mattel has teamed up with Solipsist Film, a small Los Angeles-based company best known for helping produce \" Sin City: A Dame to Kill For \". Alissa Phillips and Stephen L'Heureux have been tapped to produce for Solipsist. The producing duo are currently looking for the right scribe to pen the screenplay. Dino-Riders was not a very popular toyline. In 1988, a 14-episode animated TV show was released as a way to launch the toy line and boost the sales. The animated series followed an epic war between two races, the human-like Valorians and the more-reptilian Rulons. The two races came from the future, but they ended up transported back in time to the age of Dinosaurs. As the war continued, they maximized their own efforts to convince dinosaurs on Earth to fight for them. The site claims that the plan is to develop a feature film which would target the family demographic, with a strong action-adventure storyline. As of today, the project has yet to be set up at any studio. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:45:07.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
