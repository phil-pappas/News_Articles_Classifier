As we enter the final round of fall debuts, this has been one of the most highly anticipated shows of the season. \nThere's good reason for that, and much of the credit goes to Benoist, who you may recall for her role as Marley Rose on Glee. \nHere, Benoist plays Kara Danvers, a 24-year-old resident of National City who has a job running errands for high-maintenance media mogul Cat Grant, played by Calista Flockhart. \nKara, of course, has a big secret: She actually is Kara Zor-El, cousin of Superman. Kara shares many of her famous cousin's powers, as unrefined as they may be at this point. \nFor reasons that are explained in the first episode, Kara thus far has spent her life on Earth playing it straight, if you will. But she has grown restless. She took her current job thinking she could accomplish big things, but she essentially is a gopher. \n“I didn't travel 2,000 light years just to be an assistant,” she laments. \nThe turning point for Kara comes when she realizes that someone close to her is in imminent peril. Kara doesn't have time to think. She acts. \nSubsequently, having saved lives for the first time, Kara is exhilarated. She wants to keep making a difference. But there are risks she hasn't considered. She admits, “I'm not sure what comes next.” \nPart of the answer to that question is the element of Supergirl that I referred to earlier. You know, the part of the show that I don't want to take over the show. \nKara encounters a secret government military organization called the Department of Extra-Normal Operations. The DEO has endless resources and exists to protect Earth from alien invasion. And to that I say, well, yawn. \nLook, as I mentioned earlier, Benoist is awesome as Kara. \nI like the workplace setting, with Kara trying to impress her boss Cat, while at the same time growing closer to a transfer from Metropolis named, um, James Olsen, played by Mehcad Brooks. I don't recall Jimmy Olsen being a tall, confident, muscular, hunky black man, but hey, maybe that's just me. \nI also like the “emerging Supergirl” side of the saga, as an excited Kara embraces her true identity, naysayers and worry-warts be damned. \nBut she doesn't need to be stymied and stifled and controlled and discouraged as a mere plot device, or conversely aided and encouraged, by a secret government military organization, you know? I don't need it to be “Supergirl's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” for the love of God. Wait, that's the other comic universe? Whatever, I'm sure you get what I'm saying. \nHere's what I want Supergirl to be, moving forward: I want it to be about Supergirl. I want it to be about Melissa Benoist, as Kara Zor-El, as Kara Danvers, as Supergirl. I want it to be about her struggles, personal and professional and extra-terrestrial. \nThe creators of Supergirl cast the lead role really well with Benoist. They shouldn't waste any of her with B.S. about government plots and military programs, which reminds me of, oh, I don't know, just about every other show on TV. \n“One of my favourite moments in the pilot is at the end when she's flying around, just seeing the unfettered joy on her face, reveling in this power, in this freedom,” said Andrew Kreisberg, who executive produces Supergirl alongside Greg Berlanti, Ali Adler and Sarah Schechter. \n“There are a lot of heroes who are very ambivalent about their powers and very dour, and we're certainly guilty of putting some of those people on TV (Arrow, for instance). But one of the great joys of Supergirl is that she really loves being Supergirl.” \nYou'll love her, too. Let's just keep the government interference to a minimum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:43:04.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
