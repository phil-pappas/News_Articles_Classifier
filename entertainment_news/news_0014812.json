Show People working in theatre, film, television and live events can now visualize their work and dramatically streamline the collaborative creative process.\n\"After working on several large and small-scale productions, we recognized that the technology available for today's Show People was majorly inadequate and forced creatives to adapt their processes to technology, rather than benefit from technology that mirrors the way they work,\" said Alex Libby , founder, ProductionPro. \"Creative and Show industries are constantly under pressure to deliver faster, create more and do it all under budget and resource constraints. ProductionPro was designed to address these needs and facilitate rapid collaboration, by reflecting the processes and approaches that Show People already use.\"\nThe platform, currently available for iPad devices, is built upon a proprietary algorithm that visually breaks down each scene of a production, or Show. It enables all parties involved in the creation or management of a show – from script writers to costume design and marketing – to view the most up-to-date version of a Show in development at any given moment.\nProductionPro synthesizes all choices and changes made by a Show's creative team, including freelance and amateur users. Key features include:\nThe Visual Scroll: The visual assemblage of all aspects of a Show Easy Navigation: Flip the orientation of the iPad to quickly view the corresponding script content Progress Sharing: Share the current versions of Show scripts and visual breakdowns with collaborators, partners and investors Archiving: Each individual, production company, and school has access to all shows new and old ProductionPro was designed by a team of highly skilled engineers and theatre and film professionals. It is available for iPad devices on iOS 8.4 or higher. The free version is available on the App Store now. A premium version is expected to be available in Q4 2015.

A panel of expert judges and audience members selected ProductionPro from seven showcased contestants for its potential for disrupting the existing technology and media space. The Center is a partnership between IFP and the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment.\nFor more information please visit www.Production.Pro or download the platform on the App Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/productionpro/id982036196?mt=8 .\nAbout ProductionPro :\nProductionPro is a technology company focused on developing a universal, visual canvas for the development of a Show.
