Photo: Getty Images \nFans are calling for refunds after American rapper Childish Gambino was booed off-stage in Newcastle. \nChildish Gambino, also known as 30 Rock writer and Community star Donald Glover, delivered a set that divided fans and left some outraged. \nPerforming for more than an hour, Glover's efforts did little to win over a crowd that had been chanting his name earlier in the evening.\nFour hours after eager fans queued through the venue in anticipation for the sold-out gig, many were asking for their money back and slamming a performance in which the headline act barely uttered a word for 40 minutes.\nAdvertisement The show, announced less than two weeks before the performance, had earlier sparked feverish entries in a competition on the venue's Facebook page. \nHoping to win two tickets, some fans had pledged to travel from Melbourne for the event if they were successful. \nBy the end of the night, fans were taking to the same Facebook page wishing they had missed out.\n  #childishgambino #soldout #thecambridgehotel #newcastle\nPosted by The Cambridge Hotel on  Thursday, October 1, 2015 Glover spent more than an hour on stage with a large entourage, including members of the audience, performing a selection of his favourite songs in a \"mixtape\" performance. \nBut the show appeared to curdle after the rapper spent about 40 minutes at the beginning behind turntables and seated near the rear of the stage, the audience's enthusiasm waning as his entourage joked with audience members long before they began playing music.\nFinding his voice later in the show, Glover delivered glimpses of the lyrical skill that earned him a strong enough following to play the Listen Out festival, where his performances have won extensive praise.\nBut his fast finish at the Cambridge Hotel was not enough to win back the Hunter fans, with the crowd left chanting obscenities after he performed a solo falsetto song and left the stage.\nGlover appeared visibly surprised and upset by the crowd response, which included obscenities insults aimed at the rapper written in perspiration on the glass windows of the venue. \nA DJ playing songs after his set immediately played the rapper's 3005 , sparking a mixed response from a crowd who had expected to hear the rapper deliver the song himself.\nA handful rushed the stage in the hopes Glover may reprise the stage and salvage the show before filing out as they realised it would not happen. \nTempers boiled over when a 15-second clip of the show was posted on the venue's Facebook page about 11.30pm, towards the end of the show.\n\"Cool video,\" one user wrote.\n\"Did you film the part where he was booed off stage and we were all left disappointed?\n\"That was a massive middle finger to Newcastle,\" another wrote on the venue's Facebook post.\n\"A lot of that crowd were under 18 and that was not a cheap gig, I love you donald but that wasn't cool.\"\nThis sums up Gambinos disaster gig at @TheCambridge @hmrthompson @NickMilligan_ @TimConnell @MattCarrNH pic.twitter.com/T1nWLrg1np \n— nickgerber (@nicholasgerber) October 1, 2015 @donaldglover that was a massive middle finger to Newcastle, a lot of that crowd were under 18 and that was not a cheap gig!\n— Mark Owens (@Shark_Poems) October 1, 2015  \n\"Had to wait 40 minutes after he came on stage before he even said a word,\" another wrote.\n\"Cheers for the atrocious karaoke gambino and crew.\"\nSeveral defended the performer, who earlier in the day cancelled a Canberra performance due to a \"busy touring schedule taking a toll.\"\n\"I thought it was great!! Childish Gambino killed it tonight,\" one Facebook user wrote. \"Top show!\"\nNewcastle Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:16:09.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
