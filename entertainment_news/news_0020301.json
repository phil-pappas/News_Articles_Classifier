Hoover's Carlo Joseph did, and knew that he'd live there one day. \nThat dream house was the biggest in the area at the time and he passed it every day when walking to school. It was nestled among the trees four houses down from his own. \nThe large and mysterious house at the end of a long narrow driveway was barely visible from the front, due to the property's numerous trees and overgrown plants. But something about the white two-story Southern colonial captured his fascination so much that he would sneak through the woods behind the house, armed with youthful curiosity and a BB gun, to check out the house from the rear. \nDecades later, Joseph doesn't have to glimpse the house from afar. In fact, his name is on the historical marker that sits in the front yard. \n\"I knew when I was 10 years old that I was going to buy this house,\" he said. \"I always thought it was my destiny to live in this house.\" \nThe Hale-Joseph home is listed on Hoover, Jefferson County and Alabama historic registers. It originally was a farmhouse built in 1909 by William and Evan Hale, descendants of two signers of the 1620 Mayflower Compact. \nThe home was built on land purchased by William for $400 in 1905. It was surrounded by orchards and sat on 400 acres of what was once the Hale Springs Resort area, now Hoover's Shades Mountain Bluff Park community. \nSince then, several families have settled into the 5,000 square-foot house with six fireplaces. \nTommy Tucker's family moved into the house in 1944, before people started building homes of the face of the bluff. In the 1950s, the owners of the home removed porches surrounding the farmhouse in favor of stately columns. \nYears later, Jim Parsons and his wife Bobbie Jo Wallace-Parsons , daughter of Alabama governors George and Lurleen Wallace, bought the property. They made several renovations to the home, such as adding tennis courts, a dog kennel, a pool, a garage and a 650-square-foot hunting trophy room in 1982. \nMeantime, Joseph never lost his goal of owning the house one day. After graduating from the University of Alabama in 1981, he started leaving notes for the Parsonses on holidays, asking them to call him first if they decided to sell the house. \nHe's living proof that a little perseverance goes a long way. \nIn 1993, that call finally came. One month prior, Joseph, Vice President and Partner at V&W Supply Co. Inc ., and his wife Dianne had purchased a new home in Shelby County. But they bought the Parsons home that day, and later sold the Shelby County home. \nThe Josephs, then parents to three young girls, hired people to help restore some of the home's 1910 roots. They uncovered original walls, removed green shag carpeting and refinished the wood floors. They removed a drop ceiling in the kitchen, revealing the original decorative wood beam ceiling. \nThey also dusted off the home's original 1910 golden oak Glacier Sanitary Refrigerator and pie safe left by the Parsons family and previous owners. The pie safe sits next to a vintage Humphrey water heater of the same era. \n\"We tried to keep the house from a historical standpoint, the way it was,\" Joseph said. \nAs he realized, older homes have their challenges, including a lack of closet space. Tall ceilings, lack of insulation and original windows made this house tough to heat and cool. It was expensive to maintain, especially for a young family living on a tight budget. \n\"We ate a lot of hot dogs and Spam to live in the house,\" Joseph said. \nHis goal was to fix as many problems as possible without disturbing the home's structural footprint. The house is well built, a benefit of older homes according Joseph. It has survived area storms, tornadoes and hurricanes. \n\"What houses are they building today that are going to last another hundred years?\" Joseph said while giving a tour to AL.com. \"They don't build houses like this anymore.\" \nThe quiet and secluded home is surrounded by 100-year-old trees, including three giant oaks and fig, pear and apple trees. It continues to be a cherished, vital part of the community -- a gathering place for family and friends that's also available for charity events, historical society teas and parties. \n\"It's really a community house,\" Joseph said, \"and we always try to open it up whenever someone needs it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:07:29.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
