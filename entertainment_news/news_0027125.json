Back then, I was a tenor who didn’t have high notes. I was so green.”\nSince then Panikkar has ripened mightily as an artist.\nAfter getting his master’s in music at UM, Panikkar was accepted into the Merola training program at San Francisco Opera.\nThen his career ignited like a Roman candle. In addition to regional companies, Panikkar has sung at the Met in New York and La Scala in Milan.\nThat’s a huge leap from his high school graduation, where Panikkar got his first standing ovation after singing “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”\nBut nothing prepared him for the recognition he’d receive when he joined the crossover group Forte. In 2013 the group competed on “America’s Got Talent,” sending audiences swooning with their interpretations of “Unchained Melody” and “Somewhere.”\nThey came in fourth place, but that television exposure got the group (which includes tenors Josh Page and Hana Ryu) plenty of gigs, including Carnegie Hall.\nPanikkar says he doesn’t prepare any differently whether it’s opera or Forte’s “popera” concerts.\n“I warm up the same way,” he says. “My role in Forte is to be the opera singer in the group and sound like it. I never had to change the way I sang.”\nIn “La Boheme,” Panikkar is singing opposite soprano Nicole Cabell, who plays his love interest, Mimi. He says they have a good rapport.\n“All of our instincts as Rodolfo and Mimi are completely in line,” he says. That’s not always the case.”\nBorn of Sri Lankan heritage in Bloomsburg, Pensylvannia, Panikkar studied violin, piano and trombone and sang in choir, but he didn’t seriously think he’d pursue a musical career. When he enrolled at UM, it was as a double major: civil engineering and music.\n“My original goal was civil engineering as an undergrad and then a master’s in architecture,” he says. “I wanted to have my own construction company.”\nInstead of building structures, Panikkar ended up building a towering musical career. He says he really got interested in opera when Daniel Washington, one of his teachers at UM, gave him a recording of Canadian tenor Jon Vickers. Panikkar was hooked on opera.\n“What I loved was the way he inhabited the role, not just physically but in his voice; it was communicated so effectively,” he says.\nBeing an opera star requires a delicate balancing act when you’re also a husband and father, as Panikkar is. He’s married to Jane, a choral director at Concordia University in Ann Arbor. They’re the parents of Maria, 7, and Mark, 4, and make their home in Saline, southwest of Ann Arbor.\n“I love being a dad,” he explains. “I’d take them everywhere if I could.”\n\nMOT’s ‘La Boheme’ \n7:30 p.m. Oct. 17-25.\nDetroit Opera House\n1526 Broadway, Detroit\nSean Panikkar and Nicole Cabell sing Oct. 17, 21 and 24. Alternating in their roles Oct. 25 are Eric Margiore and Lina Tetriani.\nTickets: $29-$149.\n(313) 874-SING\nmichiganopera.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:28:16.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
