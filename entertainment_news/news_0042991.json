Vacations. Natural disasters.\nAnd even with Hurricane Joaquin potentially heading out to sea, weather looks dismal for the next for downs. In which case, a little bit of mood music can't hurt.\nOnly songs named after Joaquin are harder to come by than Sandy. Although actor Joaquin Phoenix — the goat of many lame hurricane jokes of late — did record several Johnny Cash classics for his 2005 biopic \"Walk The Line.\"\nAnyway, here are storm-themed tunes from Bob Dylan, CCR, Rihanna and more, placed in a new Spotify playlist to welcome the rain and wind.\nAnd on the Jersey side, we have offerings from Bruce Springsteen, Frank Sinatra and The Gaslight Anthem.\nIn all, here are 20 tunes to help us all ride out the storm.\nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
