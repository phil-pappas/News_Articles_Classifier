This show is a great fit for Dare to Defy because of the scope of our talent and the Mathile is an ideal setting for the intimate experience we want to create for the audience.”\n“ ‘Godspell’ strikes a chord as we see ourselves in each character,” said Tia Seay, a standout last season as Donkey in Playhouse South’s production of “Shrek The Musical.” “From the modern housewife trying to keep up appearances and learning that her happiness doesn’t come from material things to the Average Joe who learns to forgive others like we would want to be forgiven. There are so many valuable lessons to be learned. My hope is that everyone will find the answer they’re searching for to become the person they would ultimately like to be.”\nThe cast, a conglomeration of performers previously seen with such organizations as Beavercreek Community Theatre, Dayton Playhouse, Playhouse South and Sinclair Community College, includes Bobby Mitchum as Jesus, Desmond Thomas as John the Baptist/Judas, and ensemble members Marcus Bedinger, AJ Breslin, Jamal Caan, Courtney Dortch, Esther Hyland, Danielle Kubasky, Hayley Penchoff, Natalie Sanders, and Grant Warden. Norgaard’s artistic team includes music director Lorri Topping, choreographer Mackensie King, lighting and sound designer Jason Vogel, scenic designer Michael Stockstill, and pianist/band leader Dean Brown.\nSchwartz’s delightful, touching folk/rock score, which has re-orchestrated vocal/musical arrangements as evidenced in its 2011 Broadway revival, includes “All Good Gifts,” “Beautiful City” and “Day by Day.”\n“The music will rock you out of your seats,” Seay said. “I’m excited for everyone to see ‘Godspell.’ Come for the music. Stay for the life lessons.”\nContact this contributing writer at rflorence2@gmail.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:06:20.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
