Comment By G. Wayne MillerJournal Staff Writer Posted Oct. 11, 2015 @ 12:01 am Editor's note: \"Quest of Three: Part One\" kicks off The Providence Journal's three-part holiday short story contest. See related story for contest rules about how you can submit entries for the middle and final chapters of the tale. “Triple trouble,” said one who knew well, their mother, Jill Harris. “And we mean that literally,” said their dad, Jill’s husband, Craig. “Figuratively, too. Really, they are a handful.” They were Isabella Harris, age 9; Olivia Harris, age 8; and Vivienne Harris, age 6. Isabella was the athlete, excelling at soccer and track. Olivia was the academic — a “brain,” some observed, though all three girls were respectably bright. And Viv? Well, that was yet to be determined. Viv could be funny, pouty, exasperating and wise beyond her years, often all at the same time. “An old soul,” Dad said, whether as a compliment or not he never let on. This was established fact: the girls loved pranks. Like the time they hid Dad’s computer in the linen closet and pinkie-swore it had been stolen. Or secreted the family pet, Ringo, a Cairn terrier, away in the treehouse and told Mom he’d been dog-napped. Or slipped plastic spiders into the cafeteria salad bar at their school, a stunt that landed them in the principal’s office. Favorite holiday? April Fools. Need you ask? “It’s in our genes,” Isabella said, a reference to Dad’s high school yearbook, in which it was confirmed he’d been voted Class Clown. “Who doesn’t like a good joke?” Olivia said. “Old farts,” Viv said. “There’s often a fine line between good humor and bad behavior,” Mom said. “We know,” said Isabella. “We see it whenever we cross it.” Which had gotten her sent to her room. Not much of a punishment, really, considering she shared her room with her sisters in the small house in which they lived in the quiet village of Astoria. So, the Harrises could be forgiven for not believing what their daughters claimed that Saturday morning in mid-October when they rushed inside after climbing down from the tree house, the place where they plotted many of their schemes. The place Jill and Craig regretted having built and regularly threatened to tear down. A hollow threat, as the girls knew. The daughters said they had received a warning from An Ancient Sage that, unless they followed his instructions precisely, the rest of the 2015 holidays would be ruined for everyone, in horrible ways. And the whole world would blame them. “Nice try, girls,” Jill said. “Now go do your chores.” “But it’s true,” said Isabella. “We’re not making it up.” “Cross our hearts and hope to die,” said Olivia. “We have to obey,” said Isabella. “We’d be worse than the Grinch if we don’t,” said Viv. “The skunk at the lawn party; isn’t that the saying?” said Olivia. “That’s one of them,” said Craig. “Now do as your mother says. We have soccer in an hour.” The parents noticed that Isabella was holding something behind her back. “OK,” she said, “how do you explain this?” She revealed a rolled, yellowed piece of paper. A scroll, seemingly papyrus. “You think we could have made this?” said Olivia. “We’d have to be Moses or whoever that weird dude with the robe and beard was who came down from the mountain,” said Viv. “Here, touch it,” said Isabella. “It’s real.” “And real old,” said Olivia. Craig and Jill examined the scroll, their fingers feeling its crinkled surface, unlike any paper they’d ever seen. If it was a prank, it was a mighty sophisticated one. And almost certainly beyond their daughters’ talents, prodigious though they were. “Looks like someone’s turned the tables on you,” said Craig. “Like we didn’t think that?” said Isabella. “Who would go to such trouble?” “And why?” said Olivia. “Just for fun?” said Viv. “Oh, please. Get real.” The Harrises had to admit, albeit only to themselves, that the girls had a point. “Read it,” said Isabella. Craig and Jill opened the scroll, revealing an apparently hand-written message, rendered in apparent old ink in an apparently authentic Gothic script. My Dear Isabella, Olivia and Vivienne, It is hereby decreed that you three, and you three alone, have the ability to save this year’s autumn and winter holidays from a fate too horrible to describe. Please do not question why you have been chosen, or what Evil would seek to ruin the good times of so many good people, for you shall get no answer. Know only that it was written in the stars, many eons ago. Should you accept this assignment — and for the sake of not just you and thy family and the village of Astoria but indeed the whole world, I recommend you do — you shall be given a succession of clues, each deriving from the one before and leading ultimately to the location of the Magic Charm. The Charm looks unlike anything you might imagine, but I trust you to recognize it once it is beheld. When activated, the holidays will be saved — and the world, should you wish to share your secret, will greet you as the heroes you will be. Please note that the clues must be discovered and heeded in the order given, and by the deadlines dictated, or grave consequences shall result. Of this, I cannot say more. And thus, I present ye the initial clue: “By the light of the moon, as supper is served three days ‘til witches fly, look behind the door of the shed to the side of the cottage six numbers down.” With all best wishes for your quest, I am, An Ancient Sage. “Now what do you say?” said Olivia. “I say we’ll be confiscating this,” said Jill. “But we have to comply,” said Isabella. “Even if we were to let you,” Craig said, “and most decidedly we will not, what exactly would you do?” He read the clue aloud. “Gobbledygook,” he declared. “Some smart aleck’s idea of a joke,” said Jill. “Believe me, he or she won’t be happy when we find out who it is.” After soccer and a snack, the girls repaired to the tree house. Their parents had hidden the message somewhere, perhaps in the family lockbox, to which they had no key, nor even knew the location, “proof when we need it,” their mother had said. “Now what?” said Olivia. “We’re screwed,” said Isabella. “Well, we still remember the clue, right?” said Viv. “Yes!” her sisters said. “So, we figure out what it means.” After an hour of discussion, they believed they had reached a conclusion. By the light of the moon, as supper is served, they had decided, meant 6 p.m., when the Harrises sat down to dinner every night. Three days ‘til witches fly surely meant Wednesday, Oct. 28, three days before Halloween. And the door of the shed to the side of the cottage six numbers down could only mean Mr. Davis. He lived six houses south of the Harrises on Elm Street. “But how are we going to get out at that time?” said Olivia. “You know how Mom and Dad are about family dinner.” “Yeah,” said Olivia. “No TV on and not even a book at the table. Which wicked sucks.” “We create a diversion,” said Isabella. “What’s a diversion?” said Viv. “Something to distract them.” “I could make myself throw up,” said Viv. “That would definitely distract them.” “Then what?” said Olivia. “We all run out the door.” “Vivienne, you’re just being silly,” said Isabella. “But I have a real idea.” Her sisters listened and when she had spoken, they fist-bumped. At 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 28, the land line rang at the Harris residence. The girls were in their room doing their homework. Jill and Craig were in the kitchen, preparing dinner. Jill picked up. A muffled voice congratulated her for winning a trip with her family to Disney World — but in order to claim it, she and her husband would have to come immediately to prize headquarters, at an address in another town a half-hour away. The voice was providing more detail when Jill threw open the door to her daughters’ room. The girls turned panicked. Isabella dropped her mother’s cell phone. “I don’t know what nonsense you’re up to,” Jill said, “but I do know this: You’ve lost TV privileges for a week. Now give me my phone. And go set the table.” The rain began the morning of Friday, Oct. 30, and by nightfall, it was a deluge. Halloween dawned with a heavy wind driving a cold, heavy rain: a classic nor’easter, the meteorologists called it. At dusk, the girls dressed in their costumes, but they lasted but a few minutes trick-or-treating before they were drenched and shivering. Almost no one was out. Back home, they were readying for hot showers when the power went. Similar outages were reported across the state and beyond. In some places, the electricity was off all evening. Ruined though it was, Halloween was a lesser holiday. Thanksgiving lay ahead, and beyond Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah and the other occasions that good folk celebrated. Isabella, Olivia and Vivienne went to sleep sharing a disturbing foreboding. By Sunday morning, the storm was lifting. During breakfast, the girls subjected their parents to a round of told-you-sos and warnings of worse yet-to-comes, which were met with threats of groundings. When the dishes were cleared, the girls went outside to play. Craig went into the basement, where the lock box was hidden. The scroll was gone when he opened it, though a residue of ash, as if it had spontaneously combusted, remained. He and Jill were certain the girls could not have found the lockbox key, which itself was hidden in a bag of frozen peas at the back of the freezer, where the girls would never think to look; Craig was a bit paranoid like that. Even if they had, they never would have burned it. The parents said nothing to their daughters, but they were mystified and increasingly anxious. This was a prank of a dark and higher order. As their parents read the Sunday paper, Isabella and Viv played in the yard, creating cover for Olivia, who snuck off with Ringo to Mr. Davis’ house. She opened the shed, but found nothing unusual behind the door, or anywhere. Ringo sniffed nothing out, either. The clue, if there had been one, had vanished. Olivia returned with the bad news. Their luck, if that is the word, turned when they climbed into the tree house. A second scroll awaited them. My Disappointing Isabella, Olivia and Vivienne, Ordinarily in these circumstances, no second chances are allowed; Evil, sadly, will have its way. But you did your best to succeed while your parents did their best to foil and thus I shall make an exception — this one time alone. So here is your second clue — the final one, be assured, should you fail again: “On the third first day of the last full autumnal month, at three turns of the clock shy of the witching hour, meet with best friend at the village rectangle divided exactly in half. Be thee but one minute late, and ye shall sorely wish thou hadn’t.” With doubt regarding your ability to complete your quest, I remain, An Ancient Sage. After days of pondering and extensive use of Google and Wikipedia, the girls believed they had deciphered the directive. On the third first day of the last full autumnal month, they decided, meant Sunday (first day of the week) November (last full month of fall) the 15th (the third Sunday in that next-to-last month of 2015). Three turns of the clock shy of the witching hour meant midnight: three hours (turns of the clock) before 3 a.m., generally held to be when the witching hour begins. Best friend could only mean a dog, Ringo. A village rectangle divided exactly in half surely meant a village square, in the middle of Astoria. And: Be thee but one minute late, and ye shall sorely wish thou hadn’t? Goosebumps, every time they thought of that. The girls could not have been more compliant in meeting their 8:30 p.m. bedtime on Sunday, Nov. 15: Not a whimper or word of protest, which should have set off an alarm with their parents, but didn’t. Jill and Craig were too upset at the loss of their football team. Isabella, Olivia and Viv immediately feigned sleep. The Harrises were fooled when they checked at 10, as they were turning in. The girls were not asleep, of course, and neither was Ringo. At 11:30, the girls tip-toed to their window and stepped onto the roof of the attached garage. Isabella slid along the downspout to the ground, to assist her sisters and catch Ringo. With their dog, the girls set off for the village square, guided by flashlights and keeping to the side of the road should they need to duck into the shadows at the approach of a car. But there were no cars, no people, no animals, only pitch dark. So far, all had gone according to plan. To be continued ... About the author Staff writer G.
