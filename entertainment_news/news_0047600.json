Zack is a horror comedy that takes horror very seriously.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273258\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273257\nA year ago, Zombies started rising here and there. We expected the apocalypse. Instead, we got... pests. Zack Zander is a redneck, metal head with a talent for zombie-splatting. And his whole family gets in on the action. Together, the Zanders make up Z-Gone, \"semi-professional\" zombie exterminators. And they showcase every second of gory mayhem on YouTube.\nOvernight, Zack's exploits catapult him from viral video joke to primetime hero. With fame come the spoils: cooler clothes, better gear, and a sexy sidekick.\nBut as Zack's ego skyrockets and his family ties snap, a cooler crew of zombie killers challenge Z-Gone's TV supremacy, The Dead Patrol . Soon Zack takes a fall, losing everything-his money, his family, his girl. To make matters worse, an ancient evil rears its ugly head, threatening to bring forth a hellish undead apocalypse.\nNow, Zack has one chance to make things right. And all he has to do is kill a horde of flesh hungry zombies and a stop the god of Death from destroying the world.\nZack the Zombie Exterminator is co-written by Mike MacLean (Sharktopus, Dino-Croc vs. SuperGator, Piranhaconda) and Brian Pulido ( Lady Death , Evil Ernie, Chaos! Comics, A Nightmare on Elm St., Friday The 13 th , Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Chucky ) and fiendishly illustrated by industry newcomers Djibril Morissette-Phan (illustrator) and Ceci de la Cruz (color).\n\"It's like Wayne's World meets Dawn of the Dead ,\" says co-creator Brian Pulido . \"The horror is real, but the characters' reactions are where the comedy lies.\"\nThe graphic novel launched on Kickstarter September 30, 2015 , 7:00 PM PST .\n\"We all love AMC's The Walking Dead . Week after week the show delivers gut-wrenching drama, dangling its characters over the brink of extinction. It's thrilling, thought-provoking, and... utterly depressing. That's not Zack,\" says Mike MacLean . \"Simply stated, Zack the Zombie Exterminator puts the fun back into zombie-splatting.\"\nFrom the twisted minds of Brian Pulido and Mike MacLean comes the rise, fall and redemption of an American original, Zack the Zombie Exterminator\nFor more information: talestold@cox.net , www.LadyDeathUniverse.com .\nContact:\nContact: Brian Pulido\nPhone: 213-453-3859\n releases/zack-the-zombie-exterminator-ready-to-showcase-his-talent-for-zombie-splatting-300153174.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273257", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.ladydeathuniverse.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zack-the-zombie-exterminator-ready-to-showcase-his-talent-for-zombie-splatting-300153174.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273258", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brianpulido/pulido-macleans-graphic-novel-zack-the-zombie-exte", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH18221&Transmission_Id=201510020840PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH18221&DateId=20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:10:45.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
