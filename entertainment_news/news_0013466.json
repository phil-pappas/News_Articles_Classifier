The 19-year-old launched the successful blog a year ago. Just a few days shy of her fashion blog's one-year anniversary in mid-September, 19-year-old Nia Alleyne stepped out of a Manhattan taxicab and found herself in front of camera flashes and shouts from photographers. Unaccustomed to the attention, she instinctively covered her face with her hands.\nIt was her first time being invited to and attending New York Fashion Week, thanks to her blog's success; Let's Wear Black garners thousands of views a month and has 36,000 followers on Instagram. Yet the Woodcliff Lake resident still can't believe how far she's come in 12 months. \nMost posts on the site feature the 5-foot-3-inch Alleyne wearing her favorite, of-the-moment outfits (not always black, as the title might suggest) from such brands as Zara, Rag & Bone, Madewell and ASOS, with links to the brands' websites. Rarely does she face the camera head on; often Alleyne is pictured from the neck down. The photographs are bold, colorful and arresting. She hired two professional freelance photographers to shoot for her whenever her schedule allows it. The outfits she wears are her own, though Alleyne admitted that days when she has class, she dresses more casually: Adidas Superstars sneakers, T-shirt, Lululemon leggings, a black leather jacket, a pair of sunglasses and an \"arm party\" of rings and bracelets. After all, Alleyne joked, when she was growing up, her mother would always say, \"School is not a fashion show.\"\nVoted \"Best Dressed\" in her class at Saddle River Day School, even though it has a uniform requirement (creative accessorizing came in handy), Alleyne said she's often used clothing to express herself because she's otherwise quite shy. She's watched every season of reality competition \"America's Next Top Model\" since it premiered in 2003, and learned to shop by watching her sister, who is also into fashion and would often return from jaunts to Europe with fabulous clothing. \n\"Her style is just effortless, so I always wanted to keep up,\" Alleyne said. A wall of her bedroom is still lined with pages from Teen Vogue magazine.\nIn high school, she did an internship at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and helped the store put on its first Fashion Night Out event. Her personal style, Alleyne said, is \"not too revealing,\" and a bit \"boyish,\" though when her mom begs her to, she does shoots wearing a dress or skirt. \nAnd though she's always loved fashion, she didn't think of it as a career until she was applying to colleges. \n\"I had written a bunch of college essays and had to re-do everything in like a day,\" she said. \"My parents knew all along that I loved fashion, but they wanted me to figure it out for myself.\"\nAfter completing her freshman year at Pace University, Alleyne transferred to Parsons School of Design this fall where she is majoring in media and culture and fashion communication. In between the switch, she launched Let's Wear Black.\n\"It takes a lot to put myself out there, but the motivation to kick myself in the butt and just do it was seeing so many young girls out there who also have popular blogs,\" Alleyne said. If they could do it, she thought, â€¦ \nHer dream is to be the owner of a Bergen County women's boutique that sells underrepresented brands not commonly found in department stores. One she likes is Reformation, because \"they have eco-friendly clothing that's very simply but beautiful.\" \nAlleyne admits she's no fashion expert yet, and is still learning her way around the industry, which she confided can be intimidating. \n\"I feel the industry can come off as elitist, which was nerve-wracking for me in the beginning,\" she said, \"but I've been able to connect with a lot of great people and I've been giving out my business card.\"\nNetworking is how she got the invites to several New York Fashion Week shows, some of which she got to experience from the front row. \n\"I just want to encourage confidence and individuality,\" she said. \nEmail: toribioe@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:33:19.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
