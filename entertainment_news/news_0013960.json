Donna’s probably gone for a flash guy in the past, but Fats is kind-hearted and he can handle her attitude as well. \n“They’re good mates, so I think they’d make a great match.” \nLisa said the kissing scene – her first on the show – had its challenges. \n“It was actually really funny, as things kept going wrong in the studio every time we went to kiss. A light cracked, and then we kept having to redo it through various problems like that,” she explained.

But our director was brilliant and Ricky is so professional that it wasn’t a big deal,” she said.

What’s been lovely this time is that I’ve been able to spend the last year and a half with Ricky, getting to know him.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:29:02.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
