Both are 100 per cent cotton, both made in China.\nBut the pink version costs six times as much as the blue.\nWhy? Because one’s from the high-end label Collette Dinnigan Enfant, sold in David Jones, and the other is part of Dinnigan’s new range Young Hearts, from Aldi.\nShoppers stormed the supermarket chain on Wednesday when the range was released, with customers queuing from dawn to snap up a bargain.\nAnd boy did they get a deal — fashion fans were delighted to discover the Aldi range was almost identical to the Paris runway queen’s high-end ­kidswear brand.\nIn fact, some of the items appear to have used old patterns from her main line label with only a slight drop in quality.\nOther Stories What’s the Buzz: Saint, sinner, shoosh Nrl 0 comments My lifesaving surgery is killing me Nsw 0 comments Alleged GoPro gang rapist already on bail Nsw Former NRL star ‘dragged woman down stairs’ Nsw ‘Why do sports clubs ignore victims?’ Nsw 0 comments Falconio killer ‘more like a prison guard’ Nsw At Canterbury, shopper Cath McCarthy didn’t care that the designer range was stocked in giant bins somewhere between the washing powder and power tools.\n“I love Collette Dinnigan but can’t usually afford her,” she said.\nThe Aldi range is beautiful — lots of cotton day dresses, frilly shorts and T-shirts, with prices starting at $12. The problem is, the clothes sold out in just hours and now if you want one, cheeky eBay sellers are asking upwards of $50 for the dress above.\nConfidential is open to all reasonable offers . . .", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a75b28370a0ad33daa7c22124a656c72", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/60e790f3c0b5d1eb2cacff7c5a7be6f5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1d522f5e81b5d5eddf22ed4e71c451e8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f5d3c5460b8ca5e0ac6bdad36a514511", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9791bf946e979a3a7c7ee4fd6a0c1721", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:53:38.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
