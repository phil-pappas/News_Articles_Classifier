This long-awaited collaboration between O'Brien and Keating is the story of Australia's 24th prime minister and a portrait unlike any other. \nKeating, a visionary, reformer, true believer, rabble rouser, polymath and our most intriguing prime minister, bares his soul to the country's sharpest political interviewer, O'Brien. \nO'Brien and Keating wrestle with history to produce a tour de force of political wisdom and personal insight that weaves through the Keating years in a unique and compelling way. \nBuilding on the transcripts of the ABC TV's Keating: The Interviews, O'Brien has gathered an enormous bank of new material, gleaned during many hours of further conversation with Keating, to create a book that is more forensic and all-encompassing than the successful TV series. \nKerry O'Brien captures the hallmarks of the man, the nimble mind, the wit, the sweep of vision, the ruthlessness and the stubborn drive for power as Keating explains the historic events, backroom stoushes, moments of drama and pathos that the political world inevitably holds. \nThe festival will present Peter Garrett to discuss his highly anticipated memoir Big Blue Sky on October 28 also at the Byron Theatre. \nGarrett the musician, activist and former Cabinet minister will chat with David Leser, covering Garrett's childhood, career with Midnight Oil, environmental activism and his time as a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments. \n\nBARRIE CASSIDY: Is a veteran Australian political journalist, as well as a radio and television host, presenter and commentator. He has hosted ABC TV's Sunday morning political discussion show Insiders since its inception in 2001. \nKERRY O'BRIEN: A respected Australian journalist who has been awarded six coveted Walkley Awards during his career. The former editor and host of The 7.30 Report now hosts another long-standing ABC TV program, the current affairs show Four Corners. barrie cassidy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:45:51.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
