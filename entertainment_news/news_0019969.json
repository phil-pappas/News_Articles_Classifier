While her bilingual Thoongavanam in Tamil (Cheekati Rajyam in Telugu) with Kamal Haasan is gearing up for release, the ravishing lady has her kitty full with horror films like Aranmanai 2 and female-centric flicks Nayaki and Bhogi. It is known that Trisha is particular about maintaining her svelte figure. And the secret behind her beauty is the balanced diet and regular workouts that include swimming. The VTV actress, whose busy schedule had kept her away from taking a refreshing dip in the water, is now finally back to her first love — swimming. Trisha, who is currently shooting for Nayaki in Hyderabad, tells DC, “I love to swim, but since I was constantly shooting I could not get time for it. Recently, I got a break as Nayaki’s shoot wrapped up early and returned to the hotel soon. Without wasting time, I rushed to the pool and started at sunset and came out after a solid two hours.” She posted a picture of hers on her microblog and wrote, “Back 2 my 1st love #sunsetswim #waterbaby #favexcersise #50laps #wastrainedbythebest #mukundansir.
