While the British actor was there to talk about his upcoming film \" Spectre \", the reporter asked him to show his signature pout. Sarah suddenly came up with the question, \"The Daniel Craig pout, are you familiar with it? Do you know what we're talking about? James Bond pout.\" The actor was a little surprised and confused. \"Not really, no,\" the actor said as the reporter tried to mimic his pout. \"Is that what it looks like?\" Craig responded to the reporter's pout. \"I think you're going to show me it. Show me it,\" Sarah insisted. \"No,\" Craig politely refused it. \"Go on. Do me a little pout. You know when your role is there,\" the reporter said as she tried to strike a James Bond's pose and mimic the pout. Craig was seemingly tired and said, \"I think you need to move on.\" The reporter simply replied, \"Okay.\" Later on, Sarah joked, \"Has James Bond gone shy?\" The 47-year-old actor responded, \"He's going shy now.\" In \"Spectre\", Craig reprises his role as the spy agent and he has to uncover a sinister organization. He stars alongside Lea Seydoux , Ben Whishaw , Naomie Harris , Ralph Fiennes and Dave Bautista . The action movie is set to be released in U.S. theaters on November 6. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:14.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
