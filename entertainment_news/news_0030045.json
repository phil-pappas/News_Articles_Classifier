Since Lamar was hospitalized after he was found unconscious in a brothel, khloe has been staying by his side. Meanwhile, a source tells PEOPLE that James is just \"keeping respectful distance\" from Khloe as she cares for her estranged husband. \"He is so nice and being as supportive as humanly possible given the situation,\" the source explains. The insider close to the Kardashians family adds, \"Lamar essentially has zero consistent family other than the Kardashians, and James understands that. The last thing he would want to do would be to add more stress to her plate.\" James is reportedly supporting Khloe from afar. \"He never had any intention of going to Vegas. He supports her of course, but understands she needs space and to be with Lamar,\" another source claims. Lamar Odom was discharged from hospital in Las Vegas shortly after waking up from coma and slowly making progress. He is reportedly transferred to a rehabilitation center in Los Angeles. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:18.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
