And Matt Garbowsky, RIT's leading scorer and Atlantic Hockey's Player of the Year last season?\nHe's still going through the adjustment period to a life in hockey that doesn't include school.\nWhen practice with the Rochester Americans ends, so pretty much does his work for the day, save for maybe a team meeting.\n\"It's kind of funny because all those guys (at RIT) are going to classes and I'm just kind of sitting around doing nothing,\" he said.\n\"It's not like I laze around but I can take my time after practice and stretch out; I'm not running off to class right away.\"\nHe's also not yet putting to use his degree in business management that he earned during his four years on the Henrietta campus. Instead, he's hoping to prove he has the talent to play in the American Hockey League.\nThe next step in that audition comes Thursday night â€” right back at his home the previous four years, RIT. The Amerks play the Binghamton Senators at 7:05 p.m. at the Polisseni Center. Tickets are $5 ($3 for RIT students).\n\"Honestly, I tried not to think about it too much, just kind of keying in on the practices,\" Garbowsky said. \"It's definitely going to be cool going back to what was my home campus for four years.\n\"It will be kind of crazy playing in the same building in a different uniform. I'm obviously very proud to have played four years at RIT and of everything RIT has given me.\"\nBuy Photo The Amerks Matt Garbowsky attacks with the puck against goalie C.J. Motte during a training camp earlier this week. (Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/ STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nGarbowsky, 25, signed an American Hockey League contract with the Amerks in March, not long after the Tigers' run to the NCAA Midwest Regional finals. He attended training camp with the Buffalo Sabres on a tryout contract and while he didn't play in an NHL preseason game, he did wear the Sabres uniform in the Prospects Challenge against the New Jersey Devils.\n\"It was definitely exciting putting on the Sabres logo,\" he said.\nHe did get eight games of pro experience with the Amerks in April, providing a chance for him to measure his game with the AHL. He learned areas that needed improvement. A big one: quickness; being able to produce instant acceleration. His summer workouts were geared toward improving it.\n\"That extra step, even if it's a half a second, it's a big difference in this league,\" he said. \"I tried to key on a lot of my weaknesses in the gym and stuff and I really wanted to work on my explosiveness.\"\nHe did a great deal of hill running and resistance running. He did block jumping. One thing RIT coach Wayne Wilson also said about Garbowsky: he loved to work.\nWhile that won't change in the pro game, his role will. A year ago, he barged into the Hobey Baker Award top 10 after producing 26 goals, 28 assists and 54 points in 40 games. But he's no longer a top-line center. Instead, he'll be an energy-line center or left winger and a penalty killer.\n\"You know you're going to get the hard work every time he steps on the ice,\" Amerks coach Randy Cunneyworth said. \"Where he needs to improve is in finishing situations and he needs to concentrate on that speed. He needs to be able to pull away from bigger guys, go through bigger guys.\"\nGarbowsky said he's fine with his new role.\n\"I'll be an energy kind of guy,\" he said. \"I still want to put up points when I can and get the opportunities I think I can put up some numbers. But I don't think I'm going to be relied on as heavily as a scorer as I am just an energy guy.\"\nKEVINO@gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4affce369fcaae2b68bbdd59cb9bea8435896b9d/r=500x351/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792272275979462-garbo-practice-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792272275979462-garbo-practice-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90a8c8810f3ec54b4c8e28cd90664c1fda70dc3b/c=0-0-3482-2618&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792272275979462-garbo-practice-pic.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:07:12.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
