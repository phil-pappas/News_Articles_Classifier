His heart is reportedly failing, and he's having problems with his kidneys and lungs. Ex-wife Khloe Kardashian has been by his since since Tuesday at 8 p.m., according to a source. She asks that fans keep Odom in their thoughts and prayers, and for the media to respect his privacy during this difficult time.\nKardashian's older sister, Kim Kardashian, and mother, Kris Jenner, as well as Odom's former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant and Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak are by his bedside, too. The Lakers were in Vegas for a pre-season game against the Sacramento Kings.\nThe former NBA player and star of E!'s \"Khloe and Lamar\" reality series was found unconscious at the Love Ranch South on Tuesday morning in Crystal, Nev. This was after multiple days of partying, reports TMZ, which first broke the news.\nOdom was apparently intubated in an ambulance, an indication that he was not able to breathe on his own. He was stabilized and transported to Desert View Hospital, arriving at about 4:16 p.m. Authorities conducted an investigation of the scene.\nArrangements were made for Odom to be airlifted to a Las Vegas hospital for further treatment. However, because of his stature (Odom is 6 feet 10 inches tall), he was unable to be airlifted, and was transported by the Pahrump Valley Fire and Rescue Ambulance to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas.\nBrothel staff immediately called 911 after finding him unconscious, according to E! News, and Odom was put on his side when he began spitting up liquid. It is said that he had taken herbal Viagra, and ordered a bottle of cognac for the room, a third of which was still left by Tuesday, according to the LA Times.\nOdom has reportedly not yet regained consciousness. Dennis Hof, the owner of the brothel, told KNX that they're \"very concerned\" about him.\nOdom, the ex-husband of Khloe Kardashian, previously went missing two years ago after a drug-fueled bender at a Los Angeles hotel. He also appeared in \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" during the on-screen romance with the reality personality. He entered rehab for drug and alcohol abuse in 2013.\nOdom played a year of college basketball at the University of Rhode Island before turning pro at the age of 18. He played for 14 seasons as a power forward in the NBA, including seven with the Los Angeles Lakers and five with the Los Angeles Clippers. He has not played in the NBA since the end of 2012-13 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:26:57.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
