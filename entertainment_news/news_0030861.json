But they wouldn't be Bond for the simple reason that wasn't what Ian Fleming wrote,\" he reportedly told the Daily Mail: \"It is not about being homophobic or, for that matter, racist - it is simply about being true to the character.\" \nOther Bond actors, including both Daniel Craig and Pierce Brosnan, have backed the idea of a different Bond, Craig saying he \"doesn't give a f**k\" if a black or female actor takes on the role. \nMoore went on to comment how villains being from 'undefined nations' was also an issue: \"There is a danger always of causing offence. I suppose you could just about get away with a villain from Burkina Faso, but that's about it.\" \nHe also claimed Timothy Dalton was his favourite Bond, saying: \"The films didn't deserve him. He'd distinguished himself on the stage and did some interesting things with the part.\" \nSpectre, starring Craig, Christoph Waltz, Monica Bellucci, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris, is due in UK cinemas on 26 October.
