Is this for real? Can it harm the engine? I know you don't think much of most fuel additives, but this came pretty highly recommended by this landscaper who looked old enough and in business long enough to know what he was talking about. What's the deal?\n— V.C., Woodridge, Ill.\nA: Unless your automobile or lawn equipment is very, very old, it will have no problems using gasoline containing up to 10 percent ethanol (E10). In the case of gasoline containing up to 15 percent ethanol (E15), which is common in the Midwest, damage can be done to older vehicles. Your CR-V should be fine. Fuel hoses are made of fuel-resistant compounds, and carburetor gaskets are also impervious. Problems usually only occur when you store the equipment. At which time we suggest using a fuel stabilizer such as Sta-Bil or another brand that has been around for a long time. We looked up the MSDS (material safety data sheet) and found that Star Tron is over 95 percent naphtha and less than 0.5 percent \"proprietary organic compounds.\" We do not believe this product will do any damage. However, we checked our local Home Depot and found the product selling at $7.77 for 8 ounces and naphtha at $7.98 per 32 ounces.\nQ: Many cars now have push-button start. The brochure for the 2015 Toyota Camry carries a disclosure paragraph stating: \"The Smart Key system may interfere with some pacemakers or cardiac defibrillators. If you have one of these medical devices, please talk to your doctor to see if you should deactivate this system.\" I am a pacemaker wearer, and I am concerned about buying a 2015 automobile with push-button start. I have not consulted my cardiologist on this matter as yet, but I would like your opinion on this disclosure.\n— R.W., Macungie, Pa.\nA: From the research we have done, the general consensus is that the risk is relatively low that you would have a problem unless you keep the smart key in your shirt pocket, near the pacemaker. Twelve inches or more separation seems to be a rule of thumb. But this is not a medical advice column, so please check with your doctor.\nQ: The reverse gear on my 1996 Saturn SW2 (automatic, 145,000 miles) has acted erratically for several months. At times, the reverse works fine, but at other times, it will not engage and will even go forward while still in reverse. Applying the brake and gently giving it gas will finally get it into reverse but with a \"slam,\" which I know is not good. The car runs fine otherwise. I know it would be impossible to say when it might fail, but is this an immediate repair? While I realize you cannot recommend one, should I stay away from those franchise places? Is an independent mechanic better?\n— B.K., Chicago\nA: There is no knowing when something will fail, but it usually becomes worse or noisy. Most franchise transmission repair places stock rebuilt transmissions on the shelf and send yours out for rebuilding. That way, they can provide quick turnaround. The odds are that you will get a good unit; otherwise they would be out of business. We prefer an independent who will rebuild our own transmission and that rebuilder must belong to ATRA (Automatic Transmission Rebuilders Association) and preferably be ASE-certified in automatic transmission repair.\nBob Weber is an ASE-certified master mechanic and freelance writer.\nSend questions along with name and town to Motormouth, Rides, Chicago Tribune, 435 N.
