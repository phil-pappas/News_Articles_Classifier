The event was documented on the blog clubhousecancer.com.\nThe hat \"was given to him by the Cubs on a visit to Wrigley. Worn once,\" Seinfeld's publicist Tom Keaney said in an email to the Tribune.\nPerhaps Seinfeld, a native New Yorker, was following baseball game etiquette outlined in a 1992 episode of \"Seinfeld,\" when Elaine Benes (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) was ejected from a New York Yankees game for refusing to take off her Baltimore Orioles hat while sitting in the Yankees owners box.\nThe Cubs face off against the Mets for Game 3 of the National League Championship Series Tuesday at Wrigley Field. The Mets lead the series 2-0.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs New York Mets Wrigley Field New York Yankees National League", "external_links": ["http://www.clubhousecancer.com/2008/05/17/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE8ljMY5qn4", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56253099/turbine/ct-jerry-seinfeld-mets-cubs-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:06:45.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
