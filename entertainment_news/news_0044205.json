Forget that comet that was supposed to hit us. This time, a giant planet called Nibiru is due to hit Earth in and around December, which will really impact on all the shopping and Christmas parties you'll have to attend.\nNutjobs Theorists claim that a rogue planet, known as Nibiru, is on a 3,600-year cycle around our solar system. According to Mayan texts, Sumerian texts, a woman who has been contacted by aliens from the Zeta Reticuli system (no, really) and a whole load of evidence that governments are hiding, the planet is due to collide with Earth just as we're sitting down to watch Mrs. Brown's Boys or Harry Potter for the twelfth time.\nAs theorists would have it, Nibiru has been hidden from society at large because governments fear that the panic would cause society to collapse and, y'know, that's bad. Never mind the fact that a giant planet is going to kill everyone, better that we all continue to live in blissful ignorance. Ah-huh. Sure. Makes sense. Seems legit.\nThis latest doomsday prediction comes on foot of a Bible Fellowship, who said we were all done for earlier in the week and the supposed Blood Moon which was to act as a sign of an impending apocalypse. Oh, there was also a comet that was due to hit somewhere around Costa Rica and wipe out all of America and cause tidal waves that'd ruin everything.\nSo, naturally, we're banking on this Nibiru to do the job and finish us all off. Because everything that came before was clearly just a preamble.\nVia Telgraph.co.uk\nMORE: Pic: Rock formation on the Moon looks like a human face\nMORE: Astronomers find \"giant alien megastructures\" orbiting the Milky Way\nMORE: Seven conspiracy theories that turned out to be real", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11932700/end-of-the-world-doomsday-december.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:14:44.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
