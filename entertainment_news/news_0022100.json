I was hanging out with some pretty rough characters,' the 'Goosebumps' actor recalls his troubled past when he's 14 years old. \nJack Black admitted that he had a dark past dealing with drugs. The \" Goosebumps \" actor told Parade magazine that he was addicted to cocaine when he was 14 years old, 4 years after his parents divorced. \"I remember just lots of turmoil from that time period,\" Jack recalled the time after his parents split. \"I was having a lot of troubles with cocaine ... I was hanging out with some pretty rough characters. I was scared to go to school [because] one of them wanted to kill me. I wanted to get out of there.\" Jack's parents enrolled him in Poseidon, a private school which was infamously known for \"troubled youth\" in Los Angeles. \"Most of the other kids there were expelled from other schools, but I went voluntarily,\" he said. \"It was a place to press the restart button.\" The 46-year-old actor felt like he had no one to turn to. He couldn't tell his parents as he's afraid if he would make them totally upset. \"Being raised a Jew, I didn't have any kind of confessional. I couldn't talk to my parents about the things that I was most guilty about,\" he said. \"My dad loved me very much, but I needed someone who wasn't judgmental at all, who wasn't going to be disappointed with me.\" As he couldn't hold his guilty feeling any longer, Jack then told everything to a school therapist. \"I spilled my guts, telling him I felt guilty about stealing from my mom to get money for cocaine. I cried like a baby. It was a huge release and a huge relief. I left feeling euphoric, like an enormous weight had been lifted from me. It changed me,\" he recalled. As of now, Jack is grateful for living with his wife Tanya Haden and their children. \"Before Tanya, I had always felt like marriage was not for me,\" he confessed. \"I didn't like the way it worked out with my parents. I didn't ever want to be in a divorce, so I was never going to get married.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:08:54.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
