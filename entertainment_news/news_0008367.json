Uhls said many parents naturally combine their familiarity with technology and excitement around a new baby. But she added a caution: \"I think it's a dangerous trend when it's done too much.\"\nA 2010 report from online security company AVG Technologies shows that 92 percent of U.S. children under age 2 have some type of digital footprint. A third have information and photos online within weeks of being born, the study found.\nToo much screen time could be damaging kids' eyesight Heidi Stevens One more reason to send your kids outside this summer: Experts are warning of a poor-vision epidemic among children, thanks to all their screen-staring.\nA recent study found nearsightedness has doubled among young people in Britain over the past 50 years, prompting eye surgeon Steve Schallhorn,...\nOne more reason to send your kids outside this summer: Experts are warning of a poor-vision epidemic among children, thanks to all their screen-staring.\nA recent study found nearsightedness has doubled among young people in Britain over the past 50 years, prompting eye surgeon Steve Schallhorn,...\n(Heidi Stevens) A similar report from AVG in 2014 showed 6 percent of parents had created a social network profile for a child under 2, and 8 percent made an email address for a baby or toddler — a slight increase from 2010.\nWhat to snag online, if anything, for your brand-new baby is a personal parental decision. And although a seemingly natural extension of posting pre-baby food or vacation snaps, parents might not think through the long-term implications of carving out social space online for babies.\n\"We always caution that whenever you're posting images, (look) at the settings to make sure you're sharing it with the right people you intended to,\" said Julia Wang, site director at The Bump .\nSecuring a digital birthright\nWhen his twins were born three years ago, Shereem Herndon-Brown had plenty to plan. But one thing he made time for was reserving the twins' domain names.\n\"I think it's very, very common these days that parents do it, but I do recognize that we need to be responsible with it,\" said Herndon-Brown, founder of Strategic Admissions Advice , a website offering college-admissions assistance.\nFor now, the parents use them just to share photos with family. But he can't help but think ahead to a time when his children's online presence will be a factor in their lives.\n\"We will make sure there's nothing up there that wouldn't be something that could help them, not hinder them,\" he said.\nExperts say many parents choose to reserve a domain name, perhaps adding photos or a blog. Others might nab the name but do nothing with it, holding it, for example, for a possible future portfolio. Most platforms regulate that a child needs to be at least 13 to be on social media, said Augusta Nissly, program coordinator for the Washington, D.C.-based Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI).\nHow this affects a child later varies — and is a bit unpredictable, experts agree. After all, no one knows what the digital world will look like in 18 years.\n\"I think that all depends on what they do with that domain name in the time period before they hand it over to their child,\" Nissly said.\nAnother thing parents often consider? Email. Parents often set up an account in the hopes of avoiding the inconvenience, for their child, of having to add a jumble of numbers at the end of the email address.\n\"They're kind of thinking ahead and trying to lock that in,\" Wang said.\nIt's a millennial thing\nYoung parents, especially millennials (ages 18 to 34 in 2015), are jumping on this trend.\n\"Millennial parents are on social media, and they're on their digital devices and smartphones all the time,\" Wang said. \"This is very much a part of their lifestyle.\"\nChild-rearing in the digital age: 5 real tips to help kids and parents Adam Pletter Why is my 6-year-old twerking?

How do I limit what my 10-year-old can see on his phone?\nThese are common questions with complicated answers, but as a parent and child psychologist, I have some basics to help you and your children navigate the digital world safely (with a little help from the engineers...\n(Adam Pletter) A 2014 BabyCenter report on millennial moms showed that 79 percent use social media at least daily. And in this year's BabyCenter \"State of Modern Motherhood\" report, 63 percent of respondents reported using their smartphone more since pregnancy or birth.\nMost millennial moms and dads have Facebook and Instagram accounts, and they might use them even more after baby: According to BabyCenter, since becoming pregnant or a mother, 24 percent reported using Facebook more than before, and 33 percent had bumped up logging onto Instagram.\n\"Instagram is really made for the millennial parent, because it's just all about photo sharing,\" Wang said. \"You see many moms who are the power Instagram users, who love posting photos of their child and styling them.\"\nFor sites like Facebook or Twitter, some simply store a name. Others might use a handle to tweet humorous things from the voice of baby — \"I tried carrots today!\"\nHaving a Facebook site just for a baby can be excellent etiquette, Wang noted. If a parent feels she is posting too often on her own page, she can create a page just for baby and her fans. Then, \"all those 102 pictures of the baby are really dedicated for the family and close friends that are really interested about all of your baby's development,\" she said.\nPause before posting\nWang said Bump message boards often discuss privacy and whether to post infant photos. Indeed, discussing digital expectations and decisions is a great first step for new parents, who are especially vulnerable to the temptation of posting.\n\"You're so excited about your child, you want to share it,\" Uhls said.\nBut before posting a photo on Snapchat or a website that's open to anyone, think it through.\nFirst, parents need to become fluent in privacy settings. FOSI provides videos on navigating the sometimes-confusing world of Facebook privacy settings and removing your location from Twitter .\nFor example, many parents sharing photos of their child's first day of school unwittingly include the school's name, revealing to the Internet a child's daily location.\n\"Information that can be used to locate the child or identify information about them, that would not be a good idea,\" Nissly said.\nEven if you think only friends see a post, anyone can take a screen shot, she noted.\nCommon Sense Media , a nonprofit media advocacy group for families, warns of children's photos falling into the wrong hands, whether through identity theft or showing up on unintended websites. In May, a Utah mother found that photos of her daughter and 9-month-old son had been used on social media with hashtags connected to porn sites.\nThe organization notes that having a password-protected account on photo-sharing sites like Flickr or Photobucket is an option. They also suggest apps that are designed to be privately shared, like Notabli, 23snaps and eFamily, which they say offer secure ways to share with a small group.\nWhen baby grows up\nAlso, think ahead to when your 13-year-old asks why you posted that bathtub photo when he was a baby.\n\"They're probably not going to think that's very funny to have on social media,\" Nissly said.\nUhls, who also works with Common Sense Media on the digital intersection of parents and children, added that it's hard to later tell teens to be careful online if you didn't model the same caution.\nAnd, she pointed out, it's nearly impossible to know what your brand-new baby would think.\n\"They don't even know who their child is. They don't know who they're going to be. Are they going to be shy? What are they going to be?\" Uhls said. \"And by making this choice for them early on, are they cramming them into a box that they may not want to be in?\"\nabowen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @byalisonbowen\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Snapchat, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56183655/turbine/sc-parenting-digital-age-family-1020-20151009", "http://blog.sfgate.com/sfmoms/2015/05/05/utah-mom-finds-photos-of-her-kids-on-porn-sites", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56267fba/turbine/sc-babies-digital-real-estate-family-1027-20151020", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55a7dd19/turbine/ct-child-vision-problem-computer-balancing-20150716", "http://www.avg.com/digitaldiaries/2010", "http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/591449/Children-play-outside-better-eyesight", "http://www.babycenter.com/", "http://www.thebump.com/", "http://www.fosi.org/good-digital-parenting/how-set-facebook-privacy-settings", "http://www.fosi.org/good-digital-parenting/how-remove-geo-tags-twitter", "http://www.commonsensemedia.org/", "http://www.twitter.com/byalisonbowen"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:33:54.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
