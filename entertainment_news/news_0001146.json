Aubrey Smith are among the strangers who find themselves in isolation and danger in “And Then There Were None.” \nThomaston — The Friends of the Thomaston Public Library’s Friday Night Film Series, hosted by Erika Pfander, offers free movie screenings weekly at 6:30 p.m. in Room 200 of the Thomaston Academy building at 60 Main St./Route 1; entrance, parking and handicapped accessibility is at the rear of the building. October’s Murder a la Agatha Christie theme is concluded Oct. 30 with “And Then There Were None” (1945, USA), a nonrated film that runs 97 minutes and is based on Christie's “Ten Little Indians.” Ten strangers are invited as weekend guests to a mansion on a remote island. When the host doesn’t show up, the guests start dying, one by one, in uniquely macabre Agatha Christie style. A brilliant cast is led by Academy Award winning actors Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston, directed by Rene Clair. \nFriday Night Films are open to the public free of charge, although donations are gratefully accepted. Light refreshments will be served. For more information, call the library at 354-2453. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
