By Elmo Weeks\nTrey Kent spends most of his time worrying about someone else’s scores, but he proved he’s got plenty of game of his own during the first round of the Savannah City Amateur on Saturday at Bacon Park Golf Club.\nKent, who caddies for Savannah’s Mark Silvers on the Web.com Tour, returned from a three-year hiatus from tournament play to shoot a 3-under-par 68 that leads the City Am by a stroke over John Skeadas III. In the first City Am round on the fully restored Donald Ross course at Bacon Park, only three players in a field of 96 broke par.\nBehind Kent and Skeadas III, is Davy Clay, a two-time Wilmington Island Club club champion, who turned in a 1-under 70. Phillip Kennedy is fourth after an even-par 71, and there is a tie at 1-over par that includes defending champion John Skeadas II, Southbridge Golf Club club champion Rafael Array, Jeff Cowart and Joey Dewitt.\nKent, 35, played college golf at Armstrong State University from 2002-2005 and was a member of the team that finished runner-up in the NCAA Division II national championship tournament played at The Club at Savannah Harbor. He only recently regained his amateur status, and the City Am is his first stroke-play tournament in three years.\nThe last time Kent played in the City Am, he was the runner-up to Austin Meadows in 1995. He bogeyed his first two holes on Saturday, but calmed his nerves and played the next 16 holes in 5 under par, including four birdies in a row on Nos. 8-11.\n“After those first two, I realized I needed to play golf, because I’m better than bogeying the first two holes,” said Kent, who is originally from Millen. “I called (Silvers) on Friday, and he gave me some good advice that helped. He said just try to keep it in front of you and don’t do anything stupid.\n“It was a good round, but I feel like I left some out there,” Kent added.\nOnly one stroke behind Kent is another player who has not been playing much golf. Skeadas III played college golf at Davidson College but is currently in his third year working toward a law degree and masters degree at the University of Georgia, leaving him very little time to visit the links.\nSkeadas birdied two of the three par-5 holes and only made one bogey in the first round playing alongside his father and former City Am champion Danny Nelson in the first round.\n“I was fortunate to hit it pretty well and getting to play with my dad and (Nelson) (in) this tournament was a blast,” said Skeadas III, whose last tournament round was in July at the Golden Isles Invitational in Brunswick. “The course is a lot different, but it’s different for everyone out here. For everyone who grows up in Savannah, the City Am is a big deal, because when you look at the trophy you see a lot of the most important names for Savannah golf.”\nLurking only two strokes behind Kent is Clay, the club champion at the Wilmington Island Club in 2013 and 2014. He decided to play in honor of the late Don Vickery, who was the teaching professional at the Wilmington Island Club who taught Clay the game.\nWith the initials, “DV”, in marker on his golf ball, Clay, 29, was 4 under par through 11 holes before suffering bogeys on Nos. 12, 15 and 17. Playing in the City Am for the first time since 2006, he will be in today’s final pairing.\n“Not knowing the golf course very well, I just hung in there making pars until I could make a couple of birdies,” Clay said. “I missed a couple of easy putts for par, but I’m definitely happy with the round. I love being in contention, so we’ll see how it goes.”\nCITY AMATEUR SCORES\nFirst Round, Saturday\nBacon Park Golf Course\n68—Trey Kent\n69—John Skeadeas III\n70—Davy Clay\n71—Phillip Kennedy\n72—Raphael Array, Jeff Cowart, Joey Dewitt, John Skeadas II\n73—Philip Haug, Trent Williams, Hamish Huntley.\n74—Shawn Elmore, Ben Brennan, Tripp Coggins\n75—Peter Brennan, James Wohler\n76—Stuart Edwards, Danny Nelson, Parker Stone, Marc Stroud\n77—Jeff O’Connor, Will Grotto, Walter Hagan, Christian Parker\n78—Bob Remler\n79—Will Gallagher, Nate Tosto, Joe Frederick\n80—Barry Brennan, Carl Ward\n81—Will Sharpe\n82—Machi Cossio, Matt Bauman\n83—Les McDaniel Jr., Kyle Pratt, Andy Becker\n84—Chris White\n86—Kevin Sethpun, Lenny Talarico\n88—Matt Nixon, Darrell Gaffney\n89—Reed Oyer, Tony Rosssing, Henry Wyndham, Mike Gonzalez\n91—Josh Dundon\n97—Stephen McInerney\nMen’s Net\n77—Keith Thomas\n79—Josh Courter\n84—Marc Friedenbach, David Allgire\n87—Ryan Maines, Marshall Washington\n91—Jason Anderson\n97—Eric Williams\n98—Owen McConnon\n107—Justin Roberts\nSenior Championship\n74—Randy Dees, Mike Forehand\n75—Don Consos, Bill McClosky\n76—Howard Bacon\n77—Mike Morris\n79—Mario Williams\n80—Scott Pearce\n82—Pat Winters\n83—Tom Rood\n84—Mark Berry, Mike Peters, Ed Almstedt, Jerry Kappa, Rudy Vaughn\n93—Les McDaniel\nSenior Net\n79—Kenny Hughes\n82—Charlie Clarke\n84—David Davis\n89—Bill Whitsett\n89—Mike Sills\n112—Steve Cummins\nLegends\n70—Bill Massey\n73—David Fogle\n74—Don Lieb\n75—David Schaller, Mike Towson, Howard Tomlinson\n79—Lary Brown\n81—Charlie Daniels\n86—Chris Uhl\n87—Denver Combs\n96—Roger Benton\nCITY AMATEUR PAIRINGS\nToday’s tee times\n8 a.m.—Denver Combs, Roger Benton\n8:10 –Chris Uhl, Charlie Daniels, Larry Brown\n8:20—David Schaller, Howard Tomlinson, Mike Towson\n8:30—Bill Massey, Don Lieb, David Fogle\n8:40—David Davis, Bill Whitsett, Steve Cummins\n8:50—Ken Hughes, Charlie Clarke, Mike Sills\n9—Edward Almstedt, Les McDaniel, Rudy Vaughn\n9:10—Jerry Kappa, Mike Peters\n9:20—Pat Winters, Mark Berry, Tom Rood\n9:30—Mario Williams, Scott Pearce\n9:40—Bill McClosky, Howard Bacon, Mike Morris\n9:50—Randy Dees, Mike Forehand, Donald Consos\n10—Justin Roberts, Owen McConnon\n10:10—Ryan Maines, Eric Williams\n10:20—David Allgire, Marc Friedenback, Jason Anderson\n10:30—Josh Courter, Keith Thomas, Marshall Washington\n10:40—Josh Dundon, Stephen McInerney\n10:50—Matt Nixon, William Rossing, Henry Wyndham\n11—Darrel Gaffney, Michael Gonzalez, Reed Oyler\n11:10—Chris White, Leonard Talarico, Kevin Sethpun\n11:20—Andy Becker, Les McDaniel II, Kyle Pratt\n11:30—Will Sharpe, Matt Bauman, Machi Cossio\n11:40—Nate Tosto, Carl Ward, Barry Brennan\n11:50—Bob Remler, Joe Frederick, Will Gallagher\nNoon—Jeff O’Connor, Will Grotto, Walter Hagan\n12:10 p.m.—Stuart Edwards, Matt Stroud, Christian Parker\n12:20—James Wohler, Danny Nelson, Parker Stone\n12:30—Ben Brennan, Shawn Elmore, Peter Brennan\n12:40—Hamish Huntly, Trent Williams, Tripp Coggins\n12:50—Rafael Array, Joey Dewitt, Philip Haug\n1—Phillip Kennedy, John Skeadas, Jeff Cowart\n1:10 p.m.—Trey Kent, John Skeadas III, Davy Clay", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837505.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837514.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837505.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837514.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837512.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837510.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837503.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837507.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837510.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837512.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14837507.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14837503.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:14:40.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
