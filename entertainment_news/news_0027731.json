We have our fingers crossed.”\nWe didn’t like to point out that — as any new parent knows — even if the baby comes ­beforehand, Michael might not be in the good books if he’s on the high seas when his wife’s up all night feeding a newborn bub.\nKyly’s biggest concern is how to contact her husband while he’s out on the ocean.\n “The fact he is going to be uncontactable those two days and just not knowing when your baby is due to arrive ... it’s a bit of a worry,” she said.\nBut it’s all for a good cause — Clarke is participating in the annual race to help raise money for Bell’s Loyal Foundation for the purchase of medical equipment for children, a cause close to his heart.\n“We spoke about it for a long time before I made the decision and we both thought, for the cause, I can’t not go,” Clarke said.\n“Both my niece and nephew really struggled, especially my niece, she was born 10 weeks premature so without the machinery that she was on, she wouldn’t be here today.\n“Yes, there is risk and time away at an important stage for us, but as long as our baby is healthy, the plan is to get on that boat and try and raise as much money as we can for a good cause.”\nClarke, who sailed aboard the supermaxi in the Sydney to Gold Coast race last year, seemed to be more concerned about the perils of the sea.\n“I am scared about getting on the boat,” Clarke said. “I am petrified of sharks and the ocean.”\nStill, he hasn’t seen a new mum with no sleep yet. Best of luck to you, guys!", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-10T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:15:48.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
