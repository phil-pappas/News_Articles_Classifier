The team’s No. 1 receiver has fully participated in only two practices since the regular season began.\nAmong the pitfalls of a lingering injury are repetitive exchanges with reporters, and Jeffery certainly has had his share since Aug. 12, when he suffered a left calf injury that sidelined him for the whole preseason.\nJeffery’s chat with media at his locker Thursday afternoon felt familiar.\n“I’m just taking it one day at a time,” he said. “It’s a process. As a player, I want to be out there, too. But it’s a process. It’s a long season.”\nHe said the injury is not testing his patience because football players understand they’re going to get hurt.\n“I miss being out there a lot, but at the same time, it’s a process,” he said. “But I’ll be back out there soon, hopefully.”\nMaking matters worse for the Bears, receiver Eddie Royal (ankle) sat out practice for the second straight day.\nPrivacy Policy Alshon Jeffery Chicago Bears Kansas City Chiefs", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616d181/turbine/ct-alshon-jeffery-injured-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:40:49.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
