He added, though, that \"the time focus won't be on today, because if we look back a bit we see that refugees are a part of human history.\"\nStill, he said that he won't put political or human rights concerns into his teaching \"because I'm teaching in an art school.\"\nView gallery Chinese artist Ai Weiwei holds a cell phone as arrives for a news conference about his Einstein Prof … \"Of course, those (things) are in me but ... I will not put a pressure on them on this kind of issues,\" he said.\nAi's appearance in Berlin came amid controversy over an exhibition due to open in Melbourne in December, \"Andy Warhol/Ai Weiwei,\" which is to feature 20 portraits of Australian pro-freedom figures made from Lego bricks.\nAi said in a Friday post on Instagram that Lego refused a bulk order from the National Gallery of Victoria, saying in an email that it is against corporate policy to \"indicate our approval of any unaffiliated activities\" outside a licensing program. The artist accused the company of censorship and discrimination.\n\"I was pretty gobsmacked,\" Ai said Monday. \"It was a perfectly respectable order.\"\n\"Someone then had the idea of calling for donations of Lego bricks,\" he said. \"And it appears that we will now actually get enough Lego bricks together in order to be able to conduct this project as originally planned.\"\nLego said in an emailed response to a query about the matter that \"we respect any individuals' right to free creative expression, and we do not censor, prohibit or ban creative use of Lego bricks by any individual.\"\nHowever, it added that it refrains worldwide \"from actively engaging in or endorsing the use of Lego bricks in projects or contexts of a political agenda.\" That doesn't prevent anyone from purchasing Lego bricks through normal sales channels — which isn't possible for bulk orders — or otherwise getting hold of bricks, it said.\nAi Weiwei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:27:46.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
