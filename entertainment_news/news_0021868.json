In an interview with Billboard for the magazine's latest issue, the Mother Monster reveals that she has also suffered depression and anxiety like those kids. She says, \"I've suffered through depression and anxiety my entire life, I still suffer with it every single day. I just want these kids to know that that depth that they feel as human beings is normal. We were born that way. This modern thing, where everyone is feeling shallow and less connected? That's not human.\" \"There is something in the way that we are now,\" she explains, \"with our cell phones and people are not looking at each other and not being in the moment with each other, that kids feel isolated. They read all of this extremely hateful language on the Internet. The internet is a toilet. It is. It used to be a fantastic resource -- but you have to sort through sh*t to find the good stuff.\" The \" American Horror Story : Hotel\" actress continues, \"These kids just want to feel human, but they feel like robots. They don't understand why they're so sad. There are scientific reasons, which the foundation researches, why you feel sad when you look at your phone all day.\" A photo posted by Billboard (@billboard) on Oct 14, 2015 at 3:56pm PDT \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:46:47.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
