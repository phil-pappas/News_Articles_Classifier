Quaid said in an interview that he could be deported from Canada next week and that he would like to resolve his legal issues in California and \"move on with my life.\" The actor and his Canadian wife fled the U.S. in 2010, saying they were victims of persecution. AP More + \nA Vermont judge has ordered actor Randy Quaid held on $500,000 bail on charges that he and his wife skipped out of the country five years ago after being charged with vandalism in California. \nThe Quaids were detained at the Canadian border Friday night while trying to re-enter the United States after Canadian officials said they'd be deported. They're wanted in Santa Barbara, California, to face felony charges filed in 2010 after they were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned. \nOn Monday, the \"Independence Day\" actor argued unsuccessfully for lower bail, saying his legal woes were the fault of a bail bondsman who failed to notify him of a scheduled court appearance. \nQuaid had been scheduled to also be arraigned Monday on a fugitive from justice charge but the proceeding was postponed because California courts were closed and lawyers couldn't get the required paperwork. \nHis wife, Evi Quaid, was arraigned earlier and held on $500,000 bail.
