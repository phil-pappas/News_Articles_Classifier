Dickens and Vaillancourt are two names that are synonymous with Christmas. Through his immortal story, A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens created a story that has stood the test of time through celebrating the spirit of the true meaning of Christmas. It is only fitting that Vaillancourt Folk Art take the industry lead in creating a high-quality product that translates this meaning into something of fine art quality.\nThe A Christmas Carol Ornament Collection depicts the familiar story and characters of Dickens' classic story translated into mouth-blown Polish glass ornaments designed by Judi Vaillancourt with historic detail inspired by Arthur Rackham's interpretation of Charles Dickens immortal words.\nCustomers can bring the tradition of Christmas and its meaning to their home this season with a highly limited first edition batch of ornaments that will be made available at the Vaillancourt Folk Art Sutton, MA retail studios beginning in November. The complete collection will be made available at retail stores around the nation for the 2016 Christmas season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:47:53.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
