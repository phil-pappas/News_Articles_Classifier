Finding fault with ‘San Andreas’ 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Whether you stream, buy or rent, here’s a look at what’s new this week in home video. Movies are available on streaming sites such as iTunes, Amazon and Vudu unless otherwise noted.\nRent it now\n“San Andreas”: State-of-the-art visual effects raise the discomfort level in what is otherwise an old-school Hollywood disaster movie. A series of massive earthquakes turn two great cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, into rubble, with a couple of scenes mimicking iconic 9-11 imagery. But hope is not lost as long as an uncommonly attractive groups of survivors, including Dwayne Johnson and Alexandra Daddario , stay alive and photogenic.\nAlso: “Dope,” “The Gallows,” “Tomorrowland”\nBuy it now\n“Inside Out”: Pixar returns to form with this bittersweet, unclassifiable family film.

A pair of maintenance men, “The Walking Dead’s” Norman Reedus and Djimon Hounson , are automatically awakened for a couple of hours every six months to check on things.
