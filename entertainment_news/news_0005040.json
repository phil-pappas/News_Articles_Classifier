Daniel Craig inspects the UN's demining work in Cyprus In this photo released by the United Nations in Cyprus (UNFICYP) on Tuesday Oct. 13, 2015, the British actor Daniel Craig stands by a UN specialist mine detecting team member at the minefields in UN controlled buffer zone in the divided island of Cyprus. Craig was on Cyprus Tuesday to inspect the United Nations' work to clear minefields, a vestige of conflict that divided this east Mediterranean island along ethnic lines. The U.N. said Craig inspected a live minefield now being cleared by a Cambodian demining team.
