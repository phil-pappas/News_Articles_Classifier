Those attending the Tuesday performance of \"Defamation\" at Kellogg Community College will actually be a part of the action. \nThis courtroom drama by Todd Logan casts the audience as the jury. The performance at the Davidson Visual and Performing Arts Center is just one stop on the play’s sold-out 2015 American tour by Canamac Productions. \nThe trial involves an African-American businesswoman who is suing a Jewish real-estate developer for defamation. He accused her of stealing his watch, which she claims has negatively affected her business. After the witnesses and attorneys have their say, the judge will lead the audience/jury through 15 minutes of deliberations. The jury’s decision determines the outcome. \nIt is a play written with a purpose beyond entertainment. Logan wanted to shed light on how our American culture views race, gender, class and religion. \n“I wanted to write a play that encourages greater tolerance and understanding by spurring self-examination and promoting compelling civil discourse,” Logan said in a press release. \nTo this end, Logan, together with the actors, will lead a discussion with the audience after the show, exploring different reactions to these proceedings. \nDiscussions like these may be uncomfortable, but KCC’s Center for Diversity and Innovation believe they are worth having, which is why CDI is hosting this event. \n“The mission of the Center is to build the capacity of individuals and institutions to implement effective racial equity practices,” said Jorge Zeballos, CDI’s executive director. “What the play is going to do is engage the audience in a conversation that includes race.” \nThis play is just one of many ways CDI is trying to create a more equitable and inclusive Battle Creek. \n“We are trying to reach the community through different types of events, not just one approach,” said Zeballos. “We want to engage through speakers, through films, through workshops, through performances. All those different mediums have different ways to reach people.” \nThis evening of exploratory theater is free to the public. All ages are welcomed, but Zeballos suggests children be of high school age to appreciate the complexities. According to the play’s website, www.defamationtheplay.com, 30,000 people have seen this drama since 2010, with more than 160 performances throughout the United States. Plans for a 2016 tour are already in place. \nFostering community-by-community conversations about race and class is Logan’s motivation. \n“Whether we like it or not, we still have major divides in this country,” Logan wrote on the website. “Most of us still go to bed at night in cities, communities and neighborhoods that are segregated by race, religion, ethnicity and/or class. I wanted to write a play that encourages open, honest conversation that leads to greater understanding and empathy to combat today’s prevailing trends.” \nZeballos hopes \"Defamation\" will spark these honest conversations in Battle Creek. \n“I hope the audience will leave with a deeper understanding of how race and racism influence so many aspects of our society, and that they will take that learning with them in whatever they do.” \n\"Defamation\" starts at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday at Kellogg Community College’s Davidson Visual and Performing Arts Center at 450 North Ave. in Battle Creek. Admission is free. For more information on this and other CDI events, see www.kellogg.edu/kcccdi.
