She sounds a lot like President Barack Obama's new attitude on immigration: If Congress doesn't act, she says, she will.\n\"This epidemic of gun violence,\" the Democratic...\n(Clarence Page) And guns, well, you know. Used in more than 8,000 murders a year in the U.S.\nBoth products are regulated.\nPseudoephedrine medicines are kept behind the counter at pharmacies, and purchases, which require a photo ID from the customer, are entered into a database designed to limit a person in Illinois to 7.5 grams of the active ingredient in 30 days or 3.6 grams in 24 hours (more than in two 20-pill boxes of 12-hour Sudafed). Law enforcement officials use this database to help identify \"smurfs,\" suspiciously frequent purchasers who supply home-based meth labs with raw materials.\nGun purchases are not similarly limited or tracked, though buyers are supposed to have firearm owner's identification cards and in most cases submit to criminal background checks.\nBoth are controversial, and each is represented by a strong lobby.\nEfforts to further curtail customer access to pseudoephedrine run into the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which lobbies on behalf of the palliative manufacturers and purports to defend the interests of law-abiding citizens suffering with cold symptoms. Many states have considered legislation to make pseudoephedrine available by prescription only, but only two — Oregon and Mississippi — have managed to pass such laws. The industry prefers promoting tracking databases that limit purchases and altogether block those convicted of meth-related offenses from buying pseudoephedrine.\nThe gun-makers and gun owners are ably represented by the National Rifle Association, which also invokes the interests of law-abiding citizens when blocking measures to track and limit the purchase of firearms.\nA key difference, of course, is that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to breathe freely through the nose, though it does guarantee the right to keep and bear arms. Accordingly, \"gun control\" looks like a losing cause.\nSo how is \"Sudafed control\" working?\nIllinois State Police Sgt. Don Payton, who oversees enforcement efforts against home methamphetamine labs, offers a mixed view: His figures show that, since last April when the state began preventing known meth criminals from buying pseudoephedrine at retail, the number of blocked purchases of the drug has risen nearly 90 percent, \"while the number of labs is down significantly.\"\nThis decrease in domestic production is a good thing — home meth labs are environmentally toxic and a big fire risk — but, Payton said, in Illinois as elsewhere, Mexican drug cartels have proved very adept at rushing in to fill the void left by diminished availability of pseudoephedrine with mass-produced and even more addictive forms of methamphetamine.\nI asked around about \"meth-blocking technology,\" to which I was introduced over the summer when a pharmacy in West Virginia sold me a spongy form of pseudoephedrine called Zephrex-D, which the box said would \"disrupt meth production\" by preventing 98 percent of the active ingredient from being converted to methamphetamine when common home methods are used.\nIt was launched nationally by Westport Pharmaceuticals of St. Louis in 2013. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wasn't impressed, telling Westport in a letter that its chemists were able to extract meth from Zephrex-D. But Jason Grellner, vice president of the National Narcotics Officers Association, said the DEA tested the product using conversion methods far more sophisticated than those used by most home meth labs, and that his organization's tests suggested that widespread use of the technology in Zephrex-D would all but eliminate the easiest, \"one-pot\" method of meth production.\nScott Melville, CEO of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, offered what looks for now to be the last word on this idea:\n\"Tamper resistant products are an interesting and emerging technology, yet as of today, we are skeptical that the proposals to limit consumer choice in favor of tamper resistant products will have a meaningful impact on the nation's meth problem,\" he said in a statement. \"We should all be committed to fighting the meth problem across the U.S. without restricting consumers' choice to the medications they rely on.\"\nThose terrible Cubs towels\nWhat next, fellow Cubs fans? The wave?\nToo many of you in the stands at Wrigley Field have been swirling towels over your heads, borrowing an annoying tradition from fans elsewhere.\nPittsburgh Steelers fans are widely credited with starting the towel-swirling trend in 1975 (though the Denver Broncos say the idea started with their \"Orange Sunday\" ritual in 1971) and it has since spread to many corners of the sporting universe, notably to Minnesota where the Twins introduced the \"Homer Hanky\" in 1987.\nTeam lore says that black cats are bad luck. So are copycats.\nFetal attraction\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this month that at an event in the nation's capital, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told gathered law enforcement officials, \"We have allowed our police department to get fetal and it is having a direct consequence. They have pulled back from the ability to interdict ... they don't want to be a news story themselves, they don't want their career ended early, and it's having an impact.\"\nFetal?\nIn no dictionary I can find is the word \"fetal\" synonymous with \"tentative\" or \"overly cautious,\" which context tells us is the idea Emanuel was attempting to convey.\nThe \"fetal position\" is the curled up, inert posture of a baby in the womb, and one adopts it to suggest total helplessness and despair — small wonder that police officers took offense at this description of their response to the increasing likelihood that everything they do in public will end up on YouTube.\nThe truth is that the inevitability that police interactions with civilians will be visually recorded will end up being a boon to law enforcement by reducing frivolous complaints, weeding out bad cops and building the trust necessary to fight crime at the community level.\nThe promise of such a future is still, well, embryonic. But it's growing by the day.\nComments: chicagotribune.com/zorn\nTwitter @ericzorn\n Chicago Cubs National Rifle Association of America Minnesota Twins Commentary Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562172c7/turbine/ct-meth-sudafed-zorn-gun-control-nra-dea-perspec-1018-jm-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56140a7c/turbine/ct-gun-control-clinton-oregon-shooting-clarence-page-perspec-1007-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:18:18.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
