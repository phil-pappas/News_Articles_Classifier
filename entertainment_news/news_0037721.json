Love Ranch owner Dennis Hof recently told CNN that Odom was \"in a good frame of mind\" when he was taken to the brothel, and that he ate and slept well there. \n\"He picked a couple of girls, and he had the time of his life,\" Hof said. \nIn three days at the brothel, Odom spent $75,000, which guaranteed two women would \"take care of any of his needs,\" Hof told CNN's sister network HLN. \nEmployees told 911 dispatchers that Odom used cocaine on Saturday -- his first day at the brothel -- though Hof insisted Saturday that any drug use happened when Odom was partying early that morning in Las Vegas but before he'd arrived at the Love Ranch. \n\"I'm going to protect my business, and I'm not going to let the world say that Lamar was doing a lot of drugs in my place,\" he told CNN's Michael Smerconish, insisting his brothel has \"zero tolerance\" for illicit drugs. \"Because it makes him look bad, and he wasn't doing that.\" \nA woman said she also saw Odom take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days. \nThe brothel's employees said when they found him, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. \n'More hopeful now' \nLate last week, Odom woke up and spoke for the first time, saying \"Hi\" to Kardashian, who had rushed to his bedside. \nHarrick said that he's been in touch with her every day. Odom spoke to her Monday, the coach said, telling her \"Good morning!\" before going back to sleep. \n\"We're more hopeful now\" that Odom will recover, Harrick said. \"We've been on pins and needles for days.\" \nOdom's maternal aunt, JaNean Mercer, also commented on Monday. She released a written statement which said, \"Lamar has always been blessed with a tenacious, fighting spirit, overcoming insurmountable obstacles to achieve the impossible. These past few days have been no different.\" \nHe is \"defying the odds in his toughest battle to date\" with \"God's grace,\" she said. \nShe added, \"We are committed to remaining by his side as a family for our champion, who we love immensely.\" \nKardashian a 'rock' \nHarrick was at Kardashian and Odom's 2009 wedding. They filed for divorce four years later, citing irreconcilable differences. \nHarrick got to know Kardashian. \n\"I just come to fall in love with her,\" he said. \"She's a sweet, loving, lovely young girl. I think she's a rock. She's the best thing that ever happened (to Odom).\" \nHarrick said he wanted to \"go over there\" and \"smack him\" to let him know how incredible she is. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:46:31.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
