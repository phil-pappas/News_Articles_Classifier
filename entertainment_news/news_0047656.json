Valparaiso Events’ Fall Harvest Festival does just that. \nThis festival kicks off on Friday each year with trick or treating at the various businesses located in downtown Valparaiso. Trick or treaters are encouraged to dress up in their best costumes and enjoy the treats and fun throughout the downtown area. The fun doesn’t stop at the treats and costumes, there are free hay rides provided by the Valparaiso Parks Department and over 30 vendors set up around the courthouse square and Central Park Plaza to provide even more treats. \nClick here to see more photos from the Fall Harvest Festival. \nAn event like this could not be successful without the help of the sponsors such as Rolling Hills Vineyard church. The job of sponsors is to provide the event with things such as hot chocolate or coffee candy and other things to help the event. Mac McElhaney, Lead Pastor of Rolling Hills Vineyard church explained why the church is so eager to participate in this event. \n“We want to participate because Valparaiso Events does a really nice job at making sure there is something for the whole family.” Said McElhaney. “It’s a safe environment and there are a lot of police on site, I feel like most communities don’t get what we get for free.” \nThere is no place quite like downtown Valpo. Among those in attendance Kristine Masty, and her friends explained how much they enjoy bringing their kids out. \n“It’s family friendly and the kids love, all the businesses participate which is great,” added Masty. \nAlthough it’s about the yummy treats that are handed out some groups trick or treat a little differently. Malika Saxena and Brooke Mcklen of Valparaiso High Schools UNICEF club explained their style of trick or treating. \n“This is our first big event of the year, so basically we’ve just been going around asking for donations, so instead of candy we ask for money,” said the girls. “All that money will then be sent to UNICEF.” \nThe Fall Harvest Festival continues on Saturday in downtown Valpo. It is easy to understand why the festival is only getting larger and people are remaining pleased with it. From hay rides and free hot chocolate to the exotic costumes and free candy, it’s no surprise this festival is getting nothing but good reviews. The only tricks here are the trick to having a good time with the entire family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:39:45.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
