I went up the mountain and watched some of the race. Bathurst is the mecca for car racing so for me to experience that while people are racing there, we were very fortunate.”\nBrock was killed in Perth in 2006 when he lost control of his car in the Targa West Rally and hit a tree. He was aged 61.\nDrivers Peter Brock (R) & Allan Moffatt in 1986 Motor Racing P/ Also in the cast are Ella Scott Lynch as his wife, Bev, Natalie Bassingthwaighte as Julie Bamford and Steve Bisley as Harry Firth. Production will begin next week with Brock set to air on Ten next year.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

There are many aspects and facets to him as a person and we hope to really introduce this legend and this awesome man to a whole new generation of people.”\nIn terms of physical transformations, Le Nevez has had to slim down.\n“Peter was a very health conscious and lean man,” he said. “I’ve been in LA trying to strip down a few kilos and stay out of the gym.”", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1fe5808c1fabfee4cdb7d81b3ed3f502?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:13:29.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
