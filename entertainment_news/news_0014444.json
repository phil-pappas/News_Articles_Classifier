It was testimony which contradicted two other witnesses who told jurors Tan was distraught that day, and seems to contradict Anna Valentine's own statements to the media just after Tan's arrest.\nThe murder trial is now in its fourth week — and the fifth day of jury deliberations.\nThe jury in the second-degree murder trial were sent home for the weekend on Friday after not reaching a verdict in the case of the 20-year-old former Pittsford Mendon High School student class president and Cornell student accused of fatally shooting his father, Liang \"Jim\" Tan, in February.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nAndreatta: A Tan mistrial would prove nothing\nValentine's testimony painted a different picture of Charles Tan's demeanor than the testimony delivered by his Cornell football coach, Terry Cullen, with whom he met about 10 a.m. Feb. 5, and another Pittsford friend, Jacob Grossman, with whom he met about 10 p.m.\nCullen testified that Charles Tan told him he was upset, told Cullen he was going to miss practice the next day, and Cullen offered him a ride from Cornell to Pittsford. Grossman said his friend seemed depressed, asked him how much money he had, told him he might be leaving the country the next day. Grossman called 911 out of concern for his friend, he testified.\nValentine testified she met with Charles Tan and some other friends between 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. at her apartment on the RIT campus, where they discussed plans for an internship she was considering.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nComplete coverage: Charles Tan murder trial\nHer description of Charles Tan during her testimony — that he was \"normal, happy\" and \"nothing out of the ordinary\" contradicted statements she made to the Democrat and Chronicle and other media outlets that Charles Tan was not himself on Feb. 5, that he seemed unusually stressed and distracted.\nValentine said she grew concerned when Tan sent her a text message the following day that read: \"I love you and will talk to you soon,\" but she was unable to reach him after that.\nDefense lawyer James Nobles, who called Valentine to the stand as a defense witness, said he was unaware of Valentine's statements to the media.\nAssistant District Attorney William Gargan, who was aware of Valentine's public statements in February, explained the apparent contradictions this way:\n\"Questions to media are sometimes different from questions from law enforcement,\" he said. \"I think it's clear Anna has been a dear friend to Charlie, and I think she, like any dear friend to anybody, would want that person to ensure they are in the best view in the jury's mind. I'm hoping that it was self-evident to the jury that the experience with Anna was qualitatively different from the other people who were there.\"\nOtherwise, it was mostly a quiet morning on Monday with no other notes from jurors. And after the jury heard Valentine's testimony again, court recessed for lunch.\nADA Bill Gargan on why Anna Valentine's testimony contradicted her statements to media. #tantrial pic.twitter.com/CXhuVKzCup\n— Jon Hand (@jonhand1) October 5, 2015 Charles Tan spent his birthday Saturday awaiting the jury's decision in the case in which he faces a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of 25 years to life if convicted.\nConversation outside the courtroom has included the possibility of a hung jury — one which cannot reach a unanimous verdict — and a mistrial.\nUpdates: Jon Hand tweets from court\nTweets by @jonhand1 Friday marked the end of the third week of the trial which has consisted of six days of jury selection, five days of prosecution witness testimony, 90 minutes of defense testimony, and roughly 3 ½ days of deliberation.\nThe jury requested some testimony and evidence — including a much-listened to 911 call — to be replayed for them Friday, which indicated to some that they were still a functioning jury.\n\"Most of their requests have been for something new and that is certainly encouraging in my opinion,\" Nobles said Friday, adding he had concerns about the jury being let go for the weekend.\n\"I never like to see a jury go home for the weekend. I think that's too much time frankly to see what [the media is] putting out and be interfered with by other people.\"\nGargan said Friday he believes the jury is still working together\n\"Anybody who has been in the courthouse in the past knows there have been juries who have expressed to the court that they are deadlocked, that they are having difficulty. We haven't had that at all,\" Gargan said.\nIndeed, the jury has not announced to County Court Judge James Piampiano that they are deadlocked. If they do, it's expected Piampiano would issue an Allen charge — a directive to continue deliberating to avoid having to have a new trial.\nThe jury of 10 women and two men have learned from prosecution witnesses that Charles Tan was despondent on Feb. 5 while at Cornell, attempted to buy a shotgun at a Cortland Walmart and later had his friend buy it for him, then drove to Rochester, where he visited friends.\nHe is accused of shooting his father sometime between 8:40 p.m. that day — the last time Liang Tan is believed to have communicated with anyone via email — and Feb. 9, when Charles Tan's mother, Qing \"Jean\" Tan called 911 and told a dispatcher her son shot her husband while he was trying to protect her. That call was the recording jurors requested Friday.\nDeputy Christopher Cooper testified he asked Charles Tan where his father was and he responded that his father was inside the house, upstairs, that he was dead and that \"he had to do it\" because his father was going to kill his mother.\nThe jury also heard a Jan. 28 phone call from Qing Tan to 911 in which she told a dispatcher her husband had attacked her and she needed police protection. Liang Tan is heard taking the phones and is dismissive of the incident, and tells his wife she is being \"childish.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nCharles Tan case timeline: When was his father killed?\nThat was the only incident of domestic violence discussed during the trial. Many had expected the defense to focus on an alleged long history of domestic violence in the Tan home as a possible justification for the shooting of Liang Tan. Sheriff's officials have acknowledged they went to the home about 17 times since 2003, though they have not divulged the nature of those visits.\nInstead, Nobles in his closing argument to jurors suggested Qing Tan shot her husband as she had the \"ability, motive and opportunity\" to do so.\nGargan asked that the judge to direct the jury that they could find Charles Tan guilty as an accomplice if they believe Qing Tan fired the shotgun, but Piampiano denied the request, determining at trial that the prosecution did not include that possibility.\nAnd because there were no other charges in the indictment, that leaves the single charge — second-degree murder — and the two aspects of it — that Charles Tan intended to kill his father and did kill his father — to be decided by jurors.\nJHAND@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nKey audio clips in the Charles Tan murder trial", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jonhand1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e2af4b5832292a7f9b1e1c325179e6e13e3e871/c=700-0-4019-3319/local/-/media/2015/09/22/Rochester/Rochester/635785215169157771-Tan7.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a8d36e5f3e152327b9fe0870d050c3bd5a64d59c/c=0-129-766-895/local/-/media/2015/09/23/Rochester/Rochester/635786206380416336-IMG-3914.JPG", "http://t.co/CXhuVKzCup", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/tantrial?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/jonhand1/status/651073354938613760", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d84b5bd030d10b1d0f5b80e2fefc27b19909385/c=0-0-4716-2664&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/22/Rochester/Rochester/635785215169157771-Tan7.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31d97d4495b6de51a4c783c628ca2c27a0cdd283/c=52-0-562-510/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793630253520113-Charles-Tan-Leaves-Court.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:36:15.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
