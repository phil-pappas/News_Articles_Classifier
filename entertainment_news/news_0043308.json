It was titled \"The Pianist of Willesden Lane\" and my colleague Chris Jones was there. He wrote a review after this opening night performance, calling the play \"a deeply stirring new one-woman show about the life of a Jewish musician who played on through turmoil, adversity and dislocation, relied heavily on the kindness of others and whose art literally saved her life.\"\nKogan Sidewalks Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Chicago Public and Catholic school teachers, including Budlong Elementary School teachers (L to R) Margo Taylor, Madison Brake, and Kate Hinken prepare to learn more about concert pianist Mona Golabek and her inspirational book, \"The Children of Willesden Lane\" at Wells High School in Chicago, Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015.\nChicago Public and Catholic school teachers, including Budlong Elementary School teachers (L to R) Margo Taylor, Madison Brake, and Kate Hinken prepare to learn more about concert pianist Mona Golabek and her inspirational book, \"The Children of Willesden Lane\" at Wells High School in Chicago, Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015.\n(Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) And now, as does the play, let's travel to 1938 and meet Golabek's mother, whose name was Lisa Jura. She was a 14-year-old musical prodigy living in Vienna with dreams of becoming a concert pianist. But Hitler's armies were on the move and Lisa's parents had to make a wrenching decision. Able to get safe passage to London for but one of their three daughters, they chose Lisa and off she went alone, to a hostel on Willesden Lane, where her music would offer some bright light for the other displaced children there in a world gone quite dark and mad.\n\"The clack-clack of the antiaircraft guns was the next indication that this was not a false alarm,\" Golabek and Cohen write in their book. \"The drone of the approaching bombers got louder and louder, then bursts of white smoke appeared high in the sky. … The London Blitz had begun.\"\nAnd so now, back to April 2013 when Golabek proved, to Jones' mind \"as formidable a pianist as she is a storyteller.\" One of the other people in the packed theater that night was Jason Brett, a fixture on the local creative arts scene for decades as an actor, producer, impresario (he co-founded the Apollo Theatre), moviemaker (he co-produced the film \"About Last Night\") and entrepreneur.\nOne man travels Ireland's road to independence, in song Rick Kogan For hundreds of years and for hundreds of thousands of people, Chicago has provided a welcoming, comfortable and nurturing home for those who trace their roots (their hearts and souls) to Ireland.\nOne of these people is Paddy Homan, the map of his native County Cork on his broad/happy face and...\nFor hundreds of years and for hundreds of thousands of people, Chicago has provided a welcoming, comfortable and nurturing home for those who trace their roots (their hearts and souls) to Ireland.\nOne of these people is Paddy Homan, the map of his native County Cork on his broad/happy face and...\n(Rick Kogan) \"I just had to meet this extraordinary person,\" Brett says. \"First, I had to compose myself, I was so moved. I went backstage and shook her hand. I did not know anything about her foundation then but I felt how empowering this work, her mother's story was, and I wanted to be part of whatever journey she was going on.\"\nBrett was recounting this after talking to a bunch of Chicago schoolteachers at Wells High School in the West Town neighborhood on a sweltering late afternoon in early September.\nThe teachers were there for a few hours of professional development sessions, conducted enthusiastically by Brett and some people from Facing History and Ourselves ( www.facinghistory.org ), the international program that uses history to help high school students deal with modern-day prejudices and intolerance. The teachers were learning how they could facilitate discussions and create activities in their classrooms about \"The Children of Willesden Lane.\" Brett was talking specifically about his creation, MashPlant ( www.mashplant.com ), a web-based content sharing platform that allows students to create projects related to a story and share them across classrooms and schools here and around the world. For this specific project he has created the Community of Willesden Lane ( www.willesdenlane.mashplant.com ).\n\"This is an education technology, seemingly unrelated to everything I had done before,\" says Brett. \"But working with Mona and the foundation I started to understand that it really is what I have always been doing, connecting the dots to create community, telling and showing stories in a safe and supportive place, and allowing that to create a ripple effect.\"\n\"Hold On To Your Music Foundation\" began in 2003 to, Golabek says, \"spread messages about identity, moral responsibility, tolerance, and artistic appreciation.\"\nIt has been successfully conducted in such cities as Canton, Ohio; Scranton, Penn.; Montgomery and Birmingham, Ala.; Memphis; and Los Angeles. And now it is coming here — funded by private and public sources — and soon to other cities across the globe. Its principal local partners are Mash Plant, Facing History and Ourselves and Urban Gateways ( www.urbangateways.org ), the venerable and increasingly essential nonprofit organization that provides arts programs and artists for schools, families and communities.\nIt makes for a potent team. In addition to providing the free books and professional development sessions, students will attend daytime matinee performances by Golabek on Oct. 28, 29 or 30 at the Harris Theater; the Chicago Public Library system will place \"The Children of Willesden Lane\" on suggested reading lists and hold a special author's event; a public benefit performance will take place 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 29 at the Harris ( www.harristheaterchicago.org ), with members of the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra performing with Golabek, all of it recorded for later national and international broadcasts through the WFMT Chicago Radio Network.\n\"I am overwhelmed by the positive response and the plans,\" says Golabek.\nThere is one teacher in one school who has been using the book in her classrooms for two years and is into a third. Her name is Tani Prell, and she used the book the past two years in performing arts classes for sophomores and this year in theater classes for freshmen. She works at Muchin College Prep in the heart of the Loop.\nThe school was founded by Allan and Elaine Muchin and it was he who introduced Prell to the book and to Golabek.\n\"It is such a wonderful story,\" says Prell, in her third year of teaching. \"I love the book and the kids have been so enthusiastic about it. Most are the about the same age as was Lisa in the book and so can relate to her and also make some powerful connections.\n\"There are so many positive messages about obligation, being true to yourself and overcoming obstacles, gaining confidence. The book spurs great conversations.\"\nThe entire school, about 860 students, is scheduled to attend one of three matinee performances this month.\n\"The book and the story hold the possibility of being life-altering experiences,\" says Prell.\nOne never knows now, does one? The world is a harsh place for so many. But one does hope.\nSo, let's allow Hershey Felder the last word. He is the Canadian pianist, actor, playwright, composer, producer, and director who has performed here and elsewhere in one-man shows focusing on the life and work of such people as Chopin, Beethoven, George Gershwin and Irving Berlin. He returns to the Royal George in a few weeks for another run of his Berlin show and indeed will orchestrate the theater's entire 2015-16 season. More importantly, for this story, it was he who shaped, adapted and directed Golabek's show for the stage.\nHe says: \"In Mona there is a deep sense and visceral understanding of continuum, the enduring continuum of the human spirit and of the need for beauty, for art; the salvation that art is the very thing that makes us human. I can't think of a better way to introduce (or reinforce) young minds and hearts to the notion of what it means to exist, to feel, to be part not just of a class of kids going to school because they have to, but to be part of this continuum of humanity; that there is direct impact of what goes on before us, our parents, our grandparents, our forefathers and mothers, and ultimately how we ourselves fit into the world. Above all, this is a story of commitment: don't let go, don't give up. Beauty and joy and fulfillment will come to you as long as you pursue it relentlessly.\"\nNow there is a great message for this messy time in which so many children must live.\n\"After Hours With Rick Kogan\" airs 9-11 p.m. Sundays on WGN-AM 720.\nrkogan@tribune.com\nTwitter @rickkogan\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Rick Kogan Entertainment Chicago Public Library Theater", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612ee7c/turbine/ct-singer-paddy-homan-i-am-ireland-ent-1006-20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617c469/turbine/ct-ae-1011-kogan-sidewalks-20151008-002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617c463/turbine/ct-ae-1011-kogan-sidewalks-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:38:36.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
