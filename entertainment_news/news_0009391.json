But he has since appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" and agreed to several interviews with NBC News programs. \nHis return to 30 Rockefeller Center for \"SNL\" is sure to garner even more attention. \nTrump has hosted \"SNL\" once before, on April 3, 2004. \nThis time Trump will be live from New York alongside musical guest Sia. \nThe new season of \"SNL\" started two weekends ago. Trump's rival on the Democratic side of the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, made a cameo during the premiere. \nTrump had been expected to pop up the same way -- possibly as a surprise guest sometime this fall -- but not necessarily as a host. \nLast month he was uncharacteristically coy when CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked him, \"Has 'SNL' asked you to go on this season? Would you consider it?\" \nHe answered cryptically: \"I'm not allowed to say that.\" \nShe pressed: \"Because... you're in negotiations with them?\" And he said: \"I'm just not allowed to say it. I mean, I have -- uh -- silencio. I can't speak about it.\" \nAs the host, Trump will have a chance to interact with the \"SNL\" comedian who has been playing him this season, Taran Killam. Trump tweeted approvingly about the impression on October 3. \nTrump retweeted a user during the show who said, \"@Taran Killam plays a way better fake @realDonaldTrump than a real @HillaryClinton plays herself.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:16:15.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
