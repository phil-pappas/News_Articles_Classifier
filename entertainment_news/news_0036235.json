Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale Agree on Final Terms of Divorce 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nGwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale did not have a prenuptial agreement and have agreed on the final terms of their divorce, TMZ reports. \nBecause they did not have a prenup, Rossdale is entitled to 50 percent of their joint assets, but agreed to take \"far less\" than that in order to reach a speedy settlement. In addition, the couple has settled on joint custody of their three sons - Kingston, 9; Zuma, 7; and Apollo, 1 -- but Rossdale will actually be taking care of the children most of the time due to Stefani's touring schedule. \nBush frontman Rossdale and No Doubt lead singer Stefani were married in 2002 and Stefani filed for divorce earlier this year, citing irreconcilable differences. Their split is expected to be finalized by the end of the year. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:45:30.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
