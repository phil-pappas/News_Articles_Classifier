They wish to do this for many reasons including, but not limited to: seeking and sharing information as to who is on the ballot, memorializing that they have voted and who they have voted for so that they can discuss this at a later time, and encouraging friends and family to vote and who to vote for.\"\nBarker sided with the ACLU, saying the state failed to demonstrate a need for the ban.\n\"The State has entirely failed to identify any such problem in Indiana relating to or evidencing vote buying, voter fraud, voter coercion, involuntary ballot disclosures, or an existing threat to the integrity of the electoral process,\" Barker said in her ruling.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742548&h=Indiana+judge+overturns+ban+on+%27ballot+selfies%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742548", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1742548&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:14:17.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
