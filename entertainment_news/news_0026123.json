Stine's popular book series, took first place in its debut with $23.6 million, beating Steven Spielberg's Cold War thriller \"Bridge of Spies\" and Guillermo del Toro's gothic romance \"Crimson Peak.\"\n\"Goosebumps\" also ended the chart-topping reign of Ridley Scott's \"The Martian.\" Its $21.3 million weekend earned the film the second-place box office spot and bumped its domestic total to an otherworldly $143.6 million.\n\"Bridge of Spies,\" which reunites Spielberg with Tom Hanks, opened in third place with $15.4 million. It's the worst debut for the pairing to date, but older audiences could eventually help the well-reviewed movie, which cost a modest $40 million to produce.\n\"Crimson Peak\" also failed to attract a significant opening weekend audience. The R-rated horror film brought in a scarily low $13.1 million and will likely drop off significantly after poor audience reception. Legendary produced the film for $55 million.\nThe top 20 movies at U.S. and Canadian theaters Friday through Sunday, followed by distribution studio, gross, number of theater locations, average receipts per location, total gross and number of weeks in release, as compiled Monday by Rentrak:\n1. \"Goosebumps,\" Sony, $23,618,556, 3,501 locations, $6,746 average, $23,618,556, 1 week.\n2. \"The Martian,\" 20th Century Fox, $21,300,120, 3,701 locations, $5,755 average, $143,595,778, 3 weeks.\nView gallery In this image released by Disney, Tom Hanks, from right, Mark Rylance and Billy Magnusson appear in  … 3. \"Bridge Of Spies,\" Disney, $15,371,203, 2,811 locations, $5,468 average, $15,371,203, 1 week.\n4. \"Crimson Peak,\" Universal, $13,143,310, 2,984 locations, $4,405 average, $13,143,310, 1 week.\n5. \"Hotel Transylvania 2,\" Sony, $12,645,773, 3,533 locations, $3,579 average, $136,805,161, 4 weeks.\n6. \"Pan,\" Warner Bros., $5,863,128, 3,515 locations, $1,668 average, $25,741,311, 2 weeks.\n7. \"The Intern,\" Warner Bros., $5,447,297, 2,707 locations, $2,012 average, $58,773,279, 4 weeks.\n8. \"Sicario,\" Lionsgate, $4,557,480, 2,130 locations, $2,140 average, $34,720,093, 5 weeks.\n9. \"Woodlawn,\" Pure Flix, $4,002,226, 1,553 locations, $2,577 average, $4,002,226, 1 week.\nView gallery In this image released by Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures, Mia Wasikowska, appears in a sc … 10. \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,\" 20th Century Fox, $2,856,842, 1,967 locations, $1,452 average, $75,518,812, 5 weeks.\n11. \"Steve Jobs,\" Universal, $1,512,693, 60 locations, $25,212 average, $2,223,174, 2 weeks.\n12. \"MET Opera: Otello (2015),\" Fathom Events, $1,300,000, 900 locations, $1,444 average, $1,300,000, 1 week.\n13. \"Black Mass,\" Warner Bros., $1,277,349, 1,055 locations, $1,211 average, $60,229,131, 5 weeks.\n14. \"Everest,\" Universal, $1,211,680, 950 locations, $1,275 average, $40,789,835, 5 weeks.\n15. \"The Walk,\" Sony, $1,203,857, 2,489 locations, $484 average, $9,178,163, 3 weeks.\n16. \"The Visit,\" Universal, $1,158,340, 1,068 locations, $1,085 average, $63,082,305, 6 weeks.\n17. \"War Room,\" Sony, $928,139, 799 locations, $1,162 average, $65,400,751, 8 weeks.\n18. \"Ladrones,\" Lionsgate, $671,419, 375 locations, $1,790 average, $2,438,572, 2 weeks.\n19. \"The Perfect Guy,\" Sony, $621,311, 485 locations, $1,281 average, $55,825,610, 6 weeks.\n20. \"Inside Out,\" Disney, $365,488, 276 locations, $1,324 average, $354,935,066, 18 weeks.\n---\nUniversal and Focus are owned by NBC Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.; Sony, Columbia, Sony Screen Gems and Sony Pictures Classics are units of Sony Corp.; Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc.; Disney, Pixar and Marvel are owned by The Walt Disney Co.; Miramax is owned by Filmyard Holdings LLC; 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight are owned by 21st Century Fox; Warner Bros. and New Line are units of Time Warner Inc.; MGM is owned by a group of former creditors including Highland Capital, Anchorage Advisors and Carl Icahn; Lionsgate is owned by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; IFC is owned by AMC Networks Inc.; Rogue is owned by Relativity Media LLC.\nMedia Arts & Entertainment 20th Century Fox Goosebumps Steven Spielberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:05.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
