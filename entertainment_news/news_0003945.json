Daley first laid out in 2001, featuring six parallel runways, was hailed as a game changer that would transform delay-plagued O'Hare from a holding pen for stranded passengers to a reliable airport.\nYet the performance goals set almost 15 years ago — cutting delays in bad weather by 95 percent and delays overall by 79 percent — seem to be as elusive as ever.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, O'Hare's on-time departure rate fell a whopping 10 percentage points — to an abysmal 67 percent — despite dealing with 8 percent fewer flights, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Delays no doubt contribute to O'Hare's lousy reputation with fliers.O'Hare ranked 92nd out of 100 airports worldwide in a recent rating by Skytrax.\nSo are O'Hare travelers stuck? Does the very nature of the airport as a crucial, busy hub in the nation's air-traffic system mean it will always be the poster child of air-travel woes? Not necessarily. A Tribune analysis of reams of flight data, as well as interviews with aviation experts and federal and airline officials pointed to five key steps that could boost the likelihood in the future that your flight will be on time.\n\"My experience is that O'Hare is always congested, but I'd say about half of my trips (through the airport) go without much of a hitch,'' said Karen Miller, 49, a businesswoman who lives near Oklahoma City and frequently connects through O'Hare. \"The problem I would like to see solved is the lack of consistency. I never know what side of the bed O'Hare will wake up on.''\nMore traffic, more problems for O'Hare Alex Bordens and Geoff Hing It’s no secret that the more passengers and planes funneling through one airport, the higher the chance for delays.

It’s no secret that the more passengers and planes funneling through one airport, the higher the chance for delays. Thanks to expansion O'Hare International Airport finds itself at the extreme for both, ranking at or near the bottom in on-time performance and in the top three in volume among major... (Alex Bordens and Geoff Hing) Settle issue of future runways, terminals\nChicago's new aviation chief calls O'Hare's myriad challenges \"good problems to have,'' and she asks the flying public for patience because the runway expansion project is not completed and even troublesome data about flight delays and congestion point to the strong demand for air travel through the nation's transportation hub.\nBut the two airlines that dominate service at O'Hare disagree about finishing the O'Hare Modernization Program. And they aren't even fully on board that significantly fewer delays and less congestion are compatible with the increasing number of planes and passengers that the carriers and the city hope will be routed through the airport.\nThe city, which is effectively the landlord at O'Hare, wields considerable leverage to apply pressure on winning airline approval for a range of capital improvements at the airport as well as persuading the airlines to fine-tune their schedules to help customers get to where they are going on time. The airlines' current master agreements at O'Hare, covering landing fees, terminal rents and policies on whether aircraft gates are shared by multiple airlines or controlled by a single carrier, expire in 2018. The city's ability to negotiate a new long-term master agreement presents a prime opportunity to implement changes in many areas that would help O'Hare to become more reliable and traveler-friendly.\nSouthwest controls Midway's fate Gregory Karp and Jon Hilkevitch O'Hare isn't the only Chicago airport with on-time woes, as Midway Airport often joins its big brother near the bottom of the heap among large airports.\nIn June, for example, Midway was dead last for on-time departures among 29 large U.S. airports that report on-time data to the U.S. Department...\nO'Hare isn't the only Chicago airport with on-time woes, as Midway Airport often joins its big brother near the bottom of the heap among large airports.\nIn June, for example, Midway was dead last for on-time departures among 29 large U.S. airports that report on-time data to the U.S. Department...\n(Gregory Karp and Jon Hilkevitch) Critics of the O'Hare plan say the parallel-runway format, which has worked successfully at airports from Dallas to Denver, is a bad fit for O'Hare because of factors ranging from the airport's tight footprint to Chicago's variable weather. But with the city having already spent $8.7 billion on the O'Hare project, there is little likelihood of changing directions now.\nStill, some members of the Illinois congressional delegation have called for a halt to further expansion pending an independent forensic audit of the costs and benefits to date of the project. Elements of the final, unfunded phase of the project include one more east-west parallel runway, extension of an existing runway and construction of a passenger terminal on the west side of the airport.\n\"Before the first shovel hit the ground on O'Hare expansion 10 years ago, this airport was busier and as efficient or more efficient than it is now,\" said U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat whose district includes neighborhoods greatly affected by jet noise from O'Hare. \"That's what's frustrating. The city and the FAA made significant promises about improving performance in bad weather. They cannot show me a statistic showing that it is better. What I keep hearing is, 'Trust us.'''\nRather than go along with the city's plan to complete the project, Quigley said: \"This is as good a time as any to take a step back, analyze where we are and ask ourselves what is the right next step? The worst thing that you can do is to build upon a mistake and condemn a generation of fliers to live with it.\"\nUnder new leadership, the Chicago Department of Aviation is vowing that by 2020 it will finish the runway project that was originally scheduled for completion in 2012 and today is not quite two-thirds of the way done. United and American have refused to invest in a sixth parallel runway that the city hopes to open in 2020, an extension of an existing runway in 2021 or a proposed western passenger terminal housing approximately 50 aircraft gates.\n\"O'Hare needs to be competitive with Atlanta, Denver and Dallas-Ft. Worth, all of whom have a parallel runway system,'' Chicago Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans said.\nWhen the runway project is completed, O'Hare will be able to handle up to 284 takeoffs and landings per hour in good weather, as opposed to 222 today, Evans said. The airport's performance in poor weather will improve to the equivalent of current good-weather rates, she said. When asked why O'Hare's on-time arrival and departure performance is at the bottom of the heap among busy airports as measured by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Evans pointed to recent reductions in \"FAA-related delays,'' which she said indicates a promising trend.\nBuild more aircraft gates\nThe O'Hare overhaul lacks balance between airfield improvements and terminal expansion. It is apparent on the airfield, where 70 percent of flights either take off or land to the west, while only 30 percent of flights are on an east flow, as well as at the passenger terminals, where gate space is at a premium.\nFor every 10 flights that arrived at O'Hare or departed last year, more than three were late on average, according to data reported to the U.S. DOT. Some flights that land early end up becoming a delay statistic because pilots must wait for gates.\n\"Even on beautiful sunny days, we have to put planes in the penalty box (holding area) because there aren't enough gates to park and unload the passengers,'' said an air traffic controller at O'Hare tower who asked not to be identified. \"You are adding capacity to the airport (by building the parallel-runway system), but no. 1, they've got to fix the gate issue. Build them and we'll use 'em.''\nFlights arriving late at O'Hare's gates have more than tripled in the last five years, according to Federal Aviation Administration data. The delay per airplane averaged 3.2 minutes in 2009. It increased to 5.4 minutes in 2011 and 6.7 minutes in 2013, then skyrocketed to 11.5 minutes in 2014, the FAA reported.\nEvans is the first aviation commissioner in about 15 years to agree that more gates are needed. She said that while the annual number of flights at O'Hare has stabilized in recent years, gate shortages crop up at peak periods of each weekday and during the busiest travel seasons. A contributing factor is that the airlines are flying bigger planes, resulting in a net loss of parking positions within the central terminal area, said a report that Evans released this past summer.\n\"Our constraint has moved from the airfield to the gate area,'' Evans said in an interview. She said discussions with the airlines are underway to build 12 new gates — six each at two so far undisclosed locations — by about 2018. It will take longer to develop a comprehensive plan for additional gates, she said, declining to specify how many gates O'Hare would need over the long haul.\n\"If we had two dozen more gates today, they would be fully utilized, no question,'' Evans said.\nO'Hare, which last year handled more flights than any other airport in the world, has 188 gates, according to the city Aviation Department. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is the busiest airport based on total passengers and over the first eight months of 2015 ranked No. 2 out of 29 U.S. airports for on-time arrivals, operates 207 gates.\nAmerican and United have long opposed Chicago's original plan to build the western terminal campus that would house about 50 gates. The two carriers say the plan is operationally dysfunctional, because it would complicate the transfer of passengers and baggage between planes parked at the main terminals and the western terminal. Less than half of O'Hare passengers start and end their trips in the Chicago region. Most passengers connect through O'Hare.\nBut American and United's resistance to a whole new terminal packed with gates is also linked to the carriers' concerns about the cost and that competitors, particularly low-cost airlines that offer discounted airfares, would use some of the new gate capacity, according to aviation experts.\nImprove FAA air-traffic control system\nSome of the reasons for O'Hare's poor on-time flight record are outside the direct control of the Chicago Department of Aviation, or they are considered acceptable problems because O'Hare is in a class of its own. The airline hub-and-spoke system, which basically funnels passengers flying on smaller planes from small and medium-sized airports to board larger planes at hub airports where they continue on to their final destinations, is built on the premise that significant congestion and delay are unavoidable.\nIt's more inconvenience than most passengers would prefer, but that may be the price you pay for the ability to choose from more than 1,000 daily direct flights to 151 U.S. cities and approximately 119 daily direct flights to 52 international destinations.\nAviation experts say a big part of why air travel is so unpredictable is that the FAA's overhaul of the nation's air traffic system — from using ground-based radar to satellite navigation — has progressed much slower than was promised.\nCalled NextGen, the new system will cost the government and the airlines as much as $42 billion by 2025, according to FAA projections. O'Hare, because of its size and complex airspace management issues as well as lake-effect storms, has not been at the top of the FAA's list for introducing NextGen capabilities. Speeding up the delivery of NextGen programs would provide efficiencies benefiting O'Hare that cannot be generated by new runways alone. The new technologies would allow the FAA to safely operate more highways in the sky leading in and out of airports, as well as tighten the spacing between planes to optimize runway usage, officials said.\nStill, FAA officials said the next two new runways at O'Hare will also help limit air traffic control-related delays. Before O'Hare expansion started, the maximum number of arrivals that could be accommodated at the airport in an hour in poor weather or low visibility was usually limited to a range of 56 to 72 flights, even though the airlines had scheduled 90 to 100 arrivals each hour, the FAA said.\nWith the new runways, the arrival rate under the same conditions has increased to between 84 and 106 flights per hour, depending on wind direction, the FAA said.\n\"Now when the weather deteriorates, it has minimal impact on the arrival rate,'' said Paul Litke, the FAA's air traffic manager for the Lake Effect District.\nSome veteran O'Hare tower controllers challenged that assertion, saying that the six east-west parallel runways planned for O'Hare fix only one weather-delay scenario — cloud ceilings less than 1,000 feet and visibility below 3 miles. The new runway configuration does not represent a game changer in thunderstorms, snowstorms or high winds, the controllers said.\nLitke agreed, but added: \"In convective weather (thunderstorms), all bets are off anyway. No pilot is going to fly a metal tube through a lightning storm.''\nReduce taxi times\nApart from congestion that delays planes on the ground, the amount of time that aircraft taxi to and from runways — wheels moving typically the whole time — has increased at O'Hare due to the distance between the airline terminals and new airstrips.\nThe taxi-in time from the runway to the gate averaged 13 minutes per airplane in the first half of this year, up from about 81/2 minutes in 2007, the last year before the first new runway opened, according to the FAA. Taxi-in times were also about 81/2 minutes per plane in 2004, when O'Hare came up only about 7,500 flights short of reaching 1 million annual operations for the first time.\nLonger taxi patterns and airfield congestion are a trade-off aimed at increasing the number of planes able to land each hour, even if those aircraft spend more time reaching the terminal. Operationally, it is less expensive to have aircraft sitting on the ground than circling in the air.\n\"We are forecasting that the average taxi-in time will be reduced'' to 11 minutes per plane at O'Hare in the wake of the latest new runway that opened on Thursday, FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said. If the city's full build-out of O'Hare is achieved, taxi times are projected to improve by a couple of more minutes overall because planes should be \"free-flowing,'' Molinaro said.\nOperations officials at United have been particularly vocal about the increasing taxi distances and times, even though they were at the table more than a decade ago when the specifics of the O'Hare Modernization Program were presented, according to air traffic officials who attended meetings early on as well as recently.\n\"We have a runway that is in Bensenville and another one that is way up north,'' said one official. \"No one thinks United should be surprised or complaining about a 25-minute taxi.''\nO'Hare officials are evaluating new taxi configurations to move planes to gates and out to runways more quickly, Evans told the Tribune.\nImprove American, United operations\nBoth United and American — the two largest U.S. airlines — operate hubs at O'Hare, which is unusual. To compete for travelers, they match each other almost wingtip-to-wingtip to many destinations — despite a nonbinding agreement with the FAA in 2004 that lifted flight limits in exchange for promises that the airlines would not pack more flights into O'Hare than the airport could reasonably handle.\nIn recent years, airlines themselves have been the cause of many on-time delays, whether due to maintenance problems, crew rescheduling issues or any number of inefficiencies that are within their control.\nChicago's three major airlines — including Southwest Airlines at Midway Airport — haven't done well with being punctual in recent years and all share the same airspace in a roughly 30-mile ring around Chicago's two airports.\nO'Hare's two largest airlines have recently undergone megamergers, United with Continental and American with US Airways. United's integration was fraught with problems that affected its operations and on-time rates, including a botched combination of its passenger reservation system, the computer backbone of an airline. That led to rampant delays and cancellations for months in 2012. American will undergo that perilous reservation system cutover on Saturday.\nUnited, headquartered in Chicago and the city's largest carrier, ranked worst among major airlines in July for on-time arrivals nationwide, beating only ultradiscount carriers Spirit and Frontier, which have also increased their presence in Chicago in recent years and hurt on-time averages for the airport.\nThe airlines say they are making efforts to improve reliability, but it remains to be seen whether they will succeed enough to boost O'Hare on-time rates to respectability.\nUnited's new chief Oscar Munoz has specifically promised to improve the airline's on-time rates.\n\"Getting you to your destination, on schedule, can make or break your ability to succeed in a work endeavor or to hug a family member at an important moment,\" Munoz wrote in an email to frequent fliers last month. \"If our performance has not met your expectations, I want you to know I'm committed to learning how to better meet your needs and desires.\"\nWith such public backing from his new boss, Tracy Lee, United's vice president of network operations, has renewed clout at the airline to fix operations, even if it might cost the airline a little money. \"I think he (Munoz) recognizes that there's no bigger way to impact customer satisfaction than by having more on-time flights,\" Lee said.\nLee listed a number of initiatives United is implementing to help on-time rates, including high-tech measures, such as new software, and basic fundamentals, such as making sure United airport personnel know where they're supposed to be at all times to speed the turnaround of planes.\nAs part of its efforts to be more reliable, United said that starting in November it changed its schedule to double the number of \"out-and-back\" routes, flying from a hub, like O'Hare, to a destination and back again. That's as opposed to a flight leaving a hub and hopping to many cities across the country.\nThe strategy is aimed at isolating weather problems to a certain geographic areas. \"It doesn't allow weather in Chicago to infect the rest of the network,\" he said, adding that's also true for disruptions elsewhere not to affect Chicago flights.\nO'Hare underwent a major change in March when United and American both decided in the same month to \"rebank\" their schedules, meaning they would cluster more flights together, creating alternating periods of bustle and calm.\nBanked schedules create shorter connection times at airline hubs, making a connecting flight more appealing to customers. The risk is potentially worsening the airport's poor on-time record as congestion on O'Hare's taxiways and runways intensified. However, officials from both airlines insist that rebanking hasn't hurt, and might even help, on-time rates.\nOriginally, United officials figured all the factors that went into rebanking at O'Hare would be a wash, and on-time rates would stay about the same. \"But we believe it was actually a benefit to reliability at O'Hare,\" Lee said. \"O'Hare seemed to work better after we did the rebanking.\"\nAmerican said its on-time rates have improved since rebanking. Its O'Hare hub won the airline's internal \"Customer Cup\" award for customer satisfaction in the second quarter of the year, signaling it was the best-performing hub at American for those three months. And nationwide, American's on-time rates have returned to decent recently, ranking in the top half of 13 U.S. airlines for the months of July and August, for example.\nWhile it may be too soon to fairly judge the net effect of airlines' efforts to improve reliability, it hasn't helped noticeably so far, given O'Hare's mostly lousy arrival and departure rates. August offered a ray of hope, though. O'Hare's on-time arrival rate of 79 percent nearly met the national average rate of 80.2 percent among large airports. For departures, O'Hare's on-time rate was below average, according to the latest DOT data, but it wasn't among the very worst airports in the country, as it often has been.\nIn concert with the effort to group flights, American and United also are using larger aircraft, which means more people can fly out of O'Hare on fewer planes.\nLee at United said more recent data show the airline's on-time metrics seem to be trending in the right direction, with September's on-time rate 8 percentage points better than the September before. It had a day this month without any cancellations in its mainline fleet nationwide. \"That's a success,\" he said. \"I'd like to get to a point where that isn't news. But we're seeing some very positive trends.\"\nStill, the latest figures from the DOT show United near the bottom of the heap for on-time rates, ranking 10th of 13 airlines. \"Where we are performing right now is not where we want to perform,\" Lee said. \"We've still got a ways to go.\"\nTribune reporter Alex Bordens contributed.\njhilkevitch@tribpub.com\ngkarp@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jhilkevitch\nTwitter @spendingsmart\n O'Hare International Airport Federal Aviation Administration Travel Mike Quigley Richard M.
