In Stereo performs during rock week on The X Factor. Channel 7 X Factor's Guy Sebastian says he hates \"themed\" shows Local Real Estate \nHOPES of an Aussie boy band following in the footsteps of One Direction have been dashed with the elimination of In Stereo from The X Factor tonight. \nThe teen three-piece were eliminated from the reality singing show's rock week after their mentor Guy Sebastian came under fire for assigning the group Demons by Imagine Dragons. \nDespite having plenty of screaming fans in the studio audience each week, it appears the trio didn't have a strong backing from the voting public. \nIn Stereo competed against fellow group Jess & Matt in the show's bottom two, leaving Sebastian with just one act in the running for the show's grand prize. \n\"It's always hard with groups. I don't think I've ever had two in the bottom two ever and now it's happened two weeks in a row,\" Sebastian said. \nOn Twitter it seemed just as many viewers were mourning the boy band's elimination as those who were celebrating it.

You'll be big someday @EthanKarpathy @delgado_jakob @chrislanzon \n\nTwo of the group's three members, Ethan Karpathy and Chris Lanzon, previously competed on The Voices Kids. \nThey can take comfort in the parting words they received from the judges, with James Blunt saying the boy band's showdown performance was their best yet. \nIn Stereo also walks away from the show with a strong social media following including more than 50,000 Instagram followers. \n\"This isn't the end of us\" Karpathy said. \n\"We're going to keep working really hard.\" channel 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:37:01.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
