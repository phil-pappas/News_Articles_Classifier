The \"Don't Be Tardy\" star reveals she had the intention of returning for the next cycle, but it's just not possible. \"I asked about that,\" she tells E! News . \"I think was more heartbroken when I asked that question on Sunday, the day before the actual performance, well I can just come back another season, they said you can't because you've already learned the dances.\" The Bravo reality TV star and her partner Tony Dovolani previously begged the show's producers to let them stay on the show, but they wouldn't bend the rules. While she accepted the decision, she couldn't hide her disappointment as saying, \"I feel like you should have made some kind of adjustment because you've done it for other people in the past,\" citing season 15 champion Melissa Rycroft as an example. \"They made the exception for her.\" Kim was forced to withdraw from the competition as she wasn't cleared by her doctors to fly and couldn't perform in the September 28 episode. \"I'm not going to risk my life for anything, but it still doesn't make it any easier because I really loved the show,\" Kim admits. \"I love everybody on the show. I love everything about it. I didn't think I was going to love it. I think that's maybe why it's been so hard for me. They've asked me a number of times to do the show, and I always declined, and then I just really fell in love with it,\" she goes on sharing about her experience on the show. While she's already out of the competition, the 37-year-old is set to return for the finale, though she claims she has no idea what she will be doing. \"Nobody's told me what I'm doing,\" she says, \"I gave them kind of a suggestion. I just love everybody on the show, I love the whole network, so hopefully they'll go with what I suggest!\" \"DWTS\" returns Monday, October 12 at 8 P.M. on ABC with the remaining nine pairs, including frontrunners Bindi Irwin & Derek Hough and Nick Carter & Sharna Burgess. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Dancing with the Stars News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:33:55.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
