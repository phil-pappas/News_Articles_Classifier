He loved children and he wanted to see each and every child happy,\" said Ndoyiya who was there as part of a schools outreach programme by breakfast cereal company Kellogg's.\n\"[He used to say] if you can't give them food, give them a smile at least, give them love, give them happiness. Just show them that tomorrow will be better, don't show them the sorrows of today.\n\"To come here and spend this day [with the children] has taught me that kids need other people [in their lives], more especially because they come from family that are living in poverty where they hear everyday that 'I can't afford this, and I can't afford that',\" said Ndoyiya.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:04:46.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
