Clark has embraced the pressure of being considered the future of blues. So far, he’s kept the genre alive performing on the grandest stages alongside music's biggest acts, including Mick Jagger and Beyonce. This year, Clark opened for The Rolling Stones' kick-off tour. He joined the Foo Fighters’ tour for nearly two months and was a headliner at several popular music festivals, including Lollapalooza and the Austin City Limits Festival.
