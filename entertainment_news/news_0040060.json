Photo: Sunday Night \nA television interview with the founders of Reclaim Australia, once a group on society's fringe, was followed by a fiery response on social media on Sunday. \nThe group's founders, who call themselves \"patriotic Australians\" who want to stop \"Islamisation\" were beamed to loungerooms across the county on Channel Seven's  Sunday Night  in their first ever television interview.\nThe social media response was swift and divided. While some criticised the group and Channel Seven for giving them publicity, others agreed with their goal of \"protecting the Australian way of life\".\nThe show was billed as an in-depth look into the beginnings of the group, whose founders think of themselves as ordinary Australians. \nAdvertisement John Oliver, a co-founder of the group, told the show: \"I can't let my kids grow up in a country where kids are getting murdered in the streets. It's just not Australian.\"\nWhile fellow co-founder Catherine Brennan said: \"I'm just an everyday mum living in the suburbs doing the best job that I can for my family.\"\nMs Brennan told interviewer Alex Cullen she had never been politically active, but that the 2014 siege at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney was a turning point for her.\nShe said she and her family had planned to go to the cafe on the morning of the siege before their plans changed.\nFollowing the segment, #ReclaimAustralia was trending on Twitter and thousands of comments were posted to Sunday Night's Facebook page - mostly in support of the group's views.\nOne user even thanked Channel Seven, claiming they had gained an extra 5000 fans as a result.\n   \nBut others hit out at the station for broadcasting the show, claiming it was irresponsible to promote such a divisive group.\n#SundayNight why are you giving a voice to a bigoted cause by putting them in prime time television? Disgusting. #reclaimAustralia \n— Filip (@mcfilip) October 18, 2015  \nSome pointed out the irony of airing the group's views.\nWhat #sn7 is describing in tonights #ReclaimAustralia story, is what they would call \"radicalisation\" if these people were Muslim.\n— M.Požega (@matristik) October 18, 2015  \nOthers noted that Indigenous Australians are the only ones to have claims to reclaim the country.\n#ReclaimAustralia only makes any sense if your ancestory is First Nations, otherwise it's just a bunch of racist white folk. #auspol \n— Jansant (@Jansant) October 18, 2015 #reclaimAustralia forget history. Australia was founded on rape, robbery, and genocide by white religious supremacists.\n— Jo Evans (@4jevans) October 18, 2015  \nA poll encouraged viewers to vote whether or not the group represented Australian values.\nAt one stage 77 per cent responded 'yes', although at the time of writing it was 65 per cent, with many votes coming from Reclaim's Facebook fans who were urged to cast their vote.\nOne thing was clear: it had struck a nerve with many watching.\nGive me a mosque full of Muslims over 10 of #reclaimAustralia bogans #SundayNight \n— Todd Morgan (@todd_morgan) October 18, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:08:18.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
