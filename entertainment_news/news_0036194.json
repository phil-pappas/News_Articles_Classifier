Beyond the partisan squabbling, the hearings will seek answers to key policy questions concerning why the U.S. was in Benghazi in the first place and whether the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at the compound could have been prevented.\nYet even after eight investigations, 32 hearings and 70,000 pages of documents produced for various committees, these questions may never be fully answered.\nWith Republicans and Democrats so polarized and a new presidential election so close, committee members “are not even close to being on the same page,” said Joseph Wippl, a 30-year operations officer and manager at the CIA who now teaches at Boston University. “They’ll circle the wagons and protect their sides (and) the president, but I don’t think they’ll reach any results.”\nUSA TODAY\nHillary Clinton faces House Benghazi panel\nHere are the key questions sought by the committee and the answers to date:\nWhy did the U.S. have a compound in Benghazi despite the security risks?\nIn the months preceding the attack, Benghazi had been the site of a string of terrorist attacks against other Western diplomatic missions as militias linked to al-Qaeda became more violent. The State Department ordered Ambassador Stevens to prepare for a permanent post in Benghazi. Clinton hoped to announce the new office during a visit to the Libyan capital, Tripoli, later that year, according to testimony by Stevens’ deputy, Gregory Hicks.\nRepublicans on the House Armed Services Committee said in their report on the attacks that White House officials \"failed to comprehend or ignored\" deteriorating security conditions in Libya. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the administration's \"preference for a 'soft footprint' was part of the reason for what took place\" in Benghazi.\nThe special mission in Benghazi bolstered U.S. support for Libya’s democratic transition by engaging with leaders in eastern Libya, the birthplace of the revolt that overthrew former leader Moammar Gadhafi, according to the State Department's Accountability Review Board. Stevens knew and accepted the risks because he believed in his mission, Clinton testified.\nONPOLITICS\nClinton's Benghazi testimony: How to watch\nWhy did the State Department deny requests for more security at the compound?\nStevens had warned of a worsening security situation and had asked repeatedly for more security, up until the day he was killed. His requests were denied. A 16-member U.S. special forces contingent in Tripoli was reduced four, and its mission changed from embassy security to training Libyan forces. The Accountability Review Board blamed denials of Stevens' requests on four high-ranking State Department officials, citing \"systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies.\" Clinton said requests for more security never reached her desk. The department also had limited funds for security, which Clinton blamed on congressional budget cuts.\nWhat actions did the U.S. government take during the attacks to protect U.S. personnel?\nCIA security personnel stationed at a separate facility in Benghazi raced to the diplomatic outpost within 20 minutes of the attack. They exchanged fire with attackers, rescued State Department personnel and fought their way back to the CIA outpost. There, they continued to fight during sporadic fire and two separate attacks. A joint team of CIA and military officers flew from the Libyan capital, Tripoli, to Benghazi to help evacuate U.S. personnel. They arrived at the CIA annex shortly before a mortar attack there that killed CIA security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.\nThe U.S. military also directed a drone to fly from Derna to Benghazi, where it stayed during much of the night. Other Air Force assets and ground troops stationed in Europe were not in position to respond in time, according to then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.\nThe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which looked at the intelligence community’s role in the incident, found no evidence of a “stand down order” regarding the rescue of diplomats under fire, or that available air cover was denied. The November 2014 report countered claims made by Republican lawmakers in other investigative committees. It cleared the CIA of any wrongdoing, but said “mistakes were made” in the writing of talking points explaining the attack days after it happened.\nWhat was the administration’s explanation for the attack and how did it change?\nTalking points prepared by the CIA, State Department and the White House explaining the attack, blamed it in part on “extremists” and said it was “spontaneously inspired” by protests in Cairo and elsewhere. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time and now Obama’s national security adviser, used the talking points in Sunday talk show appearances to explain what happened to the public.\nEmails obtained by previous investigations showed that the CIA initially blamed the attacks on known terrorists linked to al-Qaeda. References to terrorism were later removed after the White House assigned Clinton aide Jake Sullivan to work with then-CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell to finalize the initial talking points on Benghazi.\nAn email sent by Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, to White House officials said Rice's talk show appearances should \"underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy\" and \"reinforce the president and administration's strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges.\"\nUSA TODAY\nSenator: E-mails show how Benghazi story shaped\nRepublicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said those talking points downplayed the role of terrorism to protect Obama's anti-terrorism credentials weeks before a close presidential election.\nThe White House said it relied on the best intelligence available at the time, and when better intelligence arrived, the story was clarified.\nRep.
