Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\" \nCraig admitted the only reason he would ever suit up as 007 again would \"be for the money,\" and that he wasn't even particularly interested in filming Spectre. \"Well, I was contracted to do another one,\" he explained. \nListen to Sam Smith's James Bond theme \nAs for his Bond successor, \"I don't give a f---\" who it will be, Craig said, before eloquently elaborating, \"Don't be sh--. You've got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now. So don't be sh--.\" \nYou hear that, Idris Elba ? Don't be sh--, and you'll be OK. \nSpectre will be released Nov. 6. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com View the original article on TVGuide.com *DISCLAIMER* : The information contained in or provided through this site section is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional advice.
