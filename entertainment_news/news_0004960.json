The collection, which hits stores November 1, 2015, includes four styles inspired by Kacey’s life and music. Golden Arrow, the collection’s headliner, offers vintage western style with a pointed kick. Constructed in marbled white leather, Golden Arrow boasts metallic accents and Kacey’s signature golden arrow on the side seam.\n“This boot is majorly influenced from a 1950s pair that are my absolute favorite...I probably wear them at every show,” said Kacey. “Also the symbol that has brought me so many reasons to celebrate - the arrow.”\nThree new designs round out the collection: Gallop, available in both Dusty Pink and Bridle Brown, offers a tall ride with sassy fringe and Monterrey, a vibrant Western bootie, features a Southwestern-blanket design that encircles the ankle.\nFor the initial launch, Kacey for Lucchese will be available exclusively at country lifestyle retailer CountryOutfitter.com and select locations of the 50-year-old Western retail chain Cavender’s before expanding to other retailers in the spring.\n“We want our customers to enjoy the full Lucchese experience from discovery in-store and online to wearing our boots with pride,” said Cindy Moore, Lucchese’s V.P. of Sales. “To offer more avenues for consumers to find Kacey for Lucchese, we selected Cavender’s and Country Outfitter as partners because they share our enthusiasm for Kacey and her collection.”\nKacey will help Lucchese celebrate the official launch on November 2 at the Nashville Lucchese store two days before she attends the Country Music Award (CMA) ceremony where she’s nominated for three awards, including Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year for Pageant Material.\nIn addition to CountryOutfitter.com and select Cavender’s locations, the collection can be found at Lucchese retail stores (Houston, Nashville, San Antonio and Santa Fe) and Lucchese.com.\nAbout Kacey Musgraves:\nTexas-native and Nashville-based singer/songwriter, Kacey Musgraves released her Mercury Records Nashville debut album, Same Trailer Different Park, in the spring of 2013 to massive critical acclaim and recognition.
