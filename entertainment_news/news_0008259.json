Pictures Levi Miller (left, background) is Peter, Hugh Jackman is Blackbeard and Rooney Mara is Tiger Lily in “Pan.” Sony Pictures Classics Gong Li plays a different kind of casualty of China’s Cultural Revolution in Zhang Yimou’s “Coming Home.” \nHere's a look at some of the new movies opening in theaters in Milwaukee Friday. '99 Homes' \nHow far does the bottom drop out before it takes you with it? \nAs a man who just lost his home in the housing bubble of 2008, Andrew Garfield in \"99 Homes\" finds out, when he gets a second chance to put a roof over his family's head by going to work for the ruthless wheeler-dealer (Michael Shannon) who got them thrown out of their house in the first place. \nWritten and directed by Ramin Bahrani, \"99 Homes\" is getting raves, for its everyday realism and for Garfield and Shannon's gritty performances. Joe Neumaier at the New York Daily News gave it 4 stars (out of 5), saying \"this kind of front-line filmmaking was a staple of 1970s cinema, and Bahrani's film...is in that proud tradition.\" \n\"99 Homes\" is rated R for language and a brief violent image. It runs for 110 minutes. 'Pan' \nDoes Peter Pan really need an origin story? Well, he's getting one in \"Pan.\" \nAs imagined by director Joe Wright, Peter (Levi Miller) is an orphan whisked off to Neverland by Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman), where he's to be enslaved but could also be the one to topple the dreaded pirate, with the help of a pre-captain's-bars Hook (Garrett Hedlund) and a princess named Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). \nSo far, critics are not liking the swashbuckling or, really, much of anything about it. The Wrap's Alfonso Duralde's take is pretty harsh, but in sync with a number of reviewers: \"'Pan' is, for the most part, ugly to look at, shrill to listen to, and performed by actors who have been encouraged to camp it up madly.\" \n\"Pan\" is rated PG for fantasy action violence, language and some thematic material. It runs for 111 minutes. 'He Named Me Malala' \nIf there's anyone who can give you hope in the future, it's Malala Yousafzai. When she was 15, Taliban gunmen, after opening fire on her school bus in Pakistan, shot her in the head because she had been speaking out on behalf of girls' education. \nInstead of being silenced, she became a world figure, receiving the Nobel Peace Prize last year and continuing her campaign for the rights of children everywhere to education and a life in peace. \n\"He Named Me Malala,\" a documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Davis Guggenheim (\"An Inconvenient Truth\"), was featured at this year's Milwaukee Film Festival and opens nationwide this week. \nMany of the reviews have a \"loved her, tolerated the movie\" vibe. Christy Lemire, who reviews for rogerebert.com , gave it 2 stars, calling it a disappointment: \"While we do indeed see the normalcy of her home life with her parents and younger brothers and the regular, teenage-girl instincts that exist alongside her courage, we never get a glimpse into her deeper feelings.\" \n\"He Named Me Malala\" is rated PG-13 for thematic elements. It runs for 87 minutes. 'Peace Officer' \nThe centerpiece film and one of the most powerful works showing at this year's Milwaukee Film Festival, the documentary \"Peace Officer\" gets a welcome one-week run starting Friday at the Times Cinema, 5906 W. Vliet St. \nThirty years after he founded the first SWAT team in Utah, former sheriff William \"Dub\" Lawrence saw his own son-in-law killed by members of that same unit. \"Peace Officer\" follows Lawrence's dogged pursuit of the truth — following evidence, not passion — as part of a broader discussion of the increased militarization of law enforcement. \nAnd so far, \"Peace Officer\" has found believers: As of midweek, it had a 100% \"fresh\" rating on RottenTomatoes.com . The Washington Post's Michael O'Sullivan, who gave it 3 stars, is representative: \"The documentary's greatest strength lies in Lawrence. A retired police officer with a history of support for SWAT actions in principle and in practice ... Lawrence never gets worked up as he presents his forensics, despite his obvious personal stake in the problems he's describing.\" \n\"Peace Officer\" is not rated, but has language, mature themes and images of the aftermath of violence. It runs for 109 minutes. 'Big Stone Gap' \nIt's not that bad a life, being single and 40 and living in a small town in the mountains. \nOr so says Ave Maria (Ashley Judd), who works at the family pharmacy and is seemingly OK with things being as they've always been. That is, until a family secret leaks out, even as she meets a good, and good-looking, man (Patrick Wilson) who's ready to settle down. \n\"Big Stone Gap,\" the romantic comedy based on writer-director Adriana Trigiani's bestselling novel of the same name, has an impressive cast, including Whoopi Goldberg, John Benjamin Hickey, Jane Krakowski and Jenna Elfman. \n\"Big Stone Gap\" is rated PG-13 for brief suggestive material. It runs for 103 minutes. 'Coming Home' \nFew filmmakers blend the epic and the personal better than Zhang Yimou. The latest from the director of \"Raise the Red Lantern,\" \"Coming Home,\" is a prime example. \nA couple (Chen Daoming, Gong Li) are separated when he is imprisoned during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. When he's released three years later, he finds she had an accident and has no memory of what he looks like, so he has to find a way to help her find him again. \nEntertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty gave \"Coming Home\" an A-minus, as an \"emotionally devastating love story ... the kind of lump-in-your-throat drama they don't make much anymore.\" \n\"Coming Home\" is rated PG-13 for some thematic material. It's in Mandarin with English subtitles, and runs for 109 minutes. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
