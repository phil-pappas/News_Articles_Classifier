She has published six best-selling rural romances and her new \"life lit\" novel, The Patterson Girls (Harlequin), is about sisters, love, infertility, infidelity and grief.\nThe Baby Sitters Club series\nAnn M. Martin \nThese were the first books I obsessed over. They got me addicted to reading and opened me up to a whole new world of literary adventures. Those babysitters were so cool, and my friends and I wanted to start our own club.\nGreat Expectations \nCharles Dickens \nAdvertisement One of the few books I read and enjoyed during high-school English. I particularly fell in love with Miss Havisham, who was jilted at the altar and lived the rest of the life in her wedding dress. There was something tragically romantic about her character and I still love her; in fact, she inspired a scene in my first novel. \nBridget Jones' Diary \nHelen Fielding \nI devoured this book in one sitting in my early 20s and had an epiphany about my own writing. Until then I'd been writing for my university lecturers, but Bridget made me realise I wanted to write an entertaining book that could make people laugh and cry, while exploring universal emotions. I started being true to myself when I wrote. \nThe Harry Potter series\nJ.K.Rowling \nThese are the books I've reread more than any other. I first read them on my own, then shared them with my husband and now we read them to our children. The clever, magic storytelling never ends and I still dream of getting a Hogwarts letter. Reading HP reminds me to let my imagination run wild.\nOn Writing \nStephen King \nI have a hundred writing-craft books but this is the only one I come back to: it is an inspiring insight into a master's mind and King's advice is so simple yet so thorough. My copy is so tattered that I recently bought another one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:00:56.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
