Dobby, a house-elf from Harry Potter, was a badly mistreated servant, slave almost, of the Malfoys - one of the film's main baddies, if you like. House-elves aren't allowed leave their house unless they're presented with clothes by their master, which would make them free.\nIn the book and film, Harry Potter tricks one of the Malfoys into giving Dobby a black sock that belonged to Tom Riddle, which freed Dobby from his servitude. It sounds daft to people outside the bubble, sure, but it's a powerful moment.\nSo yeah, socks and Dobby sorta go together. Anyway, the reason why we're bringing this up is fans have been leaving socks next to the statuette of Dobby on the WB Studio Tour in an attempt to free Dobby from the glass case he's in.\nTake a look.\nPeople have been trying to free Dobby at the WB Studio Tour ðŸ˜¢ pic.twitter.com/qTduzDmZvu\n— Hogwarts Logic (@HogwartsLogic) September 27, 2015\nShut up, you're crying.\nVia Twitter\nMORE: Watch: Bald James McAvoy and Bearded Daniel Radcliffe introduce the trailer for Victor Frankenstein\nMORE: Eight behind-the-scenes extras from your favourite movies\nMORE: Eddie Redmayne confirmed for Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts (And Where To Find Them)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/HogwartsLogic/status/648202470842195968/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/HogwartsLogic/status/648202470842195968", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JUXPaarIbM", "http://t.co/qTduzDmZvu"], "published": "2015-10-04T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:55:37.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
