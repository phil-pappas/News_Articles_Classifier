Only about 15 percent of those artists received the go-ahead nod from jurors Tyler Cann, Petra Kralickova and Marilyn Simmons.\nOut of 59 whose works were accepted, five live in the Dayton or nearby towns: Doug McLarty, Xenia; Tom Croce, Lebanon; Bill Franz, Dayton; Ronald Geibert, Beavercreek; and Dennie Eagleson, Springfield.\nWorks were submitted in drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, ceramics, mixed media and video. But the local five people favor some sort of photography.\nEven though a $1,000 Best of Show and three $500 Juror’s Choice Awards have not yet been announced, gallery administrators chose to present an image of Doug McLarty’s work on the Ohio Arts Council website.\nHere’s a look at the exhibit’s works by the local artists:\nDoug McLarty\n“Vortex d’Hibiscus,” scanography\nHis work in the show is a vibrant swirl of wilting floral blossoms in the warm colors of red, purple, orange and yellow. He arranges natural items on a high-resolution flatbed scanner in elaborate designs.\n“I was thrilled to be included in the Inaugural Juried Exhibition at Riffe. It is a distinct honor, especially considering the number of talented, dynamic, and deserving artists in Ohio,” said McLarty.\nTom Croce\n“Morning Along the Ohio,” digital SLR photography\n“During the early spring with its warm days and cool nights on a still morning, there can be a layer of fog along the Ohio River Valley. I arrived at the location just after sunrise to a very dense fog layer,” said Croce. “As the sun began to peek above the horizon and the fog began to lift, the curve of the river valley and the layers of the hill and the city began to reveal themselves.”\nCroce just released his first book of black-and-white images, “Ohio Landscape,” and is currently working on a series of abstract floral images.\nBill Franz\n“Linemen,” photography\nFranz is a retired engineer/business consultant, and this image took him into a new photographic direction, taking photos of people working.\n“Before taking the photo I had never noticed the series of poles set closely together about 100 years from Dryden Road in Dayton. But the men climbing the poles caught my eye as I drove past,” said Franz. “Luckily I had my camera … I needed to drive into a mobile home park, walk across a field and then hold the camera above my head to take photos over the top of a fence.”\nHe has a solo show at the Yellow Springs Brewery, “Women Working,” from Oct. 28 through Nov. 22.\nDennie Eagleson\n“Violets 2,” photogram\nShe created the work by improvising with Fuji instant print film. A collection of plant materials placed on print material and exposed to an intense burst of light.\n“You’re in total darkness, you have to feel around to work,” said Eagleson. “You don’t know what you get until the processing pod is done after a minute or so.”\nShe then scans that 3-inch-by-4-inch image, and makes a 16-inch-by-20-inch archival digital print.\nThe retired Antioch photography professor became a farmer with six acres in Clark County five years ago. She will show “lumen prints” as part of a group show at Dayton Visual Arts Center next September.\nRonald Geibert\n“Albers,” inkjet print\nPhotographs/scans pages of text, then reconfigured them into a collage.\n“We learn things in bits and pieces. I’ve been doing a whole series of using various images and putting them together in a way that makes sense,” said Geibert, a Wright State photography professor retired in 2008.\nContact contributing writer Pamela Dillon at pamdillon@woh.rr.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:05:33.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
