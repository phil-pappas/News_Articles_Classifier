Bartender Kyle Smith serves Pine Street Belgian Blonde beer to Morning Call reporter Ryan Kneller at the Two Rivers Brewing Co., the city’s newest brewery. (Harry Fisher / The Morning Call) TWO RIVERS BREWING CO.\n542 Northampton St.\n610-829-1131, tworiversbrewing.com\nIt's around 5 p.m. on a Thursday and I have not eaten since 10:30 a.m. I decide to make my way to Two Rivers Brewing Co. for two reasons: 1. The restaurant has half-price appetizers until 7 p.m. and, 2. I thought it appropriate to start my bar hopping excursion at the city's newest brewery.\nYes, made-on-premises beer is flowing — four years after the owners purchased the former Mount Vernon Ale House, built circa 1810, and nearly three years after they opened the 122-seat restaurant.\nKneller visits a number of downtown Easton watering holes.\n(Harry Fisher) With co-owner Troy Reynard as my guide, I take a tour of the $250,000 brew house on the second and third floors. The facility was no easy task to complete because many of the wooden supports had to be replaced with steel beams to bear the weight of seven fermentation tanks and 10 serving tanks — each holding 220 gallons of beer.\n\"This was our only option as we were limited by space,\" Reynard explained.\nDownstairs, I meet my sister, Megan Daly, for drinks and grub (open-faced grilled cheese and a short rib quesadilla) at the 15-seat wooden bar. Dating to 1929, it is complemented by other historical features such as restored terrazzo flooring and tin ceilings.\nWe each order one of 11 Two Rivers beers on tap.\nBartender Kyle Smith serves me a pint of the Pine St. Blonde ($4), a Belgian blonde ale brewed with European wheat malt and lightly spiced with hints of coriander and orange peel. It's the most popular, Reynard said, and I find it sweet, refreshing and slightly reminiscent of Blue Moon.\nMy sister opts for a darker variety — the Bankers Brown Ale ($4), featuring a \"light chocolate and coffee flavor with a good caramel background.\"\n\"It's really smooth and drinkable,\" she said.\nOther in-house selections include a Batch 1 Session IPA, brewed with cascade, citra and nugget hops; Getter Island Pale Ale, featuring a mild toastiness balanced with a moderate bitterness; and Danny Mann Irish Stout, distinguished by flavors of black coffee. Flights costing $10, featuring five 4-ounce pours of each, are available.\nFor those not interested in draft brews, which include guest beers from regional producers such as Fegley's and Saucony Creek, Two Rivers also offers nearly two dozen varieties of wine and whiskey, as well as 10 signature cocktails, including the popular gin-based Cin Cin and Strawberry-Thyme Press.\nHappy hour, featuring $4 drafts, is offered 4-7 p.m. weekdays. Make sure to stop by on Wednesday when a tin of bacon is served with every bar order.\nPORTERS' PUB\n700 Northampton St.\n610-250-6561, porterspubeaston.com\nFrom Two Rivers, my sister and I walk a couple of blocks west to Porters' Pub, where we meet some of my friends and fellow Morning Call reporters — Stephen Gross, Jackie Palochko, Bill Landauer and Emily Opilo.\nThe 60-seat restaurant, celebrating its 25th anniversary, lives up to its label of \"quintessential Old World pub\" with a European feel by serving international cuisine such as Scottish salmon and Tuscany chicken, as well as more than 150 craft brews and a variety of single malt scotches, bourbons and whiskeys.\nOwned by brothers Larry, Ken and Jeff Porter, it is a popular place for beer buffs, as evidenced by the 4,200 pewter mugs hanging from the ceiling.\nThe shiny cups, denoting members of Porters' Mug Club, are earned by finishing 60 designated brews. Appreciation for the devoted drinkers is shown on Tuesdays, when the bar offers discounts on all 12 draft beers.\nNone of us is part of the prestigious posse, but we enjoy our drinks just the same at a table near the 11-seat bar, which is mostly filled.\nFor Megan, Jackie and Bill, standard selections of Guinness, Yuengling and Johnnie Walker Red Label and club soda are savored, respectively.\nThe rest of us are feeling adventurous and down beers we haven't tried: Leffe Blonde, a golden ale from Belgium, for Stephen; Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout, a rich and creamy stout from California, for Emily; and Franziskaner Heffe-Weissbier, a citrus-infused wheat bear from Germany (recommended by our server, Abby Heissler), for me.\nAccording to bartender Stephen Chicca, the pub is known for its Porters' House ESB, a session crafted for the pub by Stoudts Brewing Co. in Adamstown, Lancaster County, as well as its smoked Bloody Marys.\nThe Ernie Stadler Jazz Quartet is playing. Chicca notes other entertainment includes an open mic on the first and third Wednesdays of the month; a Celtic jam on the second and fourth Wednesdays of the month; and live music every Friday and Saturday.\nMESA MODERN MEXICAN\n42 S. Third St.\n610-829-2101, mesamexican.com\nThe night's halfway point takes us to Mesa Modern Mexican, known for its tacos, tequilas and other south-of-the-border specialties.\nMy sister has bid farewell, but my Morning Call crew follows me to the margarita mecca, which opened almost three years ago in the former Mex Tex Trio space.\nCo-owned by Juan Carlos Paredes and Rafael Palomino, the duo behind Tapas on Main in Bethlehem, the 150-seat restaurant is a sleek and inviting spot, with bronze-colored walls, flickering candles and Latin American sculptures.\nSitting at the large U-shaped bar, the ladies order Coronas (no draft beer is available) while the gentlemen peruse the margarita menu. Among the dozen varieties (available on the rocks or frozen) are unique concoctions such as blueberry lemon, pomegranate mint and sparkling watermelon.\nWe take bartender Dillon Miller's suggestion of ordering two 8-ounce glasses, instead of one 16-ounce Mason jar, so we can sample more. The price is still the same at $8.\nFor our first picks, Bill goes with the most-popular choice, classic lime, while Stephen and I opt for strawberry jalapeno. Having tasted my fair share of jalapeno margaritas, I can say with full confidence that this is my favorite — the perfect blend of spicy and sweet.\nTo satisfy our hunger, I order a couple of shareable appetizers: palomino guacamole ($10.95), one of four varieties made in front of customers; and a carne asada quesadilla ($9.95). Both are devoured within minutes.\nThe second round of margaritas includes the following flavors: coconut (Bill); Fun & Flirty, featuring pomegranate, pineapple juice and mango liqueur (Stephen); and Mojito-rita, combining the ingredients of a mojito and margarita (me).\nI'm already looking forward to my return visit when I can try the gin-based cocktail See You on the Floor, which Miller says is his favorite and the most popular of the eight featured drinks.\nHappy hour specials, offered 5-7 p.m. weekdays and 3-5 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, include $5 margaritas and glasses of wine, as well as $1 off all bottled beers. Other promotions include $2 tacos on Tuesdays and salsa dancing on Saturday nights.\n3RD & FERRY FISH MARKET\n56 S. Third St.\n610-829-1404, thirdandferry.com\nFor stop four, The Morning Call gang travels a couple of doors down to Easton's newest seafood spot, 3rd & Ferry Fish Market.\nCo-owned by husband and wife Mike and Rebecca Pichetta, who operated the former Vintage Restaurant and Bar in Williams Township, the 165-seat restaurant is known for its fresh fish dishes, including grouper and tilapia, as well as its raw-bar selections, such as oysters and middleneck clams.\nWhile I've enjoyed scallops, mussels and other ocean fare at the 11/2-year-old restaurant, I've never sipped one of its handcrafted cocktails, nor have I sat at the 30-seat copper bar stretching the length of the restaurant. Now is the time.\nDesiring a gin drink, I order the refreshing William Henry Pratt ($8), made with Hendrick's gin, lime, St. Elder, confectionary sugar, egg white, lime zest and cracked black pepper.\nAccording to bartender Monica Round, it is one of the most popular specialty drinks, along with the Red Rover Bloody Mary (featuring Old Bay vodka) and Freddy's Haunting (Jim Beam bourbon, honey-thyme syrup, pineapple juice and orange bitters).\nJackie opts for a \"smooth and delicious\" Liquid Hero \"Schweet\" Strawberry Wheat Ale ($6), one of 16 draft beers that regularly rotates, while the others switch gears and order water for the drive home.\nOther rotating brews include those from national brands such as Dogfish Head and Founders, as well as regional favorites such as Free Will Mango Wheat and Weyerbacher Last Chance Apricot IPA. Flights are available for those who want a variety.\nThe restaurant, which displays and sells local artwork, claims to offer the \"happiest happy hour in Easton\" with $8 specialty cocktails and $5 craft beer drafts, glasses of wine and steamed clams, 5-6 p.m. and 10-11 p.m., Tuesday through Friday.\nPEARLY BAKER'S ALE HOUSE\n11 Centre Square\n610-253-9949, pearlybakers.net\nFive hours and four drinks later, I complete the final leg of my bar crawl at Pearly Baker's Ale House on Centre Square. The 20-year-old pub, boasting an impressive selection of beers and burgers, is one of my favorite downtown Easton destinations.\nCo-owned by Jonathan Davis and Greg Schuyler, the same guys behind Mueller's Kitchen in Williams Township, the 90-seat restaurant is housed inside a mid-19th century building that originally served as Easton's first YMCA.\nDefining characteristics include a crystal chandelier, potted plants suspended from a skylight and an abundance of beer taps hanging from the walls and ceiling.\nBill and Emily have bowed out, but Jackie and Stephen keep me company at the 20-seat marble bar, which is overrun with 20- and 30-somethings eager to butcher songs such as ACDC's \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" on a karaoke stage. Surprisingly, I still don't have enough liquid courage to join in.\nSince I started the crawl with a locally produced brew, I decide to end it the same way — this time, with a Weyerbacher Last Chance IPA ($6). I'm not typically a fan of IPAs, but this one's always been an exception.\nAccording to assistant manager Roger Csatari, the 25 taps are constantly changing, but in-demand beers usually are from regional breweries such as Troegs, Victory and Weyerbacher.\nA \"hoppy hour,\" featuring discounts on IPAs, will be introduced soon, he says.\nRounding out the bar selections are a lengthy list of wines and about a dozen signature cocktails, including the popular Terrapin Station (peach vodka, schnapps and other ingredients) and Pearly Baker's chocolate martini.\nOther reasons to visit: regular live music (check the website) and the Pearl Card loyalty program, offering gifts to customers acquiring enough points (each dollar spent equals one point).\nrkneller@mcall.com\n610-820-6597", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-558370c8/turbine/mc-pictures-reporter-ryan-kneller-pub-hopping-in-easton-20150618", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562afed2/turbine/mc-tworivers-jpg-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:34:20.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
