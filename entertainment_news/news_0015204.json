( Mark Leffingwell / Staff Photographer ) \nStarting today, fans of Boulder Organic's line of fresh, ready-to-eat soups will have one more store at which to snag some stew. \nSix different flavors of the organic soups will be on shelves at 850 Targets nationwide, in a roll-out that both helps and highlights the soup company's continued growth. \n\"Target is going to be a great customer for us,\" said Greg Powers, CEO of Boulder Organic. \"They have an ongoing and growing focus on natural and organic products, and we're happy to be a company they identified as central to that goal.\" \nPowers said the deal cements Target as one of Boulder Organic's biggest customers. The retail giant also will be the launching pad for two new flavors: chicken, quinoa and kale; and chicken vegetable chili with beans. \nThose profiles are the company's first with meat. They will be available at all locations that carry Boulder Organic product, including Whole Foods, King Soopers and Alfalfa's. \nAll of the soups — produced at the rate of 26,400 pounds per day at an 86,000-square-foot facility in Niwot — are organic and gluten-free, and the vegetarian options are non-GMO. \n\"Anything Boulder Organic does will be done with care (and) consideration for the environment, with healthy ingredients as a primary concern,\" said Bill Capsalis, president of industry trade group Naturally Boulder. \"This is a company with a very focused true north on the compass of doing things right.\" Advertisement \nThat commitment to fresh, ready-to-eat food has paid off for Boulder Organic as the segment has grown. \n\"(Millenials) tend to want convenience and are willing to pay more for healthier products that are from companies that align with their set of values,\" Capsalis said. \"With canned soup sales dying, fresh prepared soups will scoop up that whole market.\" \nSales have doubled every year since they were founded in 2006, Powers said, and they are one track to be up 150 percent in 2015. \n\"That (growth is) definitely going to continue in the foreseeable future,\" he said. \"Next year, they should easily double again.\" \nPowers said the credit for Boulder Organic's success belongs, in part, to the community of companies in Boulder dedicate to natural and organic foods. \n\"We're simply following in the footsteps of other companies that have gone before us,\" he said. \"It's easier when the path has been blazed for you.\" \nShay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com , @shayshinecastle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:30:48.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
