Rob Kardashian, who shared a close bond with his former brother-in-law, also came out of seclusion to support him. The family have now reportedly boarded a flight out of Las Vegas, however ex-wife Khloe has refused to leave Odom's side. Odom and Khloe married in 2009 after a whirlwind romance but in 2013, Khloe filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalised in July this year. \nAccording to People magazine, Khloe was given responsibility for making medical decisions about Odom's treatment, as it emerged that the couple are still legally married since their divorce has not been processed. \nPosting identical statements online last night, Khloe, Kim, Kendall, Kylie and Kourtney said they had suspended all activity on their paid-for apps while they focus on his recovery. \". \nExplaining their lack of activity to fans, they said: \"As a family we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar. Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time.\" \nLamar Odom's children, Lamar Jr and Destiny, have also spoken about their father just hours after visiting his bedside. In a statement given to E! News, they said: 'Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad. We are here with our family and friends. We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\" \nIt's thought that the basketball star's drug binge was triggered by an upsetting call on Sunday (11 October), in connection with his portrayal on Keeping up with the Kardashians, \nAccording to TMZ , the sports star became 'irate' after the conversation which was related to an episode of the E! reality show in which his ex-wife Khloe reveals her fears for Lamar following the recent drug-related death of his best friend. She expressed her concerns that Lamar would 'spiral' out of control after suffering another loss in his life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:06:29.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
