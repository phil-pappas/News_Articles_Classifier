Here in Massachusetts, there are other colors that send us on the road to take in our world: rich, deep maroon against icy blue.\nWe’re talking cranberries. Ripe, rich cranberries floating on a pond of clear blue. In the coming weeks, with cranberry harvest at its peak, there are bogs all over the state worth visiting.\nCranberries have been part of New England heritage since, well, forever. Before the settlers arrived, the natives used them for dyeing, cooking and more. Once the area was settled, cranberries were used for all that and to fight scurvy on ships crossing the sea. In 1683, someone figured out how to juice them. There are more than 14,000 acres of working bogs in the state, and cranberries are our No. 1 agricultural crop.\nSo how does one celebrate the cranberry? Of course, there are festivals; the king of them all, perhaps, is the annual Cranberry Harvest Celebration (admakepeace.com), Oct. 10-11 in Wareham, alongside working bogs. The celebration features wet harvest operations, cooking demonstrations by chefs, food, crafts and more.\nConsider these ideas for getting close with the harvest:\nTake in a hay ride: At Chamberlain Farm in Berkley, you’ll find hay rides, a corn maze, a pumpkin patch and even, on occasion, farm-to-table dinners served bogside. Chamberlain Farm (chamberlainfarm.com) is more than just a bog. A choice location for weddings, the farm’s goal is to grow and harvest beautiful berries, and to educate the world on local agriculture. The farm hosts birthday (and any occasion) parties as well.\nPlay golf among the berries: Which came first, the bogs or the fairways? In the case of Southers Marsh Golf Club (southersmarsh.com) in West Plymouth, locals know the answer: The bogs. Local Will Stearns has long farmed the bogs and carved out a few holes for friends to play on. Then, he and his family took the plunge and carved out a beautiful, challenging and fun 18-hole course winding through their bogs. Harvest time does not stop golf, and golf does not slow down the harvest.\nYou can play a fairway next to a bog in the process of harvest. It offers some of the most breathtaking scenery you can find on a course, and certainly some of the most unique.\nEach year, the club harvests the bog closest to the clubhouse in a special way — by pulling on the cranberry gathering bladder to create a deep maroon heart in the middle of the bog. Brides have been known to plan weddings around this special sight.\nSouthers Marsh is a public course and has deals on its website, as well as updated harvest information.\nBe the farmer: It’s one thing to watch a harvest. What if you could throw on some waders and get in there and help? That’s just what you can do at Mayflower Cranberries (mayflowercranberries.com) in Plympton. For a fee, you can wear the gear, learn the trade and help with the harvest for one long, beautiful day. The farm also teaches the history of the berry. For instance, you may learn that berries don’t have to be planted annually; the vines float up and then settle down when the bogs are drained and will grow more berries the next year. Some Massachusetts bog vines are as old as 150 years. Reservations are required, and the cost is $50. For $10 and no reservation, you take part in a bog tour that gives up-close looks and lots of history, too. Kids 5 and younger are free.\nGet a guided tour: Bettyann’s Step-On Tours (cranberrytours.com) leave from the Plymouth Information Center on the waterfront several times each day during harvest season. You drive to the most active working bogs on the given day to take photos and experience it all. Tour guides are well-versed in the area, the agriculture and the history.\nAnd of course you can just meander along in your car on a long drive. Cape Cod is rich with bogs, many in Harwich, East Taunton and Acushnet, among others. You can find maps and details at cranberries.org. Just think: You can fight scurvy while you enjoy a road trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:07:56.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
