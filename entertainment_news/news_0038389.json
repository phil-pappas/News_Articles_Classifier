With its stainless steel finish and gull wing doors, the DeLorean DMC-12 is among the most memorable cars in film history.\nNow, USA TODAY is giving you the chance to experience the Back to the Future time machine like never before – in fully spherical 360-degree video.\nSo, grab your Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, Cardboard or any other virtual reality headset and immerse yourself inside the DeLorean. Don’t have a headset, no problem! Just use your mouse, click and hold, to move around the scene on your computer screen.\nBack to the Future screenwriter Bob Gale shows you the inside of the time machine and takes you for a ride around Universal Studio’s Courthouse Square – the same location where many of Back to the Future’s scenes were shot.\nAs you watch the video, keep in mind these three facts about the Back to the Future DeLorean:\n1. A total of seven DeLoreans (including one fiberglass replica) were used in the filming of the Back to the Future trilogy.\n2. On cold nights during filming, crews had to heat the DeLorean's gull wing door struts with hair dryers to keep the doors from falling closed.\n3. The DeLorean's speedometer only actually goes up to 80 miles per hour. So the film crew added an extra speedometer on the dashboard to show the car's speed rising to 88 m.p.h., which is what is seen in the films. Why 88 m.p.h.? \"No particular reason,\" Gale said. \"It's really easy to remember.\"\nGREAT SCOTT! 30 YEARS LATER, WE'RE 'BACK TO THE FUTURE' 'Back to the Future' 30 years later: Michael J.
