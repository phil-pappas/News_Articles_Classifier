He had quit touring in September after developing \"a problem with severe back pain.\"\n\"Cory was like a brother in so many ways,\" said Hutton. \"We had been together since 1965 and I am in shock at this sudden loss.\"\nThree Dog Night was a staple on the oldies circuit, playing Las Vegas every year or two. They played The Cannery last June and in 2013, and the Fremont Street Experience in 2009.\nThe original group played the Las Vegas Convention Center in January 1970 in its breakout days of fame, on the heels of the singles \"One,\" \"Easy to be Hard' and \"Eli's Coming.\"\nSince the mid-1980s, the group was fronted by Wells and Hutton. The third original singer, Chuck Negron, tours separately as a solo act. Jimmy Greenspoon, the group's keyboardist from its original albums, died earlier this year of melanoma.\nThe group's hits include \"Celebrate,\" \"Joy to the World,\" \"Mama Told Me (Not to Come),\" \"Black & White\" and \"Shambala.\"\nWells was born Emil Lewandowski on February 2, 1941. His early success with a Los Angeles band called The Enemys led to a meeting with Hutton when both went tour with Sonny and Cher, and the idea to form a group with three lead singers.\nRead more from Mike Weatherford at reviewjournal.com.
