Pokie Nation Trailer 2:09 \nThey've been called \"electronic morphine\" and \"the crack cocaine of gambling\". Ever wonder what makes Pokies so addictive? ABC documentary Ka-Ching! Pokie Nation takes you inside the machine to find out. Courtesy ABC. October 15th 2015 /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/TV/ \nIN JUST over 50 years, they’ve gone from being illegal, to being everywhere. \nThat is the foreboding opening line delivered by the narrator of an explosive new ABC documentary that pulls back the veil on the industry designed to maximise the addictive nature of pokie machines. \nThey’ve been called the “crack cocaine of gambling” and “electronic morphine” but Australia has a unique relationship with the machines since they were first made legal in 1956. \n“I was very interested to know about this creeping reality for so many people,” producer Mitzi Goldman tells news.com.au. “I really had no idea of the extent (of pokie addiction).” \nMs Goldman became involved with the documentary Ka-Ching! Pokie Nation four years ago after it was brought to her by fellow producer Neil Lawrence, who died suddenly in July this year, just days after it was finished. \nShe says the filmmaking process amounted to be a “shocking realisation” of the insidiousness of modern-day pokie machines and the predatory industry that’s pulling the lever.
