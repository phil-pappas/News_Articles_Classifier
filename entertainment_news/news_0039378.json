The poems “Lover’s Prayer,” “Lover’s Thanks,” “Lover’s Questions,” “Response,” and “Soulmate,” describe the openness between two lovers. “Celestial” tells of a love that is unattainable.\nSays the author, “In my poetry, I, the writer, search for answers to life’s questions.”\nAbout the Author: Walter N.
