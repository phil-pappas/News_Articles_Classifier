Two zombies round a bend up ahead, which the parents calmly disregard as they focus on trying to start the car — but then they're surprised by more walkers from behind. Enid starts to shriek, and we cut jerkily to the gory aftermath: Enid looking through blood-streaked windows at a walker eating the remains of her parents.\nWe get a silent montage of the girl learning to survive on her own and becoming the self-assured loner that we're familiar with in Alexandria — complete with her tearing a turtle's head off and eating it raw. (I wonder if eating gross things is a rite of passage for \"The Walking Dead\" cast — Daryl gnawing on bugs, Rick gnawing on human necks, etc.)\nShe repeatedly scrawls the letters JSS — in the dirt, on the dusty window of an abandoned car, with turtle bones, on the grime caking her hands — but we won't learn what the letters stand for until her Dear John letter at the end of the episode.\nWhen she finally stumbles across Alexandria, she hesitates outside the barricade — reminding me strongly of Rick and Daryl at their most feral when this group first arrived — and turns her back on the chatter and the laughter wafting over the walls. She ultimately decides to go in, but you get the feeling she's not planning on planting any roots. And from what we've seen of her character so far — sneaking out over the wall and roaming through the woods alone, and barely speaking to the others — she's never fully re-acclimated to civilization.\nBut you know who has, and brilliantly? Carol, wearing a floral sweater set over a lavender blouse, who's trading recipes and barbs with the Real Housewives of Alexandria in the pantry. These women are wowed by Carol's kitchen creations with the staples no one wants, like celery soup and water chestnuts. If only they knew what she can do with a blood-splattered poncho and a couple of fireworks! Eat your heart out, Martha Stewart.\nShe gets in a good dig at Shelly — the woman who will not shut up about how much she misses her pasta maker, and who is turning up her nose at Carol's casserole because it has — gasp — paprika in it. Carol kindly offers to teach Shelly how to make pasta without fancy gadgetry, but then she dips lightly into Scarol mode:\n\"I could teach you how to make pasta with your own two hands, if you promise not to smoke in the house. It's just a disgusting habit,\" she says brightly, adding, \"It kills you, and if you ask me, there's too many things trying to do that already!\"\nAlas, she eats her words not long after. Carol has just prepped her casserole and popped it in the oven to cook for an hour. Carl has just come back from walking Judith, and the baby is down for a nap upstairs. So Carol looks idly out the window, and sees Shelly is outside smoking those filthy cigarettes again. Until she's not, because suddenly a raggedy man comes out of nowhere and starts hacking her with a machete.\nThings fall apart fast.\nMolotov cocktails come exploding over the wall, taking out the guard and starting fires on the street. Filthy men and women wrapped in drab, tattered clothing and with \"W\"s either drawn or carved on their foreheads start coming over the wall and attacking the surprised Alexandrians with knives, axes, scythes and machetes.\nOne thing that becomes clear in the chaos: the Alexandrians are wholly unprepared for any kind of attack. Most of them panic, including the psychologist being tasked with stepping up as community surgeon, as well as Deanna, who doesn't even COME INSIDE HER OWN WALLS as her people are being slaughtered, because she says she'll just be one more person to save.\nBut the interloping Grimes Gang coolly takes control of the situation, and never doubt that they are going to beat back the intruders.\nCarl stays in the house to take care of Judith. Enid joins him — she had been coming by to say good-bye, she says — but Carl persuades her to stay and help him protect the baby. \"Nobody is getting inside this house.\"\nBut Enid says something odd, which may lend some credence to the people who think she's connected to The Wolves somehow, although we didn't see them in her flashback: \"They're just people,\" she says to Carl. But she agrees to help, for now. They sit back-to-back on the floor, and Carl asks her not to say goodbye again. She won't.\nNext door, Jessie locks herself and her youngest in a closet upstairs that has a bolt on the inside; you realize this is where they used to hide when Pete would get drunk and hurt them, which is really disturbing. She's clutching a gun and worrying about her other son Ron.\nRon gets attacked right outside, but Carl runs out and shoots the Wolf that's after him. In a really pivotal moment, the Wolf — who doesn't look much older than Carl — begs him not to kill him. You remember when a younger, more trigger-happy Carl gunned down an unarmed kid outside the prison? Well, we've come a long way; Carl actually hesitates and shows mercy here, but it's the wrong call. The Wolf suddenly springs up and almost gets him. Carl kills him, but you've gotta wonder — is Alexandria making him soft, just as he was worried about last season? And is that a bad thing?\nHe asks Ron to come inside, but Ron spurns his help — Carl's dad did kill his dad, after all. So Carl and Enid go back in the house, and Ron runs next door to his mom and brother.\nCarol comes across a Wolf disemboweling one of her housewife friends, and she kills it before hugging and then mercy-killing her friend. She surveys the chaos, blood on her hands and on her sweater. She sees a Wolf draw a \"W\" on his head with Shelly the late-smoker's blood, and she sees other Wolves leading prisoners around in chains. She takes mental notes.\nDeanna and Maggie had been outside the main gates in an adjacent area where they plan to expand their community. Deanna's remaining son Spencer is standing guard outside in the watchtower as Alexandria comes under attack, and a semi-truck driven by one of The Wolves plows into the tower. This results in the blaring horn that disrupted Rick's carefully laid plan to lead the walker horde away.\nMorgan eventually arrives and deactivates the horn, but the damage has been done — not too far away, a few thousand walkers have heard it, and they are now slouching their way toward the ravaged town. Both Deanna and Spencer are in shock, so Maggie and Morgan leave them to hide in the semi.\nInside the walls, the Wolves are in a killing frenzy that is terrifying because it doesn't seem to have any motive or reason. They're not trying to take over the town and use its resources, a la the Governor. They're not trying to eat these people like the Termites. They are just delighting in destruction. Morgan comes across a Wolf with an axe that is just gleefully chopping a corpse's legs.\nGene Page/AMC Lennie James as Morgan Jones on ‘The Walking Dead.’ Crazy axe guy spies Morgan, and considers him. \"Quick. Slow.\"\nMorgan calmly replies, \"Leave. Please.\"\nAxe guy attacks, promising Morgan's death is \"gonna be slow\" when a hooded figure wearing a bandana over its face runs up and kills the Wolf with a knife, like a ninja.\nShe throws the hood back, and it's freakin' Carol, who's wrapped herself up in some Wolf's rags and painted a \"W\" in blood on her forehead. Genius. She's about to go full-Terminus on these guys.\nBut Morgan is pissed that she intervened, and even more pissed that she killed the Wolf.\n\"You don't have to kill people,\" he says to Carol, feeding the same lines he was just giving Rick the day before. But she tersely replies, \"Of course we do,\" and drafts him to help her defend the armory. She loosely binds him in chains, pretending he's her prisoner, and then covers her face and head up once more, hiding in plain sight as they move amongst their enemies.\nTheir key advantage here is that the Wolves don't have guns, so the Alexandrians can turn this around with their more advanced weapons. Carol gets to the armory, where the woman in charge is — you guessed it — hiding. The woman in charge of the guns also has no idea how to shoot one. So Carol gives her a quick tutorial along the lines of \"stick them with the pointy end\" and grabs herself a sack of weapons before dashing outside.\nWhere she finds Morgan has just rescued Rev. Stokes from a Wolf, but rather than kill him, he's tying him up.\nThe Wolf blinks at them in confusion, and says, \"We're freein' you. The trap. You need to know, people don't belong here anymore...\" but then Carol kills him before he can say more. She gives Morgan a gun and then takes off. Morgan passes the gun over to the Reverend. \"I'm not very good with guns,\" says Stokes. \"Me neither,\" says Morgan.\nThe Wolves have completely sacked Alexandria. There's blood running down the pretty white steps of one house's porch. There's bodies and body parts sprawled all over the main street, and smoke still billowing where the fires have been tamped out. Rosita and Aaron are now moving through the wreckage and taking out the remaining Wolves they find, and making sure all of the dead have been stabbed in the head. Carol goes back to the crazy machete wielder, who is still hacking what's left of Shelly the cigarette-smoking ma'am, and she kills him. The sounds of gunfire popping and people screaming have replaced the cheerful birds singing from earlier.\nMorgan walks toward the fence, which is open, and is suddenly surrounded by several Wolves — including one of the ones he met in the woods last season. He showed mercy by not killing him, but rather, leaving him in a car with its horn blaring for the walkers to find. Looks like he got out.\n\"YOU,\" the Wolf says, recognizing him. \"You live here?\"\nMorgan tries talking sense with him. These people in Alexandria have guns. The Wolves do not, so the Wolves should leave or else they are all going to die.\nHe knocks out a few Wolves with his staff, but he's focused on psyching out the leader, convincing him there is a sniper rifle trained on him as they speak. \"It's gonna happen any second now, unless you get the hell out of here and you don't ever come back,\" Morgan says. \"You keep choosing this life, you will die.\"\nTo which the head Wolf replies, \"we didn't choose,\" and the remaining attackers run out the gate — although one stops to pick up a gun off the ground on his way out. Bad move, Morgan. You shouldn't have let that go. I am willing to bet that this gun in the hands of the Wolves is going to have dire consequences later on this season.\nBut don't think Morgan doesn't have it in him to kill. He walks into one of the houses — I thought it was the armory, and I was really worried that the woman hiding behind the door was going to shoot him. But there is one lone Wolf waiting for him in the living room, instead. With a scythe. They duke it out, and Morgan apologizes before taking his life.\nThen we're left with everyone taking stock of what just happened. Denise the pseudo-surgeon is devastated that her first patient is lying dead on the table. Tara and Eugene try comforting her — and, you know, reminding her that she's got to stab the brain to make sure the deceased doesn't come back. Because killing your patient, twice, is exactly what the doctor ordered. Aaron finds his knapsack in the hands of one of the dead Wolves, and is stricken when he realizes that his photographs inside it are what led the attackers here. Carol grabs one of Shelly's cigarettes and sits on her porch, with tears rolling down her face. Morgan is right — Carol really doesn't *like* killing, either. Spencer and Deanna want to know how Maggie and Rosita have been able to keep on keepin' on if this is what the world is like. And Carl hears a door open and close, and finds a note from Enid on the floor. She has left without saying good-bye.\n\"Just Survive Somehow,\" her note says, decoding what her \"JSS\" mantra stands for. The remaining Alexandrians and our friends had better take those words to heart, as there may be thousands of zombies from Rick's thwarted rerouting plan making a z-line for Alexandria.\nOr are they? Why haven't Rick and Michonne returned yet?\nAnd then comes the kicker: Carol's kitchen timer for the casserole goes off, revealing that this entire attack and its aftermath has happened in less than an hour.\nWhen things fall apart, they fall fast.\nLast Gasps:\nRelated Stories 'The Walking Dead' season six: stars dish the gory details MSG hosts 'The Walking Dead' sixth season premiere ‘The Walking Dead’ recap: Season six premiere Tags: tv recaps , the walking dead , andrew lincoln , norman reedus , lauren cohan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:07:50.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
