It took me long enough,” the American rock star said during the concert.\nHe dedicated a new song, “We Don’t Run,” released during the summer, to Israelis, saying: “This one I think should be the fight song for all of Tel Aviv. It’s called We Don’t Run.”\nThe concert opened less than an hour after a stabbing attack in Jerusalem left two Jewish-Israeli men dead.\nBon Jovi came under pressure from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, most notably from Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, to cancel the concert.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWgX739JLdc"], "published": "2015-10-06T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:14:02.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
