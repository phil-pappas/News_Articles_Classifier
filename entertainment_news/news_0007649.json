Marauding bands rape, rob and kill. Murders go uninvestigated, and “only rich people can afford to have police.” Most of them have left the crumbling country, to live offshore on “tax-free sea platforms.”\nThere’s no such plush platform awaiting Stan and Charmaine, hardworking Americans who married each other because it was safe, in a world where nothing is sure. But when they lose their jobs and then their home and begin living out of a car, their seemingly solid, if stolid, marriage begins to fray.\nMore Information The Heart Goes Last: A Novel\nBy Margaret Atwood\nNan A. Talese, $26.95\nThat makes them easy marks for the Orwellian types running the town of Consilience and its prison, Positron. Those who choose to move there get to spend six months each year in comfy homes. But every other month must be spent as a Positron inmate. One’s “civilian” home is shared with a second couple, who occupy it during the months one spends in the slammer.\nIt’s not quite as bizarre as it sounds — not when one considers the number of Americans working toxic, dead-end jobs involving too many hours and too little money, all so they can spend their remaining hours in the homes for which they work. We trade freedom for apparent security. Every day.\nAtwood has been exploring how that trade-off works — as well as just what sorts of trades we’re willing to make — for a long time, especially in the novel to which this one is bound to be compared: “The Handmaid’s Tale” (1985), in which the theocracy of Gilead enslaves women in the name of protecting them.\nThe Positron Project, as it’s called, adapts a similarly cloying, creepy and ultimately controlling approach toward its subjects. To “avoid overexcitement,” there’s no rock, hip-hop or porn. The 1950s have been chosen “for the visual and audio aspects,” because people then were allegedly happier.\nThere’s technology, but it all operates on a closed circuit; one can’t communicate with the outside world. And after entering this world, one isn’t permitted to leave. Ever.\nBut unlike “The Handmaid’s Tale” — a richer book with much more textured characters — “Heart” often seems to exist within an airless bell jar, under which characters like Stan, Charmaine and everyone else enact a contrived and cartoonish plot, unspooled with a jaunty, even snarky insouciance.\nIt’s as though Atwood can’t quite bring herself to take these characters seriously. Or, perhaps, she’s trying to convey what happens when we reduce people to commodities — capable, here, of being continually repurposed and repackaged. Are we, as one character asks, no more than a few plasticized features and gestures? If so, what makes us human? And if so, can literature matter?\nInteresting philosophical questions, but the way they’re presented here undermines what could have been a much better novel. Instead we get satire that’s too broad to bite and too self-consciously clever for readers to care.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/75/8777557/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/75/8777557/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:49:47.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
