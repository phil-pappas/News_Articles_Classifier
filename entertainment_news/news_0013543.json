Deadline suggests Wheeler will work from their draft. \nReleased in 1974 in Japan as Micromen, the toy line was imported to the United States two years later by the Mego Corporation and renamed “Micronauts.” Marvel began publishing licensed Micronauts comics in 1979, fleshing out the story of the microscopic Microverse and a team brought together to oppose the dictator Baron Karza. \nThe initial Marvel series ended in 1984, followed by reprints, a miniseries, and a second volume that ran from 1984 to 1986. Image Comics and Devil’s Due Publishing each briefly resurrected the comics license in the early 2000s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:16:18.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
