However, the third-highest prize, which is won by matching four white balls and the Powerball, will increase from $10,000 to $50,000. \nAlso changing is the Power Play option, which currently allows most prizes to be multiplied up to five times for an extra $1 per ticket. \nUnder the new rules, when the jackpot is $150 million or less, the Power Play option will multiply most prizes by two, three four, five or 10 times. When the jackpot is above $150 million, the highest multiplier will be five. \nPower Play does not apply to jackpots. The prize for matching the five white balls but not the Powerball will continue to double to $2 million if a player chooses the Power Play option. \nPowerball drawings will continue to be held at 9:59 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:39:35.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
