(LOS ANGELES) -- Khloe Kardashian's legal team has called off her divorce proceedings with Lamar Odom, ABC News has confirmed. \nKardashian's lawyer filed the dismissal Wednesday at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, said Los Angeles County Superior Court PIO Mary Hearn. She filed for divorce in December 2013. \nHearn said that after filing a dismissal, the divorce proceedings are automatically halted. \n“This is a very delicate and difficult time for both Lamar and Khloe, and the most sensible thing to do at such a time is not make any big moves and put everything on hold,\" said a source close to the situation. \"So that’s what she is doing.” \nKardashian and Odom married in 2009, but split four years later after months of alleged drug use and infidelity. But after Odom was found unconscious last week at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, Kardashian has been by his bedside. \nOdom was recently transported to a hospital in Los Angeles to continue his recovery, and Kardashian was photographed in his company. \nAdditionally, the reality star recently released a statement on her website, thanking fans for their support and prayers as Odom recovers from his hospitalization. \n\"You can never be prepared for an experience like this, but without the outpouring of love and endless prayers that Lamar has received and the strength I was given from my loved ones, it would have been difficult to endure,\" she wrote. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:20:52.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
