The subjects usually dealt with the strange or supernatural, without death or violence - just straight-up scary topics to thrill kids.But do the books by R.L. Stine hold up nearly 20 years after they were first popular? We had a look back, without the nostalgia goggles, and came up with the five best and five worst of the series. The best of the series \"MONSTER BLOOD\" What it's about: Evan visits an old novelty shop and buys a can of \"surprising miracle substance.\" The substance, monster blood, grows and grows until Evan realizes this might be a problem. Why it's scary: A little cheesy, and yes, it borrows heavily from \"The Blob.\" Plus, as a kid, didn't you want a toy that grew? Or was that just me? Maybe not, because the book caught on, launching a side series. \"THE HAUNTED MASK\" What it's about: After being a prank victim one too many times, Carly Beth buys a terrifying Halloween mask - one that feels strangely like human skin. When she realizes it is making her aggressive, she finds she can't remove it and chaos ensues. Why it's scary: Masks are pretty creepy and the thought of losing control of yourself is even more terrifying. And clearly the book resonated, as it was followed up with a trio of sequels. \"THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DUMMY II\" What it's about: Amy gets a new dummy from a pawnshop for her ventriloquist act, and the dummy turns out to be pretty evil. Moral of the story: Never read strange words found inside the suit of a ventriloquist dummy, especially if they are, \"karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano.\" Why it's scary: Dolls have a history in the horror genre of being scary. When you think of a doll coming to life, you hope it will be your friend. But what if it isn't? If there was a character from \"Goosebumps\" that I would consider the series' mascot, it would be Slappy the evil dummy. Like \"Monster Blood,\" \"Dummy\" launched a spin-off series. \"STAY OUT OF THE BASEMENT\" What it's about: Margaret and Casey begin noticing their scientist father starts acting strangely when he's fired from his job. He doesn't allow them into the basement. He never takes off his baseball cap. And he tries to feed them some sort of green food. And things just get stranger. Why it's scary: As a kid, what's scarier than your parents changing into something else - and turning on you? \"THE HORROR AT CAMP JELLYJAM\" What it's about: When Wendy and Elliot are separated from their parents in the \"Wyoming countryside,\" they are found by a grinning man, who takes them to King Jellyjam's Sports Camp. All is well - until they discover children keep disappearing from the camp. Why it's scary: Being separated from your parents in a strange setting is scary enough. But being in a strange place where they make you play sports all day? There's nothing more terrifying. The worst of the series \"EGG MONSTERS FROM MARS\" What it's about: Dana finds a strange green egg during an egg hunt. It hatches and out plops a creature resembling scrambled eggs with eyes. Why it flops: Alien invasion stories can be scary. But scrambled egg creatures from Mars? This is just ridiculous. \"BAD HARE DAY\" What's it about: Young Tim and his best friend get tickets to see Tim's favorite magician, the terribly named Amaz-O. Tim steals Amaz-O's bag of tricks and turns his sister into a rabbit. Why it flops: A tale of misusing power can be scary. But this book is actually pretty boring. It has an unbelievably slow pace, and nothing really happens until the end. \"MY BEST FRIEND IS INVISIBLE\" What it's about: When strange things begin happening around the house, Sammy discovers an invisible 12-year-old named Brent has been causing all of the trouble. But it's only because he wants to be best friends with Sammy. Why it flops: A confusing twist, obnoxious characters and a mother's baffling move to turn her monster son invisible - to make him more likeable - all add up to one terrible book. \"A SHOCKER ON SHOCK STREET\" What it's about: Erin's father designs a theme park, complete with robotics, and he invites Erin and her best friend to be the first visitors. What goes wrong? Have you seen \"Jurassic Park\"? Why it flops: \"A Shocker on Shock Street\" tries to recreate \"Jurassic Park,\" except with with robots and praying mantises. Somehow, that's just not scary. \"THE BEAST FROM THE EAST\" What it's about: Three siblings, Ginger, Nat and Pat, get lost in the woods and encounter a monstrous 8-foot-tall, bear-like creature with blue fur. Pat escapes, but Ginger and Nat are stuck playing a twisted form of tag with the Beast. Why it flops: There is tree-tickling, confusing game rules and more utter nonsense in this dull and confusing tale.   05:50:24 pm MDT Ellen Fike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:13:26.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
