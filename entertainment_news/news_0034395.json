Or her. \nThe Mockingjay star penned a powerful essay forLena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny about the Hollywood wage gap and the sexism she has experienced -- even as the highest-paid actress out there. She even mentioned that \"it's hard for me to speak about my experience as a working woman because I can safely say my problems aren't exactly relatable,\" but that she felt compelled to speak on the aspects that are. In five short years, Jennifer Lawrence has been catapulted from indie darling to big-budget, big-accolades babe. Here's a look at how America anointed its latest sweetheart. Richard Shotwell, Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Seemingly out of nowhere, Lawrence was nominated for her first Oscar, for best actress, for playing an impoverished girl from the Ozarks in 2010's \"Winter's Bone.\" AP Lawrence won the \"rising star\" award at the 2011 Palm Springs International Film Festival in January. That turned out to be the understatement of the year. Dan Steinberg, AP At the 2011 Oscars in February, Lawrence showed she's a fashion force, too. This slinky Calvin Klein sheath is still hailed has one of her greatest sartorial hits. Bob Riha, Jr., USA TODAY In 2011, Lawrence proved her, um, range by playing sexy supervillain Mystique in \"X-Men: First Class.\" She's reprising the role in 2014 for \"X-Men: Days of Future Past.\" Twitter.com/BryanSinger In 2012, Jennifer Lawrence became synonymous with heroine Katniss Everdeen from \"The Hunger Games,\" doing the character justice, according to critics and fans. Murray Close, Lionsgate Lawrence played Katniss again in 2013's \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\" Lionsgate Lawrence struck best-actress Oscar gold with her 2012 performance as a young widow in \"Silver Linings Playbook.\" The Weinstein Company The most famous face of Dior, Lawrence is also the body of it, at least on the red carpet, including at the 2013 Golden Globes. Jordan Strauss, Invision/AP ... and again at the 2013 Oscars ... Frederic J. Brown, AFP/Getty Images Where she memorably tripped while walking up the stairs to accept her trophy. And she just as memorably brushed off the stumble in her speech. Chris Pizzello, Invision/AP Now firmly and forever JLaw, Lawrence played a hot-tempered, high-haired '70s wife in 2013's \"American Hustle,\" nailing her third Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. Francois Duhamel, Columbia Pictures By November 2013, JLaw had joined Hollywood's pixie posse.

She later confessed to Robin Roberts the daring Dior gown wasn't her \"favorite look.\" Christopher Polk, Getty Images Lawrence strapped herself into her de rigueur Dior for the 2014 Golden Globes. Jason Merritt, Getty Images She also shimmied into it for the 2014 Oscars. And like in her 2013 Academy Award Dior, she tripped in it. Oops! Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY Lawrence is very private about her personal life, but at the 2014 Oscars, her on-off relationship with actor Nicholas Hoult looked very much on. Todd Williamson, Invision/AP Lawrence played a starring role in the Oscars selfie that swept the world in 2014, looking every bit the JLaw the nation knows and loves: slightly goofy, almost giddy.

I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn't want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don't need.\" \nLawrence said that she \"gave up early\" partially because she inherently wanted to be liked and not seen as \"difficult\" or \"spoiled.\": \"At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being 'difficult' or 'spoiled.' This could be a young-person thing. It could be a personality thing. I'm sure it's both. But this is an element of my personality that I've been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don't think I'm the only woman with this issue.\" \nThe actress wrote that it wasn't only in salary negotiations that she has experienced sexism, recalling an incident just a few weeks ago where a man she was working with acted like she over-reacted when she simply spoke her mind bluntly. \"I was so shocked because nothing that I said was personal, offensive, or, to be honest, wrong,\" she said of the incident. \"All I hear and see all day are men speaking their opinions, and I give mine in the same exact manner, and you would have thought I had said something offensive.\" \nLawrence closed the essay by declaring that she is \"over\" trying to find the \"adorable\" and \"likable\" way to speak her mind. \"(Expletive) that,\" she wrote. \"I don't think I've ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It's just heard.\" \nShe continued: \"If anything, I'm sure (actors who negotiated powerful deals) were commended for being fierce and tactical, while I was busy worrying about coming across as a brat and not getting my fair share. Again, this might have NOTHING to do with my vagina, but I wasn't completely wrong when another leaked Sony email revealed a producer referring to a fellow lead actress in a negotiation as a 'spoiled brat.' For some reason, I just can't picture someone saying that about a man.\" \nYou can read Lawrence's full Lenny essay here . \nPHOTOS | Day in Celebrities (L-R) TV personalities Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Kylie Jenner attend Cosmopolitan's 50th Birthday Celebration on October 12, 2015 in West Hollywood, California.
