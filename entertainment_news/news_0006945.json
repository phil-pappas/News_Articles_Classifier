But then SA was spotted being chummy with non-showbiz girls and, well, the balloon got burst. And because CA often denied she was with SA, she could not express her hurt over the matter.\nA few months later, SA ended up with Feisty Talent (FT), who almost risked her career out of her love for him. Did it make SA think twice about fidelity? Apparently not. SA was said to have had a thing going for an older actress, as well as an actress-model, a fan and even a Docile Actress (DA) from another network.\nWhen FT confronted SA about them, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “It’s a man thing.” Like CA, FT has had enough and broke up with SA.\n(Illustration by Rod Cañalita)\nHere’s where it gets interesting: Now that SA and FT lead separate paths in their careers, fate seems to favor FT. There are projects that enable FT to exact revenge on SA if she carries out her alleged plan. A current project of FT involves Someone Wonderful (SW) who happens to be fond of DA. In the past, FT and SW were caught in controversy, but cooler heads clarified matters and SW had to move away. Now, to get back at DA, FT is said to have plans of reviving whatever feelings SW had for her.\nTime will tell if FT will succeed. If, indeed, SW and FT end up with each other, the reactions will have a negative impact on their careers – something SW can’t afford to have as it could cause his downfall. Will revenge always be a thing for the woman scorned?\n“The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.” – Marcus Aurelius\n• • •\nARROGANCE EXPLAINED?\nWhen Cute Actor (CA) finally made it to the big league, the management was surprised with how he would throw his weight around to make other acknowledge his new status.The boastful attitude has turned off his colleagues who have started to avoid him. Eventually, a top executive warned CA to stop being so haughty. Will he heed the advice? We’ll see.\nMany speculate that CA is arrogant because he is compensating for a flaw. Allegedly, CA is lacking in that department despite what his sexy pictorials show. One of his conquests claims so, too.\n“Be careful not to mistake insecurity and inadequacy for humility! Humility has nothing to do with the insecure and inadequate! Just like arrogance has nothing to do with greatness!” – C. JoyBell C.\n• • •\nHIS BLATANT REACTION TO HER CHOICE\nVibrant Hunk (VH) has finally made a name in the business but it comes with a price: he could not fall in love with Mischievous Talent (MT) because fans want him for Cute Actress (CA).\nHowever, love always finds its way even, to the unsuspecting heart. VH is so smitten by MT even though CA was so near. VH and MT has been seeing each other with the latter being a good influence on him who gave up all his vices for her.\nWhen their management teams found out about what’s going on, they warned VH and MT about the possible consequences if the two are found out by the fans. More, the management of MT threatened not to give her any project if she continues seeing him. Alas, love got lost and fear won. MT left VH in the cold.\nWith ego hurt, VH got back at MT by hooking up with people close to her. He got close to her friends and, given the chance, used his charisma to get intimate with them. His alleged exploits are meant to get MT affected. Still, the two will just have to consider each other as the one that got away.\n“If the career you have chosen has some unexpected inconvenience, console yourself by reflecting that no career is without them.” – Jane Fonda\nFollow @FashionPulis on Twitter and @fashionpulis on Instagram.
