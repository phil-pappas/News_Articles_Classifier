By the time she’s 17, she’s had her first baby and is overcome with the intensity of her feelings for him. Time jumps back and forth in this Glass Menagerie -like memory play. One minute Soledad delivers Blu. In the next he’s grown with two younger siblings.\nThe children’s father — gang member Eme, played by Rodney Garza with vulnerability under the machismo — goes to prison when the children are young. Soledad finds lasting love with a woman, Hailstorm (in a tender turn by Edyka Chilomé).\nTogether, Soledad and Hailstorm struggle to keep the children safe in a world where they must pick their way gingerly among the gangs that offer them belonging, violence that keeps them in line, and schools and authorities that treat them with suspicion.\nRené Moreno’s fluid direction of a vibrant cast seamlessly melds gritty action with exuberant dancing choreographed by Michelle N. Gibson. Characters express hard-to-articulate feelings for each other through these mute vignettes, which are performed to the steady tribal drumbeat of Trey Pendergrass’ musical compositions.\nChris Ramirez suggests the conflicted heart of Blu, who is torn between the joy he feels with his family and the sorrows he doesn’t know how to prevent. Edwin Aguilar expresses the confusion of Lunatico, who is unsure what step to take next. Maya Quetzali brings a quiet, mystical strength to Gemini, who tries to help her brothers by divining their connections to something mystical and healing.\nRodney Dobbs’ set, evocatively lit by Linda Blase, contrasts the world they live in, bordered with graffiti, and the elusive one they long for, with a roof where they can sit and marvel at the stars and a moon of Aztec-style carvings overhead.\nMost movingly, the play helps us see the wonder and wasted potential of these wounded children through the eyes of their mother. It makes the difficulties that her children face and she cannot ease all the more wrenching.\nPlan your life\nContinues through Oct. 18 at the Latino Cultural Center, 2600 Live Oak St., Dallas.
