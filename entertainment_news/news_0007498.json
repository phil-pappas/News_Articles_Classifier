By India.com Entertainment Desk on October 18, 2015 at 2:12 PM Comments \nThis piece of juicy info may come as a bit of a surprise if not shocker. Touted as the Gautam Gulati of this season thanks to his looks and his flirtatious persona Ankit Gera, one thought, would be one of the biggest contender for the title. But the fact remains that Gera has been shown the do0r.( ALSO READ: Is Ankit Gera a cheater? ) The announcement will be made tonight. One would have easily assumed that Ankit would stay on thanks to the presence of his ex-girlfriend Roopal Tuagi, but it seems that the duo’s chemistry is not sizzling enough for Bigg Boss to keep the lad in the glass-walled house. We can’t wait to watch tonight’s episode to know if Ankit’s elimination is justified!

And we were curious to know who would walk away with the maximum number of votes and who (red: which pair) would languish at the bottom. Interestingly, Yuvika-Vikas were safe the minute they became the captains of the house. That left Ankit-Arvind, Rimi-Suyyash and Roopal-Digangana in the danger zone. Looks like viewers did not like Ankit and Arvind’s pair in the end. Naturally, Gera had to pack his bags and leave! \nNow you tell us Bigg Boss followers–Do you think his exit is justified? Or should Ankit be called back as the wild-card entry! \n  2:14 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:13:17.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
