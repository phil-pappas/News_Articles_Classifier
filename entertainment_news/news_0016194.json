The attacker, from east Jerusalem, was shot dead by other officers.\nLater in the day, a female attacker stabbed an Israeli policeman near the force's headquarters in Jerusalem and was shot and wounded by the victim, police said.\nIn the third attack, two young Palestinian teenagers stabbed two Israelis in the east Jerusalem settlement of Pisgat Zeev, with one attacker -- a 17-year-old -- killed and the other, 13, shot and seriously wounded.\nThe victims were both Jews, with a 13-year-old who was riding a bicycle critically wounded and a 25-year-old seriously hurt, police said.\n- Growing anger -\nThe violence began on October 1, when an alleged Hamas cell shot dead a Jewish settler couple in the West Bank in front of their children.\nIt followed repeated clashes at Jerusalem's flashpoint al-Aqsa mosque compound in September between Israeli security forces and Palestinian youths.\nThe unrest has spread to the Gaza Strip, hit by three wars with Israel since 2008. Clashes along the border left nine Palestinians dead from Israeli fire on Friday and Saturday.\nOn Sunday, an Israeli air strike in retaliation for two rockets fired at Israel demolished a house in northern Gaza, killing a woman and her two-year-old daughter.\nIsrael said the air strike targeted two arms workshops of Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules the Gaza Strip.\nPalestinian frustration has mounted with efforts towards statehood at a standstill and Israel's occupation continuing, and a recent opinion poll found a majority favor a return to armed uprising in the absence of peace talks.\nFunerals of Palestinians killed during unrest or while allegedly carrying out attacks -- as well as videos of the shootings -- have fed anger.\nOn Monday, children with plastic guns mixed among hundreds of others who carried the body of Ahmed Sharake, a 13-year-old, during his funeral procession at the turbulent Jalazone refugee camp.\nHe was killed on Sunday during clashes in Ramallah.\n\"He left without telling me,\" his mother Huda told AFP. \"I saw on television that someone was killed and it was only afterward that somebody told me that it was Ahmed.\"\nClashes erupted at a checkpoint near Ramallah after the funeral.\n- More than 1,000 wounded -\nAround 25 Palestinians have been killed amid the unrest, including alleged attackers.\nProtests has seen Palestinians throwing stones and firebombs at Israeli forces, who have responded with live fire, rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades.\nThe Red Crescent said Sunday that 1,021 Palestinians have been wounded by live fire and rubber bullets since October 3.\nVideos posted online of Israeli officers shooting dead alleged knife attackers have galvanized Palestinian youths, who see the killings as unjustified.\nPalestine Liberation Organization secretary general Saeb Erekat lashed out at Netanyahu after his parliament speech, saying \"executions\" and harassment from Jewish settlers have exacerbated the violence.\nIn Vienna, Palestinian foreign minister Riad al-Malki accused Israel of inciting the violence.\n\"Netanyahu wants to instigate a third intifada. He wants to avoid problems that he is facing in the political and diplomatic arena, where he has failed miserably,\" Malki told AFP in Vienna.\nNetanyahu called on Abbas to stop what he called Palestinian incitement and to condemn attacks.\nBoth Netanyahu and Abbas have sought to avoid an escalation, but frustrated Palestinian youths have defied efforts to restore calm.\nIsrael also said Monday that YouTube had taken down Palestinian videos that the Jewish state considered to be \"inciting murder.\"\nVideos of Palestinians stabbing Israelis or calling for such attacks as well as footage of protesters throwing stones at Israeli soldiers have been shared on the Internet, in addition to the shooting footage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:56:42.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
