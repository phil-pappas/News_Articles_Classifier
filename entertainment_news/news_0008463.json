Â© AMC / Frank Ockenfels 3Lennie James as Morgan and Andrew Lincoln as Rick \"There is adversity in terms of where the two men stand now,\" James revealed to Digital Spy and others, teasing that the new season will see Rick and Morgan's standpoints reversed from their last meeting in season three, where Morgan was \"a lost soul\" and Rick was trying to give him hope. \"Morgan has obviously found himself in a different place than he was last time we met him, and in season six we'll find out what that transition was.\"As far as Morgan is concerned now, all life is precious. And he's brought that to the group at a time when Rick is trying to convince the Alexandrians that if you're gonna live, you have to kill. Those two ideologies are gonna come into conflict and walk side by side throughout season six.\"The Walking Dead season six will premiere on AMC in the US this Sunday (October 11), and on Fox in the UK the following evening (October 12).Watch a clip of Rick and Morgan in season three below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:39:05.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
