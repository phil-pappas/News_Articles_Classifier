Enrique Serrano is calling for a boycott for the movie that has been garnering buzz from critics and alike. \"Sicario\", meaning \"hitman\" in Spanish, is set in Juarez. In the lawless border area stretching between the U.S. and Mexico, an idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by an elite government task force official to aid in the escalating war against drugs. Serrano is unhappy with how the movie depicts his city. According to XHIJ-TV, Serrano said he wasn't against the movie but rather protesting the way producers portrayed the city in it. He claimed what happened in the movie was in the city's past and he had worked hard to clean up that image. Serrano also told reporters that he was considering suing the producers of the film for continuing to portray it as a lawless place. \"Sicario\" director Denis Villeneuve said previously that they had to shoot in new Mexico because they could only conduct aerial shots in Juarez. He said, \"Juarez is still one of the most dangerous cities on earth.\" He did note that the movie was not based on real events. \"The movie is total fiction. It's like anticipation - it could happen but it hasn't,\" he said. The movie has opened in limited theaters and will go nationwide this week. It won't hit Mexican screens until December 11. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Sicario News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:22:43.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
