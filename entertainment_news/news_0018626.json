On our watch, the United States has become the incarceration nation. Call it the New Jim Crow, the prison industrial complex, the war on drugs, or pseudo slavery. But know this; our country now has just 5% of the world's population, but an astounding 25% of its prisoners.\nTo give you some context, the United States has 2.3 million prisoners while China, which has a billion more residents than the land of the free and the home of the brave, has just 1.5 million prisoners.\nIt's growing, it's outrageously expensive (at $74 billion per year, which is more than the GDP of 133 countries), and in spite of our knee-jerk reaction to call the system broken, it's not broken at all. Instead, the system is operating just how lawmakers and lobbyists, whose loved ones hardly ever suffer the wrath of the monster they've created, intended it to operate.\nJails and prisons should be seen as the modern day American Frankenstein and the question of who built the system and how we dismantle it should begin with something that should blow your mind.\nHave you ever studied the science of prison sentencing?\nRIKERS GUARD GETS 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR RUNNING DRUG SMUGGLING OPERATION\nLet me rephrase that question. Have you ever read an article that methodically explains how certain crimes came to have certain lengths of incarceration as punishment? You can Google that all you want. It doesn't really exist — not in a way that makes any kind of sense — because prison sentencing, in what most states curiously call their ‘departments of corrections’ isn't based on any logical scientific framework, but is based more on first-grade mathematics.\nMy wife has taught first grade for most of our adult lives. One of the things she teaches her students is how to count in multiples of five.\nYou know what I mean, right? Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, and so on.\nMultiples of five are deeply ingrained in American culture and carries over into our money, how we tell time, how much items cost, and more. When I began digging, I soon learned that the overwhelming majority of prison sentences are given in multiples of five — not because a blue-ribbon panel determined that when the average human being spends five years on Rikers Island for stealing a backpack that it is statistically likely to positively correct the path of life that person was on, but prison sentences are doled out in fives because that's how we like to count.\nEdward Jones was given 15 years for having seven shotgun shells in a drawer in his house in Tennessee. Because he had been convicted of a crime 20 years ago, the shotgun shells were a violation of his release terms. Marissa Alexander received a 20-year prison sentence in Florida for firing warning shots at her abusive husband.\nGetty Images/iStockphoto/Getty Images/iStockphoto Dr. Elizabeth Clark-Polner, a neuroscientist and post-doctoral fellow at Yale Law School, made it clear that the science behind prison sentencing just doesn't add up. What's the most common prison sentence given out to someone convicted for a serious felony? It's 25 to life. Sharanda Jones, a non-violent first time drug offender, comes to mind. She was given 25 years to life in federal prison for being the middle person in a Texas drug deal.\nWhy 25? Surely someone, somewhere, some kind of expert determined that 25 years in Angola was the exact punishment needed for a serious crime, right? Nah.\nTwenty-five is the most common multiple of five used in America. In currency, it represents our biggest coin, the quarter, and 25 is one of those common American multiples and children learn it early. Quick, how much money do you have if you have five quarters?\nUP TO 6,000 FEDERAL PRISONERS, MOSTLY DRUG OFFENDERS, WILL BE RELEASED EARLY\nLadies and gentlemen, we’re sending people to prison in multiples of five because that's how we learned to count when we were kids.\nSpeaking with Dr. Elizabeth Clark-Polner, a neuroscientist and post-doctoral fellow at Yale Law School, she made it abundantly clear that the science behind sentencing just doesn't add up.\nHowever we think about punishment — be it as a deterrent of potential future crime, or retribution for crime already committed — we have to make predictions as to its psychological potency (i.e. the degree to which it will be an undesirable experience). The more negative a given punishment — the supposition goes — the more influential it will be in preventing crime (if we’re thinking about deterrence), and the more appropriate it will be for more serious transgressions (if we’re focused on deterrence). In other words, you’re less likely to rob a bank, if the prison sentence for doing so is 25 years, versus 15.\nUnfortunately, there is little evidence that our current methods for assessing the efficacy of punishment options are any good. In predicting the psychological potency of punishment options, policymakers, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges typically rely on their instincts and intuition. A large literature of psychological and economic research, however, has demonstrated that we’re largely insensitive to increases in punishments. Ten years in prison, in other words, does not seem “twice as bad” as five.\nIn other words, not only does our current system lack compassion, it lacks sound science and common sense. We winged it and now we have millions of men and women in prison who are serving outrageously harsh sentences because we didn't really feel like addressing the problem with the critical intelligence and fairness it deserves.\nThis is America in 2015 (a multiple of five).\nRelated Stories Judge urged to send former Bloomberg official to prison Mom-son wanted in Mets fan beating outside Dodger Stadium Ex-housing official gets 3 years in prison for bribes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:03:13.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
