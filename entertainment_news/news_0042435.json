Directed by Kirsten Sanderson. \nWith Alison Fraser, Caissie Levy, Barbara Walsh, Betsy Morgan and Rachel Bay Jones. \nSchedule: 7 p.m. Tuesday through Friday; 1 and 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. \nTickets: $65.212-967-7555, or publictheater.org. \nIn the early 1990s, composer-lyricist Michael John LaChiusa wrote \"First Lady Suite,\" a kind of fantasy chamber musical that explored the thoughts of three presidents' wives, Eleanor Roosevelt, Mamie Eisenhower and Jacqueline Kennedy. \nHis new four-part, opera-style musical, \"First Daughter Suite,\" which opened Wednesday night at the Public Theater, is a companion piece of sorts, although the title is misleading. \nIt's less about presidential offspring than it is their relationships with their more interesting mothers, continuing LaChiusa's fascination with first ladies. The territory covered by the show, which varies in effectiveness, is fairly familiar. \nThe first segment is set in the White House on Tricia Nixon's wedding day, with the president's daughter (Betsy Morgan) throwing a hissy fit because the threat of rain might sabotage her planned outdoor ceremony, while sister Julie (Caissie Levy) teases her. \nBut the piece really focuses on the plight of mother Pat Nixon (Barbara Walsh), who observes from a couch, put upon and somewhat distant, worrying about her husband, while being taunted by her disapproving mother-in-law, Hannah Nixon (Theresa McCarthy). All she wants, Pat sings, is a single moment of true happiness. \nIn the second, most adventurous if slightly ragged segment, Amy Carter (Carly Tamer) dreams that she, along with Gerald Ford's rambunctious daughter Susan (Morgan), accompanied by their mothers, Rosalynn Carter (Rachel Bay Jones) and Betty Ford (a welcomely funny Alison Fraser) sail on the presidential yacht to Iran to rescue the hostages. \nThe third part, the only one that's largely spoken rather than sung, depicts an uneasy reunion between an ice-cold Nancy Reagan (Fraser, again excellent) and her estranged, irritatingly whiny daughter Patti Davis (Levy). \nIn the fourth piece, LaChiusa goes in for some pop psychologizing, with Barbara Bush (Mary Testa) bemoaning her \"mediocre\" son George, and suggesting that the death of his younger sister Robin (McCarthy) at the age of 3, when George was 7 — and his parents' response to the death — might have made him the man he became. \n\"First Daughter Suite\" is very well sung, and has been nimbly directed in its varying moods by Kirsten Sanderson. And wig designer Robert-Charles Vallance superbly pinpoints the first ladies by their hairstyles. \nBut, although an interesting example of serious musical theater, it's seldom compelling. You keep wondering why LaChiusa didn't include Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, which might have at least supplied a sense of immediacy. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:55:06.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
