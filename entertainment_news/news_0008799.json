It's a real thing, you guys, and it's definitely, unequivocally the last thing you want to deal with when you're pregnant. \nBeing shamed for having a bun in the oven seems absolutely ridiculous. And our newly pregnant spirit animal, Chrissy Teigen , is officially not having any of it. \nNegative comments are unfortunately part of living in the limelight, but growing the gift of life is no time to have to deal with haters. \nTeigen is one of the few celebs who truly speaks her mind on social media, from joking about her daily pizza intake to advocating for McDonald's to start serving fries earlier. So when she decided to start sharing her prego pics with the world, we were all #blessed. \nWe got a first look at her baby bump Sunday when she Instagrammed a side shot of her belly with the caption \"Somebody is early to the party.\" \nPeople started tweeting about how she has such a big bump for having just announced. Except no, she is three months pregnant , and those dissenters have officially ruined it for all of us. \nAfter calling out several rude comments, Teigen tweeted, \"No more preg tweeting for me, lesson learned! Back to food and reality TV and hay things.\" \nSince when is it OK to hate on pregnant women? It's not just celebs who have to deal with this issue, and pregnancy shaming doesn't just happen when a woman gains a lot of weight. \nOne Australian news anchor told her critics to \"get stuffed\" after a tabloid posted shots of her walking around town. \n\"When you're pregnant you do feel very vulnerable and self-conscious about your body. But then I thought: You know what? Bugger it — I'm growing a baby. I want to say to the haters, 'Get stuffed,'\" Sarah Harris said on Studio 10. \nOn the flipside, model Sarah Stage received massive criticism for being too fit during her pregnancy. \nShe told Entertainment Tonight , \"I'm just trying to stay positive. It's hard enough to be pregnant.\" \nYou can say that again. And, to all those pregnancy shamers out there — how do you think you got here?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:19:28.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
