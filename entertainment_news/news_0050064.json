The 23-year-old singer shows her bare butt, sitting on the edge of a bathtub, then steps into the tub and covers her breasts with her hands. \"What does it mean to be confident? It means letting go, being authentic, saying I don't give a f--- and this is who I am. I want to show the side of me that's real, that's liberated, that's free,\" Lovato told the magazine. \"I thought there was something incredible about the idea of no makeup whatsoever, no clothes and no retouching.\"\n» See the NSFW video at E! News .\nGetting too old for this s---? A \"Lethal Weapon\" TV series is in the works, based on the four movies that starred Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Gibson has long said \"nope\" to doing a revival or a fifth film, so now Fox has ordered a pilot series from writer Matt Miller (\"Forever\"). No word on a cast, but the plot will follow a former Navy SEAL and Texas cop who joins LAPD after his wife and baby's deaths, partnered with a detective \"who must avoid stress at any cost because of a heart condition.\"\n» Read more at Slash Film .\n\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" debuted 25 years ago on Sunday, and Tori Spelling dropped some bombshells to celebrate the anniversary (and the abysmal Lifetime \"Unauthorized Beverly Hills 90210\" movie).

Other shockers: she's only had two plastic surgeries (nose and breasts), she once had a physical fight with Shannen Doherty -- who wore the dress Spelling lost her virginity in for the first \"90210\" cast photo.

The Monday morning release marks the 53rd anniversary of the first Bond film, \"Dr. No.\" The track, first by a male solo singer since Tom Jones' \"Thunderball\" in 1965, is already a hit and the first Bond theme to top the UK charts.\nAnd Hillary Clinton appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" as a bartender named Val, while \"SNL\" Kate McKinnon portrayed the 2016 presidential candidate. \"I'm just so darn bummed,\" McKinnon says as Clinton. \"All anybody wants to talk about is Donald Trump.\" Then Clinton responds by impersonating the GOP front-runner: \"Donald Trump. Isn't he the one that's like 'Oh, you're all losers?'\" The cold open also included host Miley Cyrus and a few not-too-subtle references to Clinton's campaign.
