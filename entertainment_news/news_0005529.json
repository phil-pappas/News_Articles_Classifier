Next month he releases his first album, ahead of a nine-date tour in early 2016. \nPerhaps being so incredibly busy with media work is what inspired him to tackle a more unusual project. \n\"I'm going to embark on an incredible challenge, to follow the path of the Arctic Circle half way around the world in the depths of winter. To uncover a land of breath-taking natural beauty.\" \nSo, what attracted him to the project? \n\"The chief attraction was that I knew next to nothing about the Arctic,\" he explains. \"I knew penguins came from there, so Pingu was basically my greatest authority on the polar landscape. \n\"When I said I was going, one of my sons said, 'Presumably it's all just flat ice?' And I was thinking, 'Er, well, presumably it is.' Of course I knew that wasn't really true. Norway is famously beautiful with a famously dramatic topography. Was excited about the sheer experience of exploring this corner of the globe that I just didn't know at all.\" \nThe first episode begins as Xander travels to Scandinavia, flying into northern Norway on a light aircraft towards Bodo, 10 miles north of the Arctic Circle. To his surprise, pilot John lets him loose on the controls for his first-ever flying lessons. \n\"If I've ever made the mistake of thinking that flying a plane is a bit like driving a car in the sky, I think I've safely put that one to bed,\" laughs Xander. \"It's obviously a much more involved experience. Of course it's not just the le_ and right, it's the up and down bit as well and that's what I found difficult. \n\"I had no warning that this opportunity was coming. Our lovely pilot John just suddenly said 'Ok, I think you should fly the plane now? Ever flown a plane before?' And I said 'Er, no!' It was amazing and a wonderful, wonderful thing to do. I probably flew for about five minutes, just as we crossed the Arctic circle.\" \nXander openly admits he was dreading one of the first tasks on his tour - swimming in the Arctic Ocean. \nBefore taking the plunge, he states: \"Apparently this will help toughen me up for the conditions ahead. I have to say I'm not entirely convinced...I mean, I'm sure it's going to be invigorating. That said, being tasered is probably invigorating. Doesn't mean it's going to be nice.\" \nThankfully, it's not all pain and discomfort for the charming presenter who proves to be an amiable guide through a place few of us will ever get the chance to visit in person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:52:23.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
