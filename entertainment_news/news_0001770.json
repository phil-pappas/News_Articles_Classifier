But the glamorous star didn't wear her pj's out just to be comfortable she was in fancy dress for her baby shower with even little North West... on.aol.com Kim Kardashian had her baby shower one week after it was postponed due to brother-in-law Lamar Odon’s health crisis. The “Keeping With the Kardashians” star was feted by her siblings and pals on Oct. 25, according to Yahoo Celebrity on Sunday. And while the theme really had nothing to do with babies, it was definitely unique.\nPhoto by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Cosmopolitan Kardashian, who is expecting her second child, a baby boy, with husband Kanye West this December, was treated to a shower with a “Troop Beverly Hills” theme. All five of the famous sisters -- Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian and Kendall and Kylie Jenner, as well as Kim's daughter North West -- wore matching striped pajamas to the events. Decorations included teepees with “Troop 332, Beverly Hills, CA” signs on them, and camping gear. Girl Scout cookies were even served at the faux campout.\n“Troop Beverly Hills” is a retro movie about a scout troop called the Wilderness Girls. The 1989 movie starred Shelley Long, Craig T.

Her first shower, when she was pregnant with daughter North West in 2013, made headlines for its elaborate invitation. TMZ posted a pic of the expensive invite, which was delivered to guests via a real music box that featured a spinning ballerina dancing to Kanye’s song “Hey Mama.” The shower was a garden-themed breakfast buffet, and the Kardashian sisters dressed as garden goddesses for the garden chic event.
