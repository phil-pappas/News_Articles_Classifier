Vision: The Verdict, Channel Nine\nPT1M25S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-445ks 620 349 October 9, 2015 - 8:12AM Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Recap: The Verdict was a stinking mess Former Labor leader Mark Latham has used an appearance on national television to declare that western Sydney has a \"Muslim problem\" following the fatal shooting of a civilian police employee outside the NSW Police Force headquarters in Parramatta last week.\nAppearing on Channel Nine's The Verdict on Thursday night, Mr Latham wasted no time in stirring controversy, using his first comments on the new panel show to insist unemployed people in Sydney's west had too much time to sit around in groups \"bitching\" about western culture.\nMark Latham on The Verdict. Photo: Channel Nine \nMr Latham said the problem could be traced back to the 1980s, when large numbers of unskilled Muslims began migrating to Sydney's western suburbs.\nAdvertisement \"Large parts of suburbs have welfare dependency problems and it pains me to say in western Sydney there is a Muslim problem,\" Mr Latham said.\nHe pointed to the backgrounds of Man Monis, the gunman responsible for last year's Martin Place siege, as well as 15-year-old gunman Farhad Jabar, who executed NSW Police civilian employee Curtis Cheng in Parramatta one week ago.\nOpening night: The Verdict Photo: Channel Nine \nMr Latham said Australia had to recognise that \"this is just not radical Islamic ideology, it is also people with too much time on their hands, too many opportunities to sit around in groups, bitching about western culture, bitching about the American President, bitching about the Australian Prime Minister, and getting up to no good\".\nThe best way to counter such a problem was to \"get these people out to work\", Mr Latham said.\n\"Break down the welfare dependency in western Sydney, and in many ways, it is not just a question of stopping radicalisation. How do we promote normality, normalisation in western Sydney so people are making a positive contribution to society?\"\nHis comments were immediately lambasted by fellow panelist and counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a political scholar from Curtin University in Perth.\nDr Aly, whose PhD explored the fear of terrorism among Muslim communities and the broader Australian community, said Mr Latham's comments were simply uninformed.\nShe said Mr Latham was reciting a \"range of very simplistic strings of answers that are always rolled out every time something like this happens, without any understanding of the complexity of the situation\".\nMr Latham fired back, saying Dr Aly was from Perth and therefore did not know about the problems facing western Sydney.\nBut Dr Aly immediately countered: \"With all due respect, do you work with these young people? I work with the young people who have been radicalised or becoming radicalised, in Perth and in Sydney.\"\nDr Aly said the radicalisation of young people was not a socio-economic problem, but affected people from all stratas of society.\n\"It is not a Muslim, western Sydney problem,\" she said.\n\"It is a social problem that is embedded in a range of social issues, and what we are seeing now is not what we saw 10 years ago,\" she said.\n\"It is a rapidly changing environment, it is a rapidly trending and transforming environment, and we cannot continue to rely on those one-liners we were using 10 years ago to explain things 10 years ago. We need to take a much more comprehensive look at what's happening here, and not fall back on these simplistic one-line answers.\"\nThe response to Mr Latham's views on social media was mixed, with some praising his willingness to voice an opinion that was not politically correct.\nOthers suggested his views were uninformed and offensive.\nWith @JacquiLambie & @MarkLatham , #TheVerdict was gutter television, inciting extreme hatred. @karlstefanovic should know better. #auspol \n— Adam Houda (@LawyerAdamHouda) October 8, 2015 I'd say Sydney has a Mark Latham problem #theverdict \n— Hugh Teate (@Tates1994) October 8, 2015 And Mark Latham wonders why he wasn't elected PM. #TheVerdict #facepalm \n— Brent Adams (@brentadams88) October 8, 2015 Mark Latham is on the money with his views on the terrorism debate #TheVerdict \n— Kim Bevan (@KimBevanRealEst) October 8, 2015 Mark Latham for PM, at least he tells the truth swear words & all.\n— steve ascension (@steveascension1) October 8, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:46:17.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
