The culinary event is a partnership between The Louisiana Travel Promotion Association, its local partners, the Louisiana Office of Tourism, and Texas Monthly. \n\"It gives people there a chance to eat outside of their box,\" Naegle said. \"If you're from Alabama, Texas, Mississippi or Florida, you have certain things you eat on a regular basis ... This makes you go outside that box.\" \nNaegle is eager to demonstrate what makes his region's cuisine special. \nCentral Louisiana has experienced a \"green movement\" over the past few years, and Naegle said he is excited to show Austin the healthier side of Louisiana cuisine. \nStephen Naegle, Spirits Food & Friends, Alexandria.

Girouard hopes those will include popular menu items— such as the sweet baby breesus and Cajun eggs benedict — from his downtown Lafayette restaurant. The menu has not been finalized. \n\"These are two different dishes to show how boudin can be used in different ways with different flavors,\" he said. \nHe isn't the only one interested in showcasing regional Louisiana foods. \nShreveport's Anthony Felan plans to showcase Ruston peaches in the dessert portion of his three-course menu at Austin's The Carillon. \nThe dish is a buttermilk custard with peach gelee, cane vinegar soaked peach, bourbon gastrique, graham cracker dust, mint, basil cream and carbonated sugar. It's the end to a special that starts with a cold smoked Gulf Coast yellow tail crudo and offers a chicken fried bacon wrapped rabbit porchetta with red bean cassoulet as the main course. \n\"We're using Louisiana ingredients and doing a modern twist on our food,\" he said. \nThe red bean cassoulet, for instance, is a play on the Louisiana staple red beans and rice, Felan said. \nNine Louisiana chefs are joining forces with select Austin restaurant for the Louisiana Lone Star Restaurant Night on Tuesday.

The first course is a pork belly with crispy Gulf Coast oysters with corn chow-chow and dijon bechamel (a creamy mustard sauce). The second course is Gulf snapper with New Orleans-style barbecue rock shrimp and hearty vegetables. The final course is a pecan pie with dark chocolate napoleon with burnt honey ice cream. \nHe is as eager to collaborate in kitchen as share Louisiana flavors with Texas diners. \n\"Just to be part of another chef's atmosphere is great,\" he said. \"We can learn from how we do things differently, and I can try to take away something from it that I can bring back (to Louisiana).\" Read or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/entertainment/2015/10/09/alexandria-chef-take-austin-restaurant-scene/73631528/ More Stories Oct. 7, 2015, 11:14 p.m. Louisiana Lone Star Restaurant Night Chefs Meet the nine Louisiana chefs participating in the Louisiana Lone Star Restaurant Night.
