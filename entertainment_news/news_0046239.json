It just sums up that I’m this piece of s**t person who is mean,\" Kris said when discussing Caitlyn's interview for the July issue of the magazine during Sunday night's episode of the E! show. \"He can go f**k himself. I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, f**k you, Bruce.\" \nThe former Olympian discussed her 22-year marriage to Kris , claiming the reason behind their 2013 split was \"20 percent was gender and 80 percent was the way I was treated.\" The momager told the magazine there were issues that were rooted in Caitlyn's self-image . \n\"He was married to me and he wasn't who he wanted to be, so he was miserable,\" she said. \"Why would you want to be married and have kids if this is what you wanted since you were a little boy? Why would you not explain this all to me?” \nKris' children rallied around her after the Vanity Fair profile was published. \n“You said, ‘Kris mistreated me,’\" Kim told Caitlyn. \"It sounded like she beat the s**t out of you. You got the fame, but you’re losing your family. It’s your time, but you don’t have to bash us on your way up.” \nMeanwhile, Scott Disick was annoyed that Caitlyn only cared about her Twitter follower count , which skyrocketed to over 1 million in four hours after the debut of her cover. \"I’ll tell you why,\" he said, \"because the greatest athlete of all time turned into a f**king woman! Who cares, though, at the end of the day? That’s important?\" ﻿ ﻿Also on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:47:11.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
