Walking Dead viewers in shock after fan favourite's demise Spoiler alert! Walking Dead viewers in shock after fan favourite's demise \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nFans of The Walking Dead were left in shock as a main character was apparently eaten alive before their eyes in the latest episode screened in the US. \nIn the Thank You episode, viewers watched in horror as fan favourite Glenn Rhee, played by Steven Yeun, succumbed to a herd of walkers in the dramatic last few minutes of the show. \nIn the heart-stopping scene, Glenn and Nicholas (Michael Traynor) climbed on top of a rubbish dumpster to get away from the zombies, with Nicholas saying a final thank you to Glenn before shooting himself in the head. (Charles Sykes/Invision) \nNicholas knocked both of them to the ground where ravenous zombies appeared to start feasting on their intestines, suggesting it was game over for Glenn. \nThe enduring character had managed to survive since the first series and his death sent Twitter fans into mourning and denial. I literally feel like a family member of mine has died. Like GLENN HAS BEEN THERE SINCE DAY 1 YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME AMC \n— Jenna Smith (@jennasmith_3) October 26, 2015 *calls school*Sorry I can't go to school tomorrow There's been a death in the familyR.I.P.

He's alive. They where eating Nick I believe it. #TheWalkingDead @AMCTalkingDead \n— Daryl's Ear Necklace (@EarNecklace_TWD) October 26, 2015 \nHowever, it looks like Glenn may not be gone forever. Theories have emerged about whether he survived the attack, which have been spurred on by the show’s creator Scott Gimple – who promised his story wasn’t over yet. \nIn a statement to companion show Talking Dead, Scott said: “This is a hard story to tell, and when we were planning to tell it we knew our friends at Talking Dead would be talking to you about it, and knowing you’d all be talking and feeling and commiserating, I knew we should say something about it, lest our silence say something we didn’t mean to say or not say. \n“So I’ll say this: In some way, we will see Glenn, some version of Glenn, or parts of Glenn again, either in flashback or in the current story, to help complete the story.” \nFans have theorised that the guts they saw being chowed-down by the zombies could actually have been Nicholas’s, meaning his body fell on top of Glenn’s and saved him – a show of poetic justice after Nicholas tried to murder Glenn last series. (Chris Pizzello/Invision) \nThis could buy him some time, but the sheer number of walkers in the alley makes it unlikely he would have survived. Share article \nIt seems fans might either be looking at a Walker Glenn – if he received a little nip instead of being eaten by the other walkers – or it’s time to accept Glenn really is gone.
