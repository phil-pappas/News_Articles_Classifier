He was seen puffing cigarette while toting around a briefcase, reported Ace Showbiz. McConaughey also filmed a scene with co-star Bryce Dallas Howard.\nBryce looked beautiful in a gold 80s-style dress. The 'Jurassic World' actress sported red lipstick and her hair was styled in small curls. She completed her look with gold accessories, a box clutch and strappy heels.\nDirected by Stephen Gaghan, 'Gold' is based on a true story of the Bre-X Mineral Corporation mining scandal and is set in the early '90s.\nThe film centers on Kenny Wells, a struggling businessman, who is trying to get back on his feet. He later teams up with a luckless geologist (Edgar Ramirez) in an effort to find gold deep in the uncharted jungles of Indonesia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:34:35.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
