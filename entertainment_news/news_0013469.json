Only it’s not the Obama family. Not even the Bidens. It’s America’s other first family — The Kardashians. Instead of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, the cover includes Kris Jenner. And instead of Natasha and Malia, we get Kim, Courtney and Chloe Kardashian, and Kylie and Kendall Jenner. Seriously. Take a look at the cover (above), which contains some mature language. As you might expect, the Internet wasn’t happy with this, according to The Washington Post’s Helena Andrews-Dyer. “So just when you thought Kardashian aggression/fascination had reached its social media peak (Wait, did anyone actually think that was possible?), the reality show biz clan has once again drawn the ire of the whole Internet by doing what they do best: existing,” Andrews-Dyer wrote. Several social media users reacted to the cover, showing their disapproval. Many, like Lakin Starling, a graduate student at the Columbia University Journalism School, feel that the Obama family has earned the right to be called the “First Family,” and that it’s disgraceful for the magazine to give the reality TV stars that title . “The greatness of the Kardashians does not lie in overcoming insurmountable odds to hold rank or position,” Starling wrote for The Huffington Post. “That is something that the Obamas continuously work for and are left with no choice but to defend because despite outside attempts to ignore them in a room where they are rightfully seated, they are America's First Family.\" Still, some Americans support the Kardashians gracing the cover. After all, a Cosmopolitan spokesman told The Washington Post that the cover was a joke. “We are teasing!” a Cosmo spokesman told The Washington Post. “Though who knows, if Kanye runs for president then we may be soothsayers.” Others say the cover works because the Kardashian/Jenner clan is representative of modern American families , according to Bustle’s Michelle McGahan. “Sure, we're not all dripping with money, married to Kanye West, or posting selfie after selfie of our expensive haircuts, but we are a country with interracial marriages, biracial children … divorces, separations, etc,” McGahan wrote. The cover was a way for the magazine to comment on how people flock to see the Kardashians first when it comes to finding the latest trends and understanding pop culture, according to McGahan. Page 2 of 2 - “So, are the Kardashians really \"America's First Family”?” McGahan asked. “Though the official title will forever belong to the presidential kin, in this moment, in celebrity culture, that label perfectly describes the Kardashian-Jenner family.” And even though the cover won't sit well with everyone, McGahan said most Americans will remember that the Obama family is the true first family, and that the cover’s title means very little. “Should Cosmo have specified that the Kardashian-Jenners are the First Family of Hollywood? Maybe,” she wrote. “But I also don't think that because a magazine gives them that label, it discredits the Obamas or bumps them from the title. The country is well aware that the president's family will forever be officially known as America's First Family, and giving the Kardashian-Jenners a tongue-in-cheek label like that hardly dethrones the real First Family.” By Herb Scribner, Deseret News The Times-News By Herb Scribner, Deseret News Posted Oct. 6, 2015 at 11:30 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:43:24.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
