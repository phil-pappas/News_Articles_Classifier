Yes I have had three films this year â€“ 'Shamitabh', 'Piku' and 'Wazir'-- and they have been most rewarding for me purely because of its diverse content,\" Bachchan told PTI. \n\"I now have an addition to it in the shape of a TV show, 'Aaj Ki Raat Hai Zindagi'. Its tough coping with all this altogether, but I endeavour. If it works I feel blessed. \nIf it does not I shall have to work harder to overcome failure or disappointment,\" he said. With age generally people retire to pursue some hobbies and interests, but Bachchan has been the busiest since he turned 60. \n\"I am happy that I still get some work to do. I would wish for that to continue so long as my body can take it.\" \nThe legendary actor is excited about his new TV show but did not reveal much. \"We work with a certain zeal and promise on all our projects and we hope that it finds appreciation. The results are with the audience. Their verdict is prime and supreme. We value that and work towards it,\" he said. \n\"Life is filled with hardship and struggle and its vagaries, but life is beautiful too. One needs to celebrate that as well, and to celebrate those that make it possible for life to be beautiful,\" he said. \nIt was \"Kaun Banega Crorepati\" that resurrected the career of Bachchan and the megastar thinks television as a medium in recent times has evolved a lot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:57:43.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
