The backpacks will sell for $135 and the duffels for $150.\nProceeds from bag sales benefit Re:new, a nonprofit that provides employment opportunities for refugee women, and the Alto Mayo Forest Carbon Project in Peru, United said.\n\"United is committed to operating sustainably and responsibly, and that means finding creative ways to further reduce our impact on the environment,\" said Angela Foster-Rice, the airline's managing director of environmental affairs and sustainability.\nThe bags were designed by the Columbia College students to fit under airplane seats while being durable, wearable, economical and attractive, United said. United chose the winning designs, and Re:new produced the bags.\nFind out more about how the bags were made here .\nSouthwest Airlines has done something similar. Earlier this year, it began shipping duffels and totes made from the leather of old aircraft seats. Looptworks of Portland, Ore., helped the airline turn 43 acres of discarded leather from 80,000 seats into bags.\ngkarp@tribpub.com\nTwitter @spendingsmart\n Columbia College Chicago Business Southwest Airlines O'Hare International Airport", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fce41/turbine/ct-united-airlines-upcycle-bags-1016-biz-20151015", "https://youtu.be/hDg3vF32BYU"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:06:41.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
