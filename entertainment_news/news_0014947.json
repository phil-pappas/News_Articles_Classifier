On Friday's Good Morning America , Quaid, in his first interview since the ruling, described how he felt. \n\"Literally like, I've been snapped from the jaws of defeat,\" he said, still sporting a shaggy white beard. \nThe couple also shared what they want the public to know about their legal situation. \"We own our house,\" Evi declared. \n\"Yeah, that's the bottom line,\" Randy agreed. \"This is just a property dispute.\" \nThe two are considered by the state of California to be fugitives from the law after being accused of felony vandalism to a home they once owned. Still, the Quaids aren't out of the woods just yet. The Santa Barbara District Attorney's Office said in a statement they still have a warrant for the couple's arrest, adding if they should leave Vermont and enter another state, they should expect to be arrested again. \nNow that they've apparently won one battle, Quaid said he's ready to get back to work. \"I hope...you'll see me real soon out there on the big screen or the small screen or Netflix or wherever it may be,\" he said on GMA . \nThe Independence Day star also had a message for fans: \"I'd just like to thank everyone for all their nice thoughts and support.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:46:03.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
