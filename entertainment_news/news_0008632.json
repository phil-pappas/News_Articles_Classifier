Mason Noise (Syco/Thames TV) \nIn an official statement, The X Factor’s Nick Grimshaw explained his decision to bring Mason back, saying: “After Tom decided to leave the show, Mason was the person I wanted to bring back. \n“Yes he was difficult at the six chair challenge, but people with an artistic temperament can be difficult. He’s talented and in previous auditions excited us judges. Sometimes a challenge is interesting.” \nMason said: “I appreciate Nick inviting me back on the show. And even more so, I appreciate the fact he understands what I am trying to achieve… challenge accepted!” \nHe will join Nick at the judge’s houses stage along with the other boys in the category – Ben Clark, Che Chesterman, Josh Daniel, Seann Miley Moore and Simon Lynch. X Factor’s Tom Bleasby (Syco/Thames TV) \nTom explained his reasons for leaving the show on the official X Factor website at ITV.com. \n“It was a tough decision, I think I really discovered it at the six chair challenge,” he said. “I just don’t know if I felt vocally ready to take on the competition and the pressure.” Can I just set the record straight. @JessieJ did NOT tell me to leave the @TheXFactor . I made a conscious decision on what is right for me. \n— Tom Bleasby (@TomBleasby) October 14, 2015 \nHe added: “I’m quite a relatively new singer, back in March, I was singing in my bedroom, so I’ve never took to live performing very well. I’m still discovering myself and in the competition, there are some amazing singers and I feel like I need more time to get better myself, as I don’t feel like I’m strong enough.” Due to personal reasons I have decided to withdraw from The X Factor. Thank you to all the judges, especially Nick for his belief in me. \n— Tom Bleasby (@TomBleasby) October 12, 2015 Share article \nHe continued: “Moving forward, without being 100 per cent, would have been selfish on my part because I would have stopped someone else who was at 100 per cent vocally from going further in the competition. Hopefully given time, I could get there with more time to grow artistically and vocally.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:35:54.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
