It is gripping. It's chilling. It's nail-biting. And you'll never know what's going to happen, 'cause every turn is something different.\" \nRELATED: NJ's Tom Bury makes 'Restaurant Impossible' a reality \nIn the interview, Irvine reveals that Italian restaurants (like La Casa Bianca) are the most likely to fail, \"because, you know, their mom tells them they can make gravy or sauce, depending on where you come from, they're great with people, and they should open a restaurant. And for the first six months, it's great, because we invite all our friends. Then they realize the bills are mounting up.\" \nLa Casa Bianca's current menu is pretty standard red sauce Italian — baked stuffed clams, pasta fagioli, fried calamari, chicken cacciatore, rigatoni alla vodka — with fairly generous reviews on Yelp . The episode is tentatively scheduled to air Dec. 17. \nVicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com . Follow her on Twitter @vickihy . Find NJ.com/Entertainment on Facebook .
