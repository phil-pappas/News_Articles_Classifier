Singapore Four Languages Culture [photograph] Retrieved from Singapore Four Languages Culture Within the context of a discussion of the implications and nature of the linguistic turn within and for continental philosophy, Claire Colebrook defines it as\n\"the rejection of any approach to meaning, value, sense, or concepts that would lie beyond linguistic systems; premodern philosophical problems - the nature of God, freedom, or reality - could not be approached other than through the vocabularies we use to denote such terms. It would no longer be legitimate to establish the true meaning of essence of an identity, and then correct ordinary usage, for meaning and identity are established through linguistic usage...Turning to continental philosophy, there are three ways in which we might address the linguistic turn as it pertains to the continental tradition. The first is in relation to analytic philosophy and concerns the branching out into two traditions following the early-twentieth century attempt to ground philosophy on the purely formal sign systems of mathematics and logic. The second way of understanding the linguistic turn is as a response to phenomenology: from phenomenology's attention to the instituting and constitutive acts of consciousness, language-oriented philosophy regarded meaning and experience as only through, rather than before, language.\"\nIt is only with the advent of a post-linguistic era for philosophy, she goes on to argue, that we can intelligibly discuss what this linguistic turn constituted. To be sure, the linguistic turn was felt among both analytic and continental philosophers. Russell and Husserl both believed that it was possible and desirable to provide a foundation of certainty that would bring philosophy closer to the sciences. More specifically, they wanted to provide a foundation for the sciences such as mathematics. Language itself was eventually elevated to philosophical investigation.\nFor example, Husserl articulated a psychologistic approach to mathematical signs according to which equations refer to a consciousness which intuitively grasps such quantities. Thus, he rejected the Neoplatonistic idea that mathematical entities are objective, external entities. Such equations were ultimately, for Husserl, traceable back to the human mind, from which they have their origin. Frege, himself a Neoplatonist with respect to mathematics, criticized Husserl on this account. Frege believed that such equations were objectively true and mind-independent.\n\"...this would have implications for languages beyond those of the formal sciences. If we want to understand the meaning of a sentence such as \"Scott is the author of Waverley,\" then we need to give it logical form: first the positing of existence - there exists an obect that answers to the term \"Scott\" - and then the predication of at least one feature of that object - it authored Waverly. The messiness of everyday language could be broken up into the positing of existing objects, and then the attribution of what is true or false regarding those objects. For analytic philosophy after Frege, there was first the desire to trace everyday language back to some clear and distinct logical sense. Sentences that could not be broken down into such positings of truth and falsity did not have a proper sense. This led, eventually, away from the notion of tracing everything back to some ultimate logical foundation - the objects in the world and their predicates - and to, in its place, a linguistic foundation: what can and cannot be said in a language, and what linguistic formulations produce insoluble nonsensical or unverifiable problems?\"\nFor Richard Rorty, this turn to the linguistic suggested to philosophers that al philosophical disputes were really disputes over nothing but language. Traditional metaphysical questions therefore became disputes about language. Rather than disputing whether Cartesian dualism or Spinozist monism was correct, the philosopher would ask how the word \"substance\" was being used. The philosopher could then argue that it is more helpful to reject a distinction between the mental and the physical, or to simply do away with such terms altogether. It is by means of this linguistic turn that philosophers sought to overcome metaphysics.\nThe examination of pre-linguistic worlds or truths was no longer interesting. Instead, the function of language became the object of study, with the result that many spurious philosophical problems would be done away with. The effect this linguistic turn would have on both continental and analytic philosophy was tremendous thanks to the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. In his early work, Wittgenstein (so the official story goes) was interested in a positivist departure, according to which language could be grounded on \"ultimate, prelinguistic, and clearly intuitable truths.\" Wittgenstein rejected this \"picture\" view of epistemology and metaphysics in his later work, and would arguably succumb to linguistic idealism in his \"Philosophical Investigations.\" For the later Wittgenstein, A word's meaning does not refer to a pre- or extra-linguistic experienced. Instead, the term establishes meaning through its use. Meaning itself becomes use, not reference. \"If we want to understand what a term means, then we need to see how it functions in a specific language,\" as Claire Colebrook says, summarizing his later approach. Thus, rather than asking what a word means, philosophers, he believed, ought to look at how words function within the context of a discourse or worldview. The question is not \"what does this word refer to?\" but rather, \"what sort of worldview does this language function to produce?\"\nExamination of language therefore does not refer to entities; it constructs worldviews. Emphasis would be laid upon this among continental philosophers in particular. For example, Lyotard would go on to argue that there are discourses which establish worldviews which are fundamentally incommensurable with one another. It is in this way that the later Wittgenstein's philosophy contributed to the rejection of metaphysical speculation or scientism, and towards the study of language as tools for establishing, and contributing to the longevity of, or destruction of, discourses or worldviews. Habermas would go on to emphasize this function of language, emphasizing that speech, action and language are all inherently communal. As Clairebrook says, summarizing Habermas' philosophical and ethical approach to communal discourse, \"...we are always placed in a context of communication. Such contexts suppose an ideal of agreement, for it would make no sense (or be a performative contradiction) to speak or act with others without the aiming for consensus or agreement.\"", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl", "http://www.academia.edu/1186021/Linguistic_Turn"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:40:03.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
