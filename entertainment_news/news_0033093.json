Whether it’s a starting pitcher who doesn’t put his team in a position to win, a relief pitcher who can’t make an appearance without blowing a lead or a position player sputtering at the dish and/or showing off a brick glove in the field, a lot can go wrong. \nSo with that in mind, PointAfter set out to find the least valuable player on each MLB team from the 2015 season. The idea was to pin down players who, while playing or pitching regularly, hurt their team’s chances more than they helped. We ranked players by their 2015 WAR (wins above replacement), from bad to worse. #30. New York Mets: Jenrry Mejia \n2015 WAR: 0.5 \nWe could easily peg John Mayberry Jr. and his .164/.227/.318 slash line here, but another player was arguably less valuable for decisions he made to jeopardize the team. \nJenrry Mejia, one of the game’s most talented relief pitchers, was suspended in July by MLB for 162 games after testing positive for performance-enhancing substances for the second time in his career. Mejia’s poor judgment ensured that the Mets bullpen would be shorthanded throughout the campaign, and while that didn’t keep the team out of the playoffs, Mejia put the Mets in a tough spot. #29. Houston Astros: Chris Carter \n2015 WAR: -0.1 \nSimilar to free-swingers like Mark Reynolds, Chris Carter has gained a reputation as an all-or-nothing hitter. \nThat label has never been more apt than it was in 2015. The 28-year-old first baseman smacked 24 homers, but he also struck out an eye-popping 151 times in 391 at-bats (his batting average finished at a paltry .199). He cut down his strikeout rate to avoid another 200-whiff season, but it would still be nice to see Carter become more of a complete hitter who can get on base more often. #28. Los Angeles Dodgers: Jim Johnson \n2015 WAR: -0.1 \nThe 2015 campaign was a tale of two cities for relief pitcher Jim Johnson. As a member of the Braves prior to his involvement in a three-team, 13-player trade that sent him to Hollywood, the 6’6″ right-hander collected nine saves and 20 holds to accompany a solid 2.25 ERA. In 23 appearances for the Dodgers, Johnson’s ERA checked in at 10.13. \nHe allowed 21 earned runs in just 18.2 innings and had a WAR of -1.6 in a Dodgers jersey. #27. Pittsburgh Pirates: Andrew Lambo \n2015 WAR: -0.5 \nPedro Alvarez made a bit of case to be included here for his sieve-like glove work. The first baseman posted a Hanley Ramirez-esque -2.3 dWAR at what many believe to be the game’s easiest defensive position, and he committed more than twice as many errors (23) as the next-worst qualified 1B (Jose Abreu, with 11). \nOffensive production (27 homers and 77 RBI) saved him, so who was least valuable for a Pirates team that made the NL wild-card round? Frankly, there aren’t any standouts among players who received significant play time, so we opted to go with right fielder Andrew Lambo. He played just 20 games for the Buccos and had one hit in 25 at-bats for a .040/.111/.080 slash line. #26. St. Louis Cardinals: Pete Kozma \n2015 WAR: -0.7 \nYou’d think a team that won a league-best 100 games during the regular season wouldn’t have a weak link, but even the mighty Cardinals were not free from underperforming pieces to the puzzle. \nPete Kozma, who played 76 games for the Cards, finished the year hitting .152/.236/.152. Oddly, that’s not the most depressing stat about Kozma’s campaign. In his 99 at-bats, Kozma only recorded two RBI. #25. Seattle Mariners: Mike Zunino \n2015 WAR: -0.7 \nMike Zunino is a solid defensive catcher. Some pundits might even argue he’s one of the best in the game behind the dish. Unfortunately, he often looks hopeless in the batter’s box. \nThe 24-year-old struck out 132 times in 350 at-bats, and his slash line of .174/.230/.300 looks made up. His awful offensive numbers got him demoted in August. And honestly, he probably should have been sent to the minors before then. #24. Chicago White Sox: Adam LaRoche \n2015 WAR: -0.8 \nAdam LaRoche won both a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award back in 2012 as a member of the Washington Nationals, but his first year with the White Sox ensured he wouldn’t even be in the ballpark of repeating that success. \nThe lefty only started 44 games at first base. In that time, he collected a -1.1 dWAR. LaRoche spent most of his time on the diamond focusing on hitting as the team’s DH, but an ugly .207/.293/.340 slash line certainly isn’t what Chicago paid for when signing the southpaw to a two-year, $25 million deal last winter. #23. Arizona Diamondbacks: Chris Owings \n2015 WAR: -0.8 \nMiddle infielder Chris Owings “earns” the infamous moniker of least valuable player from the D-Backs 2015 campaign. In 147 games (115 of those at second base), Owings collected a team-worst -0.9 offensive wins above replacement. His meager slash line of .227/.264/.322 was downright ugly. His defense was solid, but it didn’t help mitigate those awful stats in the batter’s box. #22. Chicago Cubs: James Russell \n2015 WAR: -0.9 \nYoung Dominican shortstop Starlin Castro really struggled for Chicago before the All-Star break with a slash line of .247/.283/.321, but he played much better in the second half and improved his WAR from negative to positive. \nThe turnaround was a welcome one for the Cubs, and it removed him from contention as the team’s least-valuable body on the roster. Instead, that distinction goes to relief pitcher James Russell, who managed to collect a team-worst -0.9 WAR in just 49 relief appearances. \nThe former Texas Longhorn surrendered 24 runs (20 earned) in just 34 innings of work. This was a far cry from the 2.97 ERA he posted in 2014 between the Cubs and Braves in 66 total appearances. #21. Oakland Athletics: Dan Otero \n2015 WAR: -1.0 \nBoth freshly signed DH Billy Butler and the injury-ravaged Coco Crisp had lackluster years as hitters for Oakland, but Dan Otero posted the worst WAR on the team (no small feat for a relief pitcher). \nIn his 41 relief appearances, Otero surrendered 35 earned runs for an ERA of 6.75. He was one of the Athletics’ best bullpen arms in 2013 and 2014 after coming over from the San Francisco Giants, but he just wasn’t able to repeat those performances in 2015. #20. Los Angeles Angels: Matt Joyce \n2015 WAR: -1.0 \nMatt Joyce carved a niche with the Tampa Bay Rays as a reliable hitter who could get on base and hit home runs, but his move to the opposite coast was met with disaster. \nThrough 93 games played, Joyce posted a meager .174/.272/.291 slash line. He also started 58 games in left field, where he accumulated a dWAR of -0.7. Joyce’s negative impact forced the Halos to trade for outfielders Shane Victorino, David Murphy and David DeJesus, but that wasn’t enough to get L.A. to the postseason. #19. Kansas City Royals: Alex Rios \n2015 WAR: -1.1 \nAlex Rios missed a large chunk of time from early April to late May with a hand injury. Upon his return, the veteran outfielder posted a slash line of .189/.219/.211 in June — truly inexcusable numbers for a seasoned pro. \nRios showed signs of turning things around with a .316 average and .350 OBP for July heading into All-Star festivities, but a -1.0 dWAR in the outfield showed that the 34-year-old hurt the Royals in other ways as well. Kansas City has been more than good enough to cover those flaws, though, so ultimately it’s not a huge deal. #18. New York Yankees: Chris Capuano \n2015 WAR: -1.1 \nChris Capuano has carved a nice niche in the Majors as a spot starter and long reliever, but at 37 years old he wasn’t able to fool many hitters for the Yanks. \nIn 22 appearances for New York (four starts), the southpaw surrendered 38 runs (36 of them earned). His 7.97 ERA and -1.1 WAR were both the worst on the team. #17. Miami Marlins: Ichiro Suzuki \n2015 WAR: -1.2 \nIt pains us to say it, because Ichiro Suzuki is a living legend and one of the best baseball players to ever lace up the cleats, but Father Time claims everyone’s career in the end. \nThe 41-year-old Japanese outfielder has a lifetime on-base percentage of .356, but his OBP in 2015 was a lackluster (and uncharacteristic) .282. \nHe’s a 10-time Gold Glove award winner, but the advanced stats haven’t been kind to him on the defensive side either. \nIt will be a sad day when Ichiro eventually decides to call it quits, and that moment appears to be creeping up rather quickly. #16. Colorado Rockies: Kyle Parker \n2015 WAR: -1.2 \nWith an on-base percentage of just .223, Kyle Parker had an OBP worse than the batting average of 140 qualified position players. \nHe hit all three of his home runs and collected 10 of his 11 RBI in hitter-friendly Coors Field, but he really struggled to hit on the road and was just a net negative for the Rockies when he was in the lineup. #15. Cleveland Indians: Nick Swisher \n2015 WAR: -1.2 \nFirst baseman Carlos Santana and his unsightly -1.4 dWAR might have put him in the conversation here if not for his solid offensive output: 19 homers, 85 RBI and 11 (!!) stolen bases. \nInstead, the least valuable player on the Indians this season was Nick Swisher. The 34-year-old switch hitter only played in 30 games due to injury (all but one at DH). He hit .198/.261/.297 in an Indians uniform before being traded to Atlanta. #14. San Diego Padres: Odrisamer Despaigne \n2015 WAR: -1.3 \nOn the defensive side of things, splashy offseason acquisition Matt Kemp was one of the worst in baseball in 2015. The 30-year-old former MVP candidate finished the season with -2.4 dWAR — which was the second-worst mark in MLB behind Hanley Ramirez and Chris Colabello. \nLike Pedro Alvarez in Pittsburgh, however, Kemp’s offense was enough to negate that weakness. So instead, Odrisamer Despaigne is the goat. After posting a 3.36 ERA in 16 starts last year, the Cuban’s ERA spiked to 5.80 in 34 games (18 starts) in 2015. His WAR stat was the worst on the Padres. #13. Cincinnati Reds: Brennan Boesch \n2015 WAR: -1.3 \nBack in 2011, Brennan Boesch hit .283/.341/.458 for the Detroit Tigers with 16 homers, 25 doubles and 75 runs scored. He was a genuine asset as a corner outfielder who hit for average while also popping some dingers. \nFast-forward to 2015 and it’s hard to believe Boesch used to be such an integral cog. In 51 games played for Cincy, the 30-year-old hit .146/.191/.202. Reds minor leaguers must be wondering why they weren’t given Boesch’s play time when looking at those horrific numbers. #12. Atlanta Braves: Mike Foltynewicz \n2015 WAR: -1.4 \nFoltynewicz started 15 games for the hapless Braves in 2015, finishing with a 4-6 record and a 5.71 ERA. The 24-year-old was hit hard consistently throughout the campaign, as he gave up 17 home runs in just 86.2 innings pitched. All told, his -1.4 WAR was the worst on the team by a wide margin. \nHis fastball velocity averages more than 94 miles per hour and he’s still young, but early returns on the 6’4″ starter have not been great. Perhaps a move to the bullpen is the next step to revitalize his career. #11. Philadelphia Phillies: Ryan Howard \n2015 WAR: -1.4 \nFrom 2006-2011, Ryan Howard was one of baseball’s best sluggers. He smacked 262 home runs over that span for an average of more than 43 bombs per calendar year (he capped out in 2006 with 58 big flies). \nSince then, though, Howard’s power, on-base percentage and batting average have all plummeted. He bottomed out in 2015 with -1.4 WAR and a career-worst .277 OBP. \nOn defense, Howard hasn’t recorded positive dWAR since 2005, but that doesn’t make his -1.8 dWAR this season any less egregious. He did hit 23 homers, but that wasn’t much of a consolation prize when accounting for the full package. #10. Washington Nationals: Jayson Werth \n2015 WAR: -1.6 \nWith a total 2015 salary of $21,571,428, Jayson Werth was the highest-paid Nationals player. He fell grossly short of playing up to his pay grade. \nHis -0.4 oWAR were third-worst on the roster. His -1.7 dWAR, meanwhile, were the worst on the team. In other words, he was a net negative out on the diamond and in the batter’s box. He hit .221/.302/.384 with 12 homers and 32 RBI. Those numbers would be borderline acceptable for a cheap role player, but Werth is one of the highest-paid players in the sport. As such, he needs to live up to a much higher standard. #9. Toronto Blue Jays: Drew Hutchison \n2015 WAR: -1.7 \nIt’s worth noting outfielder Chris Colabello’s alarmingly ghastly -2.5 dWAR here, but hitting .321 with 15 homers and 54 RBI can definitely help mask those heinous numbers. \nInstead, Drew Hutchison and his 5.57 ERA get the dubious nod here. Hutchison’s 13-5 record is actually quite good, but it makes sense provided that he received 6.64 runs of support per start. That would have led MLB by a wide margin if Hutchison qualified for the leaderboard. Credit the offense for picking up the man on the mound, but Hutchison shouldn’t require that type of offensive output to win games. #8. Texas Rangers: Ross Detwiler \n2015 WAR: -1.7 \nIn a season he split between the Braves and Rangers, Ross Detwiler really sputtered on the mound. In 17 games (seven starts) for Texas, the 29-year-old went 0-5 with -1.1 WAR and a 7.12 ERA. \nHe went 10-8 with a 3.40 ERA in 27 starts for the Nationals in 2012, so he has shown the ability to complete against major league hitters. That ability simply didn’t show up in 2015. #7. Detroit Tigers: Shane Greene \n2015 WAR: -1.8 \nShane Greene’s name was left floundering at the bottom of the list of pitchers by WAR along with Bud Norris. The 26-year-old right-hander, who was traded to Detroit from the Yankees in a three-team deal in December, was comparably ineffective. \nGreene actually started the season on an absolute tear. He pitched 23 innings combined in his first three starts and allowed just one earned run. With a 3-0 record and 0.39 ERA, it appeared as if the Tigers poached a potential ace away from N.Y. He came crashing back down to earth in his next two starts, though, surrendering 15 earned runs over 8.1 innings pitched. He lost his mojo and finished the year with a 6.88 ERA and -1.8 WAR. #6. Baltimore Orioles: Bud Norris \n2015 WAR: -1.8 \nThere’s genuinely no contest for the Baltimore Orioles ‘ goat of 2015. Starting pitcher Bud Norris , who compiled a 15-8 record with a 3.65 ERA last season, completely fell apart. \nIn just 18 appearances for Baltimore, Norris went 2-9 with a whopping 7.06 ERA. His WAR of -1.8 for the season tied for last place out of 735 MLB pitchers. He was DFA’d by Baltimore and then picked up by the Padres, but he didn’t pitch much better in San Diego. #5. San Francisco Giants: Angel Pagan \n2015 WAR: -1.9 \nOutfield speedster Angel Pagan has had an impossible time staying healthy in recent years. But with his health intact through much of 2015, he wasn’t able to move the needle much. \nIn addition to his .303 OBP being a career low, it’s also significantly worse than his career average of .330. Throw in a dWAR of -1.9 in center field and it’s easy to surmise that the 34-year-old is starting an inevitable decline. #4. Tampa Bay Rays: Rene Rivera \n2015 WAR: -2.0 \nRene Rivera actually showed promise last season by hitting .252 with 11 homers and 44 RBI for the San Diego Padres. In moving to the opposite coast, it appeared the 32-year-old catcher left his talent in California. \nIn 2015 (110 games), Rivera posted an ugly .178/.213/.275 slash line, which is reflected by his glacial strike zone heat map. #3. Minnesota Twins: Danny Santana \n2015 WAR: -2.2 \nThe Minnesota Twins had a lot of players struggle in the batter’s box throughout 2015. Heck, even Brian Dozier (Minny’s All-Star second baseman) hit just .236 with a .307 OBP. \nDanny Santana, meanwhile, who burst onto the MLB scene as a rookie last season by hitting .319/.353/.472 with 20 stolen bases and 3.9 WAR through 101 games played, experienced a sophomore slump. Actually, “sophomore slump” doesn’t even cut it. He came crashing back down to earth like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. \nThe 24-year-old (rightfully) entered 2015 as the starting shortstop, but it appeared the MonStars stole all of his talent. His WAR of -2.2 was the worst in baseball out of more than 1,300 position players. He hit .215 and drew a shockingly low six walks in 261 at-bats. #2. Boston Red Sox: Pablo Sandoval/Hanley Ramirez \n2015 WAR (Sandoval): -0.9 2015 WAR (Ramirez): -1.3 \nThe last-place Red Sox had a handful of candidates vying for least-valuable status throughout the season, but ultimately it comes down to the two “prize” free-agent signings: Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez. \nRamirez’s shockingly awful defensive acumen in left field dragged him down considerably. With a -2.5 dWAR, the Dominican former shortstop was the worst left fielder in the Majors (tied with Chris Colabello of Toronto). His offense started out hot and essentially negated the porous defense — he hit 10 homers in April alone — but he hit just nine additional round-trippers after the season’s first month. \nThe “Kung Fu Panda,” meanwhile, posted a career-worst slash line of .245/.292/.366. He also battled staying in shape and at one point had to leave a game due to dehydration . Long story short, both Ramirez and Sandoval were net negatives for the Red Sox. For the checks they’re cashing, Boston expected much, much more. #1. Milwaukee Brewers: Matt Garza and Kyle Lohse \n2015 WAR (Garza): -1.7 2015 WAR (Lohse): -1.3 \nIf you’re curious why the Brewers finished 2015 a whopping 32 games behind the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals, taking a look at the starting pitching is a good place to start. Specifically, the alarming hard times that have befallen Kyle Lohse and Matt Garza. \nOnce two of the game’s most consistent pitchers, each guy had an ERA over 5.00 and 10 losses at the halfway point. Frankly, they were not fooling any opposing hitters on the mound. But with a combined salary of more than $23 million, the Brew Crew had little choice but to stick with its sputtering starters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:11:04.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
