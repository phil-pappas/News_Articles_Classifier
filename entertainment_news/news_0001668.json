I thought he was too handsome. I forwarded his picture to my creative team and told them to call him for an audition,\" Ekta said.\n\"He did an audition in Chandigarh and forwarded it to me. Karan wasn't a good actor,\" she added.\nBut his ability to spread positivity around him made her finalise him for 'Kitani Mohabbat Hai' in 2009.\nAnd now, Ekta, who produces another show 'Kumkum Bhagya' that has a character Abhi - a rock star - has now cast Karan in 'Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum'.\n\"There's always a dearth of rock stars in this country. Actually to be a rock star is a big aspiration in the youth of our country. I've done quite a few shows on rock stars and the response has been amazingly good,\" Ekta said.\n\"This show is about music, romance... that is created on different ideology of music,\" she said.\nIt will air from October 26 on &TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:58:50.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
