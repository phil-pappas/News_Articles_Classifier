Related Stories Tybee Island mulling public booze restrictions Task force to suggest Tybee Island limits public drinking By Dash Coleman A public safety task force has formally recommended to Tybee Island’s mayor that public consumption of alcohol should be restricted.\n“It is recommended that the City Council enact an ordinance, with provisions, that consumption of alcoholic beverages, beer or wine would be prohibited in specific public places as a means to regulate crowd control, traffic control, and enhance overall public safety island wide,” task force chairman Demery Bishop wrote to Mayor Jason Buelterman on Tuesday.\nThe group, appointed in the wake of a shooting at this year’s Orange Crush party, was tasked by Buelterman with coming up with recommendations for crowd control and general safety enhancements.\nStatistics obtained from the Tybee Island Police Department showed nearly 75 percent of arrests in the city from Jan. 1 to July 31 were alcohol related. Booze was also a major factor in arrest totals for the two previous years as well as citations.\nLast month, the group heard from Beaufort County, S.C., Sheriff P.J. Tanner, whose jurisdiction includes Hilton Head Island, where public consumption of alcohol has been banned since the early 1990s.\nIn general, the recommendation is being made with the idea that limiting public alcohol consumption will reduce arrests and make the island less of a party destination. Tybee is currently one of the only beaches in the region where open drinking is legal.\nBishop said the idea would be “a true cultural change for our beach community.”\nThere’s a decent bit of backlash to the idea since drinking on the beach at Tybee is more or less ingrained in the culture.\nThe mayor is passing the letter on to City Council’s public safety committee.\nChairwoman Wanda Doyle said the committee will review the recommendations during its Oct. 22 meeting at the police department.\nShe expects the meeting to be long, and she said she and others will be talking to residents and getting feedback beforehand.\nThe public safety committee will present its own recommendations — if there are any — to full City Council by the end of the year, Doyle said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14719584_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14719584_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:59:04.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
