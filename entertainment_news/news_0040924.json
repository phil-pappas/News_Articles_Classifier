Smith announced today the anticipated release of her debut fiction novel, \"The Urban Boys: Discovery of the Five Senses\" (ISBN-9780989474757, 292 pages, $12.95). Established in the Young Adult and Adult Action-Adventure categories alike, \"The Urban Boys\" is an action-adventure story about five teen boys who are mysteriously exposed to a foreign energy source that gives them extremely heightened senses. Sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell become hypersensitive gifts that forever change the world. The story chronicles their effortless interrelations and later exposes the testing of their deep bonds, and introduces the reader to an array of supporting characters who alter the boys’ lives forever.\nAn established non-fiction writer, Smith chose the teen fiction genre as a way to enhance her daughters’ (then) high school literary experience, and to engage other youth in literacy development. \"The Urban Boys\" offers young and mature readers central themes of loyalty, responsibility, honesty, fear, and triumph, which become artfully integrated with cinematic-level action and high drama. The story twists, turns, and grinds through elements of science-fiction and action-adventure in a diverse, exciting, edge-of-your-seat narrative.\nOverview: The story’s small town of Danville Heights, a carefully crafted universe, contrasts with the dark, gloomy town of Sandry Lake where evil abounds. Upon the boys’ mysterious incident with the energy source, they’re instinctively called to Sandry Lake to root out evil, and their senses guide them each time. However, secrecy about their mission, furious battles with evil thugs, extreme fatigue, and stress and pressure soon overwhelm the boys, but they must find a way to embrace their fate. A lurking, Dark Stranger seems to know their plight, and a strikingly beautiful yet fearless girl lends way to heightened confusion. Shocking details about these two characters, and Druth, the evil antagonist, twist and grind the story even further.\nK.N. Smith is also an ardent supporter of youth and family literacy programs across the globe. \"My hope is that 'The Urban Boys' will spark imagination in a wide variety of readers while elevating global literacy efforts. It’s important that we have diverse families of readers for generations to come,\" said Smith.\nAvailable in softcover, Kindle e-book format, and all other e-book formats, \"The Urban Boys: Discovery of the Five Senses\" is the first in a series with the second book due in spring 2016. Now available at Amazon.com, BN.com, the Apple iBookstore, major book retailers, and independent book stores.
