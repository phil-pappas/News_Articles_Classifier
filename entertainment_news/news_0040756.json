Dâ€™Angelo and the Vanguard, Public Enemy, Santigold, the Zoe Kravitz-led Lolawolf and Tyler, the Creator were supposed to be headlining for Afropunkâ€™s debut in Atlanta, but Dâ€™Angelo pulled out for health reasons and the event was later canceled due to impending bad weather.

The two-day festival was supposed to kick off Saturday at Central Park. \nBut organizers canceled the festival, saying Thursday that the forecast of heavy rainfall this weekend and constant rain beforehand would have presented too much of a challenge and was a safety concern. \nSome volunteer projects included promoting more bicycle use in Atlanta, uplifting women's voices in Georgia politics and supporting the LGBT movement. There was also an initiative to plant trees, and improve green space in parks and community gardens. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:51:02.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
