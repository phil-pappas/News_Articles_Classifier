I wonder how he manages.’” By this point in Roger Graef’s charming and eye-opening documentary, the audience could share the joke, because it was already abundantly clear how Brett himself manages: born without arms because his mother used a single Thalidomide tablet during her pregnancy, he has made a successful life for himself in Australia as a DJ, record producer, bulldozer operator, musician and general entrepreneur. \nWatching him play the piano with his feet – not to mention roll and smoke cigarettes, make cups of tea and drive a sports car – it was tempting to agree with his 20-year-old daughter’s observation that “you’re only disabled when it means parking at the front of Woolworths.” \nBrett Nielsen with his daughter Pasha (Photo: BBC/Films of Record/Michael Angus) \nRoger Graef first filmed Brett 50 years ago, in a documentary aimed at persuading schoolteachers that children born with physical defects from Thalidomide should not be written off intellectually as well. Their reunion was fascinating, but equally enthralling to watch was the reaction of Brett’s children as their father opened up about his early life, pulling out sheaves of photos of himself belting out House of the Rising Sun in a sharp suit and accompanying himself on the keyboard with his toes. \nFilm-maker Roger Graef, right, first met Brett when he was four years old (Photo: BBC/Films of Record/Michael Angus) \nThe film expressed sincere admiration of and interest in Brett without descending into hagiography: from the grim-faced testimony of two adult brothers to Brett’s own evasive account of three failed marriages, some elements suggested his life was just as vulnerable to complexity and discord as anyone else’s. In Graef’s own words, the documentary offered a portrait of “an extraordinary ordinary man”. Like everything else here, that comment had the ring of truth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:11:08.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
