Rather than running the risk of releasing a single and having it fall flat, Smith re-entered the music game with a featured verse on a hot little groove that's already been nominated for record of the year at the Latin Grammys. It calls back to his \"Men in Black\" heyday and subtly reminds us that Smith was that actor we used to love, even if his verses were corny. This is Smith saying, \"Hey, remember when Eva Mendes was in the 'Miami' video? Remember 'Hitch'? Remember the warm feeling you used to get when you heard my voice and saw me on a big screen?\" \nSmith's cautious. Earlier this year, when he was promoting \"Focus,\" he told Ryan Seacrest that he'd spent some time in the studio with Kanye West and the rapper/producer was trying to get him \"gassed up.\" At the time, he was still non-committal about whether he was releasing new music. But judging from his Beats 1 interview this week, Smith seems pretty committed. He's acknowleging his previous career missteps with a full-on charm assault. \nSaid Smith: \"'After Earth' was really the first time I had a massive public, uhh ...\" \n\"Execution?\" Lowe supplied. \n\"A thoroughly and completely accepted failure,\" he finished. \nSo what's the point of all of this? \nWell, the big push at the center of everything is for \"Concussion,\" the new movie that comes out on Christmas. Smith stars as Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian neuropathologist who alerted a negligent NFL to its concussion problem by discovering and informing it of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The NFL famously tried to silence and discredit Omalu's claims, and the story was covered in the Frontline documentary \"League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis.\" \nA December release with a star like Smith taking on a topic this serious suggests that both he and the studio are eyeing an awards season push. Having an audience that's thrilled to see you and root for you because they're reminded of the 1990s Will Smith they knew and loved is an enormous asset, especially when Smith is facing early criticism of his Nigerian accent. Smith is smartly addressing his foibles now - the better to win you over when he starts campaigning for \"Concussion\" in earnest. \nMichael Fassbender is the favorite to win the best actor Oscar for \"Steve Jobs\" right now, according to Gold Derby. But Smith's name is in the discussion. And that alone is worth something.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:42:28.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
