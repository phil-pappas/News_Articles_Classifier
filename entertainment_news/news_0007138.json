She said there were times when she couldn't keep food or drink down at all.\n\"It was to that point that I was so desperate just to feel better already,\" Barajas told CBS News.\nMorning sickness is a common symptom of pregnancy that affects about half of all expectant mothers. Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) offered updated recommendations to combat the condition. It says studies have shown that taking a combination of vitamin B6 and the antihistamine doxylamine is effective for symptoms like vomiting or nausea -- and safe for women and their unborn babies.\n\"There's been a lot of women who've used it and they've got good data to show that there's no risk to the fetus,\" the group's Dr. Laura Sirott told CBS News.\nThe drugs are sold separately over the counter, or combined in a prescription pill.\nACOG also looked at another morning sickness drug, ondansetron, or Zofran, but decided there is not enough data yet on the drug's effects on fetal safety to issue a recommendation. The group is urging further studies of the drug.\nSirott said that patients should also consider natural alternatives -- like ginger or acupuncture -- for treating morning sickness. \"If that doesn't work, then they should know that there's something down the line that's a little stronger,\" she added.\nTaking prenatal vitamins three months prior to conception may also help curb morning sickness, ACOG said.\nBarajas has been feeling better since trying the recommended drug combination.\n\"By the third day, I was able to sleep again,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:50:56.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
