They connect a TV to an external signal source and transform the transmitted signal into video content, which is then displayed on the screen. STBs can convert both analog and digital signals into visuals. There are four main types of STBs: cable, satellite, IPTV, and hybrid. STBs can be used to improve picture quality and store videos. The digital format provides better sound and picture quality, as well as an enhanced viewing experience in HD. They also include interactive services, such as video on demand, and the freedom to pay only for selected channels.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the shipment volume of the global set-top box market to decline at a CAGR of (1.34) % over the period 2014-2019.
