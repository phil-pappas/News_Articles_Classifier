It offers the power and efficiency normally found in antennas up to 10 times the size of the C2V. The advanced technology behind the ClearStream Tapered Loop allows the C2V to be smaller and more powerful across today's DTV spectrum. The C2V has a 50+ mile range and can be used indoor or outdoor.\nAbout Antennas Direct\nAntennas Direct is the leader in antenna technology, reinventing the antenna for the digital era. With a heritage in over-the-air antennas specifically tuned for core DTV frequencies, Antennas Direct has invested major resources into the discovery and implementation of new antenna designs for digital reception.
