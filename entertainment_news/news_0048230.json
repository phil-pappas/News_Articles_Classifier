Starting with the Hong Kong flicks from decades past, to the resurgence of Asian films in the early 2000s, Asian movies have consistently entertained Filipino audiences. \nIn recent years, Korea has been a great source of joy for many– ranging from the famous K-Pop groups, fan-favorite Koreanovelas, and of course, hit Korean movies featuring the hottest and most sought-after stars of South Korea. \nTo celebrate our love of Korean stories, SKY offers unlimited viewing of two blockbuster Korean movies on SKY Pay-Per-View until Oct. 14. These films are dubbed in Tagalog, ensuring the most enjoyment for Filipinos nationwide. \nFirst-up is Gangnam Blues, a neo-noir action film set in 1970s Gangnam. Starring Lee Min-Ho, Kim Rae-Won, Kim Seolhyun, and Kim Ji-Soo, the story centers on the lives of Jong-Dae and Yong-Ki. Growing-up in poverty, their lives took a turn for the worse when local thugs destroyed their dwellings in a shantytown,. Everything went into a downward spiral from that point, accidentally separating these childhood friends after violent skirmishes between rival political groups. The heart of the film focuses on how these two friends walked two very different paths, on how Jong-Dae took the road of honest living, while Yong-Ki fell into more difficult times, becoming a gangster in the Myeongdong-pa, Seoul’s most powerful criminal organization. \nMourning Grave is the perfect complement to Gangnam Blue’s hard-hitting drama and action. A terrifying thriller starring Hye-Lin Han, Haneul Kang, and So-Eun Kim, the film follows the life of In-Su, a high school student harassed and bullied by his classmates because of his ability to see ghosts. In his pursuit of a life free from bullying, he moved back to his hometown to live with his uncle. But In-Su could not escape the patterns of his past, nor his abilities, when he met a ghost in the form of a beautiful girl. And like in his previous high school, he continues to be taunted by town bullies. In a cruel twist in his favor, all his new bullies were attacked by a vengeful ghost wearing a bloody mask – a ghost he suspects to be the beautiful girl, albeit in a more imposing form. The story is revealed in true horror flick fashion, in blood, mystery, and gore. \nDon’t miss these gems of Korean cinema.
