I purchased this lovely home from an elderly couple. It needs a lot of updating, starting with this bathroom! I don't know much about decorating as I am new to all of this, and wouldn't even know where to start!\nThis room is right off my living room and not too nice to look at! I would love to win this makeover to update at least one room of my house and make it feel like my own! I have more pictures if you'd like. It is a fairly small bathroom. Thank you for considering me.\nDesign by Bath Planet • Budget: $6,000-$8,000\nWe would replace the bathtub with a new one, cover the blue tiles with our acrylic wall system in one of the marble or granite looks for an updated appearance. We would retile the floor with a light color ceramic tile, replace the vanity with a light wood vanity instead of white and put new faucets and fixtures throughout.\nWe would replace the medicine cabinet with one that matches the new vanity and finish by removing the wallpaper and painting the bath.\n• Replacement bathtub: White acryclic with a nice luster. Replacement chrome fixtures within the bathtub area.\n• Acrylic wall system used to cover outdated tile, creating a very modern look, low maintenance. It's available in a wide variety of colors.\n• New vanity and medicine cabinet with new faucet fixtures. The cabinet would be modern-looking in a light wood finish with ample storage space. The faucet fixture would be a chrom arc -- very sleek.\n• New ceramic tile floor: Larger tiles, a 12-by-12 size, which is great and makes a small bathroom appear larger.\nRelated Article\nUpdated doors set the stage; smart lighting makes it shine Life & Entertainment Real Estate Room for Living Decor Home Improvement", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-18T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:35:00.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
