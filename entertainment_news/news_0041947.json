It should never be taken lightly as the red tape, licensing and potential pitfalls can be enough to stop any brewer before the first beer is even poured.\nDespite the challenges, more people than ever are giving it a try. We often hear about the ones that make it and the ones that don’t, what about the ones that are still fighting to get the door open? Recently, the social media work of Bone Up Brewery caught the eye of Rob Day and I.\nUpon investigating, we discovered that Bone Up is a “soon to open” brewery in Everett that has been walking the path from idea to grand opening for nearly a year and a half. Their blog offers a unique behind-the-scenes look at every triumph and delay on the path to opening a brewery - from designing logos and making chairs to zoning meetings and paperwork.\nWe reached out to the people behind Bone Up, Liz better known as Jimbo (don’t ask, it’s a secret) and Jared Kiraly, and discussed the challenges of opening a brewery, what they like best about beer, how they design their logos and much more.\nWho's behind Bone Up, where did you all come from, and what is everyone doing at the brewery?\nBone Up consists of Liz (Jimbo) and Jared Kiraly, a brewing duo with a furious passion for fermentation and heavy metal. We met while tending bar at the same place here in Boston and started working seriously on the concept of Bone Up almost two years ago. While we’re currently the only official members of the company, we'd certainly be remiss if we didn't at least mention the huge amount of support we've gotten from family and friends; we couldn’t have done this without them.\nAs for who does what, it's a pretty loose division of labor. Liz has a better eye for what looks good and what doesn't, so she takes the lead on the taproom and the website. Jared's been brewing for longer, so a fair amount of the technical nuts-and-bolts stuff in the brewhouse falls to him. But really, we both do some of everything - brewing, sales, bartending, keg washing, accounting (just kidding, Jared will do all the accounting), and everything in between.\nSocial media and copy has great tone. Who owns that?\nWhoever’s closer to the computer (seriously).\nWe've had a fair number of people ask which one of us wrote/writes all the stuff on the site, but it's split pretty evenly between the two of us. We tend to think of the company as an extension of who we are as people, and that shows through pretty well in our copy/branding/marketing/whathaveyou.\nBeen working on this since December. Biggest surprises? Hardest parts?\nWe've been working on it since well before December, actually - we spent much of 2014 writing the business plan and looking at real estate and negotiating our lease and all that fun stuff. Now here we are, a year and a half later, finally starting to get close(ish) to launching.\nBut biggest surprise so far has been how supportive everyone is and how much they want to get behind it! We get a lot of people asking us out of the blue if there’s any way they can help us out. It’s pretty flattering: even with 4,000 plus breweries in the country, people friggin’ love their beer and are thirsty for it; they want more local options and places to go.\nAs far as challenges go, the permitting process was trickier than we’d expected. The federal and state governments move slower than we’d like them to, and with every permit we apply for we find out that there’s three other previously unknown permits that we need in order for the first permit to hold any water. It’s like trying to slay a hydra!\nWho's doing the art?\nThat's all Jimbo! Keeping the art in-house strengthens our desire to have our personalities show through in our brand. Well, we've bought and/or commissioned a couple pieces to hang in the taproom, but the rest of it is done by us.\nWhy must Kelly shut up?\nIf you knew her, you wouldn't have to ask that question.\nWhat are you most excited about in the opening?\nMaking beer! Is that too obvious of an answer? We got into this whole mess because we love brewing and sharing our creations with the world, so what else is there?\nThe other big focus will be making the taproom a comfortable and fun place to go for the day. It’s pretty small (you can only fit a few dozen people in there) but we’d like to host events when we can, have games and music, a place to draw or read, and open up a patio for the warm months. Beer is our life: visiting breweries is one of our favorite pastimes, and it’s great to finally have one to call our own.\nHow would you describe your beer style?\nMan, we've had a way tougher time giving an answer to this than we'd expected (in general, that is. Not just in this specific instance). The phrase we settled on was \"classic American styles brewed using Belgian techniques,\" which is accurate, although from time to time people tend to assume it's meaningless marketing gibberish (if roles were reversed, I probably would too).\nJared’s loosely in charge of recipe development, and his Moment of Beer Awakening happened in Belgium, which had a pretty big influence on what he tends to look for in beer - he’s all about those bone-dry, super expressive beers. But at the same time, we both strongly prefer to drink local, so most of our day-to-day drinking has stronger roots in American brewing culture, which has had just as much (if not more) of an influence on how we brew.\nSo what it boils down to is that we're trying to draw out what we think of as the best aspects of these two fairly different brewing/drinking cultures. We tend to think we hit the mark on that, but we'll have to see if other people agree!\nWhy Everett?\nThe original reason we looked at our current space in Everett is kind of lame - basically, we spent months looking everywhere around Boston that might have a space we could use (we had a pretty narrow set of requirements) and the space that best suited our needs just happened to be in Everett. But oh man, we’re so glad we ended up here! We love this town! Everybody we've met - be it residents, people in city hall, or even other local businesses - has been extremely welcoming. We're lucky we found a place that fits so well with what we're all about.\nWho in the industry are you looking at for inspiration? Are there any local brewers on the list?\nI don't know if it counts as inspiration per se, but almost all of the breweries in the area have been really good to us. In particular, Chris from Idle Hands has been the most welcoming person that we've encountered in the local beer scene - Jared did a brewday or twoday with him a ways back, and we’ve been sporadically getting advice/info from him in the intervening time. The Boston beer scene is lucky to have as many good people as it does, and that’s a big part of the reason why we wanted to start a brewery there.\nHops or yeast?\nHa! Somehow we have never been asked this before. We love hops as much as anyone else, but we gotta go with yeast. It is a lovely and curious little critter that has a huge effect on how the final product tastes and it doesn’t seem like folks put too much thought into it as they’re drinking a beer. Maybe because you can’t see it? Maybe it seems too sciencey? Maybe it’s just not flashy enough?\nAnyway, yeast commonly plays second fiddle to hops (particularly in American brewing!) but it’s hugely important so we’re waving our foam fingers for our microscopic friends! After all, if it weren't for yeast, we'd have no alcohol and then nobody would have a reason to give a damn about hops.\nWe’re still gonna bow down to our lupulin masters, of course, but we know that humble saccharomyces is the real power behind the throne. With that in mind, we created a proprietary Bone Up yeast blend that we’ll be brewing with, and that adds a really nice layer of complexity to what would otherwise be standard American styles.\nLooks like you've done a lot by hand in the build out. Talk a little about why and what that means to you all.\nBeer is a reflection of the brewer, and that carries into the place it’s made as well, so we think it makes a lot of sense for us to put our personal touch on everything we can. Plus we’ve been to so many breweries that by the time we started that we had a pretty solid idea of what we did and didn’t want to do for the taproom, and it turns out you can’t readily buy a lot of that stuff. So we made it.\nThe building we’re located in is very, uh, industrial and we want to let that show through a little that while balancing it out with a cozy aspect - that way folks will want to stay and have a pint but still be aware that they are, in fact, inside a brewery. Since we have such a specific idea for exactly how we want things to be, it just makes sense for us to have a hand in things as much as we can: we want as much of Bone Up coming from the two of us as possible. We’re also fortunate enough to know some folks who are quite crafty in the wood shop, so we’ve had lots of help along the way too - for example, Jared’s dad built the bar from scratch (we are very impressed).\nWhat inspired the logo and name?\nThat's a story that's really more long than it is interesting, so it'll suffice to say that the logo was inspired by a crude drawing that Jared scribbled on a bar napkin five years ago. I think we still have it somewhere.\nThe rest is all history: Jared had his heart set on a mustachioed skull logo, Jimbo had her heart set on a mustachioed skull logo, so we made a mustachioed skull logo.\nWhen we first got going, the brewery was going under a different moniker. After a few months, we found out that we had to change it in order to avoid any potential trademark lawsuits, which meant brainstorming a new one in fairly short order. We already had a cool skull & bones theme that we liked, so we wanted the new name to tie in with that somehow. That, coupled with Jared’s tendency to… pontificate about beer led us to Bone Up. So if you wanna come in to the taproom, kick back, and have a pint in your hand without worry, we encourage that. But if you wanna learn a little (or a lot) more about how that pint in your hand came to be, we’ll tell you all about it.\nWhat is your favorite bone? Mine’s the sun.\nI'm pretty fond of my skull, but I don't think that really qualifies since it's made of way more than one bone. So... tibia? Fibula? Middle left manual distal phalanx?\nYour beer is made from ingredients. Thank god. Care to comment?\nThe short answer is: we used that slogan because we think it’s funny. We’re not gonna give you a whole flag-waving song and dance about our finest-quality ingredients and so on - beer is meant to be enjoyed. We do think you should care about your beer and you should care about where it comes from, but beer is at its heart a sociable beverage - you’re allowed to just drink it and have a good time.\nThere's nearly 4 billion breweries in the US now (ok 4,000) how are you different? How will you survive?\nWe don't want to get all philosophical on you, but the recent uptick in the number of breweries seems like it has a lot to do with the push to support the local economy. There’s a lot more people who want to buy things that were made nearby (bonus if it’s by people they know), and we want to be a part of that.\nAs for what makes us different, I can't say there isn't anyone else out there doing what we're doing, but there’s no direct comparison that springs to mind. Especially not locally. We've always been focused on just doing our own thing, and we intend to survive by making good beer and providing people with a comfortable, friendly atmosphere in which to drink it.\nUltimately staying local or hoping to expand outside of the borders?\nWe’ll be starting distribution solely in the Boston area because there’s only one car, two of us, and three barrel batches. We're planning on expanding some, but a big part of our original goal was to add to the beer scene here in Boston so there's no real need to try and expand super far. We just want to make a living brewing beer for our community.\nBone Up will be a taproom-focused brewery because that’s our favorite type of place to visit: go see where the beer is made, maybe chat with the brewer, sit on a couch and read a comic, buy a pretzel, pat yourself on the back for supporting a small business, take a growler or a couple bombers home, and call it a day while being amazed this magical place is like ten minutes from your house.\nFavorite beer right now outside of your own? Your favorite beer in your catalog?\nIs it open? Is it in my hand? That is my favorite beer, double favorite if I’ve just finished up a brew day. Aside from that? You can’t go wrong with Rodenbach Grand Cru or Alesmith Speedway Stout.\nAs for our own beers, I feel like I'm supposed to say something like \"I can't choose. My beers are my children, I love them all,\" but I'm gonna go with Extra Naked, mugs down. It’s a beer that’s hella tasty start to finish and you always want more when you’re done.\nIs there a chance we will be able to taste anything before the opening or will the first public consumption happen then?\nWe haven’t been shy about meeting up for beers and sharing pilot batch growlers (well, since we can't use our real brewing equipment yet, it's just homebrew. But saying \"pilot batch\" makes me feel so cool), but generally speaking we will not have beer available until we can brew it on our commercial system.\nWe’ll be starting out with a soft opening at the brewery, with tastings and to-go growler fills available. Once we receive our pouring license (we’re expecting that to take about a month), we’ll be able to put the taproom into full action, serve full pours and flights of our beers, and have a big ol’ grand opening.\nDo you have any liquor stores/restaurants lined up?\nWe’ve been in contact with a few bars and have a list of places we’d like to be available at, but since we don’t have a definitive opening date we haven’t been actively lining up accounts. Our beer will be draft only to begin with, so it might be a little while until we’re in retail stores/bottle shops, but we’re open to the idea of pre-filling growlers for retail shops if there’s demand for it. That being said, we’re hoping the brewery’s relatively accessible location will be a draw for people to come and grab the freshest possible beer right from the source. Since we’ll be focusing solely on the Boston area, it’s not like you have to travel very far!", "external_links": ["https://www.boneup.beer/blog", "https://twitter.com/boneupbrewing"], "published": "2015-10-13T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:10:24.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
