When she said in an interview that she'd love to work with Prince, he contacted her and this debut album is the result, co-produced by him, recorded at his Paisley Park studio in Minneapolis and released on his NPG label. Hill also guests on his recent HITNRUN Phase One album.\nShare article Predictably, then, the master's fingerprints are all over Back In Time, from the loose-limbed funk of openers As Trains Go By and Turn Up to the pheromone-laced Wild Tonight.
