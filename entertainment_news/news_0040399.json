Those adult diapers were for his 80-plus-year-old mother, who lives with him.\n• • •\nWHO’S AFRAID OF ALDUB?: Derek Ramsay has reportedly replaced Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista as Kris Aquino’s leading man in “All You Need Is Pag-ibig,” formerly called “Love, Luv, Lab” (title keeps on changing).\nHeard that the Star Cinema entry to the 2015 MMFF shall also feature two other equally popular love teams: Kim Chiu-Xian Lim, and Jody Sta. Maria-Ian Veneracion of “Pangako Sa ’Yo” fame.\nThe December film fest offers a looming battle of love teams as we have stated in a previous column. It’s all because AlDub, today’s hottest tandem, will be there, as co-stars to Vic Sotto and Ai Ai de las Alas in “My Bebe Luv.”\nAnother hot love team, James Reid and Nadine Lustre (of “On the Wings Of Love”) provide added attraction to another MMFF entry, the Vice Ganda-Coco Martin starrer, “Beauty And The Bestie.”\nNow, who’s afraid of AlDub?\n• • •\nWHAT’S BAE : People ask, what does Bae as a prefix to Alden Richards stand for?\n‘PAMBANSANG BAE’ Alden Richards\nSince soaring to the peak of his popularity as the other half of popular TV love team AlDub, Alden has been addressed by his star builders and followers alike as Pambansang Bae. What does it mean, really?\nAccording to Urban Dictionary, bae is an acronym that stands for “before anyone else,” or a shortened version of baby or babe, another word for sweetie, and, mostly unrelated, poop in Danish. In addition, “bae” has appeared in rap songs and countless web memes since the mid-2000’s.\nThe baby boy name Bae is also used as a girl name. Its pronunciation is Beh. Bae is largely used in the Korean language, and it is derived from Korean and Vietnamese origins. From Korean roots, its meaning is inspiration.\nBae. Baby. Babe. Bebe. Pabebe. There you go.\n• • •\nHERMANO PULE QUITS : Gil Portes says his proposed entry to MMFF 2015, has officially backed out of competition.\nHis entry, “Hermano Pule,” a historical drama, won’t be produced anymore this year, hopefully next year.\nPortes says their investor decided not to finance the film for various reasons.\n“Hermano’s” backing out leaves a slot open in the December film festival. Being No. 9 on the short list, it looks like Erik Matti’s “Honor Thy Father” shall see the light of the MMFF screens, after all.\nThe film stars John Lloyd Cruz in a career-changing role.\n• • •\nONE MORE CHANCE 2 : A sequel to the 2007 megahit, “One More Chance 2” is being rushed by Star Cinema to meet a November playdate.\nReuniting the John Lloyd Cruz-Bea Alonzo loveteam, “OMC-2” revisits whatever happened to the couple’s popular characters, Popoy and Basha, respectively.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:49:16.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
