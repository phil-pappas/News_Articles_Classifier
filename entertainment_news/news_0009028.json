My new love is secretive, and I'm unsure about a lot, even though he says he loves me very much. Will we be together, have a future?\nAnswer: Will you have a future? Possibly, but you'll both have to work at it. A union of feeling and intellect is worth shooting for, but you must learn to recognize the madness and magic that your Pisces guy brings to the table.
