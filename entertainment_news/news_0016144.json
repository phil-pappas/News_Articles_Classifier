In 1997, her Gary Harrison co-write \"Strawberry Wine\" was named Song of the Year by both the Country Music Association and the NSAI. The two-time Grammy nominee has earned a dozen BMI songwriter awards, is a gifted performer in her own right, and was one of Hank's favorite songwriters.\nErin Enderlin - Erin has had songs recorded by artists Alan Jackson , Lee Ann Womack , Luke Bryan , Joey + Rory, and Tyler Farr , including the award-winning singles \"Monday Morning Church\" and \"Last Call.\" A featured artist on the Willie Nelson Country Throwdown Tour in 2011, the Arkansas native has opened shows for Marty Stuart , Kip Moore , and Diamond Rio , and performed at the Grand Ole Opry , the famed Ryman Auditorium and Billy Bob's Texas .\nKalisa Ewing – A native Tennessean, Kalisa's songs have been recorded by Kelly Clarkson and Kellie Pickler , and been showcased on and included in the Season 2 soundtrack of the popular television show, NASHVILLE . She recently performed on the Grand Ole Opry A t The Ryman, and shared the stage with Loretta Lynn in May. Her sweet Country voice and hauntingly beautiful lyrics drove her to follow in the footsteps of her late grandfather, who moved to Music City in 1972 to pursue his dreams.\nMarla Cannon-Goodman – Marla grew up surrounded by some of the greatest songwriters in the business, including her father, songwriter/producer Buddy Cannon . Her first cut, \"The Fool,\" recorded by LeeAnn Womack , hit #1 on the Country charts, jump-starting a career that features recordings by Blake Shelton , Kenny Chesney , George Strait , Sammy Kershaw , Billy Currington , Eric Church , and many others. She has reached #1 with two more songs: \"Ten Rounds of Jose Cuervo \" by Tracy Byrd and \"Cleaning This Gun\" by Rodney Atkins .\nIn addition to these singer/songwriters, several \"special guests\" will be on hand.\nCreated in honor of NSAI Hall of Fame and Grammy award-winner Hank Cochran , who passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2010, the Fund raised over $11,000 with its first benefit in July. This show promises to match the excitement of that inaugural event – and supporters hope that the reasonable ticket price will pack the house. \"These are among the premiere songwriters in Nashville ,\" notes Booth Calder Cochran, co-founder of TPF . \"That they all happen to be women – and great entertainers - would delight Hank!\"\nThe death rate for pancreatic cancer is an astonishing 93%; treatment can bankrupt families and worries over financial matters create their own problems. \"The goal of the Fund is to lend direct assistance to songwriters who are affected by this cancer,\" states Booth. \"We would love to help further research and see early diagnostic testing implemented, but right now our main focus has to be on those who have already been stricken with this deadly disease.\"\nFor more information on The Pen Fund , visit www.hankcochran.com or www.facebook.com/ThePenFund .\nTo learn more about the Nikki Mitchell Foundation visit www.nikkimitchellfoundation.org or https://www.facebook.com/NikkiMitchellFoundation .
