The film was rumored to be titled as Janatha Garage , with a tagline 'Anni Rakala Repair Lu Cheyabadunu' (All types of repairs can be done). \nKoratala Siva was in fact supposed to work with NTR before Srimanthudu. But the project did not materialize and Siva moved on with Mahesh Babu's Srimanthudu while NTR became busy with Puri Jagannadh's Temper. \nNow, after scoring a huge blockbuster, Siva has got back to NTR with a powerful story and the duo is expected to come up with a smashing hit. \nNTR is currently busy shooting for Sukumar's Nannaku Prematho but has however put another film on track before finishing off one, which is surprising many. Nevertheless, Nandamuri fans were happy with their idol's move as he has finally increased the pace of his films. \nOn the other hand, NTR fans also got to witness some adorable moments at the opening ceremony yesterday, as NTR attended the event along with his wife Lakshmi Pranathi and Son Abhay Ram . \nCheck out some of the unseen and cute pictures of NTR and his wife playing with their son, in the slides below.
