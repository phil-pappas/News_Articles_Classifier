Britto Central gallery will continue to operate within this space through the first quarter of 2016, at which time it will move to 1102 Lincoln Road, a traditional gallery space, and 532 Lincoln Road which will serve as the test grounds for a new concept store with plans of global expansion.\nThe move to two new storefronts echoes the growth occurring in Miami , and the pedestrian mall itself. A prolific creator, Britto has exhibited his work across four continents, in almost 300 exhibitions and in more than 20 museum shows. As the artist continues to reinterpret the meaning of art and its role in contemporary life, his work and therefore work space also continues to expand exponentially.\nOccupying the former \"Serendipity\" location, 1102 Lincoln Road represents a return to Britto's roots with a focus on originals works. The high end and upscale environment will truly showcase his vibrant aesthetic as well as his vision and passion for fine art. 532 Lincoln Road on the other hand will showcase collectibles and limited edition fine works in a new store concept.\n\"I am so very grateful to have this opportunity to fulfill my dreams to not only be able to expand but to also continue to share my art with the world after 20 plus years of opening my gallery,\" said the Brazilian-born, Miami -made artist.\nAfter experiencing a warm welcome to the United States , Britto knew he would plant roots in Miami and did with his 1994 opening of the very first gallery on what is now the bustling high-traffic destination of Lincoln Road that we know today, making him a true pioneer.\nThroughout its 21 year existence, Britto Central gallery has hosted thousands of collectors from around the globe, from Asia to South America and well across Europe in addition to old friends such as Marilyn Monroe's last co-star Eli Wallach and his wife, actor and former Governor of the State of California Arnold Schwarzenegger while filming True Lies, astronaut Buzz Aldrin, longtime friend and supporter Paulo Coelho , numerous patrons of the arts including the Arison, Braman, and Slim families to name a few.\nDemonstrating his ongoing commitment to the City of Miami Beach , and to the community at large, Britto has chosen to remain on Lincoln Road in appreciation of his humble beginnings and acknowledgement to early South Florida supporters. Britto remains loyal to the community by donating his time, art, and resources as he has always done as he strongly believes art is too important not to share.\nABOUT ROMERO BRITTO\nBrazilian-born and Miami -made, Romero Britto is an internationally renowned iconic pop artist that uses vibrant, bold and colorful patterns to reflect his optimistic faith in the world around him. Britto's work evokes happiness and hope using a visual language all its own that is relatable to everyone. Self-taught at an early age, Britto painted on any medium he could find before coming into his own and traveling to Paris where he was introduced to the works of Matisse and Picasso, which influenced him to create an iconic style that The New York Times described, \"exudes warmth, optimism and love.\"\nBritto's work has been exhibited in galleries and museums in over 100 countries, including the Salon de la Societe Nationale des Beaux Arts exhibition at the Carrousel du Louvre in 2008 and 2010. In 2013, Maria Elena and Carlos Slim Domit invited Romero to be the first living artist to exhibit at Museo Soumaya. He has created public art installations for the 02 Dome in Berlin , John F. Kennedy Airport, Cirque Du Soleil at Super Bowl XLI, and has been credited with the largest monumental sculpture in Hyde Park's history. Britto served as an official artist for the 2010 World Cup, Ambassador to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil and was recently appointed Global Ambassador to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games by the Olympic Committee of Brazil. Britto's pop sensibility has since leant itself to many collaborations with international brands such as Audi, Bentley, Coca-Cola, Disney, Evian, Hublot, Mattel, and Technomarine. Romero is an activist for charitable organizations worldwide and most of all an artist who believes \"art is too important not to share.\" Britto donates to over 250 charitable organizations a year. Not a silent activist, Britto was a selected speaker for the arts at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland . In addition, Romero Britto is proudly an Inaugural Founding Benefactor of the Harvard International Negotiation Program. He holds a seat on several boards such as Best Buddies International, and St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, and was recently appointed to the board of HRH The Prince of Wales charity, The Prince's Trust. A believer in the role of an artist as an agent of positive change, Romero Britto is committed to developing and supporting the role art will continue to play in world issues.\nMEDIA CONTACT\nNicole Bostick\nBritto Central, Inc.\nn.bostick@britto.com\n786.334.6005\n releases/internationally-acclaimed-pop-artist-romero-britto-inks-deal-to-expand-landmark-britto-central-gallery-to-two-new-locations-on-lincoln-road-300158286.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL26038&Transmission_Id=201510130730PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL26038&DateId=20151013", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/internationally-acclaimed-pop-artist-romero-britto-inks-deal-to-expand-landmark-britto-central-gallery-to-two-new-locations-on-lincoln-road-300158286.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:42:34.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
