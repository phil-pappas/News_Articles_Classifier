Though locals last saw her on TV Tuesday night in pre-recorded stages of the singing show, Nicole has a short stint home before heading back to Los Angeles for more filming. \n\"It always feels good to just be home,\" she said, though Nicole hasn't been taking any time off in Delaware. In between performing other shows, she's spending extra time with her daughter and feeding her cat, she said. \nBut local Delaware residents didn't mind her short performance, as many lined up for autographs and selfies long before and after her show. More than 5,700 people pre-registered for the free annual camp-out, complete with Halloween-themed festivities and costume contest, as well as food, crafts and hayrides. Many more decided upon arrival that they would stay the night, as colorful tents dotted the hills and fields inside the park. \nSophia Hanson, general manager for the county's Department of Community Services, called the event a \"huge success,\" adding that it's one of the only free events located in the county. The only charge for patrons were purchases made to the many food trucks set up within the camp site. \nBefore Hanson corralled her own children, she paused to hug Nicole, wishing her the best of luck as she moves forward with the competition and assuring her of future success. \n\"My cheeks hurt,\" Nicole said with a laugh. \"But it doesn't feel much different yet, except when I'm online and there are people from Brazil supporting me and saying Team Nadjah to me. ... I just don't want kids to be disappointed if I don't make it too far and then they think they can't do it.\" \nMost kids were just excited to be in her presence — and able to run free from their parents within the park grounds. Children raced up and down the hills with hula-hoops, footballs and costume accessories, eager to get to the next activity or show off their best dance moves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:36:27.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
