Rollo Ross reports.   \nA light-hearted comment by 'Maze Runner' actor Dylan O'Brien has prompted outrage by Native American advocacy groups. The actor said in a recent interview with US morning talk show 'Live with Kelly and Michael' that he had fallen ill during the second in the franchise 'The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials'. He blamed the sickness on a Native American curse saying he and fellow cast members had taken items from an ancient burial ground during filming. He said \"They were very strict about littering and don't take any artifacts like rocks, skulls - anything like that. And everyone just takes stuff, you know, obviously.\" The remark has prompted an online petition by more than 53,000 people demanding a return of the stolen items. O'Brien's publicist did not return a request for comment, but the film's distributor 20th Century Fox said it is doing a 'thorough investigation'.  //reut.rs/1Mh0w1v", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:57:03.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
