Sometimes when you're doing well, you're afraid to say something's wrong because then there's going to be a bunch of people out there going 'OK, well, you're a big old movie star.' But it doesn't matter.'' \nJessica said it's wrong actors are paid more than their female counterparts for doing the same job in a movie. \nThe flame-haired actress added: ''There's no excuse. There's no reason why she should be doing a film with other actors and get paid less than her male co-stars. \n''It's completely unfair. It's not right. It's been happening for years and years and years. I think it's brave to talk about it. I think everyone should talk about it.''
