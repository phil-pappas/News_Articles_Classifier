AFP \nCathriona White, Jim Carrey’s ex-girlfriend who committed suicide last week, died of a drug overdose. \nAccording to TMZ , the pills that White overdosed on were prescribed to a male that law enforcement believe belonged to Carrey. \nThe prescription drugs consisting of three bottles were discovered next to White’s bed, adds the site, and \"were all prescribed to a fictitious male\". \nAccording to TMZ , the majority of celebrities use an alias for these sorts of things for \"privacy reasons\". \nLaw enforcement sources have revealed to TMZ , that the pills were indeed prescribed to Carrey. \nA source has revealed to the site, that it is being speculated that White may have stolen the pills from Carrey’s home. \nAccording to TMZ , authorities believe that White died of an overdose, but are clueless as to which of the three prescribed pills ended her life – something which only a toxicology test could answer, added the site. \nSources revealed to TMZ , that authorities also want to interview Carrey. \nTMZ reports that White informed five people that Carrey had reportedly dumped her on September 24, 2015 and that she was apparently \"distraught\". \nWhite’s lifeless body was discovered by these five people five days later, along with a suicide note \"addressed\" to Carrey, reports TMZ .
