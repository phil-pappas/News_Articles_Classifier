His first film was Podaa Podi, which garnered only a lukewarm response at the box office. His second film, Naanum Rowdy Dhaan (NRD), starring Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi, is in the post-production stage. Personally, his relationship with actress Nayanthara has been under the scanner, and was highlighted when a leaked picture of Vignesh with the actress did the rounds online. In a candid chat with Times of India, Vignesh Shivan talks about NRD, how controversies have affected him and more. Excerpts...\nIt has been three years since Podaa Podi. What took you so long to make NRD?\nThere were casting issues. Initially, I wanted to make the film with music director Anirudh. He had liked the script and even agreed to do it. However, one day, he felt that acting would be a distraction for him. As his friend, I didn't want that, because he is doing well as a musician. I had first written the script keeping the role of a 16-year-old in mind. Anirudh would have been perfect for it. Once he backed out, I had to rework the script. I then approached Vijay Sethupathi.\nThere were rumours that Nayanthara and you were in a relationship, when the photo of the two of you together was leaked online...\nEverything is online these days. Even a small bit of information is immediately put up on Twitter or sent via WhatsApp. The biggest of stars are accessible through social media, and thus, messages reach them instantly. I have also been at the receiving end of it...\nSo, how did you handle it?\nPeople will say anything that they think will excite others. A simple saying like 'man bites dog' is more interesting than the other way round. A lot of stuff has been said about me. People said I was a Malayali because I have Shivan in my name just like Santhosh Sivan does. But I'm a Tamilian. People don't understand that the way they say certain things, and the words they use, can hurt others. They give so many variations to a story without knowing what the truth actually is. Ultimately, after all the drama, I just tell myself to forget it. I don't read the papers at all these days. I don't want to know what's happening around me, and I don't wish to know as well. I'm not saying this to make myself look superior. If I talk about my personal issues, they say it is to promote my film. I'm not that desperate that I need to stoop down to such levels to promote my films.\nHow did Nayanthara respond?\nIt doesn't matter to her if people talk about it, because her movies are doing well. Plus, she is not someone who dwells on such issues. Finding an actress who is as hard-working and dedicated as her is not easy. When people write gossip about her, that day's work might be a little slow. But she is the kind of person who will brush it aside, and start working. She is a thorough professional.\nDo you want to clarify your stand on your relationship issue?\nWork is my only love now. Nothing else matters. I am not being diplomatic. I am only concentrating on my movie and I hope it works for me. Things like Nayanthara playing a deaf girl, or Parthepan playing a baddie in this film haven't been in focus, thanks to this one controversy. I believe people can do whatever they want to in their personal life, but work is different. At the end of the day, it is about the film. That's what comes first for her also.\nTell us about Naanum Rowdy Dhaan...\nWe have tried a different genre called emotional comedy in this film. It is an emotional story but it has been treated in a comic way. We have been promoting the film in an innovative way by releasing a single track every week. On the lines of Dev D, the songs of this film, too, will play a key role in the screenplay. Though most of the songs are romantic numbers, they have been written based on some concept. Vijay Sethupathi is playing a wannabe rowdy in the film. According to his role, he has a fascination for becoming a rowdy but he has no traits of becoming one. His character will be on the lines of Vadivelu's one-liner, 'Naanum rowdy dhaan'. Interestingly Vijay Sethupathi's mother is a cop in the film. While his mother wants him to become a cop, he aspires to become a rowdy. The fact is that my mother is a cop and generally kids of cops are a little different from their parents â€” they tend to be quiet. In my case, I was never interested in joining the police force, because right from my childhood I have seen the challenges in a cop's life. Though I have not shown much negativity in the movie, I have narrated a little about the drawbacks of cop families. Like for example, in Yennai Arindhaal, Ajith would quit his job because he had to protect his daughter. If you ask the daughter, she may have a different point of view altogether. While Radhika plays a cop, Nayanthara's father is also a cop in the film.\nWhat is Nayanthara's role in the movie?\nShe has an interesting character in the film. She is playing a hearing-impaired girl for the first time, someone who has lost her hearing but has the ability to lip-read. Her character's name is Kadambari. Interestingly, Parthepan is playing a negative role for the first time. He is the main don. Vijay Sethupathi has lost close to 15 kilos to look young and he ensured that he also looked smart in the film. His son is also playing a small role in the movie. He plays Vijay's younger version in the film.
