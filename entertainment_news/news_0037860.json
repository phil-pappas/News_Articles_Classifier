He just happens to be running on the wrong continent,\" Noah said.\nThen, there are the tall tales Trump has told, most recently on stage at the Republican debate, about otherwise healthy and beautiful children allegedly developing autism within days of receiving vaccines.\n\"Was that factual? No? But was it presidential? Depends where you come from,\" Noah said, cutting to a news report about Gambian President Yahya Jammeh claiming he is able to cure AIDS with bananas and herbs.\nBut the similarities didn't end there. Noah and his team of archival researchers were able to unearth footage of notorious figures Idi Amin and Robert Mugabe making grandiose, decidedly Trump-like pronouncements.\n\"If anything happens to Trump, We have a backup copy in Africa,\" Noah joked.\nThe segment built to a comparison between the former host of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" and arguably the most infamous African villain of all time, Moammar Gadhafi.\n\"Weird hair? Check. Lavish lifestyle? Check. Fringe discredited views about President Obama's origins?\" Noah said, launching into footage of the late Libyan dictator suggesting Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim -- virtually identical to claims made for years by Trump. \"Check.\"\nAs Noah observed, Gadhafi even set up a tent on the grounds of Trump's Bedford, N.Y., estate during a 2009 visit to the United States: \"He could have stayed anywhere, but the only place he felt truly at home was in Donald Trump's yard.\"\nThe comedian ended the segment by urging Americans to make another historic decision in 2016.\n\"It's time to be bold once more and elect America's first African president.\"\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731815&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731815&h=Why+Trevor+Noah+thinks+Donald+Trump+could+be+%27America%27s+first+African+president%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731815"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:38:43.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
