He then allegedly tried to push his way past security, but was blocked before deciding to leave. \nEyewitnesses claim he began running down the street and illegally crossed a road directly in front of police officers, who issued the actor a warning. When he reportedly failed to stop jaywalking, he was placed in handcuffs and taken in to Travis County Jail for booking and later released on his own recognisance. \nRepresentatives for LaBeouf have yet to comment on the news. \nIt's not the first time the 29-year-old has been arrested - he was busted for disorderly conduct last year after disrupting a Broadway performance of \"Cabaret\" and tussling with police outside the theater. As part of his punishment, he was ordered to enrol in an alcohol treatment program, which he completed earlier this year.
