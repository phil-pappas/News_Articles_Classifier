The following contains spoilers from \"Blue Bloods\"]\nNYC Police Commissioner Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck) is in danger of losing his indispensable right hand man on Friday's episode of \"Blue Bloods.\"\nReagan's Public information Officer Garrett Moore (Gregory Jbara) is offered another job –at a much higher salary—to go work for a university.\nClick here to subscribe to FOX411’s YouTube channel\nAnd for Garrett, the money isn't the only reason for considering leaving the police department. He feels Frank is disappointed in him because he had pressed the commissioner to allow reporter Lorenzo Colt (Zachary Booth) to go on a \"ride along\" with Frank's police officer son Jamie (Will Estes) and his partner Eddie (Vanessa Ray).\nViewers see Jamie, Eddie, and Colt respond to a call about gunfire in an apartment building. And disaster strikes when Colt, wearing NYPD garb and sitting in a patrol car, is shot by a mystery assailant and must be hospitalized.\nFrank believes that because Colt wore a police windbreaker, the shooter probably thought he was attacking a cop.\nGarrett says he feels responsible but Frank snaps at him, \"You're not.\"\nMeanwhile, both Frank's sons are involved in the case as detective Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg) and his partner Maria Baez (Maria Ramirez) follow up with the reporter, who is recovering from the shooting but is completely uncooperative.\nDanny asks him questions about the assailant but Colt claims he remembers nothing. Still, he appears to be writing an article on his computer from his hospital bed.\nLater, Baez tells Danny that Colt has published a composite picture of his shooter -- on his own reporting website.\nDanny and Maria confront the reporter and he says he has an obligation to inform his readers, not to tell the cops anything.\nA disgusted Danny talks to his Assistant District Attorney sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan) about getting together an investigative grand jury on the case so that the reporter will be subpoenaed and forced to testify about what he knows.\nBut Erin refuses and accuses him of overstepping because of his wife Linda's (Amy Carlson) worries about his dangerous profession.\nIndeed, in an earlier scene, viewers see Linda sitting like a zombie in their backyard and telling Danny she thinks something bad will happen to him.\nThe nurse recalls how she was shot at the hospital months before due to one of Danny's cases; she doesn't want her husband to go to work but Danny insists, \"I can't quit my job.\"\nEventually, Danny and Maria take a suspect into custody in the reporter's shooting.\nMichael Hicks has a long history of violence against police and at his interrogation, Hicks sneers, \"Oink, oink\" and calls Danny \"little piggy,\" after being confronted with his record.\nLater, Colt is called in to identify his shooter in a police lineup but denies he recognizes anyone to Danny's frustration.\nGarrett defensively asks his longtime boss Frank how he was supposed to know Colt wasn't more like Woodward and Bernstein.\nGarrett then tells Frank that Jim, the university head, had offered him a job at a very high salary.\n\"If you want to leave, don't put it on me,\" Frank grumbles.\nGarrett accuses Frank of being behind the job offer because he knows Jim, but Frank denies it.\nAt the Reagan family Sunday dinner, Danny's sons wonder why the reporter was refusing to help the police, and why he was riding in the cop car in the first place.\nFrank says the responsibility is all his and Danny tells his sons they had to let Hicks out of jail.\nA distraught Linda tells the boys to stop because \"there is something very wrong with the fact that every time that this family sits down for dinner we have to talk about crime and criminals. Couldn't we just for once…sit together and have a normal family dinner?!\"\nThen Frank, who has taken a phone call, announces that the reporter Colt is dead.\nAt the scene, Colt's body lies on the hood of a car and it looks like he had been pushed from the building above.\nDanny has discovered the reporter was wearing camera glasses that show Colt trying to interview Hicks at the top of the building, and the suspect pushing him to his death.\nWith the case solved, Danny tells Hicks triumphantly, \"Oink, oink.\"\nDanny comes home and assures Linda, \"I'm alive.\" She promises she's going to get better soon.\nBack at the commissioner's office, Frank asks Garrett to stay on a month and train his replacement before accepting the better paying job.\nBut he adds gruffly, \"Better yet, just stay on, period. Please stay, because I need you and you need me.\"\nHe offers Garrett a three percent raise which the public information officer agrees to consider--and the episode ends with the two tough guys heading out for drinks together.\n\"Blue Bloods\" airs Friday on CBS.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ1nqIgM_yUiQVJBg_RR6Q?sub_confirmation=1"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:11:25.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
