Close Review: Goodspeed presents a musical adaptation of ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ Performing \"First Class All the Way,\" Ed Dixon as Mr. Potter tempts Duke Lafoon as George Bailey with dreams of wealth and power in \"A Wonderful Life,\" now through Nov. 29 at Goodspeed Opera House. (Diane Sobolewski) Published October 24. 2015 12:01AM By Kristina Dorsey \n“It’s a Wonderful Life” is a magical movie. It’s sentimental, sure, and old-fashioned, but it’s also as emotionally affecting as anything from Hollywood’s golden era. \nAll of which makes it tempting — but challenging — for those who would want to give the story a new “Life.” \nEnter Sheldon Harnick and Joe Raposo. These two musical legends joined up in the 1980s to create a stage-musical version of “It’s a Wonderful Life.” You might think of them as a dream team: Harnick was the lyricist for “Fiddler on the Roof,” and Raposo was the songwriter behind the “Sesame Street” theme song, among many other memorable tunes. They collaborated on “A Wonderful Life” for a number of years (Harnick is credited with book and lyrics, Raposo with the music), but Raposo, alas, died in 1989. Harnick continued developing “A Wonderful Life” afterward, and, in 1991, the show was produced professionally for the first time at Arena Stage in Washington. \nGoodspeed Musicals is staging the piece at its opera house this fall. The Goodspeed production, directed by Michael Perlman, is a solid one. The story’s themes remain powerful, as they deal with the importance of community and of sacrificing for the greater good — and of everyone’s having an impact on more people than they could ever realize. \nThe songs, though, don’t bring much to the tale. Compare this to “La Cage aux Folles,” which was the previous show to grace Goodspeed’s stage. There, the tunes added immeasurably to the storyline pulled from a French play, and they were electric joys that deepened our understanding of a character or a situation. In “A Wonderful Life,” the score is agreeable but rather bland — not near the genius-level creations of which Harnick and Raposo are capable. \nThis “Wonderful Life” does, however, benefit from some fine performances. Duke Lafoon steps into Jimmy Stewart’s best-known role as George Bailey, and he navigates that tough task with grace. He echoes just enough of film star, especially with the occasional Stewartonian pauses and gentle geniality, to pay tribute without becoming a slavish copy. Lafoon is deeply believable in all of George’s guises, from happy husband to distraught businessman, and he provides a fine center for “A Wonderful Life.” \nHe shares an easy chemistry with Kirsten Scott, who plays Mary. This could be played as a stock character, but Scott infuses Mary with a quiet intelligence and doesn’t lose any ebullience in the process. Just as important, Scott possesses a crystalline singing voice. Her duets with Lafoon on such titles as “A Wonderful Life” and “Good Night” carry a lush romanticism. \nProviding those two well-meaning characters with plenty of trouble: Ed Dixon brings a commanding presence and a simmering but delicious villainy as the nefarious Mr. Potter. He juts his jaw and holds his stance in an alpha-male way, suggesting someone who simply believes himself better than everyone else. \nIf Potter is the dark prince of “Wonderful Life,” Clarence is its bright light. Frank Vlastnik isn’t the Clarence of the film; he’s young and thin and conveys a charming guilelessness. This Clarence, with his fingerless gloves and white shoes, seems almost like a geek — but a kind, loving one. His big production number, “Wings,” is all angelic chorines and waving fabric (in the form of oversized angel wings and in the symbolic suggestion of clouds). It’s a bit out of character with the rest of the show, but it’s entertaining nonetheless. Another Clarence-related change: The scene where George saves Clarence takes place at a railroad crossing (instead of on a bridge, as in the movie), which is an interesting idea that ends up not being effectively staged. \nMany of the supporting cast members have character-rich faces that look as though they’ve been pulled right out of a 1940s Hollywood film. Their acting, too, is on target, creating a community peopled by the likes of Michael Medeiros as George’s Uncle Billy and Kevin C. Loomis as cop Bert. \nThe set feels more drab than warm and inviting, but the dancing makes up for that with its luminosity and spirit. Parker Esse’s choreography reaches its zenith, naturally, with the dance-competition number that razzle-dazzles with Charleston kicks and swinging arms. The moves are so athletic that one dancer’s pearl necklace flew clean off her neck. Now, that’s an energetic number.
