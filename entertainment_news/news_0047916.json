And so as part of that certification I went into a week of meditation teaching, which was amazing and a super great experience.\" \nMeanwhile, Emma admitted that some of her friends were worried about her after she admitted to going on a silent retreat to deal with her split from rugby player Matt Janney in December. \nEmma previously told Vogue magazine: \"I felt really uncomfortable, even before my relationship ended, I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself.\" \nHowever, a friend thought the vow of silence was permanent, with Emma explaining on Radio 1: \"I got a call from my friend asking whether I was OK because apparently I had taken a vow of silence after my breakup and I wasn't speaking and I was like \"No, I have no idea where that came from\" but I'm not mute now or anything.\" emma watson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:11:10.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
