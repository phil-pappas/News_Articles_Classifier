Pic/Santa Banta \nThe 27-year-old Grammy winner took to Twitter to make the announcement, reports aceshowbiz.com.\n\"When I was 7, I wanted to be 8. When I was 8, I wanted to be 12. When I turned 12 I just wanted to be 18. Then after that I stopped wanting to be older. Now I'm ticking 16-24 boxes just to see if I can blag it! I feel like I've spent my whole life so far wishing it away,\" Adele wrote.\n\"Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else, wishing I could remember and wishing I could forget too. Wishing I hadn't ruined so many good things because I was scared or bored,\" she added.\n\"Wishing I wasn't so matter of fact all the time. Wishing I'd gotten to know my great grandmother more, and wishing I didn't know myself so well, because it means I always know what's going to happen. Wishing I hadn't cut my hair off, wishing I was 5'7\". Wishing I'd waited and wishing I'd hurried up as well.\"\nThe 'Someone like you' hitmaker also called the follow-up to her 2001's '21' a \"make-up record.\"\n\"My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I'm making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven't got time to hold onto the crumbs of my past like I used to. What's done is done,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:52:48.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
