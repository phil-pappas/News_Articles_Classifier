To Phang's view, Will Smith's collaboration with Bomba Estero is evidence of a new mother lode: world music sounds in the mainstream. \"Performance, music, literature in the Caribbean and Latin America are a fusion of Afrocentric influences, European perspectives, and indigenous worldviews, and Canadians appreciate this, intuitively. In fact, the engagement of Canadian studios helped Cuban artistes to create music, even when the island was at its most isolated.\" Phang envisions liberalized Cuba as a golden opportunity for Canadian artistes. \"Hopefully, we'll maintain the ideal of kana:ta', the 'village.' What could be more Canadian?\"\nCaril Phang @WordsEdge has been published by the United Nations, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
