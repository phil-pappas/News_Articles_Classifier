They're not like ghosts, they're his own creations.\" \nPenned by acclaimed writer Abi Morgan, one of the brains behind Shame, The Iron Lady, and new movie Suffragette, her script was a key reason the actor signed up. \n\"I took the job for her writing because it doesn't look like anything else,\" explains Stellan. \"Her writing is not linear. It's more filled with odd impulses. \n\"It throws you from one thought to another thought in a less organised way, and to me that resembles life much more than a lot of the writing you get which is extremely structured and polished and is by the book of 'How to Write a Screenplay'.\" \nObviously cast and crew are hoping the series proves a hit, but as four of Skarsgard's recent films grossed more than $4billion between them, and with more helpings of Thor and Avengers on the way, finding time to make series two might be a little tricky. However, with a fine supporting cast, including Adeel Akhtar as Detective Sergeant Ira King; Lesley Manville as Chief Inspector Chrissie Read, and Eddie Marsan as a killer who harasses the eponymous crime buster, hopefully this is one River that will run and run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:52:30.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
