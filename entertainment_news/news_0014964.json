Spawn was once a former special forces soldier and assassin named Al Simmons, who is killed but trades his soul to come back to avenge evil. \nMcFarlane parlayed the blockbuster success of Spawn and his imprint Image Comics -- home to The Walking Dead , the graphic novel series that spawned the hit show -- into an empire that's also known for a successful, groundbreaking toy line that bears his name. \nSpawn was adapted into a movie in 1997 and an animated series on HBO that ran on HBO from 1997 to 1999, but for years, rumors of a big-screen reboot have swirled like the character's trademark cape. \nAt New York Comic Con last weekend, however, the artist/entrepreneur told ABC News Radio that real progress is being made -- and fans may see Spawn in action again sooner than they think. \n\"I just recently finished the first draft of the movie script...because the deal is I write, produce, direct it,\" McFarlane explained, noting, \"I'm gonna sort of walk away with it for about a month, and...then whittle it down.\" \n\"...[O]nce I got the second draft, it still won't be the perfect draft, but it'll be one that I can then go start attaching actors to it...and then we'll go start selling it.\" \nMcFarlane explained he's eager to fund the movie in large part by himself. \"Mel Gibson did it with Passion of the Christ ,\" he said of the Oscar winner's biblical blockbuster, \"And they just went, 'You're a fool. You don't want to use your own money.' So this is just my 'Passion of the Anti-Christ,' if you will.\" \nHe explained that some of the actors he's spoken to about the project are just as passionate, and are willing to shell out some dough to get it done. \"We'll put our money in,\" Todd enthused, \"And I'm here to tell you: you use your own money, it is the greatest freedom in the world to both succeed and/or fail...You don't have to have this layer on top of you. So we're gonna do it, we're gonna finance it, and then we'll use Hollywood as a distribution vehicle.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
