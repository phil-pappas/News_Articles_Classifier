From ancient traditions to contemporary creations and from the political to the spiritual, Libana expresses its global repertoire with close a cappella vocals and an impressive palette of instruments including oud, charango, guitar, hammered dulcimer, panpipes, dumbek, djembe, frame drum, dholak, tapan and clarinet. \nIn 1979, a group of women sharing a passion for international music, dance and women’s issues formed the global music ensemble Libana. Inspired by Judy Chicago’s groundbreaking exhibit “The Dinner Party,” Libana took its name from a woman honored by the artist, a 10th-century Moorish poet, philosopher and musician. The four founding members were joined two years by another; the newest of the six-woman ensemble has performed with Libana for 23 years. In many ways, the intentionality of Libana’s own long-term creative community mirrors the experience of communities of women everywhere on Earth who share music, dance, celebration, life-cycle ritual, food, laughter and spiritual practice to create deep moments of unity and transcendence in their collective life. \nLibana’s nine recordings and three songbooks have inspired the formation and the repertoires of song circles and choruses of all ages around the globe. The musicians have traversed the globe for 35 years celebrating the world’s women. Creating a bridge of the heart, their commitment to the artistic expression of the global community has inspired dynamic cross-cultural understanding, profound healing and widespread peace building. \nAdvance tickets are $15, $13 for those older than 65 and $10 younger than 13, available at Rock City Café, Rockland; Owl & Turtle, Camden; and brownpapertickets.com . Tickets at the door (cash/check only) will be $20/ $15/$12. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
