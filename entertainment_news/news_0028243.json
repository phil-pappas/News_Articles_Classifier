I'm still very single.'' \nThe 23-year-old star - who wrote his debut album 'In The Lonely Hour' after falling in love with a straight man - also admitted he's glad he never had a real relationship before he found fame as he believes he'd miss the normality of it. \nSam told The Sun newspaper: ''I'm trying my best. There's different challenges. \n''The blessing for me is that I didn't have a boyfriend before I got well known so I didn't know any different. \n''If I'd been in a relationship before I got well known I think I'd be a bit more upset.''
