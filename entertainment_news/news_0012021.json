Pop singer Lance Bass (R) and Michael Turchin arrive at the 2014 Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar Party in West Hollywood, California. (Reuters)\nLance Bass has revealed he was victimized by a “pedophile” who touched him inappropriately during his days with the boy band NSYNC.\nAppearing Wednesday on “The Meredith Vieira Show,” Bass, 36, made the revelation while discussing Ashley Judd 's recent claims that a Hollywood mogul sexually harassed her nearly two decades ago.\n“This also happens to men, too. It’s a two-way street,” said Bass. “It had happened to me when I was 16, 17 years old.”\nThe Sirius XM host didn’t go into specifics about other possible victims, but indicated his NSYNC bandmates — who were together professionally from 1995 to 2002 — may have also been victimized.\n“When we started there was someone that we worked with that was inappropriately touching us,” he explained. “I was even aware then, at 16, that this guy was a pedophile, and he was touching me oddly. But I didn’t feel victimized at the time because I was very aware of it.”\nThe alleged misconduct was not reported to the authorities, and the group — consisting of Bass, Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick — kept the secret with each other, Bass claimed.\n“We would kind of joke about it, but it’s not a joking thing, but as a kid, it was just odd,” he described. “I am glad that we were aware of it and we didn’t feel victimized at the time.”\nBass, who is now married to Michael Turchin, did not give a name. His assistant and manager did not immediately return requests for comment.\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/tag/lance-bass/", "http://www.nypost.com/", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/07/lance-bass-says-he-was-the-victim-of-a-pedophile-while-in-nsync/", "http://pagesix.com/tag/ashley-judd/", "http://pagesix.com/", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/06/ashley-judd-i-was-sexually-harassed-by-famous-movie-studio-mogul/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:37:46.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
