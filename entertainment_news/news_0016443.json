Live on August 25, 2014, in Los Angeles. Jason Merritt/Getty Images \nHayden Panettiere has entered a treatment facility to help with postpartum depression, her rep confirms. \nThe 26-year-old \"Nashville\" star gave birth her first child, Kaya, last December. \n\"Hayden Panettiere is voluntarily seeking professional help at a treatment center as she is currently battling postpartum depression. She asks that the media respect her privacy during this time,\" the actress's rep told Us Weekly on Tuesday. \nPanettiere's \"Nashville\" character, Juliette Barnes, has been battling a severe case of postpartum depression on the show this season. \nThe subject of postpartum depression and motherhood came up during a recent visit to \"Live! with Kelly and Michael,\" during which Panettiere said, \"I can very much relate.\" \nShe added, \"It's something a lot of women experience. When [you're told] about postpartum depression you think it's 'I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child' -- I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about.\" \nKaya is the first child for Panettiere and her fiance, professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko. © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
