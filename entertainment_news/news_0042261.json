As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\" \nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child will be the first time Harry's life has been officially explored since he waved off his eldest children, James Sirius and Albus Severus, from King's Cross's Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. \nIt is written by Jack Thorne in collaboration with JK Rowling and will be directed by Olivier and Tony award-winner John Tiffany. \nThe trio said: \"It is very exciting to explore Harry's world in a brand new way through the live form of theatre. Collaborating on this story is exhilarating for all of us and we can't wait to present the eighth story at the Palace Theatre next summer.\" \nRowling added, \"The story only exists because the right group of people came together with a brilliant idea about how to present Harry Potter on stage. I'm confident that when audiences see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they will understand why we chose to tell this story in this way.\" \nThe news it is a sequel comes after JK Rowling was forced to deny multiple times on Twitter that the show would be a prequel to the books. \nOn Friday, she tweeted, \"So now you know it really isn't a prequel: Harry Potter & the £CursedChild starts £19yearslater!\" \nOfficial artwork for the plays was revealed on Thursday featuring a boy sitting inside a nest shaped like a Golden Snitch. \nThe play has been split into two parts due to the \"epic nature of the story\" and will feature a cast of more than 30 actors. The two parts can either be seen on the same day or on consecutive days. \nDespite music by Imogen Heap, orchestration by Martin Lowe and special effects by Jeremy Chernick, The Cursed Child will not be a musical. \nIt will fly into London's West End in Summer 2016, with tickets on sale for those with priority booking from 11am on October 28 and on general sale from 11am on October 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:03:44.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
