The two music stars -- along with the other remaining contestants -- will take part in “Famous Dances Night,” where they’ll re-create iconic dance numbers from movies and music videos. \nAfter last week’s “Switch Up” performances, in which the contestants switched dance partners, Andy is back with Allison Holker and Nick reteams with Sharna Burgess. Andy and Allison will be performing to “Good Morning” from Singing in the Rain , while Nick and Sharna will hoof it to “You Should Be Dancing” from Saturday Night Fever . \nGrease star Olivia Newton-John will serve as guest judge, alongside Julianne Hough, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli. No one was sent home last week, but one couple will be eliminated at the end of the night Monday based on the lowest combined judges’ scores and viewer’s votes from the “Switch Up” and “Most Memorable Year” performances. \nLast week, Andy and Nick both landed in the middle of the leader board. Andy earned a 36 out of 40 for performing an Argentine Tango to The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face.” Nick scored a 35 out of 40 for dancing the Paso Doble to Martin Garrix and Usher’s “Don’t Look Down.” \nDancing with the Stars airs Monday on ABC at 8 p.m. ET. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
