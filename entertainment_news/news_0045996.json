But this is a film where actions, even if theyre not completely understood, are much stronger than words. Theres plenty of action right away. Kate leads an FBI team in a raid to rescue some hostages but finds something a lot worse, resulting in a frightening and bloody battle that leaves losses on both sides of the law. Its Kates coolness in a tight spot that attracts the attention of Matt Graver, a representative from Homeland Security, to ask her to volunteer for a mission involving nabbing a big Mexican drug cartel guy in Mexico. But she senses that somethings fishy here, as should anyone watching the story unfold. Graver is laid back and serious, and he displays flashes of unsettling humor. But is he really from Homeland Security? And whos this other guy, Alejandro, a really quiet and secretive fellow, who appears to be along for the plane ride to Juarez where theyll carry out the operation? About all he says to curious Kate is, Nothing will make sense to your American eyes. Even after she agrees to take part in whatever this is, nobody will tell her exactly whats going on, just that shes needed to help get the bad guys. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) often keeps his cameras way up in the sky, looking down on the vastness of Mexico, suggesting that any number of bad things could be going on in such a spread-out place. That feeling of unease gets worse when the team arrives in black SUVs and tries to make their way through the jammed Juarez streets , knowing that they could easily become targets. Its then that Kate is fed another piece of information: The state police arent always the good guys. Of the three leads, its Kate who (I believe) has the least dialogue, which means that Blunt spends most of the film looking around nervously, even as bullets fly and bodies fall around her. When shes finally brought in on what their mission is really about, she freaks, but is told, firmly, by Brolin to watch and learn. Yet even at that point, its not completely clear whats going on or who the people shes with are. This turns into a story of one instance of shady goings-on after another. Kate keeps asking questions of Matt, and Matt keeps avoiding them, often with a knowing smile, the meaning of which he keeps to himself. Brolin is scary in his calmness, especially when his Matt is making up his own rules as he goes along. Del Toro is scary in his actions; his Alejandro is no doubt the most dangerous character in the film. Blunt doesnt make for a great protagonist, since she spends most of the film mostly silent, wearing a look of worry on her face. Thats a problem, but the film is stronger than her performance. Page 2 of 2 - Sicario, the Spanish word for hitman, is definitely about the drug wars and the good guys who are trying to stop the bad guys, but the lines between good and bad sometimes get very fuzzy. Kate, without a doubt one of the good guys, ends up seeing things that she wasnt supposed to see, committed in the name of justice, whatever that word means in the hellhole where the film takes place. One of the most remarkable things about the script is that near the end, her character is kind of relegated to the background, while the background character of Alejandro steps right into the center of the story. But knowing this information, by reading it here before watching the film, you still wont see that coming.
