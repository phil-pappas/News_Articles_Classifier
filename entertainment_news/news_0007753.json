Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.\nThe actor's two-day Cyprus trip is his first since being appointed U.N. Global Advocate for the Elimination of Mines and Explosive Hazards.\n\"I've much hope that I will be the first and last global advocate to see land mines on this beautiful island,\" said Craig.\nTalks aimed at reunifying Cyprus as a federation are expected to ramp up next month as the two sides tackle the issues that still separate them.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
