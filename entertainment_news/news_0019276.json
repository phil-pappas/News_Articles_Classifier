A few days after singing it live for the first time at her solo concert in New York, the No Doubt lead singer releases an accompanying video featuring her in front of camera getting misty eyes as her breakup song plays. Gwen premiered the song at Manhattan Center's Hammerstein last weekend. \"I just want to share a song that I wrote recently,\" she said back then. \"This song is really special. I think this is gonna be the new single.\" Many believes that her split from husband Gavin Rossdale inspired the emotional ballad . \nMy video for #UsedToLoveYou Posted by Gwen Stefani on Tuesday, October 20, 2015 The breakup lyrics include, \"I don't know why I cry / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I used to love you / I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you / I guess nobody taught you how to love.\" Details of her new album are still scarce. She recently collaborated with Pharrell Williams but she decided to scrap the project because \"It didn't feel right.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:15.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
