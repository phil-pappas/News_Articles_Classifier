So Michael Chugg, who was the promoter, actually had to clandestinely fly in from overseas these goddamn limes for Fleetwood Mac’s gin and tonics.” \nAfter writing two books, The Promoters: Inside stories from the Australian rock industry and the recently released Gudinski: The Godfather of Australian Rock , Coupe has plenty of other amazing tales from his life in music. \nHere are some of his favourites which he shared with news.com.au: \nHow Molly Meldrum ruined Elton John’s party: \n“It was back in the 1980s and as was fairly common in those days, major record labels seemed to have a thing for boat cruises,” said Coupe. \n“They would take the artist and the management and a bunch of media and key record label staff out on harbour cruises which were incredibly tedious, because if it wasn’t fun you couldn’t get off for hours. \n“In this particular instance with Elton John, Molly Meldrum was running late. The boat had left and was somewhere out on Sydney Harbour. Molly, without thinking about the implications of what he was about to do, thought that the best way for him to join Elton on the boat was to get the water police to help take him out to the boat where he would jump on board.” \nIt sounds like a good plan right? But it actually resulted in Molly being the most unpopular person at the party when he arrived. \n“Molly was blissfully unaware that everybody on board that boat, who may or may not have been hoovering huge amounts of cocaine and other drugs, saw the police boat heading towards them at a rapid rate and immediately got rid of the pharmaceuticals they had, either by flushing them down the loo or throwing it overboard,” said Coupe. \n“When Molly climbed aboard he was somewhat surprised that he wasn’t greeted with a warm hug, because it was obviously going to be a fairly dull next few hours on the harbour.” Elton John and Molly Meldrum catch up on Countdown in 1984.

It’s understood by promoters right around the world that you don’t tour the Stones so you can buy a new house or car. You’re doing it for the prestige. \n“Michael Gudinski, who toured the Rolling Stones in 2014, once said to me, ‘With the Stones you never assume that you will make money. All you try to do is minimise how much you will lose.’ \n“Having said that, Michael Gudinski does insist that Frontier didn’t lose money on the Stones’ 2014 tour. Someone claimed to me, and I’m not sure if it’s true, but they claim to know that Frontier did make a profit ... of seven cents.” \nThe man who took on The Rolling Stones and won: \n“There’s no guide book that explains what to do next when you’re touring the biggest band on the planet, you land them in Perth, then the lead singer’s long term partner commits suicide and the band wants to leave the country and you’re risking $52 million,” said Coupe. \nBut that’s exactly what happened to Michael Gudinski when he was promoting the Rolling Stones’ Australian tour in 2014. \nWhat happened on that particular morning in March is considered by Coupe to be one of the most impressive deals ever struck by a music promoter. \n“At 3am Perth time, Gudinski gets a tip-off that without consulting him, the Rolling Stones are 15 minutes away from issuing a press release announcing that their Australian tour is cancelled. \n“Gudinski has always believed that if a tour is cancelled, it never comes back on, so he wanted the band to announce a postponement instead that would have given him time to renegotiate with Stones management. \n“He gets on the phone at 3am and speaks to the global tour promoter and argues his case so ferociously that this guy in the US is so convinced that he agrees to phone London to talk to the woman who is the effectively the manager for the Rolling Stones. \n”Basically Gudinski was so persuasive in his argument that the UK based manager was also convinced that they shouldn’t cancel the tour, so with probably 10 minutes to spare in the middle of the night, Gudinski managed to convince the Rolling Stones to announce a postponement of their tour instead, which they did at 5.30am that morning. \n“It allowed Gudinski to restructure the tour and subsequently bring the Stones back later that year. \n“That’s an unbelievably audacious, brilliant stroke of sheer bravado to go up against the Stones in the middle of the night and go, ‘No, you’re not going to cancel.’” Author Stuart Coupe with his latest book.

Someone said, ‘Why do you need a joint Chuggy?’ And he said, ‘The fat c*nt won’t come on until he has a joint.’” \nFor more entertaining stories like these, check out Stuart Coupe’s books which are available from his website, Laughing Outlaw Records .
