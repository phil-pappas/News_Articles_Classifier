But the pop star explained to Refinery 29 that the sexy snaps she took for her album are all part of her journey into adulthood.\n“It's not something where I'm like, let me glorify what I do in the bedroom. But I think I have a very healthy perspective on my sexuality,” Gomez told Refinery . “It's part of being an adult, and I'm still figuring out how to be one of those, too.”\nThough like Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato, Gomez is a Disney alum, she insisted the famous child-stars-turned-pop-stars are all very different.\n“Everyone has found their identity in a really interesting way,” she said of Lovato and Cyrus. “We didn't come out as these robots that looked and dressed the same. We had to go through our own shit. At the end of the day, it’s respecting every female artist’s choice in how she expresses herself, because that’s what she wants.”\nGomez also spoke to Refinery 29 about another famous face—Justin Bieber.\nThe singer admitted she had a rough breakup with The Biebs, but it wasn’t as bad as the media made it out to be.\n“Of course I got my heart broken,” she dished. “Of course I was pissed about it.”\nBut she insisted, “At this point, there is no anger. There's closure in a very good, healthy way. We’ve seen each other. I'm always encouraging and I am proud of his journey. I think people are making it out to be something that is more tragic than it really was. We grew up together. We both made mistakes. That's it.”\nStill, Gomez is happily living the single life right now and does not want a relationship.\nShe warned, “Do not try to date me right now.”\nClick here to read Selena's entire interview from Refinery 29", "external_links": ["http://www.refinery29.com/2015/10/94843/selena-gomez-revival-growing-up-relationships-interview?utm_campaign=press"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:32:26.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
