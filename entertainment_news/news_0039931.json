Amorosi, For The Inquirer Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015, 3:01 AM \nWith 2014's Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone , tousle-haired Lucinda Williams put her roots country-rocking money where her mouth has long been and released an album on a label of her own, Highway 20 Records. Her robust lyricism, blunt musicality and distinctly rusty vocal tones have put her in a league of her own since 1979's Ramblin' on My Mind . Frankly, Williams never did sound like any other alterna-country presence, a fact she proved once more on Tuesday night at Theatre of Living Arts. \nSure, Williams got to the gig late, and seemed frazzled - even weirdly laconic - at show's start. Buick 6 (consisting of drummer Butch Norton, bassist David Sutton, guitarist Stuart Mathis) acted as both opener and backing band, and were left to do the heavy lifting. While the trio did their hillbilly psychedelic thing (think the Doors meets the Buckaroos), Williams lazily but grittily intoned the bluesy guitar paean \"Drunken Angel\" (\"Could've held on to that long smooth neck/Let your hand remember every fret\") and the willowy fish-out-of-water tanked \"Can't Let Go.\" \nGetting a groove seemed difficult for Williams until she hit upon the passive-aggressive romancer \"Those Three Days.\" Her trembling vocals were an apt match for Mathis' vibrato. Slowly, she got her snotty swagger back with the mad bad portrait of injustice \"West Memphis,\" filled with her drummer's bass-y vocal backgrounds and a snake charmer's lilt. Confidently, Williams dropped new songs like the Spanish acoustic guitar-accented \"The Ghosts of Highway 20\" with an ache in her tortured voice and secrets of her youth in its weary lyrics. With that, the lonesome lovely \"Dust,\" with lyrics adapted from her father's poem of the same name, was filled with men who couldn't cry, weighty tom-tom rhythms, a wiggly psychedelic vibe and William's clearest vocal of the evening. From there, the spooky, sleigh bell-filled \"Are You Down?\" with its snarling \"Can't force the river upstream\" chorus. The Patti Smith-punkish \"Foolishness\" and \"Protection\" proved the show's first half was an anomaly. Williams ruled and rocked, as usual. When Williams and Co. came close to closing out the night with the jamming \"Essence\" and the words \"Baby, sweet baby, kiss me hard/Make me wonder who's in charge,\" you truly knew just who was in control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:57:58.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
