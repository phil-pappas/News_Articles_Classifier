This is great. I bet a lot of people think this is great.\nMaybe the theme of all this is \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it, just take it to the beach. And then don't go to bed. Oh yeah, and boobs.\" Or something.\nBefore you watch, keep an eye out for these key moments:\n- A random bomb going off on the beach. Why? Don't know.\n- The lead singer bringing a drowning victim back to life by singing in her face.\n- Weird crotch thrusts.\n- David Hasselhoff is still wearing his Baywatch outfit. Why? And why is he wearing it while just sitting in his house watching TV?", "external_links": ["http://www.simpleplan.com/spbed?ref=https://www.google.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9ovl3ixqHs"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:13:14.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
