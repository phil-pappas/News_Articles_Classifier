Lance has said that he, “...started writing poetry as a stress reliever and the poems started receiving good responses so I decided to get them published.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Lance Figgins’s poignant compilation came from a particularly stressful year.\nWhile dealing with a divorce from a marriage of 22 years, Lance suffered a heart attack, the engine in his truck suffered catastrophic failure, and his girl could not handle the distance his choice of employment caused them.\nLance found a certain peace and solace in writing and after receiving positive feedback on his work, he decided to publish this anthology.\nReaders who wish to experience this genuine and profound work can purchase “Poetic Trucker: Broken Dreams” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
