The Roots ' Questlove and Captain Kirk Douglas reprised their roles as members of the duo when they performed a cover of The Weeknd 's \"Can't Feel My Face\". Black Simon and Garfunkel have been putting their spin on popular songs for Jimmy Fallon 's late-night shows for years, but they made their latest performance more special by bringing out the real Art Garfunkel during the song. The 73-year-old musician entered the stage right before they tackled the chorus. The trio then continued singing The Weeknd's hit single and closed out the rendition with a little bit of the real Simon & Garfunkel 's \"The Boxer\". Garfunkel's appearance on \"Tonight Show\" came less than a month after his former partner Paul Simon joined a Paul Simon tribute band called Troubled Waters during an episode of \" The Late Show with Stephen Colbert \". Simon played \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" alongside his new bandmates at that time. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Art Garfunkel News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:32:41.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
