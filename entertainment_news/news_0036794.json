Why Channel 7’s 800 Words has beaten the odds to become one of 2016’s biggest ratings successes October 13, 2015 8:50am Image 800 Words: sneak peek 1:20 \nWhen his wife dies suddenly, George (Erik Thomson) makes a rash decision to move his two teenaged kids away from the big smoke of Sydney to the picturesque town of Weld in New Zealand. Coming soon to Seven. June 19th 2015 Actor Sigrid Thornton with William McInnes in scene from TV program \"SeaChange\". Colin Vickery News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nWHY has 800 Words succeeded where so many other Australian shows have failed? That is the question many people are asking after the runaway success of Channel 7’s new drama. \nThe show is averaging a whopping 1.4 million-plus across the five capital cities once catch-up viewing is added. It is consistently Tuesday night’s number one program and, even more remarkably, usually builds its audience on lead-in show The X Factor. \n800 Words has received generally favourable reviews and there is no denying the quality of the writing as well as the performances from Erik Thomson as George Turner as well as Melinda Vidler as daughter Shay and Benson Jack Anthony as son Arlo. \nBut there is more to it than that. Here are my five reasons that 800 Words has struck such a chord with Aussie audiences. Cast from Channel Seven (7) TV show 'Packed To The Rafters'. Source: Supplied \n1. The Packed to the Rafters Halo Effect \nPacked to the Rafters is the biggest Aussie TV drama of the last decade and it was still rating strongly when Channel 7 ceased production in 2013 after six seasons. The big question was whether Erik Thomson and Rebecca Gibney could have the same level of success separately as they had teamed as Dave and Julie Rafter. The answer is a resounding ‘yes’. Gibney’s Winter rated strongly earlier this year, particularly once catch-up figures were added in, grabbing well over 1 million viewers across the five capital cities. Now Thomson’s 800 Words has done even better. Former Packed to the Rafters star Jessica Marais’ Love Child is a smash for Nine too. Rafters fans have flocked to all three new shows.

Instead, program chief Angus Ross decided to be patient. If 800 Words had been programmed at the start of the year with My Kitchen Rules it likely wouldn’t have aired until 9pm or after — too late for its family audience. Pairing it with ratings dud Restaurant Revolution in the middle of the year would have been disastrous. Teaming it with The X Factor on Tuesday nights is perfect. It gets an 8.40pm start and is a natural destination for the families already watching Seven’s talent show. “With 800 words we have always known the slot we wanted it to go in and it is a slot that became available in September”, Ross says.

George Turner shares a lot of similarities with Dave Rafter \nErik Thomson may not like to admit it but if Dave Rafter had to deal with the death of wife Julie, he’d pretty much turn into George Turner. Both are TV dads trying to do their best to navigate the ups and downs of modern life and provide guidance and support to their kids. Thomson has already said that, for him, 800 Words is “not Rafters 2.0”, pointing out that George is a writer and Dave a tradie and George a widower with Dave happily married. George’s kids are also slightly younger than Dave’s. But, to me, they’re small differences compared to the overriding similarities. Erik Thomson makes both characters wholly believable.

Viewers shunned Nine’s Gallipoli which is one of 2015’s biggest ratings disappointments. Instead, people want lighter, more life affirming shows and 800 Words fits the bill. The remote New Zealand seaside town of Weld that George moves to is filled with the sort of eccentric characters we’ve seen in former Aussie hits SeaChange and Always Greener. Offspring is another obvious touchstone with its mix of wry humour and fantasy sequences. George’s recent dating dilemmas are straight out of the Nina Proudman handbook. And let’s not forget Packed to the Rafters which also had plenty of heart and the same intergenerational byplay. Even in a story that centres on grief, there is a lightness of touch. 800 Words never gets too dark. “If you think this show (800 Words) has a bit of the same feel and vibe as Packed to the Rafters, you’re dead right — and we make no apologies for that,” Ross has said.

Source: AFP \n5. 800 Words taps in to our escapist fantasies \nWhat Aussie hasn’t dreamt of giving up hectic city living for more relaxed time by the sea. It will be a fresh start and every day will be a summer holiday. It is the escapist fantasy that sees people more and more people move from down south to Queensland or Byron Bay every year. That fantasy has also fuelled dramas such as SeaChange as well as real estate shows like Relocation, Relocation. 800 Words centres on the same dream with George’s move from Sydney to Weld. Not everything goes according to plan — a container is lost at sea, the new house is a dump — but harried viewers can still bask in the stunning New Zealand coastal scenery and envision their own seaside escape.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:11:48.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
