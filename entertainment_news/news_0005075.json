Or so it would seem in cemeteries throughout the area as grave markers fade, tip or sink, the years wearing them down.\nSuch is the case in St. Mary’s Cemetery in Geneseo, which is around the corner from where I live.\nThe cemetery is very well-maintained, but some of the stones are showing their age.\nBecky Lawrence, who manages the cemetery, and her husband, Brian, have a particular concern for the 22 graves of Civil War veterans. They are scattered throughout the cemetery, generally tucked into family plots.\nThe Lawrences have identified seven of these graves whose markers need work. The top of one is all that peeks out of the ground. Others are tilting or their inscriptions are faded.\nThe couple became interested in restoring the stones after someone reminded them that this year marks the 150th anniversary of the end of the War Between the States.\n“That really hit us,” Brian says. “We said, ‘We’ve got to do something.’”\nAnd so, they’re having a fundraising dinner Saturday. Their modest goal is to come up with the $1,300 necessary to restore the markers most in need of repair.\nIn working on this project, the Lawrences have come to know the veterans’ backstories. Indeed, it’s almost as if they and the long-gone have become friends.\n“This is Martin Graham,” Becky says, introducing a stone and, by implication, a person. And over there is John O’Connor, who enlisted in the 12th New York Cavalry at age 14 and survived the war without injury. (One of his brothers, however, was killed.)\nO’Connor’s great-granddaughter, Nancy Monahan of East Rochester, wrote Brian, filling in some of the other details of her ancestor, how he moved to Geneseo from Le Roy in the 1870s, operated a restaurant, owned property.\nNot as much is known about some of the other Civil War veterans.\n“That’s no reason to neglect them,” Brian says. “We need to preserve their history. If their monuments (disappear), no one will ever know they’re here.”\nPaint removal\nIn Rochester’s Mt. Hope Cemetery, a Civil War-related preservation effort of another sort is underway.\nArchitectural conservators Ron Koenig of Michigan and Peter Ellison of Canandaigua have been working this week on bringing back to life an impressive statue that graces a section of the cemetery holding the graves of about 400 veterans of the Civil War.\nThe Civil War monument at Mt. Hope Cemetery is currently being restored. (Photo: JIM MEMMOTT)\nSally James Farnham created the statue in 1908. It shows a flag-bearing soldier, his head bowed, standing beside a bugler. They seem spent, exhausted after a long war, as they honor the dead who lie all around.\nFarnham was a native of Ogdensburg, St. Lawrence County, and a friend and protégé of Frederic Remington. She also sculpted a Civil War monument for Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Rochester.\nAs much as they can, Koenig and Ellison hope to return the sculpture to its original appearance by removing the coat of paint that had been applied to the statue at some time after its creation.\nThe project is being financed in part by a grant from the Rochester Area Community Foundation obtained by the Friends of Mt. Hope Cemetery. (The Friends sponsor tours of the cemetery throughout the year. Coming up on Saturday and next Tuesday, there will be torch-lit nighttime tours.)\nOn Monday, the statue restorers were conducting a test of sorts, removing the paint from a bronze dog that had the name Carlo Pratt on its collar. “Carlo,” as the restorers have come to refer to the dog, was once taken from the cemetery and then found in a field in Henrietta.\nThe statue restoration effort should be finished this week.\nOn Remarkable Rochester\nRetired Senior Editor Jim Memmott reflects on what makes Rochester distinctively Rochester, its history, its habits, its people.
