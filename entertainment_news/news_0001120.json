The director was overwhelmed by the response he got for the film.\n\"Italian audience have been very generous to me and my movies, I have a special connection with this country as I often choose to come and write here. So tonight's reaction reconfirms how universal 'AIG' is! It seems all women are connecting to 'AIG' almost all over the world,\" Nalin said in a statement,\nThe cast of â€œ'Angry Indian Goddesses' includes Sandhya Mridul, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Anushka Manchanda, Amrit Maghera, Rajshri Deshpande and Pavleen Gujral.\n'Angry Indian Goddesses' follows the stories of seven girls. It narrates the tale of how Frieda, essayed by actress Sarah-Jane Dias, invites her closest girlfriends to Goa to announce her wedding, and it all turns into a wild bachelorette party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:44:15.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
