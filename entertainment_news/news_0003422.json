Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley, was shocked that Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, pulled out of the race for House speaker Thursday, Oct. 8.\n“I don’t think anyone in the (Republican) caucus knew he was going to do that,” Cook said by phone Thursday morning. “Everyone was talking about the numbers game and how many votes you’re going to need.”\nMcCarthy, Cook said, gave a speech that stressed how Republicans needed to come together. The divided nature of the House Republican majority became even more evident following the abrupt resignation late last month of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n“In his mind, he thought it was the right decision and I respect him for doing that,” Cook said of McCarthy. “I’m just disappointed that right now we’re going into this, and it’s so chaotic.”\nMcCarthy’s statements about the Benghazi investigation harming Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers “hurt him quite a bit,” Cook said. “You’ve got to be very careful with what you say or what you write.”\nLike Cook, Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Corona, had backed McCarthy’s bid for speaker.\n“Kevin is a close friend; I supported his bid and thought he would make an excellent speaker, his decision was based on what he thought was best for the conference and the country,” Calvert said in an emailed statement.\nAt least one Inland Democrat didn’t show much sympathy for House Republicans. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Riverside, posted a mock Craigslist ad for speaker on his Twitter and Facebook account.\n“Are you an American citizen? Do you have experience negotiating hostage situations? Are you ready for the challenge of a lifetime? Then this job is for you!” the ad read.\nResponsibilities for the job, according to the ad, include: “Maintaining women’s access to health care,” “Managing multiple investigative committees aimed at attacking Hillary Clinton” and “Explaining to the ‘Freedom Caucus’ the concepts of compromise and democratic governance.”\n“Babysitting experience STRONGLY PREFERRED,” Takano’s ad read.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxbqo-b88535185z.120151008155436000g7ncfpf2.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxbqo-b88535185z.120151008155436000g7ncfpe3.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxbqo-b88535185z.120151008155436000g7ncfpf2.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxbqo-b88535185z.120151008155436000g7ncfpe3.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:05:33.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
