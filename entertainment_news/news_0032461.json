In a picture that is being shared on social media, you can see members of the two teams kneeling together. \n\"It was very touching, knowing what happened,\" said Memorial High booster president, Merritt Chastain. \nThe goodwill didn't stop there. Memorial High parents set up a GoFundMe account for the injured Aldine player. So far, they've raised more than $7,000. \nWhen the varsity teams played Saturday night, Memorial High players put blue stickers on their helmets to show support. Blue is Aldine High School's color. \n\"It shows support of a fellow athlete,\" said Richard Delgado, Aldine's athletic director. \"It's a lot of what we should be doing in society, supporting one another.\" \nIt's not clear what caused Ortiz to collapse. Privacy rules prevent school officials from commenting on a student's health information. He is said to be doing better, and is now alert and talking.
