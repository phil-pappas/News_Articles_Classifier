The industry will likely face aggressive competition from other leisure activities, threatening future growth. Nonetheless, as consumers release pent-up demand from the recession, industry operators are primed for increased revenue growth which will peak in 2019.Industry activity is concentrated in two of the most populous regions of the United States: the Southeast, Great Lakes and West regions.\"\n“For professional anglers and even those who simply desire to catch a fish or two while camping, a boat is an essential vehicle while above water,” says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing Review. “However, many boat designs have limited movement and more often than not, its engine can get quite noisy. The Skip Drive is a boating invention which provides an improved propulsion system which enables a smoother and more quiet ride.”\nThe Skip Drive is a boating invention that improves the way a boat moves above water. It makes use of a propeller-free system that makes it a whole lot easy and convenient to tread to a wide variety of waterways and can make gliding on shallow water stress-free. It is further designed with propulsion treads that are situated along the entire length of the boat, thus simulating the functions of a 4-wheel drive land vehicle. What this does is allow the boat to be unloaded or loaded in an efficient and speedier manner.\n“The Skip Drive will definitely provide a more efficient way of boating,” says inventor Richard M. “Most boats are usually fitted with noisy engines. And in addition to this, these engine and boat designs allow only limited movement. This boating invention has unique design features which will ultimately provide a new and improved boat design.”\nAllan Williams, an avid fan of outdoor activities from Aspen, CO, has this to say about the Skip Drive: “When it comes to fishing, one of the most annoying things to experience is scaring away all the fishes with all the noise that comes from the boat’s engine. With the Skip Drive, I can now tread through water in a significantly quiet and efficient manner.”\nThe Skip Drive is a boating invention that will make boating more enjoyable and hassle-free for enthusiasts.\nABOUT WORLD PATENT MARKETING\nWorld Patent Marketing is an innovation incubator and manufacturer of patented products for inventors and entrepreneurs.
