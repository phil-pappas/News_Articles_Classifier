Director Steven Spielberg puts on a filmmaking clinic as we watch Abel, sitting amid Cold War-era radio equipment, preparing to leave an apartment, tinkering with various objects and art supplies. \nJust as the movie is about a bygone era of spying and diplomacy, this scene is from a bygone era of filmmaking, when Spielberg was first coming up with kids named De Palma, Scorsese and Coppola. There’s no dialogue, just the moving images and sounds of a man preparing, with great care, to run a very complex errand. \nEvery movement tells a story. Every frame has a reason. It’s Spielberg, teaming up with the brilliant Mark Rylance as Abel for a scene that should be shown in every film school on the planet for the rest of time. It’s a scene that makes you believe you’re about to see something brilliant, maybe even classic. \nUnfortunately, that’s just not the case, although Bridge of Spies certainly isn’t a bad film. It’s anything but. \nTom Hanks plays James B. Donovan, a successful insurance attorney in Brooklyn, New York who’s asked by his firm’s partners to represent Abel. At first reluctant, given the national ill will toward his prospective client, Donovan decides Abel has the right to legal representation. The CIA and the even the judge presiding over the case urge Donovan to stand down in his vigorous defense of Abel, but Donovan feels a moral and ethical obligation to defend him. \nIn the meantime, the U.S. is doing its own spying on Russia, via U2 spy planes that fly at 70,000 feet. If the plane goes down, the pilots are instructed to blow up the plane by flipping a switch and, should they survive behind enemy lines, to poison themselves. When the U2 flown by pilot Frances Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is hit by a missile, he’s unable to reach the switch to blow up the plane, and gets knocked unconscious before he can poison himself. He winds up captured by the Soviet Union. \nThis is when both governments decide a prisoner swap is in order. But the U.S. government doesn’t want to be officially involved, so they ask Donovan to go to Germany and broker the trade. \nAgain, Spielberg’s recreation of the period, particularly East Berlin and the Berlin Wall, is terrific. At the same time, the story feels disconnected from the natural tension of Donovan’s business there. The script by Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen, while filled with some memorable dialogue, is a little busy telling us there’s tension, but not busy enough showing us. \nAlso at play is an American economics student named Frederic Pryor whom the East Germans captured and are using as a bargaining chip to curry favor with the Russians. Donovan, much to the chagrin of the CIA, decides he also wants to win Pryor’s release. It’s a story line that meanders and doesn’t feel consistent with the rest of the film. \nBridge of Spies is a well-acted, technically sound movie based on an incredible and historically important story, and yet it feels a bit too long and doesn’t have quite the emotional payoff it should. Still, there are plenty of compelling and satisfying moments to keep your interest, and then some. \nFour out of five stars. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
