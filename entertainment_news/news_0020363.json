Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 4:00 am Bishop Zubik visits Mooncrest, where Felician Sisters work to make a difference By Tom Davidson tdavidson@timesonline.com Timesonline.com | 0 comments \nMOON TWP. -- Pittsburgh Bishop David A. Zubik was given a pope's welcome to mark his first visit to Mooncrest to see the good works being done there by a small group of Felician Sisters. \nA message on an electronic traffic sign welcomed Zubik to the historic development in Moon Township that was built as housing for defense workers during World War II. \nCamera shutters clicked and people used smartphones to take pictures of Zubik as he walked up Hemlock Drive from the convent where three nuns live, to the Mooncrest Community Center, where they perform the bulk of their ministry. \nZubik personally greeted everyone who came out to mark his visit. \n\"A place like this is so bright,\" Zubik said of the community center. \nIt's a place that's filled with photographs of smiling youngsters and their artwork. On Thursday, the children filled the center to meet and greet the bishop, and he was all smiles as he talked and joked with them and listened to their music. \n\"It's a beautiful, beautiful sign of God's love,\" Zubik said. \nIn recent decades, the neighborhood's been plagued by drugs, crime and poverty. Since 2002, the community's been helped by the small group of Felician Sisters who live in and work to improve Mooncrest. \nSisters Rene Procopio, Thaddea Myers and Clarence Borkoski have made it their mission to work to improve the community and especially to help the children who live in it. \n\"We're trying to just make a difference,\" Procopio said. \nThey bought and renovated one of the houses on Hemlock Drive to serve as a convent and are located in the thick of the worst of Mooncrest life. \n\"We're trying to make a statement,\" she said. \"We're right in the middle of the drug dealing.\" \nWhen they came to Mooncrest in 2002, they worked with a Baptist church to start an afterschool program. It began with six youngsters, but grew to 13 after a year, Procopio remembered. Then it was 26. Then 35. \nNow, about 60 of the 150 children in the neighborhood participate in a variety of programs at the community center. \nThe nuns have the support of Moon officials, the Moon Area School District and Robert Morris University, Procopio said. \nThey'll partner with anyone who wants to lend a helping hand as they work to secure grants and donations to cover the $300,000 annual cost of running things. \nThey're a part of the neighborhood \"to be a presence,\" Myers said. And it's a presence that makes a \"big difference,\" Procopio said. \nThey invited Zubik, who was educated by Felician Sisters during his Catholic school days while growing up across the Ohio River in Ambridge, to visit Mooncrest to give him an idea of what they do, she said. \nZubik was visibly impressed. \"As religious women, they have committed a lot of energy to reach out to people in need,\" he said. \nThe children who participate in the neighborhood center's activities presented Zubik with gifts and performed songs for him. \n\"You've put a smile on my face that's going to be with me the rest of the day,\" he told the youths. \"Thank you for the present you are.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:57:59.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
