In his mind, Henryâ€™s also turning over the fact, hidden to some more than others, of his homosexuality. A roving North Shore pack of characters crowds the writer-director Stephen Cone's trim 86-minute narrative, which might've profited from a little more time and breathing room. But the visual fluidity of the filmmaking marks a step forward for Cone, whose earlier work includes \"Black Box\" and \"The Wise Kids.\" Laidlaw and Doman are particularly strong. \n8 p.m. Friday (repeats 11:30 a.m. Saturday), AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Tickets $11-$14 at chicagofilmfestival.com . Running time: 1:26. \n-Michael Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:41:07.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
