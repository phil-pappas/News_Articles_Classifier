One day after a 6-year-old Chicago boy accidentally shot and killed his little brother with their father’s gun, a judge set the man’s bail at $1 million — an amount that made him cry in the courtroom as his family members gasped.\nBut the judge quickly reduced Michael Santiago's bail to $75,000 — after his public defender argued Santiago had suffered enough and needed to be there for his family, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n“This is the ultimate tragedy,” Cook County Circuit Court Judge James Brown told Santiago.\n“And whether I said a $1 million bond or a lower bond, it's not going to bring back this child... I'm sure the defendant did not intend for this to happen, but it happened. And it's what happens when people have guns who shouldn't have guns.”\nSantiago, 25, was charged with child endangerment after his older son shot his brother Eian, 3, in the face while they played cops and robbers Saturday night.\nFamily friend George Rayyan told the Daily News Santiago kept his.32-caliber revolver bundled in a pair of pajama pants on top of a refrigerator, thinking it was too tall for his children to scale.\nBut his boys still knew about the weapon, and Santiago warned them it could be handled “only by adults,” prosecutors said.\nHis wife, Angie Lasalle, was watching the boys with her father and stepped out for a few minutes with her daughter when the shooting happened, Rayyan said.\nChris Sweda/ZUMAPRESS.com A family member breaks down outside a hospital after the shooting. The grandfather, Hector Salgado, told the Tribune the older boy “doesn’t even remember” the shooting.\n“He doesn’t know anything about it,” he said. “He thinks his brother is in the hospital sick.”\nThe agonized father told police he is a former member of the Spanish Cobras gang, and bought the gun from a fellow ex-member because he felt he needed protection after snitching on a thug.\nPolice are still tracing the weapon, but said Santiago does not have a concealed carry license or a firearm owner’s identification card, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.\nSantiago was convicted of misdemeanor theft and disorderly conduct in 2010, but has no felony convictions, according to the Sun-Times.\nIn court, he wore a t-shirt for the restaurant he manages, Papa Ray’s Pizza, where he was working when he got the call about his sons. Family members said they could only contribute $1,000 to his bail.\njsilverstein@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories De Blasio eyes way to replace NYC’s cash-based bail system New York judge introduces bail review for defendants", "external_links": ["http://chicago.suntimes.com/news-chicago/7/71/1026898/michael-santiago-son-shoots-brother", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-man-held-on-75k-bail-after-son-6-fatally-shoots-brother-3-20151018-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:14:36.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
