Prime Minister Narendra Modi has greeted the nation on the festive occasion through his official Twitter handle. Modi chose to tweet purely in Hindi – the national language of India – this time. He said, “नवरात्रि के पावन पर्व पर सभी देशवासियों को हार्दिक शुभकामनायें।” \nThe Prime Minister also shared a picture of Goddess Durga, in whose name the festival is celebrated, and her nine forms. नवरात्रि के पावन पर्व पर सभी देशवासियों को हार्दिक शुभकामनायें। pic.twitter.com/it0kMkPCYR \n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 13, 2015 \nNavratri or the nine nights of Durga Puja is an auspicious occasion that leads up to the auspicious day of Vijayadashmi or Dussehra. The festival marks the victory of good over evil. For nine days, prayers are offered to the goddess and fast observed. \nPeople also participate in Dandiya dancing nights, especially the Gujaratis. Our PM belongs to the same community and we are sure Navratri holds special importance in his life. Here’s wishing Narendra Modi and the entire country a very happy Navratri 2015! Pray to the goddess and have loads of fun. \n  8:40 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:52:27.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
