Food enzymes are a major food additives which convert complex molecules in to simpler ones in our diet. The food enzymes market was valued is expected to reach US$ 2695 million by 2020, with a CAGR of 8.1% for the forecast period of 2015-2020. Food enzymes are sourced from micro-organisms and new technologies are emerging to produce genetically modified organisms strains. The enzymes thus produced are anticipated to perform in adverse operational conditions, thus improving process efficiency. The demand for processed and packaged foods is growing with the need to provide food security and safety. However, due to complexities in the global food supply chain, there is a need to add food additives to keep intact the nutritional content and maintain the shelf life. Apart from these reasons, the increasing penetration of organized retail in urban and rural centers globally seem to drive the need for food enzymes.
