The Oscar-winning screenwriter spilled, \"Since the very beginning, Laurene Jobs has been trying to kill this movie, OK? Laurene Jobs called Leo DiCaprio and said, 'Don't do it.'

Michael Fassbender eventually lands the coveted role. Seth Rogen plays Steve Wozniak, another Apple co-founder. Kate Winslet also joins the cast. Fassbender said, \"I was nervous. I was very nervous.

She described the nature of the film and how it's constructed in three acts. And I finally said, 'What's the girl's part?' \" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Steve Jobs News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:08.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
