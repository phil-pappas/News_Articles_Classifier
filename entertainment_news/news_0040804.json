That singer Johnny Cash married his San Antonio sweetheart — the woman for whom he would later write “I Walk the Line” — at St. Ann Catholic Church here? That the popular food snack we all know as Fritos was first crunched here? That San Antonio can be called the birthplace of barbed wire? That Texas’ first museum of modern art was formed here by a patron and collector named Marion Koogler McNay?\nOn Sept. 27, 1865, the San Antonio Express (later the Express-News) began bearing witness to the growth and transformation of the city.\nMore Information San Antonio: Our Story of 150 Years in the Alamo City\nBy San Antonio Express-News staff\nTrinity University Press, $39.95\nAvailable in the Express-News lobby, 301 Ave. E, at Barnes & Noble bookstores, at The Twig Book Shop at The Pearl, 306 Pearl Parkway, and online at mySA.com/shop, Amazon.com, and BarnesandNoble.com.\nSan Antonio’s rich history is well-documented in a new 517-page, lavishly illustrated, coffee-table book titled “San Antonio: Our Story of 150 Years in the Alamo City,” written and compiled by the staff of the Express-News to commemorate the newspaper’s 150th anniversary.\nThe book will be featured at the Express-News Book & Author Luncheon Nov. 5 at the Marriott Rivercenter Hotel.\nPublished by hometown Trinity University Press, “Our Story” is a compilation of daily stories by Express-News reporters, photographers and editors that began Jan. 25 and concluded Sept. 26.\n“The observance of our 150th anniversary gave the staff a unique opportunity to examine what makes San Antonio so special, with fresh reporting, modern scholarship and a perspective that views the growth of America from south to north, west to east,” said Express-News Editor Mike Leary. “This is, after all, one of the founding cities of America, like Philadelphia or Boston, but one that is culturally quite different. Just think - when the Erie Canal opened up the American West to settlement, San Antonio was already a significant western city, more than 100 years old.”\nWith 250 stories, the book is divided into categories ranging from business to culture to health and education, illustrated with historical photographs and new images.\nThe overriding impact of “Our Story” is the determination of the people — from the Canary Islanders who first settled here in the 1700s to ’30s labor leader Emma Tenayuca to former Mayor Henry Cisneros — who built and formed San Antonio into the dynamic, unique city that it is today.\nTom Payton, associate director of Trinity University Press, calls “Our Story” “a major event for San Antonio.”\n“While there are many wonderful yet narrowly defined books about the history of our city,” there is not a book that alone attempts to portray its large and diverse cultural arc, spanning almost three centuries — a multifaceted story that is very unique within the American experience. The staff of the Express News has done a stunning job of capturing so many stories, voices and perspectives on our shared history.”\nsbennett@express-news.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:40:09.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
