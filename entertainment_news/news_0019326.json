Think challah, tsoureki, soda bread, pita and naan. \nIn Quaker Hill, where a contingent of Polish families relocated their church from New London in the early 1970s — think babka. \nFor 50 years, members of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church have been baking Polish sweet bread to sell at their annual fall festival. \nThis year’s annual Christmas Fair and Bake Sale is Saturday at the church in the Quaker Hill section of Waterford. And among the tag sale items, crafts, kielbasa and sauerkraut, will be about 500 loaves of Polish sweet bread — 250 with raisins and 250 with cinnamon. \nSister Mary Michelle Sokol, director of religious education at the church, will lead dozens of kitchen helpers in a baking marathon the day before the fair. In one day, dozens of eggs, gallons of milk and pounds of sugar and cake yeast will be turned into bread. Volunteers will man their stations in the industrial-sized kitchen at the church as they bake bread in 24-loaf batches — beating three dozen eggs, combining 12 cups of milk and mixing in 24 cups of flour at one time. \n“There are ladies in the hall waiting for the bread to take out of the pans, let them cool and then bag them,” said Sokol, 73, who joined the church in 1980 and immediately began helping with the fall baking tradition. She’s partial to babka. She keeps a loaf in her freezer and breaks it out when her sister comes to visit. The cinnamon bread makes excellent French toast, she said. \n“Dad worked in a bakery all his life,” said Sokol, who grew up in Meriden with a sister and two brothers. “I guess we always had it in us.” \nEvery morning, she said, one of the kids would make a run to the bakery for bread and dessert. She still has a hard time eating “cotton bread,” which is what she calls prepackaged loaves of bread from the grocery store. \nSokol and her volunteers are pretty efficient. They start at 6 a.m. and are done baking by 1 p.m. The final bagging is done by 4 p.m. \nThe bread sells for $7 a loaf and every year it sells out, or leftovers are brought to church services on Sunday and sold to congregants. \nEileen Button, who has been co-chairing the fair with Arlene Margolis for years, said part of the reason the bread sells so well is because it is homemade and unique. \n“It’s made by women who are Polish. I really do think, you can’t find it around here,” she said. \nThe recipe is from the family of the late Rev. Leo S. Sutula, who was pastor at the church from 1964 until 1998, and his sister, Sister Mary Daniel Sutula, who was also assigned to Our Lady of Perpetual Help. \n“Sister Daniel taught us how to make the bread,” Button said, adding that Father Sutula would also be in the kitchen with the ladies helping. \n“We all enjoyed it so much,” she said.
