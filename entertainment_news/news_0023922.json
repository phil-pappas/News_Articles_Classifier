Racing legend Dale Earnhardt Jr. will visit Walmart at 2025 North Marine Blvd. 6:30 to 8:30 Tuesday night with a question-and-answer session open to the public and a meet and greet limited to the first 200 registered, according to information from Minges Bottling Group. Jim Lawrence of Sneads Ferry is more than a mere fan of Number 88, which Earnhardt drives. Just consider Lawrence’s pig cooker — sacred North Carolina equipment once painted like Earnhardt Jr.’s race car. Now, it closely resembles Danica Patrick’s. He also has a room jam-packed with Earnhardt memorabilia. “I have all of his die casts,” Lawrence said. “I have a tire off of one of his cars.” Years ago, Lawrence attended Darlington races. Now, he watches every Sunday race on TV. The chance to meet Earnhardt Jr. would confirm one of Lawrence’s bucket-list accomplishments. “I’m a die-hard fan,” Lawrence said. “I’ve never got to meet him in person.” He met Danica Patrick once, hence the pig cooker’s paint. Walmart at North Marine Boulevard outsold 5,000 other stores nationwide during a promotional campaign for PepsiCo’s Baja Blast and Sangrita Blast over the summer to win the visit, said Miles Minges, the key account manager for Minges Bottling Group. Diet Mountain Dew, also a PepsiCo product, is a sponsor of Earnhardt Jr. “It’s not every day that a racing legend visits in your own backyard and we couldn’t have done it without the support of our loyal customers,” Minges said. The appearance is open to the public. The first 200 people will get to participate and have a photo taken with the driver. Registration for the meet-and-greet, which includes a photo opp, will begin at noon Tuesday at the Walmart. Minges Bottling Group distributes PepsiCo Americas Beverages, including Diet Mountain Dew products. “This relationship has allowed Minges Bottling Group the opportunity to bring one of the most beloved drivers to Eastern North Carolina,” Minges said. Lawrence can’t make it to the meet-and-greet, but he plans to have someone capture a signature while he is working at his Sneads Ferry Truck & Auto on N.C. 172. “I might send something of mine up there with a friend,” Lawrence said. “I don’t close until 5 p.m.” For more information, visit MBGPepsi.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:46:00.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
