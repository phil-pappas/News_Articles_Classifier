He was last seen in the 50th anniversary episode, The Day Of The Doctor in 2013. David Tennant and Catherine Tate by the Tardis (BBC/PA) \nThe Scottish actor’s biggest success outside of Doctor Who is ITV drama Broadchurch, in which he starred as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy alongside Olivia Colman. \nBest known for her range of comic characters, Catherine’s first Doctor Who appearance came in 2006; she left the role in 2010. \nThe duo will record Doctor Who – The Tenth Doctor Adventures for Big Finish, a British company who produce books and audio plays primarily from sci-fi favourites. \nThe series is available to pre-order from October 26. David Tennant and Catherine Tate arrive at Big Finish! #DoctorWho #BFTEN https://t.co/WoPhxxiTsj pic.twitter.com/P6QdH6ht3s \n— Big Finish (@bigfinish) October 26, 2015 \nThe first episode is called Technophobia, set in near-future London. According to the synopsis, mankind is gradually losing its ability to use everyday technology. Promoted stories \nThe second instalment is Time Reaver which is set on a mechanical planet with a black market economy and a dark secret. \nThe final recording will be Death And The Queen and it will see Donna fall in love on a planet called Goritania, but the Doctor has misgivings. \nBig Finish released a promotional clip featuring the star duo paying tribute to each other. \n“I love working with Catherine because of the life that she brings to something and the way that she can turn the most mundane line into something glorious and sparkling,” said David. \nIn return, Catherine responded: “David embodied the part of the Doctor and made it his own. David’s got a mercurial mind and he has that facility as an actor to turn on a penny and he can drew you in, he can pull you, push you away, make you laugh, make you cry – he can do all of those brilliant things.” \nExecutive producer Nicholas Briggs said: “I’ve enjoyed working with all the Doctors on TV, but David is on the only one I’d known before he became the Doctor. I’d worked with him on our Dalek Empire series for Big Finish and had such fun. So along with the excitement of directing new Tenth Doctor adventures, I’m so happy to be working with an old chum again.” \nAccording to figures released by the Press Association, Tennant’s stint as Doctor Who is the most popular with viewers. \nChristmas 2007 special Voyage Of The Damned, which co-starred pop princess Kylie Minogue, was watched by 13.31 million. In second place is 2008 Christmas Special The Next Doctor with 13.10 million viewers. \nThe third most watched so far is the 50th Anniversary Special, The Day Of The Doctor in which Tennant teamed up with 11th Doctor Matt Smith. This episode was seen by 12.80 million. Share article \nDoctor Who – The Tenth Doctor Adventures will be released on the Big Finish website in May 2016.
