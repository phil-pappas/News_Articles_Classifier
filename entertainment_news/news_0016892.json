By Kim Wade Jamie Herbster, age 53, is an upbeat person. She works full-time at the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency in Savannah where she helps people with disabilities prepare for and find employment. She enjoys songwriting and singing. Her mother Joan says her daughter always gives her all to anything she’s assigned to, she has respect for all the people she works with, and she keeps her promises. She’s also very independent and not someone who is comfortable asking for help.\nBut Jamie says that after she was diagnosed with breast cancer on Jan. 17, 2011, she learned she had to let others help her. She couldn’t do it alone.\n“That was the hardest thing for me as I am very independent …,” she said. “… I had to finally ask for help. … It doesn’t mean that you are a weak person to have to ask, but I was always used to giving help to others and not receiving it.”\nJamie’s battle with breast cancer began with an annual exam with her gynecologist. She said her doctor noticed something looked a little off, so she had Jamie come back a few days later for a diagnostic mammogram rather than waiting for her regular exam scheduled for two months later.\nShe completed the mammogram and began to realize that maybe something was amiss when the technicians continued to tell her she couldn’t leave without speaking to the doctor. The doctor confirmed a calcification had been spotted and Jamie would need to have a biopsy.\n“I had never heard of a calcification so I went home and got on the internet to look it up. It said it was a precursor to breast cancer. After that, I was a little bit more concerned …”\nThe biopsy confirmed Jamie had Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast.\n“I thought, ‘how can that be?’ Because I tried to eat right, exercise, you know all the things people would do to consider themselves to be in good shape and health. And there was no history of it in our immediately family. So that really blew me away …”\nJamie and Joan had already lost Jamie’s sister to another illness the year before, and Jamie lost her father several years before that. But Jamie was determined that her mother was not going to suffer another loss, and she immediately began her fight against the cancer.\nShe said the first thing she began to do was educate herself.\n“I would look up things on my own and then write down all my questions to ask the oncologist and the radiologist, and I would go in with list of questions and write down answers. It helped me a lot. I knew what to do, and I was better prepared. A lot of times you hear things, and I wanted to have the facts. I wanted to be as well informed as I could; I encouraged other people to do that as well. Especially with the drugs and the side effects; that part is very scary.”\nAnd in typical Jamie fashion, she continued working.\n“It was a way for her to not dwell on it every day,” Joan said. “But I hated to see her work so hard every day. As a mother, I was very concerned about her. I know she’s a fighter. We aren’t quitters. We forge ahead and we try to encourage others.”\nJamie added, “I felt better giving back to other people. I didn’t think about what I was going through. It was just a formality of what I had to do.”\nBut in order to continue working, Jamie had to do something she was not comfortable with — she had to ask for help from her coworkers.\nThey picked her up at home and took her to work so she could work a half day, and then someone drove her to the center for her treatment. Someone would then take her from her appointment back to her home.\nShe added that being sick also gave her a new perspective at work.\n“I work with people who have different types of disabilities and help them get back to work. So I was on the other side of the desk this time.\n“I was always sensitive … but now when I worked with someone that had breast cancer, I really did know what they were going through. I didn’t seem to have that many before, but after I was diagnosed, that’s when I started seeing more and I would try to help them get connected to resources that I had used.\nJamie recommends finding support groups to help with all the transitions that come from battling breast cancer.\n“You can get together and if you want to cry, then you can cry and no one judges you. People say you are supposed to feel this way or that way, but how do you know unless you’ve been down that path?\n“It is traumatic and I would say don’t be too hard on yourself. There is no certain way you are supposed to feel. You are entitled to feel and have your own emotions and you can’t always be the rock. ... You may have to be strong for your family and friends but you can’t always keep that up.\n“Give yourself permission to cry, but remember you are not alone. There are so many other people on this journey and there are people that are doing it and experiencing the same feelings you have.”\nShe says the support groups also helped her to connect to other survivors so she could find out what it was like to transition from chemotherapy to radiation. She said their advice helped greatly.\nBut one thing Jamie was not sure about was losing her hair.\n“I’m not vain, but I didn’t like the part of losing my hair so I talked to the doctor about it. He said I could try another treatment but it would not be as effective. I looked at him and said forget that because if I’m going through this, I just might as well lose it all and do what I got to do.\n“… I finally got over it the night I showered and the rest of my hair went down the drain and I thought, oh, well. I don’t look too bad bald.\n“… It’s different but it’s just temporary. The big thing though is I’m still here and I’m still alive and that’s the most important thing.”\nAfter the chemo and the 32 radiation treatments and becoming so tired and weak she ended up having to miss some days at work, Jamie still had to work to do. She had to learn to transition back into the world again — a world not filled with endless doctor visits and painful treatments.\nShe took a cancer transition class offered at Nancy N. and J.C. Lewis Cancer & Research Pavilion at St. Joseph’s/Candler.\n“After treatment, it helps you get back into life again because after you’ve been through this medical merry-go-round for so long, you really don’t know what else is left after all the appointments and the treatments. It just comes to a complete stop one day and you are like, what am I supposed to do now?”\nShe decided the best course of action was to go out and live her life to the fullest.\n“There is a reason I’m still here, and I try to help other people on their journey because you don’t get it all in ‘chemo education.’ They tell you a little bit about the drugs, but I think if we knew the whole intensity of the thing, we may run away. It scares you to death thinking about all the complications. You just do the best you can and move on. You have to.”\nAnd Jamie credits her strong faith for carrying her through the rough times of her cancer journey.\n“When I was told I had cancer, I knew I was going to be OK and I knew God had a reason for it. And it has changed my life in a lot of ways. I was never in a place where I didn’t appreciate life, but I had the tendency to put off things I wanted to do … Now I want to do all kinds of things. Things I’ve never done. If a group goes kayaking, I want to go with them. I’m excited about all the upcoming activities lined up for Breast Cancer Awareness Month; it’s going to be busy.”\nAnd one way Jamie enjoys participating in the community and her church is through her songwriting and music performances, like the ones she has done for Relay for Life and other community events.\nShe says she always tried to include positive messages in her songs, but after battling breast cancer, making her songs more upbeat, encouraging and inspirational became a passion.\n“If you have a gift, use it and help others to reach to the inner soul where other things don’t touch you.\nHer mother Joan said she likes all of Jamie’s songs, but she is especially proud of her song, “Hold on to the Hope,” (2015).\nJamie plays the guitar while Joan accompanies her on the chorus and it’s hard to not be inspired when you hear the lyrics, “Hold on to the hope, hold on to the dream, stay strong, fight hard and believe.”\n“… I know now, I am healed … but I see other survivors who have reoccurrences and that’s something you have to live with as a survivor. I say stay positive and keep living life.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14733346.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14733352.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14733349.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14733351.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14733347.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14733346.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14733348.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14733351.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14733348.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14733347.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14733349.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14733352.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:08:23.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
