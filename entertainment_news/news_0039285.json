Yesterday Adele followed up the surprise airing with a bit about the album on her Facebook page, today she offered up the tracklist, artwork and release date. Tomorrow the Xavier Dolan-directed video for “Hello” is set to premiere. \nYou can go ahead and call it now, even having heard little more than a few notes of “25.” The is the album of the year, and it’s going to absolutely dominate in every way when it drops on Friday, Nov. 25. No need to consult an oddsmaker. \nLike “21,” Adele’s previous paradigm-shifting, diamond-certified platter, you can count on this new record to consume conversations, spawn several singles that garner massive airplay across multiple formats and grab a slew of album of the year nods. \nWhile it will be more than a year before she’s rewarded critically with another armload of statues, as it’s now past the cutoff date for Grammy consideration in 2015, Adele’s likely to enjoy plenty of dividends otherwise. \nThe timing of “25” couldn’t be better for sales (not that Adele needs any help there; her last release was so well received that people actually began buying music again). Due out just a week before Black Friday, you can bet that plenty of people on the planet will be pulling “25” out of their stockings a month or so afterward. \nIn the meantime, here’s the full tracklist (including a trio of songs that will be included exclusively on a release only being made available at Target). \n01. Hello \n02. Send My Love (To Your New Lover) \n03. I Miss You \n04. When We Were Young \n05. Remedy \n06. Water Under The Bridge \n07. River Lea \n08. Love In The Dark \n09. Million Years Ago \n10. All I Ask \n11. Sweetest Devotion \n12. Can’t Let Go* \n13. Lay Me Down* \n14. Why Do You Love Me* \n\n*Target exclusive bonus track. \nHip-hop act The Internet... Catch Rick Springfield...
