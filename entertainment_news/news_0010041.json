The Vishwananthan Committee will give its recommendation this month and take it forward so that there are easy entry and exit norms,” Kant said.\n“Much has been talked about the tax regime, the lack of consistency but we have taken several decisive steps. The Prime Minister has gone on record to say that India will not resort to retrospective tax,” he added.\nKant said the Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi ’s Startup India, Stand up India initiative “will be launched shortly”.\nMoreover, he said, different government departments were working together to smooth the compliances so that it becomes far more easier for start-ups to move ahead without running around for regulatory clearances.\nAsked whether the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will affect India’s foreign trade, Kant said: “We are playing a very major role in RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). We will arrive at some agreement in RCEP.\n“Eventually RCEP will have some linkage with TPP. To my mind, it is important to address these issues of trading blocs with confidence and arrive at win-win agreements so that we can push our manufacturing and exports.\nOn the impact of TPP on India’s generic industry, he said: “I think it is too far-fetched. Right now the TPP has not even been accepted by legislatures across the world. There is a lot of debate and discussion going on and it needs to be accepted by Parliaments. It is a long-term process.”\nThe US, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim nations recently reached a final agreement on the largest regional trade accord in history dubbed as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal.\nBesides, commenting on the survey findings, EY Chairman of the Global Emerging Markets Committee Rajiv Memani said they are a testament to India’s growing appeal with the global investment community.\nThe report highlights data from fDi Markets data, indicating that in the first six months, India has become the top FDI destination with USD 30.8 billion of FDI inflows, moving up from the fifth position in the corresponding period last year.\nMore than three out of five respondents said they had plan to invest in India over the next year and 62 per cent are looking at manufacturing, both to serve the Indian and global markets from India.\nMost of the respondents prefer to expand existing operations, followed by expansion through acquisitions and, if necessary, by joint ventures and alliances.\nCompared to the 2014 survey, the number of respondents who believe that India will be among the world’s leading top three destinations for manufacturing by 2020 has increased from 24 per cent to 35 per cent, while those who believe India will evolve as a regional and global hub for operations is up from 9 per cent to 21 per cent.\nThe survey found that 55 per cent of the respondents were aware of the government’s Make in India campaign. Those aware of Make in India are more upbeat about expansion plans, with 70 per cent stating they are likely to expand or relocate their manufacturing facilities to India in the next five years.\nCheck out EY’s 2014 India attractiveness survey graph:\n 14, 2015 1:32 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:12:15.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
