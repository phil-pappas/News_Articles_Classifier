She started it!'\" said Munro, laughing. \"Suzi's the one who pushes me to do it. She says, 'You know you always love it when the kids come by.'\"\nOn Saturday, Munro and his buddy Tony Zelinsky of Brewerton finished building a gigantic dragon skeleton in the front yard of Munro and Campanaro's house at 107 Sandra Dr. in North Syracuse.\nStan Munro, Suzi Campanaro and Tony Zelinsky created the dragon skeleton Halloween display at 107 Sandra Dr., North Syracuse. Photo by Katrina Tulloch. The skeleton, made from hundreds of pieces of cheap particle board, wood paneling and Masonite hardboard, took about a week to complete.\n\"This year wasn't expensive at all; most of it is recycled wood from previous projects,\" Munro said. \"We keep our costs down and labor is free. Tony gets paid in steak.\"\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 6, Munro wore a (human) skeleton T-shirt as he repainted black teeth onto the dragon's skull.\nGauzy porch screens drape the wing bones and catch the light as the sun goes down. A 14-bone rib cage, tall enough to walk underneath, tapers down to a massive tail which extends around the entire lawn and wraps around a tree.\n\"If we're going to make a dragon, we might as well use the whole yard,\" Munro said.\nAt least 1,000 trick-or-treaters visit the couple's house each year. In 2007, police had to block off Sandra Drive because so many people came to see the display.\n\"The neighbors love it, I think, or they're lying to me,\" Munro said. \"We try to keep it quiet, but one year we had a ghost disco and played disco music every night. [The neighbors] may have gone a little crazy that year.\"\nA decade of Halloween hoopla\nThe tradition began in 2005, when the couple built a giant spider with human cocoons on their roof. In the last decade, they've created a different scene nearly every year.\nStan Munro's \"Evolution of Execution\" display for Halloween 2006. Michael Greenlar | mgreenlar@syracuse.com In 2006, they made a \"History of Execution\" display, with a working gas chamber and exhibits of lethal injection, hanging, an electric chair and 15-foot-tall guillotine.\n\"That kind of bordered on disturbing, but it was all for fun,\" Munro said.\nIn 2007, the couple's giant spaceship drew the attention of a North Syracuse code inspector, who issued Munro a ticket because he thought they were building a gazebo on their front lawn.\n\"Once we explained it wasn't permanent, everything was fine,\" Munro said at the time.\nThe smoking, flying saucer \"wreckage\" and its dead alien pilot cost Munro close to $1,000. The dead alien was $400, but Munro says it's \"still a member of our family.\"\nHe also created a ghost disco (2008), Death Star gas station with Darth Vader (2013) and zombie family (2014), all of which are featured on halloweenlawn.com .\nStan Munro's Toothpick City II at the MOST This video features Stan Munro, of North Syracuse, who is building Toothpick City II, a collection of religious buildings and towers from across the world. The exhibit, built using toothpicks and Elmer's Glue, is on display at the Milton J. Rubenste\nMunro is known around Central New York as the toothpick engineer behind the extravagant Toothpick City displays at the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology and the New York State Fair.\nHis toothpicking has been featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not museums in Orlando, Fla. and Branson, Mo.\n\"These [dragon bones] are just giant toothpicks to me,\" Munro said.\nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
