Gone are the days of \"free-to-air\" networks having the sole decision of what we watch. \nFoxtel and the rise and fall of its competitors (Austar/Optus) presented us with more choice of content, but the recent influx of Streaming Video On Demand (or SVOD) services have broadened our view. \nPresto, Stan and Netflix are the heaviest hitters, though other services like Quickflix lurk in the background as easier alternatives to the rapidly closing Blockbusters, Video Ezys and Civic Videos of the world. \nWith so much content available comes one of the tough choices: what do you watch? \nThis is where Switched On comes in. Not only will I share what's on the box and what I've seen, but I want to know what you're watching. \nKeep an eye on our website for previews and reviews of what I've seen, and let me know what you thought, or what you think we should be watching. column", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:00:22.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
