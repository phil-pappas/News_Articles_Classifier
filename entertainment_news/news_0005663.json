(Photo: Jaap Buitendijk, DreamWorks)\n15 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE As good-hearted and perseverant lawyer James Donovan in Bridge of Spies , Tom Hanks has a scene where he inexplicably orders two breakfasts in a German hotel.\nHis earnest attorney doesn’t get to eat either of them — thus how days go for an embattled guy caught between sides of the Cold War — but the idea of a meal is fitting when talking about director Steven Spielberg’s latest historical drama (*** out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide). It's the very definition of meat and potatoes: While not phenomenal, especially compared to the rest of the Spielberg oeuvre, Spies still hits the spot.\nSpielberg and Hanks team for the fourth time with Spies , which is inspired by the real-life events that took place during the post-World War II paranoia of the 1950s and early '60s.\nRudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a quiet, older Brooklyn man, is arrested for being a Soviet spy, and the CIA recruits Donovan to defend him in a court of law. Donovan — a reputable New York insurance lawyer who assisted in the 1945 Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals — takes the case, though his wife (Amy Ryan) and law partner (Alan Alda) strongly discourage it.\nUSA TODAY\nSpielberg builds A ‘Bridge’ to Cold War era\nNo wonder, since he becomes as much an infamous celebrity as his calm client. Spielberg strongly sets the story in the mood of the time, where anything involving Russia bristled the populace — Donovan rides the subway to work, and with his face on the front page of everyone’s newspaper, he has nowhere to look without getting the stink eye from fellow commuters.\nAbel is found guilty, but Donovan’s involvement only gets more complicated when he’s tasked to head to Berlin and negotiate the trade of Abel for Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), the U-2 pilot being held by the Soviets as a spy after being shot down over Russian airspace.\nBridge of Spies has so many fascinating personalities that it could as easily focus on Powers as it could Donovan’s CIA handler (Scott Shepherd), who is such a secret agent that he seems to be popping in from his own movie most of the time.\nBut having it be Donovan’s story is classic Spielberg — the tale of an ordinary dude going to the ends of the Earth to do the right thing is in the same wheelhouse as Daniel Day-Lewis' 16th president in Lincoln and Harrison Ford’s whip-snapping globetrotter in Raiders of the Lost Ark .\nUSA TODAY\n5 things we learned about 'Bridge of Spies'\nSpielberg’s longtime cinematographer, two-time Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski, takes usual period and spy tropes and make them look like works of art, from the chaos-laden courtroom scenes to the stark tones of East Germany and the iconic Glienicke Bridge.\nHanks is, as usual, rock solid as Donovan, giving an extra air of humanity to a rookie wading into the rough and murky waters of espionage. The Coen brothers boost the Spies script, especially in the interactions between Donovan and Abel as they forge a friendship — Donovan cares and worries about his client's well-being, and Abel plays the good soldier who won’t give the CIA anything about his covert work.\nRylance, a known commodity to the PBS faithful of Wolf Hall and super-fans of the English stage, is a brilliant revelation here to everyone else. He emits an icy intensity yet also a kind nature as Abel sits reserved, either in jail, a courtroom or on a freezing-cold bridge, waiting for whatever fate chooses for him.\nOf all of the meaty performances in this Spielberg smorgasbord, Rylance is the one to really savor.\n15 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/1RJRnmX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RJRnmX&text=Review%3A%20%27Bridge%20of%20Spies%27%20is%20one%20to%20savor&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374598262496-XXX-BRIDGEOFSPIES02-MOV-DCB-74793468.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582836001_video-still-for-video-4388327943001.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582836001_video-still-for-video-4388327943001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374598262496-XXX-BRIDGEOFSPIES02-MOV-DCB-74793468.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b33d303fe5aaa681024b49b940017a0eee3f734e/c=0-854-3251-4105/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374309660646-XXX-STEVEN-SPIELBERG---BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-PORTRAIT-TP-76350664.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582826001_thumbnail-for-video-4388327943001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1RJRnmX", "http://usat.ly/1I607jn", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RJRnmX&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37679a88d8cb5fe10a6f608ec63106b3b4cac142/c=98-0-4307-3165&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374598262496-XXX-BRIDGEOFSPIES02-MOV-DCB-74793468.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/596e88388cc8d5715358137832c901ba5a96e91e/c=1314-0-3834-2520/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795717661578292-XXX-BRIDGEOFSPIES02-MOV-DCB-74793468.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/07/29906170001_4388582836001_video-still-for-video-4388327943001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:35:24.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
