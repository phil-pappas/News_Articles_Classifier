She was 11 at the time and living in her native Syracuse. She and her younger brother went to visit their grandparents in Philadelphia for a week and learned that the hottest new Nintendo game was out. She remembers going to the local mall and there being only 10 copies left. Luckily, she and her brother grabbed one.\nWhen she and her 9-year-old brother got back to their grandparents home, there was no stopping them.\n\"We played that game non-stop until we beat it at like 3 a.m.,\" Sheba said, remembering the way Mario wore a raccoon suit or a frog suit.\nSheba, now 41, hadn't played Super Mario again until Saturday when she traveled from Webster to The Strong Museum of Play to see the new Nintendo exhibit. The museum created the exhibit to help celebrate the company's 30-year existence in America. Nintendo itself has been around for more than 125, although it started as a playing card game company.\nNearly everyone who walked past the Nintendo exhibit Saturday had fond memories of playing Donkey Kong, Super Mario or The Legend of Zelda, staple video games in the Nintendo gaming consoles. Sheba remembers spending hours playing the game and how much she preferred Mario over Luigi.\n\"He just seemed like the brother more in control,\" she said.\nJason Murawski's favorite memory was playing the first Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Having long played games were they never moved, Murawski said he was mesmerized at how Mario moved across a moving landscape. The Buffalo resident said he still plays Nintendo games.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nStrong establishes Video Game Hall of Fame\nDon James, who is now the executive vice president of operations for Nintendo, started on a team of guys who sold Nintendos up and down the East Coast.\nJames, who was in Rochester on Saturday to see the exhibit, said he remembered his crew renting a warehouse in Hackensack, New Jersey, so they could receive the game systems from Japan. When the shipments came in, James and his crew worked 12-hour days for 3 months, setting up displays from 6 p.m. to midnight then using four vans to drive them to stores.\n\"It was a labor of love, but it was one of the hardest things we ever did,\" James said. \"I was a lot younger then, so I didn't need as much sleep and we had a lot of adrenaline.\"\nBuy Photo Austin Bennett, 9, of Syracuse plays giant Super Mario at the Nintendo exhibit opening at the Strong Museum of Play on Saturday, October 24, 2015.

For the first time, gamers were allowed to move in any direction and determine the pace of the game.\nShane Rhinewald, the museum's spokesman, said The Strong created this exhibit so patrons of all generations could play Nintendo games. The exhibit has video games on a big screen and in arcade form as well as original documents and designs from Nintendo game consoles.\nBack when James was moving Nintendo displays, he said he wasn't thinking about how big the company would become in America. He said someone else had a much better premonition than him.\n\"I do remember one of my co-workers saying 'If this takes off, imagine what it'll do for the company',\" James said.\nKJBROOKS@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c6435b63ea068caf3a3bd87df3898a2e4985cd3a/c=1231-0-3917-2686/local/-/media/2015/02/17/Rochester/Rochester/635597835923644598-Strong-Games1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7c866b662bebf1efe4447b572ca408abb4efcc0/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812934818771750-LP-nintendo-exhibit-D-102415-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812934818771750-LP-nintendo-exhibit-D-102415-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/Rochester/Rochester/635812934818771750-LP-nintendo-exhibit-D-102415-Metro.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:07:34.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
