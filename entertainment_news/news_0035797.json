The new “ General Hospital ” writers have a lot to prove during this sweeps period, especially because the Jason reveal has been a year in the making. According to a report from Celeb Dirty Laundry on Sunday, Liz may have second thoughts about marrying Jake with all of the lies she has been telling. That will be thwarted when she sees just how wonderful he is with her boys when he takes them trick-or-treating. The truth about Jason is set to come out Nov. 6, but no one knows if it will be only to him or to the entire town.\nDiane Miller is going to be arriving back in Port Charles to save Spinelli . She is less than pleased with Sam for allowing Spinelli to get himself arrested when he has a young child to worry about. As it turns out, Miller will get him released but he will immediately be back to looking for the truth about Jake. “ General Hospital ” fans have been wondering for some time about whether or not Spinelli would be the one to crack the case. While it isn't confirmed, it looks like it just may be the way things play out.\nLittle Jake made a big reveal last week to Jake telling him he was his real father. The look on Liz's face was one for the books. He knows what he overheard when Laura and Liz were talking, and he is not changing his mind. “General Hospital” writers are making Jake a little “off” and his claims may be overlooked as part of whatever is happening with this young man. He hasn't been the same since being rescued, surely Liz will use that as an excuse. This week is going to be good, you won't want to miss a single minute!", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/GeneralHospital", "http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2015/general-hospital-spoilers-week-spinelli-closes-in-on-jakes-identity-lulu-and-dante-implode-paul-blackmails-anna/"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:27:49.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
