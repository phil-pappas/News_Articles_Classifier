Speaking on the Standpoint TV with Gifty Anti, Amanda said companies easily contract celebrities with huge followers on social media networks to advertise their products. Amanda Jissih further said these celebrities buy followers on Facebook, twitter, instagram and other platforms because “we want to make money and if that is the only to make money, then we will do it.” Speaking on the topic, ‘female celebrities and negative publicity’ the radio show host disclosed that some Ghanaian celebrities pay bloggers to publish bad stories in order to bring attention on them. Touching on negative attacks on her, Amanda revealed that she has heard a lot of people talk evil against her size but she is not worried anymore. According to her, she usually blocks people who talk ill about her on social media in order to have time for her job. \nShe said she has blocked over 100 contacts who constantly harass and attack her based on her body size. The 100, she said, included her relatives, fans and unknown persons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:02:45.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
