On Rod Stewart’s new album, “Another Country,” the blond’s roots show with folksy tune “Love Is” and the dirty groove he dug with the Faces on “Please” (check out that moaning, screaming, and loud guitar).\nBut “Another Country” won’t scratch that “Every Picture Tells a Story” itch. Just like Rod’s last album, 2013’s “Time,” this one only teases a return to form. Instead Stewart and his co-writer\nco-producer Kevin Savigar riff off of ridiculous inspirations and bad pop. They rewrite “Hey, Soul Sister” for the hokey “Hold the Line.” They aim for reggae with “Love and Be Loved” and hit something just for the lobby of the Tampa Ramada.\nTo list the misses would fill this page so here’s the takeaway: Rod’s fans and foes need to spin his re-recording of acid rock gem “In a Broken Dream” (a ’60s tune he sang with Python Lee Jackson) to hear what he’s still capable of (Jeff Beck, pick up the phone and beg Rod to tour with you one last time). The rest is mostly awful.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Rod+Stewart%2C+%E2%80%9CAnother+Country%E2%80%9D"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:33:21.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
