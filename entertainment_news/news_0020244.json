Five of the best known executives in tech, Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon (AMZN), Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Alphabet (GOOGL), Bill Gates of Microsoft (MSFT) and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (FB), all together hauled in more than $10 billion in gains Friday from their stocks following astounding earnings reports. That's a big slice of the $90 billion in total market value creation minted on Friday for all investors who own these shares.\nThe biggest winner is Jeffrey Bezos, the visionary CEO who morphed Amazon from an online bookseller into a global provider of products that range from cloud services to consumer goods.\nBezos hauled in $2.9 billion himself thanks to the stock's 6.2% jump to close at $599.03. Amazon shares soared after the company delivered an adjusted quarterly profit of 17 cents a share, thrilling investors who were braced for a loss of 13 cents a share.\nNot far behind is Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google. Shares of the company gained 5.6% Friday to $719.33 after topping analysts' forecasts for the third quarter by 2% when it reported results Thursday evening. Adjusted profit came in at $7.35 a share, which was up 16% from the same period a year ago.\nThat massive pop in the stock went straight to Page's pocketbook, adding $2.5 billion. Alphabet's other top shareholder and co-founder Sergey Brin scored $2.4 billion as well.\nUSA TODAY\nTech stocks' rise shakes up list of world's richest\nBill Gates' Microsoft is back, too. Gates, who has gradually sold shares over the years to fund his global philanthropic goals, still owns 223.4 million shares of Microsoft. That's enough for him to generate a $1.1 billion gain, thanks to Microsoft's massive 10% stock gain to $3.03.\nMicrosoft's shares jumped by a larger percentage than any of the other big tech stocks following a resoundingly strong profit report from the company. The report highlighted success in the cloud, as well as with its Office 365 and Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft reported an adjusted quarterly profit of 67 cents a share, beating expectations by 14%.\nInvestors are so giddy about tech that they're pouring into shares of companies that haven't even reported yet.\nFacebook shares Friday rose 2.5% to $102.19 - breaking the $100 a share barrier for the first time. That's enough to add $1.1 billion to CEO Zuckerberg's wallet - even though the social networking company doesn't report profit until Nov. 4.\nIt's a great day to be a tech titan - but doesn't it seem like everyday is?\nBIGGEST PAPER WEALTH GAINS OF TECH TITANS\nExecutive, Company, Stock gain Friday ($ millions)\nJeffrey Bezos, Amazon, $2,912\nLarry Page, Alphabet, $2,480\nSergey Brin, Alphabet, $2,423\nBill Gates, Microsoft, $1,117\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook, $1,074\nSources: S&P Capital IQ, USA TODAY\nFollow Matt Krantz on Twitter @mattkrantz", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/23/stocks-up-richest-men-amazon-google-microsoft-bezos-gates-zuckerberg-brin-page/74462002/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dcf7a5e162ecaf424bb786a3bfcd0eb1be1097de/c=0-153-3000-1848&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/11/07/635509491171060283-GTY-456327328.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:46:13.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
