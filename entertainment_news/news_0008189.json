Thanks so much guys. I'm pretty sure this is just because I have cute cats though. (sic)\" \nAnd despite her 50 million followers not being able to get enough of her, the 25-year-old beauty recently admitted she feels as though people \"need a break\" from her. \nShe shared: \"I think I should take some time off. People might need a break from me. I'm going to hang out with friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know. \n\"If you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up, then you'll be done. A lot of the time I call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and that matter.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:29:31.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
