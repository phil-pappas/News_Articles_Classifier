By Seth G. Macy \nDestiny 's story originally revolved around players and their hunt for Rasputin, a Warmind now found in the Cosmodrome. According to a report by Kotaku , that story was scrapped in 2013 and completely retooled using assets already in place in the game. \n\"Bungie ditched everything\" that had been written by former cinematic director Joe Staten and his team, according to the report. That meant everything needed to be reworked, as Bungie \"scrapped plot threads, overhauled characters, and rewrote most of the dialogue\" for the game. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \nThe game's original plot was condensed into a cinematic \"super cut,\" which was shown to Bungie leadership. According to Kotaku, the plot revolved around the Alien Hive kidnapping Rasputin and taking him to their Dreadnaught spaceship, something which was moved to The Taken King. \"Originally, this Hive ship would have been part of the main story,\" the report states, saying the last third of the game took place entirely on the Dreadnaught. \nHowever, studio leaders felt the story was \"too campy and linear,\" and scrapped it, starting again from scratch. Parts of the game that already existed needed to be reworked to fit into the new story, and many elements of the final game were much larger parts of the original story. The Trials of Osiris reference Osiris, who originally served as a guide for players. Osiris' robotic guide was also scrapped and retooled and, according to the Kotaku story, eventually became The Stranger. \nOther parts of the game were reused and retooled for The Taken King, and a piece that originally was planned for The Taken King expansion was given to High Moon Studios to be part of the alleged Destiny sequel planned for 2016 . \nSeth Macy is a freelance writer who just wants to be your friend.
