Among the findings is that millennials, defined as people ages 18-34, want to see brands in the music space and enjoy seeing them there.\nThis is especially notable because of the important role music plays in the lives of millennials, 81% of whom said music triggers their best memories. Millennials listen to 6-10 hours of music every week, compared to non-millennials, who report 1-5 hours. The research's data shows the acceptance and popularity of music for delivering brand messages. Of millennial respondents who engaged in a branded music experience, 93% like brands that sponsor live events; while 8 in 10 say the most effective way to connect with them is through a branded live music experience. Moreover, 81% of millennials claim that the coolest brand experiences they've seen are around live events.\nThe research was created to examine real life and digital music behaviors tied to sharing, discovery and purchase across all age groups. The data illustrates which behaviors define those connections and the motivations behind some of the more measurable behaviors. Main focus areas included: the value people find in the modern live music experience, and how they choose which experiences to participate in; how popular social channels contribute to real life experience; and how brands can be an authentic part of the live/digital music ecosystem.\n\"When it comes to connecting with consumers, especially millennials, music is one of the most effective ways. For brands, the opportunity exists within music to create value for their customers and build a lasting relationship unlike any other,\" according to Glenn Minerley , Momentum Worldwide's VP, Group Director – Music and Entertainment. \"This research proves that people welcome brands into their music experiences; it's the brand and marketing world's challenge now to do so in a way that is unobtrusive, memorable and provides authentic value to both sides. There's never been a better time to align brands and music.\"\nThe report underscores the incomparable power of live events to drive consumers to recommend and buy brands-especially among millennials. This research proves that live events have the greatest and most positive impact on consumer behavior across the entire \"purchase funnel,\" and demonstrates the primacy of live events to mobilize consumers to share these experiences across their social networks.\nFurther insights from the study include:\nLive Events & Brands: Live music is the key driver for brands to deepen their impact among millennials.

Millennials are significantly more likely to use their mobile device to purchase tickets to live music experiences. Nearly half use mobile phones to purchase tickets (46%) vs. (24%) of non-millennials. \"If you're a brand, you want to be associated with someone having a transformational moment in their life, and for many people, live music experiences do just that,\" said Scott Carlis , Vice President, Digital, Social Media & Marketing at AEG Global Partnerships. \"What this research shows is that consumers will reward brands for interactions in the live music space that enhance or add value to their experience, which gives brands the opportunity to play the hero of those transformational moments.\"\nThe survey accounts for 1,048 total responses, age 18 or older. 75% of the panel-recruited from an online panel provided by Qualtrics-were millennials.\nABOUT MOMENTUM WORLDWIDE\nMomentum Worldwide is built on the simple truth that it's not what brands say, it's what they do that matters.
