Bieber's legal representatives are calling on the paper to remove the pics from its site or else face a lawsuit, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nThe letter, obtained by the entertainment industry trade publication, was sent shortly after the photos were published, demanding compliance within 12 hours of receipt. \n\"We recently became informed that your company has obtained and is distributing unauthorized photographs of our Client including images showing him without clothing,\" reads the letter. \nBieber's legal team states the publication of the photos represents a violation of the singer's publicity and privacy rights and, according to the letter, infringe on the singer's trademarks. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:59:46.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
