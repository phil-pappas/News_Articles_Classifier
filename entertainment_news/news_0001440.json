World-class infrastructure and a dedicated 126-member team, led by Dr Suresh Rao (Director, Children's Heart Centre), with NICU and PICU specialities, guarantee outcomes comparable with international benchmarks. The centre bridges a vital gap in the healthcare fabric â€” only around 10,000-15,000 congenital heart surgeries are performed in India annually, a fraction of what needs to be done, owing to lack of access to comprehensive paediatric care and the high costs involved.\nGiven Mumbai's connectivity, this centre at Kokilaben Hospital, over the last six years, has not only catered to children from Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra, but also in increasing numbers nationally, from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, and internationally from Iraq, Yemen, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania and Hong Kong.
