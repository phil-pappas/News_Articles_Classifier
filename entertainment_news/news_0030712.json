The competitors begin performing on Saturday, starting with Poland's Tymoteusz Bies.\nThe 17-member jury, largely composed of competition winners and laureates, will announce the winner of the main prize Oct. 20. It includes concerts in some of the world's best-known halls, contracts for recordings and a 30,000-euro ($33,600) prize.\nIn its 88-year history, the Chopin competition has earned a reputation of one of the world's top piano events, opening world careers to young pianists.\nPast winners include Maurizio Pollini in 1960, Garrick Ohlsson in 1970 and Krystian Zimerman in 1975.\nBorn in 1810 near Warsaw to a Polish mother and a French father, Chopin studied music and gave his first concerts in Warsaw. At the age of 21 he settled in Paris, the center of Europe's musical life, where he composed, performed and taught the piano. He died there in 1849.\nChopin composed almost entirely for the piano, drawing inspiration from Poland's folk and dance music, like the mazurka and the polonaise.\nCopyright The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-01T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:02:11.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
