Nice and shiny, I don't have to worry about it,\" the \"Die Hard\" star, who will star in Broadways \"Misery,\" told Fallon. \nWatch the clip below for a laugh: \n<p>></p> \nMaybe Willis was just trying on his Halloween costume a couple of weeks early. His wife Emma Heming-Willis is already getting in the Halloween spirit with a Westchester tradition. The parenting blogger shared photos on Instagram from her visit to The Great Jack O'Lantern Blaze in Croton-on-Hudson. \nPhoto: NBC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:09:47.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
