The unit makes it easier to select which movie to see. It also enables patrons to purchase tickets for the movie. The invention saves time and effort when visiting the cinema, as it minimizes time spent waiting in line for tickets. All of this makes going to the movies more enjoyable.\nThe original design was submitted to the Orlando office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
