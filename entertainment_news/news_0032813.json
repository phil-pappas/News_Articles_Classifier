Unfortunately my new rescue puppy, Gracie, won't be able to compete in BatFest's new pet contest, sponsored by the Batavia Animal Clinic.\nAlthough \"She ain't nothing but a hound dog,\" Gracie might have had an inside track with or without an Elvis costume.\nrelated advertisement If you go\nWhat: BatFest, Batavia's annual Halloween-themed family event\nWhen: 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24\nWhere: Along the Batavia Riverwalk and Peg Bond Pavilion\nAdmission: Free\nDetails: www.downtownbatvia.com Dr. Adam Schanding, the new owner of the Batavia Animal Clinic has a puppy who, like Gracie, is a plot hound mix.\n\"Seeing another plot hound mix would definitely be worth a second look,\" he said.\nIn case you think there might be a bit of \"canine collusion\" going on here. Schanding is covering all his bases, by having two out-of-town pet lovers join him at the judges' table.\nAccording to the animal clinic receptionist, Sarah Theros, there will be different categories: funniest costume, scariest costume and most original costume. There will be goody bags and prizes for the winners consisting of dog toys and treats.\nWhat happens if a cat wins, or guinea pig, or a well-costumed cockatiel?\n\"We usually see dogs in pet costumes, but I guess we'll have to be ready for anything,\" said Schanding.\nThe pet parade takes place at 12:30 p.m. and it is just one event that takes place at BatFest,\n\"This is a family event that really focuses on little kids,\" said Jaime Saam, of Batavia MainStreet. \"It is such a fun event and almost everything is free.\"\nThe day kicks off at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 24, with trick-or-treating; kids can get a map to see which businesses are participating.\n\"I start getting calls early in September from businesses who want to make sure I include them on the map,\" Saam said. \"Our downtown businesses really enjoy being a part of this.\"\nOne of the most popular events,\"the Pumpkin Bowl,\" had to undergo some changes. Since Houston Street is under construction, the Houston Street hill is out of commission.\n\"Instead of rolling the pumpkins down the hill, Troop 6 of the Boy Scouts has partnered with Funway to set up bowling lanes,\" Saam said.\nAnne Gugliuzza will bring her dancers from Batavia Dance Academy back to perform dance moves to \"Thriller\" and \"Monster Mash.\" It's always fun to see the dancers on the stage in costume and the kids in the audience trying to mimic the dance moves.\nThe popular pumpkin seed spitting contest returns and kids can try their luck at the Marshmallow Shooting Range.\nKids in costume are welcome to participate in the Mothers' Club costume parade at 11:50 a.m., followed by the kids costume contest sponsored by Music Matters, on the main stage with Jeff Matter and Craig Foltos assuming the masters of ceremony duties. The pet costume contest follows at 12:45 p.m.\nEven though River City Church has moved to a new location in St. Charles, the community-focused church returns offering special games and the popular photo booth.\n\"Kids are so proud of their costumes,\" said Saam. \"They love having their picture taken and having the strip of photos to take home.\"\nOf course you don't have to be a kid to enjoy BatFest. It's fun to see all the kids in costume, watch the pumpkin-carving battle and marvel at the 3-D pumpkin carving done by Brian Eberle and his staff at Fallen StarTattoos. They start carving these phenomenal pumpkins the night before BatFest and are up most of the night carving. They are really something to see.\nThere are tractor-pulled hayrides sponsored by the Batavia Park District and you don't even have to make a second trip to River Street for the Batavia Farmers Market since it will be moved to the Peg Bond Center for this weekend.\nOf course this family event would not take place without the cooperation of the downtown business community and the many volunteers who help with MainStreet events.\n\"Batavia is a great small town community\" said Schanding. \"Everyone has been so welcoming to me. I'm happy to be a part of it.\"\nFor details, visit www.downtownbatavia.com .\n News Festivals/Fairs Batavia King, Sammi Batavia Unit District 101", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:36:54.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
