Leone was running to regain his office against local conductor Jack Gaughan. \nLeone and his supporters contend the union's own bylaws are unconstitutional, and that only criminal acts should force a president to step down. Instead, Leone was found guilty of not letting the Circus-Circus musicians vote to ratify the new contract. \nBut the national board held to a strict definiton of the bylaw, which states a candidate must \"not have been convicted of violating the bylaws and policies of any Local or those of the AFM\" in the past two years. \nIn a news letter released to members today, the parent union said the local's elections committee \"improperly certified\" Leone and committed \"a serious procedural error.\" \nInstead of holding the election \"knowing in advance that the election was defective and subject to a challenge with a rerun election as the certain remedy,\" the executive board instead decided \"a trusteeship with an immediate reboot of the election process was in the best interests and welfare of the membership, rather than subjecting it to an entire rerun election process after the fact,\" according to the newsletter. \nUnion members are invited to a Thursday meeting to nominate new officers, and the new vote is set for Dec. 19. The trusteeship would likely end at the end of the calendar year, Shirk said. \nKeith Nelson, who had stepped up from secretary-treasurer to serve as the interim president, has been appointed to handle the local's day-to-day administrative affairs. \nRead more from Mike Weatherford at reviewjournal.com.
