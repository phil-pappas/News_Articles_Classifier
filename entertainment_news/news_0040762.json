Instead of having a traditional fashion show, the famed designer releases a music video that sees the Mother Monster and a bunch of models walking the runway and strutting their stuff in front of camera. GaGa and her model pals turn the catwalk into a disco dance party with a cover version of \"I Want Your Love\" that she recorded with the original artist Nile Rodgers setting the retro vibes. GaGa is seen flashing her butt cheek and lace underwear in the Nick Knight-directed clip. \"Having a runway show has become so much about the creation of imagery for online and social media and watching a filmed fashion show can be like watching a filmed play [which is never very satisfying],\" Ford said. \"It was a great deal of fun to do and I think that the video captures the spirit of the collection in a way that a filmed traditional show would not have.\" Tom Ford himself, besides being a famous fashion designer, is a critically-acclaimed movie director. His 2009 directorial debut, \" A Single Man \", gave Colin Firth an Oscar nomination and Julianne Moore a Golden Globe nod. His next movie, \" Nocturnal Animals \", is due to film later this year. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal , Amy Adams , Aaron Johnson , Armie Hammer , Isla Fisher , and Kim Basinger . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:08.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
