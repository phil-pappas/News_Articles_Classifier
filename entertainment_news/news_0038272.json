(March 20 - April 19): Don't mix love and money. You have the ability to get your finances in order and shouldn't be looking to someone you like to bail you out. You'll only regret it.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): A boss or client dangles a juicy morsel in front of you. Don't pounce right away because there's a lot more you can do to fatten the deal first.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Expect to get a lot of flack for not backing up a colleague. However this is nothing compared to the grief that lay in store if you had.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): If you're uncomfortable trying something new, then don't. There have been a lot of changes lately and you may have had your fill for now.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): This is one instance when too much pride is a good thing. It makes you care more at a time when others could care less.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You're supposed to be head-over-heels when you fall in love. What's the fun in it if you can't make a fool of yourself? Let loose!\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Either you or a supervisor will be transferring departments soon. This changing of the guard will breathe new life back into work.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): You're a sex magnet with Ruling Planet Pluto trine Venus. This is good if you're unattached, but could prove hard to explain if you're not. It lasts through the 30th.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): Sometimes you have to give to get, but not today. Your generosity is attracting the wrong kind of attention. Rein it in.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): You may not have been looking, but someone is certainly responding. Feel free to take this as a form of flattery â€“ or even further if you like.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): Are you about to make the deal of the century or sell your soul? It's hard to tell now, but you'll for certain in two weeks.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): In your efforts to be flexible, you may have gotten a bit too fuzzy about parameters. Act fast or that non-binding agreement will become just that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:37:45.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
