Please do not ignore them or injured consumers like me any longer,\" Case testified as she urged the FDA to take this toxic product off the market.\n\"Evidence of Harm\" chronicles the lives of three ordinary Americans who become reluctant health advocates after suffering from the devastating effects of hazardous mercury vapors generated during routine dental procedures. The film presents a haunting portrait of a dental industry all too willing to turn a blind eye to science while placing profits and politics ahead of the 120 million Americans currently implanted with toxic mercury amalgam dental fillings.\nFilmmaker Randall Moore began researching mercury fillings after his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Moore discovered that all \"silver\" dental fillings contain approximately 50% elemental mercury. Moore stated, \"I became frustrated with our government's refusal to remove this toxic product from the marketplace. So I created this documentary to alert others of the widespread dangers of how this dental material adversely impacts public health and the environment worldwide.\"\nVideo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJO1C_ELvKc\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278174\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/investigative-news-reporter-stacy-case-discusses-her-story-as-evidence-of-harm-begins-oscar-qualifying-theatrical-run-300162359.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
