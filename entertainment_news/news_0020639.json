Surveillance images revealed the women abandoning the poodle mix, named \"Nino,\" outside of the vet clinic on Main Street on Tuesday morning.\nThe dog's name is known because an embedded microchip revealed owner information - a phone call led the veterinary staff to a person who let them know that Nino had vanished from their yard over a year ago.\nNino was in such poor condition when he was first discovered that he had to be stabilized. An exam revealed that he was suffering from a multitude of health issues, including bacterial infections, trauma, wounds and skin lesions. Because Nino's condition is so poor, an investigation has been instigated to try and find whoever is responsible for the neglect and abandonment -acting District Attorney Madeline Singas said, \"Those who harm innocent animals, often hurt people, and we're seeking the public's help to find the criminal who stole and abused this innocent animal. \"\nAnyone with tips or information is asked to call the tip line at 516-571-7755, option 8 - callers can remain anonymous.\nNational Dog News Examiner on Facebook (click 'get notifications' on the page to receive updates).", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/National-Dog-News-Examiner-151051931581705/", "http://abc7ny.com/1032918/"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:32:49.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
