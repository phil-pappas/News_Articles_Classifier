Revitalization of the center is considered essential to boosting downtown Rutherford's businesses. \n\"I don't quite understand what they're trying to do or why they went political,\" DeSalvo said Tuesday. \"In good faith, I answered the questions that they put out because they said they wanted to be fair to both candidates. I don't think they're fair to both candidates by endorsing.\" \nAt issue is the future of the closed center, which is owned by Bergen County and has a movie theater and a stage. This spring Save the Williams Center presented Bergen freeholders with a petition, accompanied by roughly 1,300 signatures, asking that the facility remain an arts center. In September the freeholders voted to retain Alaimo Group Consulting Engineers to conduct a study of the center, which is closed due to structural problems. \nOn its Facebook page, Save the Williams Center said it was concerned by some of DeSalvo's answers. The group noted that DeSalvo had talked about maintaining a \"theater component\" of the center. \n\"This language is troubling because the mayor has not been public about the redevelopment plans and has not clarified what a 'theater component' means in the context of trying to increase the ratables for that property and location,\" the group wrote. \"These statements reflect a vision that does not include a renovation of the current Williams Center and The Newman Theatre.\" \nIn contrast, Save the Williams Center said, McGowan as mayor \"would help to further our mission of renovating and restoring\" the center and its theater. \n\"In addition, we do not feel that Mayor DeSalvo has done enough during his tenure as mayor to work with the county and the board of trustees to help the struggling center succeed,\" the group said. \nMcGowan called the endorsement \"a pleasant surprise\" and said she was honored to receive it. \nMcGowan contended that the center hadn't received any attention under DeSalvo's administration but had been brought to the forefront by Save the Williams Center, a collection of borough citizens with just over 1,000 members. \n\"Kudos to them because they forced the hand of the community to have to address it,\" McGowan said. \nIn an email on Tuesday, Annika Cioffi, one of the group's leaders, said the endorsement has received mixed reviews. \nOverall, she said, the group has received \"tremendous support from our Facebook members,\" and that \"the non-supportive comments have mostly come from members we never hear from.\" \nOne of the critics of the endorsement, John Hughes, posted, \"I am stunned that this group took the political route after all the good stuff they started.\" \nDeSalvo said he has addressed the Williams Center issue during his tenure, in part by working on a redevelopment proposal for the site. With a redevelopment plan, the borough \"can steer the ship if a private entity\" acquires the facility, DeSalvo said. \nThe mayor also tried to form a committee on the center, inviting Cioffi and other Save the Williams Group members to be part of it. They refused. \n\"We're still waiting for the county to get that study done, and then at that point I guess we can make some decisions,\" DeSalvo said. \"As I said in the past, I'm willing to work with everybody; it just doesn't need to be a political football for Save the Williams Center.\" \nEmail: moss@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:57:28.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
