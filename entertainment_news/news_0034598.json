He went to Hawaii on behalf of the tribe in 2013.\n\"It became clear from his research that the totem pole was a sacred object of cultural patrimony and we immediately decided the totem pole should be returned home,\" said Stephan Jost, director of the Honolulu Museum of Art.\nSeveral members of the tribe traveled from Klawock, their present-day village of roughly 800 residents, to Honolulu for a transfer ceremony on Thursday that included music and an exchange of gifts, the museum said.\nThe pole is to be placed in the tribe's cultural heritage center, with a replica planned for the village, Langdon said.\n(Reporting by Eric M.
