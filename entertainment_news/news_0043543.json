I don't think it should come back. I think it's very lazy to regenerate something.\"Surely we can be a bit more creative and come up with something new and give it the time and space to grow and build an audience?\"She added: \"Sometimes I think that TV's treated in the same way that football managers are. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4545789983001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14545789983001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4545789983001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4545789983001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14545789983001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4545789983001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } \"You bring a football manager in and if he doesn't pick up a trophy in the first season he's out.\"Similarly with TV - you have to invest in it. You're not going to get a massive audience in the first series or the first three programmes but give it time and let it build.\"I sometimes feel broadcasters need to do that rather than hoping for that quick fix - it adds to longevity as well.\"Asked about the nostalgia some people still have for the show, Edith said: \"I got to host it so I should have a bit more nostalgia than that - and there's so much romanticism around Top of the Pops because it did go on for so long.\"But I think we've got enough talented people that are involved in TV that surely we can come up with a really fun, exciting different music show that looks forward rather than looks back.\" © Hotel Indigo Since Top of the Pops was axed, the BBC has aired Christmas and New Year specials, hosted by Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates.Edith Bowman and local talents have curated playlists of their Sounds of the Neighbourhood for Hotel Indigo - and she told us that the BBC has always been good at supporting local music on the radio.\"Local stations are local to you. They're about our neighbourhood, they're about your news, they're about your stories, they're about your people, they're about the things that are important to you,\" she said.\"That's one of the many things that the BBC does brilliantly - as well as the BBC being this national treasure, it has this real personal connection with each individual community.\"That's where a lot of the music comes from as well, in terms of BBC Introducing - each local station has very intense relationships with the local music scene.\" © Hotel Indigo Edith Bowman thinks Radio X sexism claims are ridiculous: 'They approached me about doing it'Asked about criticism the BBC gets for the popularity of its national music flagship Radio 1, Edith said: \"Radio 1's doing what it's always done... but keeping up with technology and keeping up with the audience it has a licence to appeal to.\"Radio 1 wouldn't have a licence if it didn't attract a certain audience. That's why out of all the BBC national stations it has to regenerate every so often in terms of appealing to a younger audience, because that's its remit.\"If it doesn't fulfil that remit it's not going to get a licence... it appeals to a younger audience and to appeal to a younger audience it has to change and adapt its lineup, its features, its policies.\"I think everyone's very quick to point the finger at the BBC - you never really hear any other station being attacked or threatened in the same way that the BBC does.\"For what the BBC delivers I think it's a shame that it's always a scapegoat for criticism that comes up.\"Edith Bowman is launching Sounds of the Neighbourhood with Hotel Indigo.
