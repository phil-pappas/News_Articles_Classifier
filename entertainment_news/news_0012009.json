I think people might need a break from me.\" \n\"I'm going to hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\" \nTaylor also admitted she is paranoid the world is waiting for her to mess up. \nShe told NME Magazine that she relies on phone calls to her mum to keep her anxiety under control. \n\"I'm in the news every single day for multiple different reasons. \n\"It can feel, at times, if you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up - and then you'll be done. \n\"A lot of the time I need to call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and all the things that matter.\" \nShe's also opened up about a few celebrity rows she's had in the past few years. \nIn July she got into a Twitter exchange in July with Nicki Minaj which started when she thought one of her tweets was an attack. \nShe declined to talk about her recent verbal bust-up with Minaj but revealed she calmed the situation with a text message. \n\"I send text messages now. If there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, I go to someone's management, I get their number and I text them. \n\"It's an important lesson for anyone to learn in 2015.\" \nTaylor says things \"took a while\" to make up with Kanye West but she is on \"such good terms now\" with the rapper. \nKanye infamously took the microphone from her at the 2009 MTV VMAs to say she didn't deserve her award. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:44:02.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
