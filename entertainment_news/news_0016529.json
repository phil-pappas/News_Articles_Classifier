The lease still has to be approved by the city's Department of Zoning and its Plan Commission. \nNonprofit group Friends of the Parks is suing the Chicago Park District to prevent the museum from being built south of Soldier Field. \nCurrent plans for the $400 million project call for a 300,000-square-foot structure with nearly 5 acres of green space. \nConstruction could begin as early as the spring and the museum could be operating by 2019 or 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:46:59.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
