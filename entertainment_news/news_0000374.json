Music at Macungie Institute, 510 E. Main St., Macungie.\nThe venue said in a statement that between low ticket sales and Cox recovering from bronchitis while touring, \"it was best all around to let him have a nights rest before his Maryland dates.\"\n\"Truly our loss,\" the statement said. \"Ronny was sad to cancel as he does love his fans. We are sad to not see him this time through- he is wonderful and honest and one of our favorites for sure.\"\nThe venue said it is working to get refunds to those who bought tickets.\nCox played to a full crowd at Listen Live! Music in 2013.\n“Dueling Banjos” was played in a scene of “Deliverance” that has Cox’s character facing off on guitar against a young banjo-playing mountain boy. The song won the Grammy Award in 1974 for Best Country Instrumental Performance, and “Deliverance” was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nThe movie helped make stars of Burt Reynolds, John Voight and Ned Beatty.\nCox, 76, who made his film debut in that picture, went on to star in more than 35 feature films, including “Taps,” “Beverly Hills Cops,” “RoboCop” and “Total Recall,” as well as significant television roles on “St. Elsewhere” and other shows.\nBut he’s also been a lifelong musician, releasing his first, self-titled album in 1991. He has released nine since. His latest is 2014’s “Ronny Cox Live In Concert – The Official Bootleg.” His 2009 disc “Ronny Cox: Songs with Repercussions,” went to No. 1 on the Folk DJ list.\nThe next concert scheduled at Listen Live! Music, the listening room that offers national and regional music acts, will be soulful singer/songwriter Toby Lightman at 8 p.m. Dec. 19. Tickets, at $20 each, are available at www.listenlivemusic.org or 610-966-6419.\nLightman had the hit “Devils and Angels,” which hit No. 17 in 2003. A year later, her cover of Mary J. Blige’s 1992 hit “Real Love” hit No. 35.\nListen Live! Music also will have its Writers in the Round Concert with Artist-in-Residence Craig Bickhardt with JD Malone, Lizanne Knott and another to be announced, at 8 p.m. Nov. 21. Tickets are $10.", "external_links": ["http://www.listenlivemusic.org/"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:06:12.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
