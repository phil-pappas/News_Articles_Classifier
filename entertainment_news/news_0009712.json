His cult nature remains, however. After all, this was a crowd that roared with approval when a brief clip of B-movie actor Bruce Campbell popped up before Yankovic himself arrived.\nThat arrival saw him making his way into the ABC from outside while singing Pharrell Williams spoof Tacky, a tune off his recent Mandatory Fun album. The record topped the charts Stateside yet failed to make a dent in the UK, but the daftness of Yankovic’s work translates well. This was good, clean and downright silly fun that also served as a pop culture guide of over 35 years, aided by Yankovic’s top notch backing band, who worked their way through genres and acts with ease while donning ridiculous costumes.\nYankovic’s array of changes was impressive, from a fatsuit on Michael Jackson parody Fat to Robin Thicke garb on the lyrically dexterious Word Crimes. The barrage of videos and outfits ensured a rigorously structured feel, which hampered any spontaneity a tad too much, to the extent that technical problems during Perform This Way weren’t acknowledged.\nShare article However the irrepressible energy of Yankovic was hard to resist. Homages like Devo tribute Dare To Be Stupid were hugely enjoyable, and if an acoustic medley faltered then Amish Paradise gloriously celebrated both surrealism and pop smarts.\nThe finale topped the lot, though, with the Star Wars story set to American Pie on The Saga Begins, complete with costumed characters and a huge-sing-a-long. The understanding of how to deliver an entertaining show remains strong in this one.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:14:42.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
