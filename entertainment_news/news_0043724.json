I mean, they were talking to Hitler.\"\nHitler in the film also meets members of the populist-nationalist Alternative for Germany party and the neo-Nazi NPD, while the final scenes show news footage of far-right mobs and a rally by the PEGIDA movement, short for \"Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the Occident\".\nThe release of the movie has touched off broad debate in a country where guilt over World War II and the Holocaust continues to influence political debate.\n\"A fake Hitler, a small moustache clearly helped people lose their inhibitions and... allowed insights into Germany's dark side,\" found the daily Berliner Morgenpost.\nAfter all, it said, Hitler, in a figurative sense, \"never really left\".\n\"The far-right ideology smoulders to this day and has found new forums... in the form of the Alternative for Germany and the PEGIDA movement,\" it said.\nA review by news portal Spiegel Online was more critical: \"Borat with a bar-moustache and side parting: It sounds like a clever flick,\" it said. \"But really it's rather silly.\n\"Because what would be an appropriate response from a passer-by to the Hitler masquerade? It reveals nothing, neither people's indifference nor their hidden sympathies.\"\nTagesspiegel daily pointed out that \"Hitler sells\", in a trend that has been dubbed the “banalisztion of evil” and has turned the monstrous historical figure into something of a commercialized pop icon.\n\"70 years after the end of the 'Third Reich', which left countries destroyed and millions dead, the dictator has shrunk to become a caricature, either loaded with nonsense or with meaning, in books, cinema, TV, Internet,\" it said.\nAt the public premiere Thursday, a Berlin audience roared with laughter during the funnier moments, but quietened during some of the real-life footage.\nOne viewer, who gave her name as Angela, thought \"it was all a bit too forced. The film is playing too hard on the fear about Nazi ideology, and they only picked out the worst sequences.\"\nAnother viewer, Tobias, was more disturbed, given the real-life resurgence of the populist far-right.\n\"This is real,\" he said. \"We need to debate this. It shows how easily people can be manipulated. This is the right moment, because the danger is here now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:07:30.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
