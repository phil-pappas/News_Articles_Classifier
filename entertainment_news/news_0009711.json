I followed the director’s vision. I was asked to kiss my co-star Saanvi and that’s exactly what I did.”\nNewcomer Saanvi doesn’t seem to be as cool about it as Karan though. This was the first time she was kissing on-screen. The young actress took as many as 12 takes to get the scene right. She says, “I was so nervous about the scene. First of all, I haven’t kissed on screen before and this wasn’t just a peck on the cheek but a kiss. I haven’t even told my parents about the scene; I don’t know how they would react. Karan and I are professionals so we had to do what we had to do.”\n Karan Kundra Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum entertainment television Also Read Shah Rukh Khan says that AbRam is a better dancer than him Paul Walker's 'She's All That' to get a remake?
