She was like, 'What's happening? What are you guys doing?' and we were like, 'Oh, we forgot to tell you - the beer's all real and everyone's drunk. It's 10 am, welcome to 'Drinking Buddies.'\" \nMeanwhile, this isn't the first time Olivia has addressed the behind-the-scenes shenanigans as she previously admitted they used alcohol, rather than water, to get an \"organic\" feel. \nShe said two years ago: \"The reason we wanted to drink the beer wasn't to loosen up, it was because we were working within this very specific world in the film, the craft-beer world of Chicago, so we wanted to to improvise accordingly. \n\"And this community had really adopted us, and we were working in an actual brewery. We'd have to pause scenes so a guy in a forklift could carry kegs across the floor.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:11:35.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
