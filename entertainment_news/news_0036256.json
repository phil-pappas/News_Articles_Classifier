Pearson. The groundbreaking novel, which takes place in near future America, has been translated all over the world and has won numerous awards including the prestigious \"Kirkus Best Young Adult Book\" and the \"Golden Kite Honor Award.\" Dolphin Films has also secured the rights to the screenplay adaptation, which was inked by screenwriter Garry Williams ( Larger Than Life, upcoming So B. It ), as well as to the other two novels in the \"Fox Chronicles\" trilogy, Fox Inheritance and Fox Forever . Bill O'Dowd, CEO of Dolphin Films, and Julia Pistor (upcoming Masters of the Universe) will produce. The Adoration of Jenna Fox marks the second film collaboration for O'Dowd and Pistor (upcoming Max Steel , based upon the Mattel action figure). The book is represented by Rosemary Stimola of the Stimola Literary Studio, and film and television rights were handled by Jason Dravis of The Dravis Agency, who has also represented major authors in the YA world including Suzanne Collins ( Hunger Games Trilogy ) and Kate DiCamillo ( Because of Winn Dixie, The Tale of Despereaux). The Adoration of Jenna Fox follows seventeen-year-old Jenna Fox, who has just awoken from a year-long coma caused by a terrible accident, and she doesn't remember anything. Jenna's family gives her old home movies to try and spark a memory, but nothing works. Jenna also can't shake the feeling that something is terribly off. Through Jenna's search for answers, she will discover a shocking secret about herself and her past she never thought possible. \"There aren't many young adult novels with such authentic, fully-formed teen-lead characters that ask such big questions, specifically 'what makes us human,'\" said Bill O'Dowd, CEO of Dolphin Films. \"We've read a lot of good YA work over the years, but Mary Pearson's novels are always a cut above because they are so intelligently written. 'The Adoration of Jenna Fox' may be the smartest YA book we've ever read. And Garry Williams just knocked the script out of the park. This story will definitely stay with you for a long time, and we're excited to bring this amazing novel to the big screen.\" \"The Jenna Fox character is an intriguing protagonist from the not-so-distant future who faces extraordinary challenges, yet she is incredibly relatable to teenagers today,\" said producer Julia Pistor. \"There are a lot of YA stories about self-discovery, but Jenna takes this to a new level as she first needs to figure out who she was before she can move forward and decide who she wants to be. Along the way, she's facing universal themes like love, fear, betrayal and acceptance. While Jenna struggles to piece everything together, she still comes across as completely real and genuine.\" The film is being produced by Dolphin Films and is slated for domestic theatrical release in 2017. Mary Pearson is also currently on the New York Times Bestselling list with Heart of Betrayal ,the second book in her \"Remnant Chronicles\" trilogy.
