For Attahasa, AMR Ramesh, had to go by the Supreme Court order and had to pay Rs 25 lakhs via DD to Muthulakshmi before the film's release. \nIn order to avoid a similar situation, the producers of Killing Veerappan are filing a caveat next week, to protect their own interests. According to our sources, Muthulakshmi is aware of Ramgopal Varma making a film titled Killing Veerappan in three languages but she has neither intefered nor checked the status of the film. \"When Ramgopal Varma had planned to make the film, an agreement was made between the director and Muthulakshmi and the latter had paid some money to Veerappan's wife to use the material. But the agreement has now lapsed. However, they are sure that Muthulakshmi will come back to check on the film and are even expecting a call from her in this regard. So the makers have decided to take the legal route with Killing Veerappan, only to safe guard their film as they don't want any kind of disturbance from Muthulakshmi closer to release date. Even in case of settlement, it will now be done legally,\" explained our source. \nMeanwhile, a grand audio release is planned for the film at Chitradurga, which was initially planned for October 18 and is now going to take place on October 25 after considering Shivarajkumar's health conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:44:28.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
