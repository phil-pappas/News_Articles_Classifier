But as the old adage goes, the best is yet to come.\nThe film's official trailer was released today, aired on US television during a football game and then distributed online via YouTube and the US studio Disney's social media channels.\nStar Wars has released its new look. \nThough it is the third actual trailer released for the film, it is the first official trailer; the two earlier trailers, released last November and in April this year, were considered \"teasers\", though the distinction is sometimes not easy to make.\nAdvertisement Anticipation around the release of the official trailer was so big it had three mini-trailers of its own .\nAnd its release was tied to the release of the film's official poster . \nThe sequential release of trailers is an old Hollywood tradition, though modern studios play a more calculated game in terms of timing and positioning. Disney's most recent mega-blockbuster, Avengers: Age of Ultron , was managed in a similar fashion, with early teasers pitched at franchise fans and then an official trailer premiered during Monday Night Football.\nWhile the football audience is a large one, and, notably, a mainstream one, it is also aired on ESPN, a Disney-owned sports network. By giving ESPN the first look at the trailer the studio is, in effect, looking after its own.\nThe new film has been effectively in play since the US studio Disney acquired George Lucas's production company Lucasfilm in 2012, though the name The Force Awakens was not announced until some time later.\nAs part of that deal, Disney acquired the Star Wars franchise, and has already demonstrated formidable plans for it, announcing a new trilogy, three more standalone films and Star Wars-focused expansions to its billion-dollar theme parks business.\nThe first teaser trailer was released almost a year ago - November 28, 2014. That 88-second teaser - \"There has been an awakening, have you felt it?\" it asked - introduced Finn (John Boyega), BB8, the new-look stormtroopers, Daisy Ridley, Poe Dameron and the cross-bladed lightsaber-wielding Kylo Ren.\nA second two-minute teaser trailer was released on April 16, 2015, at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Los Angeles. It was pitched at the Star Wars heartland, the fans who had loved the franchise since its 1977 debut, and featured glimpses of crashed Star Destroyers, Darth Vader's burned breath mask (complete with a hind of his breath in the soundtrack) and narration from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).\nIt also featured the first proper confirmation that the \"original trilogy\" cast were on board - literally - with a clip featuring Harrison Ford (as Han Solo) and his loyal co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) walking onto the Millennium Falcon.\n\"Chewie we're home,\" Solo said. And then fans were treated to an almost four-minute-long behind-the-scenes video at the annual Comic-Con convention in San Diego.\nThat package featured production artwork, filming miniatures, incomplete action sequences and an extensive look behind the scene, including an interview with Mark Hamill, clips of Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and Anthony Daniels (C3P0) on set and the partially-constructed full-size props of the X-Wing fighter and the Millennium Falcon props.\n\"My whole life has led to this moment,\" actor Simon Pegg said. It was a sentiment echoed by all the cast and, by extension, the Star Wars fans watching. \"It's being done with such love and such enthusiasm from everybody,\" Oscar Isaac said.\nBut Disney is teasing no longer; the trailer released today is the film's first official trailer. And in it fans were treated to the most detailed glimpse into the film's narrative so far.\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens opens in Australia on December 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:30:46.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
