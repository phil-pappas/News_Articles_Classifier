That number is on the letter sent to area customers before a project starts.\nSigning up for WaterAlerts is free, but subscribers might be charged for incoming calls, messages and data on their devices, depending on their service plans.\nbyerak@tribpub.com\nTwitter @beckyyerak\n Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bfd7f/turbine/ct-chicago-water-alerts-1012-biz-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:31:23.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
