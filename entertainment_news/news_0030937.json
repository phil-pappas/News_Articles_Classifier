These diseases can be transmitted from one individual to another through either direct contact or indirect contact. Anti-infective drugs are used to kill (cidal) or stop the growth (static) of infectious agents. Based on the target organism, anti-infective drugs can be categorized into antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic. Anti-infective drugs can act via host defense system or can directly target the causative agent. Infectious diseases such as bacterial infections, respiratory diseases, HPV, and HIV are gradually increasing worldwide. For instance, based on the study of WHO global health observatory (GHO) data, it is estimated that in 2013 34-38 million people suffered from HIV infection worldwide. Infectious diseases increasingly threaten public health and contribute significantly to the rising costs of health care. Infectious disease diagnostic tests help in detecting new pathogens and specific pathogens, monitoring response to therapy, assessing prognosis, and determining appropriate treatment.\n\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global infectious disease diagnostic testing market to grow at a CAGR of 11.48% over the period 2014-2019.\n\nCovered in this report \n\nThe report covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global infectious disease diagnostic testing market for the period 2015-2019.
