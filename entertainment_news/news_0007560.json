Yep, fairly random, yet obviously awesome - this is Bill Murray we are talking about.\nIt's come into fruition though and will be available to view on Netflix on time for this coming yuletide season. Not only that, but Murray has recruited a rake load of stars to take part, including George Clooney, Chris Rock, Miley Cyrus, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Jason Schwartzman, Michael Cera, Rashida Jones, Paul Shaffer, and the band Phoenix\nThe special, entitled A Very Murray Christmas, opens with Murray preparing to host a live, international holiday broadcast. After a blizzard shuts down the production, he makes the best of the situation by singing and celebrating with friends, hotel employees and anyone else who drops by.\nCheck out the trailer below;\nMORE: Watch: Hilarious trailer for Netflix's upcoming 'Wet Hot American Summer', starring EVERYONE\nMORE: Watch: Exclusive trailer for Netflix's new original series 'Narcos', and it looks DEADLY\nMORE: Bojack Horseman is back!
