The play city, which is located at Park Triangle in Bonifacio Global City, allows kids aged 4 to 14 to discover, explore, and learn about the adult world. Kids are given a chance to take on grown-up roles through over 100 immersive role playing activities. A Kidzania staffer explains what kids can do at the play zone \nGiven that kids today live in the age of mobile devices, KidZania has identified ABS-CBN mobile to power up and complement the mobile service factor for their interactive play world. In turn, ABS-CBNmobile tapped homegrown brand CloudFone to provide the devices that will complete this experience. \nNandy Villar, Head of ABSCBN Mobile said, “We are proud to be partners with CloudFone to enrich the experience of kids visiting Kidzania Manila. CloudFone is one of our closest allies in our business. Their vision of providing affordable devices – that are both easy-to-use and durable – is one of the reasons why they are one of the most loved brands by many Filipinos today.” A staff helps her kid choose a cloudfone \nKids visiting Kidzania can expect a whole lot of fun experience using their CloudFone devices. For example, when you avail yourself a handset from the phone shop, you will be able to playback a video that gives you a tour inside the facility. Incidentally, you may also use these mobile phones to watch iWant TV, take photos, or broadcast messages. Visit Kidzania today and let your kids experience a world created just for them.
