Kicking off the show's Citi Concert Series, the singer delivered live renditions of some tracks from her newly-dropped record for the crowd packing New York City's Rockefeller Plaza. Clad in a sexy cut-out jumpsuit, Gomez opened her set with the lead single \"Good for You\" sans collaborator A$AP Rocky . She continued with the second single \"Same Old Love\" as well as a mash-up of \"Come and Get It\" and \"Me & the Rhythm\". In between songs, she chatted with hosts Matt Lauer and Hoda Kotb about her recent revelation that she'd been diagnosed with Lupus. \"To be honest it still kind of makes me a little uncomfortable to talk about it,\" she said. \"But genuinely I feel like I'm able to reach my fans and understand people when I am one-on-one with them, and they're kind of dealing with the same thing because I've been there,\" she continued. \"So I'm just trying to take something that maybe is negative and turn it a positive.\" Gomez's \"Revival\" came out last Friday and is on track to open at No. 1 on Billboard 200 next week. The album has been projected to sell more than 110,000 equivalent albums in the tracking week ending on October 15. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:42:55.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
