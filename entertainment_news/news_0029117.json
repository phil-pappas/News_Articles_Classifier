It is being removed today and returned to the firm as agreed.\nSome local businesses had lobbied to keep the sign in place to help boost tourism, but Carl Hearn, Linkinhorne Parish Council chairman, said officials were concerned about motorists \"stopping in front of the sign in order to have photographs taken.\"\n\"It's really the fact that you don't necessarily want people having children in the road,\" he said. We're just trying to keep the village as safe as we possibly can.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731826", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731826&h=%27Minions%27+sign+at+village+of+same+name+taken+down+amid+picture+safety+concerns", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731826&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:41:40.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
