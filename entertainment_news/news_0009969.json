Stine's books also wins over fellow newcomers 'Bridge of Spies' and 'Crimson Peak'. \n\" Goosebumps \" is the new king of North American box office. The family horror movie spooks other movies, including last week's winner \" The Martian \", to top this week's chart with an estimated $23.5 million in its debut weekend. The opening cume was higher than expectations. \"This movie was a ball to make, and that fun translated to the screen,\" Sony distribution chief Rory Bruer tells TheWrap. \"Our marketing team did a great job of getting the word out that 'Goosebumps' was something different than typical Halloween fare and families got the message.\" The horror movie starring Jack Black as the famous writer R.L. Stine surely took advantage of the upcoming Halloween, being released just two weeks before the festivity. Former champion \"The Martian\" isn't far behind \"Goosebumps\" though, landing on the second spot with additional $21.5 million for a domestic total to $143.8 million. To date, the movie has raked in $319.2 million globally against an estimated budget of $108 million. Another newcomer, \" Bridge of Spies \", debuted at No. 3 with approximately $15.4 million. The drama thriller which marks a third reunion between Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks was released in time for the awards season. \"We had a lot of momentum coming out of the New York Film Festival and conversation about awards,\" says Disney worldwide distribution president Dave Hollis. \"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have been so consistent over the course of time.\" Another horror movie, \" Crimson Peak \", debuted at No. 4 with an estimated $12.8 million. The first weekend's result of the R-rated release from Guillermo del Toro was a big disappointment. Nic Carpou, Universal's domestic distribution president, explains the movie's performance, \"There were a lot of adult titles available, so that was a big challenge.\" Rounding out the top five is another family horror movie, \" Hotel Transylvania 2 \", which has been at the chart for four weeks. The animated film, which is supported by A-list voice cast including Adam Sandler , Selena Gomez , Andy Samberg and Kevin James , adds an estimated $12.2 million for a domestic total of $136.4 million. 1. \" Goosebumps \" - $23.5 million", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:29:50.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
