Learning lessons from the masters like Bob Dylan, James Taylor and Ryan Adams, he likes to keep his songwriting simple and to the point. If your heart is in need of some buttering by a velvet spatula of melodies and tenderness, Sam is your man. \nA relative late-comer to the troubadour profession, Sam began performing live in his mid-20s with occasional open mic appearances for a few years, but once the bug had hit and his confidence grew, he soon gained support slots at The Fleece, Louisiana and Colston Hall for Sandi Thom, James Vincent McMorrow, Scott Matthews and Ward Thomas. \n2015 finds him releasing his debut EP With Hope through Circus City Records. \nThe Sam Eason Live Experience will generally find Sam playing solo with the occasional use of a looping pedal to add layers to his sound, with appearances by his songbird wife to bring the yin to his vocal yang. \nThe Victoria Hall Acoustic Sessions take place on the third Saturday of every month between 7pm and 10pm with doors opening at 6.30pm. \nTo book an open mic slot, e-mail acousticcafe.vh@gmail.com or get in touch via Facebook by searching for 'The Victoria Hall Acoustic Sessions'. \nVisit www.victoriahallradstock.co.uk for further information \nAdmission costs Â£4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:21:48.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
