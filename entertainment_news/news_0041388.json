I believe that he’ll show up to it,” he said. \n“There’ll be letters of provenance by Mr Stallone. These are all added pieces to the puzzle that could take a grey value and make it a lot more than the estimated value.” \nWhile he may be selling the memorabilia, Stallone is continuing the “Rocky” series, which began in 1976, with upcoming film “Creed” set for release next month. \nThe auction will be held Dec. 18-20. A portion of the proceeds will be go to charities for U.S veterans and wounded servicemen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:35:48.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
