(NBC) Mike Hirsch Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call See why testifying in the House of Commons was David Sedaris' biggest mistake. \nThe best way to appreciate David Sedaris is to hear David Sedaris. \nSedaris writes hilariously dark personal essays and short stories. Many of his works are social critiques that measure up with those of America's best humorists such as Mark Twain. \nIt was Sedaris' 1992 radio reading from his \"Santaland Diaries,\" his tale of working as an elf at Macy's in New York, that launched his career. His voice was distinctive and nasally. And man, could he tell a wickedly funny story. \nI love listening to Sedaris read his work, whether on the public radio show \"This American Life\" or through audio versions of his best-selling collections such as \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" and \"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.\" \nYou can hear Sedaris read some of his new works on Thursday. He's coming to Easton's State Theatre for a lecture, followed by a Q&A. He'll also sign copies of his books before and after the performance. \nI recently had a chance to catch up with Sedaris. I called the 58-year-old at his home in rural West Sussex, England, where he lives with his longtime partner, Hugh. He was talkative, thoughtful and funny. \nQ: It seems that many of your stories have a foundation of being a stranger in a strange land. Like when your family moved when you were a child from New York to Raleigh. Do you think that's true? \nA: Probably. When we moved from New York state to Raleigh, that was the first time that I guess I was an outsider. And it was pretty clear once you opened your mouth. You were easily identified as one. And it's interesting that's pretty much my life today. \nSomebody just said to me yesterday, \"Oh, I love your accent.\" I thought, \"Heck, I don't have an accent, you do. It's not me.\" But I am the American here. London has a 39 percent immigrant population, so everyone is a foreigner in London. You can go all day without speaking to an English person. But where we are now in Sussex, everybody's English. It's kinda nice. You get to feel special. I'm the one with the accent. \nBut I've always liked that. When I go back to the United States, like when I go back for a tour, there is a certain pleasure in understanding the way things work, understanding what to do and why people do what they do. Even when you don't like it, you get it in a way. Whereas here, even though they speak English, I'm constantly scratching my head. Just the same way I was in France. \nBut I like that. You know I went to Copenhagen earlier this summer, and I went to Greece, and I don't know, I just love being the [outsider]. Because when it's your own country, I think often you don't notice how odd things are. When you live amongst it. \nBut when I went to Copenhagen earlier this summer, it just became illegal to have sex with animals in Denmark. I said, What ? This past year, it became illegal. And I said, Was everybody just doing it before? I mean, everybody thought it was bad and stuff but I guess they had other things to legislate on. And once they crossed the big things off their list, I guess they thought: What about people who, like, [have sex with] cats? \nQ: I never thought about bestiality with cats before. Until this moment. It seems like it would be difficult. \nA: (laughs) It's those claws, man. \nQ: What do you miss about America? \nA: I miss canned clams. They don't have them here. And they didn't have them in France either. The only place I've ever seen them is in the United States. \nWith the Internet, you can read your hometown paper, you can listen to your hometown radio station. So there's really not that much to miss. I miss ... there's a level of enthusiasm that you get in the United States you don't get in other places. A level of ... optimism. And sometimes it just goes haywire and it creates monsters. But there's a level of it that most Americans tend to have. Like here in England, god forbid you ever say anything good about yourself or you ever admit anything good about yourself. You constantly have to talk about how ugly you are, how useless your are, how stupid you are. \nQ: You know who I think embodies optimism well is your sister Amy in some of her characters like in the movie \"Elf\" and now on the TV show \"Alpha House.\" Is she really upbeat like that? \nA: No, and that's why I find it kind of disturbing to watch her on TV. I mean she's a lovely person and she's very encouraging. And she's not stingy with her enthusiasm or with her laughter. But on TV, it's kind of this heightened like super-peppy version of it. It's a few notches above. You know you always have to be bigger. That's what I don't like about TV, you have to amp all that stuff up. \nQ: I read that 2014 was your summer of the Fitbit. What was your focus this year? \nA: Apple Watch. Somebody gave me an Apple Watch, and then you need a phone in order to make it work. So I had to get a phone. I never had one. The only thing I used it for was to make my watch work. So now I have an Apple Watch on one wrist and a Fitbit on the other one. Because there are minor discrepancies. According to my Fitbit, so far today I've walked 18.5 miles. And according to my watch, I've walked 19.2. \nQ: I would follow your watch then. \nA: Yeah (laughs). But I'm completely a maniac. I'm going to pace around while we do the interview. Cause, goddamn it, I'm gonna end the day at 20 miles. Now it's 11:40 at night here. And then after we get off the phone I'm going to go out with my flashlight and walk three miles. Earlier this summer, I set a new record for myself. I walked 30.4 miles. 70,000 steps. And that took 11 1/2 hours. \nQ: What will you be reading on this book tour? \nA: I don't know. Well, I'll have a story that I had in The New Yorker last week. Generally, it's not a book tour but a lecture tour. So I just read out loud. I usually go out with maybe four new stories and I read things out loud and see how they work. And I go back to the hotel room and rewrite them and read them and rewrite them. \nI printed out yesterday a story I wrote about 10 years ago that had to do with Halloween. And I thought, OK, well maybe. I normally don't read old things. I can see how audiences would want to hear things they've heard before. But I feel that if I do that, they're going to look at me and say, \"Haven't you done anything ?\" And also it gives me an opportunity to fix things and to make a story better. \nQ: My brother's family listens to \"Santaland Diaries\" every year and my family listens to \"Six to Eight Black Men\" every year. Is is strange to be part of people's Christmas traditions? \nA: Yeah. I mean, it didn't occur to me that would ever happen. That said, I like the idea of other people reading my stuff out loud. I think that's lovely, to read out loud as a family. \nQ: I'm in my 50s and I relate to your pieces where you're confused and amused by your father. Is he still a source of material for you? \nA: Yeah. My dad is 94. And so when I came home tonight I had a message on the machine. And that doesn't happen too often. And I thought, \"OK, my father's dead. Well I guess that works out OK because I'm just going to go to the United States anyway for my tour.\" But it was just somebody calling about delivering some furniture. \nHe's been in great shape. But I dropped in on him. I was in North Carolina over the summer. And so I called many times to tell him I was going to come by and drop this stuff off. And he never answered the phone, and I just got his machine. So I thought, \"OK, my father's dead.\" Hugh and I went in. I thought it's going to be strange to be the one to find his body. And I spent a week at the medical examiner's office, and I know what that's like. So I thought, \"I'm just going to open the door and if it smells bad, I'm just going to call the police.\" \nMy father was in the kitchen. And he just hadn't listened to his answering machine. He wanted to show Hugh, my boyfriend, a painting. And he said, \"It's just in the hall.\" And he grabs a flashlight and walks into the hall. It's daytime and he shines a flashlight on this painting. And I said, \"Dad are the lights out?\" And he said, \"No.\" He's doing it to save money. And then the house must have been 90 degrees. It was probably 100 outside. So I guess he set the air conditioner on 90. \nYeah, but one of the stories I just wrote this summer to read on the tour is about my dad. I had a story in The New Yorker last year about basically my father waited until he was about 90 to become nice. But I've got to hand it to him. He's a really nice guy now. But he just waited until he was 90. But when you weren't so nice before, it doesn't just work. Say you turn 90 and then you have an amazing relationship with everybody that you just weren't nice to for the first 90 years (laughs). \nI mean I'll be in a room with my dad and I'll think, \"What can I talk about, what can I say to him?\" Whereas with my mother, I never thought about it. There was just always stuff to talk about. It was hard not to talk to her. I think a lot of that is father and son stuff, which really hasn't changed. I was listening to \"Death of a Salesman\" recently. And it's such a timeless play about that father and son relationship. It was so fresh. He really put his finger on that. \nAnd my father I've got to say, he's a really good sport. I've written a lot of stuff about my dad over the years. Sometimes when there's a question and answer at a reading, people will be like, \"Oh my god I can't believe your family even talks to you.\" But I think it's pretty clear that I'm writing about people who I love. I think that's clear. But a lot of people, unless you say, [in singsong voice] \"I love you,\" then you don't think you love somebody. But we don't talk like that in my family. You spend $800 on somebody's Christmas present, that means I love you. You don't have to go around saying it. \nQ: Have you had a strange fan encounter lately? \nA: Well, I'm on the radio here in England. I'm on the BBC Radio 4. I think I just finished my sixth series. And I talked about picking up rubbish in one of the essays. And so now I get stopped pretty much every day. Somebody will pull over while I'm picking up rubbish on the side of the road. \nAnd so this woman stopped the other day. She came by and was very kind and said she liked my writing and it was very nice. But the problem was that we were then walking in the same direction but she was just walking 10 feet in front of me. And I wasn't sure how far she was going, and it felt like I should catch up with her and I should walk her to her car. It was just weird. You know how that is when you see somebody ... in any kind of situation like that even if you know someone and you say hello and it turns out you're walking in the same direction. But no one said, Let's walk together [chuckles]. It was just awkward. \nAnd I got invited to testify in the House of Commons about rubbish. And it was the biggest mistake I ever made. Because there was an MP [Member of Parliament] there. I was questioned by a group of members of Parliament. It didn't occur to me that anyone could be for rubbish, you know. But you know how politicians, like with the Planned Parenthood hearings that went on the other day. It's just an opportunity for these people to get up there and give little speeches so they can have a sound bite that plays back in their home community. Of them being outraged about something. But I've never been in that before. I never had that happen to me before. \nAnway, the whole thing just blew up in my face. This MP tweeted during this thing that David Sedaris just said the poor are responsible for rubbish. I never said that. I was talking about the rubbish that I find on the side of the road. And I said like for every 10 Tesco bags I might find one Waitrose bag. Those are names of supermarkets. And Waitrose is like slightly more expensive than Tesco. And to people here, because everything is about class all the time, they act like if you go to Waitrose, \"Ooh, who do you think you are?\"\"You must think: You're posh, aren't you?\" I mean, shut up . A can of peas is 7 cents more expensive. Shut up. \nAnd then I did a BBC interview that night: Can we talk about your controversial statements regarding the poor? And it was on the front page of the local paper: Blame it on the poor! And I never even said that. \nAnd so for awhile I'd be out there picking up trash and people would drive by and then they'd say, Oh I saw you on the telly. And I thought, well eventually, all they'll remember is that they saw me on television. They won't remember why. It's just one of those things, I thought, OK we'll just have to get through it. I learned a lesson. \nBut then I got invited to Buckingham Palace. Because of rubbish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:11:47.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
