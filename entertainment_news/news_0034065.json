Related Content 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens': What we know \nThe film is set decades after \"Return of the Jedi.\" And as the trailer shows, the younger characters aren't sure the stories about the Jedi are real. Han assures them everything they've heard is true. \nMeanwhile, Kylo Ren is set on finishing what Darth Vader started (one would guess that means wiping out any vestiges of the Jedi at least). \nDirector J.J. Abrams prefaced the trailer with a note to fans: \"I don't care if you're black, white, brown, Jawa, Wookiee, Jedi or Sith. I just hope you like it!\" \nLike the other \"Force Awakens\" trailers, fans across the board raved about the trailer, which is sure to be dissected frame by frame in the hours to come. \nThe reaction was so rapturous (combined with some frustration about ticket difficulties) that it was a very unique night to be a \"Star Wars\" fan, with many comparing it to the feelings they felt seeing the original trilogy. \nWatch it here: it's your last big look at the movie until December 18, 2015. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
