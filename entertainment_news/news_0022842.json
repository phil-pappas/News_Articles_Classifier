Also among her works was an autobiography entitled “ The Joy of the Snow .” Delving deeper into Goudge’s life, author Christine Rawlins explores Goudge’s career and personal life in her new book, “ Beyond the Snow : The Life and Faith of Elizabeth Goudge” (published by WestBow Press).\n“Beyond the Snow” is an appreciation of Goudge’s life and work that attempts to look beyond her autobiography. It attempts to compile a chronological biography of what she told readers of her life. It examines in particular her Christian faith and its influence on who she was and what she did. Rawlins pulls from her correspondence, her books and the recollections of family and friends.\nPraise for “Beyond the Snow”:\n“This is a much needed study of a remarkable life. Elizabeth Goudge was not only a sensitive and acute artist in fiction, but a profoundly insightful commentator on the processes of growing up spiritually and morally. She fully deserves the kind of sympathetic and appreciative exploration provided by this book.”\n–Rowan Williams, 104th Archbishop of Canterbury\n“I want readers to walk away with a deeper knowledge of her life and an appreciation of the greatness of her achievement,” Rawlins says. “Not just as a romantic novelist, but as one of the most important Christian writers of the 20th century.”\n“Beyond the Snow”\nBy Christine Rawlins\nHardcover | 6 x 9 in | 548 pages | ISBN 9781490886190\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 548 pages | ISBN 9781490886183\nE-Book | 548 pages | ISBN 9781490886176\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nChristine Rawlins has previously compiled the faith anthology “ A Vision of God ,” which included first publication of seven poems by Elizabeth Goudge.
