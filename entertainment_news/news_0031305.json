February 3rd 2011 /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/Music/ \nA MUSICAL featuring tunes by Aussie rockers INXS has moved a step closer to Broadway. \nChris Murphy — the band’s manager from 1980 to 1995, who returned in 2008 — is in talks with a director to take on the project, the New York Post reports. \nMurphy said that when he repped the band in the ’80s, “they just did what they were feeling at the time.” \nWhen they brought in funk bassist Nile Rodgers to produce a 1983 single, Original Sin , their label said, “What the [bleep] is this?” Murphy recalled. “They were absolutely furious.” \nBut, “All these years later, the negative has been turned into a positive. A lot of bands have a sound, and they just keep to it ... It’s monotone. The depth of [INXS’] catalogue is quite unique.” Michael Hutchence ... iconic INXS frontman in London in 1990.
