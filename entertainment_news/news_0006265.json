So far to me it’s either been too low or too screechy up here. It just saddens me, that’s all.”\nX Factor: Who do you most want to save this week? Isaak was also confused by the choice of song for Denton.\n“I think it’s great to see you performing better and better every week, but I don’t think this song was my favourite for you — I don’t think it suited your voice well,” he said.\nThe tension between Minogue and Blunt spilt on to social media with the hash tag ding ding trending online.\nTonight, two contestants will be eliminated from the competition, a first for the Australian franchise.
