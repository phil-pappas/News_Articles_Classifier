Their contribution is so much that it is only natural that they would leave an impact on your singing. Since I was born in a musical family, I had the opportunity to meet MS amma on several occasions. There are a lot of things that fascinate you about her, but I personally love the emotions and bhavams in her music. Her vocal dynamics is something that I have always admired. She had attended some of my kutcheris, and I have even got awards from her when I was a child, where she was present as the chief guest.\nThough I'd met her several times, I remember one incident when her daughter, Vijaya maami, took me to her home during Navaratri. Vijaya maami had heard me sing Giridhara Gopala (the song that MS sang for her film Meera) at one of the concerts. She had asked me to sing it in front of MS amma. I was so scared to sing that particular song as MS had made the song famous with her profound rendition (the song is famous even today). But she didn't let me go without singing. Even though I was nervous, it was like a million-dollar opportunity for me to sing her song in front of her. I still remember how keenly she listened to my rendition.\nShe always spoke to me with so much love and warmth. She used to say, \"You're not only Pattammal's granddaughter, but also my granddaughter.\" She treated me in the same manner and constantly advised me on how I should take care of my voice. She suggested that I take warm liquids, so that my voice strengthened and asked me to take utmost care to preserve my voice.\nEven though MS and DK amma were contemporaries, it was extremely special to see them together. They always had mutual respect for each other and shared a great friendship. They used to meet each other often. Pattamal paati used to say wonderful things about her. She used fondly recollect the time when they both released the record, Yaro Ivar Yaro, around the same time. Both the records were sensational hits. What was heartening is that they both respected each others' music. I am glad that I have memories with both these legends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:26:23.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
