We cannot use Photoshop in this shoot'.\" \nDemi has been very vocal about her past struggles with addiction, self-harm and eating disorders, and during the photoshoot she avoided feeling too embarrassed by thinking about helping the magazine's readers feel proud of their body shape. \n\"Of course it's awkward,\" she noted. \"But when I start to think about the message, when I would start to think about how many people this would inspire, I got more comfortable doing it.\" \nDemi has previously shared insight into her fitness regime, insisting she loves to stay in trim for the physical benefits and because engaging in regular exercise helps keep her head straight. \n\"During each one of my training sessions, I focus on lengthening and toning for the bottom half of my body; that means lots of squats and lunge variations to keep my glutes and hips strong and lean,\" she told the British edition of Women's Health magazine. \n\"I keep my core strong with planks, crunches, push-ups, lying glute push-ups and bridges. This strengthens my body and helps prevent injury when I'm performing on stage. Your core is your power center.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:31:52.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
