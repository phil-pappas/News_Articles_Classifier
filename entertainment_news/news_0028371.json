Rihanna won best female performer while Nicki Minaj took best hip hop. One Direction won for best pop group, preventing Bieber from sweeping all the awards for which he was nominated. \nNone of those acts were on hand to accept, and only Minaj sent along a \"thank you\" video. \nBest video went to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, who opened the show with their award-winning song Downtown , with Eric Nally flying against a full moon backdrop. They thanked fans for supporting their music without the backing of a big label. \nPharrell Williams closed out the ceremony, singing a rousing rendition of his anthem Freedom with dancers in brightly coloured swing skirts. \nAs the broadcast wrapped up, cameras cut to the Piazza Duomo in Milan's center, where fans unfurled a huge \"Freedom\" banner to raise awareness about Europe's refugee crisis. \nNew Wave rockers Duran Duran were honoured with the first-ever MTV video visionary award honouring music video pioneers. \n\"Music lovers around the world, when we started, there was us and MTV, and we blazed a trail and we were there for each other,\" Simon Le Bon told the crowd. \nGlobal categories: \nConceived as an alternative to the MTV Video Music Awards aimed at international fans, North American stars nonetheless have often dominated the European edition, whose venue changes each year. \nAndrea Bocelli made his MTV EMA debut, lulling the Italian crowd into a sing-along of his hit Con te partiro before singing a duet with best newcomer nominee Tori Kelly. \n\"It's been such an honour just to be around him and just see how he works and it's really cool to see his wife and kids,\" Kelly said on the red carpet. \nHere is the full list of winners: \nBest Song: Taylor Swift ft.
