The organisation teaches all aspects of filmmaking from development to production and culminates with the students producing a seven to 10 minute short film. The judges will have the final decision on awards, including Best Film, which includes an internship with Image Nation. \nThis year saw the Arab Film Studio programme expand with a new subdivision to give filmmakers in the region further opportunities to hone their skills. Arab Film Studio Docs launched earlier this year and crowned Emirati filmmaker, Amena Al Nowais, the winner. Since then, Al Nowais has been working on some of Image Nation's biggest projects, including Davis Guggenheim's He Named Me Malala - set for theatrical release in the UAE on November 5. \nThe winners will be announced at an award ceremony next month. \nFor more details on how to apply to next year's competition, visit www.arabfilmstudio.com Advertisement Copyright Â© 2015 Khaleej Times.
