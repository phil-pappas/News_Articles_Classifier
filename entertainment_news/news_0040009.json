Amit Mishra is spinning the ball occasionally. India should make most of the little pressure created here by harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra. David Miller Out! Harbhajan Singh scalps first wicket here. Looking to go over cover, Miller plays it towards the backward point. Much needed wicket for India. D Miller c Rahane b Harbhajan 33(41). Hashim Amla walks out to bat. Never underestimate the power of a soon to be married common man. #Bhajji #INDvSA \n— Vikas Wadhawan (@vickywadhawan83) October 18, 2015 Live Score South Africa 71/0 after 13 Overs: Quinton de Kock 36 | David Miller 33 Four! Top-edge and the ball flies past lone slip towards the boundary. Six runs from this over.

Also Catch- India vs South Africa 3rd ODI 2015 live scorecard & ball by ball commentary Live Score South Africa 64/0 after 11 Overs: Quinton de Kock 35 | David Miller 27 Another change in bowling and Amith Mishra is into the attack. There is a hint of spin for him. A loose delivery from him and Quinton de Kock lashes onto it to earn a boundary. Mishra responded well after that boundary and ends the over with three dot balls. Live Score South Africa 59/0 after 10 Overs: Quinton de Kock 31 | David Miller 26 So at the end of ten overs, South Africa’s scoring rate is just under six runs per over. This is a good start for South Africa; yes the wicket is flat but you still need to get your head down. Live Score South Africa 54/0 after 9 Overs: Quinton de Kock 31 | David Miller 21 Bhuvneshwar Kumar concedes two back to back boundaries against Quinton de Kock. There is absolutely nothing in the pitch for bowlers. Single brings David Miller back on strike. A quick single to end the over, ten runs came from this over. 50 up for SA without the loss of any wickets. Good start here. I can sense the run flow here. #INDvSA \n— Debasish Sahoo (@dudul98) October 18, 2015 Live Score South Africa 44/0 after 8 Overs: Quinton de Kock 22 | David Miller 18 And yes, Harbhajan Singh comes in as first change. This should be interesting. Starts with couple of dot balls. Three singles and a double on last ball amke it five from Harbhajan’s first over. Live Score South Africa 39/0 after 7 Overs: Quinton de Kock 20 | David Miller 17 Four through off-side for Quinton de Kock. Good start to the over for South Africa. Just a single afterwards as David Miller fails to find gap. Harbhajan Singh is warming; looks like he will be brought into the attack next. Live Score South Africa 34/0 after 6 Overs: Quinton de Kock 15 | David Miller 17 After couple of dot balls, Miller punched one through on-side for a boundary. This is good bowling by Mohit Sharma, keeping it tight against Miller after conceding the boundary. Just four from this over. Live Score South Africa 30/0 after 5 Overs: Quinton de Kock 15 | David Miller 13 Both DeKock and Miller are running well between the wickets and looking to convert singles into twos and even threes. Six! De Kock finishes the over in style. It was bowled on his legs and he flicked it over fine leg for a six. It just landed couple of inches behind the boundary rope. Live Score South Africa 20/0 after 4 Overs: Quinton de Kock 6 | David Miller 12 Mohit Sharma with his second over looked more settled than Bhuvi. Quinton de Kock is shuffling in the crease to counter the bit of swing Mohit is generating. Four! Classic cover drive to end the over. South Africa are slowly getting into the groove here. Live Score South Africa 12/0 after 3 Overs: Quinton de Kock 5 | David Miller 5 After good first over, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was bit wayward in his second over. He is bowling over the wicket to Miller and round the wicket to de Kock, may be that is making it bit difficult for him to adjust. Seven runs from this over. Live Score South Africa 5/0 after 2 Overs: Quinton de Kock 4 | David Miller 1 It is Mohit Sharma with the new ball from other end and David Millers pushes it towards leg-side to open his account. Four, classic shot that from Quinton de Kock’s bat. And the ball races past extra-cover fielder. De Kock is off the mark as well. Good comeback by Mohit Sharma bowls four dot balls to end the over. Live Score South Africa 0/0 after 1 Over: Surprise, surprise it is David Miller walking out to open the innings with Quinton de Kock. So Hashim Amla possibly drops to number three. And for India it is Bhuvneshwar Kumar to start the proceedings. Good start this for Bhuvi, starts off with a maiden over. Toss Report: South African captain AB de Villers won the toss and without hesitation opted to bat first. South Africa have fielded an unchanged side for this game. On the other hand, MS Dhoni said, they were looking to bat first as well, but with dew expected later things will get easier for team batting side. As expected Amit Mishra is back for this game and this means Umesh Yadav misses out today. Read the detailed toss and playing XI report here. Pitch Report: Well, as expected the pitch at Rajkot is a flat track and batsmen will be licking their lips to go out there and smash the bowlers. Both Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme Smith are of the opinion that it is going to be runs runs and runs today at Rajkot.
