Morse is most known for inventing Morse code, a system of long and short tones used for communicating by telegraph. He was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts and attended Yale University, but was an indifferent student. He was very interested in discussions on electricity but after graduation he decided to pursue a career as a portrait painter and painted many important portraits. Later, Morse overheard a conversation about the newly discovered electromagnet. By hearing this conversation, Morse conceived the idea of the telegraph. During the next few years Morse exhibited his telegraph before savants, businessmen and committees of Congress, hoping to find the funds to give his telegraph a large-scale test. He met considerable skepticism that any message could really be sent from city to city over wire. But in May of 1844 Morse sent the first formal message over telegraph from Washington D.C. to Baltimore, Maryland. The first message he sent was, \"What Hath God Wrought!\" Many believed that he chose this verse due to his own amazement that God had chosen him to reveal this invention to mankind...
