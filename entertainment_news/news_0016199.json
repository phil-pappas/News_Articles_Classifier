I’ve always been a supporter of BBC Children In Need, but to meet some of the young people who are directly benefiting from everyone’s support really brings new meaning to the cause.” Thank you to everyone who joined us for the @BBCCountryfile @BBCCiN #ramble #windsorpark a very special joy filled day @Gleb_Savchenko \n— anita rani (@itsanitarani) October 11, 2015 \nHer ramble followed her fellow presenters’ walks over the weekend, which saw Matt Baker taking on a five-mile scramble up Tryfan in Snowdonia with 30 viewers, including 18-year-old visually impaired fan Ella.

Whether with family or friends, you’ll find all the details on the Countryfile website, and will be helping make a real difference to young lives in the UK.” Share article \nThe special Children In Need episode of Countryfile will air on BBC One on November 1.
