But it's the star that makes it a mirthless trudge, bereft of a smirk or elbow in the ribs or any indication that a story about an 800-year-old immortal guy who hound-dogs witches in the modern world maybe shouldn't be taken seriously.\nOf course, the more poker-faced Diesel is, the funnier the movie gets, unintentionally. Such is the irony of performance - the harder you try to be funny, the less funny you are, and the harder you try to be serious, the funnier you are. Intention rarely plays a role.\nIn a performance that's like day-old bread – dry, stiff, crusty – Diesel plays Kaulder, the title hero. Several centuries ago, he and a group of beards and scars and swords clomped their boots across a Siberian plain to a giant gnarled tree, where dwelled the Witch Queen, who brought the black plague to the world. Kaulder confronts the villainess, who has surrounded them both with a ring of CGI fire: \"TODAY, WE BOTH DIE,\" Kaulder says, showing he has nothing to lose because his wife and daughter are dead. He impales the Witch Queen with his flaming sword, but before she expires, she shrieks, in an \"Evil Dead\" possession-voice, \"I CURSE YOU WITH LIFE!\" and there's a whoosh of special-effects nonsense to punctuate the irony as he un-dies.\nFILM REVIEW 'The Last Witch Hunter'\n1½ stars (out of 4)\nMPAA rating: PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images\nCast: Vin Diesel, Rose Leslie, Elijah Wood, Michael Caine\nDirector: Breck Eisner\nRun time: 106 minutes\nCut to the present day, where Kaulder lives in a New York City penthouse with marble walls, where he wards off his loneliness by bringing in the occasional stewardess for a little schtupping. When he isn't hunting witches, he builds watches, because that's what movie characters do when they're immortal and therefore obsessed with time's passage. We double-take upon hearing the inimitable Michael Caine via voiceover - \"For 800 years he has served the axe and cross,\" is a particularly amusing chunk of his thankless narration - and the British actor eventually manifests physically as Dolan 36th, a priest who acts as Kaulder's handler and confidant. When Caine and Diesel share a scene, the dialogue exchange is like an oratory competition between a songbird and a gym mat, and I hope I don't need to explain who is which.\nDolan 36th has been pals with Kaulder for 50 years, and he's on the verge of retiring to a less chaotic life. \"WE TOOK OUT SOME NASTY COVENS,\" Kaulder reminisces fondly. Of course, the desire to get out of the business of lassoing evil \"14th-level warlocks\" and whatnot is how crap movies foreshadow doom, so it's not long before Kaulder is ID-ing the old man's body, and working with Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) to avenge him.\nWood is saddled with a character who needs to prove himself, so the trio of screenwriters – I feel the need to protect them by not naming them – shoves exposition in his speaking-hole, saddling him with the nigh-endless explanation of arbitrary rules-of-magic dictating the action in this underworld. This allows Diesel to pick up various artifacts and make proclamations – my favorite: \"Burial dirt!\" – proving Kaulder has spent his 800 years not only doing pull-ups and dead-lifts, but sniffing herb gardens and dipping his pinky in alchemical potions.\nAlong the way, Kaulder picks up a young not-evil witch, Chloe (\"Game of Thrones\" veteran Rose Leslie), who nudges out Dolan 37th as his sidekick, because at that point, the movie desperately needed a female presence that isn't a screech-monster with centipedes crawling out of holes in her face. We will learn that Chloe is a \"dreamwalker\" at the most opportune time Kaulder needs her to walk through a dream. He senses the use of \"dark magic\" in all the whatnot that's going on; it's \"beyond evil,\" he says, so we assume they will eventually need to save the world from cold, chaotic destruction for the sake of cold, chaotic destruction, and that this will all need to get very, very noisy before it ends.\nAnd so it gets very, very noisy, as it must. It also rarely makes a lick of sense. \"The Last Witch Hunter\" is an assemblage of sequences featuring visually incomprehensible fighting or scenes in which characters fruitlessly attempt to explain what just happened, and/or why they happened. They're strung together with Dieselgrunting, the common element in a film that's tragically witless, and tries with all its might to be no fun whatsoever. Its best hoot of a moment is not when Diesel attempts to be emotive by squinting, but when Kaulder explains how he, being incapable of death, is afraid of nothing. \"It's boring, really,\" he says of the absence of fear in his life, and that's where the accidentally reviews itself, as all the best bad movies inevitably do.\nJohn Serba is film critic and entertainment reporter for MLive and The Grand Rapids Press.
