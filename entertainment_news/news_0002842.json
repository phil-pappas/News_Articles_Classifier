All of them feel a tremendous loyalty to the franchise and they want to better themselves,\" says Broccoli. \n\"Not to mention at the helm, Sam Mendes, who wants to make this even better than Skyfall . Image caption The Spectre plot involves \"a cryptic message from Bond's past\" \n\"And our gorgeous Daniel Craig, who is at the heart and soul of this whole franchise and is leading the charge, wants to make the best film possible,\" she added. We met the gadget man \nChris Corbould says his career actually began when he was 16, just after his exams and he was asked to go and work on the set of a film called Tommy. \nHe said: \"I was caught by the bug, never went back to school and started learning engineering.\" \nHis team do all the gadgets on all the Bond cars. Remember when the tube crashed on Skyfall? Yep, he did that too. \nCorbould showed us a helicopter, which was being winched up on wires and launched across the set. Image caption Ralph Fiennes as M, taking over after Judy Dench was killed off in Skyfall \n\"For various reasons, sometimes we shoot scenes out of sequence. \n\"We've actually crashed the helicopter and now they are going back to a scene prior to the helicopter crashing.\" \nAnd he admitted it's not always easy to live up to the script. \n\"I have to go away and I get all my guys in a huddle and we talk about it and nine times out of 10, we go for it. \n\"The Bond franchise has a history of doing things for real, so, hence we crash it for real.\" We talked to the man 'trying to top Skyfall' \nDennis Gassner says he's \"the architect of the film\" and his job is to create all the environments for the actors. \n\"The question that I have generally is 'what's the story and how do we go about doing it?' And Sam would say something like 'can you find me something hot and cold'? Image caption Sam Mendes said he took on Spectre for \"the second part of a crucial story of Bond's childhood\" \n\"It's like a piece of music: it has to flow, it has to feel right, it has to have its crescendos, its false crescendos, its movements. \nGassner has a room on set where every scene is planned out across a wall with pictures - but of course Grimmy wasn't allowed in there. \nHe says his job is like puzzle making, to find the best \"pieces\" to present to fans. \n\"We're really trying to top Skyfall, that's what we're really doing and that was really the basics of the job. That's like saying 'how do we top ourselves' and is also probably the hardest thing we could do.\" We met the woman behind the suits \nJany Temime says day one was \"M's office in Pinewood, that's how we started.\" She also revealed she was nervous because it was Daniel's first suit. \n\"It was a new suit, it was a new shape. But boy, after the first day, it's every day,\" she joked. Image caption Grimmy with costume designer Jany Temime in a 007 dressing room \nShe walked Grimmy through Daniel Craig's dressing room, which included the clothes for his stunt doubles. \nAnd she revealed that sometimes the star says he won't wear certain costumes. \n\"Of course he does. Every actor does... \n\"And then you say 'why not?' and then you say 'OK', and then you give him what he wants, because he has to play the part. \n\"Daniel is extremely sexy, beautiful, charming, so it's a pleasure to make him look good and he looks good. He looks even better without the suit,\" she laughed. \nShe says she makes the same outfit in different ways, including thing like reinforcements, for the action scenes. Image caption Sam Mendes said he took on Spectre for \"the second part of a crucial story of Bond's childhood\" \nShe says if you want to get into the industry \"you have to be completely mad to work 80 hours a week and you have to love film\". We talked to the stunt boss \nGary Powell says his job \"is having lots of fun\" and \"coming up with a lot of the action, training the actors and getting the right stunt team in\". \nIt's his seventh Bond and he says the hardest bit of his job is being sent away from his family for months on end. Image caption This is Grimmy getting to watch a little bit of Spectre being filmed \nThis time he says the best stunt was with the cars, the Austin Martin DB10 and Jaguar CX75. \nThere was half of an Austin Martin on set for interior shots, Gary explained. He revealed they use the Top Gear track for tests and Daniel Craig can get around that \"really quick\". \n\"We had an amazing time with two cars, basically built from the ground up, for us to do what we were doing in them. \n\"So it was a real privilege to be in something that only a real handful of people have driven.\" \nAnd is there a lot of pressure to make sure that stunt looks good? Gary said \"just a little bit\". \nSpectre is released on 26 October \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:28:10.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
