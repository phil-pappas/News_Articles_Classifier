A Democratic leadership aide, who was not authorised to speak publicly, said on condition of anonymity that the agency has not yet consulted with the lawmakers.\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, held a book signing Monday in Austin, Texas, where he told reporters, \"I don't feel the need for it, quite frankly, but the Secret Service thinks that I need it, so it is what it is\".\nThe requests come months before the Republicans and the Democrats name their presidential nominees, and more than a year before Election Day. But both candidates have made controversial remarks about ethnic and religious minorities, and are drawing large and unpredictable crowds. Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, while Carson has said he would not be comfortable with a Muslim president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:07:15.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
