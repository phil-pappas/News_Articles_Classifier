MC was sympathetic to FH’s concern and promised to do what she could to help FH secure her spot.\nSo, MC approached the production and hinted that she will leave the show if FH is removed. The statement was simple, yet crucial, because MC has a huge following and her departure will certainly stir intrigue.\nWill MC stand in the way of improving the show, or will the network do what it intends and say “bye” to MC?\n(Illustration by Rod Cañalita)\nViewers, stay put and pass around the popcorn…\n“There are two kinds of idiots – those who don’t take action because they have received a threat, and those who think they are taking action because they have issued a threat.” – Paulo Coelho\n• • •\nJust wait?\nIf the network (TN) does not take notice, several of its top talents might just say sayonara to them. These talents are beginning to think that TN is not giving them the attention – and they could be right.\nWhen one of the projects of Versatile Actress (VA) had its run, she was disappointed at the lack of support from TN. VA felt TN was so preoccupied with a Prized Love team (PL), that her project was left out. VA was so disappointed that she has entertained thoughts of moving. Allegedly, VA has already sent feelers to the rival station, where she hopes to be treated better.\nAs TN seems too focused on PL, the promotion given to some of the talents has suffered. As a result, some of the seasoned ones are already disgruntled.\nWell, at these times when celebrity newbies are dime a dozen, TN has a long line of raw talents waiting to be propelled into fame. Moving to another station and starting from scratch will be such a risk and there really is no guarantee that she will get better treatment. Transferees will always be second in line unless they have very influential managers or are taken in powerful movers in their target networks.\n“I can be impatient. But I don’t think it’s always a bad habit. Sometimes a little impatience can be a good thing. It keeps you motivated.” – Brant Daugherty\nFollow @FashionPulis on Twitter and @fashionpulis on Instagram. Please continue to send your comments and juicy stories tomichaelsylim@gmail.com.
