(Photo: Stock Xchange) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Next month feline enthusiasts and coffee lovers can kill two birds with one stone at Ferndale’s first cat cafe.\nThe Ferndale Cat Shelter’s Catfé Lounge, at 821 Livernois, plans to open next month as a place to relax or work, sip coffee and pet some kitties who are available for adoption.\nIt’s a good way to get to know a potential pet in a more natural setting. A local cat cafe also may be beneficial to people who like the company of cats but can’t have one in their home.\n“The idea is a cage-free space where people and cats can relax and get to know each other,” says Deanne Iovan, director of the Ferndale Cat Shelter.\n“We will be asking visitors for a suggested donation of $10 per hour for the privilege of spending time with our adorable, adoptable cats and helping themselves to as many hot beverages as they can handle. Wi-fi will be available for our guests as well, so bring your laptop.”\nBecause of health codes, the coffee will be self-serve at first. The donations collected will benefit the Ferndale Cat Shelter and also go toward building out the space to create a separate café where coffee, sandwiches and baked goods will be sold. Customers could then take their purchase next door to hang with the felines.\nLook for the Catfé Lounge to open in early November. Similar concepts have been popular in Japan and Russia. The Cat’s Meow cat cafe is set to open in Ann Arbor next year.\nmbaetens@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/melodybaetens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:01:30.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
