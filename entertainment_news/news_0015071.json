But it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world.” \nHe even jokingly referred to the aftermath of the crash. \n\"People were wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100-percent mental capacity?'\" he said. \"But the truth is -- I never did. I might actually be a few points higher now.\" \nDuring his opening monologue, Morgan reunited with former cast members from the NBC sitcom 30 Rock , including Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer. \nMorgan, 46, participated in several sketches, including one about Family Feud and another about action star Jackie Chan's current whereabouts. He also reprised his SNL roles as nature host Brian Fellow and Astronaut Jones. \nThe comedian was injured in a crash involving a Walmart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike that killed James McNair, a comedian who was riding in a limo bus with Morgan. Earlier this year, Walmart settled a civil lawsuit with Morgan and a wrongful death claim with the family of McNair. \nSince recovering from his injuries, Morgan performed stand-up at the Comedy Cellar in New York City earlier this month. Before that, he made an appearance at the 2015 Emmy Awards and thanked his doctors and family. \n\"It's been a long road back,” he said at the time. “I suffered a traumatic brain injury that put me in a coma for eight days...[when I woke up] I was just ecstatic to learn I wasn't the one who messed up.\" \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
