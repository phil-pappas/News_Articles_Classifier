Writer Dan Jewell's collection of poems, A Nashville Woman and Other Sorrows , received the highest award given in the love/romance poetry category of the international 2015 Readers Favorite competition. This year's contest was the largest ever with thousands of entries ranging from indie authors to NYT bestsellers and authors.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273427\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273428\nJewell's poems tell the story of a Nashville songwriter whose life spirals downward after he loses the woman he loves. The collection also includes poems and songs about rejection, writer's block, pickup trucks, Taylor Swift , cowboys, and the struggles of the dreamers who come to Nashville seeking fame and fortune. Readers Favorite Reviewer Lorelai Rivers gives the book a five star rating and says, \"These poems ring true, as though author Dan Jewell has first-hand experience of the hope and heartbreak of being a working or non-working, musician/songwriter.\"\nJewell says that some of the poems and songs were written over thirty-five years ago. \"I was born in Nashville , so songwriting was in the very air I breathed every day. It was only natural that I would try my hand at it. My wife and I cut a demo of some of my songs once in the old Woodland Studio.\"\nLike most of the other dreamers who come to Nashville , Jewell says his songs went nowhere. \"And this collection of poems is about those dreamers as much as anything, the ones who come here and struggle but keep at it, and the others who don't make it in music but end up making a life for themselves instead. We know more than we want to know about all the ones who make it big. It's the others I write for.\"\nCountry music fans, aspiring songwriters and performers, and anyone whose dreams didn't quite materialize will enjoy this provocative book. More information about the book and the author can be found on the website http://www.musiccitypoetry.com/ . A Nashville Woman & Other Sorrows is available as an eBook on Kindle and Nook, and in paperback on amazon.com.\nAbout Dan Jewell\nAward winning author Dan Jewell and his wife Joyce live on five wooded acres near Nashville.
