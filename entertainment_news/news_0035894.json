'Adam Newman' ( Justin Hartley ) was convicted and then sentenced to 10 years in prison for actions that appeared connected to the death of 'Delia Abbott' (Sophie Pollono) on ' The Young and the Restless '. Then, after he left the courthouse and was walking in the street toward the police van, 'Adam' was hit by a car.\nPhoto by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images View all 5 photos A form of Divine Providence, karma or kismet? Genoa City residents can label it as they like. But, the sight of ' Adam ' lying on the macadam created a form of fictional justice in the minds of vengeful viewers who have been waiting for 'Fake Gabriel' to get his due. Add this to the accident scene as well: The driver's face wasn't seen.\nConsidering 'Billy Abbott's' ( Burgess Jenkins ) unexpected public statement of forgiveness and ' Victor's ' ( Eric Braeden ) words on his son's behalf, it seemed like 'Adam' had gained some peace of mind and a bit of compassion from the 'Mustache', at long last. The judge listened to impact statements and offered a fair sentence. He opted against the maximum penalty and instead, assigned 'Adam' to ten years in the state penitentiary.\nNaturally, devotees are wondering if 'Chloe' ( Elizabeth Hendrickson ) mowed 'Adam' down in retribution? 'Kevin' (Greg Rikaart) certainly descended to a chipmonk-like state after the sentence was announced. He could have aimed a vehicle at 'Victor, Junior' as well. Possibly, 'Delia's' real killer (if one believes 'Adam' didn't create this infamous accident) was behind the wheel of the Karma Car? But, this type of speculation merely represents one angle to be measured.\n'Adam's' condition will be updated next week. YR will reveal if the police have any leads on this new mystery man, or woman, who attempted to commit homicide. And maybe, just maybe, as this two-year-plus odyssey extends even further, the 'Delia Dies' mystery will finally be resolved.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/", "https://twitter.com/Hartleyjustin", "http://www.ericbraeden.com/"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:42:14.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
