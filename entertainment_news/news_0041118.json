Journalist Christer Holmgren believes that he has found a suspect who can not only be linked directly to one of the murders, but also whose daily routine could be consistent with all the other deaths. Having studied the case for more than three decades, his focus eventually fell on a witness called Charles Cross, whose real name turned out to be Charles Allen Lechmere, which led him to a mass of incriminating evidence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:42:31.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
