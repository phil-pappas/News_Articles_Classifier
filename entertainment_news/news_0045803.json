Guys?).\nThere's nothing a fandom likes more than for one of their theories to be approved by the big honchos, and so it's good news all round now that directors John Musker and Ron Clements have given this particular one a thumbs up.\n Said fan theory involves the peddler at the beginning of the film holding the lamp, as many fans theorise that that is actually the Genie in disguise - namely because he was also voiced by the late Robin Williams, but also because he has just four fingers like the wish granter.\nSpeaking to E! news about the particular theory, Clements said:\n\"I saw something that speculates that the peddler at the beginning of ​Aladdin ​is the Genie. That's true! So, that's an urban legend that actually is true.\"\nMore From Cosmopolitan AMAZING.\n​The peddler was apparently meant to be revealed as the Genie at the end of the film, but it never happened due to plot changes and final edits. ​\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail Related Article Step Inside the Truly Epic \"Empire\" Mansion Related Article The Perfect Nail Art For People Who Think They Can't Do Their Own Nail Art From: Cosmo UK", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x279/placeholder_1445287464-syn-cos-1445270340-200.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/14/640x320/landscape-1428073001-072.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/placeholder_1445287464-syn-cos-1445270340-200.gif", "http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/entertainment/news/a39179/aladdin-fan-theory/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/14/480x240/landscape-1428073001-072.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/16/640x320/landscape-1429207990-landscape-1428950985-empire-lead-image-1-de.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445287464-syn-cos-1445270340-200.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x279/1445287464-syn-cos-1445270340-200.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/16/480x240/landscape-1429207990-landscape-1428950985-empire-lead-image-1-de.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:19:12.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
