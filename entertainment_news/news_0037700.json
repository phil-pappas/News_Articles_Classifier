The dossier was presented by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is on a two day visit to meet US President Barack Obama. \nAccording to a report, US Secretary of State John Kerry denied that his aides acknowledged the charges presented under the three dossiers by Pakistan’s leader. Pakistan officials and its intelligence agencies has repeatedly accused India of supporting Baloch rebels. Baloch rebels have clashed with the government and Pakistan security forces for almost a decade.

It is said that Kerry was briefed about the alleged destabilising role of Indian agencies in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Balochistan and Karachi. However, State Department spokesperson, John Kirby told reporters that he was “not aware that we have” received any documents relating to India from Pakistan. \nDeclining to “get into the specifics of the discussion” between Kerry and Sharif, he said, “We continue to believe that India and Pakistan stand to benefit from practical cooperation, and we encourage both India and Pakistan to engage in direct dialogue aimed at reducing tensions. The normalisation of relations between Pakistan and India is vital to both countries and to the region, and steps that initiate closer regional trade and energy ties we believe will create jobs, lower inflation, and increase energy supply.” \nSharif, according to AP, also reiterated his commitment to seek normalisation with India. United State officials asked Pakistan to put in “additional efforts to end terrorim in their country”. Nawaz Sharif is scheduled to meet United States President Obama at the White House on Thursday.

These include “economic growth, trade and investment, clean energy, global health, climate change, nuclear security, counterterrorism, and regional stability.” \nModified Date: October 22, 2015 7:26 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:37:27.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
