I'm going to be alone with three children a lot, but we're just going to figure it out.\" \nHowever, the former 'The Hills' star believes her three-year-old son Camden - her oldest child - will help her out a lot. \nShe added: \"He's really sweet, so I'm just hoping that he'll be my little helper and help me out as much as possible.\" \nAnd Kristin - who also has 17-month-old Jaxon with Jay - is looking forward to adding a little girl to her brood next month and has already kitted out her nursery with \"everything pink.\" \nShe explained: \"Everyone's really excited. I'm already getting the nursery ready! I didn't think I would be a big 'pink' girl but everything is pink. There's a chandelier. I'm getting all the pink and purple clothes. \n\"I'm just excited to have a little mini me and now I have someone that I can give all of my stuff to, which is great.\" \nMeanwhile, Kristin previously revealed Chicago Bears quarterback Jay is unlikely to be there when she gives birth because he is scheduled to have an away game. \nShe said: \"My mom will be there. Hopefully it will be easy [and] I'll be in and out. If he's not there it will be unfortunate, but I don't think I can say, 'Babe, you can't go to Green Bay or wherever you're going to be, I need you home with me.'\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:19:25.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
