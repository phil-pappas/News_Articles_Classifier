This was not the end of his exploits, however, and by war’s end, he was so respected that Ulysses S. Grant chose Chamberlain to accept the South’s surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia. \nThe novel traces his evolution from an arrogant, overbearing professor to unwitting and unlikely hero and leader of men. Interwoven are subplots including the coming of age of his young orphaned aide; a complicated marriage; and, of course, lots of rousing battle scenes. \nCost’s discussion will include the differences he has discovered between writing history and writing historical fiction. After earning a BA in History from Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., Cost wrote a yet unpublished historical novel about the Cuban Revolution. He has since published two mystery novels, “Mainely Power” and “Mainely Fear.” In 2007, after taking a class on teaching biography in the classroom, Cost returned to historical fiction, choosing Joshua Chamberlain and the Civil War as his topic. The novel was published in April and has been getting good reviews from national publications such as Kirkus Review and the Civil War News. \nThis program is free and open to the public.
