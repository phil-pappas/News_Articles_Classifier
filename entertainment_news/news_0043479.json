Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Indirectly admitting that it is for selfish reasons, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said that he is glad that Vice-President Joe Biden is not running for President because \"frankly, I really want to run against Hillary.\" Trump likened a run against Hillary Clinton to an athletic event and going against the team one wants to oppose because of that team's record. Trump predicted that if he goes against Clinton, that he is going to win, and \"win big,\" according to ABC News on Wednesday.\nBiden, who with his family has been mourning this year's tragic loss of his son Beau, has been anguishing over the decision whether or not to run for several weeks. Throughout the decision-making process, Biden clearly stated that there were many factors involved and that he truly had not yet made up his mind. Despite this, many media pundits and \"talking heads\" either stated or very strongly implied that an announcement of candidacy by Biden was imminent.\nTrump weighed in on Biden's announcement of his decision not to run. Trump stated that it probably was a good thing because Biden most likely would not have been able to get the nomination. Trump made that statement to voters in southeastern Iowa; however, he did not give a reason for his assertions about Biden's political prospects.\nThis weekend Trump will be campaigning for the first time in Florida. He also will be returning to Iowa, one day prior to the third GOP debate which is being held at the University of Colorado in Boulder on October 28, 2015. Trump's biggest GOP adversary, Ben Carson , trails him by seven points currently. The rest of the GOP candidates, including Jeb Bush, are way behind in the polls. It remains to be seen if the next GOP debate rearranges any of the chairs on the deck of the Titanic.", "external_links": ["http://www.hillaryclinton.com/signup/om-hvf-join/?utm_medium=om2016&utm_source=yb&utm_campaign=lb-branded&utm_content=9319355610&utm_term=c", "http://www.donaldjtrump.com/", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-biden-smart-thing-running-president/story?id=34638353"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:39:48.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
