The news comes as the Eye delays the premiere of freshman series \" Angel from Hell \" and moves it to next year. \"2 Broke Girls\", which was supposed to be a midseason filler, will now premiere on Thursday, November 12 at 9.30 P.M. ET/PT. The slot was previously occupied by \"Angel from Hell\" which now has a February 2016 premiere. The new spot actually provides time for CBS to promote the newbie during the network's airing of the Super Bowl on February 7. CBS' comedy block is moving to Thursday nights after the network's Thursday NFL package ends. \" The Big Bang Theory \" and \" Life in Pieces \" move in on November 5, followed by \" Mom \" and \" Elementary \" premieres. \"2 Broke Girls\" skips the night's airing and \"Big Bang Theory\" repeats will fill in. \"Angel from Hell\" actually has been heavily promoted by CBS in the past few months but delaying it means CBS won't have to cramp up new shows after the football. Starring Jane Lynch and Maggie Lawson , the comedy follows a woman who claims to be the guardian angel for a young doctor.
