(Photo: COURTESY PHOTO) Thursday, Oct. 29 at 7 p.m. MSU-Northern Student Union Ballroom, Havre $5 for adults, $3 for students, MSU-N students and employees are free   \nThe Associated Students of MSU-Northern are proud to present Nelly’s Echo to the campus of MSU-Northern on Thursday, Oct. 29 at 7 p.m. in the Student Union Ballroom. \nNelson “Nelly” Emokpae, an accomplished singer-songwriter and guitarist, originally hails from Nigeria, Africa. He draws on his multicultural background and experiences to tell his story in music and lyrics and has appeared on the third season of NBC's The Voice. \nThe name “Nelly’s Echo” originates from the premise that music is a two way street. “Nelly” refers to the musician and music, while “Echo” refers to the audience’s appreciation of the music. \nBlending soul, reggae and blues, Nelly’s Echo transports the listener into his musical story. Emokpae has been compared to the likes of Seal and Sting, with a little John Mayer thrown in as he mixes a little calypso, a little Afro-beat and a lot of soul into a winning and charming style that is always a crowd pleaser. \nOn his website, Emokpae calls himself and “introvert rockstar,” acknowledging the inherent contradiction in that title. \nFurther highlighting his eclectic personality, he shares, “One of my favorite things to do is roll my car window down, stick my head out, and have a perfectly normal conversation with a stranger’s dog. The dogs never seem to mind, but the strangers act all weird.” \n“Nelly’s Echo” is free to MSU-Northern students, faculty and staff. Otherwise, tickets are $5 for adults and $3 for students.
