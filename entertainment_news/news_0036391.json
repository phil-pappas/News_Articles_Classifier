Channel Local Real Estate Subscribe Now \nTHERE has come a point in Australian television where The Bachelorette has hit the number one spot in the rating's charts week after week, and last night's finale is no exception. \nWith an estimated 1.5 million viewers across the country last night, I think we can all thank the Twitterverse for this shift in our choice of TV viewing. \nOnce upon a time we watched reality shows such as The Bachelorette and took the heavily produced scenes as nothing but absolute hogwash - most of you probably still hold those sentiments. \nBut what Twitter has done is add an extra element to the entertainment. \nGiven that there are only 140 characters to use in one tweet -minus 20 odd characters for the hashtag- the live feed of comments during the show are always quick witted, one-liners that are often more entertaining than the program itself. \nWhat Twitter has also done is introduce us to some pretty brilliant writers, such as Rosie Waterland. \nThe Rosie Recaps that publish the moment the episode of The Bachelorette ends are an institution of their own. \nThe traffic the recaps get on the Mamamia website is astounding. It's recorded to be over 2 million hits on a single recap alone. \nFor those who haven't read Rosie's witting and often crude recaps, they recount the highlights of the episode in the most hilarious way. \nWhat's even more interesting is Channel Ten's response to these recaps. Instead of shying away from her blatant outing about the production and editing of the episodes, they have worked with Rosie and send her the advance screening of the episodes. \nThe network obviously understands the benefit of endorsing someone like Rosie Waterland, and her huge audience. \nThe cult-like following that comes with each episode is what's made this series such a success. It's become bigger than just watching an episode of The Bachelor or The Bachelorette. \nPeople host 'Bachie' parties, where there are drinking games associated with certain phrases such as 'chemistry' or 'connection', that prompt one to drink. I've also seen a 'Bachie Bingo' on Twitter, where people mark of different scene's or common catch phrases used throughout the episode to win prizes with their friends. \nWhat Twitter and the recaps have done is make fun at the reality of reality TV, and I don't think Channel Ten could have predicted the popularity of the show. \nI'm not ashamed to admit how much I enjoy watching each season, and happily join in on the twitter feed each week. If you don't take the show too literally and appreciate the 'story telling' of this so-called reality TV, you can actually find it pretty entertaining. bachelorette", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:07:57.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
