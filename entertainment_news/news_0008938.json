After studying psychology at university in Leicester, she moved to London. \nSarah said: \"I was working in the City as a client relationship manager, dealing with banks. It was high-powered and very stressful. \n\"I realised after five years that working in that environment was not for me, and decided to find a way to work for myself.\" \nIt was at that point that fate took a hand. She said: \"I had developed skin sensitivity and lots of allergies. Someone had bought me a book on soap-making, and I decided to give it a go. \n\"I really enjoyed it, and after a while I decided to quit my job and make soap for a living.\" \nShe re-trained as a massage therapist to keep some money coming in, and with husband Casie took on a variety of jobs including dog-walking and pet-sitting while honing her soap-making techniques. \nWorking from her kitchen table, Sarah started selling her soaps at craft fairs before eventually winning orders from a couple of London stockists. One of the shops then opened a craft studio, where Sarah was invited to teach sewing, candle-making and soap-making. \nShe said: \"That's when we hatched a plot to leave London and go into business somewhere else. It was a toss-up between Devon and Scotland, where we had holidayed, but in the end Devon won – it was nearer and I still had family there.\" \nIn 2011, she moved to the Clovelly estate, where the family moved into a former grain store which had been converted into a living and working space, with a purpose-built studio for classes and rooms for soap making. \nThe estate also gave the business its new name, and with a rebrand and new website The Clovelly Soap Company was born. \nSarah uses her studio to teach the secrets of soap-making. She said: \"Soap-making is probably the most popular of the courses we run. People come from all over the country to learn. \n\"Some want to do it for a hobby, some for a one-off experience, while others want to learn what they need to do to create their own business. \n\"Part of the attraction is that we only use natural products. \n\"People are becoming more aware of the chemicals in modern products – they want to know what they are putting on their skin and to make soap for themselves and for Christmas presents.\" \nFinding the magic ingredients \nAccording to Sarah, the principles of soap-making have not change for hundreds of years. \nThe base is a blend of oils, such as olive or coconut oil, which are then blended with a catalyst, sodium hydroxide. \nThis is then mixed with other natural 'ingredients' such as herbs, plants, oils and clays and left to 'cook' overnight to form the familiar block of soap. \nSarah, the mother of two daughters aged seven and one, said: \"On our courses we spend the morning talking about the background of soap-making, what it used to be used for and how it has now been replaced by detergents. \n\"Then we talk about equipment, methods and trouble-shooting. People work in pairs, and at the end of they day they take home around 30 bars of soap they have made. \n\"We have 20 soaps in our range, but we have a range of ingredients and people can blend their own creations. \n\"We encourage people to use what they have got. For example some people keep goats, and they can use goat's milk in their soap. Bee-keepers can use honey and beeswax.\" \nThe courses also cover candle making and other natural products including creams, body butters and bath bombs. \nSarah has written The Natural & Handmade Soap Book, containing 20 recipes for bath soaps, shampoo bars, homemade washing powder and dishwasher soap bombs. \nFor more information about this, and the range of courses she runs, see www.rowantreestudio.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:26:03.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
