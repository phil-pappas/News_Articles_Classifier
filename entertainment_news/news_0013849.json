State health officials investigated the first incident, which occurred in June, but did not find the hospital at fault. , PATRICK O'NEILL, FILE PHOTO Related article » State health officials did not find Riverside’s Parkview Community Hospital at fault for an incident in which maggots were found on a patient in February.\nBut an investigation found two other problems for the hospital to correct.\nThe state Department of Public Health’s probe was triggered by a June complaint from the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. The union is involved in a labor dispute with the hospital over its representation of about 500 employees.\nHospital CEO Steve Popkin and spokesman David Silver could not be reached for comment Thursday, Oct. 15. Parkview officials have denied the allegations in the union’s complaint. The state this week provided a copy of the hospital’s plan to correct the issues the state found.\nUnion spokesman Sean Wherley said the state investigation determined the problems the union raised existed, and “despite what the hospital has alleged these were real problems and now they’re going to be forced to address them.”\nAccording to a state report, investigators concluded that the hospital failed to report a power outage that affected the care of several patients on ventilators. Hospitals are legally required to notify the state of any incident that may threaten the safety of patients, staff or visitors.\nState officials also found a set of fire doors that didn’t completely close, which could be a safety issue if a fire broke out.\nThe union’s complaint said a hospital worker found maggots in a patient’s mouth in February, but the report didn’t mention the incident because it only discusses issues the hospital is required to fix. A state public health spokesman wrote in an email that the hospital was not found in violation regarding the maggots.\n“Although our investigation determined that maggots were observed on the patient, there was no evidence that exposure to insects occurred at the facility,” spokesman Corey Egel wrote.\nThe union filed a separate complaint Oct. 5 that alleged that maggots were found on a patient in August. The state is still investigating that complaint.\nRegarding the problems cited by investigators, the hospital told the state it fixed the fire doors and will inspect them regularly, and that it has updated its policy to ensure incidents such as the power outage are reported when required, according to the state report.\nThe union and hospital management have been entangled in an increasingly public battle for months stemming from hospital employees’ March 2014 vote to join the union.\nHospital officials questioned the validity of the election and are challenging the union’s representation in court, after the National Labor Relations Board reviewed their objections and upheld the vote result.\nMeanwhile, union officials have filed complaints against the hospital with the state health department and placed newspaper advertisements critical of Parkview management.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9461 or arobinson@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwabvp-b88541335z.120151015162655000g3kcjmv9.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwabvp-b88541335z.120151015162655000g3kcjmv9.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:14:03.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
