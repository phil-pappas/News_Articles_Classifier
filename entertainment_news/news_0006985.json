I was shocked by some of the outfits the performers wore, but my daughter didn't seemed fazed at all. She looks up to these stars, but I think they are sending the wrong message. How should I approach this with her?\nA: Unfortunately the media we consume is filled with images of women who are dressed in a provocative way and there is no way to shield young girls from seeing them, the Help for Families says.\nIt even starts with superheroes when all the female heroes are dressed in form-fitting outfits says panelist Pam Wallace.\n\"Kids are desensitized to it by this age,\" agrees panelist Jessica Katzbeck.\nYou can censor things anymore adds panelist Chad Stefanyak\nPoint out that these are performers on TV and they are wearing costumes, Wallace says. They don't wear those outfits on the street.\n\"The important word here is 'costumes,'\" Katzbeck says.\nBy the age of 12, girls should have a healthy serf image and understand what it means to be beautiful, says panelist Denise Continenza.\n\"This is an opportunity to talk about family values,\" she says. \"Ask her what she thinks of the outfits.\"\nDiscuss it with her says panelist Michael Daniels.\n\"Say 'I was really shocked but you don't seem fazed,'\" Stefanyak says. \"Maybe she'll say I'll never dress like that. Just because she sees it on TV, doesn't mean she's going to do it.\"\nTalk about how the women on TV dress like that to get attention, Wallace says.\nAsk her if that is the kind of attention she wants.\n\"Explain for every positive there's a negative right behind it,\" says Katzbeck. \"Google the star and look at the comments that are both positive and negative. It will make her realize you never know which way it's going to go.\"\nThings are different today in these girls' world, she says.\n\"Because of the availability of what's out there, they are learning quicker and becoming immune to it at a much younger age,\" Katzbeck says.\nThis why you need to start having those conversations with your children at an earlier age, Continenza says.\nYou need to have taught your Daughter to make the right choices by this age, Katzbeck says.\n\"If she doesn't seem fazed, you probably did a good job,\" she says. \"She may get it already and the less deal you make out of it, the better.\"\nShe may be very aware that those outfits are not something she could wear to school but still wants to watch to see what the stars are wearing, the panel says.\nAlso have a discussion about more effective ways to get attention, Stefanyak says.\nThe bottom line is you are still the parent. If she wants to wear those types of fashions, don't buy her the clothes.\nKathy.lauer@mcall.com\n610-778-2235\nTOPIC TEAM\nParenting experts and guest panelists who helped this week:\nPam Wallace , program coordinator for Project Child, a program of Valley Youth House.\nChad Stefanyak , school psychologist, Lehigh County.\nDenise Continenza , family living specialist for Penn State's Lehigh County Cooperative Extension, South Whitehall Township.\nMichael Daniels , adolescent and attachment therapist, Bethlehem.\nJessica Katzbeck , director community programs, Pinebrook Family Answers, Allentown.\nHelp for Families is a collaboration between The Morning Call and parenting professionals brought together by Valley Youth House's Project Child", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:57:24.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
