Muller has committed the sale of each album to charity: water , an organization that brings clean and safe drinking water to developing nations. Click here to pre-order Two Truths and a Li e on iTunes.\nMuller will kick off his Two Truths and A Lie tour on October 22 , partnering with a different philanthropic organization in each city. Charities include The Robin Hood Foundation in New York City , A Leg To Stand On in Chicago , Berklee College of Music's City Music & AMP UP programs in Boston , Room to Read in Oakland, California , and MOXI , the new Museum of Exploration and Innovation in Santa Barbara . The shows are quickly selling out; for a full list of dates and tickets, see below.\nIn addition, Muller is leading an innovative Facebook campaign challenging friends with a goal to raise up to $50,000 with 5,000 Facebook shares. #2TruthsAndALie is a social media game designed for friends to challenge their knowledge of one another while raising money for charity: water. For every person who shares Muller's original post and challenges at least one other friend to guess a lie out of #2TruthsAndALie, Pete Muller will donate $10 to the organization. Muller notes, \"It's unfathomable for most of us to live without clean water, but that is a reality for many across the globe. Diseases from unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war. If I can bring more awareness to this cause with my music, it's a win all around.\"\nProduced by Rick DePofi (whose credits include Rosanne Cash's Grammy-winning The River & The Thread), Two Truths and a Lie is filled with intimate songs that capture audiences on first listen. Muller is joined on the recording by his long-standing trio members Skip Ward on bass and Kyle Rowland on drums. A number of other well-known players, including trombonist Walter Hawkes , make cameo appearances. Forbes.com recently premiered the video for \"The Muse,\" a swinging jazz waltz that reflects upon the ever-elusive artistic presence. Watch the clip here. Muller previously released the video for \"Kindred Soul,\" which has already been viewed more than 25,000 times.\nWhile he was achieving the highest level of Wall Street success as a pioneer in \"quant\" investing, Muller was also singing his songs to tough-hearted New York City subway audiences. Muller says , \"The best thing about working on Wall Street was that it challenged me to be the best I could be. When I perform I am looking for a similar challenge.\" That philosophy translates to the album and benefit tour. Muller notes, \"I love the passion and joy I feel when I am playing and I want to touch as many people with that joy as I can. If I can also help promote and raise money for these fantastic organizations, that makes it even better.\"\nFor more information visit: http://petemuller.com\nhttp://facebook.com/petemullermusic\nPhoto of Pete Muller here .\nBenefit Show Dates:\nOct 22 - Chicago, IL at City Winery\nBenefit for A Leg To Stand On // Tickets\nOct 23 - Boston, MA at David Friend Recital Hall ( Berklee College of Music )\nBenefit for Berklee College of Music's City Music & AMP UP Programs // Tickets\nOct 28 - New York, NY at City Winery\nBenefit for the Robin Hood Foundation // Tickets\nNov 2 - Oakland, CA at Duende\nBenefit for Room to Read // Tickets\nNov 4 - Santa Barbara, CA at Soho Restaurant & Music Club\nBenefit for MOXI, the new Museum of Exploration and Innovation // Tickets\nPress Contact\nKaren Wiessen\nAutonomic Media\nKaren@autonomicmedia.com\n917-627-9363\n releases/singersongwriterpianistphilanthropist-pete-muller-two-truths-and-a-lie-album-out-october-23-two-truths-and-a-lie-facebook-challenge-targets-50000-raise-all-proceeds-to-charity-water-300154270.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.moxi.org/", "http://petemuller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/065.jpg", "http://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-special-benefit-performance-by-pete-muller-tickets-18205217295", "http://petemuller.com/ttaal/", "https://www.berklee.edu/city-music-network", "http://www.charitywater.org/", "http://petemuller.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/two-truths-and-a-lie/id1045831940", "https://www.facebook.com/petemullermusic/videos/vb.212886965482662/740362769401743/?type=2&theater", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY19728&Transmission_Id=201510051454PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY19728&DateId=20151005", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2015/10/05/quant-hedge-fund-manager-peter-mullers-new-music-video-and-album/", "https://www.roomtoread.org/petemuller", "http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1396690", "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pete-muller-benefit-concert-tickets-18701546830", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/singersongwriterpianistphilanthropist-pete-muller-two-truths-and-a-lie-album-out-october-23-two-truths-and-a-lie-facebook-challenge-targets-50000-raise-all-proceeds-to-charity-water-300154270.html", "http://petemuller.com/event/berklee-college-of-music-boston-cd-release-party/", "http://www.roomtoread.org/", "http://www.axs.com/pete-muller-to-release-new-album-on-oct-23-65607", "http://facebook.com/petemullermusic", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.robinhood.org/", "http://www.altso.org/", "https://youtu.be/dX9XNdULyi4", "http://www.ampupnyc.org/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:09:10.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
