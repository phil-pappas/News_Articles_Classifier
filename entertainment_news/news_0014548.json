Written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, “Snowden” stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the title role. Other cast members include Shailene Woodley, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, Rhys Ifans, Nicolas Cage, Scott Eastwood, Joely Richardson and Timothy Olyphant. \nThe script is based on the books, “The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World’s Most Wanted Man” by Luke Harding; and “Time of the Octopus” by Anatoly Kucherena. \n†Meanwhile, “Miles Ahead,” starring Don Cheadle (who also co-wrote the film, directed it and plays the title role as Miles Davis) will now also not open until some time next year. Roger Friedman’s Showbiz411 website reports the movie, which recently closed the New York Film Festival, won’t even have a one-week, New York-Los Angeles release to qualify for this year’s Oscar consideration. \nThe film is said to be a non-linear portrait of the music great. It is set during a two-day period in the 1980s, when Davis took a break and spent the time in a drug and liquor-induced stupor. The film also stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an unethical record producer and Ewan McGregor as a Rolling Stone reporter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:09:40.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
