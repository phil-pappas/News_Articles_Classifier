Rihanna won best female performer while Nicki Minaj took best hip hop. One Direction won for best pop group, preventing Bieber from sweeping all the awards for which he was nominated. None of those acts were on hand to accept, and only Minaj sent along a video \"thank you.\" \nBest video went to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, who opened the show with their award-winning song \"Downtown,\" with Eric Nally flying against a full moon backdrop. They thanked fans for supporting their music without the backing of a big label. \nPharrell Williams closed out the ceremony, singing a rousing rendition of his anthem \"Freedom\" with dancers in brightly colored swing skirts. As the broadcast wrapped up, cameras cut to the Piazza Duomo in Milan's center, where fans unfurled a huge \"Freedom\" banner to raise awareness about Europe's refugee crisis. \nNew Wave rockers Duran Duran were honored with the first-ever MTV video visionary award honoring music video pioneers. \n\"Their distinctive style has had an undeniable impact on music history,\" MTV said. \nThe awards ceremony travels to a different European city each year and winners are selected by fans across the continent. \n___ \nThis story corrects the name of the ceremony to the MTV EMAs. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
