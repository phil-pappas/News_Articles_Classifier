Later, in a shocking twist, Monica Padilla was blindsided by her fellow Bayon tribe members. \nThe castaways started off with a reward challenge. Three members of each tribe were tied together, while a fourth was inside a barrel. They rolled the barrel to a series of flagpoles, where the person in the barrel collected a bag of balls and got back in. Once all three bags of balls were collected, they raced to roll the balls into a series of targets. The first tribe to finish won chairs, pillows, hammocks, blankets, candles and tarps. Additionally, refreshments were waiting for them back at camp. The second-place team got a tarp and rope. Ta Keo and Ankgor came in first and second, respectively. \nFor the immunity challenge, the contestants raced up a tower, through a series of obstacles, to get to the top. Once there, they launched sandbags, attempting to hit a series of targets. The first two tribes to hit all their targets won immunity. Angkor finished first, followed by Ta Keo. \nBack at camp, Kelly Wigglesworth and Spencer Bledsoe, former Takeo members who joined the Bayon tribe after the week-3 switch-up, felt certain one of them would be going home. However, Monica’s attempt to convince Kimmi Kappenberg to form an all-girl alliance backfired. Kimmi, noting Padilla’s a “snake in the grass,” convinced Stephen Fishbach and Jeremy Collins to “blindside” Monica by casting their votes for her. They agreed, and a shocked Monica was voted off the island. \nSurvivor Cambodia: Second Chance returns Wednesday at 8 p.m. Eastern time on CBS. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:45:10.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
