Here are his First Impressions of Buffalo's 24-10 loss to the New York Giants at Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday: THE FIRST WORD : Watching the lifeless, mistake-prone Bills lose to a very well-prepared, Tom Coughlin coached Giants team reminds me of the danger of overreacting to impressive victories, such as Buffalo's 41-14 thrashing of the Miami Dolphins.\nWe now know that a lot of teams are going to beat hapless Miami this season, such as the New York Jets, who defeated the Dolphins 27-14 on Sunday. That pretty much takes the luster off of Buffalo's dominating performance, especially after the way they played against the Giants.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRyan says Bills had fight but what good did it do?\nWhen it comes to running the ball, stopping the run and playing disciplined football, coach Rex Ryan sure talks a good game. But his team, already the third most penalized in the NFL, rolled up 17 penalties for 135 yards against the Giants, shades of the loss to New England when Buffalo also dug itself a hole it also couldn't crawl all the way out of because of self-inflicted mistakes.\nTwo touchdowns were negated by offensive penalties against the Giants and defensive and special teams errors led to a Giants score.\n\"We didn't lose because two touchdowns were called back, but it took the wind out of our sails,'' Ryan said.\nJust as this loss did to Bills fans.\nPLAYER OF THE GAME : Giants punter Brad Wing. In close, hard-fought football games, oftentimes the best play is the safest play and that means punt the ball. Wing was superb with eight punts for a 44.4 average, with four dropped inside the Bills' 20-yard line. Buffalo's offense was struggling and it didn't help matters starting drives from the 6-, 7-, 8- and 10-yard lines.\nPLAY OF THE GAME : Eli Manning's 51-yard touchdown pass to running back Rashad Jennings that restored a two-touchdown lead with 9:41 to play. It was actually about a one-yard dump pass and 50-yard run made possible by three missed tackles by Buffalo defenders Nigel Bradham (in the backfield), Preston Brown and Bacarri Rambo further down field and along the sidelines.\nUNSUNG HERO GAME BALL : Cornerback Stephon Gilmore. He had the tough assignment of covering Giants super talented second-year receiver Odell Beckhman, Jr., and held him to five catches (on 12 targeted throws) for 38 yards. Gilmore had two passes defended and an interception.\nKEY STAT : The Bills ran for just 55 yards (2.3 average) on 24 attempts against New York's No. 2-ranked defense against the run. Rookie running back Karlos Williams averaged just 2.2 yards per carry as the Giants had an easy time handling his between-the-tackles skill set. This is where LeSean McCoy's outside speed was really missed.\nSOME OBSERVATIONS\n*Quarterback Tyrod Taylor and tight end Charles Clay are going to make a dynamite pair, but someone tell them what 10 yards looks like. On the Bills first two possessions, pass completions to Clay came up short on third-down plays and set a bad early tone.\n*If the Giants played in the AFC East, Tom Coughlin would no doubt have as many wins as New England's Bill Belichick; Coughlin, the Waterloo native and former RIT coach, is 10-1 all-time against the AFC East as Giants coach, including 3-0 against Buffalo.\n*Bills kicker Dan Carpenter, who has struggled since training camp, badly hooked a 30-yard field goal attempt at a critical juncture of the third quarter. You may soon see him and Dolphins coach Joe Philbin looking for work.\n*After allowing 92 yards rushing, missing an alarming number of tackles and committing boneheaded penalties, we can hold off talk that Buffalo's defense is \"elite.''\n*It's nice to believe the Bills depth is the best it's been in years, but taking Shady McCoy and Sammy Watkins out of the lineup and saying everything's fine is delusional. The bad news for Buffalo is that they may be sidelined with leg injuries a while longer.\nLOOKING AHEAD: The Bills hit the quarter pole of the 16-game NFL season with a 2-2 record but it's not a \"good'' 2-2. Three of their games were at home and losing to the Giants (2-2 and could easily be 4-0) was a missed opportunity to cement themselves as a true playoff contender. The good news is that there is still a lot of season left, starting at Tennessee. The Titans (1-2) are coming off a bye and like the Patriots and Giants will have had more rest and preparation time than Buffalo. Conspiracy theorists talk amongst yourselves.\nLROTH@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce5e20b48beab389875d28f5bbb128e59c422e48/c=679-0-3636-2957/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Rochester/Rochester/635795773185257453-JG-100415-Bills-3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:32:32.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
