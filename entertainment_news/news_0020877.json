Melbourne has helped foster two examples, Filmme Fatales ​ and  Fireflies , visually inventive and distinctly different publications produced by young editors with a strong vision.\nFilmme Fatales was founded in 2013 by Brodie Lancaster, who works for writing studio and publisher The Good Copy, and contributes to, among other things, Rookie , Vulture and Pitchfork.  She started the magazine initially as \"a kind of hobby\", produced outside the demands of a full-time job.\nA call-out for pitches for the next issue closes on October 11. Photo: Justin McManus \nLancaster had plenty of experience online, and thought print would offer a new set of challenges. It also had some specific advantages. Having edited a culture website, she says, \"I knew that if something wasn't written about in time, it was old news\".  Print has more timeless qualities; people are happy to acquire back issues, because they don't feel \"timed out or expired\". Online readers are more likely to respond strongly to individual pieces, to post one particular story to friends, she says but with Filmme Fatales, the response tends to focus on the magazine as a whole.\nAdvertisement The idea for the magazine grew out of a connection she hoped to make between two areas she felt strongly about. \"I'd been reading feminist writing and film theory and criticism, and I wanted to see more crossover. But I wanted to do something that was more to do with people talking about what they enjoyed and why, and what they thought about it.\" There's a sense of playfulness and pleasure in many of Filmme Fatales' pieces, but also a sense of urgency, passion, fierce commitment.\nLancaster sets a theme for each issue. The first was \"the 20-something funk\", the current issue, number 6, is \"one more shot\". She's had a \"working girls edition\" and one on music in the movies. Interpretations of the theme can range widely. Issue 6 includes an essay that asks, of Noah Baumbach's recent feature, \"What if Frances Ha were black?\" a fan letter to director Nicole Holofcener​; an anatomy of heartbreak, a defence of actress Denise Richards; and Courtney Barnett's top four musical moments in film. \nFrom Filmme Fatales issue no. 1 Photo: Supplied \n\"It's a print publication, but it wouldn't exist without the internet,\" Lancaster says. That's how she connected with contributor Gemma Flynn, a Scottish stand-up comedian, who found Filmme Fatales via Tumblr. Flynn pitched her a piece for the first issue – Lancaster has posted the pitch on the website, as a how-to example — and has written for every subsequent issue. \nThere have been male contributors, and female writers writing about male directors, but the magazine is skewed towards women's voices. Along the way, Filmme Fatales has evolved from a zine style to something more elegant with a stronger emphasis on illustration. At first, it was an after-hours project Lancaster also designed herself. Since issue 4, the first in full colour, she's had a designer, and The Good Copy have published the magazine. \nIssue 6 marks a shift in the design, printing and launch of the magazine, she thinks of it as something of a fresh start. She's keen to make events a bigger part of what Filmme Fatales is about, and she's planning a conference early next year. A call-out for pitches for the next issue, with the theme \"Space\", closes on October 11. \nFireflies , a more recent publication focusing on film, has an editorial team of three: Annabel Brady-Brown, Giovanni Marchini Camia and designer James Geoffrey Nunn The first issue was crowd-funded, the second financed through personal savings and income from the first issue, Fireflies takes its name from The Disappearance of the Fireflies , a famous essay by the late director Pier Paolo Pasolini published in 1975. \nFireflies focuses on directors. Each issue is devoted to two filmmakers, and a director interview is at the heart of the project. The first issue was about Pasolini  (with an interview with his actor and muse Ninetto Davoli) and the Thai filmmaker Apitchatpong Weerasethakul, ﻿ the second focused on Hungarian director Bela Tarr and Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami.\n\"The kind of cinema we love and want to talk about comes mainly from auteurist cinema. The journey of discovering a new director and wanting to see everything they have made is exciting for us,\" Brady-Brown says.\nThey also felt the notion of using two directors as a focus \"was a really simple way of inviting people in\". The idea is that the two will be contrasting figures but, in the process of making the magazine, connections can become apparent.\nAlongside the specially conducted interviews, they assemble a range of creative responses, artworks, poems and essays, some commissioned, some from open calls. They don't necessarily seek out writers or artists who already know the filmmakers' work: sometimes the pleasure comes from introducing contributors to a new source of inspiration. \"We want new voices and new narratives for a film, not just repeating the same themes, ideas and interpretations.\" \nBrady-Brown had made zines in the past, and comes from an editing and publishing background, her co-editor is more closely associated with film. They both wanted to make a magazine, she says, \"because we really love the ethos of print. You can pick it up, hold it, return to it\". There's something about its longevity, she says, and the appeal of an aesthetic in which \"everything comes together as a whole\". The magazine is divided into two, and has double covers: the two halves meet in the middle, and it's full of small design elements that she feels would get lost online. \nBrady-Brown, currently living in Berlin but soon to return to Melbourne, has found a European base useful for getting the magazine distributed and printed, as well as publicised. Online networks bring people to the magazine too. And she's also keen to explore ways to complement the magazine through its website — video essays, for example. Screenings and events are already an important part of Fireflies and will be part of its future direction.\nThe next issue is due out in February 2016. Details are still being finalised, so they aren't able to reveal the subjects. All they can say at this stage is that Fireflies issue 3 will focus on \"two very special filmmakers whose work we find emotionally rich, socially-minded and aesthetically daring\". The directors will be announced in November, with an open call for submissions. \nRead more at  filmmefatales.com  and  fireflieszine.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:19:37.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
