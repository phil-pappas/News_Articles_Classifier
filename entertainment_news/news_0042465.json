Contributed Contributed Local Real Estate Subscribe Now \nVIOLINIST Greta Kelly said the group's sound blended influences from the Mediterranean to the Balkans to the Middle East. \n\"Our double bass player is from Bosnia, and our darabuka player has Turkish-Greek heritage, and our accordion player is from Latvia. We've got Paulene who's French and John the guitarist and I, we're from Brisbane,\" she said. \n\"Our mix of influences is what makes us unique.\" \nLead vocalist Pauline Maudy sings most of the songs in French, but some are sung in the traditional language of her Spanish Jewish ancestors. \n\"The Jews who were living in Spain had their own language called Ladino, which is a mixture of Hebrew and Spanish,\" said Greta. \n\"It's a dead language now because the Jews of Spain were forced to leave... they kept their language alive through song.\" \nGreta said for most of the members in the band, including herself, music had been passed down through the generations. \n\"My grandparents were really influential. My grandfather taught me to play violin and his dad taught him to play the violin,\" she said. \n\"My great-grandfather used to play for the silent movies, and my great-grandmother used to play the piano.\" \nGreta said living in Prague and Turkey had \"opened her ears\" to non-Western style music. \n\"I was really interested in improvising in rock bands, and I was always looking for something that sounded unique,\" she said. \n\"I was drawn to Middle Eastern music because of the unusual scales and Balkan music because of the unusual rhythms. \n\"Definitely traveling would have been one of the major influences in the music that I play.\" \nMzaza will travel to Mackay for Global Grooves festival on Saturday. \nThe band will host a workshop at 2.40pm. \nGreta said those who attend the workshop will be invited to join the band on stage for one song during their set at the main stage, which will start at 4.40pm. entertainment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:16:50.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
