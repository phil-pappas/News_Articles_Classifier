His book collects lessons and romantic wisdom based on “ Relationship Realities ” (published by Xlibris), providing readers with ways to strengthen their bonds with their loved ones. “Relationship Realities” is a book consisting of several years of intense relationship research , several years of conversations on the topic, lots of personal thought and experiences, several conferences and workshops, as well as sharing and many hours spent in coaching others with relationship issues . This book grasps a truth of reality of what can happen in relationships.\n“After doing intense work with others as related to their relationships and seeing most of them improve. I realized that a lot of relationships suffered out of not knowing how to improve them. I wanted to do something to start to give others ideas to improve their relationships in hope of seeing an overall less drop in negative relationships,” James says. My book is about some of the Realities that can occur in Relationships if we go into them with little to no expectations. It will help you understand that Relationships have a much better chance at being successful when we don’t carry over negative experiences and baggage from our past ones. Hopefully the book will give you insight on tools needed to ensure a positive and nurturing relationship.”\nWith these lessons gained from “Relationship Realities,” couples can face the uncertain future together, equipped with the advice James has provided them.\n“Relationship Realities”\nBy Darrell James\nHardcover | 6 x 9in | 82 pages | ISBN 9781503599574\nSoftcover | 6 x 9in | 82 pages | ISBN 9781503599581\nE-Book | 82 pages | ISBN 9781503599567\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nDarrell James currently resides in Columbus, although born in Chicago and raised in Ft.
