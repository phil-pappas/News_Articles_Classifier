The World Bank takes all allegations of fraud and corruption very seriously. Although the Hitachi contract was not financed by the World Bank, our Integrity Vice Presidency is assessing the matter to see whether any World Bank funds were put at risk,‚Äù she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:07:31.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
