Tuscaloosa is certainly not immune to that,\" said Greene Beverage craft beer manager Mike McWhirter. \"We are very fortunate to have three very good brewers here in Tuscaloosa. We felt like it was important to showcase those brewers and what they were able to do.\" \nTogether, the breweries will collaborate to create the \"Rising Tide,\" a pale ale with crimson coloring the brewers promise will have a nice aroma and taste that isn't too bitter thanks to some \"super\" hops. \nBlack Warrior co-owner and head brewer Jason Spikes said the beer will have special hops and roasted grain to add the reddish color to play up the Crimson Tide-themed name. Druid City will provide some special San Diego Super Yeast hops, while the recently opened Band of Brothers has helped in developing the recipe and will pitch in for the kegging. They'll start with 10 barrels. \nThe beer itself will be brewed at Black Warrior in downtown Tuscaloosa, given its capacity to brew the largest batch at once. \nThe week will start with a kickoff party at the Avenue Pub downtown the Sunday after the Tennessee football game in Tuscaloosa, where patrons can enjoy one beer from each brewery along with the Rising Tide beer. Throughout the week, nine other bars and restaurants will feature the same beers, and patrons will have a chance to try them all and enter to win special Tuscaloosa Craft Beer Week pint classes and T-shirts. \n\"We're excited about doing this,\" McWhirter said. \"For a town its size, Tuscaloosa has three very well-managed and run brewers in town. We feel like it's going to be a great week for people to get out and try some beers they haven't tried before.\" \n\"They've all gotten together and talked about what beer they'd like to brew. They've worked it out and said let's do this. Everybody wants to tweak it their own way. You're going to see a representation of all three brewers in this beer. I think it's going to be cool.\" \nJeremy Donald, Jeremiah Donald and Quintin Brown own Band of Brothers (1605 23rd Avenue); Joe Fuller , Jason Spikes, Eric Hull, Mike Musgrove and Wayne Yarbrough own Black Warrior Brewing Company (2216 University Boulevard); Bo Hicks and Elliott Roberts own Druid City Brewing Company. \nLearn more about Tuscaloosa Craft Beer Week by visiting the Greene Beverage Twitter and Facebook accounts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:59:31.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
