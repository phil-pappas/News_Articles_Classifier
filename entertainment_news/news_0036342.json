But the overall celebration is meant to highlight the Ames chapter’s work and celebrate the multiple partnerships the organization works with in the community. \nWetzler, who has been involved with the Ames Jaycees since 2010, said some of the largest projects the group has done are the Holiday Food Baskets, which provide meals to low-income families during the holiday season, and the Ames on the Half Shell summer concert series. \nWetzler said the events allow the Jaycees to collaborate with several other local organizations, like Mid-Iowa Community Action (MICA) or with local hotels for one of the group’s newest projects, the New Year’s Eve Bash. \nThe partnerships, along with the positive change she has seen the group create, are some of the reasons Wetzler continues to be a part of the Ames branch. \n“It helped me really feel connected to the community and I know if something happens, should I not stay in Ames and move to another community, the first thing I’ll do is look for a surrounding Jaycee chapter,” she said. “Everyone has their own pet project and one you find that, it’s just the most amazing feeling. The Jaycees can be anything to anybody, it’s whatever you want to put in, and the Jaycees can help you do it.” \n\nWhere: Farwell T.
