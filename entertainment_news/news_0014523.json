Early tracking did not look promising for the Joe Wright-directed film but still predicted that \"Pan\" would open at least in the $20 million range.\nThe PG-rated epic, sold as a Peter Pan origin story and a lavish visual feast, has had a bumpy ride from the beginning, starting when actress Rooney Mara, who is white, was cast as Tiger Lily, who is historically Native American. The film, starring Hugh Jackman and Garrett Hedlund, also had been pushed from July to October. It has not been well-received by critics, either.\nMust-see fall 2015 movies \"Pan\" now ranks among 2015's biggest flops, including \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Tomorrowland.\" International earnings don't look promising either. The film brought in a weak $20.5 million. For comparison, \"The Martian\" earned $58.1 million.\n\"This had a lot going against it,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Rentrak.\nHe also believes competition in the family market from the Halloween-themed animated feature \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" hurt \"Pan.\"\n\"Family films always have an audience, but that audience is extremely fickle and hard to please, just like the kids who go to these movies,\" Dergarabedian said. \"You just never know what's going to resonate.\"\nSony's high-wire spectacle \"The Walk\" also stumbled in its first weekend in wide release, after debuting on IMAX screens last week. The tale of Philippe Petit's tight-rope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center earned $3.7 million this weekend, bringing its total to $6.4 million. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in film directed by Robert Zemeckis.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning How accurate is the science behind \"The Martian\"? In this weekend's box office hit, Matt Damon plays an astronaut stranded on Mars after his crew is hit by a sandstorm. But is the drama realistic...\nNot all was bleak at the box office, though. Ridley Scott's space adventure \"The Martian\" earned a solid $37 million in its second week in theaters, nabbing the top spot once more. Its domestic total now stands at $108.7 million.\nStarring Matt Damon, the film is an on-screen adaption of Andy Weir's 2011 novel science-fiction novel -- of the same name -- about an astronaut.\n\"Hotel Transylvania 2\" took second place in its third weekend with $20.3 million, bumping its total to $116.8 million. \"Pan\" came in at No. 3.\nNancy Meyers' workplace comedy \"The Intern\" earned $8.7 million, and the border thriller \"Sicario\" brought in $7.4 million, rounding out the top five.\nOutside the top 10, \"Steve Jobs,\" the biopic of the late Apple CEO directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, opened in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to a powerful $520,942. Its $130,000 per-theater average ranks as the best of the year and should bode well for the film's expansion across the next two weeks.\n\"This is a movie everyone's talking about, and now they're going to be talking about it even more,\" Dergarabedian said.\n---\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
