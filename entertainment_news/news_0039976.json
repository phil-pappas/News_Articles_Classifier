Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played Theo Huxtable in The Cosby Show, has spoken about sex allegations against Bill Cosby. Picture: AP \nTHE Cosby Show alum Malcolm-Jamal Warner says the series’ legacy is “tarnished” by the sexual assault allegations made against Bill Cosby. \n“My biggest concern is when it comes to images of people of colour on television and film, no matter what … negative stereotypes of people of colour, we’ve always had The Cosby Show to hold up against that. And the fact that we no longer have that, that’s the thing that saddens me the most because in a few generations the Huxtables will have been just a fairy tale,” said Warner, who starred as Cosby’s son, Theo Huxtable, on the long-running sitcom. Close ... Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Bill Cosby have remained friends over the years. Picture: Supplied \nWarner said he has been in touch with Cosby, but he would not comment on their conversations. \n“I think the things that we discussed really have to stay private between us. But it’s just a bad situation all around — for him, for his family, the women, their families, the legacy of the show,” said Warner during an interview on Thursday. Malcolm-Jamal Warner on The Cosby Show \nCosby admitted having extramarital relationships with several women, including some who now accuse him of sexual assault. He has never been charged with a crime. \nWarner, who won his first Grammy earlier this year for his work on Robert Glasper’s Jesus Children , is currently promoting his new album, Selfless , out now.
