However, their revenue range suggests consolidation pressures are growing. \nMore than a decade ago in November 2004 The Lawyer published the Rising 50, a magazine subtitled ‘The Law Firms to Watch”. The idea was to extend the regular coverage in what was then The Lawyer UK 100 to include the next 50 largest firms by revenue, highlighting potential rising stars and future trailblazers. Looking back, several particularly dynamic names leap off the page. Near the top of the list back in 2004 was the £14.8m, 27-partner Gateley Wareing. This year as Gateley it became the UK’s first-ever publicly listed law firm, posting a revenue for 2014/15 of £80m. Either side of legacy Gateley Wareing in the Rising 50 with a turnover of £14.9m was Burness, now Burness Paull , Scotland’s second-largest law firm (behind the £57.9m Brodies ) with a £51.3m 2014/15 turnover; and Forsters , £14m in 2004 but now a £41.4m firm with average profit per equity partner (PEP) of £538,000. There is also the £10.6m south-west firm Foot Anstey Sargent at joint 15th place, now just Foot Anstey , a firm that had a good year in 2014/15 and whose turnover rose 16.3 per cent to £30m. Revenue at Foot Anstey has now doubled since 2006/07. There is East Anglia’s Birketts , in 2004 a £7m firm but now, following a 400 per cent, acquisition-fuelled increase in revenue, one that sits comfortably in 72nd place in this year’s UK 200 with a £35m turnover. Others have made the leap and gone on to bigger and better things. After a sluggish few years London-based Harbottle & Lewis , seventh in the Rising 50 in 2004 with a turnover of £13.2m, is now back in the top 100, having posted a 1.4 per cent increase in turnover in 2014/15 from £21.3m to £21.6m. And indeed each year a number of firms do escape the confines of the second 100. This year Guildford-headquartered Stevens & Bolton , where revenue rose for the sixth consecutive year in 2014/15 and which posted a 13 per cent revenue rise to £22.4m, breaks into the top 100 in 93rd place. Back in 2004, Stevens & Bolton was ranked 12th in the Rising 50 with a revenue of £11.1m. The message is clear. For any firm with a clear growth strategy, decisive leadership and the ability to differentiate itself the UK market for the past 10 years has been a land of opportunity. This year’s focus on the second 100 firms by turnover will show that, for some at least, it still is. Rise of the indies Previous editions of The Lawyer UK 200 have primarily focused on the largest firms in the market. Later this month the UK 200: the Top 100 will do just that. But what of those firms outside the top 100, a group this year we have christened the Independents? Why ‘the Independents?’ The majority of the firms in this new UK 200 ranking differ from many of their larger top 100 cousins in that they are primarily focused on UK domestic matters, are not part of any larger merged entity or Verein, and often operate out of a single site or single area. But while these firms’ scale is different from those in the top 100, many of the management issues smaller firms are familiar. Most are dealing with the more-for-less, client-driven agenda just as their larger cousins are and are therefore looking to make efficiencies where they can. The UK 200: The Independents charts every single one of the 100 firms in the lower half of this year’s top 200, detailing the financial performance of each on a range of key metrics and, where possible, highlighting the strategic moves they are making in an effort to compete in one of the world’s most ferocious markets. It is a group that ranges in turnover from Reading’s Clarkslegal at around £7.5m to Southampton’s Moore Blatch on £20.9m. There is just £81,000 between Moore Blatch at the head of the Independents, the second 100 group of firms in the UK 200 by revenue, and Payne Hicks Beach on £21m, the 100th-placed firm in the top 100. This suggests that the Independents is a crowded place to be. Allow us to provide you with more data – much more data - to underline that point. The 100 firms contained in the lower half of this year’s The Lawyer UK 200 generated a total revenue of £1.308bn in 2014/15. That is effectively the same amount of turnover generated by just one firm in the top 100, Clifford Chance (£1.35bn), and almost £200m less than the global revenue of DLA Piper . This is by no means the only startling comparison. Try this: in the bottom 100, the largest firm (Moore Blatch on £20.9m) is three times bigger than the smallest (Clarks-legal). In the top 100, the largest firm (DLA Piper’s £1.504bn) is 72 times bigger than that of the smallest (Payne Hicks Beach, £21m). Or this: the total revenue of the top 10 firms in the Independents, firms from number 101 to 110 in the full UK 200 ranking, is £199m, 15 per cent of the total £1.3bn of revenues of the bottom 100. In comparison the total revenue of the top 10 in the top 100 group (firms one to 10) is £10.9bn, 57 per cent of the total £19.2bn revenue of the top 100. This data sharply puts into context how extraordinarily narrow the turnover range of this group of firms is, how fragmented a group the Independents is, notably regionally, and ultimately why there is still significant pressure for consolidation in the UK market. Turnover implications The bar chart, right, further underlines this theme. It slices the 100 firms in the Independents into four bands: those with a turnover of less than £10m; £10m to £15m; £15m to £20m; and above £20m. The results are startling. The biggest single group of firms is the £10m to £15m revenue bracket. Almost three-quarters of the entire second 100 have a turnover between £10m and £20m. A second chart, published in the full UK 200: The Independents report, slices it into smaller turnover bands of £2m: less than £8m; £8m to £10m; £10m to £12m and so on up until the £20m+ band. This, more granular, breakdown of the second 100 reveals that the biggest number of firms (20 in total) fall into the £10m to £12m bracket. The three other brackets with the highest number of firms are £14m to £16m with 18, £8m to £10m with 17, and £12m to £14m, which has 15 firms. In short, the great majority of firms in the Independents have a turnover between £8m and £16m (only 22 firms fall into the three largest brackets from £16m to £20m+ while seven firms fall into the sub-£8m bracket). “It’s a fascinating part of the market,” says Lee Grunnell of consultancy Thirteen. “The average revenue of these firms is around £12m, and too many of them claim to be able to do too much. The idea that an £8m or £10m firm can genuinely be full service? Be realistic.” The data compiled this year on the firms in the entire UK 200 suggests that size really does matter. The median average revenue per lawyer in the Independents is £204,068. In the top 100 it is £269,417 (32 per cent higher). It is a similar story when you compare revenue per fee-earner. In the bottom half of the table the median average is £133,753. In the top half it is £200,628 (50 per cent higher). The most significant differential comes when revenue per partner data is compared. In the bottom half this stands at £482,125. In the top half it is £758,780 (57 per cent higher). In other words, the larger you are, the more money you generate on a per fee-earner basis. As Shakespeare Martineau CEO Andy Raynor, whose firm has grown from less than £10m to £75m in less than a decade after a string of mergers, puts it, “there was a time when for us it was all about getting scale just so that it would put us in a position to make decisions. The original spur was, we realised, that it is very difficult to compete with larger firms without growing yourself. But now it’s not just about getting bigger. We’re beyond that now.” Moore Blatch, placed at 101 Financials and firm overview After a revenue decline in 2013/14, Hampshire’s Moore Blatch returned to growth last year. Revenue rose back past £20m, to £20.9m – up 10 per cent from £19.02m. Managing partner David Thompson said the firm met its target and was down to previous investment in the firm bearing fruit. Revenue per lawyer (RPL) was £215,000. This was up from the previous year’s £226,000 although still some way off Moore Blatch’s five-year high for this metric. That came in 2011/12, when it was £296,000. Strategy Thompson said Moore Blatch was investing in property-related work, especially rural, agricultural and landed estates matters. The firm is also targeting SMEs and mid-market firms, mainly in the £5m to £50m bracket, going up to £100m. It hopes to grow its commercial offering by structuring its departments to handle the legal services both those types of business require – less bespoke solutions for the smaller businesses and more tailored work for mid-sizers. The firm won The Lawyer’s 2015 ABS of the Year award for Aspire Law, its partnership with spinal injury charity Aspire. The firm and the charity share the profits from the venture 50:50. Moore Blatch is now looking into how it can grow the initiative, as well as what it can do with other charities. Business mix Almost half (49 per cent) of Moore Blatch’s revenue comes from litigious work, with personal injury and insurance litigation making up 33 per cent of total revenue and other litigation and arbitration contributing 16 per cent. This is a decrease from last year, when contentious matters accounted for 57 per cent of turnover. Corporate made up 11 per cent (up from 9 per cent) while property contributed 30 per cent (up from 24 per cent). Personnel After two years when the firm’s lawyer numbers stayed largely static, numbers rose considerably in 2014/15. Most notably, the number of partners jumped by a third, from 30 to 40. This was down to six internal promotions and four lateral hires. The number of equity partners remained static at 11, however. The number of female partners rose from 9 to 15, none of them members of the equity. The total number of lawyers, partners included, rose from 84 to 97, and the total number of fee-earners rose from 145 to 169. Clients Moore Blatch’s clients include Axell Wireless, BDW Trading, Churchill Retirement Living, Commercial First, Covea Insurance and London-based bar group Drake & Morgan. Business services The firm has 113 staff employed in business services groups, including 99 people in secretarial and document production roles and 13 in finance. Property The firm spent £1.3m on 45,000sq ft across its six offices, including 1,000sq ft in London. Financial management/remuneration structure Moore Blatch’s clinical and professional negligence work means its lock-up tends to be high, rising to 978 days in 2013/14. The firm did much better last year, with 349 days of work-in progress (WIP) and 52 debtor days giving total lock-up of 401 days. Managing partner David Thompson said this was due to factors including: an increase in business through the firm’s London and Richmond offices with client matters having shorter life cycles; improved WIP, billing and credit control management; and possibly a number of large litigation, injury and clinical negligence matters concluding together with a reformatting of parts of the business. Debt stood at £5.6m last year, up from £3.28m the previous year. The firm has undertaken several investment projects in recent years, such as renovating its entire Grade II-listed Richmond office and investing in a new project management system. Difference in the detail In the complete Independents report we examine in detail many of these issues and highlight some of the innovative ways firms across the entire group are responding. Inevitably some firms are doing this better than others – we delve into a selection of stand-out performers in the full report, highlight the biggest risers and fallers in terms of revenue and, along with insights, look into the causes of both. And of course, every single firm in the 100-strong list has its own analysis complete with benchmarking data. Indeed there is an absolute wealth of data in The UK 200: The Independents report, much of it new to The Lawyer’s coverage. It includes staffing ratios, an important measure of efficiency, as well as all of the regular metrics such as revenue per partner, lawyer and fee-earner. The analysis focuses on a range of key information such as headline financials, strategy, personnel, financial management and real estate. More detail on the latter for many of the firms in the Independents can be found in The Lawyer UK 200: Real Estate Report, published 14 September, while later this year separate and new reports in the UK 200 series will also examine in more detail cash-flow and debt, business services staff and diversity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:14:39.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
