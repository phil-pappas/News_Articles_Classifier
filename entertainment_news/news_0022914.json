Other luminaries who have witnessed their spectacles include at least two French presidents and more than a few prime ministers of India. \nDuring the past 15 years, the Bollywood Masala Orchestra and Dancers of India have traveled to more than 85 countries. The Society for the Performing Arts on Thursday will present the company in Houston; the group's extensive current tour already has taken it to Spain, France, Germany, Italy and Belgium. \nArtistic director Rahis Bharti says the company's members consider themselves \"cultural ambassadors from (the state of) Rajasthan.\" He was calling as he rode on a bus along the California coast. \"Bollywood goes to Hollywood, finally!\" he said. More Information \nBollywood Masala Orchestra and Dancers of India \nWhen: 8 p.m. Thursday \nWhere: Wortham Theater Center, 501 Texas \nTickets: $28-$73; 713-227-4772, spahouston.org \n\nIf your most recent favorite feel-good movie was either the first or second \"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\" you don't want to miss this show. Like that popular film, the city of Jaipur plays a big part in the story. For anyone, the one-night-only performance is a rare chance to experience both the past and present music of northern India. \nIn Houston, for example, Bharti hopes to present \"Nimbooda,\" a traditional Rajasthani song, along with assorted melodies and dances from the royal courts of the great Maharajas. Bharti, who was born in Jaipur, spent his childhood learning to play tabla, the classic pair of hand-drums that includes a \"dayan\" and a \"bayan.\" \n\"I want to tell you, I was born into a family of musicians. For many generations, we are a family of musicians from Rajasthan. I traveled with the gypsies of Rajasthan all around the world, and still, I wanted to make something new,\" he explained. \nPart of that intent includes a stunning integration of Western instruments, such as brass, into his ensemble. \"The British brought those instruments to India,\" Bharti explained, \"but we already had our own melodies.\" \nWhile Indian wedding bands include brass instruments, it's unusual for them to play classical Indian music. Most often, the bands play in private parades in November and December, the country's \"wedding season.\" \nThe sound is a strange and compelling music, with Eastern scales emerging from trombones, French horns and trumpets. \nThe ensemble's other innovations seem so simple, it's almost perplexing. \"Even in Bollywood,\" Bharti said, \"you rarely hear a live orchestra.\" As a musician, he wants audiences to feel the excitement that comes only when dancers interact with live musicians. \nBharti promises even more than music and dance. \"There will be acrobats, a fakir and the classic snake-charming dance,\" he said. Will there be live cobras? \"No, no live cobras,\" he said, seriously, \"but the women will dance in black dresses, inspired by the cobra. This is one of the most ancient dances from Rajasthan, and it has only ever been done in Rajasthan.\" Entertainment News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:12:46.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
