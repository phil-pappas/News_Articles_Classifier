Pinckney had no Republican opponent in 2004 and 2008. Four years later, he defeated a Republican candidate 66 to 34 percent.\nThe district includes parts of Jasper, Beaufort, Hampton, Colleton, Allendale and Charleston counties.\n\"Jasper is ideally situated, I think, for some really large corporations to come there with the (future Jasper port) and how close they are to Savannah (and) the interstate,\" Matthews said Monday.\nAs for the state's roadways, she has been open about her support for raising South Carolina's gas tax, which has not increased since 1987. Revenue from the per-gallon tax helps fund and maintain road projects.\nSome have estimated the cost to rebuild roadways will exceed $1 billion in the wake of catastrophic flooding this month. Matthews predicted a necessary shift in the political debate.\n\"I hope it becomes a more realistic option,\" she said of a proposed gas-tax increase, adding that it would be the most immediate remedy but one among several that will be needed.\nMatthews raised more than $80,000 in a crowded Democratic primary and a runoff.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:11:16.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
