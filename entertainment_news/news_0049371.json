The story follows the misadventures of speed demon Mr Toad and his friends after he has been imprisoned for theft and his home overtaken by weasels.\nFellowes said: \"I could not be more pleased to have been working on this new production of The Wind In The Willows, which has been a favourite of mine literally all my life. It has been a real privilege to be part of the team re-imagining it for the musical stage.\"\nHendry added: \"I am delighted that we will be opening The Wind In The Willows in two of the country's most prestigious venues prior to the West End. It has been a joy working with such a distinguished team of writers and creatives to develop that rare thing - a new British musical. I can't wait to get the show on the road and invite audiences to share in our journey next year!\"\nShare article The musical hit the headlines last February when it became the first West End musical to rasie £1 million through crowdfunding, with fans able to invest from as little as £1,000.
