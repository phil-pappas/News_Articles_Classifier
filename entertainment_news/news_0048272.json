Clinton will appear alongside cast member Kate McKinnon, who plays the candidate on the show. \nAccording to the Times, Clinton's appearance will take place during \"the cold open,\" the segment of the show when the cast yells the signature phrase, \"live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" \nClinton hinted at the appearance during a television interview in with 7 News in Boston: \"I have fun doing this,\" she said. \"I've been on it before ... I'm just looking to have a good time. I think we have a fun deficit in our country. I'm going to try to fill that one, too.\" \nThe Times noted, however, that SNL creator Lorne Michaels is \"well known for being tight-lipped about guests and has even changed the lineup at the last minute\" and that this could be \"a possibility\" with Clinton. \nClinton's campaign staff and an NBC spokesperson wouldn't confirm her SNL appearance. \nFor Clinton, this will be another in a recent flurry of appearances intended to show off her lighter side to voters. \nShe recently played along with Jimmy Fallon's Donald Trump impression and did the popular dance \"Whip/Nae Nae\" on \"Ellen\" last month. \nAs for \"Saturday Night Live,\" the long-time comedy establishment looks to come roaring out of the gates thanks to its apparent secret Clinton appearance, along with having bombastic pop star Miley Cyrus as its host. \nWhile not much is known about the sketch, it would not be surprising to see Clinton cross paths with \"SNL\" cast member Taran Killam, who won the coveted role of playing Trump on the show. \nThere are also indications that Trump could be on the show this season. When asked on CNN's \"New Day\" last week, Trump answered, \"I'm not allowed to say.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
