Photo by Scott Gries/Getty Images Cream fans can add a new item to their upcoming holiday season list. Ahead of the 50th anniversary of British power trio's 1966 debut single \"Wrapping Paper/Cat's Squirrel,\" Universal will release a new vinyl box set Cream: The Singles 1967-1970 on Dec. 4\nAccording to an article posted Oct. 19 at Classic Rock , the set features of all ten 7\" original mono singles from the psychedelic blues-rock pioneers, which consisted of Ginger Baker , the late Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton . Many of the singles have been unavailable for decades such as the aforementioned debut single, as well as \"Anyone For Tennis’/‘Pressed Rat And Warthog.\"\nIncluded along with the rarities are Creams' well known hits like \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" \"White Room\" and \"Badge.\" The singles are presented in all-new sleeve designs, with reproduced original labels and track-by-track liner notes by respected music writer, Daryl Easlea.\nOne of most influential rock bands of their era, the hugely talented but fractious supergroup disbanded after only two years together in 1969. They reunited only twice, once to perform at their 1993 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and again in 2005 for a short series of concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall and New York's Madison Square Garden. Most recently, Cream received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006 prior to the death of lead singer/bassist Jack Bruce, who died on Oct. 25, 2014.\nSee below for the complete tracklisting Cream: The Singles 1967-1970 .
