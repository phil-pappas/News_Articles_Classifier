The Don't Be Tardy star is also going to undergo surgery to correct it. \n\"I have one of the top cardiologists in the country, who's amazing,\" Zolciak told E! News of the already scheduled surgery. \"Anything that has to do with you heart and brain is pretty scary, but heck, I've been through it. I'm OK.\" \nThe reality star was eliminated from Dancing with the Stars September 29 after suffering a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, five days earlier that put her in the hospital for two days. \nZolciak-Biermann also revealed the condition runs in her family. \"My aunt also has the same exact thing with the exact same story at the exact same age, which is crazy,\" she explained. \nThe mother of six, who gathered more than 200,000 signatures on a petition to bring her and her partner back to the Dancing with the Stars ballroom, will eventually return. She's set to appear on the series' season finale, though there's no word yet if she'll dance. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:52:51.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
