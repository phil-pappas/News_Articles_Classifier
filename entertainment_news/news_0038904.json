Ebenhack, File) \nLOS ANGELES, Calif. - Bill Cosby has replaced his longtime lawyer in a pair of lawsuits filed by women claiming they were sexually abused by the comedian decades ago. \nCosby's new attorney, Christopher Tayback, filed a form on Friday reflecting that he was replacing Cosby's longtime attorney, Martin Singer, in the case. Singer had been defending Cosby in a lawsuit filed by Judy Huth, a Riverside County woman who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion around 1974 when she was 15 years old. \nNo reason for the change is stated in the court filing. \nSinger says his firm has also been replaced in a defamation lawsuit filed by model Janice Dickinson against Cosby, who she says drugged and raped her in Lake Tahoe, California, in 1982. \n\"Our firm has substituted out of the cases and I'm not going to comment on that, however we're happy to assist in the transition of the cases to the new attorneys,\" Singer said Tuesday. \nThe development was first reported Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times. \nCosby has suffered several legal setbacks in Huth's case and a defamation lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by three women who claim they were sexually abused by the comedian. A judge refused to dismiss the Massachusetts case on Oct. 9, the same day the comedian was deposed in Huth's lawsuit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:33:45.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
