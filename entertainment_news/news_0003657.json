These sensors are embedded in machineries for machine vibration monitoring. This helps in measurement of variation in the distance between the shaft and it support bearing. In addition, these sensors are also used in smart devices such as smartphones and tablets to detect accidental touch screen taps when held to the ear for calls. There sensors are in demand due to the increasing demand for automated machineries in various industries such as automotive, food and beverages and process industries among others. In addition, the price of these sensors are falling drastically which is acting as a driver of this market.\n\nThe global proximity and displacement sensors market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This is due to increasing demand for automation and the importance of feedback based production in all the industries. In addition, the growing awareness of safety in automobiles is also driving the market. Presently, the automotive industry holds the majority of the market and is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period. In addition, the introduction of unique safety features such as parking assist, automatic cruise control, side assist and lane assist in automobile is giving a boost to the use of proximity and displacement sensors market. Moreover, the use of these sensors in the process industries is also growing rapidly. Furthermore, the increasing concern for healthy living is increasing the demand of wearable technology which also uses proximity and displacement sensors.\n\nAdoption of high end technologies and the concept of nanotechnology is also creating new opportunities for the proximity and displacement sensors manufacturers globally.
