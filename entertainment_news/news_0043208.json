Also in attendance was professional soccer player Aaron Wheeler , of the Wilmington Hammerheads, Fox 29's Alex Holley and local lifestyle blogger Ian M Crumm . Fallon in town tonight Although we press won't be allowed anywhere near him (so I'm told), recently injured Jimmy Fallon is expected to join his \"Tonight Show\" band, the Roots , tonight at the 2015 Philadelphia Music Alliance Walk of Fame gala at Philly's newest music venue, the Fillmore (1100 Canal St.). Fallon, who busted up his hand Saturday night in Cambridge, Mass., will try to get here to induct his house band into PMA's Class of 2015, which earns them a permanent position among hometown music icons along the Avenue of the Arts, on South Broad Street.\nSources say Fallon will be coming to Philly directly from a New York taping of \"Tonight\" and be personally presenting the band with their ceremonial plaque. D.A. race gets ugly \nThe race for district attorney in Montgomery County is certainly heating up. \nLast week, Democrat and First Assistant District Attorney Kevin Steele put out a 30-second ad titled \"Tough,\" in which he accuses former D.A. Bruce Castor of \"not looking out for the [alleged] victims\" of Bill Cosby , and wherein he touts a 98 percent conviction rate of criminals. \nDays later, Castor, the Republican candidate, fired back with his own ad, called \"Trust,\" pointing out that the women who came forward against Cosby in recent years did so only after he left the D.A.'s office and lost the power to levy criminal charges. \n\"He is still a prosecutor who chose to do nothing at all,\" Castor says. \n\"Despicable, desperation politics. Disgusting lies. Kevin Steele had the power to help victims of Cosby, but he sat on his hands.\" Hamels gives back Though he pitches for a different team these days, Cole Hamels is still putting his money back in the town that gave him his start(s).\nThe Hamels Foundation recently announced it will be awarding $10,000 in grants to two local nonprofits: the Police Athletic League and the Valley Youth House (42 S. 15th St.). \nEach year, the former Phillie and his wife, Heidi , give grants to nonprofits in the Philly area from their foundation. \n\"These two amazing organizations both play a vital role in meeting the needs of youth in our community,\" Cole Hamels said. \n\"We are proud to continue to support youth programs throughout Philadelphia and look forward to doing so in the future.\" Flyer hosts CHOP kids Flyers right winger Jakub Voracek hosted several pediatric cancer patients and their families in his suite Saturday night. \nThe kids, who are being treated at CHOP (3401 Civic Center Blvd.), got the special treatment as part of Flyers Hockey Fights Cancer Night. Sources say Voracek met with each after the game and presented them with a special No. 93 autographed Flyers jersey. \nOn Twitter: @PhillyGossipDN \nOnline: ph.ly/DNGossip", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:38:10.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
