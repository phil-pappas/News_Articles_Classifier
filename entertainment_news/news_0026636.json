Since her daughter's birth last December, the actress has been open about her struggle with postpartum depression and recently discussed it on LIVE with Kelly and Michael as an issue that deserves more attention and discussion. \nHayden Panettiere reveals her struggle with postpartum depression \n\"When they tell you about postpartum depression you think it's, 'I feel negative feelings toward my child, I want to injure my child, I want to hurt my child.' I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on,\" she said. \"Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal.\" \nArt is also imitating life for Panettiere, whose Nashville character Juliette is dealing with her own postpartum depression this season. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:53:36.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
