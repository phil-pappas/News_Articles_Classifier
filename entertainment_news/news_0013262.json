It appeared imprudent to many, even though Cambria has represented the magazine's publisher, Larry Flynt, for decades.\nOf course, Cambria has never cared much for propriety.\nOver 40 years, Cambria has built a successful career as a criminal defense attorney but is mostly known as a leading First Amendment lawyer with a roster of celebrity clients that includes the musician Marilyn Manson, the rapper DMX and Flynt, the pornography pioneer. Along the way, he has mastered the ability to ignore public opinion while championing high-profile clients in career-threatening situations.\n\"If they don't like you, they try to pick things that are negative. And so they'll go, 'oh, you know Kane's got a porn lawyer,'\" he said. \"Well guess what? Kane's got a lawyer that's as qualified as anybody in the world as far as criminal defense is concerned.\"\nKane faces an ongoing criminal investigation following a woman's claim that the 26-year-old Blackhawks winger raped her at his lakefront mansion in Hamburg, N.Y. in early August. As the case stretches into its tenth week, Cambria has become the voice for Kane after refraining from commenting for nearly two months. Two weeks ago, as the investigation spun into chaos, he held three press conferences, including one in his suburban home, and seized those opportunities on live television to portray Kane as the victim.\nLawyer with Kanes David Duprey / AP Attorney Paul Cambria, far left, walks with Blackhawks player Patrick Kane, second from right, and his parents, Donna and Pat Kane, in August 2009 on their way to court in Buffalo, N.Y., when the hockey star was accused of assaulting a taxi driver.

(David Duprey / AP) Indeed, the high-profile nature of the Kane case is familiar territory for the media-savvy lawyer. At 68, he is considered among the best criminal defense attorneys in western New York, an accomplished litigator who cites Perry Mason as his inspiration and vows never to retire.\n\"Nobody wants to do this anymore,\" Cambria said of criminal defense. \"They all want to be accident lawyers. Insurance companies pay their bills and they can get huge recoveries. Criminal defense work is not only tough but people have to be able to afford you.\"\nCambria, who has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, began representing Flynt in the 1970s when he was an associate at a Buffalo firm; he remains the publisher's general counsel. Like other clients and colleagues, Flynt described Cambria as an aggressive lawyer, but also one who has the ability to help reshape a porn peddler as a First Amendment crusader.\n\"Paul is a bulldog in the courtroom,\" Flynt told the Tribune. \"He loves to go to battle for his clients, and he loves to win.\"\nPatrick Kane accuser will cooperate with hoax investigation: attorney Jared S.

Hopkins and Stacy St. Clair) The walls of Cambria's office are adorned with mementos of a busy career: a few dozen photos, his clients' gifts, and legal trophies: a commemorative Manson CD; a drawing of Cambria arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court; plaques from legal groups honoring him; two photos with Arnold Schwarzenegger, a motorcycle-riding comrade; even a photograph with a race car that has the Hustler logo splashed across its side.\n\"Paul is a very high-profile defense lawyer, very aggressive and very knowledgeable,\" said former Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark. \"If I were to pick the top three or four defense lawyers, he'd be on my list.\"\nWith his fireplug-build and flat western New York accent, Cambria regularly appears on local radio and television to opine about cases other than his own. But not every attorney admires Cambria's bravado, and some say he's looking out for himself more than anyone else.\n\"The center of Paul Cambria's life is Paul Cambria,\" said Joseph Terranova, a local criminal defense attorney. \"Lawyers don't like him. Judges don't like him. Prosecutors hate him. He's got to pull teeth out to get people to talk to him.\"\nCambria downplays criticism, dismissing it as jealous hyperbole from competing attorneys. Instead, he describes himself as a \"small-town guy who prides himself on being a hard worker and honest lawyer.\"\nCambria grew up in Fredonia, a village of about 10,000 an hour's drive southwest of Buffalo. His father was a mechanic, and he was the first person in his family to graduate from college. He chose University of Toledo's law school because of its law clinic, which he says allowed him to assist the local district attorney with cases while still in school.\nUpon graduation, he began working under Herald Fahringer, a well-known New York attorney who represented clients prosecuted for free-speech violations. Among those clients: Al Goldstein, the hardcore pornographer and publisher of Screw magazine. As Cambria tells it, Fahringer was out of the office on a case one day in the 1970s, so he took a phone call from Flynt, who at the time had recently launched Hustler. He soon hired the firm.\nIn 1978, Flynt and one of his other attorneys were shot on the sidewalk outside a Georgia courthouse during an obscenity trial. Cambria was in a phone booth nearby calling his secretary in Buffalo.\n\"All of a sudden I hear 'pop, pop, pop,' and down they go, both of them,\" he said.\nFlynt and the other lawyer both survived, although the publisher was paralyzed from the waist down.\nBack in Buffalo, Cambria quickly distinguished himself within the legal community, and by the early 1980s was appearing on magazine covers with attorneys who were more experienced.\nCambria cemented his role as the legal defender of the porn industry 15 years ago, when he was asked by a production company to determine which sex acts would run afoul with authorities. The memo — which became known as \"Cambria's List\" — recommends staying away from activities such as bestiality, incest, necrophilia and other colorful, sometimes lurid, acts. Cambria said he listed only five or six acts and his client added the rest.\n\"And then that was published and republished and republished and passed around by hand to all of these various companies and it became the 'Cambria List,'\" he said. \"It was simply me identifying those topics most frequently selected by the police.\"\nDespite all the years and billable hours, the association with porn rankles Cambria. His life, he said, is about more than just defending smut. He's a father of four daughters and raises his two nieces. He and his wife, Paula, own an Italian restaurant in their affluent Buffalo suburb and have spent years competitively drag racing cars around the country. He also helps raise millions of dollars for a local children's and women's hospital.\nThis year, he was named one of the city's three legal \"giants\" by the Buffalo History Museum because of his track record. Of all the files stacked on his desk, he lifted up the only one related to the porn industry — one involving Measure B, a law requiring the use of condoms in most sex scenes filmed in Los Angeles County. Pornography cases, he said, have never made up more than 1 percent of his caseload.\nMinutes later, he rose from his chair and pulled off a shelf an early edition of Best Lawyers in America published three decades ago.\n\"I'm in it, and I'm in it every single year from that year till today,\" he said. \"And I'm not in there for First Amendment stuff. I'm in there for criminal defense.\"\nProminent Chicago attorney Ed Genson worked alongside Cambria on an international money laundering case in the 1990s, when they spent several weeks together in Switzerland. Genson said Cambria was smart and flamboyant, the kind of showy lawyer whose courtroom performance played well with juries.\n\"Times are different in the courtroom now,\" Genson said. \"Flamboyancy doesn't work as well. But he's very bright and he figures out what does work.\"\nThose skills were on display two weeks ago after the lawyer for Kane's 21-year-old accuser, prominent Buffalo attorney Thomas Eoannou, alleged that a bag that once contained the rape kit from the case was anonymously left at his client's mother's home.\nMinutes after the tampering allegation, Cambria held his own news conference, where he shook his head and said he had been given no choice but to reveal that DNA evidence showed no traces of Kane's genetic profile below the accuser's waist.\nHe predicted — rightly, it turns out — that Eoannou's accusation would backfire. Two days later Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III said his office had investigated the bag allegation and concluded it was a hoax.\nBy the end of that bizarre week, Cambria had steered the public conversation toward apparent weaknesses in the case against Kane. It was a testament, legal experts said, to Cambria's calculated command.\n\"It was a masterful use of the media by a seasoned defense attorney before the case even hit a courtroom,\" said Florina Altshiler, a former sex crimes prosecutor now in private practice in Buffalo.\nDespite their tense exchange in the media, Cambria and Eoannou are friends, not surprising for two respected lawyers in a small city like Buffalo. In fact, Cambria's family used to spend July Fourth weekends at Eoannou's house.\nKane hired Cambria in 2009 when he was arrested on charges of assaulting a taxi driver in Buffalo with his cousin. Like many in Buffalo, Cambria knew the family: He bought two Jeeps at a car dealership owned by Kane's family.\nCambria said he speaks with Kane daily, debriefing him on the case's developments.\nSedita has not decided if the case will return to a grand jury, which then would decide whether Kane should be charged criminally. Regardless of the outcome, Cambria expects Kane's accuser to file a civil lawsuit against his client. Though Eoannou withdrew from the case, the woman still is represented by one of the top personal injury attorneys in the city.\nThe accuser's spokesman declined to comment, and her attorney could not be reached.\nAs for Cambria, he dismisses the possibility of removing the Hustler mug the next time the cameras are on.\nHe doesn't understand the fuss. Or at least he claims he doesn't.\n\"It baffles me what people are interested in,\" Cambria said. \"It's a freaking mug!\"\nJared S.
