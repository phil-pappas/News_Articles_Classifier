We adjust EBITDA to exclude the impact of other income, loss on change in value of derivatives as well as certain other charges discussed below. This measure is one of the primary Non-GAAP financial measures on which we (i) evaluate the performance of our on-going core operating results period over period, (ii) base our internal budgets and (iii) compensate management. As such, adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial performance measure that excludes (if applicable): (i) certain adjustments as a result of the purchase price accounting for the Merger, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) other significant operating expense (income) that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business. The purchase price accounting adjustments include: (i) the elimination of deferred revenue associated with the investment in XM Canada, (ii) recognition of deferred subscriber revenues not recognized in purchase price accounting, and (iii) elimination of the benefit of deferred credits on executory contracts, which are primarily attributable to third party arrangements with programming providers. We believe adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of our operating performance, which provides useful information about our business apart from the costs associated with our physical plant, capital structure and purchase price accounting. We believe investors find this Non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing our results and comparing our operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment and media companies. We believe investors use current and projected adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current and prospective enterprise value and to make investment decisions. Because we fund and build-out our satellite radio system through the periodic raising and expenditure of large amounts of capital, our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense is useful given significant variation in depreciation and amortization expense that can result from the potential variations in estimated useful lives, all of which can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. We believe the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful given share-based payment expense is not directly related to the operational conditions of our business. We also believe the exclusion of the portion of the pre-1972 sound recordings legal settlement recognized in June 2015 is useful as it does not represent an expense incurred as part of normal operations for the period. The portion of the pre-1972 sound recordings legal settlement related to the period of July 2015 through December 2017 is not excluded from adjusted EBITDA as the royalty expense relates to the on-going performance of our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense and certain purchase price accounting for the Merger. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the Non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the Non-GAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate our operating results after giving effect for these costs, should refer to net income as disclosed in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial performance measure, our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:\nUnaudited\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands)\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nNet income (GAAP):\n$ 166,550\n$ 136,170\n$ 375,091\n$ 350,119\nAdd back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA:\nPurchase price accounting adjustments:\nRevenues\n1,813\n1,813\n5,438\n5,438\nOperating expenses\n-\n(945)\n(1,394)\n(2,835)\nPre-1972 sound recordings legal settlement (GAAP)\n-\n-\n107,658\n-\nShare-based payment expense (GAAP)\n23,393\n21,805\n62,334\n57,832\nDepreciation and amortization (GAAP)\n70,404\n64,550\n202,527\n200,021\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized (GAAP)\n76,624\n75,416\n221,912\n197,029\nLoss on change in value of derivatives (GAAP)\n-\n-\n-\n34,485\nOther income (GAAP)\n(4,133)\n(6,602)\n(9,077)\n(8,234)\nIncome tax expense (GAAP)\n112,543\n89,044\n296,893\n252,614\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 447,194\n$ 381,251\n$ 1,261,382\n$ 1,086,469\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - We define these Non-GAAP financial measures as our actual net income adjusted to exclude the impact of certain purchase price accounting adjustments, the loss on change in value of derivatives, and the pre-1972 sound recordings legal settlement, net of income tax expense.

At the time satellite radio enabled vehicles are sold or leased, the owners or lessees generally receive trial subscriptions ranging from three to twelve months. We measure conversion rate three months after the period in which the trial service ends. The metric excludes rental and fleet vehicles.\nSubscriber acquisition cost, per installation - or SAC, per installation, is derived from subscriber acquisition costs and margins from the sale of radios and accessories, divided by the number of satellite radio installations in new vehicles and shipments of aftermarket radios for the period.
