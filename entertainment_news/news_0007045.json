Abrams take on the \"Star Wars\" saga, which looks to continue its momentum tonight during halftime of the New York Giants versus Philadelphia Eagles' \"Monday Night Football\" game on ESPN. \nFans will see a third trailer for \"The Force Awakens\" tonight, with it perhaps offering a greater glimpse into what the film's story has to offer. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" opens in theaters on Dec. 18, 2015. (Disney) \nNot that we die-hard \"Star Wars\" fans need anymore incentive to see this or any future movies after the first two trailers -- or let's face it, the announcement that this would even happen -- it wouldn't hurt to see just a bit more. \nI personally know fans who plan to skip tonight's trailer and any future trailers Abrams and his pals at Disney care to show prior to this film's Dec. 18, 2015 release in theaters simply because they're already sold and want to stay as fresh as possible when they finally see it. \nHey, I get that. But me? I want to know at least a little about the story via whatever the typically secretive Abrams chooses to show us. That guy respects his audience and wouldn't let us see anything that might compromise the integrity of the story or overall experience, so I'll watch tonight and will then likely shut it down until Dec. 18. \nIn the meantime, Lucasfilm dropped the newest poster for \"The Force Awakens\" this past weekend, and it's an absolutely beauty, one I'm sure you'll find on the walls of true fans, their kids and otherwise in the near future. On Sunday morning, I showed the image to my dad, a \"Star Wars\" fan who did not care for the prequels, and he said, \"Yeah, that's more like it.\" I'm guessing the world agrees. \nSo if you choose to watch, enjoy tonight's new glimpse at \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" which will surely prove at least more entertaining than the NFC East battle sandwiching its premiere. \nAt your own risk, watch these super-short clips of tonight's newest trailer for \"The Force Awakens,\" as seen via the \"Star Wars\" Instagram account.
