It should be both challenging and rewarding.\"\nWhile training at the elite level can be grueling, the monthly developmental camps provide stepping stones to the big stage. Under the direction of 1988 Olympic gold medalist and Development Team Coordinator, Valeri Liukin, the participants practice basic gymnastics fundamentals and physical abilities testing, along with upgraded skills and combinations. The developmental camps prepare the gymnasts for top elite competitions, such as HOPES Championships, Secret U.S. Classic, P&G Championships, and ultimately a spot on the Junior National Team.\nWilliams participated in the September developmental camp and is no stranger to competing with the country’s top talent. As a Level 10 gymnast, Williams qualified to the 2015 Junior Olympic National Championships, placing 33rd in the all-around. At the 2015 Region 1 Championships, Williams won gold on uneven bars (9.625) and balance beam (9.675). Williams also took second place in the all-around with an impressive 37.225. Additionally, Williams was crowned the NorCal State Champion on uneven bars, scoring 9.575.\nFor more information about any of Head Over Heels Athletics Arts classes and programs, call 510-655-1265, view the various gymnastics programs on the web at http://www.hohathleticarts.com , or visit 4701 Doyle St., Building F, in Emeryville.\nAbout Head Over Heels Athletic Arts:\nHead Over Heels Athletic Arts has been helping children gain fitness, gymnastics skills, confidence and self-esteem for nearly 40 years.
