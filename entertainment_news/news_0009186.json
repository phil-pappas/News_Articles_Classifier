An evolution of the sport of supercross, the event features head-to-head racing on an \"unwound\" track, where there are no turns, just a 1/2 mile-long straight track complete with 75 jumps and a 400-foot long whoops section, likely having riders spend more time airborne than on the ground. The event will be broadcast live and on demand beginning October 10 th at 12:30pm PT on Red Bull TV as part of the Red Bull Signature Series, a collection of the most innovative and progressive events in action sports.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7627331-red-bull-signature-series/\nThe inaugural event saw supercross legend James Stewart win the Open Class, with Marvin Musquin taking home the top spot in the 250cc Class. This year's format will feature 24 riders broken up into two classes – 16 riders in the Open Class and 8 riders in the Lites Class (less than 250cc). Riders will race in a head-to-head, best-of-three bracket format. By isolating just the whoops, doubles, table tops and step on/offs, this format demands that riders focus exclusively on reading the terrain in front of them and correctly judging their speed / throttle input for precise distance and control over the features. Many of the world's top riders are expected to return to the competition.\nJames Stewart's participation in the event will mark his return to professional racing. After a year off, he'll look to come back with a bang and defend his title at the unique head-to-head event. This year's AMA Supercross and Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Champion Ryan Dungey will look to keep his winning streak going on the ½ mile, straight track. Justin Brayton will return to try and improve on his second place finish last year, and Marvin Musquin, who dominated the Lites Class in 2014, will move up to the Open Class. Riders new to this event include Ken Roczen , Andrew Short and holeshot specialist Mike Alessi .\n\"The Red Bull Straight Rhythm course demands a style of riding unlike the traditional tracks we face all year long. Ultimately there's less time to recover from a mistake so the goal is to maintain a certain rhythmic tempo. It's a definite challenge,\" said James Stewart , 2014 Red Bull Straight Rhythm Open Class champion.\nThe 3-hour livestream will be accessible via the web at www.redbull.tv and its Android, iOS and Windows Phone applications.
