She’ll pour a cup of coffee, send the kids to school and do her job as a loan officer, same as any other day.\nAnd she will try and fail, and try and fail, to forget what day it is.\n“Of the 365 days each year,” she says, “it is hardest.”\nBecause each Oct. 12 is a personal reminder of the deadliest mass shooting in Orange County history – that day in 2011 when a gunman walked into Salon Meritage in Seal Beach and killed eight, including her sister, and nearly killed another, who was her mom.\n“The anniversary is about him,” Webb says. “It’s a place of darkness. So there is …”\nShe pauses, the words stuck in her throat.\n“No, we don’t do anything. We never plan about it, we never talk about it. We just go our own way.”\nRandy Fannin of Murrieta, a co-owner of the salon, was one of the victims. He died trying to talk the gunman out of firing. His wife, Sandi Fannin, also a co-owner, who could not be reached for this story, survived the attack because she was in the back of the shop.\nFor Sandi and the other relatives of victims, the four-year anniversary serves as a reminder that they are still awaiting justice.\n“My frustrations are at an all-time high,” says Paul Wilson, who lost his wife, Christy, a manicurist at the salon for more than 15 years.\n“It’s a never-ending sadness,” says Rooney Daschbach, who lost his sister, Michele Daschbach Fast, a soccer mom of three who stopped in Salon Meritage for the first time that day.\n“I’m trying to figure out how there ever could be justice,” says Webb, whose sister Laura Webb Elody worked there, and whose mom, Hattie Stretz, just popped in for a haircut and a little pampering.\nThe case against shooter Scott Dekraai, a 41-year-old former tugboat crewman, seemed open-and-shut: Caught a few blocks from the scene with three guns, he told police: “I know what I did.” In court, he pleaded guilty.\nIt appeared the only thing left to decide was whether he should be put to death (at the moment a largely academic sentence in California given a statewide moratorium on capital punishment).\nBut the case took a jaw-dropping detour along the way, shifting focus from the actions of an admitted killer to the actions of the county’s top prosecutor and his staff. In March, Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals removed Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and his office’s 250 attorneys from the case after disclosures that authorities secretly recorded a jailhouse informant questioning Dekraai and withheld evidence from the defense.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw3bim-b88537758z.120151011213514000ghvch8ou.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nw3bim-b88537758z.120151011213514000ghvch8ou.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:06:35.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
