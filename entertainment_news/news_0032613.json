Win or go home, so we’ve got to find a way to win.”\nBeat the Gators (6-1, 4-1) and the Bulldogs would control their own destiny in the SEC East race if Tennessee (3-3, 1-2) falls at Alabama this Saturday.\nCoach Mark Richt moved past Wally Butts into sole possession of No. 2 on Georgia’s all-time wins list with 141, but it came in a game when the Bulldogs scored the the fewest points an SEC team has had winning a conference game since LSU beat Alabama 9-6 in overtime Nov. 5, 2011.\nIt was the fewest in a regulation win since Auburn edged Mississippi State 3-2 on Sept. 13, 2008, and it was the first time Georgia won without scoring a touchdown since beating Kentucky 12-3 in 1995.\n“It really goes down to the basics,“ Richt said of the offensive issues. “It’s hard to be consistent unless you block well and I think it all starts with that. Obviously, there’s some route running that could be more crisp, there’s some balls that could be placed better. We’ve caught the ball pretty good when the ball was within range, so that’s good. We’ve just got to get better in all of those things.”\nLambert was 23 of 32 for 178 yards with an interception and at least three more passes came close to being picked off.\n“My performance has been a roller coaster,” Lambert said of his first season as a graduate transfer from Virginia. “Hopefully this bye week will help me gain some consistency in that, but we’re 5-2 and we’ve got a shot still.”\nGeorgia returned to the coaches’ poll Sunday at No. 25 after a week’s absence but is sixth in others receiving votes in the AP poll.\nThe Bulldogs held Missouri without a touchdown for the second straight season, limiting the Tigers to 164 yards after giving up 147 to them last season.\n“They have a good scheme,” Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said. “They’re good players. They get the matchups and they get off the blocks.”\nThe biggest tackle, though, probably belonged to receiver Kenneth Towns, who ran down Ian Simon at the Georgia 1-yard line after his interception on the first play from scrimmage gave the defense a chance to make a goal-line stand and hold the Tigers to a field goal.\nAfter Marshall Morgan’s onside kick didn’t travel 10 yards in the second quarter giving Missouri the ball at the Georgia 44, the defense forced another three-and-out.\nGeorgia true freshmen Johnantan Abram, Natrez Patrick, Jonathan Ledbetter, Trenton Thompson and Jarvis Wilson accounted for 12 tackles.\nThat helped keep others fresh and “we know guys can’t get better without playing as well,” Richt said. “You can’t just play one deep, I don’t think in our league. You’ve got to keep people fresh, you’ve got to keep developing your younger players and let them gain confidence.”\nThe open date comes at a good time. The team has a lengthy list of players who are nursing injuries.\nThat includes defensive lineman Thompson (ankle), tailback Sony Michel (groin), outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins (hip strain), receiver Isaiah McKenzie (hamstring), center Brandon Kublanow (ankle), defensive lineman John Atkins (turf toe) and receiver Reggie Davis (thigh bruise).\n“Now we’ve got a couple of weeks,” Richt said. “We’ll be sure to rest these guys and get them in position to be as healthy and rested as possible and still have that balance of being prepared as well.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:12:22.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
