In a touch that will hit home with Park Slope parents, there's even a nursery-themed room with ghouls in baby carriages and a sinister clown riding a tricycle. \nBlack lights, smoke machines, sound effects and costumed actors will enhance the spookiness factor, said Capt. Frank DiGiacomo, the precinct's commanding officer. \nHalloween is DiGiacomo's favorite holiday, he told DNAinfo New York. When he was assigned to the precinct in August 2014 and found out about the 84-year-old building's unused basement, he immediately thought it would make an ideal haunted house, he said. \nFirst DiGiacomo and several officers — all of whom donated their time — cleared several thousand pounds of water-damaged files out of the basement and shredded them. Then they turned the rooms into a chamber of horrors complete with walls painted black or blood red and black lights that give the space an eerie glow. \nDiGiacomo paid for most of the props himself (others were donated or paid for by the precinct's community council). He'll use his vacation time this week to supervise the fright-fest. \n\"It's for the community — so they come to the command and meet the police and see them in a different way,\" said DiGiacomo, who will trade in his uniform for a scary costume for the event. \nHe wouldn't reveal which scary character he'll play — to find out, you'll have to visit the haunted house. \nVisit the 78th Precinct for Halloween trick or treating and a haunted house (appropriate for older children) at 65 Sixth Ave. near Dean Street, on Oct. 28, 29 and 30 from 2 to 9 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:26:13.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
