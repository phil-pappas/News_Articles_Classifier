The cast of The Big Bang Theory (Channel 4) \n“I think it would be nice to potentially meet his dad,” he said. \nSam Wolowitz reportedly left his son and his wife Debbie (voiced by the late Carol Ann Susi) when Howard was 11 years old, and has never been seen throughout all nine series of the show. \nSimon continued: “I like it when the writers get deep because it’s hard to do that on a sitcom without hearing the cheesy violin or having that special episode feeling, and they do it so well and I love getting to learn about this character I’ve played and known for over seven years, and getting to discover things I never knew. \n“I don’t write the show, I don’t create any of those aspects so I get a script, open it and find out his dad abandoned him. It’s interesting. I can’t wait to see what they’ve got for us.” Kaley Cuoco, Melissa Rauch, Simon Helberg, Jim Parsons and Mayim Bialik (Jordan Strauss/Invision) \nOne thing the actor is happy with is to remain on the ground, following Howard’s stint in space. \n“I don’t need to go back to space,” he joked. Jocelyn Towne and Simon Helberg (Evan Agostini/Invision) \nSimon – who has made his directorial debut with the film We’ll Never Have Paris, based on his real-life engagement to wife Jocelyn Towne – said starring on The Big Bang Theory has its pros and cons when it comes to being a filmmaker. \n“It definitely helped in many ways, and I also think there are setbacks that come with it too because it’s in a completely different universe that my film exists in. It’s something I’m learning about now, about how those worlds affect each other,” he said. Share article \nWe’ll Never Have Paris is in cinemas now.
