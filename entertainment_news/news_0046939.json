That's why both Andy Grammer and Backstreet Boy Nick Carter will be dancing to their own music tonight, but for different reasons. \nNick and his partner Sharna Burgess will dance to \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" the group's 1997 top five hit, whose monster-themed video features some iconic choreography. The song marked the moment when Backstreet really became well-known worldwide. Meanwhile, Andy and his partner Allison Holker will dance to his brand-new single \"Good to Be Alive,\" since it just so happens that this year is the most memorable of his career, thanks to the success of \"Honey, I'm Good.\" \n\"My new single 'Good to Be Alive,' is exactly the motto for my life right now,\" Andy tells ABC Radio. \"It’s like, it just is good to be alive right now. So I couldn’t complain, even though there isn’t a lot of sleep, but there’s a lot going on.\" \nAndy's lack of sleep is due to the fact that he's both rehearsing for Dancing with the Stars and touring at the same time. But he says he needs one to get over how lame the other makes him feel. \n\"It’s been nice to have these rehearsals suck horribly for, like, seven hours and then go on stage and have your...fans and have songs and be like, 'Oh, totally! This is what I do! I forgot about that!'” he laughs. \"You know? Just for morale, it’s kind of nice.\" \nBeing on Dancing with the Stars is just one of the many opportunities Andy's had since \"Honey, I'm Good\" became the biggest hit of his career. He hints at more opportunities coming down the line, saying, \"There’s like so much good stuff going on. It’s just really good to be alive. It just is.\" \nAndy says even though \"Good to Be Alive\" was specifically inspired by his personal journey of working hard to break through in the music business and coming very close -- but not close enough -- for so many years, he feels the song is very relatable. \n\"I have had success before,\" he explains. \"It’s just that I think everybody can feel that way. This feeling of like, 'Man I’ve been pushing for a really, really long time and I was waiting for like the big opening.' And I think a lot of people in their life have felt that in different ways.\" \n\"Good to Be Alive\" will appear on a re-released version of Andy's album Magazines or Novels , which is coming out November 6. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
