(Starz Digital) Katie Walsh, Tribune Newspapers \"Momentum\" is a whole lot of forward motion without much to back it up or a compelling destination. \nThere's a whole lot of hullabaloo over very little in the very generic action-thriller \"Momentum\" starring former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko. As is typical for almost any film in this genre, there's happens to be a wee little thing that a lot of very violent people are fighting over — in this case it's a tiny hard drive that's been hidden away in a maximum security bank vault in a bag of diamonds. When an enterprising group of professional thieves take it upon themselves to relieve the bank of said diamonds, they end up with a nasty assassin (James Purefoy) on their tails, a \"cleaner\" hired by world leaders to do their dirty work. \nThe film is almost an endless chase scene, starting with the opening heist, which we are thrown directly into as soon as the film starts. There's a futuristic cool aesthetic to the androgynous high-tech suits with vocoders in which the thieves are decked out, even as they blow their own cover with a squabble. It's one last job for Alex (Kurylenko), and all she wants is out, a resolution that is of course complicated by her history with Kevin (Colin Moss). \nThe lifted hard drive is instantly tracked down by the sneering, sadistic Mr. Washington (Purefoy), who enjoys his murderous games of cat-and-mouse just a little too much. He relishes going toe-to-toe with Alex, who, as a former government agent, has all the right moves to keep Washington and his crew guessing, from hotel to car to house to warehouse to airport. Though Washington keeps taking calls from an American senator (Morgan Freeman) as to the hard drive's whereabouts, we don't find out what's on it until the very end, so there are no real stakes. It's just a man chasing a woman trying to get a teeny tiny thing from her. \nThe film, curiously, takes place in South Africa, though the setting seems random and the film doesn't at all incorporate the character of the place into the story. Every location is so generic that it could be anywhere in the world — South Africa exists as an aerial shot and a chyron letting us know where we are. There are a few moments of inspired visuals — director Stephen S. Campanelli is a former camera operator and marks his directorial debut with this film — but they can't carry the paper-thin plot, written by Adam Marcus and Debra Sullivan. \nIn the end, \"Momentum\" is just that — a whole lot of forward motion without much to back it up or a compelling destination. The real bones of the story — the motivation, stakes, political and emotional themes — feel hastily cribbed together from other films, and the storyline seems like a parody of itself. It's an opportunity for Kurylenko to kick some butt, and that she does, with sassy, salty flair. But that's not enough there to make a trip to the theater worth it; catch it on TV for a mindless Saturday afternoon. Momentum (Trailer) \nTrailer for 'Momentum.' Oct. 15, 2015.
