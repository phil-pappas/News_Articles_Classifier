It was such fun to write and an incredible adventure. Furthermore, I think I have a very good story going.\"\nThe Millennium series, which chronicles the adventures of tattooed computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, made Larsson one of the world's best-loved crime writers.\nBut the fame came posthumously, after his death of a heart attack in 2004, a year before the release of the first book in the series, \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\".\nThat book was followed by two others, which together sold over 80 million copies worldwide.\nLagercrantz's first sequel, \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\", which was released in 25 countries on August 27, picks up the trail of the intrepid hacker-hack duo.\nSo far, 2.7 million copies have been printed.\nThe Guardian's reviewer called it \"a respectful and affectionate homage\" but The New York Times concluded \"the sublime madness of Larsson's original isn't quite there.\"\nThe fifth book is scheduled for release in 2017, with the sixth following two years later, Norstedts said.\nWhile many Larsson fans rejoiced over the continuation of the series, some -- including his longtime partner, Eva Gabrielsson -- vehemently opposed Lagercrantz taking up the torch.\nPreviously best known for his biography of footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the writer told AFP in August he was \"scared to death\" his work would not live up to Larsson's legacy.\nArts & Entertainment Books & Publishing Stieg Larsson David Lagercrantz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:30:56.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
