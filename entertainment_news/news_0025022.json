(Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune) Steve Johnson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Day of the Dead exhibit at Pilsen's National Museum of Mexican Art honors departed children, \"The 43.\" \n\"I think the name 'Day of the Dead' scares some people,\" said Cesareo Moreno, chief curator of the National Museum of Mexican Art. \"But it really is a celebration of life and of family more than it is about death.\" \nAt his museum, it is also an annual tradition to mount a Dia de los Muertos exhibition. Curators pack the temporary exhibition galleries at the back of the free Pilsen museum with authentic Day of the Dead pieces and with artists' takes on the tradition and its meanings both here and in Mexico. This year's show, the 29th, is up through Dec. 13. If it is not quite as wholly exuberant as in years past, it is because two somber notes are sounded. \nOne is that the show's curator, Dolores Mercado, melded into the show another death-related Mexican tradition, that of the \"la muerte nina,\" or dead child, painting, typically an image made for a family to remember a child who has died. The other is that the show is dedicated to a deeply resonant event in Mexico, the September 2014 kidnapping and disappearance of 43 teaching college students in Guerrero. \nThe artwork on those themes, however, don't seem out of place alongside Day of the Dead paintings and installations. And the main focus of the 90 artists represented remains the Nov. 1 holiday, which Moreno explained further. \n\"This part of Mexican culture is an overlap of two very distinct views of life and death,\" Moreno said. \"One is the ancient indigenous peoples', who lived here for thousands of years, and the way they viewed death as a part of life. Once the Catholic Europeans arrived via Spain, the idea of All Saints Day (Nov. 1) and All Souls Day (Nov. 2) is really a day in which we remember and pray for those who have passed. So those two ideas came together, and they created what is now known as the Day of the Dead.\" \nOne afternoon earlier this month, Moreno walked the galleries and talked further about six of the works that illustrate the depth and range of this year's show.

(Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune) \n\"Halloween and Day of the Dead,\" Elena Climent, painting: \"So, in this painting we have the obvious connection or influence from Halloween to Day of the Dead. In the United States we see a lot of Day of the Dead materials coming into the culture, being sold at Walgreens, at Jewel; Day of the Dead is certainly something that is not that foreign anymore, like it was 30-some years ago. Likewise, in Mexico, Halloween has started creeping in as well. And what we're seeing now is sort of this combination of Day of the Dead-Halloween. The good thing is that in Mexico they still know the difference. In the U.S. we may not know the difference, the difference being that Day of the Dead is a very sacred day. It's a day in which we welcome back the memory and the souls of those people who are still — are still — an important part of our family, even though they may not be physically present. And it's a sacred day in which a lot of people pray. They gather together. We welcome them back. Halloween, you don't want those ghosts around. You're kind of afraid of them. It's a scary time. It is certainly not a sacred day, and I think those are the big differences between the two. But in the two countries where obviously a lot of cultural influences go back and forth, it's bound to happen. Climent really captures these sort of moments in Mexico where different things overlay each other.\" Day of the Dead: La Muerte Nina Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune \n“Monumental Huaquechula Altar in honor of an Infant Soul” by Jose Antonio Cazabal Castro and Silverio Feliciano Reyes Sarmiento. \n“Monumental Huaquechula Altar in honor of an Infant Soul” by Jose Antonio Cazabal Castro and Silverio Feliciano Reyes Sarmiento. (Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune) \n\"Monumental Huaquechula Altar in honor of an Infant Soul,\" Jose Antonio Cazabal Castro and Silverio Feliciano Reyes Sarmiento, altar: \"This monumental 'ofrenda' (offering) is something that you would create for somebody who recently passed away. So the first Day of the Dead without somebody in your family or one of your friends, this is what would be created for them in this town, Huaquechula. It would go in your home and people around the town would know that you'd lost somebody, and they go and they visit these homes, and they bring candles as offerings to the family. The family then sets out food. And it turns into this celebration. The whole community comes together and remembers this person. In many other towns, people might not recognize this (artwork) as a Day of the Dead ofrenda because of the unique usage of the material, the satin. It has a lot of iconography that looks very, very Catholic, as opposed to in the south and central Mexico, where the ofrendas look very indigenous. They're decorated with lots of flowers. Even the censers have an indigenous look to them. This looks like a wedding cake. Somebody else has mentioned that it reminds them of a funeral parlor to some extent, the inside of a coffin. But it is certainly a huge undertaking by each family who puts one of these up. This ofrenda was done for the brother of the young man who came up to construct it. In the home, they stay up probably three to four days, and then they're completely gone.\" Day of the Dead: La Muerte Nina Brian Nguyen / Chicago Tribune \n\"Skeletons of Quinn 2015” by Hugo Crosthwaite assisted by Theresa Magario seen in the National Museum of Mexican Art's Day of the Dead exhibit. \n\"Skeletons of Quinn 2015” by Hugo Crosthwaite assisted by Theresa Magario seen in the National Museum of Mexican Art's Day of the Dead exhibit. (Brian Nguyen / Chicago Tribune) \n\"Skeletons of Quinn 2015,\" Hugo Crosthwaite, wall mural: \"This is a painting homage to Anthony Quinn. He was an actor, actually of Mexican descent. He would have been 100 years old this year so it's sort of bringing him back to celebrate an anniversary year. He was Mexican, but he played a Greek so well that even the National Hellenic Museum (in Chicago) has an exhibit up of his paintings. But he was not Greek. Crosthwaite is a Mexican artist who works quite a bit in the Los Angeles-San Diego area. What he does in his typical fashion is he works with these pencil drawings, and then he will go and do site-specific installations where he will place them onto the wall, and then he just takes out his cellphone and a brush and paints. And he just starts in one corner and works his way down. It is amazing to see him work. He doesn't project anything; he just works from his cellphone. He did another piece that was in 'The House on Mango Street' exhibition the same way. He came here a day early. He walked around the neighborhood, photographed a lot of the buildings in Pilsen, and then came back and incorporated them into his piece. He is probably the artist that I've most seen use cellphone technology and old-school, just talent, and bring the two things together. He takes images from the universe in his hand and then collages them onto the wall using his brush.\" Day of the Dead: La Muerte Nina Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune \nCesareo Moreno, chief curator of the National Museum of Mexican Art, with “We are Earth and Earth with Fire makes Stone: Ayotzinapa lives, the struggle continues!!” by Alfonso “Piloto” Nieves. \nCesareo Moreno, chief curator of the National Museum of Mexican Art, with “We are Earth and Earth with Fire makes Stone: Ayotzinapa lives, the struggle continues!!” by Alfonso “Piloto” Nieves. (Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune) \n\"We are Earth and Earth with Fire makes Stone: Ayotzinapa lives, the struggle continues!!\", Alfonso \"Piloto\" Nieves, multimedia installation: \"This installation is dedicated to the 43 missing students in Guerrero. It's a huge, huge subject for so many Mexican artists this past year. They just passed the one-year anniversary of when these 43 teaching students were basically arrested by Mexican government officials in a small town, in Guerrero, and then they disappeared. It's important, though, to know that this is not an ofrenda to 43 people who have died. They are missing. In Mexico it's very clear. Everyone says they are 'missing.' They don't say they're dead. The families want them back. They are ceramic skulls that hearken back again to indigenous iconography. Inside the forehead is a mirror. Whether you want to think of it as a mirror to the soul or a mirror meaning it could be us. ... The artist, everyone knows him as Piloto, 'pilot'; I can't even remember what his actual name is. And all his work is very political. He actually asked if he could do this piece. Their being kidnapped has galvanized so much social protest in Mexico. Much like 9/11 here in the States, 'The 43' has become something that has a much different meaning. 'Los Cuarenta Y Tres.' \" Day of the Dead: La Muerte Nina Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune \nOn the threshold of silence/En el umbral del silencio by Rocio Caballero in the National Museum of Mexican Art. \n\nOn the threshold of silence/En el umbral del silencio by Rocio Caballero in the National Museum of Mexican Art. \n(Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune) \n\"On the threshold of silence,\" Rocio Caballero, painting in the \"muerte nina\" tradition: \"This one is the main image that was used for the exhibition. Caballero is a phenomenal painter, obviously, very realistic. And in this piece she uses a lot of imagery that people would recognize. With the kinds of flowers she incorporates in there, they are associated with the child. White is one of the main colors because it identifies them as being pure, as being innocent, as being angels. When they die that young, they haven't done a lot of sinning, I guess we could say. That's why they call them little angels, 'angelitos.' They are innocent and they go straight to heaven, is the belief. And here we have, whether it's a sunset or a moon, it's definitely a reference to the heavens, the next life. And it's a very contemporary painting. It's not like the ones that would have been done in colonial Mexico, but at the same time, it's the idea of a sleeping child or a dead child. And then a lot of the little paper boats, the little cutouts, those are her own iconography that she uses in a lot of her images.\" Day of the Dead: La Muerte Nina Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune \n\"Unity/Unidad\" by Eduardo Alovarado in the National Museum of Mexican Art's Day of the Dead exhibit. \n\"Unity/Unidad\" by Eduardo Alovarado in the National Museum of Mexican Art's Day of the Dead exhibit. (Brian Nguyen/Chicago Tribune) \n\"Unity,\" Eduardo Alvarado, installation: \"This is a huge departure from the traditional ofrenda somebody would do in their home. Eddie Alvarado has created a contemporary art installation, and what I love about this is that it represents his education on the streets of Chicago as he went from the Pilsen neighborhood on the train every day and would go to a high school over near the Gold Coast in the downtown area, what he would see from the train. What he talks about here, it's an ofrenda to friends of his who have died on the streets and those people who have died on the streets who have not been remembered. So it is really a little slice of life from the neighborhood. But the central image of it is an image of Christ that is very common, very familiar in Mexican homes. Eddie has redone that image in a very contemporary way. It has kind of a lowrider feel to it with the airbrush, and then with the graffiti and the glitter. And all the names, these are people that have died. Oftentimes he does them in the (graffiti) style that they used to use. Very urban. It's an installation but again a way of paying tribute to people who have passed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:49:37.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
