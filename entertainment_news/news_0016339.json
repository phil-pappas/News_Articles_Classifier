The role wasn't too far away from a younger version of me,\" Example, whose real name is Elliot Gleave, said at the film's premiere on Monday night.\nThe rapper plays a successful city trader in the movie.\nAsked if he would now turn his back on music to focus on movie making, the rapper said earlier in an interview: \"No, not at all ... I've got two films coming out in (January) and March.\"\n\"I'm not taking on big roles yet ... I want to do interesting characters and because my schedule in music is still quite busy. I've already got 80 gigs booked next year, another album coming out ... music is still my thing.\"\n\"Between Two Worlds\" is released in the UK on Friday.\n(Reporting By Jane Witherspoon and Helena Williams; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian ; Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:19:48.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
