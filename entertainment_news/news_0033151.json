Using a mix of live music and DJ-ing, we travel through time from the hiphoppers of late '80s New York to the early '90s gangsters of LA - all the way to the total globalisation of hiphop. This loud, crazy show — a hiphop history tour and a playful exploration of the rules of cultural appropriation —will have you laughing and gasping in equal measure. Whether you know your Ghostface Killas from your Ice Cubes or if you’ve never heard anyone rhyme to a beat in your life, you’re guaranteed a good time. Join us this Christmas and be a part of hiphop history. Not for the easily offended.\nPitchfork reached out to the creators , Simon Maeder and Adam El Hagar, for comment. Quote: : \"Whilst we have ensured the Beastie Boys are fully appraised of our plans for the show, this is an unauthorised production based on the Beastie Boys story.\"\nBut will it be better than Mamma Mia! ?
