Romero and Hocus Pocus screenwriter Mick Garris are among founding board members of the center. \nThe Lord of the Rings star says, \"I would love to have a home for which we could constantly come year-round and celebrate with other fans from around the world. There's really no better place for there to be a permanent home for the celebration of horror as an art form than the Stanley Hotel. It was practically built for it.\" \nThe group hopes to receive $11.5 million in funding from the Colorado tourism board for the $24 million project.
