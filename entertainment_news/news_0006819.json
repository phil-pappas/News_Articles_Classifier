Channel 7 Local Real Estate Subscribe Now \nFORMER X FACTOR singer Jimmy Davis has taken to local radio on the Sunshine Coast to respond to criticism from Guy Sebastian. \nDavis and Sebastian became embroiled in a war of words on Twitter after Davis called The X Factor a \"game show\" in an interview with AAP and Sebastian branded him ungrateful for the exposure he received. \n\"I have a lot of respect for that guy,\" Davis told Mix FM's Mark and Caroline. \n\"I think he's a really talented musician. He's one of the nicest guys I've ever met. \n\"Obviously when I read those tweets I went 'Oh my god I've really done a number on him'. \n\"I don't think what I said deserved as much anger (from Guy). He's been in the business longer than any of us have. He should know certain words can be put in a bad light that makes it look a lot worse than it really was.\" \nAt the end of Tuesday's live eviction show Davis said: \"If you're coming into this thing and you're an independent artist, just try your best to stay who you are.\" \nDavis also used his chat with Mark and Caroline to set the record straight on why he didn't thank the judges or his mentor Chris Isaak during his final moments on the show. \n\"At the time you're put on the spot and you have five seconds to go 'what really means something to me right now?' I did get to thank all the judges, I just didn't get to do it on camera,\" he said. \nThe interview follows a lengthy Facebook post by Davis clarifying his comments to media on Wednesday. \nIn a series of tweets posted last night Sebastian said in he holds no grudge against Davis but also quipped that \"most of you wouldn't even know who he is without it (the show)\".
