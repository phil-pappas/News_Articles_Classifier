Photo Adam Hourigan / The Daily Examiner Adam Hourigan Subscribe Now \nFRONTMAN of the band that bears his name, Adam Eckersley, takes his touring very seriously. \nTo prove the point, since releasing their Second Album (its official title), at the Gympie Muster at the end of August, the boys have been on the road to \"Rockhampton, Townsville, Ipswich, Sydney, Canberra, Newcastle, Melbourne, Bellingen, Rooty Hill, Deniliquin...\" Adam rattles off the venues with machine gun precision. \nAnd when they say on the road, they mean the old school bitumen variety, not tarmacs. \n\"We did 4425km in 10 days for seven shows,\" Adam said. \nThat marathon effort continues this weekend with a show in his old hometown of Grafton, and his old stomping ground at the Clocktower Hotel (or Parkview Hotel as it was called before a fire ended that era). \nAdam said the band takes that kind of old-fashioned, hands-on touring approach because punters don't see a lot of that these days, especially with larger outfits like their rocking country five-piece. \n\"There aren't many bands touring like that anymore. We lug our own PA and start setting up about midday. It's really satisfying after a big long drive doing that and then have people turn up to see you. It's a bit like looking at the lawn after you've mowed it, the beer tastes better when you've done the job yourself.\" \nNext year the band has an even bigger road trip in their sights, the Nullarbor. \"We going to be driving to Western Australia, and do Melbourne, Adelaide, Port Augusta along the way.\" \nIn the meantime it's flat out until Christmas for the group as they continue to showcase their Second Album wares before wrapping up another big year of shows. \nOf course, being a former resident of the Clarence, and being married to one, means hometown gigs always offer that little bit of special and this weekend's bill is shaping up to be one of those. \nThat specialness comes courtesy of Adam's guest performer for this Saturday night's show, his wife and McClymont sister Brooke, who decided to tag along for the ride back home. \n\"It's becoming a bit of a thing when I play up there, Brooke saying she might come up and see 'Porkchop' (dad Peter) and all the family. We both have friends that still live there so I figured if she's going to be up there too I might as well put her to work,\" he laughs. \nBut it makes a lot of sense given the couple sing a track together on the band's latest album - Neil Young's Comes A Time - and Brooke also lends her (backing) vocals to a few other songs on the album \"because she was there\". \n'There' is home on the Central Coast where Adam recorded the vocal component of the album. The rest was done by none other than legendary producer Nick DiDia (Rage Against the Machine, Powderfinger) from 301 Studios in Byron Bay. \n\"He could tell I preferred singing in my shed, so he set up his gear there. It feels weird doing vocals for a studio album anytime but I was much more comfortable doing that at home. It's pretty relaxed way to work, walk down to the shed, back to house, have a beer, and back to the shed to do another song.\" \nOf course that also meant Brooke was close by and if the moment called for another voice it was just a matter of giving her holler. \n\"I didn't have too much of a plan when I started. We'd just go nuts and sing stuff together. Sometimes I'd be doing vocals and she would be in the kitchen and I'd just get her to come down to the shed to sing. It's hard to resist such a beautiful voice when it's only a few metres away. We both had a blast.\" \nAdam said the touring would wind up for a little bit over the new year and Christmas but he will be back at it again early next year in Tamworth for the country music festival, but not before some R&R in the Clarence. \n\"We are planning to come back up over the holidays to Jackadgery to see friends and spend bit of time there over the break, see Grandma and that sort of thing. It's always good to get back there, whether for work or play.\" adam eckersley band", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:15:15.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
