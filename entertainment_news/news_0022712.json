The song, Sruthi says, helped break the stereotype she was stuck with in Sandalwood.\n\"The kind of roles I was getting in Kannada cinema were mostly the girl-next door, halli hudugi type and never the glam doll. And while I was comfortable in that space, I needed to break out of it. When choreographer Imran Sardhariya first spoke to me about doing a special song for Plus, I wasn't interested. But considering that I have worked with him before and know that his style will not be vulgar, and the fact that it made me a part of another Anant Nag project, I said OK,\" she says.\nThe song, Sunday Banthu, she adds, is a celebratory track that does not have derogatory lyrics. In fact, they took special care to ensure that it does not look like just another item song, especially in terms of the dance styles — cabaret and belly dance — costumes, makeup and backdrop, including LED lights. \"I play myself, a celebrity dancing on a reality show. I get a scene as well, so, in a way, it is a cameo. The response to the song has been good. I haven't had people asking me why I've done this song, but then I have no qualms about it,\" she signs off.
