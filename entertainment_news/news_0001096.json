He faces charges of vandalism, unauthorized entry into a dwelling and failure to appear for a court appearance in California.\nEarlier in the week, Quaid told the judge he had not been informed ahead of time of the 2010 court proceeding, which he said occurred while he was in Vancouver on a previously scheduled trip.\nAfter leaving the court on Thursday, Quaid told reporters he planned to remain in Vermont and was interested in joining a local volunteer fire department, the Burlington Free Press reported.\nQuaid is known for movies such as \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"The Last Detail,\" for which he received an Oscar nomination, as well as the blockbuster \"Independence Day\" and the \"Vacation\" series of comedies. He is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid.\n(Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Will Dunham)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-16T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:59:40.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
