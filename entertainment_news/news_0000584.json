Prosecutors say Najee Smith and co-defendant Flamur Kastrataj were arraigned on the charge late Tuesday. Authorities say they refused to leave Catch, a restaurant on Ninth Avenue and 13th Street in the city's Meatpacking district, after being escorted to the exit early Tuesday. According to the criminal complaint, the two pushed another patron during the confrontation. Police say Smith became combative when he was asked to leave. Prosecutors say the defendants received pro bono legal services. Their attorneys couldn't immediately be located for comment. A call to LL Cool J's representative and an email message to his agent seeking comment weren't immediately returned Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:12:33.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
