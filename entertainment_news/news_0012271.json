It will allow people to see what I am capable of as an actor,” he said.\nThe actor-model likes it that the story is “very nice, very unique and well-written.”\nFabio, who is in a relationship with beauty queen-actress Bianca Manalo, doesn’t consider his character gay though.\n“The way the story would unfold, my character won’t be aware that he’s dating a guy. All along he thinks he is a girl so, it’s not a gay role,” he said.\nHow is it working with Ken? According to Fabio, it has been “amazing.”\n“Ken is such a mabait person and super magaling siya umarte. He’s very easy to work with. He also wants everyone around him to do good also,” he said, noting how Ken would often go out of his way to help him deliver his Tagalog lines.\n“So it’s just really nice that I was given this opportunity to work with him because he’s just really that good,” he added.\nThe 31-year-old is happy with how his career is going at the moment.\n“I think everything is just so perfect.. with my daughter Danielle (with former girlfriend Denisse Oca) and Bianca… It’s too good to be true and I’m just really enjoying and trying to make the most out of it,” he said.\n“Destiny Rose” also stars Katrina Halili, Manilyn Reynes, Jackie Lou Blanco, Irma Adlawan, Joko Diaz, Sheena Halili, Jeric Gonzales and JC Tiuseco. The show airs weekdays on GMA Afternoon Prime.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:38:32.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
