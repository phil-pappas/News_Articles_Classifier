We are here to enact our parts and if it requires a love-making scene, we've gone out and done that as any other scene that one would've approached,\" Sharman said at the trailer launch of film in Mumbai on Friday.\n\"I'm glad there is such hue and cry about love-making scenes in India because that ensures a good opening for the film. But apart from that, in my mind it's no big deal,\" he added.\n'Veer' actress Zareen reiterated Sharman's views and said, \"We shot the song towards the end of the film, and by then we knew each other and were quite comfortable with each other. We're actors and this is part of our jobs. It's mechanical.\"\nSharman also clarified about reports that he was going naked for the film.\n\"I was speaking to a journalist and I had mentioned that if a film of certain aesthetics comes my way and if I feel it requires to be done, then I would go to the extent of going butt-naked. And the highlight of it was made that, 'Sharman was going butt-naked'. But even that suited me as people might have read the article effectively,\" he said.\n'Hate Story 3', which is slated to release on December 4, also features Karan Singh Grover and Daisy Shah.\n\nWatch the motion poster of 'Hate Story 3' \n\nAlso read:  Zareen Khan smooches with a swollen mouth!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:02:55.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
