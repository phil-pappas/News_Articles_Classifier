I'm not sure the show has ever done an episode with so few scenes set at the hospital aside from season eight's plane crash episodes, which makes an episode almost entirely focused on a dinner party seem like a bit of a storytelling risk. But Grey's has never been afraid to take risks — semi-annual reminder that one time all the doctors literally sang \"How to Save a Life\" during a surgery — and has always been at its best when it's focused not on complicated surgeries, but on complicated emotions. Why not make the show's 250th episode reflect that? (Sidebar: HOLY HELL, 250 EPISODES.)\n The episode picks right back up where last week's cliffhanger ended: with Meredith opening her front door to see Callie's new girlfriend, Penny, and realize that she's the doctor who killed Derek. The fairness of the term \"killed\" is debated a little toward the end of the episode (by people like Jackson and April, who have a bit more emotional detachment from Derek himself). Penny didn't pick up a scalpel and stab Derek in the chest, but she did fail to order the CT that could've gotten his brain bleed fixed in time. She's responsible for that, but it's not murder — although, ironically, the How to Get Away With Murder crawl screen popped up just as Meredith told all the guests gathered for dinner who Penny really was. Tip of the hat if that was intentional.\nMore From Cosmopolitan Recounting the events of the episode is easy: All the doctors (plus Penny) gather for a dinner party. Everyone finds out about Penny's role in Derek's death. Emotional chaos ensues. Everyone goes home. But it's more difficult to describe why it all works as well as it does. It's partially due to the fact that this is the first time we've seen these doctors as a whole group encounter their grief over Derek together — sure, we got truncated scenes in the three-part Derek deathtravaganza, but nothing as sustained as this. Watching all the doctors try to make sense of what Penny's saying is fascinating, both because every reaction is so individual and nuanced, and because it's a weird, meta moment reminder of how long all these performers worked with Patrick Dempsey, and how odd his departure must have felt.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC And so there are plenty of heartbreaking moments. There's Callie, trying to protect her new girlfriend. There's Meredith and Amelia, screaming at each other because Amelia has space to break down and Meredith has three (invisible) kids to raise. There's Alex, knowing something is wrong and trying every trick he can to get Meredith to convince her to tell him what's going on (and plying her with tequila after she finally does). There's April and Jackson, still estranged, but Jackson telling her at the end of the night that the dinner she made tasted like home. There's Owen, pulling Amelia into his arms and trying to make it all feel a little better. There's Penny, hopelessly outnumbered and trying so hard to be composed. And there were plenty more.\nOh, throughout this, intern Babyface is sitting at the table on an actual child's rocking horse.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC Meanwhile, Maggie heads back to the hospital because she has a UTI from all her hot sex with Douchebeard, and because she's afraid he gave her a bunch of STIs. It's odd that the storytelling here seems to throw a little shade Maggie's way for wanting to make sure she was safe and healthy after a sexual encounter — like she should've just trusted Douchebeard? Or something? It was an odd storyline, especially since it seemed like it was intended to provide a little lightheartedness to the episode, and disheartening, as it indicates I will have to learn Douchbeard's real name soon.\nThere's also a fascinating few moments between Stephanie and Jo, in the wake of Jo telling on Stephanie for \"lying\" about her sickle cell anemia last week. Jo apologizes, and it takes a few tries, but eventually, Stephanie accepts, though she's furious when Jo implies that Stephanie is more motivated to practice medicine because of her past. \"You need some deep, dark secret motivating me … you need an even playing field before you can even be good with me. Stop trying to make us even, because we're not even.\" It's a really interesting dynamic, and one I hope the show keeps exploring — it reminds me a little of the rivalry Izzy and Cristina had at times.\nThe second-biggest bombshell of the episode comes when Penny announces she's going to be transferring to Gray Sloan Memorial as a resident — the small hospital where she treated Derek has closed. There's talk of calling a board meeting and getting her fired, and Penny herself even offers to rematch. That offer seems like the easier way out for Penny, frankly, but Meredith doesn't accept. She says, \"I'll see you Monday. Don't be late\" — and it sounds ominous as fuck .\n​ ​Follow Lauren on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445572623-140765-0885.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x426/gallery-1445572623-140765-0885.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x653/gallery-1445572623-140765-0885.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445572250-140680-7608.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x320/gallery-1445572623-140765-0885.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445572623-140765-0885.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x512/gallery-1445572623-140765-0885.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x512/gallery-1445572250-140680-7608.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445572250-140680-7608.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x653/gallery-1445572250-140680-7608.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x426/gallery-1445572250-140680-7608.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x320/gallery-1445572250-140680-7608.jpg", "https://twitter.com/L_Hoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:15:25.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
