Courtesy: Sunrise/Channel Seven June 3rd 2015 4 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ \nWHEN Elle Macpherson launched her super supplement last year, it seemed a natural progression for a supermodel nicknamed “The Body.” \nBut now the 51-year-old has revealed her business venture was the direct result of a cancer scare. \nThe mother-of-two said she turned her life around after finding a lump on her breast on her 49th birthday. \n“I thought I had cancer. I was away shooting Britain and Ireland’s Next Top Model , so I couldn’t see my doctor and I was really panicking,” the Australian beauty told Mail Online. \n“It was four weeks before I got the biopsy results, so it was a long-drawn-out and stressful period of not knowing. \n“I was lucky — it was a fibroadenoma [a benign growth of fibrous tissue], but it was a really big warning. I did some soul searching and realised that maybe I was taking the wrong vitamins and minerals, not eating properly and was too stressed.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:06:51.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
