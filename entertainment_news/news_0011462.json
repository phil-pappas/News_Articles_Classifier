News that Harry has been approached by several industry professionals regarding acting opportunities for the One Direction star. \n“Harry is being offered acting stuff, but he hasn’t accepted anything yet. He is not openly looking for stuff ether but is open to offers.” \nThe source further notes that if Harry did pursue an acting career, Styles would want to make sure that it’s “the right role” for him and that the film would align with Styles’ long term career goals. \nEarlier this year, rumors of Harry Styles’ acting plans caused turmoil within the One Direction fandom after film executive and producer Harvey Weinstein called Harry a “movie star” and admitted to having had lunch with Styles on several occasions in order to discuss his acting prospects , Huffington Post UK reports. \nWhile Weinstein feels that there’s “no question” that Harry will enter the film industry as an actor, One Direction fans continued to grow more concerned about the future of 1D given Harry Styles’ various career opportunities aside from the Made in the A.M. group. \nIn addition, Styles’ friend and former *NSYNC singer, Lance Bass, alleged to The Sun , via The Mirror , in August that Styles is “going to live in Hollywood” following One Direction’s hiatus and that Harry is growing more serious about considering his career opportunities as an actor. \nWhile One Direction fans will have to wait and see if Harry Styles makes his silver screen debut as an actor during One Direction’s hiatus, Styles has also sparked rumors of wanting to embark on a solo music career despite losing fifth member Zayn Malik to a new record label earlier this year.
