I never had that interaction with him, so I can’t speak to it.”\n‘Jersey Boys’ set to kick off Thanksgiving Parade \nBefore the 89th America’s Thanksgiving Parade kicks off in Detroit this year, spectators will be treated to a live performance of the award-winning Broadway musical “Jersey Boys.” The production, which has won Tony, Grammy and Olivier awards, is the story of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons . “Jersey Boys” is in town at the Fisher Theatre Nov. 17-Dec. 6.

Instagram user Jedidiah Jenkins, a travel writer, posted a photo of White with a group of neighbors. His caption: “My mom helps put on a neighborhood potluck in front of my childhood home. Our little dead-end street is populated primarily with older and quiet people... My neighborhood has been doing this potluck for over a decade. At the bottom of our street, there is a large gated historic home shrouded in trees. We’ve never really spotted that neighbor. But we have from time to time heard guitar coming from the garage.” Turns out, that neighbor is the Third Man himself. Jenkins said White stopped by the gathering, introduced himself and apologized for having not done so sooner. No details on whether White brought a dish to pass.\nAlso ... \n■ Country and pop singer Billy Joe Royal died suddenly at his home in North Carolina Tuesday, the Tennessean reports.
