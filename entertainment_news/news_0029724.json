But we're getting there.\"He admitted that he can't quite believe what he's doing on Strictly, joking: \"I stood there and I had to stand in a certain way to make sure my silhouette was on the shower curtain and I was waiting for Karen to pull the shower curtain back and I thought, 'I've definitely never done this before'.\" © BBC / Ray Burmiston And Jeremy had a brilliant comeback to Craig Revel Horwood's comment that he looked like a stork that had been struck by lightning, joking: \"We decided that this stork is about to deliver.\"In fact, he revealed that his waltz to Elvis Costello's 'She' will be a bit more serious than previous dances.\"I'm so tempted to look at Karen and she's going, 'Don't look at me, don't you look at me', so I'm learning to dance but not looking at the person - that's very strange,\" he said. \"But it's a joyful thing to be in a tender, real dance. This is less madcap.\"Strictly Come Dancing continues tomorrow (October 24) at 6.35pm on BBC One.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:22:47.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
