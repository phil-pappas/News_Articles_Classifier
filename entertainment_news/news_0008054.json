Fleming observed that 'seduction has, to a marked extent, replaced courtship',\" he said. \n\"This was only one of the many prescient ideas Fleming voiced, and seduction -- along with style, sophistication, and excitement -- will always be a part of the Bond franchise.\" \nCraig has been credited with improving the brand's image by exploring the complexities of Fleming's character. \nView gallery Ian Fleming, a British journalist, secret service agent and writer, whose most famous creation was &&nbsp;… \"There's no doubt that the nature of the Bond films has changed with Daniel Craig,\" said James Chapman, professor of film studies at the University of Leicester and author of \"Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films.\"\n\"The Bond they have today is more contemporary, and slightly more rough-edged.\"\nFleming had described Bond as a \"believable man,\" Watt said.\n\"I think he might have meant emotionally vulnerable.\"\n\"'Skyfall' hints at this by returning Bond to his childhood home, an old caretaker, and a simple rural church and by his reaction to M's death,\" he said of the character who plays Bond's boss. \n\"No matter how escapist the action gets, these human dimensions of affection and emotional fragility remain.\nView gallery Scottish actor Sean Connery, pictured in 1982 in Nice, during the making of 'Never say, never ag … \"The franchise fails when Bond evokes comparison with mere action heroes,\" he added.\n\n- Fleming 'uncannily prescient' -\n\nIn the new film, which will receive its star-studded Royal Premiere in London, Bond will once again do battle with global criminal agency SPECTRE, which made its first appearance in 1971 classic \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\nAlthough a homage to the traditional super-enemy of Bond's past, the SPECTRE group plays on very modern fears, helping the franchise remain relevant, said Watt.\n\"Fleming was uncannily prescient about... a world where bad actors typically don't represent states, but multinational terrorist networks like SPECTRE,\" he said.\n\"Bond thus gets to have both an old-fashioned 'showdown' with the evil gunslinger at high noon and continue after the fight because the network and its cells extend well beyond a villain or a nation.\"\nSneak previews of the new film hint at a treat for devotees and nostalgists, with references to iconic moments from previous films set to further strengthen the Bond myth.\nDespite its current success, Craig's recent comment that he would rather \"slit my wrists\" than sign up for the role again suggests a cloud on the horizon.\nThe possible identity of his successor has already caused controversy, with Anthony Horowitz -- author of the latest Bond novel -- saying that \"The Wire\" actor Idris Elba was \"too street\" to play 007, sparking accusations of racism.\nBut Chapman dismissed speculation about a black or female Bond as \"a media storm in a teacup\" and refused to rule out another outing for Craig.\n\"One assumes this is simply round one in the negotiations around his fee for Bond 25!\" he joked.\nBonds Commodity Markets James Bond Ian Fleming Daniel Craig", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:05:41.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
