Therefore US politicians and corporate power are driving profits as usual at the expense of humanity and where apparently they just do not care about the human side of things, for wealth, power and greed is all that these people ultimately comprehend. That is why the world is in the terrible dire state that it is, as the mentality is that of an insane human and nothing else.\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership: A Threat to Affordable Medicines for Millions (Médecins Sans Frontières, the humanitarian group of international doctors, nurses and clinicians)\nhttp://www.msfaccess.org/spotlight-on/trans-pacific-partnership-agreement\nHumanity is Entering the Final Stage of 'its' Development Existence, as Corporate Power and Greed, Consolidated Globalisation and the Politico-Wealthy Corporate Agenda Engages with the World's Largest Ever by Far Global Trade Agreements that will undermine the World order, not Sustain it - http://worldinnovationfoundation.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/humanity-is-entering-final-stage-of-its.html\nBut also this week, the hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières in the Afghan city of Kunduz was bombed, killing nine MSF staff members together with twenty two patients, and what can be seen as an indicator that the US have other ideals. The reason is that they bombed the hospital for about 1-hour even though the humanitarian Médecins Sans Frontières organization that cares and medically helps all humans, contacted the US to ask them to stop straight after the first hit. They did not and continued.\nIndeed, there seems to be emerging, a sense that the US, through its vested corporate-interest and vast weapons industry (largest producer and creator of killing arms in the world by far), has created wars, not stopped them. In this respect questions are being asked, is ISIS a joint American generated situation to sell US armaments.\nQ. I wonder if Snowden or Assange knows?\nA. Probably, but no-one will believe them where western controlled media is concerned by the censorship of the richest 1%..\nIs the 'Islamic State' a CIA-Mossad Creation? - http://worldinnovationfoundation.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/is-islamic-state-cia-mossad-creation.html\nTime will tell, but it is going to take millions of lives, human misery and unprecedented intercontinental displacements (more than even WW1 & WW2 combined) to find out.
