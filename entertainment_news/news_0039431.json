Check out what holiday romances, and other romances, Happy Ever After's contributors recommended this week:\nA Daddy for Christmas by Linda Ford. This one is strong on scripture and prayer. I would have loved to have seen more danger woven into the story — from the winter elements, maybe, or Clare's father. The pacing was ideal, the historical aspects well-researched and charming. This addition to Linda Ford's Eden Valley series is a lovely, luminous tribute to families, healing and hope, and the enduring spirit of Christmas. (Recommended by Kathy Altman)\nA Bad Boy for Christmas by Jessica Lemmon. Shopping for a hot holiday read? Look no further than A Bad Boy for Christmas. Actually, it's a terrific read for any time of the year. With charismatic characters, stirring situations and enough sexy to fill an entire town's worth of stockings, this latest in Lemmon's Second Chance series is 400-plus pages of Christmas magic. (Recommended by Kathy Altman)\nA Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas by Kim Redford. The first book in Kim Redford's Smokin' Hot Cowboys series, and smokin' is right. With the 90-degree Texas weather, the brush-fire epidemic, and the very fine Trey Duval running around stamping out flames and rescuing kittens, it's a wonder this book didn't burn me to a crisp. With its vividly written firefighting scenes, rich cast of characters and folksy charm, A Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas will keep you warm and toasty and entertained in a big — and I mean Texas big — way. (Recommended by Kathy Altman)\nCaptured by Terri Haynes. (Photo: Brown Girls Publishing)\nNON-CHRISTMAS RECS\nCaptured by Terri J. Haynes. First in the Love and Faith series. This debut is loaded with suspense along with the romance between two passionate and dedicated individuals — Will and Savannah. Knowing the reason behind their motivation endears them as two heroes, each in his and her way. Haynes does a great job of writing this determined couple who must fight a multitude of obstacles, including the unpleasantness of their former relationships, to achieve their goals. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nThe Seventh District by Stacy-Deanne. This one is dedicated to the author's grandmother, who died of breast cancer. The heroine, a breast cancer survivor, must rise from the aftermath of the treatment and the physical and emotional changes that she's endured. She is the anchor in the story about betrayal and family secrets. As she struggles with her new self, she must also face what or who she wants in her life. Stacy-Deanne writes an emotional tribute to courage and sacrifices. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nThe Balm of Love by Nikki Walker. The dramatic saga of these friends and family around the Serenity Inn series continues. This time, Eleanor and Terry are face-to-face in an expected situation that provides the perfect opportunity for reflection on the verge of their divorce. Nikki Walker turns the spotlight on each couple as they continue to face trials that test their faith and commitment. Faith and persistence carry them through the darkness, and vulnerabilities are laid bare for judgment but also for forgiveness. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nVelvet Undercover by Teri Brown. I haven't read many historical YAs and love these genre crossovers. Samantha is a really great heroine who is smart and the perfect spy. Teri Brown is also a fantastic storyteller, and Velvet Undercover will sweep you away. The mystery of who Velvet is kept me guessing, and come on, who doesn't love an elite all-woman spy group? (Recommended by Jessie Potts)\nIlluminae by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff. This book isn't for everyone, or rather the writing style won't be. It's very different from anything I've read, and I have to say I enjoyed the e-mails, AI, transcripts and different forms of communications. It almost made the book feel more alive, more time sensitive and exciting. You have to be in the mood for this space opera because there were awesome pictures, diagrams and there's a lot going on! It's a new type of read and one I'm so glad I experienced.
