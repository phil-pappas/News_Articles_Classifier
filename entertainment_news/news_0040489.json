You need to be more exaggerated in the movement of the dance. You just come out and make me smile.” \nCarol had previously told HuffPost that she thought she’d be the first celeb to be voted off the dance show. \n“Oh, I’ve resigned myself to that already. Because really I am a carthorse,” she said. \n“You know how there’s usually a comedy figure? Well… \n“And the other thing is, I have a real problem with my right and my left. So they can be telling me ‘left foot’ all they want - I still don’t know which one it is.” Close", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:12:17.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
