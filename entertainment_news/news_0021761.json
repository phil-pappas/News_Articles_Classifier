(old city recycling center) Cost: Free CONNECT TWEET   \nTo some, riding down the road with nothing but a helmet and some leather between you and the world sounds terrifying. To a motorcycle rider, though, it’s the most freeing experience on Earth. \nAlthough women are often thought of as motorcycle passengers or “back seat riders,” they are now are finding independence in owning and riding their own bikes. As the fastest growing market in the motorcycle industry, the ladies are taking this traditionally male pastime and making it their own. \nIn order to encourage more women to ride, a group of ladies created the Tenacious Dames, a statewide women’s riding club with chapters in Billings, Miles City, Helena, Bozeman and Great Falls. \nThe club has a range of women riders, from those who have never ridden before to ladies with many years of riding under their belts. Their motto, “Women empowering women though the passion of motorcycling riding,” demonstrates how these riders are more than just a club; they promote kinship and female empowerment, as well. \nIn endorsement of its message, the Tenacious Dames plan their first Bikers’ Swap Meet on Saturday, Oct. 24, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The event takes place at the old city recycling center, 1100 15th St. N., and anyone looking to buy or sell bike parts, leathers, boots, helmets, clothing, memorabilia and more should check it out. \nThere will also be people offering bike-related services such as leather repair, bike maintenance, painting and LED lighting. \nThe swap meet is open to all makes and models and is not limited to female shoppers, and the Tenacious Dames have even invited the YWCA and the Rock’N Rollerz junior roller derby team to join them to help support those groups’ fundraising efforts. \nThe YWCA provides coffee and doughnuts in the morning and pulled pork sandwiches with all the fixings and Pepsi for the afternoon while the roller derby kids sell candy bars to raise money for their team. \nAdmission to the swap meet is free to the public. Call Julie at 861-4712 or Tina Bundtrock, 590-5614 for more information or to become a vendor. \nIf you are a rider or would like to learn how to ride, the Tenacious Dames can provide support and help you learn the ropes. Find it on Facebook at Tenacious Dames RC or The Great Falls Chapter of the Tenacious Dames and keep an eye out for chapters popping up in Butte and the Kalispell/Big Fork area in the spring.
