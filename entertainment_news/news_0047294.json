If there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, I go to someone's management, I get their number and I text them. It's an important lesson for anyone to learn in 2015.\"\nTaylor was happier to talk about her friendship with Kanye, who famously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV VMAs. \"Me and Kanye are on such good terms now, six years later,\" said Taylor. \"It took a while ... But I had to tell Beck this story earlier.\nMore From Cosmopolitan \"I was at dinner with Kanye a week after the Grammys, he stops what he's saying and he goes, 'What is this song? I need to listen to this every day.' I said, 'It's Beck, it's on an album called Morning Phase , I think you've heard of it…' We just burst out laughing. And he says, 'Hey, sometimes I'm wrong.'\"\nKanye had of course protested Beck winning the Grammy Award for Best Album for Morning Phase , initially joke-rushing the stage and later saying that the singer-songwriter should have \"respected artistry\" and given his prize to Beyoncé .\nThe rapper later gave Beck a public apology .\nBeck had taken Kanye's interruption in good humour at the time, saying, \"You can't please everybody, man. I still love him and think he's genius. I aspire to do what he does.\"\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Asked if the thought of topping her 1989 album scares her,Taylor said: \"N . How could the next one be as big? Maybe the next album will be a bridge to somewhere else. Or maybe I'll just go ahead and change everything.\"\nShe added of her plans after her world tour ends in December: \"I think I should take some time off. I think people might need a break from me.\n\"I'm going to ... I don't know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\"", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x626/1444273272-syn-cos-taylor-swift-nme-cover.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444273272-syn-cos-taylor-swift-nme-cover.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444273270-syn-cos-taylor-swift-nme-1.jpg", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a627550/kanye-west-rushes-on-stage-during-becks-grammy-awards-acceptance-speech.htm", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a627939/kanye-west-says-he-loves-beck-but-he-didnt-deserve-grammy-award.html", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x674/1444273270-syn-cos-taylor-swift-nme-1.jpg", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a605386/taylor-swift-1989-album-review-lighter-catchier-and-more-calculated.html", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a666119/what-bad-blood-nicki-minaj-and-taylor-swift-bury-that-feud-in-badass-mtv-vmas-duet.html", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a659530/taylor-swift-and-nicki-minaj-just-clashed-on-twitter-and-even-kim-kardashian-jumped-in.html", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a627560/kanye-west-beck-should-have-given-grammy-award-to-real-artist-beyonce.html", "http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a631852/kanye-west-apologises-to-beck-for-grammys-stage-invasion.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:29:28.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
