A few years before that, there was Run DMC, Madonna and R.E.M.\nThis year's list of newly eligible acts included Smashing Pumpkins, Mariah Carey and Blur, among others. All are great artists in their own right. But none of them scream first ballot Hall of Famer.\nStill, Smashing Pumpkins and Mariah Carey impact may have actually been felt on this year's ballot, as certain questions likely came up like:\nHow can you nominate Mariah Carey when Janet Jackson hasn't been nominated? Can Smashing Pumpkins really get inducted before Deep Purple or Cheap Trick? Would there even be a Blur without The Smiths?\nIn Mariah Carey's case, it forces the nominating committee to take a look at other pop/R&B divas, which likely helped Jackson and Chaka Khan earn nominations this year and could bode well for someone like Whitney Houston.\nSmashing Pumpkins are up against a backlog of influential late 1980s/early 1990s rock acts that's only getting more crowded. Sonic Youth and Soundgarden are widely considered two major snubs, while Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, and Radiohead will all be eligible in the next few years.\nThat probably led the nominating committee to focus on several 1970s bands -- The Cars, Chicago, Deep Purple, etc. -- that haven't been inducted yet.\nThe Smiths have been nominated two years in a row now. If there was any thought that Blur deserved a nomination it was surely squashed by the fact that The Smiths haven't had their day yet.\nThe same goes for A Tribe Called Quest. The 1990s hip-hop group's name is now floating out there with other names like LL Cool J, De La Soul and Eric B & Rakim. But rest assured N.W.A.'s possible induction in 2016 would open the door wider for all of them.\nOther acts eligible to be nominated for the first time in 2015 were Hole, Alice in Chains, Ice Cube and Kid Rock. Given the long list of snubs from the 1970s and 1980s, each of those acts will have to wait a longtime to receive a nomination (if ever).\nStill, their candidacy should shine a light on earlier influencers who have been overlooked.", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/10/janet_jackson_nine_inch_nails.html#incart_river", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aeETEoNfOg"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:38.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
