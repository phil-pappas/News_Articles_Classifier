Sitting on the grass to hear a panel of filmmakers talk about their craft is a typical Telluride moment. This year’s film festival, which took place Sept. 4-7, brought glamour down to earth, as it always does. Just as important as sunshine and a grassy park are the better-cushioned seats in eight movie venues, including even a converted school gymnasium and the local ice rink, refitted and darkened for non-stop movie watching. It’s here that festival goers can see Keaton on the screen in “Spotlight” and Streep’s latest performance in “Suffragette,” films due for release in cinemas later this year. Telluride constantly pulls movie lovers from one experience to another one. Keaton’s good humor and Streep’s charm were balanced by the somber reflections of director Laszlo Nemes, who came to Colorado with his gripping concentration camp drama “Son of Saul,” a movie that redefines how the Holocaust is treated in film. No one expected the vision of a previously unknown director to become one of the most talked-about experiences at the festival. “Unpredictable” is a watchword at Telluride, beginning with a carefully guarded program that is disclosed on the festival website only on opening day long after patrons have made non-refundable deposits on lodging and blocked out any other plans for Labor Day weekend. But Telluride is always worth the risk. Like Forest Gump’s box of chocolates, you may get a cream center or a nut that’s a bit hard to crack. The first step after arriving in Telluride is to study the program and prioritize choices. Navigating the festival on a budget means foregoing the pricey festival pass and lining up to purchase individual tickets for each film. Those of us without a plastic badge hanging around our necks wait optimistically at the back of the line, hoping that the pass holders who get to go in first will leave enough seats for the rest of us. There are inevitably some disappointments, but in the course of four days, it is almost always possible to see everything on one’s personal list. Besides, an advantage of spending time in line with other cinephiles is catching the buzz about the films. “What have you seen?” “What have you liked best so far?” “How was the interview with the actor after the screening?” Strategy is important and part of the fun. All the selections are shown multiple times, so it’s a good idea to try for later screenings of must-see films, after lots of pass holders have already been to them. If a film has a big star (like Keaton or Streep), it will likely be at the local cinema in the coming months, so unless you just can’t wait to see it, why not try for less familiar options instead? Some of the best times at Telluride are spent watching movies that will never be available anywhere else. Movies from every culture on the planet cross the screens there, and the festival also makes a point of showing rediscovered or newly restored films from the silent era. This year we were treated to a spectacular revival of “L’Inhumaine,” a French tour-de-force from 1924, accompanied by a live orchestra. This year that unpredictable pull from one place to another took us to the heights of Mount Everest. “Sherpa” is Jennifer Peedom’s unusual portrait of the native mountaineering guides who put their lives on the line to help others fulfill their bucket lists. Her film asks us whether checking Everest off a list is really worth the expense of another life. We descended from the vastness of the Himalayas to the confines of a sealed container: The prison in which a kidnapper and rapist kept a young woman and their son for seven years, until a daring escape allowed the boy to experience the outside world for the first time. “Room,” directed by Lenny Abrahamson, is based on Emma Donoghue’s novel and was another example of the parent-child theme we detected in several of this year’s selections. Actor Brie Larson as the imprisoned mother makes an otherwise dismal narrative so compelling that the movie quickly became the hands-down favorite of many of this year’s festival goers. The father-daughter narrative of “He Named Me Malala” is especially beautiful. This new documentary by filmmaker Davis Guggenheim features the 17-year old girl from Pakistan who won the Nobel Peace Prize and the proud father who named her. In a post-screening conversation with fellow documentarian Ken Burns, Guggenheim described the weeks he spent with Malala and her family in their new home in England. Skillfully assuaging our ongoing fear of terrorism with the strength-giving joys of domestic life, “He Named Me Malala” is a funny and optimistic film about a normal teenager who has become an inspiration. The quiet determination that helps her contend with the typical struggles of the teen years also allows her to speak her mind on the world stage. Telluride sits in a picturesque box canyon with a silver ribbon waterfall at one end. There is really only one way in, and leaving town means reluctantly turning your back on it and exiting by the same road. Somehow it’s appropriate that Telluride is not a place one can “pass through.” The impressions of the place and of the festival linger long after the movie screens go dark and the sun dips below the San Juan peaks. We spent the long drive back to Greeley replaying in our minds the films and conversations we found most enjoyable or most provocative, or both, and we’re already looking forward to opening next year’s box of chocolates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:32:36.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
