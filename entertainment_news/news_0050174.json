USA TODAY caught up with the rapper to find out what he's been listening to lately.\nSeptember , Earth, Wind & Fire\nIt's a song that no matter when it's played, everyone gets up and starts to party. It's always on my playlist.\nAll Night Long , Lionel Richie\nThis song reminds of being a little kid in the '80s and making me feel happy, no matter what was going on.\nHero , Mariah Carey\nThis song helped me get through a lot of struggles. To this day, it still motivates me to find that there's a hero inside me everyday.\nTo Be Real , Cheryl Lynn\nThis song's message is everything—especially in a society that's so connected. Listening to this song is a good way to disconnect and be real.\nThe Way You Make Me Feel , Michael Jackson\nIt's a jamming song. It's the first video where I saw Michael Jackson shouting out to a girl.\nEverybody Wants To Rule The World , Tears for Fears\nThe melody is classic 80's. And everyone wants to rule the world, says Mr. Worldwide.\nVivir Mi Vida , Marc Anthony\nThis song is what it’s all about. It’s living life and not letting life live you.\nLookout Weekend , Debbie Deb\nReminds me of being in roller-skate rinks ducking and dodging skaters to get to the dance floor in the middle of the rink to dance with the girls. Fun fact: I still don't know how to roller skate\nJuicy , The Notorious B.I.G.\nI relate to everything in this song. That's my motto: from negatives to positives.\nHere I Go Again , Whitesnake\nLove this record. I relate to the song because I'm a loner—and how could anyone ignore Tawny Kitaen in the video?\n16 CONNECT 50 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/1Rk0L0n TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rk0L0n&text=The%20songs%20on%20Pitbull%27s%20playlist%20may%20surprise%20you&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rk0L0n&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/55158b29252b141f4ed1698499db6b70bfd480bb/c=0-320-3840-5440&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792205338070655-Pitbull-Globalization-Image-PhotoCredit-Randall-Slavin.jpeg", "http://usat.ly/1Rk0L0n", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792205338070655-Pitbull-Globalization-Image-PhotoCredit-Randall-Slavin.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792205338070655-Pitbull-Globalization-Image-PhotoCredit-Randall-Slavin.jpeg"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:59:05.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
