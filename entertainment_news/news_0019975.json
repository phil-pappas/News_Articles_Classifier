For more than a century it reflected the city’s affluence and cultural diversity brought by the booming iron and steel industries. Rich, poor, black, white, Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, nonbelievers, the famous and the anonymous — all were present in graves with and without markers. \nIn case of severe weather, the event will be canceled. \nFor information, go to mahoninghistory.org.
