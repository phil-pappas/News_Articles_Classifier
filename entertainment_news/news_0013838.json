Visitors to Ellis Island can only see those buildings through a scheduled hard-hat tour , and aren't allowed to roam freely through the buildings. \nMore than 40 interactive photographs, created with detailed 3-D scans of buildings, both inside and out, and landscapes, were used to create the virtual trip. \nAs users click through the sweeping views, and wind through interiors of dilapidated hospital rooms, they can also click on historic facts and photographs, and detailed close-ups. \nFrom about 1892 until 1954, Ellis Island was the country's busiest immigration hub. The island's south side treated contagious diseases, along with more mild sicknesses and mental health problems. \nWhile most were allowed to officially immigrate into the U.S. after they recovered, some were forced to return to their home countries, the Park Service said. \nThe virtual tour was released to help bring more attention to the complex of buildings, that have been stabilized, but not restored. Much of the old interiors, and old furniture, have fallen into disrepair. \n“These buildings and spaces are of paramount historical importance,\" said John Hnedak, deputy superintendent of the Park Service. \"The stories they tell are an integral part of the Ellis Island saga — we are thrilled to be able to make this extraordinary virtual experience available to the public.” \nSave Ellis Island , the island's nonprofit partner is dedicated to the protection of the south buildings, and runs reservation-only tours of several of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:31:01.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
