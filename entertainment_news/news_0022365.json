Music Adele announces new album \nOh, it was so teasingly close. Knowing that Adele's new single, the first from her third album which is due next month, was called Hello , at least some were speculating – perversely hoping? – that it might be a cover of Lionel Ritchie's '80s tear-jerker of that name. Remember \"hello, is it me you're looking for?\" and the story video of the blind sculptor? Stop pretending, of course you do. \nAfter all, it's no secret that the young Adele Atkins grew up as much on '80s singers such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as the more fashionable older voices such as Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack and Etta James. It wouldn't be too far-fetched would it to think that 25 , following on from her multi-million selling debut 19 and its Grammy-winning sequel, 21 (the ages she was at each recording), would let her inner diva free? \nAnd when the new song, set in a story video of misconnecting lovers that might well have been done in an early MTV style, begins with her singing \"hello, it's me ...\", well, hearts flutter. Briefly. Advertisement \n\nHowever, while this is a new song there is definitely an '80s feel to it, even without boldly patterned jumpers and shoulder pads. Adele's voice is prominent early over bare piano and when the sound deepens with drum and bass her voice rises and broadens, and never leaves centre stage. \nThis is big singing, showy and unafraid to dominate, much like the young Houston who you could imagine singing this in her pomp, perhaps for a film starring Kevin Costner or a sad-eyed Debra Winger. There is very little Carey-esque melismatic business – that five notes for every syllable style that lives on in every talent show contestant – but plenty of drive and the power to pin a listener to the back wall. It will be the song to rule for the rest of the year, and probably into 2016. \nLyrically, while Adele has said that 25 will be less about breaking up and more about \"making up with myself, making up for lost time, making up for everything I ever did and never did\", Hello is still heavy with regret and failure even as she says \"at least I can say that I tried, to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart\", some years after a break up. \n\"I'm sorry for everything that I've done,\" she says repeatedly, having told us that she's not in London anymore but in \"California \"dreaming about who we used to be\", which may be rubbing it in. But it's not that mean as she finishes with the hope that \"leaving doesn't tear you apart any more\". \nSo, you know, she cares. And she didn't need a potter's wheel to show it. \n25 will be released on November 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:50:25.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
