Yet a surprising amount of rock music has come from Australia. At Oldies Night beginning at 7 p.m. Saturday BJ the DJ will look at a generous sampling of antipodean pop and rock music at Wesley Methodist Church, 816 S. Main St. Some of the Aussie rockers who hit it big in America include the Bee Gees, Men at Work, the Little River Band, Olivia Newton-John, Rick Springfield, Helen Reddy, Air Supply and AC/DC. Before any of them, however, there was Frank Ifield’s “I Remember You,” Rolf Harris’ “Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport,” “Friday on My Mind” by the Easybeats and “The Lord’s Prayer” by Sister Janet Mead. “But there’s a lot more Australian stuff you’ve probably never heard,” said DJ Bob Jones in a release. He will also play “I’ve Been Everywhere” by Lucky Starr, which started out down under, with Australian places in the lyrics. Normie Rowe did a version of “Qué Será, Será” which sounds nothing like Doris Day’s original. And “She’s a Mod” by Ray Columbus and the Invaders will make you think you’re in a time machine, Jones said. It’s the 114th installment of Oldies Night in Milton-Freewater. Admission is free.
