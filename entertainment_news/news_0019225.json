If you think the consistency ... essentially with consistency I hope to carve out my own name and people to start knowing that there are things that are definitively me and no one else. But I do take it as a huge compliment. I'll never be Prince to me.'' \nMiguel - who has just unveiled the Vanessa Hudgens-starring video for 'Waves', the latest single from his album 'Wildheart' - has earned sex symbol status due to his raunchy songs and videos. \nThe 29-year-old singer is happy to be a heartthrob to his fans as he believes sensuality is an important part of music. \nHe said: ''I guess I embody a few things man and that's part of my personality so I am not mad at it being a part of it. There is a lot more to be discovered I suppose.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:19:48.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
