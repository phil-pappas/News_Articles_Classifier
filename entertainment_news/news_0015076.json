Related Andrew Whitworth frustrated over... \nRonaldo Designer Jewelry was chosen to \"come on down\" and have some of its items as prizes on “The Price is Right.” \n\"We started 27 years ago on a kitchen table and from that, it's just (grown). It's the American dream at its best,” president Ronaldo Needham said. \n“The Price is Right” producers chose the company to have some its products on the show. \n\"We thought it was a joke at first and kind of made sure we verified everything, but it was true and we've been working on it close to a year, and this is the end game here. This is where we actually get to see it on the show,” executive vice president Michael Scheser said. \nThey didn't have to wait long on Tuesday. The jewelry was the first item up for bids. \n\"This Ronaldo Designer Jewelry package includes a matching 14-carat gold and sterling silver bracelet and earrings, each with sapphire and diamond accents,\" the announcer said in introducing the jewelry on the show. \n\"We all knew when the lady said $1,001. We were like ‘Yay! She's got it!’ So that was fun,” said Angela Williams, the company's chief design officer. \nThe retail price was more than $2,000. \nIt's about more than the TV time. The company is expanding and adding more than 80 jobs in Indiana. \n\"We're very excited for the local community, the amount of people we can hire, put more food on the table right here in Indiana and Kentucky,” Needham said. \nRonaldo Designer Jewelry will be on six episodes of the show. \n\"They're spread out one per month from now through next year,” Scheser said. \nThe company will also be featured in “The Price is Right” and “Let’s Make a Deal” traveling shows. \nA Louisville woman, April Mills, was a contestant on Tuesday's show. \nShe got onstage but did not make it to the Showcase Showdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:09:52.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
