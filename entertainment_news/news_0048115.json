Photo: Peter Stoop \n \nMalcolm Turnbull was comedian Lawrence Mooney's insurance policy. It paid out on September 14, 2015, the day Tony Abbott was ousted as prime minister. \n\"Tony Abbott, comically, is over for me. I could not get a laugh out of Tony Abbott ever again now, because people would be like,  OK mate, he's copped his fair whack, let him go.\n\"[Malcolm Turnbull] was the Liberal party's backup plan, and my backup  plan, and it has come to fruition.\"\nAdvertisement Mooney, perhaps best known as the host of ABC TV's  Dirty Laundry Live ,   had based a fair bit of his latest show on  the former prime minister. But \"you can't be angry in retrospect\", and after hearing whispers of a leadership spill earlier this year, Mooney perfected his impression of the wealthy and articulate Turnbull (\"He likes to say all the letters in all the words\") by studying his appearances on the ABC.\n\"It's my love of Malcolm that led me to try to impersonat him, because I love listening to him speak, and he loves listening to him speak as well. That's the thing about it, he's got such beautiful, round vowel sounds and he's one of those Australians that takes pride in speaking well and doesn't see it as ... some sort of challenge to his manhood, and I like that.\"\nWhile, as  Fairfax Media 's political cartoonist John Shakespeare has suggested, Turnbull might be less \"comically exciting\"  than Abbott, who's career as prime minister was an extended field day for comedians like John Oliver , Mooney says that, \"Malcolm's much more ripe for parody. Tony was ripe for just, mockery\".\nModern politicians are already caricatures of themselves, he says.  \"They have to be so careful with everything they say, they end up creating a kind of self-parody and they live in this world of heightened use of language and little soundbites.\n\"And of course, they're making decisions that concern us all and deserve to be satirised and mocked.\"\nThat, and his comedy credo – \"punch up, rather than punch down\" – is why leaders are fair game, he says.\nAfter moving to Melbourne, Mooney's parents – from Liverpool in England – raised him and his brothers on an comedy diet of  Dave Allen ,  Dad's Army  and  George and Mildred , and he offers this detail   to explain his sense of humour.\nMooney, who calls himself a \"frustrated politician\", says: \"If I was doing a Stanislavskian dissection of my own psyche, I would say one of my super objectives was to be prime minister of the country. But I neither have the brains nor the wherewithal to make that happen and probably I have too many skeletons in the closet that journalists could easily rattle.\"\nWhile Mooney was working on this latest show, a loved uncle died. He and his two older brothers flew to England to organise the funeral, while Mooney, who has just turned 50, wrestled with the idea of his own mortality. Death is, he admits, unlike politics, an unconventional basis for comedy, but not an impossible one.\n\"In a way comedy is life and death. It uses a lot of death analogies. You know, you either kill or you die. The audience kills themselves laughing, so they murdered a room.\n\"[ Surely Not! ] is all about life and death and the fact they we're all going to die and not all deaths are necessarily sad ones. This one was, for us, but I talk about how you don't have to 'fakely' grieve.\"\nMooney, who once trained as a drug detector dog handler in Canberra, has more plans for his time left on Earth. A pilot of a new sitcom titled Moon Man  will air on the ABC \"sometime\" next year.  He calls it a Louis CK-esque, Curb Your Enthusiasm , style of television \"in the tradition of comedians doing shows about themselves\".\nSurely Not!  won the Barry Award at this year's Melbourne International Comedy Festival and won Best Show at the Sydney Comedy Festival. Anyone who wants to learn to talk like Turnbull can catch the show in Canberra next month.\nLawrence Mooney performs Surely Not! at The Playhouse on October 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:19:27.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
