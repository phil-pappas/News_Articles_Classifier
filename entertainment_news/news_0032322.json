Even when it was 100 the other day, I loved it. It felt good. I worked on my album in Philly, and I would take the train to New York on the weekends, and I’d get off the train and immediately want to die. I would just hate my life. And I’m from Nashville, which is kind of similar — when it’s hot, it’s fucking miserable. But Nashville at least it kind of rains in the summer. I don’t even remember the last time it rained out here. I always wondered how those big-ass fires start in L.A., and then I’ll throw my cigarette out the window or something, and I’m like, ‘There it is.'” Miley offends the cat-loving community: “[C]ats — cats are fucking creepy. Oh my God, cats are creepy. Every time I see a cat, I think it’s gonna turn on me. It’s gonna turn for the worst. I don’t ever see loyalty in cats. They’re gonna scratch you, and then run away.”\nShe has profound thoughts on the media and Trayvon Martin : “And what makes me kind of sick is, Trayvon Martin’s trial didn’t happen more than two months ago. It got talked about a lot — but it still got done being talked about a lot quicker than the VMAs. And that’s really sad. For about two days, it was on Twitter and everything, everyone had their pictures as Trayvon — and then two days later, where was it? Who cared anymore?” Miley, like, invented Sunday Funday: “I try to not work too many Sundays. At least on Sunday nights, I try to chill out a little bit. I call it Sunday Funday.” Follow Taylor on Twitter\nTags: Miley Cyrus ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TaylorBiglerDC", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyCaller"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:40:30.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
