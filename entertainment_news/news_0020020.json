Both shows have been canceled by their respective networks due to the undeniable ratings decline. The CW announced on Tuesday, October 13 that it decided not to renew \"Beauty and the Beast\" after four seasons. The show was never a ratings performer. The first season averaged 1.61 millions but the numbers were down to 1.24 million viewers per episode in season 2. Despite the decline, The CW gave it an early season 4 renewal well before season 3 debuted. Turns out, the third season only managed an average of 879,000 total viewers. Starring Kristin Kreuk and Jay Ryan , \"Beauty and the Beast\" is loosely inspired by the 1987 CBS series of the same name. Kreuk plays an NYPD detective who witnesses her mother being shot the same night she is saved from her mother's murderers by a supposed beast. Season 4 premiere date is yet announced but is expected to start airing in summer next year. Also getting the ax is Syfy's supernatural action series \"Dominion\". The show wrapped its second season on October 1 but won't return for another. It suffered a heavy ratings decline in its sophomore season with 0.3 rating in adults 18-49. The first season was 47 percent higher. Based on 2010 film \" Legion \", \"Dominion\" is set 25 years after \"The Extinction War\", when an army of lower angels, assembled by the archangel Gabriel, waged war against mankind. \"Led by [creator] Vaun Wilmott, the talented cast, producers writers and crew of 'Dominion' have done a tremendous job bringing this ambitious, cinematic series to the screen over the past two seasons,\" Syfy said in a statement. \"We thank them.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:45:06.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
