The one to duck is his Michelin-star chef, Adam Jones, in Burnt (in theaters Oct. 30), a recovering addict who hurls plates at his staff, dodges drug dealers and shoves his sous chef across the kitchen.\nThat sous chef would be Helene (Sienna Miller), Jones' equal at the stove and, eventually, the object of his affections. In real life, this pair has operated on a steady boil for the past year.\nUSA TODAY\nBradley Cooper, Sienna Miller share recipe for success\nCooper and Miller starred as husband and wife in American Sniper , which earned Cooper his third Oscar nomination. Weeks after wrapping Sniper, they hopped from the war drama into a stainless-steel kitchen.\n\"It was somewhat schizophrenic to see him, having been this big Chris Kyle and then suddenly he's in his chef whites,\" Miller says. \"But actually it was more seamless than I imagined it would be.\"\nBradley Cooper is sharpshooter Chris Kyle and Sienna Miller is wife Taya in 'American Sniper.' (Photo: Keith Bernstein, Warner Bros. Pictures)\nThe actor shed 20 pounds of Sniper weight (he had gained 40), fast. \"I'm actually still pretty big in this film,\" says Cooper, whose hotheaded chef is determined to launch a comeback and earn three coveted Michelin Guide stars (the ultimate rating in the fine-dining world).\nIn Burnt , Jones \"is lumbering. He's got a belly,\" Cooper says. \"I love that, because he stopped drinking and doing drugs 2½ years ago.\" The cook's physical shape indicates his mental state, Cooper says: \"He's just not his best self.\"\nCooper and Miller adapted differently to the demands of high-pressure cooking. Cooper had restaurant experience under his belt; his grandmother is Italian, and growing up, he was a busboy in a Greek restaurant and a prep cook at a seafood restaurant.\nSo those would be his hands shucking a crate of fresh oysters in the opening scene of Burnt. \"There's no stunt double, there's no chef double,\" he says.\nBradley Cooper plays a top chef who let bad behavior destroy his career. With help, he cleans up and returns to London determined to redeem himself. VPC\nMiller, a novice, was run through a truncated cooking school under the watch of star British chef Marcus Wareing at his two-Michelin-star restaurant, Marcus, in London. \"Marcus taught me how to cook fish and how to fillet a turbot, which is something I had to do in the film,\" she says. \"He also taught me how to make pasta, which was a really great skill because that's something I love to eat.\"\nThe star chef gifted the actress with a pasta machine, but \"it's gathering dust,\" Miller, 33, says with a sigh. \"I'm ashamed to say I haven't actually used it yet, but I intend to.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBradley Cooper loved Amy Schumer's 'SNL' monologue\nCooper, who wowed Wareing with his artful plating skills, says he's still in a bit of a food coma.\n\"It's been hard to get the last 20 (pounds) off, I'll tell you that,\" he says of his Sniper bulk. \"I'm almost 41, and it's definitely harder as I get older. I remember Russell Crowe talking about (weight struggles after) Cinderella Man and how after Gladiator , it was almost impossible for him to lose weight. I always remembered that. And then last year I went, 'Uh oh.' \"\nBradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, photographed Nov. 17, 2014, at Locanda Verde restaurant at the Greenwich Hotel in New York.
