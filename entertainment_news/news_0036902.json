Holding steady in third place was Bridge of Spies with $11.3 million. Vin Diesel's The Last Witch Hunter brought in a meek $10.8 million, landing at No. 4, followed by Hotel Transylvania 2 with $9 million. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension opened in a disappointing sixth place with $8.2 million. Despite opening wide this weekend, Steve Jobs rose only four spots to No. 7 with $7.2 million. Rounding out the Top 10 were Crimson Peak (No. 8, $5.5 million), The Intern (No. 9, $3.8 million) and Sicario (No. 10, $2.9 million). Fall TV Popularity Contest: Which new shows won you over?

Rock the Kasbah 's $1.5 million is the fifth worst opening of all time for a film playing in more than 2,000 theaters, Box Office Mojo reports, behind Jem and the Holograms , which took in just $1.3 million. That's the worst opening ever for a film playing in more than 2,400 theaters.
