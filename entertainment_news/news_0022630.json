Surprisingly for the film, in its fourth week it is being offered `FH' (fixed hire) by single screen theatres. FH is offered only to films which the exhibitors are convinced will become a hit. Usually, the producer or distributor has to pay a rent to the single screen theatres to release the film. In FH, the theatres buy the film for a fixed sum and can screen the film in their theatre as long as they wish.\nNaanu Avanalla Avalu, which so far has released only in Bengaluru, has added new theatres in the fourth week under FH outside Bengaluru even in centres like Bellary and Tiptur. Not surprisingly, the film team is elated. Director BS Lingadevaru said, \"It was Yash who suggested that we release the film only in Bengaluru first. It is difficult to find theatres for what is called bridge films. Nobody expected the film to even get a good opening. But as of now, it seems like the film will easily cross 50 days in the theatres it was released in the city. Bridge film makers like me do not even know the ABCD of film marketing.I did not even know what FH meant until a few theatres offered it a few days ago.There are other theatres in other districts and taluks which are now asking for the film on FH.\"\nSandalwood film publicist Nagendra Rao said, \"Kannada films are normally relea-sed on rental basis.Whatever the box office collection the producer or distributor has to pay a fixed rent. Another system is the sharing basis where the box office collections are shared in some pre-fixed ratio. This is the case in all multiplexes.The concept of FH in Karnataka is more or less confined to non-Kannada films. The theatres take the risk by paying upfront.\"\nLingadevaru said those who have watched the film have only praise for the film.That is the reason that after three weeks of release the film is getting better response. \"From five screens in Bengaluru alone, we will have a dozen more theatres across the state from this week. It is a great development. It is a proof that these films are not made only for the film festival circuit. The film won two national awards this year including the best actor award for a Kannada actor in 27 years. It is not just in Karnataka that the film is being purchased after three weeks. A distributor has paid advance for the UK release and we are in talks with others for release in USA. I always believe truth wins. There is nothing but honest efforts by the film to make this film and thankfully it is paying off.\"\nNaanu Avanalla Avalu traces the life of a transgender and `his' effort to become a `her'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:02:56.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
