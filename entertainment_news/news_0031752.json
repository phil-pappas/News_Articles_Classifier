We can’t screw it up.’” \nThey didn’t. \nSince remodeling and opening in March, Smokestack Brew has fast become one of the area’s premier weekend live music destinations with a huge soundstage and dance floor. Things have gotten so popular around Smokestack that Tuesday now is open-mic night, Wednesdays feature an acoustic show by Jason Sapen from the band Blammo, and Thursdays are the ever-popular karaoke nights. \nMondays? “Monday Night Football” on 19 big-screen high-def TVs, of course — with a steak and potato special that may be too special to be believable. \n“Monday nights we have steak and potato for $5.95,” Gazzana says, repeating for emphasis, “Steak and potato … five dollars and 95 cents.” \nNot just any steak, either, a New York strip with a potato — for $5.95, almost unheard of in this day and age where steak typically sells for about $13 per pound, depending on the cut and whether it’s on sale. \n“It gets people in to watch the game and have something to eat,” Gazzana says of the “Monday Night Football” and the steak and potato special. \nThere’s also burgers — the Stack Burger and the self-explanatory Pork Stack Burger are favorites — plus pulled pork, grilled chicken and ribs, including the rib basket. And, of course, wings, both chicken and hog wings. \n“Everybody’s got chicken wings,” Gazzana says, adding of the hog wings, “It’s pork. When we first opened, somebody mentioned hog wings and I said, ‘Let’s do that,’ and it quickly became our No. 1 seller.” \nA full bar is complete with 16 taps of various craft beers, mostly local or regionally sourced, including Bare Hands from Granger. \nNot that Gazzana, general sales manager at Sunny 101.5 radio, whose parent company, Schurz Communications owns The Tribune, nor partners Conway and Carl Duncan had any doubts Smokestack Brew could turn the tables on a recent history of two short-lived nightclubs — Club Bed and Sky Lounge. \nWhen they first eyed the dark, dank inside of the former boiler house of the Kamm & Schellinger building at the 100 Center, the interior brick walls were covered in black paint, black curtains dangled over huge boarded-up windows, and the ratty carpet looked to be still weathering soda and popcorn stains from the days of Dorothy’s 100 Center Cinema that shut down in 1999. \n“Actually, that was the good news when the former tenant was shut down,” Gazzana says with a chuckle of the building’s more recent history during Sky Lounge’s contentious period, which included one double-shooting in 2014. \n“We rehabbed this building,” he says of a refurbishment effort that saw the building of a giant stage for bands; the installation of large, high-definition television screens throughout the room; and a bright, fresh open-air environment that is clean and welcoming to all ages. \n“It’s smoke-free, it’s clean, we have a good crowd here,” Gazzana says, and adds that the age group of the evening “does depend on the band … You could come in on a Friday night and have someone 21, 41 and 61 here, and you could have a good time. One night, there was a young gal here … and she was 22, and I went over to the table and she introduced me to her father, and he introduce me to his father, and they were all having a good time. So it’s not uncommon to see a wide range of ages here.” \nBut Gazzana stresses that the “most important thing” at Smokestack Brew, the absolute key to the club’s success in addition to “great music … great food … is our service. You’re going to come back because you’re treated right.” \n“The most important person here,” Gazzana says, “is the person who walks through the front door.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:04:53.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
