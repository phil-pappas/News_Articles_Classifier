Shouldn't I get to do all these things since I'm already accused of them?' Blake tweets after learning of abundant false reports about him. \nBlake Shelton was surprised by a lot of false reports about him circulating on the internet, including rumors he's drunk and partying with strippers . The 39-year-old took to Twitter on Wednesday, October 7 to slam the rumors with a series of hilarious tweets. \"The stuff I read about myself blows my mind. Shouldn't I get to do all these things since I'm already accused of them? #doublejeopardy,\" Blake tweeted. \"I literally just got back from FAR northern Quebec chasing caribou and now read about all the crazy stuff I've been doing lately?!! #WTF?!\" Blake expected that the tweets he just posted would be spun by some news outlets as saying, \"Just watch and see how these tweets I just sent get spun...\" He admitted that the reports were quite frustrating and caused him to drink. \"Son of a b***h!!!! This calls for a drink,\" he wrote. The \"Sangria\" singer then replied tweets from his fans who weighed in on his previous tweets. A fan @mandaellengibbs cheekily wrote, \"@blakeshelton we may as well just get married for real now, the press would never know the difference #shotguninvegas?\" Blake jokingly replied, \"Ha Let's do it!!\" Another fan @jewel_burkhead reminded Blake that it's the consequence of being a celebrity,\"@blakeshelton That's called being a celebrity!! No matter what you do they'll turn it around so you're the bad guy!! #teamblake.\" However, Blake refused to be labeled as a celebrity as saying, \"I'm not a celebrity... I'm a country singer!!!\" Fan @ChristyThompso9 predicted the next rumors about Blake, \"@blakeshelton since you were just in Alaska I guess the next story is that you are dating an Eskimo.\" The coach of \" The Voice \" hilariously replied, \"No.. I don't need any more shrinkage...\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Blake Shelton News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:20.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
