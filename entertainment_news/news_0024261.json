In spite of, or more likely because of, this, he came first in the public vote every week from weeks four through to his victorious final. Other than ensuring that every new story about him has 'Hey now!' in the headline, Haenow's contribution to showbiz has been relatively slight. He scored the inevitable X Factor Christmas number one with his cover of OneRepublic's Something I Need, and in January he signed to Simon Cowell's SyCo record label. He has since been squirreled away recording his debut album in LA, so expect him to belt out a single or two when the new series begins.
