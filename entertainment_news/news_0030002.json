(Ian West/PA) \nThe 35-year-old, who has played a number of major Shakespearean roles including a well-received Hamlet on stage in 2004, agreed with an interviewer in The Independent’s magazine Radar that playing Q is hardly Hamlet. \n“It’s not, but not everything can be Hamlet and you wouldn’t want everything to be Hamlet,” he says. \n“It’s hard not to enjoy the excitement that it generates in people. Nothing else I’ve done has generated that much anticipation. And it’s really been lovely because it’s unusual to return to work with the same group of people on a different film.” (Ian West/PA) \nMeanwhile it has emerged that the actor’s paternal grandfather was a multilingual British spy who was planted inside the German army during the Second World War. \nThe Daily Telegraph tells how Jean Stellmacher, who was born in 1922 in Istanbul to a Russian mother and German father, was called up by the German army while at university in Istanbul. \nAfter telling a tutor of his horror at the idea of fighting for Hitler, he was introduced to a contact at the British Embassy who was attached to the intelligence services. \nStellmacher, who spoke seven languages, is said to have passed information to the British about plans for the German invasion of North Africa. In 1942 he escaped across the German lines and turned himself over to the British in Cairo. (Ian West/PA) \nThe actor told the newspaper: “His real name, and obviously mine, would be Stellmacher. But he was no more going to be in the British Army with a German name at that time, than he was going to come to England with one after the war.” Share article \nThe exploits of Stellmacher, who chose the name John Victor Whishaw, have been collected in a book, Piercing the Waves, by Stellmacher’s daughter, Ingrid, which will be published next year, the newspaper said.
