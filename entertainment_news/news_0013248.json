The singer, whose brief stint in rehab in early 2014 spawned rumors of substance abuse and relationship troubles, told Billboard that the real reason she took a break was because she was diagnosed with Lupus. She told the magazine:\n“I was diagnosed with Lupus, and I’ve been through chemotherapy. That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke. I wanted so badly to say, ‘You guys have no idea. I’m in chemotherapy. You’re assholes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.”\nUSA TODAY\nSelena Gomez stages musical, personal 'Revival'\nBeing splashed across the tabloids has been frustrated, she said:\n\"I'm so (expletive) nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me. I’ve been working since I was 7. I’ve been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17. It’s so disappointing that I’ve become a tabloid story.\"\nGomez told USA TODAY earlier this month that despite the hate, her fans keep her motivated:\n\"Not to sound cheesy. Literally, I feel like this industry has the ability to make you really hate people. Just the people I have come into contact with in the press and stuff like that, it's really disappointing to see what society and fame has become. But my heart hasn't changed. I care about people. I would love to go to dinner with everybody and just hang out and talk, and I love my fans. My fans are the only thing that's been consistent in my life.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6721973/selena-gomez-billboard-cover-sneak-peek?utm_source=twitter", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/10/04/selena-gomez-new-album-revival/72755580/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3fbfccd4032d54cb0c323ca0905bb6bf7393849e/c=867-1066-2772-2971/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793084878872229-05-SG-Interscope-01204-v02.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:13:18.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
