To convert his stand-up comedy material into a rap, Giroux teamed-up with hip-hop artist Jensen Reed, known for his album \"The Left Coast\" and collaborations with YouTube star Taryn Southern . The duo spent the next six months writing the original song and composing the track. During this time, Giroux met singer Tamyra Gray ( American Idol Season One finalist) and immediately knew she was the perfect vocalist for the song's rhythmic choruses.\nFor the video, Giroux and Reed called upon a few more friends to help, including: cinematographer Matthew Roe (DP for Michael Jackson , Linkin Park, Moby), actor David Mattey ( Better Call Saul ), supermodel and Miss Paraguay Nicole Huber, choreographer Morgan Larson ( Teen Beach Movie franchise), beat boy Gev Manoukian ( So You Think You Can Dance finalist), and dancer Caitlynn Lawson ( So You Think You Can Dance finalist).\nAs an actor, fans will recognize Giroux for his recurring roles as 'Little Zach' on the CW's popular Hart of Dixie and as 'Dark Warrior' on Disney XD's teen comedy, Mighty Med . In addition, he has appeared in guest roles on dozens of shows, including Bones, House, Psych, Anger Management, 2 Broke Girls, Henry Danger , Sam & Cat and more. Giroux has also gained notoriety for starring-in and producing a variety of popular YouTube projects, creating the FML channel (FMLvideoguys) with cult-favorite \"fail\" videos, and serving as executive producer of the FRED YouTube Channel (2.3 million subscribers).\nNow under his Small Red Cape production banner, Giroux is focused on acting and directing projects for his own channel youtube.com/BenGirouxTV , including his long-running web series, SH* TTY DATES .\nGiroux and Reed look forward to their next insane collaboration.\nWatch LITTLE DUDE ANTHEM on YouTube Now at: youtube.com/BenGirouxTV\nDirect Video Link: youtu.be/VaeRfAj7KUM\nMedia Contact: Tammy Lynn , Spotlight PR Company\n310-867-1952 / Email\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bad-ass-comedy-rap-video-little-dude-anthem-debuts-starring-actorcreator-ben-giroux-hip-hop-artist-jensen-reed-and-american-idols-tamyra-gray-300162669.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
