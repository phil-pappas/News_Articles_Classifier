There were there every pitch, every out, and it’s exciting to have that type of support throughout the playoffs.”\nThe Cubs can clinch the series with a win, something that had never been accomplished before in Wrigley Field history.\n“It’d be awesome,” Kyle Schwarber said. “I came out early and sat in the stands trying to visualize what it was going to be like and kind of control the emotions and see what the atmosphere is going to be like in my own head.\n“The fans surpassed my expectations. We’re expecting a louder crowd (for Game 4). It’s going to be tough.”\nThe Cubs are in a groove that has never been seen, setting a major league playoff record with six home runs in one game. After Game 3, Dexter Fowler was apprised of the fact that Jorge Soler had reached base in his first nine plate appearances, also a postseason record.\n“You just jinxed it,” Fowler said with a laugh. “We’re aware now, I guess.”’\nEveryone is chipping in, and everyone’s ego is in check.\nStarlin Castro said his home run in Game 3 was the highlight of his career, and the Cubs are ready to get the job done today and avoid a return trip to St. Louis.\n“We've had a lot of bad moments (in the past few years) and now we've found a way to be a winning team,” Castro said. “It’s pretty awesome. Keep going.”\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d4917/turbine/ct-wrigley-shifts-summer-to-fall-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:21:16.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
