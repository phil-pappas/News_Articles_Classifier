Airing Saturday, Oct. 24 at 7 p.m. ET /PT on CTV, CTV GO, and CTVNews.ca , W5 's MR. PRIME MINISTER offers Canadians an exclusive, up-close, post-election campaign glimpse at the country's Prime Minister-Designate in his first one-on-one interview since being elected earlier this week. From how and why he won the election, to what Canadians can expect in the days, months, and years to come, LaFlamme guides a candid conversation with the country's next Prime Minister.\nIn the second story of the evening, W5 reporter Tom Kennedy delivers EMOTIONAL RESCUE , an investigation into Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in adolescents – a particularly debilitating and often dangerous psychiatric condition which has gained recognition only in recent decades. Characterized by mood swings with little or no apparent reason, BPD can be deadly as those afflicted may take their own lives. Kennedy speaks to families, whose children took their own lives, and who wonder if an earlier diagnosis of the disorder would have saved them. W5 reveals that doctors are often reluctant to diagnose the disorder or misdiagnose it, with potentially deadly consequences.\nLast Saturday's broadcast made W5 the most-watched non-sports program in primetime when it featured an investigation into a Calgary car dealership consignment operation and inaction by the auto sales regulator in Alberta , and provided an inspirational look at Canadian charity Three To Be.\nIn addition to Saturdays at 7 p.m. ET /PT on CTV, W5 airs Saturdays at 10 p.m. ET and Sundays at 5 p.m. ET on CTV Two, and at 7 p.m. ET on CTV News Channel. W5 can also be seen on Investigation Discovery on Tuesdays at 11 p.m. ET , and Wednesdays at 12 noon ET ; on demand at CTVNews.ca/W5 , on the CTV NEWS GO app, the CTV Mobile channel on Bell Mobile TV, and through video on demand partners, such as Bell Fibe TV (visit CTV.ca for local listings).\nSource: Numeris (BBM Canada), Oct 17, 2015 – Live + Playback 4 days.\nSOCIAL MEDIA LINKS:\nTwitter:\n@CTVW5\n@LisaLaFlammeCTV\n@CTV_PR\n@CTV_Television\nFacebook:\nfacebook.com/CTV\nfacebook.com/CTVW5\nAbout W5\nWith an ongoing commitment to covering tough, relevant stories with fair and responsible reporting, W5 is in its 50th season of investigative journalism.
