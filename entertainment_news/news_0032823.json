It didn’t just surpass that picture, it shattered its benchmark, outselling “The Hunger Games” eight times over. Traffic to the online ticketer’s site surged to seven times more than its peak level in less than 24 hours. \n“This is an extraordinary time for the industry, which experienced unprecedented ticketing demand last night for ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens,'” Fandango said in a statement. “The enthusiasm for this year’s most anticipated movie is out of this world and we expect it to continue all the way to its debut on Dec. 18.” \nThere are already sellouts, particularly in Imax screenings, and to meet the demand, movie theaters are continually adding new show times, the online ticketer reports. \nMovieTickets.com did not release any data, but “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently the top selling film on its site. It represents 95% of sales over the past 24 hours. Interest in the film was so intense that both MovieTickets.com and Fandango reportedly crashed for some users.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:36:36.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
