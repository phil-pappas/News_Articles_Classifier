(It has to be New York City, given the frequent bursts of car-horn cacophony accompanying his comments.)\nNowadays, however, \"we do mash-ups\" as well, layering classical melodies over the pop tunes, he adds. \"It's more integrated.\"\nWhile performing Taylor Swift's \"Blank Space,\" Wadleigh and his Well-Strung colleagues — violinists Edmund Bagnell and Chris Marchant and cellist Daniel Shevlin — will \"introduce a Bach partita over the chorus,\" he notes. \"Not only do we have the rhythm and instrumentation, but you get that bit of classical-ness.\"\nA Miley Cyrus song shares sonic space with Grieg, while Well-Strung augments Gotye's Grammy-winning \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" with a Ravel melody.\nBut Spears' \"Toxic\" remains \"completely Britney,\" with classical additions. \"It has not been tainted,\" Wadleigh jokes.\nCombining two very different musical styles sounds tough enough, but Well-Strung ups the difficulty factor by singing the pop lyrics while playing string instruments.\nWadleigh likens the process to \"rubbing your head and patting your belly at the same time.\"\nSure, plenty of singers accompany themselves on guitar or piano, but those instruments have frets and keys, respectively, to guide their pitch.\nIn those cases, \"you don't have to think\" while playing, Wadleigh says.\nBut playing a violin, a viola or cello means \"a millimeter of adjustment of the finger\" can switch the pitch, he says. \"It's like speaking two conversations.\"\nOr, perhaps, speaking one and singing another.\nAlthough Wadleigh has accompanied singers \"in school and orchestra pits and opera pits,\" Well-Strung represents \"the first time I've been paid to sing. It's been super-fun.\"\nIt's also been a big change from the \"New York classical scene\" he belonged to before joining the quartet.\nViolinist Marchant and producer Mark Cortale founded Well-Strung almost four years ago, but Marchant's \"light bulb moment\" came two summers before the group got together, according to Wadleigh.\nThat moment occurred in Provincetown, Mass., on Cape Cod, in the summer of 2010, when Marchant was playing violin on the street to make extra money.\n\"Whenever I finished playing Bach or Handel on the street in Provincetown, I would put in my headphones and listen to Top 40 on my iPod,\" Marchant recalled in a New York magazine interview. \"People would stop me on the street and say, 'Oh, you're the violinist! What are you listening to?' And I would be like, 'I'm listening to Britney Spears.'\"\nIn Wadleigh's view, \"people's idea of what classical musicians are like is very skewed.\"\nWhich is something the members of Well-Strung counter every time they mix Mozart with Kelly Clarkson or perform a medley from Disney's animated smash \"Frozen.\"\nAfter all, \"a lot of people don't get the chance to listen to classical music,\" Wadleigh says. \"We wanted to offer both side by side.\"\nBesides, \"it's really important to seek out music, wherever it comes from,\" he adds, \"if you like it and enjoy it and it speaks to you.\"\nThat's Well-Strung's approach and, so far, he says, the response has been \"overwhelming, incredibly positive\" — even from his classically trained peers.\n\"I was curious to see how they would take it,\" he admits, but performers from top orchestras — including those in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco — \"just sing our praises.\"\nMaybe they're Britney fans, too.\n\"If the music speaks to us,\" Wadleigh says, \"we're not afraid to do it.\"\nFor more stories from Carol Cling go to reviewjournal.com.
