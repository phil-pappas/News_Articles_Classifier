I don't want to erase my history on my face. \n\"There's a window of time, a hump to get over, because it's inevitable. \n\"I love that Radiohead song 'Fake Plastic Trees:' 'He used to do surgery for girls in the '80s, but gravity always wins'. It's certainly a dialogue I have with myself. And I don't judge; every woman has to make her own choice. But, for me, it's more beautiful to see the person.\" \nThe Oscar-winner also takes time to coo about her husband of 12 years, who directed her as she played a homeless addict in gritty new film \"Shelter.\" \nCalling the shoot very \"organic\", Connelly adds, \"It was wonderful having that degree of trust.\" \nBut she has always been a big fan of her husband, ever since they worked together, alongside Russell Crowe, in \"A Beautiful Mind.\" \n\"(The things I fell in love with) are still the things I love (about him),\" she gushes. \"He's a very convivial, open, generous person. Very funny. Very respectful of women, sensitive to injustice.\" \nThe couple wed on New Year's Day 2003 and welcomed a son, Stellan, the same year. Their daughter Agnes Lark was born in May 2011.
