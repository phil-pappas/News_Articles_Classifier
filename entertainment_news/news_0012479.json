It would be too predictable. More likely, some other character will meet that gruesome, memorable end.\nBut Glenn could still be headed for a reckoning, and I don't want that.\nWho didn't know Carter (Ethan Embry) was going to die? I see no hands.\nRick (Andrew Lincoln) did both the practical thing and showed him a mercy when he killed him. A bite that tears a chunk of face – how can you manage that? As Rick predicted earlier, somebody like that, he's going to die no matter what.\nOn one level, Rick and Glenn both acted the same way - pardoning the men who plotted their deaths. But Glenn moves with an open heart; Rick operates from a darker place, which we saw.\nOne man taking it all in – Morgan.\nHow great is it to see Lennie James as a series regular? He disagrees with Rick's tactics and could become an opponent fighting for the soul of Alexandria.\nMy favorite moment of the night: When Morgan asked Carol (Melissa McBride) if she, like Rick, was a cop.\n“You're always watching. You always seem ready,” he said.\n“For what?”\n“To handle things.”\n“Aren't you sweet,” Carol responded, a perfectly Southern way of saying, “Go to hell.”\nBut that blaring horn – a zombie lunch siren – can only mean the residents of Alexandria are out of time.\nFight or die.\nWhat did you think of the season premiere of \"The Walking Dead\"?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:40:19.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
