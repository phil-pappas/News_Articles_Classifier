I have been to Birmingham quite a few times, it is the first time in Dudley but it won’t be the last,” he said. Did you go, what did you think? Are you a fan? Share your thoughts \nIn terms of X Factor he said: “I have watched as much as I can and I think it is great, getting Nick and Rita in there was great. \n“They are budding, young, really refreshing. Cheryl has been amazing this year and Simon is the King.” \nStephanie, who has recently recovered from a spider bite, said she was pleased to visit the Midlands and was planning to stay on Made in Chelsea. “I love getting to hear the different accents,” she said. “I love meet and greets. \n“I have no plans to leave I enjoy it so much.
