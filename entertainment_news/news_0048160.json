Federico Lombardi, said Francis met with \"several dozen\" people at the Vatican's embassy in Washington just before leaving for New York.Lombardi said such meetings are par for the course of any Vatican trip and are due to the pope's \"kindness and availability.\" He said the pope only really had one \"audience\" in Washington: with former students and his family members.\n\"The pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis, and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects,\" Lombardi said.\nFr. Tom Rosica, and assistant to Lombardi, told CBS News that the meeting was arranged solely by the nuncio.\nDavis, an Apostolic Christian, spent five days in jail for defying a series of federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across the country.\nA judge ultimately freed Davis on the condition she not interfere with her deputies issuing the licenses. When Davis returned to work, she confiscated the marriage licenses and replaced them with new ones saying they were issued not under the authority of the county clerk, but \"pursuant to federal court order.\"\nIs Kentucky clerk Kim Davis back in hot water? However, Davis' lawyer, Mat Staver, told The Associated Press that the Vatican initiated the meeting as an affirmation of her right to be conscientious objector.\n\"We wouldn't expect the pope to weigh in on the particulars of any case,\" Staver said Friday.\nHe said Vatican personnel initiated the meeting on Sept. 14, the day she returned to work, saying the pope wanted to meet her. He said Vatican security picked up her and her husband from their hotel and told her to change her hairdo so she wouldn't be recognized since the Vatican wanted the meeting kept secret.\nStaver disputed a Vatican spokesman's claims that the pope only met Davis in a receiving line. He said the couple was in a separate room with Francis and Vatican personnel.\nDavis said earlier this week that she and her husband met briefly with the pope at the Vatican's nunciature in Washington and that he encouraged her to \"stay strong.\"\n\"Just knowing that the pope is on track with what we're doing and agreeing, you know, it kind of validates everything,\" she told ABC.\nKim Davis speaks out on meeting Pope Francis The Vatican statement made clear the pope intended no such validation.\nNews of the audience sent shockwaves through the U.S. church, with Davis' supporters saying it showed the pope backed her cause and opponents questioning whether the pope had been duped into meeting with her.\nInitially the Vatican only reluctantly confirmed the meeting but offered no comment.\nOn Friday, Lombardi met with Francis and issued a fuller statement to \"contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.\"\nHe declined to say who invited Davis into the nunciature or what the pope knew of the case ahead of time. Such encounters are arranged by the Vatican ambassador and his staff, not the pope's delegation or the U.S. bishops' conference.\nAn assistant to Lombardi, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, said he believed the pope was unaware of Davis or the implications of the meeting.\n\"I don't think it's a matter of being tricked as of being fully aware of the situation and its complexities,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone was willfully trying to trick the pope, and at the same time nor was the pope briefed properly on who was he meeting. He wasn't properly briefed on the person or the impact of such a visit.\"\nFrom the start of his six-day tour, Francis encouraged Americans to preserve religious freedom, which he called \"one of America's most precious possessions.\" But he listed it among many other issues, including immigration, climate change and the death penalty.\nFrancis firmly upholds church teaching that marriage is between a man and woman, but he did not focus on the debate over same-sex marriage during his visit, at one point telling the U.S. bishops to avoid \"harsh and divisive\" language despite the challenges they face in society.\nAs he left the country, Francis told reporters who inquired that he did not know Davis' case in detail, but he defended conscientious objection as a human right.\n\"It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right,\" Francis said.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/25/5bef0636-2520-4161-a8e1-ae194f8796ed/thumbnail/220x140/a30c8498dc9b05a06a5d57bda02533b9/2015-09-23t202406z1277946087gf10000217560rtrmadp3-pope-usa.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:20:40.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
