(Photo: Frazer Harrison) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Metro Detroit draws a lot of strip mall, “bro” country, but it’s rare we get the authentic, honky tonk-bred sound that came out of the bars and roadhouses of the 1950’s.\nSo having Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson, 82, perform together Tuesday at the Fox Theatre is a treat. The tour started Oct. 15 to support their country chart-topping album, “Django and Jimmie.”\nIn 40-plus years of traveling America as a touring musician, Haggard has seen big changes. “There’s really no character left in America,” said Haggard, 78, by phone from his rural California home. He’s talking about the countryside, but he could be talking about music as well.\n“Everything’s the same thing, categorized to where it fits on the computer. I hate it, it’s so boring,” Haggard said. “And I feel sorry for the younger set who never got to see America. All they see now is a Wendy’s burger and a Subway. Every off ramp is the same thing. And the roads are in such bad shape, the bridges — you’re afraid to cross ‘em. The gigs are fun. But I’m really glad I got to live when I did, to experience the things I’m talking about.”\nThe singer/songwriter who gave the world “Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down,” “Misery and Gin,” “Fightin’ Side of Me” and “I Think I’ll Just Stay Here and Drink,” who repeatedly fought the law (and the law won) and endured five marriages, had character to spare when he emerged from the Bakersfield, California, music scene in the early ’60s.\nNashville didn’t know what to make of him, but they liked his music — more than 40 No. 1 country hits proved that. “Nashville wasn’t what I had in mind,” Haggard said. “I was a barroom musician, I played guitar and made a living that way, rather than having to dig ditches or some damn thing. Nashville was the recording center of the business, the home of the Grand Ole Opry, and kind of churchified. Nothing against churches, but our music came from the bars.”\nMusically, he doesn’t hold out hope that country will swing back to its roots. The music he and Nelson sing and play is becoming as hard to find as regional accents.\n“It evolved from a different way of life, a different time period in America which don’t exist anymore,” Haggard said. “The barrooms and the electric guitars being new, radio in its heyday, and the method of buying music was altogether different. If you wanted to hear music, you had to go somewhere at night. Now you can put your phone up and listen to anything you want to.”\nHe’s even recording his demos on his phone now. “I write the songs, make the demos, sent it to (producer Buddy Cannon) on the phone. He takes the best rhythm section in the world, makes me a rhythm section sends it back to me, I put my voice on it, put my guitar on it, and Benny and a saxophone player and it’s crazy and it’s no fun at all!”\nWith half a century of music in his head, Haggard can quote you lyrics and songwriters without breaking into a sweat. Told that his old friend, songwriter Harlan Howard, was born in Detroit, Haggard said smoothly: “I didn’t know that. But it makes sense, because he mentions Detroit in his song ‘Watermelon Time in Georgia’ — Lefty Frizzell recorded it.”\nThe lyric: “Thank you Detroit, you treated me good, but I’ve been here longer than I should,” is sung by a homesick Southerner who wants to leave his auto job and go back home.\nHe does like some younger country musicians: Sturgill Simpson, with his traditionalist sound, is a favorite and Haggard hopes to have the 35-year-old open some shows.\nAlthough he famously sang of being an “Okie from Muskogee,” Haggard was actually born in California in 1937, two years after his parents made the trek west on Route 66 from Oklahoma’s Dust Bowl. The family had suffered a series of bad breaks that made California’s orange groves seem like the promised land.\nHis father Jim died when he was 9. “I think I was drinking in bars when I was 12,” Haggard reckons. “I grew up quick. I was a kid that flipped over when I was young. I was actually playing in the bars when I was 16.” He says he grew up loving Lefty Frizzell, and he sang like him, too.\nDrawn to the wild side of life, Haggard was locked up in San Quentin prison in 1958. He’d broken into a bar during business hours, with his pregnant wife and baby in the car. At San Quentin, he got to see Johnny Cash handle the convict audience masterfully.\nCash was hung over and hoarse when he got to the prison. “He couldn’t even whisper, so the real reason for him being there, he wasn’t even able to do,” Haggard said. “The convicts don’t put up with any BS, and he was still able to handle ‘em.”\nOn “Django and Jimmie,” Haggard and Nelson sing a Haggard song “Missin’ ol’ Johnny Cash,” swapping stories about Cash to the boom chicka boom of the classic Tennessee Two sound. “I knew Cash real well, he was a character. He was something to write about,” Haggard said, erupting into a basso laugh.\nFeeling about 65 \nHaggard had a brush with lung cancer a few years back, but his ominous baritone is intact. “You’ve got five parts to your lungs, and they removed one part of mine,” he explained. “There was a cancer inside of it, it was contained to that, and I haven’t had any problems since.” As for his health today, “I feel like, ohh about 65 — but I’m 78,” he said.\nHe isn’t quite the vagabond he was in his freight train-hopping youth, but Haggard still loves to get out on the road. “Where I live, I don’t do much else,” he said. “ I live here on a piece of property with a bunch of ponds and a bunch of animals, and I really don’t have a lot to do. My family wants to do everything for me. So I’m anxious to go out on the road when I get a chance.”\nHaggard and Nelson met in the early ’60s at a poker game, and on the road this fall, there will be poker. “There is liable to be poker anywhere,” Haggard said, laughing. He shares Nelson’s pleasure in cannabis, although he observes the marijuana industry with a healthy Haggard distrust of government regulation.\n“Of course (the government) involved themselves with tobacco, so it doesn’t look like they’re going to bow out (of the marijuana business). They’re going to get their money, or something.”\nHaggard is very interested in current events, although his politics defy easy definition into the polarized left or right markers of today. In 1969, in the midst of the free love, flower power era, he was the guy who wrote and sang, in “Okie,” of a rural America where they didn’t “burn no draft cards down on Main Street,” or take trips on LSD, a place “where even squares can have a ball.” His follow-up hit, “The Fightin’ Side of Me” addressed his anger at those who criticized America.\nIn “Big City,” Haggard sings about leaving his job and the “dirty old city,” moving out to Montana, and “you can keep your retirement and your so-called Social Security.” Does he still feel that way?\n“Sure do. Social Security isn’t enough to live on,” Haggard said.\nHe espouses a liberal view about California’s drought, which he fears is not being taken seriously by most of the country. “People may not realize how much of their food is grown here,” he said.\nUltimately, the author of “Workin’ Man Blues,” who worked in a potato shed, pumping gas and innumerable other unskilled laborer jobs, identifies with those who scuffle for a living.\n“This is America and it should be all the way to the ground, not just America for some people,” Haggard said.\nswhitall@detroitnews.com \n\nWillie Nelson & Family Together in Concert with Merle Haggard \n7:30 p.m. Tuesday Oct. 20\nFox Theatre, 2211 Woodward Ave., Detroit\nTickets: $49-$129.
