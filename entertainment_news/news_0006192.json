Who wouldn't? But the song has to be something unique, something different. Otherwise what's the point. Working with Bachchan sahab and the three of them, won't get bigger than this,\" Trivedi told PTI.\nContinuing the trend of actors crooning their songs, the 73-year-old Piku actor has lent his voice to the track of his upcoming show.\nRecently, Salman sang the title song of his home production Hero .\nTrivedi, however, is completely fine with actors going behind the microphone, as he feels the song ends up looking more natural on-screen.\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\n\"I think it's great. Singing your own songs looks more natural and organic. There is nothing fake about it. You say the dialogues, you sing the songs too. Audience doesn't find that odd. It looks and sounds convincing,\" he said.\nWhile the composer is fine with actors singing their songs, Trivedi, who has given hits like Dev D , Lootera and Queen , does not understand the need for multiple versions of the same song in an album.\n\"I don't know why people do that. I don't see the need of having multiple versions of the same track with different singers. I never do that. But I guess everyone has a different way of working so they choose this style,\" he said.\nTrivedi's next project is Kai Po Che director Abhishek Kapoor's romantic-drama Fitoor .\nThe film stars Katrina Kaif , Aditya Roy Kapoor, Tabu, Adii Rao Hydari among others.\n\" Fitoor's music is turning out fantastic. It is a very different film and so is the soundtrack. We worked hard for almost a year for the album,\" the musician said.\nListen to Amit Trivedi songs on Gaana.com\n\"Abhishek Kapoor has a different style of movie making. I hope when the album is out people will love it. I hope it gets its due,\" he added.\nWATCH: Amit Trivedi - MTV Unplugged Season 4 - 'Zinda'", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCw2DjQZAgs", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://gaana.com/search/songs/amit%20trivedi"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:33:33.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
