Warner Bros. and Netflix both declined to comment.\nSet in the small, fictional town of Stars Hollow, Ct., the original series starred Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as fast-talking, pop-culture loving mother-daughter duo Lorelei and Rory Gilmore. It ran for seven seasons, starting out on the WB and then moving to the CW after the 2006 merger. Other actors appearing over the course of the run include Melissa McCarthy, Scott Patterson, Kelly Bishop, Edward Herrmann, Jared Padalecki, Sean Gunn, Milo Ventimiglia, Matt Czuchry and Chad Michael Murray.\nThis 2006 publicity photo released by The WB shows \"Gilmore Girls\" stars, from left, Scott Patterson as Luke Danes, Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore, Alexis Bledel as Rory Gilmore and Matt Czuchry as Logan. The show's season finale airs Tuesday, May 9, 2006.

Nobody here hates each other, which is very important,\" she said. \"It would have to be the right everything, the right format, the right timing. It would have to be honored in a certain way. And if it ever came around, we would all jump in and do it.\"\nThis project was announced on the same day that news broke of Graham working with her other famous TV show daughter, \"Parenthood's\" Mae Whitman, on an adaptation of \"Go Fug Yourself\" bloggers Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan's book, \"The Royal We.\"", "external_links": ["http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1268261/151019-gilmore-girls-cast-today-tease-150608-1857_74d57db047df07d84a3bfa41f47567d6.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1268261/151019-gilmore-girls-cast-today-tease-150608-1857_74d57db047df07d84a3bfa41f47567d6.nbcnews-ux-600-700.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1268261/151019-gilmore-girls-cast-today-tease-150608-1857_74d57db047df07d84a3bfa41f47567d6.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:04:26.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
