Comment By Andy SmithJournal Arts Writer Posted Oct. 13, 2015 @ 12:01 am PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Just a few weeks ago, on Sept. 26, Comedy Central aired \"Brian Regan: Live from Radio City Music Hall,\" the first time the network has aired a live, hour-long special of stand-up comedy. Now it's over. And, for Regan, that means it's time to write new material. \"I like to always be writing,\" Regan said in a phone interview. \"When I record an hour of stuff, I figure now it's out there and it's time for new stuff. Those jokes had been in the oven, there's a 'ding' noise, and I take the brownies out and serve them. Now we need more brownies. … I'm much more motivated [to write] after I've recorded an hour.\" Regan will be at the Providence Performing Arts Center on Saturday. \"I'll be interested to see how much of the hour can be fresh,\" Regan said. Regan, 58, has developed a reputation as a comedian's favorite, with 28 appearances on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" alone. He relishes finding humor where others might not. \"I've always enjoyed mining the everyday for humor, to look at the most mundane things imaginable and finding the humor in them. ... I like to take things that, for most people, go in one ear and out the other, and have it not go out. Let it stay in there for a while.\" So, Regan examines sports cliches — why is every playoff game a \"must-win\" game? — and common expressions for their inner absurdity. Why, for example, do we say \"leg of lamb\" but not \"wing of chicken?\" Regan only touched on politics very lightly in his stand-up special on Comedy Central but said there may be more political jokes in his future. The night before his phone interview, he said, he spent 45 minutes trying to figure out the difference between an assault rifle and a non-assault rifle, all for a possible joke. \"A performer needs to grow,\" Regan said. \"I like political comedy. I like all kinds of comedy.\" The trouble with political humor, Regan said, is that as soon as you tilt one way or the other, you start losing portions of your audience. Regan grew up in Florida, one of eight children. (In his act, he notes that the Spanish he learned in school didn't seem to be the same Spanish spoken by the cigar-smoking Cuban men on the street corners of Miami.) One of his brothers, Dennis, is also a stand-up comic. Growing up, Regan never planned on becoming a comedian. He went to school, Heidelberg College in Ohio, with the intention of becoming an accountant. At Heidelberg, he started doing comedy, and the world lost another accountant. These days, TV, movies and Internet exposure is how stand-up comedians become stars. Regan has had his share of exposure, including a brief appearance in Chris Rock's movie, \"Top Five,\" and Jerry Seinfeld's \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\" But his main focus is stand-up. \"For me, the stand-up is the end result. That doesn't mean I wouldn't be open to opportunities off the stage,\" Regan said. \"I would love to have a TV show but only if I'm sitting at the table being the creative force behind it. I don't want to be famous. I want the comedy.\" So far, Regan said, the right opportunity has not appeared. \"Hollywood seems to have a blind eye when it comes to me. No one has picked up the red Hollywood hot-line phone and given me a call.\" But Regan has made a lot of appearances on late-night talk shows. He explained there's a very different dynamic to those gigs than there is to doing a full-scale performance. Usually, he said, comedians are allotted between four and five minutes on a late-night show. \"It's a bizarre challenge to come out as a stand-up on a show like that,\" he said. \"It's very different than performing for your own fans. When I play one of my own shows, everyone has a ticket with my name on it. On a late-night show, probably most of the people have never heard of you and you have to go out and make them laugh.\" Letterman has been a longtime supporter of Regan, but Regan said he was happy Letterman was able to retire gracefully. \"He's had a long, successful career; he's been great for comedy,\" Regan said. \"It's nice, when people retire. I remember seeing a picture of Johnny Carson, right after he retired, on his yacht, ready to sail around the world. I thought that was cool. I'm a big fan of retirement.\" Here Regan disagrees with Seinfeld, who believes comedians should go on forever. Regan, however, said he has a fantasy of owning a golden retriever, which is not practical when you're on the road as often as he is. If he retired, though … woof, woof. But Regan is definitely not shopping at pet stores yet. Not while there are still (comedy) brownies in the oven. Brian Regan will be at the Providence Performing Arts Center, 220 Weybosset St., Providence, at 8 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $45 and $33.50, available at the box office, online at ppacri.com or by phone at (401) 421-2787.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:56:12.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
