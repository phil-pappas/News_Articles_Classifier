The 46-year-old songstress apparently refused to give much thought to the rumors, telling Entertainment Tonight about the dating news, \"Have you read the news?\" The No Doubt vocalist, however, gave an update on how Shelton's doing after divorcing his wife Miranda Lambert . \"It seems like the cowboy is really happy on the show,\" she said, referring to Shelton as \"the cowboy.\" Stefani who recently debuted new song \"Used to Love You\" after splitting from Gavin Rossdale added, \"We're all having so much fun on that show. Everybody is in such a good place.\" Stefani and Shelton were first rumored dating in September, but his rep quickly shot down the rumors. The \"Sangria\" crooner even poked fun at the dating rumors as tweeting last month, \"Getting ready this morning to go put in my deer plots and looked at Twitter... Damn my dating life is awesome!! Let me know what happens...\" The romance rumors aside, the two are currently working together as coaches on \"The Voice\" season 9 which airs every Monday and Tuesday on NBC. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:21.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
