Photo: Pat Scala \nEXCLUSIVE \nReigning champions of reality renovation TV show  The Block,  Deanne and Darren Jolly, are under fire from neighbours for demolishing a heritage-protected house without a permit in East Kew, in Melbourne's leafy eastern suburbs.\nA City of Boroondara spokesman said the council had immediately launched an investigation after a bulldozer mowed through the historic early-19th-century property in late September. The Jollys then applied for retrospective approval.\nThe cleared block of land in East Kew. Photo: Joe Armao \nNeighbours in the quiet and leafy street are furious and accuse the couple of riding roughshod over the law or of expecting special treatment because of their celebrity status.\nAdvertisement \nDarren Jolly, an ex-AFL player, and his wife Dea have been contestants on Channel Nine's top-rating TV show twice, and in April  won close to $1 million .\nThe Jollys bought the East Kew house in the middle of 2015 for an undisclosed sum. A partial demolition permit was obtained for the address in July, which required the front facade and roofline to be preserved, as they were of heritage value. The permit also gave permission to install a swimming pool.\nWhen Fairfax Media visited the site this week, the entire house and extensive gardens had been demolished and cleared.\nThe couple's neighbours fear that if the heritage value on the East Kew site is ignored and a large house built, it could reduce the value of the street's houses while the Jollys would reap a profit large enough to outweigh any potential fines council might levy.\nMr Jolly told the council, in a letter the couple provided to Fairfax Media, that his intention was to partially demolish the building but when he started pulling the house apart he found it was structurally unsound. \n \"I decided to take down the remaining parts of the house because it was too unstable and unsafe to stay there. As we have seen over the last couple of days how strong the wind has been and to leave the remaining house in the condition it was would have been extremely dangerous to myself and my neighbours.\"\n\"As the builder for this build I'm obliged to warrant this house for years to come for the lucky people who buy it from us, and after seeing how bad the condition of the house was in I wouldn't have slept at night knowing what was left there was unsatisfactory and I couldn't build the house structurally sound.\"\nMr Jolly says his intention is to rebuild an exact replica of the house's heritage-protected facade. He says he has kept the roofing tiles, bricks and windows and will be reusing them.\nThe Irymple Avenue home is part of a row of houses collectively known as the Oswin Street Precinct. The house is protected by a heritage overlay because it is \" one of the more intact concentrations of 1920s and 1930s housing in Melbourne.\"\nThe \"lightly treed character\" and mature gardens of the property are also of heritage value, the City of Boroondara's heritage report says. Large swathes of East Kew in the region are subject to different heritage overlays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:45:47.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
