The contemporary R&B soundtrack can’t disguise that this is warmed over ‘Dynasty.’”\nThe astute reader has guessed that I was writing about “Empire,” which was about to become the biggest new drama of the decade.\nI thereafter largely ignored the show’s first season, hoping that the rest of America would snap out of its delusion over the summer and “Empire” would return this fall with the tiny audience it merits.\nBut two weeks into Season 2, “Empire” is as big as ever, racking up more than 16 million live viewers for its debut and more than 22 million when the DVR and online watchers were added in.\nAnd once again I am standing on the outside looking in, watching the cool kids at the club while trying to convince myself that I was right and they were wrong.\nBut maybe, just maybe, I had it backward.\nClearly, this called for one of my rare and dangerous immersion experiments. As I did in years past to overcome my aversion to “Game of Thrones” and “Scandal,” I went on an “Empire” binge.\nI tried to empty my mind (not a difficult task) of prejudices about the show, and over a few days took in all 14 episodes aired so far. Maybe a fresh start would help me understand what I was missing.\nOf course, a couple of key factors I am missing cannot be acquired simply by watching with an open mind. As a white, middle-aged male, I am pretty much the diametric opposite of the show’s target audience. But I am not as out of touch as my social status might imply. I have advocated for “black-ish” and “Key & Peele.” I knew who Timbaland was before he started producing the music for “Empire.” I have – brace yourselves – Kanye West songs on my iPod.\nThere was no reason I couldn’t learn to enjoy “Empire,” right?\nSo in I dove.\nAnd that’s an apt metaphor here: Diving into “Empire” is like jumping into the Pacific in February. It takes your breath away – not in a good way – and your first thought is, “I’ve made a terrible mistake.”\n“Empire” is the story of the Lyon family, owners of Empire, a fabulously successful record company. Dad Lucious (Terrence Howard) learns that he has ALS and must decide which of his three sons will run the company after he’s gone.\nThey are Andre (Trai Byers), the eldest and the company CFO, given to wearing business suits 24 hours a day; Jamal (Jussie Smollett), the gay middle son who is a gay singer-songwriter and who upsets his father by being gay (did I mention that he is gay?); and Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray), a budding rap star who is his father’s favorite.\nInto this mix strides Cookie (Taraji P. Henson), Lucious’s ex-wife and the boys’ mother, who gets out of prison in Episode 1 and arrives at the company demanding an ownership share.\nLucious is fabulously wealthy, fabulously talented and knows everyone in the world. He talks to his friend Barack on the phone regularly. His sons also are fabulously talented and rich, and Cookie may not be rich yet, but she is brilliant and also fabulously talented. They live in the finest houses, wear the best fashions and subsist mostly on champagne, We know these things because we are told them constantly.\nNothing about the characters that can be revealed through plot and nuance can’t also be repeated endlessly by exposition. It is astonishing how clumsy the dialogue is.\nBut the Lyons have a quality far more important than their wealth or talent. They are fighters. Dirty fighters, with hair-trigger tempers. The tiniest slights are elevated instantly to Defcon 1, and swift revenge is plotted.\nAnd swift it is. A truly astonishing point about “Empire” is the pace at which conflict occurs. The Lyons, their various wives, girlfriends, boyfriends (Jamal is gay), co-workers, rivals and fellow musicians make up a large ensemble, making the matrix of clashes enormous.\nAny two characters are either fighting or plotting against a third, and time cannot be wasted on subtlety. A scheme that J.R. Ewing might have spun over three episodes, Lucious can accomplish by the first commercial break.\nOnce I become adjusted to the pace and the awfulness of it all – somewhere around the time Courtney Love shows up – “Empire” does begin to exude a certain charm.\nAnd it dawns on me what the appeal is. This is not the pathetic romantic pining of the typical soap opera; “Empire” shares its DNA with professional wrestling.\nAs a kid, I loved the black-and-white, good-vs.-bad moral struggle of wrestling, but as I outgrew that simplistic view I learned to appreciate its garish comedy. The fakery, the exaggeration, the boasting, the ridiculous rise-and-fall rhythms of a match were what made wrestling fun.\nThat’s what “Empire” is: the melodrama of pro wrestling converted to a television series and set to an R&B beat.\nIn wrestling, a punch is not answered with a plea for peace; the proper response is a dropkick. A gouge to the eye draws a folding chair to the back of the head.\nAnd so it is with “Empire.” Extort your family members, kill friends, stage robberies, sabotage recording sessions, leak hurtful videos, slip drugs to recovering addicts. Just be sure that if someone does that to you, you do worse back to them. Never give or ask for quarter.\nOnce one gets into that mode as a viewer, “Empire” becomes almost palatable. Sure, it’s trashy and ungainly and badly written. But creator Lee Daniels and his staff of writers deserve admiration for their ingenuity in expanding the conflict in new and unexpected ways.\nIn my book, “Empire” is still awful. But at least now, it’s also fun.\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:31:55.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
