She came up with the idea in summer 2014, when the Israel-Gaza conflict was at its peak, the same time as the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson was unfolding. \n“Here were two groups of people dealing with completely different historical trajectories, but both which resulted in a process of dehumanization that criminalized them and that subject their bodies as expendable,” Erakat said. “Not only were their lives more vulnerable and disposable, but that even in their death, they were blamed for their own death,” reported Al Jazeera English. \nNoura told Al Jazeera that \"Hill does not take sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but she believes in dignity for all sides.” \n“She believes in liberation for all people and she respects the organic nature of the messaging on this movement,” Erakat said. \nFor more information, check out the movement's official website here .
