Thank you to everyone for this extraordinary honor. #walkoffame.” \nThe honor coincides with Ripa’s 15th year as host on Live . Earlier this year, Ripa won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host. \nOn hand to salute Ripa were Joel McHale and fellow TV host Jimmy Kimmel, and Ripa’s husband Mark Consuelos was there to congratulate her. \n“You have to surround yourself with people that are better than you and that’s what I’ve managed to do in my career,” she said. “I joined this incredible acting community in All My Children , and it was a brilliant ensemble cast. Then I got to sit next to Regis Philbin, who taught me how to be a storyteller.” \nShe continued, “Now, I get to share my mornings with my Michaels. Both Gelman…and of course, nothing makes me happier than starting my day with my Michael Strahan, who has made me a better person.” \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
