Image 16 of 16 Chuck E. Cheese's has always served beer and wine, by the way, but now they want to be hipper 1 / 16 Back to Gallery According to harried headlines it would appear that the Irving-based Chuck E. Cheese’s is just now serving beer and wine but according to company reps, they’ve always served alcohol.\nHeadlines this week suggested that customers could now order a cup of Bud Light or a glass of merlot but as company spokesperson Alexis Linn notes that’s always been the case.\n“From the beginning we’ve served alcohol but there is a two-drink limit for drinkers,” Linn says.\nThat policy is in effect at the company’s 500-plus corporate-owned store. There are 30 or so franchisee-owned stores who have the option of serving alcohol if they would prefer. Alcohol service has varied over the years by region.\nWhat is really happening is that the kid’s birthday party headquarters is actually testing out different options at it locations to cater to millennial parents and those that fancy themselves foodies.\nRELATED: Best things about being a kid in Houston during the '90s\nMillennials are starting to have kids and according to market research they want their dining options, even when throwing a three-year-old’s “Frozen”-themed birthday, to be on par with what they have the rest of the time.\nThat means a revamped pizza menu , craft beer options, specialty coffee, churros, and free Wi-Fi. A slimmer Chuck E. Cheese now sports skinny jeans, looking more like he's about to open for the Black Keys.\nOne craft beer option and a seasonal craft beer option are the norm.\nRELATED: Innocent things from our childhoods that could be seen as offensive and even banned today\n\"We’re testing craft beers in as many markets as we can,\" Linn says.\nThe free Internet would conceivably be for parents who need to answer an urgent work email or for bored siblings to escape into an iPad.\nLinn says that their new pizza offerings beat out Pizza Hut in a blind taste test after bringing a professional chef into the fold.\nWhat the company wants to do now is cater to adults and parents as much as kids, Linn says. The company’s target age range for kids is one year to nine years old.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/17/47/10/4092430/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/31/8324693/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/76/22/8119443/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/33/74/6668044/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/26/8324523/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.chron.com/life/article/Growing-up-in-Houston-the-90s-6147483.php", "http://houston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/06/chuck-e-cheese-beer-wine/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/14/01/75/3153744/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.chron.com/life/article/Innocent-things-from-your-childhood-that-would-be-6375949.php", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/31/8324693/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/71/65/5479775/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/30/8324631/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/33/74/6668044/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/14/64/40/3360829/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/10/why-companies-make-everything-about-millennials.html#", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/26/06/12/5792388/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/33/8324820/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/12/30/72/2723483/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/26/06/12/5792388/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/60/42/2558082/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/26/8324523/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/33/8324820/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-02/chuck-e-cheese-s-latest-tune-an-ode-to-millennial-moms", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/76/22/8119443/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/34/8754948/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/14/64/40/3360829/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/60/42/2558082/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/34/8754948/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/30/8324610/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/30/8324631/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/24/71/65/5479775/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/14/01/75/3153744/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/30/8324610/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/17/47/10/4092430/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/12/30/72/2723483/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:02:10.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
