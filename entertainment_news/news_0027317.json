(AP) â€” A Pennsylvania candidate for district attorney is citing unproven sex-abuse allegations against comedian Bill Cosby in a TV ad attacking his opponent.\nDemocrat Kevin Steele is running to be Montgomery County's top prosecutor. His new ad attacks Republican candidate Bruce Castor , the county's former prosecutor, for not charging Cosby when the allegations first surfaced in 2005.\nCastor calls the ad \"predictable craziness from a desperate candidate.\"\nCastor has said there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute Cosby when a former Temple University employee accused Cosby of drugging and molesting her.\nThe current district attorney, Risa Vetri Ferman , has refused to confirm whether her office is reinvestigating the complaint by the alleged victim.\nCosby has denied wrongdoing, and settled out of court after the alleged victim sued him.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:18:50.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
