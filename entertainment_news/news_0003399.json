Schaben/Los Angeles Times/TNS) \n\"It's called 'Reload,\" said Hof. \"It's an herbal supplement that gives you energy, They say it's for erectile dysfunction. Basically, it gives you more energy. It's an over-the-counter speedy kind of product ... the pill form of an energy drink. It's not a pharmaceutical, not a prescription drug.\" \nThe Food and Drug Administration said two years ago Reload (which is the brand name) \"contains (a) hidden drug ingredient\" that could lead to dangerous reactions. \nAccording to the Post, the FDA said Reload was basically Viagra without medical oversight. \"FDA laboratory analysis confirmed that 'Reload' contains sildenafil, the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED),\" the 2013 warning said. \"This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers should stop using this product immediately and throw it away.\" Advertisement \nA Love Ranch spokesman told the Associated Press that Odom also bought Libimax Plus, another brand of sexual enhancement supplement, at the brothel's shop. The FDA has targeted the brand, saying it contains a powerful prescription drug not on the label. The drug was recalled in 2009 because of the hidden contents, the Post said. Odom -- who starred for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, among other teams -- was found unconscious Tuesday morning on the floor of a room he'd occupied at the Love Ranch since Saturday.
