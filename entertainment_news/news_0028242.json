The result was beautiful: Xian became Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas and John Travolta; while Jessy did Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Uma Thurman.\nCounterparts from Thailand and India also got to enjoy similar treatment. (The finished product is now up on HOOQ’s official Facebook page).\n‘IS THAT A REAL SWORD?’\nAside from witnessing Xian’s rare dancing skills (read: it’s Xian’s worst quality) when he recreated that infamous scene from “Pulp Fiction,” Jessy found it a challenge using real – and very heavy – swords while recreating the duel scene from “The Mask Of Zorro.”\nXian admitted getting exposed to the way Hollywood works was so fulfilling: “It’s really exciting to work with the professionals from around the world.”\nBoth Xian and Jessy are excited about the prospect of HOOQ bringing the best of Hollywood to the Philippines.\nWith HOOQ, they can watch on multiple screens and devices anytime, anywhere. The service is perfect for on-the-go Pinoys who squeeze their movie and TV fix in their busy schedule.\n“I really want to take a vacation but with my line of work, it’s really impossible. That’s why I’m hooked with HOOQ. It’s like escaping work when you watch series and movies. I could watch any movies I want and go anywhere I want, it’s as if I’m part of their world,” Jessy said.\nXian shared, “With our line of work we do a lot of traveling, that’s why my first instinct when I would need to take a break, hindi talaga travel hinahanap ko. Iniisip ko my mind needs to take a break and I can do that by watching movies.”\nOne of the fastest-growing economies in the world, the Philippines became HOOQ’s first market when it was launched here early this year.\n“Filipinos are content-savvy,” country manager Jane Cruz-Walker explained. “They’re good in finding what they want to watch and there are a lot of options now. Today, with the mobile lifestyle of Filipino people, when most would like to watch movies on their tablets and cell phones while waiting in the airport, in the salon, and even during traffic, HOOQ is very convenient and reliable.”\nHOOQ is a startup venture between Singtel, Sony Pictures Television, and Warner Bros. Entertainment. In the Philippines, it partnered with Globe to take advantage of its leadership in the mobile market.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:54:25.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
