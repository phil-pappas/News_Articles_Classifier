The directing duo told E! News that the peddler in the movie was actually the Genie (voiced by Robin Williams ). Fans noticed that the peddler, who appeared at the beginning of the film, was also voiced by Williams. That finding sparked a speculation that the merchant in the movie was the Genie in disguise. In the latest interview, the directors claimed that the theory was one hundred percent accurate. \"I saw something that speculates that the peddler at the beginning of 'Aladdin' is the Genie. That's true! That was the whole intention, originally,\" Clements explained. \"We even had that at the end of the movie, where he would reveal himself to be the Genie, and of course Robin did the voice of the peddler,\" he added. The director also shared that they wanted to reveal it at the end of the film, but due to some adjustments, they lost the reveal. \"Just through story changes and some editing, we lost the reveal at the end. So, that's an urban legend that actually is true,\" he said. Musker then added some information, explaining that \"Aladdin\" was initially set in Baghdad, but was moved to a fictional country after the first Gulf War in 1990. He also debunked another long-running fan theory that the movie was supposed to take place in post-apocalyptic world. \"But no, we never thought it was post-apocalyptic, futuristic or in some other time,\" he said. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:17:36.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
