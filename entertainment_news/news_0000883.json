Because these 'sightings' are starting to get a little too frequent.\nMars has been in the news lately, mostly because someone left Matt Damon there; but also because there have been a bunch of objects that have UFO conspiracy enthusiasts in a right spin.\nThe latest, is the below pic which some believe to be... a polar bear. K...\nVia Metro\nThe same chap who spotted 'crabs, a giant lady and Buddha on the planet, Scott C. Warring told UFC Sightings Daily:\n‘There is a reason NASA puts photos into black and white.
