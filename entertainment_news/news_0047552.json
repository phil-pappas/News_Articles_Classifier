The goal: to help marketers understand how their apps perform in real time and allow them to test the performance of apps after they’re downloaded. \nThe San Jose, Calif.-based marketing cloud giant integrated Adobe Target and Adobe Analytics . The move will help mobile teams \"move from insight to action with a mobile marketing UI designed for apps,” according to Matt Asay, vice president of mobile for Adobe. \nAdobe Target provides the marketing cloud’s personalization, optimization and messaging capabilities. \nAdobe Analytics came from the Omniture platform that Adobe Systems acquired. It includes web and mobile analytics, multi-site grouping, visitor segmentation, action alerts, data sources, cross-category analysis, video measurement and reporting and web 2.0 optimization. \nThe capabilities announced today existed before with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. Adobe today integrated these solutions to “make it work seamlessly for mobile marketers, with the addition of mobile-specific functionality such as push messaging,” according to Asay. Data Driven \nWhy Adobe in this broken-record world of marketing software promises in mobile? Asay said it comes down to data. \n“Changing a button in an app or making updates to push messaging is a relatively easy thing to do,” he told CMSWire. “But all of that has to be tied closely with robust analytics. Mobile marketers need to have a close understanding of what their users are doing, in order to make the right decisions.” \nAdobe is unique because its marketing cloud it delivers “comprehensive, integrated and actionable capabilities for digital marketers,” Asay claimed. \nThe Adobe Marketing Cloud also includes Experience Manager (Web CMS), Campaign (email marketing), Audience Manager (data management), Media Optimizer (programmatic ad-buying), Primetime (multi-screen TV platform) and Social (social management). What’s New Today? \nNew capabilities in Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target include: App analytics: Access data about user acquisitions, downloads, revenue, rankings and ratings across app stores and understand where customers are launching apps - by country, region points of interest. Set up postback URLs to advertising networks for mobile apps crediting the ad network responsible for generating a conversion event like an install, a purchase, or login. App optimization and personalization: A/B and multivariate testing delivers personalized app experiences in real-time. Mobile messaging: Deliver push notifications about breaking news, new offers or account status alerts. Send messages triggered by real-time, in-app behavior and promote new content, cross-promote apps or help users with navigation. Location-aware experiences: Targeting through beacons to develop location-specific experiences and messages for push notifications and in-app content. Unified app data, workflows: App data and workflows in one place features an app-centric user interface for integrated workflows across Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. \nAsay said the analytics capabilities offer real time insight that drives optimization and targeting with different app iterations. He boasted that Adobe’s A/B and multivariate testing offering that delivers and adjusts personalized experiences in real-time is the only such offering in the market today. \n“Adobe Marketing Cloud encompasses eight different solutions,” Asay added, “from analytics to user targeting and personalization. Our unique ability to integrate these technologies enables mobile marketers to acquire, engage and retain their users. We would say though that our unique differentiator is in our ability to integrate and leverage robust analytics, to drive the decisions that ultimately create business impact.” \nPricing on these new capabilities varies by the scale of the customer’s operations between the mobile app and the Adobe Marketing Cloud, Asay said. \nAdobe Marketing Cloud provides a partner exchange so that data from third party systems systems can be integrated with its solutions. \n“We have formed partnerships with multiple vendors in the mobile app ecosystem,” Asay said. \nThe latest capabilities will be available later this month. \nMore information:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:04:49.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
