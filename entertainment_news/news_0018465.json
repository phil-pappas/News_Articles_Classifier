New York State Police picked up Clayton in an Alpine Junction motel, Steuben County Sheriff David Cole said.\nCaton Town Justice Stephen Matusick ordered Clayton back to jail and bail was reset at $500,000 cash or $1 million real property bond. The reading of his specific charges was waived.\nClayton violated an order of protection by texting the woman who has custody of his children and trying to contact his children, Steuben County District Attorney Brooks Baker said.\nClayton arrived in court at 11:30 a.m., clean-shaven and wearing a gray T-shirt and blue jeans. He was held in handcuffs and leg shackles and winced as he sat down. The arraignment was over by 11:45.\nAttorney David Parks of Ithaca, representing Clayton, asked Matusick not to speak the charges in court.\nCole anticipated that Clayton would be arraigned on a second-degree criminal contempt charge, a misdemeanor.\nClayton, of Caton, was released Monday afternoon on bail — set at $250,000 cash or $500,000 property bond earlier in the day by Steuben County Judge Peter Bradstreet .\nDefense attorney Ray Schlather of Ithaca argued Monday in Steuben County Court that Thomas Clayton is a businessman with strong ties to the community and should be released with no bail or low bail, pending his trial.Clayton is charged in the death of his wife, Kelley Clayton, who died early Sept. 29 in their home. Another man, Michael J. Beard, 44, of Elmira, was charged late last week with second-degree murder in the case.\nSchlather, who said Clayton is eager to prove his innocence in court, contended that Clayton was playing poker with his friends when his wife died, and that GPS on his car can prove he wasn’t home until a few minutes before the 911 call was made.\nSchlather said Beard is a former employee of Clayton’s, was fired, held a grudge against Clayton and was solely responsible for Kelley Clayton’s death.\nBaker countered, saying the two men planned Kelley Clayton’s death together.\nA second arraignment for Beard scheduled for Monday evening in Caton Town Court was canceled, and Beard, who is being represented by the Steuben County Public Defender’s Office, also waived a preliminary hearing, Baker said.\nThat means his case will also now proceed to a grand jury within the next 45 days, he said.\nRight now, both men are being charged as co-conspirators, but it’s too early to tell whether they will be tried together, Baker added.\nJeff Murray contributed to this report.\nkgampel@stargazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:04:21.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
