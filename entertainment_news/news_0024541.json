(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\nSupergirl will feature plenty of DC Comics characters, including Reactron, Livewire and Red Tornado, and it mixes genres, says executive producer Ali Adler. “It’s very much an action-adventure series. It’s about an adult-sibling relationship. It has romance, it has comedy, but I don’t think it’s a romantic comedy. And, it’s an amazing visual-effects spectacular.”\nDuring a break on the DEO set — a blend of technological future and geological past that features computer banks, stalactites and the spaceship that transported Kara Zor-El, as she was known on Krypton — Benoist says she's playing two characters in very different environments.\n“You see Kara kicking ass as Supergirl. You see her triumphant and in life-or-death situations. But you also see the office workplace drama, where she learns how to be a woman from Cat Grant. She learns about friendship\" from colleagues James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks) and Winslow \"Winn\" Schott (Jeremy Jordan).\nSupergirl (Melissa Benoist), left, meets with Alex Danvers (Chyler Leigh) and DEO chief Hank Henshaw (David Harewood) in CBS' 'Supergirl.' (Photo: Cliff Lipson, CBS)\n“The strongest bond in the show is with her sister,” says Benoist, wearing her eye-catching Supergirl costume. “There’s competition. With her adoptive parents, there’s (been) comparison.”\nAlex has been acting as Kara's protector, tamping down her younger sister's desire to use her powers to let her live a normal life and keep her off the radar of potential enemies. But that protectiveness also keeps her from achieving her full capability.\nUSA TODAY\nCBS' 'Supergirl' is rare female superhero, embracing her powers\n\"It is a bit of a tangled web,\" Leigh says. Growing up, \"Alex is the star of the family, but when Kara comes into the picture, because she's so extraordinary, Alex felt an intense need to train harder, fight harder and study harder so she could feel as special as Kara already was.\"\nAlex teams up with DEO chief Hank Henshaw (David Harewood) to battle a cluster of intergalactic criminals from Krypton's Fort Rozz who are starting to arise and attack.\nAt first, Henshaw is cool to the young superhero, because she’s an alien and her ship, escaping the Phantom Zone, inadvertently freed a Fort Rozz prison transport, which followed her to Earth. Her clumsy early efforts to fight the villains makes his work more difficult.\n“He is initially suspicious of Supergirl’s arrival because it complicates his own mission, which is to bring humankind and alien-kind to some kind of peace. Her arrival stirs up a hornets’ nest of bad guys,” Harewood says. “Hank did have a real bug in his cap with foreigners coming to Earth. He views aliens as unwelcome guests.”\nKara Danvers (Melissa Benoist), aka Supergirl, left, works for media mogul Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) in CBS' 'Supergirl.' (Photo: Trae Patton, CBS)\nSupergirl echoes contemporary culture on topics such as immigration, the environment and female empowerment, although the character's gender stands out largely because most screen superheroes have been men. (Marvel's Jessica Jones is also due on Netflix next month).\n“It’s amazing that she’s female, but I don’t think that’s the overarching message,” Adler says.\nBenoist adds: \"It’s feminist in that it's equal. She has the same powers as Superman. She wants to achieve the same things.\"\n2 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1N0YhnH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810445406677386-Supergirl-Melissa-Benoist.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5df2a9fb0065c978daa280bddba9206e28743088/c=41-0-1815-1334&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812090740016897-Supergirl-Melissa-Benoist-Calista-Flockhart.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1S14QXz", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/246e2b120e2d72b12b3b9205df4f617818e52cd0/c=113-0-1887-1334&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810446910683027-Supergirl-Melissa-Benoist-Chyler-Leigh-David-Harewood.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1N0YhnH", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569768332001_Supergirl2Thumb1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5a88d61facef50ef1d3a6cc340b225d717bd2b1/c=0-88-1328-1859&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810445406677386-Supergirl-Melissa-Benoist.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1N0YhnH&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/15c300512cc2875462d508ccd335add112ae81f6/c=74-0-2623-3399&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810482691384389-Mehcad-Brooks-Melissa-Benoist-Supergirl.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569695880001_Supergirl2Thumb2.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/87c18951dc76164dbe9b7b00682c7874aa9a963a/c=0-0-1560-1560/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811294512395203-Supergirl-Benoist.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1N0YhnH&text=Behind%20the%20scenes%20with%20%27Supergirl%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810445406677386-Supergirl-Melissa-Benoist.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569768332001_Supergirl2Thumb1.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569768332001_Supergirl2Thumb1.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "published": "2015-10-25T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:32:31.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
