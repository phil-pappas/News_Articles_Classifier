In a conversation with Lipika Verma during the shooting of an untitled film in Ramoji Rao Film City, Hyderabad, he shares his joy on the Tollywood entry of his son Roshan through Nagarjuna’s Nirmala Convent and his captaincy at the charity event Crescent Cricket Cup (CCC) match.\nHappy dad Srikanth is brimming with pride on his son’s maiden venture. “Roshan is playing the lead in Nirmala Convent. It’s the story of a schoolboy. However, he won’t sign up for any movies right now. After completing his studies, I will launch him after three years,” he reveals.\nRoshan, who is a diehard cricket fan, was chosen to play for the CCC, but the Class XI student had to drop the game as the parents felt his studies were neglected.\nThe charity match, which opens today, is a proud event for Srikanth, who is one of the captains of the two Tollywood teams, which will be pitted against each other on Tuesday. “We will be playing opposite Tarun’s team. More than participation, our focus in on victory. I am not a strict captain. Even if my players miss one catch, I don’t pressurise them. Instead, I tell them to try to catch the ball next time.”\nA winner of two Nandi Awards and a Filmfare South award, the talented actor, of late, chooses to concentrate on just one or two movies a year. “I am currently working on two untitled projects and I’m also waiting for Satish Kasetty’s next film Terror.”\n Tollywood Srikanth Cricket Roshan Also Read Fiery Dale Steyn rips apart Sri Lanka at Galle on batting friendly track Chakri was not poisoned: Forensic Science Laboratory Amla reaches 5,000 runs in record time as South Africa crush West Indies Sri Lanka seek revival in Pakistan T20s", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/12SRIKANTH.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/entertainment-tollywood/article/‘i’m-not-strict’", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/12SRIKANTH.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:30:26.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
