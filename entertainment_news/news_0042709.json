Sometimes it bestows its gentle, warming glow on folks and, quick as you can say Fairlie Arrow, they're gone. Poof. Like that. Never to be heard from again, until they surface on Where Are They Now? or win a weekly spot on Sunrise . And other times, fame's searing heat is like The Towering Inferno : unpredictable but overwrought. Case in point: Amy Schumer, whose ascending star is in danger of getting vertigo.\nSchumer seems to have achieved in the space of a year what it took her forebears, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, a decade to do; and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who came before them, two whole decades. It's either a sign of her astonishing talent, or merely a sign of the times. Were she not riotously funny, Schumer would be in danger of busting a Kardashian and burning out in a vaporous cloud of her own red-hot celebrity. But she has the one thing the Kardashians do not. And that is talent.\n\nSchumer takes to the stage in Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo (Comedy Channel, Sunday, 9.50pm), a comedy special that strips away a lot of the noise and puts her back on the stand-up stage, with nothing but her engaging wit to hold proceedings on track. It's very nicely done, and Schumer is an engaging presence on the centre of the stage. \nAdvertisement To some extent, though, Schumer feels almost like a deconstruction of comedy, a sort of everywoman meets the girl next door, with a gentle and seemingly bewildered sense of the world around her. The result is that her comedy seems effortless, and properly authentic.\nThough it's a leitmotif employed by many comedians, Schumer's brilliance may be that she is able to tweak it ever so slightly and, somehow, make it seem fresh when she delivers it. In truth, that's the art of everything on television. Retooling what's been done before just enough to make it seem entirely new. And concealing complex structure behind an elegantly plain facade.\nIndeed the latter point may also explain the astonishing success of Fargo (SBS One, Wednesdays, 9.35pm) which returns for a second season. Fargo made its television debut somewhere around the same time as True Detective and for that reason, and a few others, the two programs were uneasily compared at every stage of their gestation.\nSome could argue that True Detective's first season set it apart from everything else on television. The long and the short of it, however, is that unless they added the words \"except for Fargo \" they'd be idiots. For as the two programs unfurled their first seasons, it became very clear, very quickly that Fargo was superior. \nIt's a point that has been proven powerfully as both have unveiled second seasons. True Detective's fell profoundly short of expectation, while Fargo's looks crisp and delicious.The second outing of Fargo dials back the clock to 1979, where Lou Solverson - who we met as an older man in season one - is a young state trooper.\nPerhaps the only real shame in Fargo 2.0 is that we don't have the first season's amazing cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Allison Tolman​. But we have the next best thing: Patrick Wilson as young Lou, Ted Danson as the sheriff, Hank Larsson; and Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons​ as Peggy and Ed Blomquist.\nThe fingerprints of writer Noah Hawley and director Randall Einhorn​, who worked on the first season, are all over this, and that could explain the smoother transition from season one to season two. There is a new rhythm though, perhaps due to the addition of director Michael Uppendahl​. Whatever the recipe, they have it right, and tight. Fargo was the best thing on TV in 2014. Fargo 2.0 looks certain to follow suit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:22:51.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
