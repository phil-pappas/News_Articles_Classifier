(Photo: Raghav Peri) \nA 40-minute short film shot in Newark, Wilmington, Bellefonte and Philadelphia will get its first screening at the Penn Cinema Riverfront (401 S. Madison St., Wilmington) this weekend. \nNewark filmmaker Raghav Peri , 27, wrote and directed the drama. \n“Bar Study” follows Rob (Philadelphia actor Mike Robinson) – a man who goes to a bar every day to study others, fascinated by fellow human beings. And it’s a fascination that may or may not end with a killing. Delaware’s $10,000 ‘Star Wars’ tickets \nPart of the film was shot at Oddity Bar in Wilmington and Oddity bartender/musician Devo Devitt even appears. \nThe film will be shown at 7 p.m. Saturday at Penn Cinema followed by a question and answer session with Peri and the cast. \nTickets are $8. VIP tickets are also offered for $30 and $15. Proceeds from the VIP tickets will go to Uplift A Child , a Maryland-based nonprofit organization that supports underprivileged children with schooling. \nVisit facebook.com/BarStudyMovie for more details and tickets. \nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.
