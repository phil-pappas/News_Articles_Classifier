You Won't Be Able To Once Adele Releases New Album Cody LaGrow \nPhoto Credit: Getty Images / Kevork Djansezian \nDon't you remember Adele? British, beautiful voice, makes listening to music a tearful, heart-wrenching, make-you-call-your-ex experience? \nGreat news! We'll all be crying on the couch with a pint of ice cream while watching \"Love Actually\" and blaring new music from Adele very soon! \nThe soulful songstress tweeted confirmation that we are on the brink of a new album release. Adele said, \"My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I'm making up with myself.\" \nWait. Making up with yourself? What does that even sound like? For me, its something like, \"Cody, you're better than this! Stop crying in public!\" But for Adele, it sounds like this. \nAdele brought the world to a halt earlier this week when she released a 30-second ad during \"The X Factor\" U.K. The covert commercial instantly made Adele a worldwide trend on Twitter and hinted at what her new album will sound like. \nStill no word from our old friend on exactly when we can expect the album. But rumor has it Adele will release it sometime in November . \nAdele added, \"I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\" \nNo apology necessary, boo. I'm not sure I've processed all my emotions you made me feel from the last album. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:52:54.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
