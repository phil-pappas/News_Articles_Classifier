She said she met him in an Orange County residence, hoping \"it might lead to an opportunity with Playboy\" because Cosby knew Hugh Hefner.\nDuring the meeting, the producer called Cosby and said they would be on the \"next flight to Las Vegas,\" she said. Abeyta and the producer left for Las Vegas and met Cosby in a dressing room of the Las Vegas Hilton after he finished a show, she said.\nCosby brought her to the Elvis Presley suite in the hotel and showed her to her own room, she said. They went downstairs and he gave her $200 to spend on gambling while he mingled with others. She went back to the suite around 1 a.m.\nAfter she awoke the next day, Cosby told her to buy an evening gown for the \"champagne dinner\" during his show. She spent $2,500 on clothing, shoes and a clutch bag for the event, charging it to his room, she said.\nAt the show, she remembers having food and drinks before blacking out.\n\"Everything became a blur,\" she said. \"I believe that someone put something in my drink.\"\nShe remembers waking up twice in Cosby's bed and seeing him once before allegedly blacking out again. She woke up the next day in her own room in the suite and left soon after, she said.\n\"I got up and left the hotel the next morning not even knowing what went on through the night. I barely remember how I got to the airport or even how I got home. I know I flew home, but it was all in a fog,\" she said.\n'You owe me'\nFormer model and actress Lisa Christie said she was 18 when she met Cosby on the set of \"The Cosby Show.\" He chose her out of a line of models and took an interest in her career, she said.\nLisa Christie The relationship lasted about two years, from 1987 to 1989, before he tried to pressure her into sex in a hotel room, she alleged. At the time, she says she considered him a \"father figure.\" Now, she said she believes he \"waited\" for her because he knew she was a virgin.\nAfter college, she says was offered a co-host position for an NBC affiliate show \"Wedding Magazine.\" Cosby flew her to Chicago to see if she should pursue a career as a television actor. He also told her he wanted her to audition for his film \"Ghost Dad.\"\nUnder the pretense of an \"acting exercise,\" Cosby told her to close her eyes before leaning in to kiss her \"like a boyfriend,\" she said.\nWhen she resisted, he told her \"you owe me,\" she said.\nWhen she rebuffed his advances, he retreated to his room, telling her: \"This is your last chance if you want to make it in this business, you have to sleep with me.\"\nBook on alleged sexual advances\nShe apparently described the ordeal in a book she released last year -- but did not name Cosby. She read from the book at the news conference.\nIn that passage, Christie describes an incident with a man who propositioned her. She wrote that the man's son died a week later. Cosby's son died in 1997.\nBut at the news conference, she said Cosby propositioned her in the late 1980s.\n'I was one of the fortunate ones'\nAllred said the book had a mistake, which she blamed on clumsy editing that will be corrected.\n\"I was one of the fortunate ones. Now I'm here to support all the victims,\" Christie said during the news conference.\nCosby accuser in July: 'At last we are being validated'\n'Mr. Cosby started getting fresh'\nSharon Van Ert was a cocktail server at Concerts by the Sea, a jazz club in Redondo Beach, when she says she met Cosby.\nSharon Van Ert One night after a few drinks with co-workers and customers post-closing time, she said, Cosby walked her to her car.\nShe remembers feeling dizzy as she got into the car and Cosby asked if she was capable of driving home. She got in the driver's seat to regain composure, she said, and Cosby got in the passenger's seat.\n\"After a while, Mr. Cosby started getting fresh. He was touching me and rubbing my leg. The next thing I remember was waking up in my car, my head hanging down from the seat, alone,\" she said in between tears.\n\"I knew I was drugged because I threw up and I never threw up or drank too much. I believe that he must have put something in my drink while we were closing up the place.\"\nWhen she got home, she realized she was missing her panties.\n\"I believe that Mr. Cosby took them after he assaulted me.\"\nJuly: Cosby accuser talks to CNN\nFallout continues\nThe fallout from the controversy over the sex assault allegations against Cosby has been swift. Reruns of \"The Cosby Show,\" his landmark 1980s sitcom, have been pulled from the airwaves and other projects and tour dates have been scrapped.\nAllred noted Wednesday that statute of limitations prevents Cosby from facing criminal charges. But a California judge ordered Cosby in August to give a sworn deposition in a civil suit alleging he sexually abused a teenage girl more than 40 years ago.\nCosby is scheduled to answer questions under oath from the accuser's legal team on October 9.\nCosby admitted pursuing younger women in deposition", "external_links":
