The company's platform generates great value, particularly in the IT department, where cost savings on professional services can be as much as 75 percent.\"\nThe SpiceCSM platform has been designed with simple application programming interfaces (APIs). They can be easily integrated with a wide range of high-end customer relationship management and helpdesk applications such as BluePay, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, and in-house proprietary systems. This solid integration ensures that the client's investment in these applications can be extended, connected and leveraged without disruption, and all in the cloud.\n\"Along with its product feature richness, the SpiceCSM platform delivers impressive return on investment due to its impact on a range of contact center processes,\" observes DeSalles. \"In actual use cases, the SpiceCSM platform was able to increase close rates in sales organizations by 12 percent, raise customers' internal satisfaction by 45 percent, as well as lower agent training time by 15 percent, average handle time by 25 percent, and call volume by 37 percent.\"\nThe Spice CSM platform has been designed with simple-to-use application programming interfaces. They are easily integrated with a wide range of high-end CRM and Helpdesk applications that clients already use. \nEach year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to a company that has developed a product to suit market and client needs.
