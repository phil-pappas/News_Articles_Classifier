Courtesy of Next Act David Cecsarini (in foreground), who played the title role in “Bravo, Caruso!’ in 2003, will do so again in November. By Jim Higgins of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 13, 2015 11:08 a.m. (0) Comments \nNext Act Theatre will replace its previously announced holiday show, \"unSilent Night,\" with a new production of \"Bravo, Caruso!,\" the theater announced Tuesday. \nLocal theater artist John Kishline is writing \"unSilent Night\" with Next Act producing artistic director David Cecsarini; the playwrights decided the original holiday show would be not ready in time for its scheduled Nov. 12-Dec. 6 slot, so it's being bumped until next season. \"Bringing an original script into being is a delicate matter with many moving parts,\" Cecsarini said in a statement. \nCecsarini will play the title role in \"Bravo, Caruso!,\" which Next Act previously performed in 2003. Edward Morgan will direct the new production. In his review of that 2003 production, Journal Sentinel theater critic Damien Jaques wrote, \"In a performance that deserves the accolades once lavished on his character, David Cecsarini becomes Caruso. He's funny, warm, engaging and even looks like the singer. We rarely have the sense that he's acting.\" \nNext Act will contact season and individual ticket holders about their options.
