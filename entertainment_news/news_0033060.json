Chicago has been experiencing dry conditions for three weeks. Since Oct. 1, the city has officially recorded only 0.18 inches of rain at O'Hare International Airport, but at least some rain is possible Friday afternoon through Saturday morning and heavier rain is likely Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThe latter system might include moisture from Hurricane Patricia, which is threatening portions of the Pacific Coast of southwestern Mexico. Texas, suffering from drought, has received heavy rains in recent days and, if forecasts come true, much more rain is expected Thursday through Monday.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Tom Skilling Weather", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562869cb/turbine/ct-wea-1022-summary-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:22:37.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
