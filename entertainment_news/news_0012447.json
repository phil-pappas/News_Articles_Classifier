The Knot Dream Wedding program continues its annual tradition of letting America choose key wedding elements, from the flowers to the dress, but this year it will also raise awareness and donations for pediatric cancer through Devon and Asha's Charity Registry on TheKnot.com, powered by Crowdrise. Devon's 5-year-old daughter, Leah, has been battling stage 4 neuroblastoma since June 2014 , and in March 2015 , doctors confirmed that she is in remission. In May 2016 , Leah will lead the couple down the aisle as their flower girl.  Thousands of NFL fans have followed Devon and Leah's story since 2014 and learned more about Leah's courageous fight at the 2015 ESPY Awards. Devon accepted the Jimmy V Perseverance Award on behalf of Leah, and during his acceptance speech , he thanked many people, including his fiancee, Asha, for being there: \"We didn't have the typical engagement where we sit down and plan everything because I didn't want to plan anything until I knew that my daughter was going to be able to walk down that aisle as our flower girl. I thank you for being so unselfish, and I promise you, I'm going to try to give you the wedding of your dreams.\"  \nWhen wedding experts at The Knot heard Devon's speech, the decision to offer this selfless and loving couple the Dream Wedding, as well as provide a platform to raise funds and awareness for pediatric cancer, was made without hesitation. The Knot is honored to bring Devon and Asha's wedding vision to life and provide family, friends and fans with the ability to donate to a pediatric cancer foundation in Leah's name. The couple will be fundraising for the Still Strong Foundation, The V Foundation for Cancer Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, through their Charity Registry, content and programming on The Knot, and visits to pediatric cancer hospitals. \n\"Asha and I cannot wait to get married, and we're thrilled that The Knot will help us pull off our perfect day while we continue to focus on Leah's battle with cancer,\" said Devon Still . \"Our wedding will be filled with tears of love and joy, and through The Knot Dream Wedding and our charity registry, we aim to help other families' tears be filled with love and hope too.\" \n\"Devon and Asha have an incredible love story,\" said Kellie Gould , editor in chief of The Knot. \"Their desire to raise awareness and funds for pediatric cancer in lieu of wedding gifts is inspiring to so many of our couples on The Knot, as well as NFL fans and Devon and Leah fans.
