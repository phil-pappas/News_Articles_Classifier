It also highlights the far-reaching goals of Russia's military involvement in Syria.\nMoscow began launching airstrikes in Syria on Sept. 30, and Syrian troops and allied militiamen began a ground offensive against rebels in central Syria a week later. Russia says its airstrikes are meant to weaken the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) and other terrorists in Syria, but Western officials and Syrian rebels say most the strikes have focused on areas in central and northern Syria where extremist group does not have a strong presence.\nThe arrival of Iranian troops reinforces fighting under the cover of Russian air power further strengthens the view that Russia's main goal is to shore up Syrian President Bashar Assad's embattled government.\nPlay Video 60 Minutes Overtime President Obama on Russia's military moves in Syria Steve Kroft asks Obama whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"challenging\" his leadership in Syria\nThe official, who has deep knowledge of operational details in Syria, said the Iranian fighters began arriving in Syria about two weeks ago, after the Russian airstrikes began, and have accelerated in recent days. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group has also sent a fresh wave of fighters to Syria, he told The Associated Press.\nHe said the Iranian fighters were arriving at Damascus airport and transported to a military base in the coastal town of Latakia from where they were deploying on the ground - mainly in the central Hama province and northern Aleppo province.\nHe spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss military affairs.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported Wednesday that Iranian troops were arriving in Syria and were transported to the military base in the town of Jableh.\nIranian and Syrian officials have long maintained that Iran has advisers and military experts in Syria. Wednesday's news is the first confirmation of Iranian fighters taking part in combat operations in Syria.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/11/c1ebeee1-f22a-40eb-a2cf-dd8633a4ec16/thumbnail/220x140/f96c73977a7a368cadd4592e4484cdca/otobama1syria455345640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:01:10.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
