It was first introduced on the silver screen in the very first film starring the super-spy, the classic \"Dr. No\" from 1962 starring Sean Connery as 007.\nIn the film, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), who had metal prostheses in place of his lost hands, reveals to Bond that he belongs to the criminal network.\n- 'Bumps and bruises' -\nBautista, who stands at 6'4\" (1.93 meters) and whose enormous biceps are liberally tattooed, certainly looks the part of a formidable Bond nemesis. \nView gallery Dave Bautista stands at 6'4\" (1.93 meters) and his enormous biceps are liberally tattooed ( … But he said the choreographed on-screen fighting with the spy in the form of Daniel Craig did not always go smoothly, despite his time as a wrestler and mixed martial artist.\n\"There were lots of bumps and bruises,\" Bautista said. \"Daniel hurt his knee.\" \nDid he emerge unscathed? \"Dan punched me in the nose,\" he said.\nBautista had more tender remembrances of his interaction with his female co-stars.\nHe admitted to going weak in the knees around Italian actress Monica Bellucci, calling her \"breathtakingly beautiful but extremely sexy.\"\nAs for French actress Lea Seydoux, who also appears in the movie, Bautista was impressed by her soft beauty.\nView gallery Actors Michael Rooker (L) and Dave Bautista attend Marvel's 'Guardians of The Galaxy' pr … \"There's something almost angelic about her,\" he said. \"When she smiles, she lights up a room.\"\n- Youth of hard knocks -\nBautista, an American of Filipino descent, grew up in a neighborhood where violence and crime were common.\nAs a teenager, Bautista discovered bodybuilding, which he credits as ending his stint as an underage car thief.\nHe worked as a bouncer, and in the 2000s launched a career as a professional wrestler.
