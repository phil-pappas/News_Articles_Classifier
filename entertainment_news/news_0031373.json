She expressed the hope that all children, and in particular girls, can receive the benefit of a good education, which, she emphasized, is her \"Chinese dream\". The First Lady's address and initiative resonated with Perfect World and everything that Perfect World stands for.\nPerfect World has, for a long time, been promoting the cooperation between youth education and cultural exchanges and had reached a consensus on cooperation with UNESCO, Columbia University , the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the College of Europe . At the same time, Perfect World has given its full support to the Sino-U.S. Zhi Xing China exchange programs for young and talented individuals. Early this year, Perfect World launched the Global Young Leader Lab program and, in June, met the first group of young American delegates of the Zhi Xing China programs. The delegation was led by Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong. On September 22 nd , Perfect World attended the Seattle banquet by invitation of the National Committee on U.S.-China-Relations and heard President Xi's only public strategy speech during his visit to the U.S. The following day, on September 23 rd , Perfect World was invited to attend the U.S.-China Internet Industry Forum.\nPerfect World's moves are intended to pave the way for the training of talented individuals and cultural exchanges on the basis of international cooperation and to further provide platform support worldwide for talented individuals who are in need of such support, and, in doing so, further boost educational exchanges between the world's leading young talents in the fields of education and culture.\nWith the successful conclusion of the Education First initiative, Perfect World has also brought its series of initiatives in the U.S. to a successful conclusion. In the future, more Chinese companies like Perfect World are expected to commit themselves to educational and cultural exchanges worldwide as part of an overall effort to promote similar exchanges on a global scale.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275636\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-based-perfect-worlds-initiatives-to-bolster-youth-education-and-cultural-exchanges-come-to-successful-conclusion-in-the-us-300157569.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-based-perfect-worlds-initiatives-to-bolster-youth-education-and-cultural-exchanges-come-to-successful-conclusion-in-the-us-300157569.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN24434&Transmission_Id=201510100433PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN24434&DateId=20151010", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151009/275636", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275636"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:44:15.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
