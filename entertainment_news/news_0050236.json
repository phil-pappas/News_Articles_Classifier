ShopRite corporate chef Lynn Logg has developed a recipe that blends lobster, fresh herbs and other ingredients into ShopRite Kitchen brand prepared mac and cheese. The dish will be among festival samples, demonstrating an easy option for entertaining.

Those who add $40 to the admission price will have access to rare, exclusive or limited vintage wines in the Wine Gems Collection Room presented by Wine Spectator magazine . \nThose who buy New York City Wine & Food Festival tickets will be helping fight hunger beyond their own as they take their fill. Event proceeds benefit the Food Bank for New York City and Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign, with more than $8.5 million raised to date. \nThe Grand Tasting offers an opportunity to sample premier wines and spirits along with popular fare from local restaurants and novelty sweets shops as well as products and recipes developed by major food and cookware brands. It is the festival's centerpiece event, taking place in addition to sell-out cooking classes, tasting sessions, foodie talks, late night parties and more running Oct. 15 through 18.
