McG also serves as executive producer along with Ed Decter. On how much was borrowed from the books, Decter said, \"We are not following the books one to one with the seasons. However, what we're doing is we're borrowing. We may set something up that we know happens in season 6, but start setting it up now.\" The NY Comic Con panel also debuted a 6-minute clip from the pilot. A man walks down the street, being followed by Alec who quickly disappears when the man looks back. The man reveals himself as a demon and Alec, joined by Isabelle and Jace, follow him to Pandemonium.
