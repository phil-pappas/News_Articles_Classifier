For the month of October, Last Concert has some new artists in store for café-goers. The month’s lineup goes as follows: Oct. 23: Jon Wayne & the Pain\nThe electronic reggae-dub has created a unique sound that sets them apart from other electronic, dubstep and reggae music of its time. Come hear the fusion of electronic beats, upbeat traditional reggae roots and a topping of grooving funk that will keep souls dancing and moving until the last note is played.\nOct. 24: Russian Festival\nOct. 25: TKoh!\nWhat started as a friendly hang out has resulted in seven years of successful music-making and touring under the name of TKoh!
