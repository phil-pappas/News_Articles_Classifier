Just profound friendship.\" \nShe previously dated Johnny for two years before their break-up in 2010, but they have remained good friends. \nKaley and Ryan wed on New Year's Eve, 2013, and just days before her split announcement, she insisted her husband and her ex had become pals. \nShe said, \"We dated, like, five years ago so I think we've both moved on... Johnny is actually one of my best friends. It's a situation that ended well... Ryan loves him, Johnny loves (Ryan), it's been a long time, so it's great. I got lucky.\" A photo posted by @normancook on Oct 14, 2015 at 10:56am PDT Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:43:56.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
