Che Chesterman (Syco/Thames TV) \n“I think Che Chesterman has an out of the park voice, vocally, but I’m not worried, I’m bringing the A-game, we’re going all out,” she said. \nRounding off the final twelve acts for the live shows are Bupsi, Anton Stephans, Max Stone, 4th Impact, Alien Uncovered, Reggie n Bollie, Louisa Johnson, Lauren Murray and Kiera Weathers.
