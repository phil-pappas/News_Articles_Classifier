The analysis is based on Timetric's extensive survey of over 100 decision makers across 76 operating mines throughout Latin America .\n\nAreas of analysis include:\n\n- Customer preferences for maintenance and aftermarket support structure. These include opting for either original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or independent third parties as providers of three equipment parts categories: strategic parts, non-strategic parts and processing-related equipment. \n\n- After sales equipment support preferences across three options; 'work with me', 'do it for me'; and 'do it myself'. \n\n- Preferences for type of service contract, including maintenance only, operation and maintenance, and life cycle management. \n\n- In each case responses are analysed by mine type, company size, commodity and major country ( Peru , Chile , Colombia and Brazil ).\n\nSummary \nOverall trends in the data revealed:\n\n- While OEMs dominate the supply of strategic parts with 45% choosing purely OEMs and 54% a mix of OEMs and third parties, third parties have a greater penetration of non-strategic parts. Availability of spare parts is a key weakness for OEMs, which provides third parties with an opportunity to gain further share unless the OEMs improve their supply and logistics structures.\n\n- After-sales equipment support preferences show over half (53%) of respondents want regular input from their manufacturer, whilst 35% prefer to outsource support work, the largest share of any mining region.\n\n- Service contract preferences show miners favor operation and maintenance contracts (40%) ahead of the simpler maintenance-only contract (36%), while life cycle management is the least preferred but still favoured by 22% of respondents.\n\n- Opportunities for life cycle management services are greatest within Peru and Brazil , and for the base metals and iron ore industries.\n\nScope \n- The report is based on responses from a survey of over 100 senior decision makers at operating Latin American mines, responsible for the purchase of equipment for plant and mine operations, along with its consumables.\n\n- Survey respondents came from 14 different countries including: Peru , Chile , Colombia , Brazil , Mexico , Venezuela , the Dominican Republic and Bolivia .\n\n- This included four main commodity groups and a range of surface and underground mining operations.\n\nReasons To Buy \n- Understand mining companies' use of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or third parties for equipment parts and for processing equipment needs. Also how these preferences vary by commodity, company size and country.\n\n- Gain knowledge of mining company preferences for after-sales support structure, and identify the services required based on mine type, company size and commodity.\n\n- Identify the service contract preferences of mines throughout Latin America , and compare across mine type, commodity group, country and company size.\n\nKey Highlights \n- For strategic parts and processing plant and equipment parts, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) dominate with 45% and 47% of respondents purely sourcing parts from OEMs.\n\n- When comparing mine types, surface mines use third parties more for strategic parts, but only marginally. Surface mines also have a greater use of third-party parts for non-strategic parts and for processing equipment.\n\n- Some 53% of respondents want regular input from their OEMs for after-sales support, with 35% looking to outsource all their support requirements, the highest share across all regions.\n\n- The majority of respondents prefer the operation and maintenance support structure, followed by the simpler maintenance only structure. Lifecycle management was the least preferred of the three structures, but has the best prospects in Peru and Brazil , and within the base metals and iron ore industries.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03331146-summary/view-report.html \n\nAbout Reportlinker \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
