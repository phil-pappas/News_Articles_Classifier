He puts it down to baking being a \"joyous, sharing activity\".\nAdvertisement \"There are not many people bring a roast leg of lamb into the office for everyone to share,\" he points out. \"But on a Monday morning people will bring in some leftovers from their baking.\"\nCampbell has even issued a \"niceness\" directive to the production team, insisting the atmosphere on set is kept as light as a prize-winning Victoria sponge.\n\"If you're grumpy you take it outside,\" he says. \"You don't talk about it in front of the other crew, you don't talk about it in front of the bakers. All those things go to create a better working environment.\"\nThe two judges on the show, high-profile food personalities Maggie Beer and Matt Moran, also seem to be having a good time.\n\"It's been a lot of fun,\" says Beer. \"We haven't stopped laughing.\"\nShe confesses she has even shed a tear or two over one contestant who had something \"very, very special\".\n\"They have been a wonderful group,\" she says. \"There have been a few tears along the way but nothing hysterical.\"\nBake Off is based on the BBC show, The Great British Bake Off . Now in its sixth series it has been a break-out hit, garnering massive ratings and having an unexpectedly wide cultural impact. The show is even credited with sparking a revival of interest in the Women's Institute in Britain.\nThis is the second outing for Bake Off in Australia. The first series, produced in 2013 for Channel Nine and featuring Shane Jacobson, didn't quite grab the attention of viewers, but Foxtel is hoping it's got the mix right for this latest version.\n\"This is really formatted off the English version, which everyone loves,\" says Moran. \"Why would you want to change it?\n\"Everyone can relate to baking, whether you are a young kid baking biscuits or whether you are a 90-year-old grandmother still making scones.\"\nTwo of the key ingredients in the new Bake Off are Hooper and Buttle, who riff off the judges and contestants, playing up the good-natured dagginess of the show.\nButtle says the 10-part series has seriously stretched their inventiveness when it comes to baking puns and wisecracks.\n\"It's not like I had a file full of jokes about vanilla slice,\" she says. \"We've had to write jokes on the spot all day every day since we started.\"\nBut in the end (as the late, great Frank Carson used to insist), it's all about the way you tell 'em, says Hooper.\n\"It's all in the sell,\" she says. \"There have been a few jokes where I have had to do a bit of auntie dancing to pull them off. Whatever it takes to get it across the line.\n\"Who would have thought as a comedian you could get on a baking show. We were rubbing our hands together in glee. We had nothing else on.\"\nWHAT \nThe Great Australian Bake Off\nWHEN \nLifeStyle Food, Tuesday, 8.30pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:40:28.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
