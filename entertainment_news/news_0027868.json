We can obviously see that the songs have two different theme, ours is a gospel song talking about God and they are talking about the wonderful shape of a woman. I am managing an artiste who has that song’s hook and I think it is the hook [Galaxy] used,\" Frank said on Entertainment this Week with MzGee. \nFrank Ankomah who is new to the game of managing artiste faults his medium of promotion for theft, as he claims Galaxy may have received his Papabi track via WhatsApp. \n\"We have promoted this song mainly in Kumasi, some part of the Volta Region and Koforidua [Eastern Region] but a lot more of what we are doing is promotion through social media. We wanted to come out with an album but we decided to push one song out there and make available to everybody so we sent it mostly on WhatsApp so though they might not have used the studio we used, I do not know how they could have gotten the song but per how we promoted the song anything is possible,\" he said. \nIn their response to the accusation, Galaxy – made up of rapper Chicky and singer Kwesi David – who were not amused by the embarrassment the accusation is causing them, denied knowledge of the gospel track Papabi by Nana Ama. \nThey say even if such an artiste or song did exist, the situation can only be a mere coincidence. \nAccording to the musical duo, the inspiration to write the song Papabi came two months ago when a Takoradi-based beat maker by name Willis sent them the beat. \n\"When Willis beat sent us, our personal beat maker Shoto Blinks asked that we do something with it and within two hours the song was ready so we don’t understand him. We think he [Frank] just wants to ride on us to promote his song,\" Galaxy told MzGee in a statement.
