Holly Rubenstein reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nThey're called Bond. James Bond. And, for the first time, all six of them will be displayed together at London's Madame Tussauds. Waxworks of Daniel Craig, Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan are appearing in London for six weeks only before embarking on a world tour. Each figure costs around £150,000 to make but Madame Tussaud's general manager said it's certainly worth it. SOUNDBITE General Manager of Madame Tussauds, Edward Fuller, saying (English): \"Yeah, it's a huge amount of investment and a huge amount of time. I mean it's the quality and the detail that goes into making every single one of these wonderful wax figures, I mean, it's taken about twenty real expert sculptors and teams about four months to put together these six Bonds.\" All the Bonds except Lazenby have previously been made into waxworks. It's a process that requires painstaking detail. (SOUNDBITE) Figure production coordinator and artist at Madame Tussauds, Alex Garnett, saying (English): \"Each hair is inserted one at a time. It's real human hair that we always use.\" The exhibit coincides with the upcoming release of SPECTRE, the latest 007 movie, on October 26.
