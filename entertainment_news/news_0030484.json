Like the two series before it, it’s merciless viewing as psychologists John Aiken and Clare Rowe put the families – the McDonalds, a blended family with four children whose happiness score puts them in the “disatisfaction” camp; the Watsons, a mother and daughter who are rated as “distressed”; and the Camerons, who have three children (four if you count the husband), and are also classified as dissatisfied – through exercises to improve their relationships and communications skills. It can be cringeworthy viewing, as the first episode exposes some truly petulant teenagers and one clueless parent, but as with the previous shows, there is plenty to be learnt, even if you want to give some of them a good talking to.      \nBreaking the Silence, ABC, 9.30pm \nAdvertisement From three families in trouble to one family, the Waks, who have bravely battled their own crisis – their ostracisation from Melbourne’s Orthodox Jewish Habad sect after their son Manny reported that he was sexually abused at the Yeshivah centre while he was in primary school. This documentary follows his testimony in February at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse and the aftermath that followed. While it can be tough viewing, Manny and his father Zephaniah are a smart, charismatic and outspoken pair who have had to rebuild their lives and faith.    \nThe Americans, One, 10.30pm \nThe Americans is not on my regular watch list, so to be dropped into episode two of the second series was satisfyingly tense at best, baffling at worst. However, from what I have gathered, it’s a good idea never to trust your local travel agents as they are probably a pair of embedded KGB spies. That’s right, Flight Centre is a front for the communist revolution. Props though to the make-up department, as Matthew Rhys’ undercover electrician moustache and ponytail work was so good he’d fit right into a Tradies Afloat booze cruise.\nLouise Rugendyke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:32:55.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
