UR President Joel Seligman, who called Lennie his closest academic adviser, made the announcement in an email to the university community on Wednesday.\nLennie also wanted to resign from his position as dean of the faculty of arts, sciences and engineering at the end of the school year, but Seligman convinced him to stay on until June 2017.\nSeligman praised Lennie for substantially strengthening arts, sciences and engineering programs as well as overseeing the expansion of student housing and the renovation of classroom spaces.\nDuring Lennie's tenure, undergraduate applications to UR have risen to almost 17,000 a year and the SAT scores of entering students have increased from the 87th to the 94th percentile.\n\"His achievements have been across the board in data science, optics and engineering, and he provided critical support for the development of our new Humanities Center and the Institute for Performing Arts,\" Seligman said.\nLennie has served as provost since 2012, and in that capacity has supervised university information technology. He has also led efforts to bolster UR's global engagement and energized UR's research programs.\nHe initially served as an associate professor, then full professor of psychology and visual science at UR from 1982 to 1995. At different times, Lennie served as director of UR's Center for Visual Science and dean of academic resources and planning.\nIn 1995, Lennie became the founding chair of Rochester's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.\nFrom 1999 to 2006, Lennie was at New York University as dean for science and professor in neural science. He was responsible for the development of programs and departments in the natural sciences as well as interdisciplinary and interschool initiatives in the sciences.\nLennie returned to UR in 2006 to become dean of faculty of arts, science and engineering.\nHis research has examined how the brain's visual cortex processes information about the form and color of objects. Author of more than 80 publications, Lennie is an elected fellow of the Optical Society of America and has twice received a Merit Award from the National Eye Institute.\nLennie earned a bachelor of science degree in psychology in 1969 from the University of Hull, in England. He earned his doctoral degree in experimental psychology from the University of Cambridge in 1972.\nJGOODMAN@Gannett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:20:05.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
