A belt in the middle is mixed. And across the south, it's overwhelmingly red. But this isn't politics mapped. It's baseball.\nThough Chicago is home to two teams, the Cubs and the Cardinals dominate the state. A look at Facebook user data showed the divide. But it also revealed pockets of fans in other parts of the Midwest.\nThe Cubs, for instance, have a strong following in eastern Iowa. A dark blue color, dense with Cubs fans, stretches west from the Illinois border. There it fades into a lighter hue, with a few counties which slightly favor the Kansas City Royals or Minnesota Twins. But they're outliers.\nTake Johnson County, Iowa, for example, where Dan Allen is from, and where, based on \"likes,\" more than a third of Facebook-using baseball fans root for the Cubs.\n\"There's a lot of Cards fans, but I still feel like the Cubs dominate them,\" Allen said. The 38-year-old drove four hours from Iowa City on Wednesday night to be at the Cubby Bear, a bar in Wrigleyville, where he watched his favorite team win the wild-card game on TV.\n\"This is electric,\" he said of the atmosphere. \"It's incredible.\"\nDepending on where a baseball fan lives in Illinois, the favored team could the Chicago Cubs, the St. Louis Cardinals or both.\nThe Cubs travel to St. Louis to face the Cardinals on Friday in Game 1 of the National League Division Series.\nAllen's tie to the team is a generational one. He was born in Chicago, and though he moved when he was 12, \"my mom was born a block from Wrigley Field. My grandfather tried out for the Cubs. All of my family seems to root for them.\"\nAnother reason Iowans may root for the Cubs is the team has a minor league affiliate there, said Cassidy Lent, reference librarian for the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\"A minor league team is going to draw in fans for their major league team, or at least that's the hope,\" Lent said.\nThe Triple-A Iowa Cubs play in Des Moines. On Wednesday, the team opened up its ballpark so Chicago Cubs fans could watch the Pittsburgh game under the lights and on the video board. The Cubs' Single-A team in South Bend, Ind., did the same.\nOutside of Illinois, Iowa and Indiana, a few hot spots exist. There's one in South Dakota. In Nebraska, a handful of counties light up. One of them is Stanton County, home of Stanton, a city of less than 2,000 people, where Kyle Voecks serves as mayor.\nStarting Friday, Cubs-Cardinals rivalry takes a profound shift Will Leitch The Cubs-Cardinals rivalry, as Buzz Bissinger once put it, is about \"geography and territorial rights.\" If you go under the notion that the percentage of Cardinals fans in Chicago is essentially zero (if not exactly zero), you can theoretically drive south on Interstate 55 and watch that percentage...\nThe Cubs-Cardinals rivalry, as Buzz Bissinger once put it, is about \"geography and territorial rights.\" If you go under the notion that the percentage of Cardinals fans in Chicago is essentially zero (if not exactly zero), you can theoretically drive south on Interstate 55 and watch that percentage...\n(Will Leitch) There, nearly a fifth of Facebook-using fans root for them, the city's most popular team. And it didn't surprise Voecks.\n\"I know there's a lot,\" he said. \"You see the flags, banners waving. They're the only thing you hear on the radio in the area, so people started following the Cubs years ago and it kind of hung in there.\"\nFor St. Louis, the spread is more vast. The city is the epicenter for Cardinals fans who \"like\" the team on Facebook, but the team's reach can be seen in southern Illinois and Indiana, western Kentucky and Tennessee, northeastern Oklahoma, northwestern Mississippi and almost all of Arkansas.\nTake Pocahontas, Ark., for example, where Bill Endicott helps run a series of sister radio stations. One of them is KPOC-FM 104.1, which broadcasts Cardinals games to the city and surrounding Randolph County.\nHe cited the broadcasts — which date back several decades — and a history of St. Louis scouts fishing for players in the area as the reason nearly 70 percent of Facebook-using fans follow the team.\n\"It all combines together to make Pocahontas be a more rabid Cardinal fan area, but we have a lot of Cubs fans here too,\" he said. \"I know at the churches sometimes, they'll say, 'Well, we're gonna have a shorter service today because the first pitch is at 12:30.' That's a typical preacher around here.\"\nEndicott said the Cardinals' oldest living fan, Marie Davis, also lives in Pocahontas. The team recently recognized the 108-year-old.\n\"She's someone who still faithfully listens to the games,\" he said.\nFarther south in Arkansas, in Jonesboro, sports radio host Brad Bobo wasn't surprised nearly 60 percent of Facebook-using baseball fans in the overlying Craighead County root for the Cardinals.\n\"We go over Cardinals highlights every day on my show,\" he said. \"They are just like a local team.\"\nHe said the Cardinals even have even more of a following than the city's Arkansas State University, since Jonesboro sees a split between those fans and those who root for University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.\n\"You'll get some Cubs fans here, or Braves fans here, but it's such a minority,\" he said.\nEven former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee went on St. Louis' KMOX station Thursday and said he grew up listening to the Cardinals on the radio, took his children to the games on their birthdays and gave a big \"Go Cards!\"\nOriginal radio broadcasts breed fans, no matter the proximity, and family ties tend to keep those alive, said Lent, the Baseball Hall of Fame librarian.\n\"Take, for example, a state like Connecticut, where they have no team,\" she said. \"You find a split pretty much between the middle of the state with the western half being Yankee fans while the eastern half is Boston. That's because of radio and TV broadcasts, and the same is (true) for St. Louis.\"\nAside from hot spots, clusters of Cubs fans can be found around the country. Maybe it's a family. Maybe it's a few transplants. But the team's reach isn't limited to America.\nBefore the wild-card win, longtime Cubs fan and U.S. ambassador to the nation of Georgia, Ian Kelly, woke up at 4 a.m. with his wife, Francesca, to watch the game in their family room across the globe. She said many servicemen and servicewomen caught the Cubs win at odd hours too.\n\"It was well worth losing a few hours' sleep,\" she said.\nrcrosby@tribpub.com\nTwitter @rachelacrosby\nPrivacy Policy Iowa Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs Baseball Minnesota Twins National League Atlanta Braves", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56170c72/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-nation-met-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56170d96/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-fan-photos-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616dee7/turbine/ct-spt-1009-leitch-cardinals-cubs-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56167355/turbine/chi-cubs-cardinals-ct0031559896-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56167404/turbine/chi-cubs-cardinals-ct0031559855-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:10:21.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
