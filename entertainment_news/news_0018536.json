Shonda Rhimes' Shondaland is developing a TV series which picks up after the tragic ending in Shakespeare's work. \"Still Star-Crossed\", a 2013 YA book by Melinda Taub, is going to be the basis for the ABC series. The love story follows the continuing conflict between the Capulets and the Montagues in the wake of Romeo and Juliet's deaths. Prince Escalus concludes that in order to create peace the two families must marry. According to the book's synopsis, Romeo's best friend and Montague bachelor Benvolio is chosen to tie the knot with Capulet maid Rosaline who is none other than Juliet's older cousin and Romeo's first love. Contrary to their late cousins, there's no love lost between Benvolio and Rosaline. Betsy Beers is producing with Rhimes. \" Grey's Anatomy \" scribe Heather Mitchell will serve as both writer and executive producer. It would be a whole new territory for the team which has been handling mature relationships on such series as \" Scandal \", \" Private Practice \" and \" How to Get Away with Murder \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:46:01.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
