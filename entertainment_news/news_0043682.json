Awkward much? Che has just got through but Sean's pic is up? Weird that Sean is then 3rd picked? #xfactor #blunder pic.twitter.com/CmE1LB4OcH \n— ML Hudson (@ml_hudson) October 25, 2015 Awkward moment when Che's name was announced and they put a photo of Sean on the screens before he was even through… #XFactor \n— Angharad Yronwy (@Gingereed) October 25, 2015 \nNick’s final choice was Seann Miley Moore who promised us more heels and broken nails. Seann Miley Moore (Syco / ITV) \nFans were mostly happy. \n— Jessie Booth (@JessieBooth_1) October 25, 2015 #xfactor @Sean Miley Moore has to win xfactor! \n— Jo Marle de Cera (@JEMDC) October 25, 2015 I'm just glad Sean got through tbh #XFactor \nAlthough, people can’t help but wonder heels played a part in his success. Sean only got through because he's a guy in heels. #XFactor #Controversial \n— Laura Davison (@LauraaDavisonn) October 25, 2015 \nHowever, a lot of people were kind of hoping Josh Daniel would be in the final three.
