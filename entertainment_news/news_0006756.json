He slid from side to side to create a throwing lane and on occasion he backed up to create the time necessary as the Bears hung around just long enough to rally for an 18-17 victory in the final minute Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium.\nUnder pressure, Cutler completed 10 of 19 passes for 133 yards and two touchdowns. He pulled the ball down and ran twice for 12 yards, gaining a first down on third-and-3 from the Bears' 19-yard line while taking a solid hit from linebacker Derrick Johnson at the end of a 5-yard gain. He was sacked twice, including the lost fumble linebacker Ramik Wilson recovered for a touchdown. In all, Cutler was pressured on 23 of his 49 dropbacks but proved to be savvy in the pocket with rookie center Hroniss Grasu making his first start and Charles Leno subbing for Jermon Bushrod at left tackle.\nCutler climbed the pocket to deliver a 33-yard strike to Marquess Wilson as Leno ran Tamba Hali past the play in the third quarter to set up Robbie Gould's second field goal. He completed passes for gains of 18 and 20 yards to Cameron Meredith under duress. On the first one, he backpedaled to avoid a diving Justin Houston and then stepped up to elude Jaye Howard while keeping his eyes downfield. Johnson had a free rush and Cutler hung in long enough to allow Wilson to break off his corner route for a 22-yard touchdown. A slow start turned into a magnificent finish.\nQuarterback grade: 9\nOffensive line\nGrade: 6\nRight tackle Kyle Long stymied the talented Houston, solo blocking him for much of the game, and that really stood out. Houston was credited with only two tackles. Leno was solid again in pass sets but still needs to improve in the run game. While Grasu needed to be more stout on the sack-strip for a touchdown, the play initially broke down when right guard Vladimir Ducasse did little to impede Howard. Left guard Matt Slauson showed some athletic ability in the open field while blocking on Matt Forte's 18-yard screen on a third-and-18.\nRunning backs\nGrade: 6\nThere were not a lot of gaping holes and the play-calling got out of balance with the double-digit deficit in the second half. Forte made a nice grab for the game-winning touchdown.\nWide receivers\nGrade: 7\nWilson made a strong showing for a second straight game and delivered in the clutch. Defenders struggle with Wilson's length. It looked like the pass-interference penalty on Marcus Peters defending Wilson might have been a makeup for a missed call on Sean Smith on the previous snap. Meredith showed excellent hands to snatch a low throw and is earning Cutler's trust.\nTight ends\nGrade: 4\nMartellus Bennett was targeted a team-high 11 times but produced only four receptions for 32 yards. Credit the Chiefs with doing a nice job using a variety of defenders on him. Though he often wins one-on-one matchups, that wasn't the case here. Safety Tyvon Branch disrupted a nice throw just enough on a shot down the middle of the field late in the fourth quarter.\nDefensive line\nGrade: 6\nIt was interesting but not surprising that with the introduction of Jeremiah Ratliff to the rotation Jarvis Jenkins led all linemen with 47 snaps. Ratliff had 37 and rookie Eddie Goldman, who was stout in the middle again, logged 33. Jamaal Charles did most of his damage on the perimeter. The Chiefs made a point to block Jenkins.\nLinebackers\nGrade: 7\nSam Acho's 35 snaps were the second most for outside linebackers and he made good use of his time with eight tackles. He was solid in coverage too. Pernell McPhee was right to talk about being targeted by the Chiefs in the running game and he didn't have his best game. Christian Jones improved with eight tackles and Shea McClellin was playing well before his knee injury. Willie Young had a sack and another strong rush.\nCornerbacks\nGrade: 7\nTracy Porter made an aggressive inside move to break up a third-down throw by Alex Smith when the Chiefs were working to run out the clock. He also made a clear error when he broke inside in an effort to tackle De'Anthony Thomas on his 19-yard touchdown. The right play was to go the other direction and force him back to help. Kyle Fuller did well defending tight end Travis Kelce on a fade in the end zone.\nSafeties\nGrade: 6\nRookies Adrian Amos and Harold Jones-Quartey teamed up to be assignment sound. Jones-Quartey was in control when he came down to tackle Kelce after a 4-yard gain.\nSpecial teams\nGrade: 8\nThe Chiefs didn't have any big profits in the return game so it looks like Jeff Rodgers' unit is starting to tighten things up in coverage. McPhee's blocked field goal when the Chiefs' Donald Stephenson fell over loomed large in the fourth quarter.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\nPrivacy Policy Copyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Jay Cutler Kansas City Chiefs Chicago Bears Hroniss Grasu Jaye Howard Matt Forte Tamba Hali", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c453a/turbine/ct-film-session-biggs-bears-spt-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:13:53.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
