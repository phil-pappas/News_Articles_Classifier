In Shatner's World, the TV and stage veteran does occasionally come across as having an ego the size of a planet but circumnavigating his universe is a fun, engrossing journey. \nThe show is a comic look at his life, told at breakneck speed from his origins in Montreal, covering his acting work, family life and his career in spoken-word recordings. \nAnd it is very funny. Shatner is a surprising comic force, displaying a sharp wit, a hefty serve of self-deprecation and pinpoint accuracy in timing. \nHe's impossibly spritely and animated for an 84-year-old, carrying the two-hour show without a glitch, deftly switching tone and tempo to keep proceedings lively. It's theatre and he's a compelling showman, all right. \nThe show is a carefully crafted, dense affair, with anecdotes broken up with video clips or photographs. A chair he sporadically uses also doubles as a prop, at one point he dramatically raises it above his head to mimic a rearing horse. \nThere are poignant and insightful glimpses into his world, particularly when he talks about his parents and three daughters; for example, he proudly and touchingly demonstrates how to fold a jacket for travelling, a skill taught to him by his father, a clothing manufacturer. \nThere are some odd moments, too. A story about his beloved horse, the American saddlebreed Sultan's Great Day, is long and unwieldy. At another point he almost implies he was a major contributing factor to the 1969 moon landing. And why no mention of his hit 1980s cop show TJ Hooker? \nStar Trek does not take up as much of the show as diehard Trekkies might like, but the spotlight here is on Shatner's entire life, not just his mere three years as Captain James T Kirk.\nIn a clip from an interview with Patrick Stewart, he's clearly impacted by Stewart's acceptance that despite the body of work behind him, he'll be first and foremost remembered as Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Shatner responds that Stewart's grace has made him, too, accept the overwhelming association with Captain Kirk.  \nHowever, Shatner's World reveals a world beyond Star Trek  and one inhabited by a passionate performer, raconteur and wordsmith, and it's an enlightening display of the beloved actor. \nAt one point, he refers to himself as a relic – that seems a touch harsh. A treasure is a fairer assessment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:40.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
