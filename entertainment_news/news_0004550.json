All of what followed in pop music, Checker seems ready to argue. \n\"It's like the light bulb,\" he says. \"Who thinks of Thomas Edison and the light bulb? Why? We use it so much we don't think about him. Alexander Graham Bell? I'm on the telephone, I'm not thinking about him. When it comes to the music industry, we didn't know that [Chubby Checker] would change the music industry like this.\" \nChecker, backed by a five-piece band, will be appearing at Morristown's Mayo Center with The Spinners (\"Working My Way Back to You,\" \"I'll Be Around\"), who – it was just announced – have been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \nRock-and-roll's \"official\" gatekeepers have not yet seen fit to honor Checker in this way. Nor, he says, is he looking for such an accolade. A simple statue of himself, in front of the hall's headquarters in Cleveland, would be sufficient. \n\"To put a symbol of Chubby Checker in the courtyard, inviting everybody in to rock-and-roll – who's more fit to do that?\" he asks. \"It's not a power play. Every rock-and-roll person in there who has a song with a beat, Chubby Checker helps them make money.\" \nChecker – who tends to refer to himself in the third person when he speaks – would appear to belong to a great tradition of braggadocio artists, whose ranks include Ferdinand \"Jelly Roll\" Morton (\"I invented jazz in 1902\") and the late Bo Diddley, who claimed to have invented both rock-and-roll and rap. \"It had to be somebody first, and it was me,\" Diddley told The Record in 2004. \nYet such people often have a real basis for their extravagant claims – extravagant, partly because they feel the need to make up for the recognition shortfall. \"It's very unfair, what's happening to me in the music industry,\" Checker says. \"Am I being recognized? No, I'm not.\" \nThat hasn't stopped Checker, a very vigorous 74, from remaining active in the music scene for more than five decades. He charted with versions of the Beatles' \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" in 1969, and \"Running\" in 1982, and recently had a ballad, \"Changes\" (2013), hitting No. 43 (adult contemporary) and No. 31 (gospel) on the Mediabase Top 100 charts. Folks who come to his show at Mayo expecting to see a '60s relic will be disappointed, he says. \n\"I'm a rock performer,\" he says. \"If you're coming to see an old man beaten up, stay home – you're not going to see that. I am an old man, but I sure kick some good butt, boy. You're looking at a 1960 Corvette with a 1968 engine, a 427, and 450 horsepower. We kick butt all day long. I'm coming to Morristown, I'm bringing the fire, we're gonna burn the theater down and go home … Anybody who misses my performance, I feel sorry for them.\" \nIt's in rock histories that Checker, born Ernest Evans in South Carolina, tends to be shortchanged. \nPerhaps it's because people see something derivative in both his stage name, Chubby Checker (quite obviously a play on Fats Domino) and his big song, \"The Twist\" (a cover of a song originally recorded by Hank Ballard & the Midnighters in 1959). \nOr perhaps it's because of the way rock historians often dismiss the whole early 1960s Philadelphia pop scene from which Checker emerged — along with Fabian, Frankie Avalon and Bobby Rydell — as a kind of slick commercial interlude between the golden age of Elvis, Chuck Berry and Little Richard and the silver age that began in 1964 with the Beatles' arrival in America. \nChecker has a different view. \n\"The Beatles came, and they were wonderful,\" he says. \"But did they change anything? And Elvis, did he change anything? Elvis was great, but rock-and-roll was here before Elvis was here. Did he change the music industry forever? Did Buddy Holly change the music industry forever? Did the Beach Boys change the music industry forever? Chubby Checker changed the music industry. People don't want to deal with that. But Chubby Checker changed the dance floor.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:56:21.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
