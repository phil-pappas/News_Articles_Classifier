Like Charles Darwin, Alexander Graham Bell, Charles Dickens, and Florence Nightingale.\nThe latest trailer shows off these historical figures as they're out for blood to take back London from the Templars. Though players will step into the shoes of twins Jacob and Evie Frye (male and female playable characters), characters like Karl Marx are aiding them behind the scenes. These inventors, novelists, and other storied individuals want to help the Frye siblings take back the city from the underworld, and to be frank it sounds totally awesome.\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate is releasing October 23, 2015 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and November 19, 2015 for PC.", "external_links": ["http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-us/home/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/08yEh3r35II"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:33:29.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
