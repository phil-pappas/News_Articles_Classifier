We have a prayer every night before the show and then we do like a chant, a group chant.\" \nJustin's holiday with Jade hit headlines following the publication of pictures which showed him walking around outside his villa naked, and the pop star recently revealed he felt \"super violated\" after the snaps appeared online. \n\"My first thing was like... how can they do this? Like, I feel super violated,\" he told U.S. TV show Access Hollywood. \"Like, I feel like I can't step outside and feel like I can go outside naked. Like, you should feel comfortable in your own space... especially that far away.\" \nJustin is preparing to launch his new album, Purpose, next month (Nov15) and is hoping to capitalise on the huge success of his last single What Do You Mean?, which gave him his first number one in both the U.S. and U.K. \nThe record is due for release Nov. 13, the same day his rivals One Direction unveil their latest album, \"Made in the A.M.,\" sparking a pop chart war.
