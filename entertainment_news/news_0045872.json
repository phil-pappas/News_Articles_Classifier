Newslook\nSelena Gomez (Photo: Samir Hussein, WireImage)\n86 CONNECT 54 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Selena Gomez is finally ready to talk about her health.\nThe singer, whose brief stint in rehab in early 2014 spawned rumors of substance abuse and relationship troubles, told Billboard that the real reason she took a break was because she was diagnosed with Lupus. She told the magazine:\n“I was diagnosed with Lupus, and I’ve been through chemotherapy. That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke. I wanted so badly to say, ‘You guys have no idea. I’m in chemotherapy. You’re assholes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.”\nUSA TODAY\nSelena Gomez stages musical, personal 'Revival'\nBeing splashed across the tabloids has been frustrated, she said:\n\"I'm so (expletive) nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me. I’ve been working since I was 7. I’ve been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17. It’s so disappointing that I’ve become a tabloid story.\"\nGomez told USA TODAY earlier this month that despite the hate, her fans keep her motivated:\n\"Not to sound cheesy. Literally, I feel like this industry has the ability to make you really hate people. Just the people I have come into contact with in the press and stuff like that, it's really disappointing to see what society and fame has become. But my heart hasn't changed. I care about people. I would love to go to dinner with everybody and just hang out and talk, and I love my fans. My fans are the only thing that's been consistent in my life.\"\n86 CONNECT 54 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT //usat.ly/1RvGSn1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1RvGSn1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6a7e701fb3f920a030046baecbc319b8ad1f7a88/c=0-0-1787-1344&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798924525077132-GTY-489352492.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3fbfccd4032d54cb0c323ca0905bb6bf7393849e/c=867-1066-2772-2971/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793084878872229-05-SG-Interscope-01204-v02.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RvHIAj", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4541349787001_thumb-newslook894045.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RvGSn1&mini=true", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6721973/selena-gomez-billboard-cover-sneak-peek?utm_source=twitter", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RvGSn1&text=Selena%20Gomez%20reveals%20she%20has%20Lupus%2C%20underwent%20chemo&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4541349787001_thumb-newslook894045.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4541349787001_thumb-newslook894045.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798924525077132-GTY-489352492.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90810a3fea411feceb370faf7179df223c735ff9/r=303x400/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798924525077132-GTY-489352492.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:37:06.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
