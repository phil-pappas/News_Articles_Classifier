Russell weighed in on Jennifer Lawrence 's essay about gender-based wage gap in Hollywood. \"I always support all my actors and all their opinions, and I want them all to get what they need,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter at a fundraiser dinner for The Glenholme School held at NYC's Bryant Park Grillon Wednesday, October 21. However, the 40-year-old director admitted he didn't usually talk about the financial matters. \"I don't really talk about the minutia of what goes on in my movies, but I believe the spirit of what Jennifer is saying is truthful to her heart. I support her and all women in that,\" he said. Russell admitted that it would be difficult to negotiate salaries in a movie starring a lot of renowned actors and actresses. \"I understand what she's saying, and I think people in the business do too, and I also understand people saying, 'Well, let's talk about the minutia of the deal.' It's hard to make a movie come together with a lot of big stars,\" he explained. \" 'American Hustle' had a lot of big stars in it. We all contributed to help make it happen.\" \"But I also respect that Jennifer is finding her voice, and I think it's in service of something very important,\" Russell, who has worked with the actress in \" Silver Linings Playbook \", \"American Hustle\" and the upcoming film \" Joy \", added. \"Jennifer's character in 'Joy' is about the same thing: maturity, learning what it is to have your own space and express your own voice and to have power. And that's what she's learning.\" Jennifer's co-star in \"American Hustle\", Bradley Cooper , previously responded positively to her essay. He said he had begun teaming up with female co-stars to negotiate salaries before any film he's interested in working on goes into production. Meanwhile, Jeremy Renner who co-starred in the same movie refused to get involved in such matter as saying, \"That's not my job.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:57.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
