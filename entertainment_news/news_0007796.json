The demand for rubber machinery is closely related to the investments in the downstream tyre industry.\n\nThe high-speed growth rate of Chinese rubber machinery industry in 2013 lasted till the first half year of 2014, during when the orders expanded and production and sales boomed. Then in July 2014 , the United States staged anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations on China -made tyres used for passenger cars and light trucks, and Chinese tyre enterprises were forced to stop or reduce investments in tyre business, and even some tyre enterprises postponed or cancelled rubber machinery orders. At length, the revenue of Chinese rubber machinery industry in full year of 2014 just rose 4.6% YoY to RMB13.6 billion , with a global market share of 42.6%.\n\nIn future, as the growth rate of China's new vehicle sales volume slows down, the demand for original tyres will see a drop in growth rate, while the huge ownership of automobiles will boosted the demand for replacement tyres. At the same time, such trends in tyre industry as informatization, automation, intelligentization, greening, and high-end (less noise, low rolling resistance, low thermogenesis, run-on-flat, all-weather and tyre pressure self-control, as well as applications of new nano materials and framework materials) will stimulate the demand for the high-end safe and green tyres with high added value, thus further driving capital inrush into high-end tyre. In the future, the demand for the high-end rubber machinery in line with the development tendencies of tyre industry such as energy saving, environmental friendliness, automation, informatization and high intelligence will show rapid growth. \n\nMeanwhile, robots are increasingly utilized in tyre production, logistic automation, etc. In 2010, Mesnac Co., Ltd acquired Qingdao Kingerobot Automation Co., Ltd and set foot in the robot field. In 2014, Mesnac's robot and information logistic business revenue surged by 129.7% YoY to RMB193.75 million , a 6.8% share of total revenue. Greatoo Inc. also endeavored to involve in robot business, and in December 2014 the first industrial robot automation line customized by Greatoo for Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., Ltd was officially put into operation. From 2013 to 2015H1, the robot business revenue of Greatoo reported RMB450,000 , RMB6.22 million and RMB25.29 million , respectively.\n\nThe report highlights the followings: \nOverview of rubber machinery industry, including definition, policies, industrial chain, business model, etc.;\nGlobal rubber machinery and downstream markets, covering market size, regional markets, competitive landscape, tyre industry operation, etc.;\nChinese rubber machinery market, including status quo, market size, competition pattern, exports, downstream sectors, etc.;\nRubber machinery market segments consisting of internal mixer, radial tyre building machine, and vulcanizing machine, involving industry overview, market status quo, market demand, etc.;\nAnalysis on 8 global and 18 Chinese rubber machinery companies, including profile, business performance, revenue structure, gross margin, R&D expenses, top five customers, rubber machinery business, development strategies and so forth.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p02446763-summary/view-report.html \n\nAbout Reportlinker \nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
