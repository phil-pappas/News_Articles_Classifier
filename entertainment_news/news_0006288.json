Watch the @Daredevil #NYCC sizzle... Season 2 looks epic! http://t.co/Ce7EJjhZkT https://t.co/Ak03ebZIJq â€” App Store (@AppStore) October 12, 2015 \nThe stars were joined on stage by new showrunners Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez, who admitted that the enthusiastic fan response for \"Daredevil\" season one helped reassure them that there was an appetite for \"dark, gritty, sophisticated content.\" They'll push the envelope even further in season two -- \"you wanted grounded, you wanted dark, here's Elektra, here's Punisher,\" Ramirez laughed. \n\"We love two things: one of them is Matt Murdock, and the other is the world that Matt Murdock navigates,\"Petrie added. \"Last year, Steven [DeKnight] and Drew [Goddard] did a great job of introducing that world... This year, we get to test that world, take it further, [make it] darker, more emotional.\" \nYung, who is a black belt in karate and has previous martial arts experience, admitted that getting to play Elektra is \"intense; exciting; I can't be more happy.\" \nBernthal is already feeling the pressure of living up to his own iconic character. \"I know how important this character is to you guys, and how important this show is to you guys,\" he noted. \"I look at this as a huge honor, a huge responsibility... I'm gonna give everything that I have.\" \nThe cast of \"Jessica Jones\" then hit the stage, and Loeb surprised the fans with a world premiere screening of the first episode in its entirety. Before that, he finally revealed who Carrie Ann Moss is playing: Jeryn Hogarth, a high-powered lawyer in the Marvel universe who is also known to have served as the attorney for Wendell Rand, father of Danny Rand (aka Iron Fist) in the comics -- giving her ties to the fourth Marvel/Netflix series, which will center around Iron Fist. \n\"Jessica Jones\" also features the star of Marvel and Netflix's other upcoming series, Luke Cage (Mike Colter), since Loeb insisted, \"there was no way to tell the story of Jessica Jones without telling a little bit of the story of the man she someday falls in love with.\" \nColter revealed that they're already hard at work on \"Luke Cage,\" which will be \"a different world than Jessica's world,\" but that he's enjoying getting the chance to be part of Jessica's story as well as his own. \n\"Jessica Jones\" showrunner Melissa Rosenberg said that she and Loeb have been discussing the series for a long time, so it was amazing to finally be out in front of fans with the show. \"It's been a long haul and an extraordinary payoff.\" \nSeason one of \"Marvel's Jessica Jones\" will debut on Netflix on Nov. 20. \"Marvel's Daredevil\" returns to Netflix in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:31:56.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
