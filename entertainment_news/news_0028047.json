The movie will be based on a book by Delaware author Charles Brandt. (Photo: Douglas Gorenstein/NBC) \nIt’s been seven years since former Delaware deputy attorney general Charles Brandt saw his name splashed on cover of Variety magazine. \nThe article revealed for the first time that his book about the Mafia and Jimmy Hoffa was set to become a feature film with a line-up of talent that would leave fan of “Goodfellas” or \"The Godfather\" downright giddy: Martin Scorsese as director with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel all rumored to co-star. \nJust think about it. The movie would be De Niro’s first film with Scorsese since 1995’s \"Casino\" and could put De Niro and Pacino face-to-face on film just like they did for the first time in 1995's \"Heat.\" \nSince the film's 2008 announcement, the project has been teased plenty in the press, but the Hollywood heavyweights have not yet started production. \nTentatively entitled \"The Irishman\" and based on Brandt's 2005 book \"I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa,\" the film recently got a high-profile boost on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\" \n\"The Irishman\" was the nickname of Sheeran, a Pennsylvania labor boss who confessed to Brandt that he killed Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003 at 83. \nWhile promoting another film, De Niro discussed \"The Irishman\" with Fallon , who literally bounced in his seat as the two talked about the upcoming mob movie. \nDelaware author Charles Brandt's book \"I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa\" was released in 2005. (Photo: Steer Forth press) \n\"I'm already standing in line,\" Fallon gushed. \nFor Brandt, the \"Tonight Show\" moment and other recent mentions of the film by De Niro in interviews is a signal that his wait \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" on the big screen is winding down. \n\"It was a thrill to see that on 'The Tonight Show.' It finally gave us hope that this is for real,\" says Brandt, 73, who splits time between homes in Lewes and Idaho. \nThroughout the past seven years, tidbits of progress have surfaced in the press about the film. As the author of the original work, he does not receive inside information from Paramount Pictures, which is developing the movie. \n\"So I read the tea leaves like everyone else,\" Brandt says. \nHere's a rundown of the film's achingly slow progress over the past several years: \n-- In 2009 Brandt had a four-hour meeting with Scorsese, De Niro and screenwriter Steve Zaillian in New York to give them more material. \n-- In 2012 film producer Jane Rosenthal, a close De Niro collaborator who co-founded the Tribeca Productions film company and the Tribeca Film Festival with him, told The Hollywood Reporter she considered \"The Irishman\" to be a dream project. \"It would be so great to reunite Marty and Bob after all this time. I would be good if I make no other movie after that,\" she said. 'Star Wars' parody in Wilmington preps fans for movie \n-- In 2013 the New York Post reported that Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and others gathered at the Tribeca Film Center in Manhattan for a read through. The Post added that the film \"may be ready to go soon.\" \nWith all public evidence these days pointing to \"The Irishman\" becoming a reality, Brandt's wait just might be coming to a close. \nAnd the timing couldn't be better. \n\"They've fitted me for a straitjacket so I can't harm anyone else,\" he jokes. \"I can't say you ever get used to the waiting, but it's out of my hands.\" \nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.
