The video shows the process of aluminum alloy ingots used to cast the base of each item. Swiss Diamond uses robotics to evenly coat each aluminum base with a layer of Plasma coating that seals the aluminum from contact with the food and prevents corrosion. The Plasma coating is using a torch with 20,000°C precise flame that infuses a metal powder blend in the interior of each pan. Watch as powdered diamond particles are mixed into coating formulations to reinforce the nonstick properties with their durability, natural nonstick qualities, and heat conductivity. A few samples of each production run are rigorously tested with a sandpaper test of over 8,000 strokes. Every last detail, even the bottom of the pan, is given the utmost attention. Small logos are stamped into the handles to complete the top-of-the-line cookware. With a combination of robotics and the personal touch of employees, every fry pan is created with precision and accuracy.\nSwiss Diamond fry pans are a kitchen necessity.
