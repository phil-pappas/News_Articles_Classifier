Photo: Kate Ryan \nThree months ago, one of the producers of the romantic comedy UnIndian received an offer from a representative of what he described as the biggest DVD chain in the Middle East/India.\nAdvertisement \"Very exciting to know about your film with Mr Brett Lee,\" the email ran. \"If interested we can make an offer to you very, very secretly and personally.\"\nThe company wanted a single copy of the DVD with no marks or identifying signs in exchange for an under-the-table $US300,000 (more than $400,000).\n\"We, sir, will transfer the money as you wish and before handing [over] the DVD ... money will be given as you want … cash, internet, Pay Pal … no problem.\"\nThe pirate promised to only distribute the film internationally after UnIndian 's Australian release.\nThe drawcard was Lee, the former international cricketer who stars opposite Tannishtha Chatterjee.\nDirector Anupam Sharma, who asked at the time that Short Cuts not write about the email until UnIndian had opened, says he was not surprised by the offer given what he knows about Middle Eastern piracy and corruption in the Bollywood film industry.\n\"In the Indian movie market, it's peanuts,\" he says. \"You look at how many Indian spice shops around the world sell DVDs for a dollar, which all come out of the Middle East.\n\"You look at number of cable TV operators in India who put on a film a day after its release in theatres but never get caught. It's a numbers game in India.\"\nWhile viewers may pay just 10 cents to watch a cable channel, there are potentially 100 million subscribers.\nSharma says Bollywood films regularly involve inflated invoices in return for under-the-table payments as they are shot.\n\"You have a standard 15 per cent on everything, from catering to buses to crews to extras,\" he says. \"I've witnessed this corruption and that's one of the reasons I'm in Australia and not back in India.\"\nWhile UnIndian had a soft opening on the weekend, taking $107,000 in 65 cinemas, Sharma remains hopeful for international sales especially in India, where films sell to multiple language audiences.\nHe is also producing the next project from the Australia India Film Fund – Vikram Singh's  An Indian Summer , a drama about a young Australian boy who befriends a school watchman when his family moves to India.\nStar Wars tickets roar along As the midnight sessions sell out for the new Star Wars movie in two months, Australian cinemas have started adding 3am screenings.\nWith a new trailer and poster building the hype around The Force Awakens , the stunning advance sales – more than $1 million in four hours on Tuesday – have continued.\nEvent Cinemas sold 30,000 tickets in three hours – more than the chain's entire pre-sales for any other movie. Within 24 hours, it had sold 60,000.\nA spokesman says 31 per cent of those sales were for midnight sessions, which led to Adelaide's Marion cinema adding a 3am session for those apparently too hyped-up to sleep.\nShowing money is no object to hardcore Star Wars fans, 73 per cent of Event's advance sales were for premium cinemas – Vmax and Gold Class sessions.\nAlthough there have been doubts about the popularity of 3D for many Hollywood movies since Avatar , 70 per cent of ticket sales for The Force Awakens have been in that more immersive format.\nThe movie has also been selling strongly in the US. According to The Hollywood Reporter , the first-day record for sales on the Fandango booking site was held by The Hunger Games until The Force Awakens sold eight times that number.\nHugo is boss It's quite a time for Hugo Weaving.\nIn The Dressmaker , which opens next week, the  Matrix  and  Lord of the Rings  star  has an eye-catching role as a country cop with an eye for fine fabrics.\nHe has also joined the cast of Jasper Jones , Rachel Perkins' coming-of-age film which starts shooting in Western Australia next week.\nLevi Miller from Pan and Blue Dog plays the title role, alongside Toni Collette, Matt Nable​, Dan Wyllie, Susan Prior, Myles Pollard and Angourie Rice.\nAnd now Weaving has been cast in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge , which is shooting in Bringelly in western Sydney this week.\nWith Andrew Garfield playing a conscientious objector who becomes a World War II hero, the movie also features Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn​, Teresa Palmer, Rachel Griffiths, Richard Roxburgh, Ryan Corr and Firass Dirani​.\nAnd in a neat overlapping of generations, both Weaving's son Harry Greenwood and Gibson's son Milo have roles.\nOur favourite Martian Ridley Scott's The Martian continues to be easily the most popular movie in Australian cinemas – taking another $3.1 million last weekend to reach a strong $17.8 million after three weekends.\nAnd unless Steven Spielberg's Cold War drama Bridge of Spies opens strongly this week, the space drama could even stay on top of the box office.\nOn a quiet weekend in cinemas, five new releases all had low-key openings: Crimson Peak ($839,000), Legend ($733,000), The Walk ($525,000), the manga Boruto: Naruto The Movie ($209,000) and Australia's UnIndian ($107,000).\nBut showing the strength of niche ethnic audiences in this country this year, the Chinese comedy Goodbye Mr Loser took $345,000 with an impressive average of $31,000 per cinema.\nThe Australian family film Oddball is destined to break $10 million after another $325,000 took it to $9.7 million.\nBubby's new life At a special screening of Bad Boy Bubby at the Adelaide Film Festival, director Rolf de Heer revealed the film is getting a surprising new life.\nHaving asked to see some the Australian director's previous films, the French distributor of Charlie's Country was particularly struck by his wild 1993 release that had Nicholas Hope as a man-child who grew up in a dingy room with his sexually abusive mother.\nJust back from Paris for the first-time screening with binaural sound in Adelaide, de Heer said Bubby was being re-released in 30 French cinemas soon.\nEncore screenings for docos With strong audiences at the the Antenna Documentary Festival showing the popularity of the real-life stories, five films that sold out in Sydney last week are getting another run at Sydney's Verona cinema from Thursday to Sunday.\nOne is the winner of best international documentary at the festival, Ioanis Nuguet's  Spartacus and Cassandra , which tells the story of two Romani children trying to get by on the streets of France.\nKathryn Millard won best Australian documentary for Shock Room , about psychologist Stanley Milgram's​ controversial experiments in the 1960s, with a special mention for Molly Reynolds' Another Country , which has David Gulpilil​ reflecting on his life in the Northern Territory.\nSimon Cunich​ won best Australian short for Maritus , about a garbage collector's search for a new type of spider.\nLove, Noe way It's billed as the year's most controversial cinematic experience. A screening of Love 3D will be followed by a Skype Q&A with the always-provocative director Gaspar Noe ( Irreversible ) at Melbourne's Lido Cinemas on Friday night.\nThe explicit film about a doomed menage a trois has sold out screenings at Melbourne International Film Festival and opened the Sydney Underground Film Festival.\nMore Short Cuts at theage.com.au/entertainment/movies \nMore Short Cuts at smh.com.au/entertainment/movies \nTwitter @gmaddox", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:29:35.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
