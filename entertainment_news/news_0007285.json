Her representative tells People.com, \"She (Hayden) is voluntarily seeking professional help at a treatment center as she is currently battling postpartum depression. She asks that the media respect her privacy during this time.\"\nIronically, the star portrays a new mom with the condition on hit country music TV drama Nashville and she admitted she could relate to the situation as she went public with her own issues. \"It's something a lot of women experience,\" she told morning show Live with Kelly and Michael. \"When (you're told) about postpartum depression you think it's, 'I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child' - I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal.\"\nNews of Hayden's rehab treatment comes after the actress took to social media on Saturday to reveal her joy at beginning to regain her pre-pregnancy figure.
