This Bud's for you, St. Louis.\nBut a little channel surfing is definitely in order, Cubs fans. The Mets need your support! It would be a shame for the Dodgers to crush the Mets' hopes of winning the World Series.\nThat's a job for your Chicago Cubs.\nSo root, root, root for a Cubs-Mets matchup — and not just because, on paper at least, the Mets would be easier to beat. The Cubs are 7-0 against the Mets this year and 3-4 against the Dodgers.\nThat 7-0 doesn't mean the Cubs own the Mets. Nobody owns anyone in baseball. Nobody owns anything at all, as the Cubs and Mets showed in 1969.\nThat was the year a black cat showed up in Shea Stadium during a crucial Mets-Cubs series in September, strolling past the late Cubs third baseman Ron Santo in the on-deck circle before disappearing under the stands. Cue the demons: The teetering Cubs collapsed, and the Mets went on to win the World Series.\nPhoto gallery: The Cubs clinch the NLDS and celebrate with a 6-4 victory over the Cardinals at Wrigley Field.\n(Brian Cassella) For most of that season, the Cubs had seemed destined to end what at the time was a 61-year World Series drought. (Go ahead, laugh.) They hadn't won a pennant since 1945. They still haven't.\nThe Mets, a 1962 expansion team, had finished last in five of their first seven seasons and second-to-last in two.\nThe Cubs sprinted to an early division lead, winning 11 of their first 12 games. They were in first place for 155 days, leading the Mets by a season-high 91/2 games on Aug. 14.\nBackup catcher Gene Oliver pledged to jump off the Hancock tower if the Cubs didn't win the pennant. The Tribune published a column headlined, \"Why All the Fuss? Cubs Can't Lose It.\"\nBut they lost 17 of their last 25 games. The Mets, meanwhile, went on a 23-7 run, finishing eight games ahead of the Cubs.\nRubbing salt in the wound, the Mets took 12 innings and six pitchers to beat the Cubs 6-5 in a meaningless Oct. 1 game before moving on to postseason glory.\n\"I wish we could play over some of those games against the Mets,\" Santo told a Tribune reporter in 1989.\nA Cubs-Mets NLCS is the closest thing to a do-over. Beating the Mets for the pennant is an obvious next step for the 2015 Cubs as they continue to thumb their noses at history.\nThese young Cubs have already clinched a playoff series at home, the first at 101-year-old Wrigley Field. They've shrugged off the billy goat curse. They've eliminated the Cardinals! We imagine them rolling their eyes at the superstitious old people who tell that story about Santo and the black cat.\nNone of these Cubs were born in 1969. Heck, it's possible that some of their parents weren't born. But Cubs fans who lived through that spectacular failure will never forget it.\nWhat could possibly be better than winning the World Series? Bouncing the Mets on the way.\nWe know just the team to do it.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets World Series Ron Santo St. Louis Cardinals National League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561eadf3/turbine/ct-cubs-clinch-nlds-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ed9cc/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-edit-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:15:32.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
