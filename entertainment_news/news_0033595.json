Agents, animators, writers, directors, costume designers, composers, managers, attorneys, sound editors, electricians and others will discuss their jobs and how they got them. \nClips from feature films chosen by the panelists will be shown to illustrate the significance of specific filmmaking skills. \nThe educational summit is being presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Overbrook Entertainment and the Small Business Administration's My Brother's Keeper initiative, which was created by President Barack Obama to engage young people of color educationally and professionally. \n\"It is critical that we continue to build diversity in the on and off-screen workforce,\" summit leader Mike Muse, CEO of Muse Recordings, said in a statement. \"There are young people who have the intuition and drive to succeed but are lacking the tools and knowledge of how to translate their ideas and dreams into viable businesses and opportunities. This summit is set to equip the next generation of entrepreneurs.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:29:28.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
