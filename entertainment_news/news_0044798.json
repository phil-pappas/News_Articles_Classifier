It is a work of fiction.) Seven years ago this May, we were married. My husband is my constant companion And I am lucky to have him. Together we have two beautiful children and a house in town. My husband works while I can take care of the house and family. I am so lucky to have him. I try to keep the children well-behaved so our home is peaceful. My husband likes quiet and order And we are lucky to have him. I keep our little house neat and clean He can’t stand mess and chaos. I am lucky to have him. Sometimes he comes home tired and cranky so I keep the children in their rooms and I fold laundry. He works hard and I am lucky to have him. I used to go out with friends but I haven’t done that in a long time. I don’t really have friends anymore. He is all I need and I am lucky to have him. Sometimes I leave a cupboard door open or forget to buy milk. I’m sure no one else would put up with me. So I am lucky to have him. Thursday is bowling and Friday is bar night. Sometimes he drinks a little too much. He doesn’t mean to hurt me and I am lucky to have him. He leaves me on the floor, Bruised and sobbing and reminds me again How lucky I am to have him.
