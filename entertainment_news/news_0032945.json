Thank you @harmonycolumbus for an amazing experience. #JusticeReformNOW\n— Melissa Etheridge (@metheridge) October 7, 2015 Wearing a black leather jacket, Etheridge, who sang a five songs and spoke encouraging words from a small stage, said she had been moved by a video of women inmates in an addiction-recovery group called Tapestry singing A Little Bit of Me .\nThe video was made because the Harmony Project, a Columbus community choir, has been singing with the group every week for the last several years. Etheridge saw the video during a Women’s Fund of Central Ohio event in May, where she was the featured speaker.\n“You can change the world and I want to inspire you to do that,\" she told the women. \"I want to fill you with that.”\nEtheridge closed her mini-concert with A Little Bit of Me (she had opened with her first hit, Come to My Window) and invited members of the group to come up and sing with her.\nMelissa Etheridge performed before 2,300 inmates at Ohio Reformatory for Women in Marysville, Ohio, on Oct. 7, 2015. (Photo: Jonathan Quilter, AP)\n“When I did the event for the Ohio Women’s Fund, it was such an amazing experience to see women behind bars take a song that talks about the sameness in each of us and sing it at the top of their lungs,” Etheridge said after the concert. “It just warmed my heart; it let me know that there’s a special place here that maybe I can be of more service to someone.”\nLater, she visited the Tapestry inmates' dormitory, where she left her autographed handprints in paint on the wall and encouraged inmates to contact her when they're released. They cheered loudly and sang two songs for her.\n\"It was amazing; she really touched my heart and she really gave me a lot of hope,\" said Georgia Peterman of Portsmouth, who has six months remaining on a three-year sentence for manufacturing methamphetamine. \"I'm really glad I got to be a part of this.\"\nEtheridge told the inmates after the show that she might have to write her next song about them.\nThe Columbus Dispatch posted a video.\nContributing: The Associated Press\n34 CONNECT 29 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/1LklWym TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1LklWym", "http://www.dispatch.com/content/mediaplayer/embed.html?ooid=kxYWszeDplYn1ZWuh8LzE19qhnS19tVG&cmpid=share", "https://twitter.com/metheridge/status/651864424941232128", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LklWym&text=Melissa%20Etheridge%20plays%20Ohio%20women%27s%20prison&via=usatoday", "http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/10/07/etheridge-gives-concert-in-prison.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/JusticeReformNOW?src=hash", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LklWym&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/harmonycolumbus", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799113610949986-AP-Prison-Concert-Melissa-Etheride.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/279a16ae846c1c201a89e14bc3a51132b24e8485/r=500x393/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799113610949986-AP-Prison-Concert-Melissa-Etheride.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b738cc60a53cfd0f0bfc879239e76b9d95b9886/c=0-85-2398-1888&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799113610949986-AP-Prison-Concert-Melissa-Etheride.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/137da978300ec52f93041807b5ad85cdd17ae982/c=21-0-2379-1773&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799117091488297-AP-Prison-Concert-Melissa-Etheride-001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:59:43.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
