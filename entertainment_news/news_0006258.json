Not the website itself.\" \nWhile Brad doesn't condone using the cheating website, he is glad it exists for the purposes of the CMA Awards monologue. He says, \"If anybody has a right to deal with a cheating website, it's us. Don't you think? In country music.\" \nThe current political election will also provide some great comedy bits. \"This election has been just amazing,\" Brad adds. \"They give us sound bites. We can't keep up.\" \nCountry superstars Underwood and Paisley co-host the 49th Annual CMA Awards Wednesday, November 4 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:15:10.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
