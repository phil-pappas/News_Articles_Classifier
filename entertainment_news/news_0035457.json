I'm enjoying this.\" \nThat's a different take from the one Craig gave to Time Out London earlier this month, when he declared, \"I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists....All I want to do is move on.\" \nCraig now tells the BBC, \"I'm quite straightforward and I say things when I feel it and then I change my mind. I'm just like everybody else. People latch onto things. There's not a lot I can do about that.\" \nCraig has played Bond in four movies, including Spectre , which opens November 6. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
