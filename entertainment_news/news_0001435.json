News: \"The bottom line is that the Porsche Carrera GT is a dangerous car. It doesn't belong on the street. And we shouldn't be without Paul Walker or his friend, Roger Rodas.\" \nThe lawsuit also claims the car \"lacked safety features...that could have prevented the accident or, at a minimum, allowed Paul Walker to survive the crash\". \nMeadow claims that the car Paul was in \"had a history of instability and control issues but the company failed to install its electronic stability control system, which is specifically designed to protect against the swerving actions inherent in hyper-sensitive vehicles of this type\". \nHer lawsuit also disputes law enforcement's assertion that the crash was caused by speeding, with Roger driving between 80 to 93 miles per hour. Meadow claims his actual speed was between 63 and 71 mph. fast and furious", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:43:10.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
