Dumaplin\nOctober 12, 2015 Tim Tayag (Photo from eCircle Entertainment)\nFilipinos not only love to smile but they love to laugh a lot, too. We do like our comedy shows and we get our kicks from humorous situations and hilarious folks telling jokes.\nThis is what the Comedy Cartel is all about: Making audiences laugh with reality-based, respectable materials that is far from crass.\nThe group, established in 2007 and managed by eCircle Entertainment and Management Corp., provide multimedia comedy content including stand-up comedy, improvisation, ventriloquism, impressionism, among others.\nIt was professional stand-up comedian Tim Tayag, along with Allan Manalo and Patrick Cruz, who pioneered the group. Tim shared how the idea started while he was training comedy hopefuls for Jack TV’s “Laffapalooza” in 2007.\n“I wanted to help other comedians become better, more professional so, we decided to put up a professional group,” Tim shared.\nIt was also because Tim was tired of doing observational point-of-view, stand-up comedy by his lonesome.\n“When I found Allan I told him, ‘Hey, let’s form a group.’ Allan, at the time, was holding comedy workshops, so we kind of organized it, helping each other out. Si Patrick naman, came from a professional pool of managers. (One day), Patrick approached me, parang he knew what I was trying to do, so then I agreed na, ‘Sige we can form a group together,’” he related.\nNote that the Comedy Cartel steers from lewd jokes – something of a staple in stand-up comedy bars around the country.\nApparently, the group, which now also includes Michelle Defensor and Sherwin Cunanan, would rather stick to day-to-day experiences and stories common to Filipinos. These may include topics on family life, politics, technology, relationships, work, among many others.\nCatch the Comedy Cartel at Vu’s Sky Lounge Marco Polo Hotel, Ortigas today at 9:30 p.m., and on Oct. 19 and 26.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:55:49.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
