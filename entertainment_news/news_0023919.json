Some residents in this conservative timber town about 180 miles south of Portland accuse him of using the Oct. 1 rampage to justify gun control. They were already preparing to protest.\nOn Friday morning the autumn sun was already heating up the asphalt in front of the Roseburg Regional Airport, as dozens of sign-carrying demonstrators took their places.\nA small group of 60-something activists struggled with three 4-foot by 8-foot panels, each with a single word. The small crowd around them tried to help, but agreement was hard come by. Should it be \"Go Home Obama\" or \"Obama Go Home\"?\nAcross the street, Don Moody, an aircraft mechanic, was holding a sign he'd made five years ago, when his home state of Washington was struggling with gun control issues and he protested in Olympia.\nOn the front, his sign said, \"The Second Amendment Protects The First!\" He updated the sign's back just last night: \"Trump 2016.\"\nMoody, who lives in Seattle, got off his shift at Boeing at midnight, hopped in his car and headed south. Five hours or so later he arrived in Roseburg to ease his deep sadness over last week's shooting with action.\n\"I was appalled,\" he said of the Umpqua Community College massacre, the latest in a long string of such violence. \"I'm just crushed by it all. I'm so sad. I believe the government and the country are going in exactly the wrong direction.\n\"I had this discussion with an anti-gun friend this morning,\" the burly 59-year-old continued. \"It comes down to this: We don't want quantity, we want quality of guns -- in the right hands and at the right time.\"\nOther activists were spurred by anger at a president they said took advantage of a tragedy to push an agenda that is anathema to many here in conservative rural Oregon.\nRick Breen, a retired Army veteran carried two signs. The smaller one said simply, \"Go Away.\" The larger one rested on the pistol sticking out of his jeans pocket. \"We stand with Sheriff Hanlin,\" it said, referring to John Hanlin, the Douglas County law enforcement head, who is a staunch gun rights believer.\nGun rights, Breen said, was the second reason he drove some two hours from Brooks, Ore., to be here Friday. The main reason, he said, was \"to let Obama know he's not welcome here.\"\n\"It viscerally offended me that he uses something like this,\" the shooting at Umpqua, \"to pursue his own ulterior motives -- destroying this country, undermining America,\" said the 62-year-old, who bought his first gun at age 16 with proceeds from his paper route.\n\"I only wish a student had been armed,\" he said. \"We could have stopped that murderer in his tracks. I carry legally. I have a concealed weapons permit. We believe in the law. Criminals do not believe in the law. That's as basic as you can say it.\"\nOn the day of the Umpqua shooting, Obama, visibly frustrated, appeared in the White House press room.\n\"There's been another mass shooting in America -- this time, in a community college in Oregon,\" he said. \"That means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever.\"\nObama urged Americans to tighten gun laws, but didn't sound hopeful.\n\"What's become routine ... is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,\" he said. \"Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue. Fewer gun-safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?\"\nHours before Obama was set to arrive in this leafy timber town, a small community of television satellite trucks gleamed in the sun near the UCC entrance. A mobile prayer squad had set up shop too, in a big brown truck emblazoned with \"Billy Graham Rapid Response Team\" and \"Serving in Jesus' Name.\"\nThe camp was closed to outsiders, surrounded by orange traffic barrels laced together with yellow police tape. A Douglas County Sheriff's Department mobile command center had pride of place in the school parking lot, near banners that read \"UCC Strong\" and \"I Am UCC.\"\nA chain link fence at the edge of campus had been turned into a shrine to the victims, the school, the community, the peace that was shattered just over a week ago. Red, white and blue bunting fluttered in the breeze, and a sign exhorted passers by to \"Pray for Roseburg.\"\nHunting is popular in Douglas County, and so are guns. Obama's mention of gun control on the same day as the college shooting sparked some of the opposition.\nDavid Jaques, publisher of the weekly Roseburg Beacon, told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Monday that local officials didn't want Obama to visit.\nThe president, he said, gave his news conference before the bodies had been counted. \"Now, he wants to come to our community and stand on the corpses of our loved ones to make some kind of political point.\"\nThe next day, however, Roseburg city officials welcomed Obama and disputed media reports to the contrary.\n\"Since the announcement that President Obama may be in the Roseburg area on Friday to meet with the families that lost loved ones at Umpqua Community College, news outlets have been announcing that the president was not welcome in Roseburg. These announcements have included alleged Quote: s from community leaders,\" the city said in a statement.\n\"Unfortunately, individuals have been claiming to be speaking on behalf of the City of Roseburg. ... We wish to be clear that Mayor (Larry) Rich, City Council President (Tom) Ryan and the Roseburg City Council welcome the president to Roseburg and will extend him every courtesy.\"\nThe Douglas County Commissioners said they looked forward to Obama's visit. \"Regardless of our differences with the president on policy issues, we await the president's arrival and look forward to his show of support for a community who is grieving and whose heartache is immeasurable -- especially the families of those killed,\" the commissioners said in a statement.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735413", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735413&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735413&h=Obama+heads+to+Roseburg%2C+a+community+divided+over+his+visit"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:15:46.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
