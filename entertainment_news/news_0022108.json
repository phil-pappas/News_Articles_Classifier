By Eric Curl The Savannah City Council made one last-ditch effort to preserve the Savannah-Chatham police merger agreement during an emergency meeting called on Friday after the Chatham County Commission voted earlier in the day to end negotiations.\nThe 7-1 vote was to accept a merger agreement that the County Commission had approved on Sept. 11, despite the commission’s vote Friday to withdraw that agreement and begin preparations immediately to establish a new county police department.\nThe city’s vote was contingent on the county also agreeing to pay its share — about 24 percent — of the recently approved police pay increases through 2016. On Friday, the county voted to cover the police pay costs, but only from July to December this year — amounting to about $279,774.\nMayor Edna Jackson said the council voted to accept the withdrawn agreement because they wanted to show they were still fighting to continue the merger.\n“It is good for the county and the city,” she said.\nAlderman Tom Bordeaux, who voted against the motion, said the emergency vote was a waste of time because the county did not want to pay its share of the police pay increases.\n“That doesn’t sit right with me,” he said.\nAlderman Van Johnson was not at the meeting.\nCity Attorney Brooks Stillwell said that if the county did follow through with its vote to end negotiations, state law requires a referendum and the approval of voters to create a new county department. However, the county contends that the county department has continued under the merger agreement and no such referendum is required.\n“That would be for some court to decide if some citizen brought a suit about it,” Stillwell said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/CIty", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/CIty", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:14:23.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
