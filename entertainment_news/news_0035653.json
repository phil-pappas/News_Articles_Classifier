(Photo: Dana Edelson/NBC) \nSixteen months after comedian Tracy Morgan was critically injured in a car accident returning home from a Delaware show, the \"Saturday Night Live\" favorite is coming back to The First State. \nMorgan , who returned to host \"Saturday Night Live\" last weekend, will perform at The Playhouse on Rodney Square (1007 North Market St., Wilmington) on March 11 at 8 p.m. \nTickets, which cost $46-55, go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. via The Playhouse's box office, calling 888-0200 or going to duponttheatre.com . \nMorgan was traveling home June 7, 2014, on the New Jersey Turnpike following a show at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino when the limo bus he was riding in was struck by a tractor-trailer . \nMorgan spent more than a month in the hospital and a rehabilitation clinic recovering from his injuries, which included a broken leg, nose and ribs. Fellow comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair died in the crash. \nA year before the crash, Morgan headlined at the The Playhouse on Rodney Square , known then as the Dupont Theatre. \nTo preview the show, he spoke to The News Journal , saying, \"I enjoy doing show business. I can’t pick one genre. I love all of it. If God gives me enough time, I’ll do it all. I want to do Broadway. I want to direct a movie. It’s all about the experience.\" \nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.
