The Hyatt Place Washington DC/US Capitol , located in downtown Washington, DC just north of the US Capitol, knows that every meeting is important, no matter the size. The hotel is managed by Crescent Hotels & Resorts , an operator of over 100 hotels throughout North America, including 15 in the Washington, DC area.\n“When we opened our doors just a year ago, it was like opening a flood gate,” said Ryan Cimei, hotel General Manager. “With our downtown location, surrounded by so many corporate offices like NPR and Sirius XM, and government agencies such as the Department of Justice, ATF, and GSA, meeting planners were looking for a hotel just our size.” Being located just one and a half blocks from Metrorail connects the property to all points in the Washington, DC area, including Union Station, just one stop from the hotel, and National Airport. Additionally, its location in the NoMa district, surrounded the hotel with restaurants, shopping, and entertainment options, to keep meeting attendees busy after the work day is through.\nThe hotel offers the key amenities those planning smaller meeting are looking for. For example, complimentary Wi-Fi, business center and printing options, built-in break stations in both meeting rooms that total 1600 square feet, audio visual services, flexible catering menus and a dedicated meting specialist are among the amenities focused on meeting attendees. “Our meeting planners love working with our meeting specialists. Having a single point of contact is so crucial to them,” said Cimei. He added, “Our complimentary hot breakfast for all guests is a great way for meeting attendees on business travel to save money.”\n“We feel it’s good to give our meeting planners choices,” said Cimei. “We also understand that many who plan smaller meetings have responsibilities outside the meeting planning arena so we make the process stress-free.” Not only can planners submit a meeting request online, the hotel also offers the option of per person meeting packages starting at $85 per day so budgeting costs is easy. The Hyatt Place Washington DC/US Capitol is currently offering a special meeting package for groups gathering before March 31, 2016.
