The Huffington Post UK | By Rachel McGrath \n‘X Factor’ bosses are speculating over whether Jessie J told Tom Bleasby to quit the show last week. MORE 'X FACTOR': \nThe hopeful was picked as one of Nick Grimshaw’s boys, however he decide not to advance to the judges’ houses stage , just days after appearing on US TV with former ‘The Voice’ coach Jessie. \nJessie and Tom \nNow, The Sun reports that Tom also had dinner with Jessie, and a show source claims that bosses have considered how the ‘Do It Like A Dude’ singer might have influenced Tom’s decision. \n“It seems like a bit of a coincidence that Tom quits the show a few days after meeting with someone who openly hates ‘X Factor’,” they tell the paper. \nDespite performing on the show, Jessie hasn't exactly been full of praise when it comes to 'X Factor', and she previously claimed that the show gave hopefuls the chance to leap ahead, without putting the work in. \nThere’s no official word on who will replace Tom, and a source previously told the Mirror: \"It could be Mason, it could be Nathanael... It could be anyone of them. No decision made on this yet. \n“As it stands - they could go with Nick just having 5 boys or choose a replacement from the 6 Chair Challenge.\" \nTom quit ‘X Factor’ on Monday citing personal reasons, telling fans, admitting: “I just don't know if I felt vocally ready to take on the competition and the pressure.\" \nShortly after Tom confirmed the news on Twitter, mentor Nick congratulated him, tweeting : “Well done Tom for handling the pressure of the circus that is 6chair,” Nick tweeted. “And best of luck for the future x.” Close Songs That Should Be Banned From 'X Factor' of Performances include: Katie Waissel (2010), Jahmene Douglas (2012), Johnny Robinson (2011), Stacey Solomon (2009) Performances include: Lloyd Daniels (2009), Sam Bailey (2013), Matt Cardle (2010), Jack Walton (2014) Performances include: Alexandra Burke (2008), Leon Jackson (2007), Treyc Cohen (2010), Andrea Faustini (2014), Danyl Johnson (2009), Sam Callahan (2013) Performances include: Lola Saunders (2014), Shelley Smith (2013), Ruth Lorenzo (2008), Laura Johnson (2015) Performances include: Andrea Faustini (2014), Tamera Foster (2013), Leona Lewis (2006).
