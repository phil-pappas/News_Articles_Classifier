Will there be a DVD out for season four of “Longmire?” We have cable TV and not Netflix. \nA. The move of the modern-day western from cable to a streaming service has generated a lot of questions about when nonstreamers might see it. I expect there will at some point be a DVD release of “Longmire’s” fourth season to go with the three previous releases. Netflix originals, including “Orange Is the New Black” and “House of Cards,” eventually have made it to disc. But I do not have a release date. \nQ. Do you know what happened to the “Endeavour” program that was on PBS as an ongoing series along with “Inspector Morse” and “Inspector Lewis”? I really enjoyed it. \nA. For those of you tuning in late, “Endeavour” is a prequel to “Inspector Morse,” with young Morse in the 1960s played by Shaun Evans. (“Inspector Lewis” was a Morse sequel focusing on Morse’s former sergeant.) There have been two “Endeavour” seasons to date, each consisting of four episodes and airing on PBS’s “Masterpiece.” A third season is coming, with “Masterpiece” telecasts tentatively set for summer 2016. \nQ. Years ago, there was a fantastic TV show called “Farscape.” There has been recent talk about a movie that continues the series. Is this true or just wishful thinking? \nA. There’s more than wishing in the talk of a revival of the series, which originally ran from 1999 to 2003, with a 2004 miniseries wrapping up the main plot. In 2014, series creator Rockne S. O’Bannon said a movie was in the works, but according to reports at the time, he emphasized that production was a long way off. A script had to be finished first, and that does not appear to have happened yet. \nQ. Do you know how I could buy the entire production of “Northern Exposure” on DVD with the original music? My local library has what I want but won’t divulge its source. \nA. As far as I know, the authorized complete-series release of Northern Exposure has music substituted for what was in the original telecasts. The only packages I have seen that claim to have the original music are not authorized U.S. releases, and I don’t recommend any bootlegs. \nMusic gets substituted for a couple of reasons: because rights could not be obtained or because the cost of those rights would drive the DVD price too high to make it widely marketable. You could, after all, be talking about hundreds of songs in a series, as well as the original soundtrack compositions. Sadly, this is not only a problem for “Northern Exposure.” Other shows have had to either substitute music or delay DVD releases until rights could be worked out. \nQ. On the Hallmark Channel there was a show called “Signed, Sealed, Delivered.” Is it still on, or was it canceled or moved to another channel? \nA. It is still around, but not as a weekly series and not on the main Hallmark Channel, Instead, it is the basis for two-hour movies that air on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. \nQ. I saw the Simon & Garfunkel concert in Central Park four times on PBS, and enjoyed it more each time. But I have lived in New York, and I doubt very much that they had 500,000 people there. Can you shed any light on this? \nA. Calculations of crowd size have historically been less than scientific. I’ve had to do some myself – though not at an event of that size – and am rarely comfortable with my estimate. Even the numbers from authorities on hand can be called into question. When the concert took place in 1981, the New York Times cited a police estimate of 400,000. The New York Daily News, meanwhile, said 500,000, as did People magazine. \nDo you have a question or comment for the mailbag? Write to the Akron Beacon Journal, 44 E.
