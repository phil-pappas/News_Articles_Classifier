Further down the road, officials say, that shortage increases to more than 6,400 student seats across elementary, middle and high schools.\n“We are struggling with facilities right now because we are in growth mode,” Beaumont Unified School District board President Susie Lara said Tuesday, Oct. 13.\nBeaumont Unified officials brought together parents, state representatives and other community stakeholders Tuesday to communicate what the district is facing as it considers an action plan to secure land to build schools, deal with the layers of government bureaucracy and find funding.\nAmong those in attendance to discuss the issue were Beaumont-area state representatives, Sen. Mike Morrell, R-Rancho Cucamonga, and Assemblyman Chad Mayes, R-Rancho Mirage.\nBEAUMONT BOOM CONTINUES\nBeaumont was the sixth-fastest growing city in the state this year, according to the Department of Finance’s January projections, increasing in population by 4 percent over the previous year to 42,481 residents.\nTo put that in historical perspective, Beaumont had a population of nearly 11,400 in 2000 and nearly 37,300 in 2010, according to U.S. Census data.\nCity officials estimate developers will continue to build homes at a rate of about 100 units per year.\nWith growth not projected to slow anytime soon, the district knows it needs at least two new elementary schools within five years, said Ben Dolinka, president and CEO of Dolinka Group LLC\nDolinka Group LLC was hired by the district to prepare a facilities and funding action plan for the immediate, five-year window, and what to expect beyond that.\nThe district has land now, but it’s not the right size and not in the right locations for where the growth is anticipated, he said.\nThere are a number of funding sources already to accomplish some of this, according to Dolinka Group’s study, including just over $20 million available from a $125 million voter-approved bond measure from 2008.\nThere are nearly $10 million in developer fees from new homes and $24.3 million of projected developer fees based on planned homes.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50h-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckitc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50i-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckips.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50j-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckirs.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50h-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckiru.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50i-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckip6.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50j-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckirb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50j-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckive.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50j-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckirb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50h-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckitc.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50h-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckiru.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50i-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckips.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50j-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckive.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50i-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckitq.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50i-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckip6.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc50i-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckitq.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc50j-b88539393z.120151016155307000gquckirs.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:34:22.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
