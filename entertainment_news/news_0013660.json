Like super white.

Trust me, it’s … difficult for me to have to wait forever for my natural hair to grow back and to have to wear more fake hair than every drag queen on earth combined.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:13:30.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
