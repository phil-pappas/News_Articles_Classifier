Probably because they are the same person. Larry David as Bernie Sanders is stunningly perfect. — Philip Bump (@pbump) October 18, 2015 Larry David doing a better Bernie Sanders than the real Bernie Sanders on #SNL . pic.twitter.com/gUixYldfNF — Roger Simon (@politicoroger) October 18, 2015 #SNL making the internet's collective dream/meme come true with Larry David as Bernie Sanders. — Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) October 18, 2015 LARRY DAVID AS BERNIE SANDERS ON SNL IS THE GREATEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN — Mark Scoff (@makinmymark22) October 18, 2015 Larry David as Bernie Sanders should win someone a casting lifetime achievement award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:28:21.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
