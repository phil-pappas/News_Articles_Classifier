They were later joined by tens of thousands of mineworkers who have contracted silicosis and tuberculosis and the families of those who died as a result of the illness.\nA full bench of judges will hear arguments on class certification - whether or not the fundamentally unknown number of mineworkers with silicosis can claim damages as a class. Only then can the actual case can go ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:06:24.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
