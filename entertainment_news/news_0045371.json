The star filmmaker has now turned playback singer with his latest Bollywood directorial, Singh Is Bliing. As per the latest reports, Prabhu Deva recently recorded some scratch vocals composed by Sandeep Shirodkar. However, the producer of the film, Ashvini Yardi, liked the scratch version immensely and requested Prabhu Deva to croon for the final song.
