When asked by the Los Angeles Times whether she's ever been involved in a movie that attracted so much attention and controversy while she was making it, the actress replied, \"No. And the fact there was so much controversy because we were women was surprising to me. \n\"Some people said some really not nice things about the fact that there were women,\" she continued. \"It didn't make me mad, it just really bummed me out. We're really honoring those movies.\" \nGhostbusters opens next July. \nWiig currently can be seen on the big screen in The Martian . She also stars in Nasty Baby , available on demand later this week. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
