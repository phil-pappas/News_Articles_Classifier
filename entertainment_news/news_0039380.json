We also all knows why Organised labour and other many Civil Society organs were marching.\nThe ruling party can deny it as the wish but corruption is now a well-known fact in RSA that the word \"Corruption\" in a conversation by any age group of any race is followed by the Word \"ANC\" or \"Zuma\". Is fine we can deny it all we wish but deep down in heart we know that the biggest budgets votes speeches that are made on annual basis are only for the elite few because they are not spend on those who need it most or those who are said to be budgeted for.\nMost of us are brainwashed to fight and believe that we are liberating ourselves, but the truth of the matter is, we are fighting to liberate the RICH from the POOR and the POOR from the RICH.\nFor those still confused by this. Let me enlighten you that the service delivery protests you see today are the born child of corruption not liberation, The potholes you see on the road today are the born child of kickbacks.\nPeople, letâ€™s wake up before we sleep for good because of hunger while others are enriching themselves with our government budgets.\nA country such as ours with the highest inequality in the world, is the danger to itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:13:50.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
