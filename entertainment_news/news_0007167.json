The south London duo – who released their debut album, The Long Way Home, in July – has dominated this year's shortlist, after winning the best hip-hop act gong last year.\nBandmate Casyo \"Krept\" Johnson said: \"\"It means a lot to be nominated because I grew up watching the Mobos on TV. To get four nominations and lead this year's awards is crazy.\"\nJME has also secured four nominations – for best album, best song, best male act and best grime act.\nBoth acts face stiff competition from Mark Ronson, who has enjoyed global success for Uptown Funk, his collaboration with Bruno Mars.\nHe has been nominated in two categories, for best male act and best song.\nMeanwhile, Rita Ora has received a nod for best music video.\nThe new X Factor judge was shortlisted for Body On Me, which featured Chris Brown.\nJess Glynne is in the running for best female act – while Not Letting Go, her song with Tinie Tempah, has been named in the best song category.\nDrake, Kendrick Lamar and Dr. Dre are among the notable competitors for the best international album gong.\nWiley is also set to be honoured with the inaugural Paving The Way award, which will see a paving stone laid at his former secondary school in east London.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the Music of Black Origin awards, which celebrates urban talent.\nIt will be held at Leeds' First Direct Arena on 4 November - and voting for the awards opens to the public at 9am on Thursday morning.\nSarah-Jane Crawford, who will host the ceremony, said: \"This is one of the strongest nominees lists I've seen.\n\"That is testament to the artists themselves because you can't put a strong nominees list together if the music's not there, and this year the music has been there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:37:41.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
