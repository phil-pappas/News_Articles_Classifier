Floreano Rochester Riverside Convention to cap Rochester’s Hispanic Heritage Month. Dignitaries and community members gathered to celebrate a month of community outreach that included 12 events covering such topics as arts, health, and other areas.\n“The theme this year was ‘United by our roots,’” said Ray Mayoliz, the city’s manager for Youth Outreach and Violence Prevention, who was representing Mayor Lovely Warren. “We’ve taken the roots of a tree, how it’s all nurtured, and how it grows. Even though it might branch out in different ways, in different directions, our roots come from the same origins. That’s what we pride ourselves on. We are united by where we originated from. We’ve got to realize that we are united.”\nIt was an elegant evening of food, music, dancing, and a special scholarship presentation. Leadership Academy senior Geizi Gonzalez Reyes, a native of Honduras, received the Academic & Community Excellence Award for his perseverance.\nGonzalez Reyes started at Leadership in 2013 as an unaccompanied refugee student. He was supported by the Unaccompanied Refused Minor Foster Care Program at the Catholic Family Center and spoke no English when he started. He now maintains a 3.25 grade point average. The award comes with a scholarship to Monroe Community College.\n“We’re really proud of what the future looks like,” Mayoliz said. “The future is bright.”\nErica Hernandez, a member of the Hispanic Heritage Community and organizer of the gala, said the event is the perfect way to end the month.\n“To be able to come together and celebrate all the hard work, all the culture, and all the activities we’ve been able to bring to fruition, it’s an awesome experience,” Hernandez said. “We just love to share with the community and enjoy the culture and have a good time.”\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:24:43.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
