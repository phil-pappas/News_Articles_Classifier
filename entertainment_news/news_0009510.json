Passengers said he had bitten a man sitting near him and crew members sought to handcuff him before he lost consciousness. A doctor and nurse on board failed to revive him.\nCork police arrested a 44-year-old Portuguese woman traveling with the Brazilian man after discovering 2 kilograms (5 pounds) of suspected amphetamine powder in her suitcase.\nThe bitten passenger was admitted to a Cork hospital, while the other 165 passengers and six crew members traveled by bus to Dublin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:38:12.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
