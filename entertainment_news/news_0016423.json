The Bachelorette contestant Dave Billsborrow. Channel 10 Cars For Sale \nTHE last of the three Daves was sent packing from The Bachelorette tonight. \nSydney plumber Dave Billsborrow narrowly missed the cut for the tomorrow's all-important home visits, which will see Sam Frost travel the country to meet the families of her four remaining suitors. \n\"It was sad to leave the house but I get to move on with my life now,\" Billsborrow told APN. \n\"You do have to be careful when you're heading out. I didn't win Sam's heart but it has been hard for me to move on because I don't want to do the show any sort of injustice (by spoiling it).\" Dave pictured during tonight's group dinner date. \nGossip magazines have tried to link the 30-year-old to another Sam, singer Samantha Jade, whom he insists is just a good friend. \n\"Samantha is a beautiful person. I like hanging out with her,\" he said. \n\"I'm still a single man.\" \nBillsborrow admits to gravitating towards a friendship with Frost as he got to know her on the reality dating show. \n\"We had such good fun with each other and the banter was relentless, but I think we both knew,\" he said. \n\"I'd hate to fight for something that's not there. I do hope she finds what she's looking for.\" \nHe credits the show with helping him learn to open up about his feelings. \n\"I feel as if I can express myself a lot more,\" he said. \n\"We were almost forced to (on the show). You can't just there and have your thoughts to yourself. You have to explain them to everyone (watching at home). \n\"Being able to express myself in a relationship a lot more will definitely help because making sure both parties are on the same wavelength is a massive key in a relationship.\" \nHe tips either construction manager Sasha Mielczarek or soccer player and real estate agent Michael Turnbull to win Frost's affections. \n\"I'll be happy with whoever takes it out. I get along with all four of those guys so well,\" he said. \n\"I went into it not expecting to make the friendships I did. All my mates where going 'You're going to go in there and the boys are going to be show ponies'. \n\"Everyone just had that respect for each other. At the end of the day they're all there to fall in love.\" \nThe Bachelorette continues tomorrow at 7.30pm on Channel 10. channel 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:55:34.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
