We were 16. And I remember the first time, like I shook his hand....I fancied him!\" she says in one of the preview clips Lifetime released Thursday. \nIn the clips, she refuses to disclose the other original cast member she was intimate with, though she does rule out Ian Ziering. That would suggest it was either Jason Priestley or Luke Perry. \n\"Half my friends don't even know this!\" she declares. \nLifetime teases the answer will be revealed on its Tori Spelling: Celebrity Lie Detector special, airing at 10 p.m. Eastern time Saturday night. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
