Photo: Cameron Edney \n★★★☆ \nAdvertisement There's a moment during American hard-rock behemoth Kiss's 40th-anniversary tour that might knock you sideways like no other in their still elaborate, deafening, spectacular of a stage show.\nIt happens during Do You Love Me , when the screens show images from the band's storied past including the periods when they didn't wear the warpaint and costumes and – wait for it – looked like they wanted to be taken seriously for the music .\nPaul Stanley ... vocals, guitar and strut. Photo: Cameron Edney \nIt's a pretty comical notion, given the music has long taken a distant second place to the overall experience of a Kiss show.\nIt remains an experience like no other, with its abundance of dazzling lights and lasers, the wires and hydraulics that occasionally take the band skyward, a touch of fake blood and fire-breathing, and enough fireballs and explosions to simultaneously stop and restart the hearts of fans who have been there from the beginning and their (grand)kids alike.\nYet the book-ending of the set with the band's best anthems shows up too much of the music during the bulk of the show, when this unholy foursome – charismatic co-founders Paul Stanley (vocals, guitar, strut) and Gene Simmons (bass, vocals, tongue) and the more technically impressive 10-year-plus Kiss veterans Eric Singer (drums) and Tommy Thayer (guitar) – seem to be hoping the spectacle will distract you from other shortcomings.\nFor those listening closely, the opening is as explosive as everything else going on, with Detroit Rock City powering through in a blaze of, um, everything before a mighty, steely riffed Deuce .\nAfter that, you're better off reaching for a set of industrial-strength earplugs and enjoying the visuals until the encore arrives to brush aside choruses looking for a song such as Hell or Hallelujah .\nCome that finale, an invigorating Shout It Out Loud is welcome enough but thrillingly raises the stakes when it chugs straight into the always-rousing I Was Made for Loving You . Then a closing, exuberant Rock and Roll All Nite , complete with obligatory confetti cannons and yet more pyrotechnics, makes you remember why this band has sold so many albums.\nStill, in an age when few are making money from album sales, you can clearly see why Kiss are more bothered about selling concert tickets – and why few, when they get this almost full extravaganza, will complain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:11:21.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
