But one of the things that I always find striking is how the city has come to embrace one of its most unique natural resources - its wonderful bat population - and how through lots of effort they've drawn in not only the interest and support of residents but of tourists. This kind of commitment towards appreciating and protecting an important species is a lesson for other cities worried about the loss of natural resources.\"\nTritscheller, who works in bronze, has been crafting sculptures of bats for almost ten years and always found it curious when people said they loved the work but wondered why, out of all the creatures in the world, she chose to focus on a creature that many find scary or associate with horror movies.\n\"I've always found bats to be beautiful - their wings, their body shapes - but I also love the role they play in nature. One of the great things about having people engage with me about bats at a show or a public event is the opportunity to point out how great bats are and that's something that Austin has done for millions of people. Anyone who's joined the throngs on Congress Avenue Bridge just to see the bats fly at dusk know how beautiful they are in flight.\"\nBat Conservation International, the world's largest non-profit dedicated to the study and preservation of the globe's 1300+bat species, is also located in Austin. Ms. Tritscheller, a big fan of the organization, provides links and information about the group on her site and when she's traveling to shows around the world.\nTritscheller splits her studio time between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Thailand but loves to spend time in Austin when not working with her representing galleries in Shanghai, the Maldives, Taipei, Santa Fe and Napa.\nMore information about Ms. Tritscheller's bat series can be found online at www.coppertrischeller.com.\nRequests to speak with Ms. Tritscheller or requests for reproducible images should be directed to The Zephyr Group, Inc., This email address is being protected from spambots.
