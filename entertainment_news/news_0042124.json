Especially in this industry for the first time.\" \nHayek Pinault also slammed the films being churned by Hollywood. \n\"These romantic comedies are not working anymore. Why? We changed!,\" she said as the crowd clapped furiously. \"I think that this is the true part of equality.\" \nHayek Pinault co-founded Chime for Change with Beyonce and international fashion powerhouse Gucci in 2013. \n\"In only two years ... we have affected 3 million families and communities,\" she said. \nThe campaign supports nongovernmental agencies with the mission of empowering women and girls around the world through initiatives focused on education, health and justice. Chime for Change has so far raised $7.3 million with 153 nonprofit partners to fund projects in 88 countries, benefiting 400,000 women and girls. \nShe said Chime for Change is launching a new initiative called Chime for the Children of Syria. \n\"We are a fantastic generation,\" she added. \"I could not have made it without the women who gave me the strength today. For all of you who don't know what time for change is, it is a call for everyone to use social media for social justice.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:57:35.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
