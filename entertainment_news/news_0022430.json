Disneyland has closed its gates at times to control overflowing crowds.\nCurrent Premium passholders will be able to use their pass until it expires, but they will not have the option to renew. Monthly payment options are still available for California residents.\nDisney on its website Sunday morning also overhauled prices for annual passes at Walt Disney World. The Disney Signature Platinum Plus pass for visits to all four Disney World theme parks and water parks with no blackout dates is $829.\n“In addition to our continued investment in the guest experience and the expansion of our parks, our new selection of annual passes will help us manage strong demand and continue to deliver a world-class experience, while providing more choices for guests to select the pass that best meets their needs,” said Suzi Brown, a Disneyland spokeswoman.\nThe increase comes after The Walt Disney Co. this summer explored in an online survey a seasonal tiered pricing structure or demand-based pricing. The theme park – celebrating its 60th anniversary – is experiencing record attendance and is moving forward with plans to create a “Star Wars”-themed land.\n“We have to look at ways to spread out our attendance throughout the year so we can accommodate demand and avoid bursting at the seams,” Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Bob Chapek told The Wall Street Journal.\nDisneyland officials recently announced several attractions will close – some permanently, some for more than a year – starting Jan. 10, to make room for the 14-acre “Star Wars” land that will be built in the northern part of Frontierland and nearby backstage areas.\nMore than 16.7 million people visited Disneyland and another 8.7 million visited Disney California Adventure last year, according to The Themed Entertainment Association, a trade group that represents members of the theme park industry.\nThe latest price increase specifically targets Disneyland’s annual passholders, a core base that many unofficial Disney blog sites estimate at 1 million. Some have speculated the recent ticket increases are a much-needed way to reduce the large crowds that occurs at Disneyland during some weekends and high-demand seasons.\nBrown said since 2001 – when Disney California Adventure opened – the number of passholders have increased by 250 percent. She did not reveal how many annual passholders Disneyland has.\nThis is the second time this year Disneyland raised prices for annual passes. In February, Disney raised prices across the board by $3 for one-day, one-park tickets – now $99 a ticket – and raised some annual passes by 11 percent.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq18p-b88531765z.120151004172412000g8scd355.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq18p-b88531765z.120151004172412000g8scd353.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq18q-b88531765z.120151004172412000g8scd354.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq18p-b88531765z.120151004172412000g8scd355.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq18p-b88531765z.120151004172412000g8scd353.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq18q-b88531765z.120151004172412000g8scd354.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:25:20.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
