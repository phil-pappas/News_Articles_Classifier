Making up for everything I ever did and never did.\" \nThe singer continued: \"25 is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened.\" \nFans have had to wait four years for a new record after the star gave birth to her first son, Angelo, in October 2012. \nRecording sessions for the new album have continued sporadically since then, with producers reported to include Gnarls Barkley's Dangermouse aka Brian Burton, Swedish hitmaker Max Martin and One Republic's Ryan Tedder. \nA preview of the album appeared without warning on Sunday night, during an advertising break on The X Factor. Media caption Is this a clip from Adele's new album? \nThe 30-second clip featured the star's voice signing over a simple piano figure, accompanied by the lyrics on an otherwise black screen. \nThe lyrics were: \"Hello/It's me/I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet/To go over everything. \n\"They say that time's supposed to heal ya/But I ain't done much healing...\" \nAt the time, her representatives refused to confirm whether or not the material was actually by the singer. \nAdele's 21, which contained the mega-hit Someone Like You, is the biggest-selling album of the 21st Century, selling more than 30 million copies worldwide. \nIt shifted 4.75 million copies in the UK alone, making it the fourth best-selling album of all time, in an era when album sales have been in critical decline. \nAs yet, there is no release date for the star's new album, but several media reports have pointed towards 20 November as the likely day. \nAdele's statement, which appeared on Twitter and Facebook , is the first official confirmation of 25's existence. \nIn it, she said: \"I feel I've spent my whole life so far wishing it away. Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else, wishing I could remember and wishing I could forget too. \n\"Wishing I'd gotten to know my great-grandmother more… Wishing I hadn't cut my hair off… Wishing I'd waited and wishing I'd hurried up as well. \n\"Turning 25 was a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my 20s. Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into who I'm going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk. \n\"I miss everything about my past, the good and the bad, but only because it won't come back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:51:38.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
