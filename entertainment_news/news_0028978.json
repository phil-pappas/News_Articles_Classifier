I'm glad we have new stores coming, but I'm so sad to see this go.\n\"Oh, my gosh, we'd take trips to Evergreen Plaza. I'd shop here once a week. It was a big deal. I definitely liked Carson's and a cookie store on the lower level by the Christmas tree. Oatmeal raisin was my favorite. I'm a little sad, but we have bigger and better things coming,\" Simpson said.\nDevelopers of the new Evergreen Plaza, which is expected to have 30 to 40 stores, hope to hear similar stories of devotion in a few years.\n\"It's an exciting time for us,\" said Karl Zarbo, director of operations for Michigan-based Lormax Stern Development Co., which is working with DeBartolo Development on the project.\nSpeaking at a brief ceremony before demolition began, Zarbo said what some thought of as a \"million-square-foot, vacant, functionally obsolete property ... what we see as developers is an opportunity to bring a brand-new shopping center, first class, to your community.\n\"It's an opportunity to bring jobs to your community,\" Zarbo said.\nJay Adams, vice president of development for Florida-based DeBartolo, said, \"Enclosed malls are really not that fashionable or efficient,\" adding there's more interest nationwide in open-air shopping venues.\n\"To be here, working on this property, giving the community something that's going to be unbelievable, it's an honor,\" Adams said.\nEvergreen Park Mayor Jim Sexton joked that he \"wasn't quite sure this was going to happen this morning,\" noting that two or three other developments proposed at the site never materialized.\n\"I believe today somewhere with us is Arthur Rubloff, who had the foresight to build Evergreen Plaza in the early '50s. I know we've all come here to shop, so there's a lot of history here. But there's a lot of history to be made for the next several generations,\" Sexton said.\nWatching the wall come tumbling down, Sexton recalled his parents buying him an Easter suit at Evergreen Plaza, the nation's second indoor mall.\n\"It's bittersweet. But you've got to move forward. We're not caretakers. We're here to make something happen. That's the bottom line,\" he said.\nMost important, Sexton said, is that the project \"will be putting a lot of local people to work.\"\n\"There will be demolition jobs, construction jobs, and, by the way, all union construction jobs. That's the backbone of our community. Then we look to the retail jobs. People need retail jobs, the $10- or $15-an-hour jobs,\" Sexton said.\nSexton took the ceremonial first few swings at a wall with a sledgehammer, putting in a couple of dents, but not before asking whether he needed a union card to swing the hammer.\n\"It felt good. Took a lot of my frustration out,\" Sexton said of demolition work. \"I think when we come back here in a year, a year and a half, we can really celebrate because at that point, the cash registers will be ringing and the village will be getting sales tax.\"\nWhen done, the new Evergreen Plaza will offer about 425,000 square feet of retail space on 32 acres, according to a release.\nThe Carson's store at the south end of The Plaza will remain open before it moves into a new building at the southwest corner of the parcel that is expected to be open for shoppers in time for the 2016 Christmas season, store manager Deirdre Austin said.\n\"The new store will be a little smaller, but we have a very loyal following in the community. We're so excited to be part of this brand-new development,\" Austin said.\nLormax Stern and DeBartolo expect 30 to 40 stores will be included when construction is completed by late 2017.\n\"We cannot disclose any other retailer names just yet. Let's just say that Lormax Stern Development is finalizing a dozen new leases with popular national retailers, including an upscale food store,\" Sexton said.\nAdams also declined to name tenants.\nLormax Stern, in partnership with DeBartolo, bought The Plaza earlier this year. They are developing the property and negotiating leases.\nThis is the 10th redevelopment of a major retail mall undertaken by Lormax Stern.\nWhen Sue Greve, of Orland Hills, read about the demolition, she said she \"had to be here.\"\n\"It's history. It's memories. It's part of your childhood. Being able to have access to so many stores at one time was a novelty,\" said Greve, who grew up in Blue Island.\nAt one time, there were 155 stores in The Plaza. Her father, Bill, worked at the Firestone store near The Plaza.\nBut The Plaza's heyday is long gone and it has sat nearly vacant for years.\n\"Every time you have to say goodbye to something that meant something to you, it's sad,\" Greve said. \"But hopefully this is going to be a new beginning for this part of town. It's so important for Blue Island, Oak Lawn, Evergreen Park, all the surrounding communities.\"\nKathleen Fassl, who lives nearby in Chicago's Beverly community, said she'd \"rather walk here than drive to Chicago Ridge or Orland Park.\"\n\"The neighborhood needs this,\" Fassl said. \"Can you imagine what it would have cost to renovate this? They're better off doing this and starting from scratch.\"\nsmetsch@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Commercial Real Estate", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615a348/turbine/ct-sta-plaza-demolition-begins-st-1008-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:58:11.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
