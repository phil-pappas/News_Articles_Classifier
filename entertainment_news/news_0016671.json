(March 20 - April 19): Volunteering isn't just good karma, it's good for your social life too. You'll enjoy working beside people who come from different walks of life.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): You're chosen for a coveted spot, that's just the first step. Go the distance and you'll succeed beyond your wildest hopes.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): You know that certain someone who never called back? You could bump into him today. Dress to the nines and he's putty in your hands.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): Pursue the everyday things that make you happy and you'll find that much of your malaise disappears on its own.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): You know that supervisor you think has it in for you? He's actually a huge fan. Work with him because he can open doors.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): A competitor wants to woo you away. Call him back. You could use the ego strokes and he might make you an offer you can't refuse.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): People are working behind the scenes to promote your interests. Since you won't know who they are until after Nov. 10th, it pays to be gracious to everyone you meet.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): Say yes to any invite or plans to get together after work. An intriguing conversation with a fresh new face could lead to so much more.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): Don't worry about winning someone over because you already did. The job interview, audition, or application process is simply a matter of formality.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): You never know what fortune will blow your way when Venus conjoins Jupiter. Chances are it's something left behind-- like jewelry or a neglected boyfriend.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): Since when did a velvet rope or closed door ever stop you? Take your time figuring out who to target to gain entr√©e.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): You'll have to swallow your words when someone you dismissed comes through with flying colors. But it's OK. You're happy to take back what you said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:52:58.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
