I'm really sorry because I am a big fan of his. I think he's a gentleman and an extraordinary figure in music.\"\nPromoted stories He said he would definitely like to see Sir Tom back on the BBC \"doing something else\".\nThe BBC has previously launched a defence of popular programming like The Voice and The Great British Bake Off, saying that licence fee payers expect the BBC to \"deliver entertainment\".\nIn \"an evidence-based response\" to Culture Secretary John Whittingdale's green paper on its future, the corporation hit back at whether it should have a more \"precisely targeted\" mission in terms of its output.\nThis week, Rona Fairhead - chairman of the BBC Trust which governs the corporation - told the Lords' Communications Committee that the BBC should provide a \"universal service\" that broadly serves the UK rather than striving to do \"everything for everybody\".\nMs Fairhead said consultations with the public demonstrated the need for value for money, and that the licence fee model was deemed the best way to achieve this, rather than through corporate advertising and direct government funding.\nShare article She said previous input from the public resulted in a focus on \"distinctive drama\" on BBC One, citing the television adaptation of Hilary Mantel's historical drama Wolf Hall as an example of high-quality output.\nThe BBC has been contacted for comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-14T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:07:15.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
