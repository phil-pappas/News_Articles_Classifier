I never miss anything, I didn’t miss Tiswas, or Capital Radio.” \nTarrant’s new project is Channel 5’s Extreme Railways, which sees him exploring railways across the globe. \nIn 2014 he suffered a stroke while on a flight from Thailand to London, during the filming of Extreme Railways. \n“I am one of the lucky ones. I had some of the best medical care in the best hospitals. But 14 hours on a plane back from Bangkok was pretty scary,” he says. \n“I’m one of the survivors. I’ve changed my lifestyle a bit, stopped smoking, cut down on the booze, do a bit more exercise. It was a near death experience, but I’m having a good life.” \nChris Tarrant’s Extreme Railways airs at 9pm on Thursdays on Channel 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:45:07.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
