In partnership with American Girl, InPulse Digital developed an original 10-episode stop motion animated series, starring an all-new AG vlogger character named Z, for the official American Girl YouTube Channel . “Z’sCrew” is a first of its kind for the popular brand and connects the passions, interests and originality of American Girl fans, inspiring them to contribute their own creative expressions using their favorite American Girl dolls. “The intense fandom of American Girl was a great source of inspiration for us at InPulse. We believe these devoted followers deserved new and creative ways to share their own stories of how they interact with their dolls. This American Girl project plays to our strengths as a content-driven digital and social media agency,” said the Founder & CEO of InPulse Digital, Diego Prusky.\nSince September 3, 2015, American Girl has been reaching out to its fans on YouTube and social media by releasing weekly original short stop motion animation episodes as examples of original storytelling content to stimulate and inspire American Girl fans’ own creativity.
