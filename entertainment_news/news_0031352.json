He plans to publish a book that delves into the process of crafting a movie’s screenplay.\n\nImtiaz Ali \nImtiaz, who is busy with the post-production of Tamasha starring Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, says he dedicates a lot of time these days to writing. “I think that de-stresses me and I thoroughly enjoy the process. I like to develop an idea or story into a script. I am now penning a book that will focus on film writing. It doesn’t follow an idea. It’s about jotting the experiences I go through while scripting.”\nHe reveals that he was not meant to write the script of his fourth film, Jab We Met (2007). “The producers liked my concept and immediately decided to take it on floors.\nI remember I started scribbling the screenplay while travelling to the location. Interestingly, I won an award for the dialogues. Thereafter, everyone was keen that I write for all my films,” says Imtiaz.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:33.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
