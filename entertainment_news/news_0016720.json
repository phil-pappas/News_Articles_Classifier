Normally in gothic romance you end with (the male hero) carrying the girl without a shirt and rescuing her from imminent danger,” del Toro told Reuters in an interview. \n“I wanted to sort of actualize the genre a little bit and make the female roles the central roles.” \nDel Toro, best known for “Hellboy” and “Pan’s Labyrinth”, directed, produced and co-wrote the film, which also stars “The Martian” actress Jessica Chastain as Sharpe’s sister Lucille. \n“In this story the heroine saves herself. I think that’s very powerful because … in many ways we all have to do that,” Hiddleston said on del Toro’s aim to subvert expectations about gothic romance. “It did feel rare, it felt like the right way to move the genre forward.” \n“Crimson Peak” is released in cinemas from Oct. 14. \n(Reporting By Sara Hemrajani Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:56:04.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
