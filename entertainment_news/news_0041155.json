Donations accepted CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGladys Armstrong understands how devastating cancer can be. \n“I had nine brothers, and seven have died of cancer,” she said, “and I had three sisters and one of them died of cancer.” \nSo much tragedy can lead a person to lose hope. Instead, Armstrong saw an opportunity. As a former deputy grand regent of the Great Falls Moose Lodge, she knew how much an organization with national reach could help, so she urged the local women’s Moose chapter to create the Cancer Awareness Fundraiser. \n“We are an international organization of men and women dedicated to helping children, the elderly and community service,” Armstrong said, “and this cancer fundraiser is one of our community service projects for the last couple months.” \nThe event takes place Saturday, Oct. 17 at the Great Falls Moose Lodge and Family Center in Black Eagle. The lodge opens its doors at 4 p.m. for a benefit that supports Gift of Life Family Housing and Moose charities for the treatment of childhood cancer and breast cancer. \n“I’m so impressed with Gift of Life Foundation. Families live there free when they have an illness and they can’t afford to go back and forth for treatment,” Armstrong said, adding that nationally, the Moose have a home for children in Illinois and a home for the elderly called Moose Haven in Florida. \nThe Smokey Bluez Band plays from 4 to 6:30 p.m. in a performance generously donated by the band, and Mickey and Minnie Mouse will be on hand for the kids from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. \nA dinner of chili and baked potatoes with all the fixings and cake for dessert is provided by the Moose Lodge. There is no charge for the food, but the organization encourages those who can to make donations. \nDr. Jonathan Bingham speaks on melanoma after Mickey and Minnie leave, and silent auctions will be going all evening \n“The silent auction has all kinds of goodies, including a free pumpkin for every little child donated by Birch Creek Colony,” said Armstrong. Other items include two buff-and-shine car washes from City Motors retailing at $80 each, a hand-built wine rack, polar fleece blankets and more. \nArmstrong emphasizes that there are lodges in every state and in Canada, and the donated funds go to programs that help everyone, not just Moose Lodge members. She hopes the community will come out to support the cause. \n“It’s food, fun, entertainment and learning with Dr. Bingham,” Armstrong said. THE ESSENTIALS \nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 17 at 4 p.m. \nWhere: Moose Lodge, 401 21st St., Black Eagle \nCost: Free.
