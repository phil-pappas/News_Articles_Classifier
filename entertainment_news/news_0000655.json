By ERIC WOODS FOR A-J MEDIA \nGrupo Vida brings life to Brownfield’s Harvest Festival \nWith the three-time Grammy-nominated Tejano powerhouse Grupo Vida, you are going to get more than you bargained for. \nThat’s mainly because the band isn’t just a Tejano group, it is also a country music band called The Electric Cowboys. \nWhen asked why the group performs under two names, frontman Jason Martinez said band members want to keep all of their fans happy. In addition to performing under two band names, Grupo Vida/The Electric Cowboys are releasing two albums — one a Tejano album and the other a country music record. \n“What we did was we were Grupo Vida for a long time on the Tejano scene, but we also like doing other kinds of music,” said Martinez. “Country is our equal favorite and we just started doing a lot of country songs.” \nThe San Antonio-based band is made up of Martinez, Tim Villanueva, Michael Molini and Manny Gonzalez. They are scheduled to perform at 8 p.m. Friday at Coleman Park in Brownfield as part of the city’s Harvest Festival. Also performing will be the Odessa-based Dj Tony Live, who will be spinning his own unique brand of music. There is no charge to attend the concert. \n“The reason we are releasing two albums is because on the country music side, we need to stay focused on the country music fans,” said Martinez. “On the Tejano side, we try to focus on the Tejano crowd because they are hard-core and they are very Tejano-proud. We would rather keep it the way it is to please our fans.” \nMartinez said the band hopes to have a new country album out by November and a Tejano album out by December. The band also recently brought home a win for “Modern Single of the Year” at the Country Blast Music Awards. \nNo names have been chosen for the albums, but Martinez said one of the albums has the working title “Back to the Future” because it puts a new spin on some of the band’s older tunes. Martinez said the fans have been asking for some of the older tunes to be brought back. \n“We are going to re-record a lot of our older songs people have been asking for, and that will include songs from when the band first started,” Martinez said. “We are going back in time and using those to take us into the future — and we really thought that was a cool phrase.” \nMartinez said most of the guys, including the band’s manager, grew up together on the south side of San Antonio. They began playing together in the 1990s. \nMartinez said the band has been performing in Lubbock for many years, with each local performance attracting more and more fans. \n“We’ve played in Lubbock several times, and we’ve been going to Lubbock for years, recently it’s really started to hit for us,” said Martinez. “We’ve been blowing the roof off in Lubbock and we are trying to stay a little more busy there. \nMartinez said the band will perform country tunes as well as Tejano music for the Brownfield concert. He said they will also be playing some of their older hits as well as some new material. \n“The one in Brownfield is going to be a little bit different because we are going to be doing a mixed show,” he said. \nPROVIDED BY GRUPO VIDA ■ Who: Grupo Vida/The Electric Cowboys with Dj Tony Live. ■ When: 8 p.m. Friday. ■ Where: Coleman Park in Brownfield. ■ Tickets: No charge. ■ Information: Brownfield Chamber of Commerce 637-2564 or http://grupovidaonline.com/home.
