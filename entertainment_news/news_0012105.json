Bennett (guitar, banjo), Jeff Hamm (percussion) and Steve Brewer (bass, saxophone). \nBelfast — The Half Moon Jug Band will perform Saturday, Oct. 24, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Belfast Breeze Inn, 192 Northport Ave., as part of its Saturday Dinner Show series. \nHalf Moon Jug Band is a three-man mob of musical desperadoes who wage a daily battle against the humdrum forces of boredom and inaction, fending off the blahs with banjoes, kazoos, guitars saxophones and silliness. Jug band music is homemade music, a bubbling casserole of music as diverse as America itself, and this band thrives on interaction with their audiences. They do whatever it takes to put on a show for all ages, studding every performance with jokes, stories and mandatory sing-alongs. \nThe Half Moon Jug Band started more than 15 years ago as a merry band of sidewalk subversives, entertaining passersby and annoying shopkeepers on Exchange Street in Portland. Now they can now be found on the road, playing concerts and festivals all over the Northeast including New Year’s Portland, the Maine and Old Port festivals, Prescott Park Folk Festival, Oddfellow Theater, the Winthrop Performing Arts Center, Maine Lobster Festival, and many town concerts. Half Moon Jug Band has made many live appearances on television and radio including WCSH’s “207,” WGME’s “Daybreak,” WPFO’s “Good Day Maine,” WMPG’s “Local Motives” and WCTN’s “Shine.” In 2013, the band released its fifth album “The North Pond Hermit Sessions,” following 2009’s “Get the Show on the Road,” 2005’s “Jug Band Army,” 2003’s “Christmas on Exchange Street” and 2001’s “Space Man in a Jug Band.” \nDoors open at 4 p.m., and the dinner is served at 6 p.m. Dinner shows are $15 per person with a set menu, which can be checked out online; admission for just the performance is $10. The inn also has a weekly Tuesday Jazz Supper Club and other events; for more information, call 505-5231 or visit belfastbreezeinn.com . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
