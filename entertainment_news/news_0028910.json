He leads the orchestra from a motorized wheelchair.\nMet General Manager Peter Gelb said in a statement Friday that \"conducting evening performances of 'Tannhaeuser' while rehearsing Lulu in the daytime would be an ambitious undertaking for any maestro.\"\nLothar Koenigs will conduct the first five performances of the William Kentridge staging of \"Lulu,\" which opens Nov. 5. \"Tannhaeuser\" opens Oct. 8.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
