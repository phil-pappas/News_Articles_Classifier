Even before Boxer, starring Dhananjaya, is released, Gubbi has completed shooting for the first schedule of his new film.\nThe film has been titled Naanu Mattu Varalakshmi and this is where the name is being revealed. The first schedule including debut actor Prithvi (who incidentally is the grandson of the famous yesteryears music composer GK Venkatesh), Malavika Mohanan, Prakash Rai, Madhubala and others was completed in Mysurur and Ooty on Sunday.\nWhat catches attention is Prakash Rai who has been given an interesting makeover. \"Even I was thrilled when Prakash sir told me that he really liked the role he was playing. If an actor like him is happy with the role, I cannot ask for much more. He plays a biker and a race trainer in the film. Like the film itself the characters are unique,\" says Gubbi.\nThis is the first \"hardcore bike racing film\" in Kannada and probably India, says Gubbi. The reason for choosing bike racing as a subject was because of the lead actor Prithvi. \"Prithvi looks like a sportsman. He is 6.3 and athletic. It was because of his looks that we decided on a film with sports as the backdrop and bike racing or moto-cross is hardly showcased in Indian films. And in this film it is not just a backdrop. It is the soul of the film.\"\nThe film will show two moto-cross races which will be shot in the race track of CS Santosh, the first Indian to complete the Dakar Rally . \"When researching about racing, we came across details about CS Santosh. He is from Bengaluru and has been a great source of inspiration. We will be shooting at his race track in Kolar.\" The film is produced by Prithvi's father Manjunath. Meanwhile Gubbi has planned a Deepavali release for Boxer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:11:46.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
