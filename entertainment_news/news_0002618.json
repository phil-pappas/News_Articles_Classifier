Her new memoir Natural Born Keller: My Life and Other Palaver (Allen & Unwin) follows her from a teenage crush on Barry Manilow to parenthood, working on TV with Andrew Denton and beyond.\nThe Narrow Road to the Deep North \nRichard Flanagan\nI kept hearing about this book, and I saw it in every bookshop I entered. I'd pick it up and put it down again. To be honest, it seemed like such hard emotional work. But I found its pull overwhelming, and I finally bought it on holidays in Europe. Not my normal holiday read. Yes, it is emotionally hard going, but this book still vibrates so vividly for me. It's so beautiful, tragic and moving. I can't recommend it highly enough.\nAdvertisement Bossy Pants \nTina Fey\nI've never been a reader of autobiographies … until this one. I loved how hilarious and smart it was. She came from a normal suburban (tragedy-free) upbringing – unusual, it seems, for comedians – and still became the sharpest, funniest tool in the shed. Since then I've really loved autobiographies by funny women ... Denise Scott, Amy Poehler, Judith Lucy.\nEvery cook book ever written\nI buy them all, and  flick through them while I'm watching telly. I can't remember the last time I cooked from one of them, but like pornography for men, I look and dream.\nGuess How Much I Love You\nSam McBratney and Anita Jeram\nThis is the one where the mummy bunny tries to explain to her baby bunny how much it is loved. I bought it when I was pregnant with my first son, and cried at the counter of the bookshop as I turned the pages. I read it to both my boys, and have never made it through once without tears.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:06:07.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
