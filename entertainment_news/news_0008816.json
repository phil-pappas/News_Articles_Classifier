They try to bark, but all that comes out is a howl. And their masters have the final growl.Dog No. 1 is Kartik Aaryan whose odd jobs include distinguishing between salmon pink, carnation pink, hot pink and magenta pink. He is also assigned tasks like nodding vigorously to the garish nail colours that Nushrat Bharucha sports, and posing for selfies behind the wheel. Dog No. 2 is Sunny Singh who salivates at Sonalli Sehgal — a girl who has no qualms about parading her hot bod, but has trouble finding her spine before her conservative parents. Dog No. 3 is Omkar Kapoor, the libidinous of the lot, who falls for Ishita Sharma — a gold digger with superhuman shopping powers.The trio has come a long way from their shabby existence in a crammed abode four years ago. Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 shows them sharing a luxurious pad, blowing away money. The men aren’t any wiser though. They woof-woof around their eye-candies, buying them everything, from vegetables to sandals to iPhones. Director Luv Ranjan runs down his heroines, portraying them as either bimbos or manipulative. Nevertheless, all of them come loaded with enough sexual charm to keep their men hooked. So much so that the men forsake cricket matches for shopping! Sense prevails only when credit cards max out.The first had some punch. The sequel lacks freshness as it revolves around the same old premise — of blaming women for every misfortune that befalls mankind. Still, there are some sparkling one-liners to make up for all the girl-bashing by the frustrated, flirtatious bunch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:59:42.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
