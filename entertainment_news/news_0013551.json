He said he hadn't performed in two months or walked in a month.\n\"I'm a stand up for y'all. I appreciate y'all for having me,\" he said.\nRocker Dave Grohl performed similarly this summer on his Foo Fighters tour after breaking his foot at a show in Sweden.\n\"This (accident) was real scary, you feel me, I ain't going to even lie,\" Wap said. \"If I (mess) up, don't worry about it.\"\nTaylor Hill/FilmMagic \"I swear to God I never thought this (song) would bring me this far,\" Wap said of \"Trap Queen.\" The rapper has had a breakthrough year with multiple hits, including the pop smash \"Trap Queen.\" His self-titled debut came in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart earlier this month, and his other Top 10 pop hits include \"679\" and \"My Way.\"\nHe performed those songs — along with another Top 40 hit, \"Again\" — for the feverish crowd, also there to see headliner Kendrick Lamar, Future, Big Sean, Rick Ross and Meek Mill, whose girlfriend Nicki Minaj stood onstage as he performed.\nWap, 24, also offered words of encouragement to the concertgoers who aspire to one day succeed in music.\n\"I swear to God I never thought this (song) would bring me this far,\" he said of \"Trap Queen,\" ''and I say that to say that this (stuff) ain't hard. If you really want to do this (stuff), get up, hit up the studio, and do what you do, man.\n\"If you have that talent, put that work in.\"\nRelated Stories Fetty Wap slapped with three summonses for motorcycle crash Fetty Wap recovering after motorcycle crash in N.J.
