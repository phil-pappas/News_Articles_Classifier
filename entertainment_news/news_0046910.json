Part of the credit for the makeover goes to the film’s director Sanjay Gupta. Irrfan said, “The look was planned in detail before the shoot began. The designer gave his idea, but Sanjay made a lot of changes to it — he was very particular about the texture and fabric of each outfit. Sanjay can be very precise if he has something in mind and won’t accept anything less. So the designer had to rework the outfits a few times before it looked like what Sanjay had envisioned.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:26:46.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
