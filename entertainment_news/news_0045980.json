Brooks recently earned the top spot of any country artist on Forbes’ list of the top-earning celebrities, while Pollstar crowned him the top touring country artist for the first half of 2015.\nBrooks and Yearwood also received side-by-side stars on the Music City Walk of Fame in Nashville in September.\nYou Think You Know Garth Brooks?", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wak7xxB9upQ", "http://tasteofcountry.com/garth-brooks-highest-paid-country-artist-forbes-celebrity-100/", "http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/garth-brooks-lost-all-the-new-songs-he-recorded-in-the-last-six-months-b99584558z1-329600251.html", "http://tasteofcountry.com/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood-music-city-walk-of-fame-stars/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/garth-brooks/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/garth-brooks-pollstar-touring-revenue/", "http://tasteofcountry.com/tags/trisha-yearwood/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:18:51.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
