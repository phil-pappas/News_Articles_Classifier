I was proposed to in Venice and I said yes to my lovely fiancé. I love you sweetheart💜 @Josh1on1 pic.twitter.com/1Jo9cpJpYt \n— Eve Woerdenweber (@GoggleboxEve) September 23, 2015 Filming #gogglebox and trying not to stare at my beautiful ring from my beautiful fiancé & soul mate. #engaged pic.twitter.com/DIwCiqPnsw \n— Eve Woerdenweber (@GoggleboxEve) September 25, 2015 \nEve had previously dated Silent Jay, who appeared with her and her family on the award-winning TV show about TV-watching, and who became a fan favourite thanks to his mad hair, bizarre facial expressions and the fact that he never said anything. (Channel 4) \nThe pair split in early 2015 and Jay moved out of the family home and left the show, as he couldn’t really play happy families any longer on screen with his ex. \nAt the time, Jay reportedly said of the split: “I’m gutted that Eve broke up with me. It came completely out of the blue. \n“We had a few problems and started drifting apart but I thought it was down to the pressure of the show and her business. We argued too much and she said couldn’t cope with it.” (Jude Edginton/Channel 4) \nTattoo artist Eve, who still appears on Gogglebox with mum Viv and her German-born husband Ralf, quickly moved on with Josh and has now accepted his proposal of marriage.
