Â© Warner Bros. On whether he pictures Reeve's incarnation of the superhero alongside Melissa Benoist's new take on Supergirl, Brooks told Screen Rant: \"Christopher Reeve, since he was the Superman for me, will always be my Superman first of all. Probably so.\" Brooks also said that Marc McClure's turn as Daily Planet photographer Jimmy was particularly influential on how he played the role.\"I grew up on the Richard Donner movies, so Marc McClure was my first introduction to Jimmy. I thought he was great,\" Brookes added Producer Sarah Schechter has previously said that Supergirl will keep the \"fun\" and \"real\" tone of Reeve's movies by moving away from the grit of later adaptations.She explained: \"The tone of those movies was just really fun, you know? And it doesn't mean the stakes don't feel real, it doesn't mean that there isn't danger. It doesn't mean that characters won't die, but the hopefulness of that world, the fun of that world for us was just, it was irresistible.\"And look, people have hard lives, people have to work at jobs they don't like, they have to struggle to feed their families. There's enough darkness in the world that to give people an hour of hope and excitement and possibility, I don't think it's a bad thing. I think it's a really good thing. \"Supergirl stars Benoist as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-el, alongside the likes of Calista Flockhart, Levi Miller and Jenna Dewan-Tatum.
