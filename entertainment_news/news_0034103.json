Produced by Mark Huffam, Simon Kinberg, Michael Schaefer, Scott and Aditya Sood. Written by Drew Goddard (screenplay), Andy Weir (book). \nWith Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Kristen Wiig. \nFinally! A botanist superhero! \nWhat took you so long, Hollywood? \nRidley Scott's \"The Martian\" is arguably the warmest, cuddliest film ever made about the Red Planet, and that's all the more surprising given Scott's mastery of beautiful, haunting, nearly cold-to-the-touch futuristic movies such as \"Blade Runner,\" \"Alien\" and \"Prometheus.\" \nWe love those films, but they aren't exactly warm and fuzzy. \"The Martian,\" on the other hand, is a hopeful love letter to science and math, American resolve, the power of friendship and the dream of a world in which nations set aside their differences to unite to bring one man home. \nIt's also a visual stunner, and it features one of our most likable and dependable actors giving a performance that ranks with anything he's ever done. \n\"The Martian\" is set in the near future, in a world where NASA apparently has kazillions of dollars, and the third manned (and womaned) mission to Mars has set up camp on the Red Planet and is going about its daily business of collecting samples, monitoring the atmosphere and doing other astronaut-type stuff. \nMatt Damon is Mark Watney, a brilliant botanist with a corny sense of humor, undying loyalty to the Cubbies, love of deep-dish pizza â€” and an explorer's spirit, as evidenced by his joining the Ares 3 team on this mission. Jessica Chastain is the commander, Kate Mara is the computer expert, Michael Pena is the wisecracking family man, comic-relief astronaut. They're a neat team, and for the first few scenes, \"The Martian\" feels like it's going to be a prototypical ensemble-cast space adventure. \nBut then a massive dust storm hits harder and faster than anticipated, forcing the crew into emergency evacuation mode. Believing Mark has been killed by a flying piece of a communications tower, Cmdr. Lewis tearfully issues the order to take off. \nWhen Mark regains consciousness, he wakes up to a world of hurt (he has suffered a severe abdominal injury) and the brutal truth of his circumstances: He's injured, he's alone, he has no means of communication and a limited supply of food, and he is almost certainly going to die on Mars. \nNot that Mark is the type to give up. \nDamon strikes just the right notes of comedy, nerdy tech talk, moments of despair and triumph, especially in his running video diary. Mark cannot believe the music library of Cmdr. Lewis (it's heavy on cheesy 1970s tunes) or the nerdy video games left behind. When he builds a greenhouse of sorts and successfully engineers actual plant growth, he hops around with glee, calls himself the first Martian and says, \"In your face, Neil Armstrong.\" \nAnd when he miraculously hears from his crew, he's overcome with emotion. \n\"The Martian\" is three movies in one: \n* The primary story of Mark's solo adventures on Mars, where he tries to grow food, establish communication, repair a transportation vehicle and simply survive. \n* Cmdr. Lewis and crew on the ship, well on the way home, and the decision they'll have to make when they learn their friend is alive.
