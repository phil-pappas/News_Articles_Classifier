A comfier experience is in store for patrons of the Holland 7 theater. Theater five is being outfitted with state-of-the-art recliners from Holland-based Telescopic Seating Systems , and should be open for business within a week. The remaining six theaters will be upgraded in late November. The Holland 7, 500 S. Waverly Road, will be Goodrich Quality Theaters ’ first complex featuring recliner seating in all auditoriums. The Grand Rapids-based company plans to use Telescopic Seating Systems upgrades at its theaters throughout Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. Goodrich declined to provide the cost of the Holland 7 project, revealing only that it’s in the six-figure range, according to a release. The installation cuts theater five’s capacity from 175 to 88, and will have similar effects in the other auditoriums. “We’re hoping local people will stay local to watch movies,” said Martin Betz, chief operating officer for Goodrich. With the reduced seating, Betz said the company is hoping the auditoriums will be full more often, attracting more people than the previous seating arrangement did. “We have no immediate plans to raise prices,” he said. The last time the 31-year-old theater’s seats were upgraded was at least 15 years ago, said Brian Eichstaedt, Goodrich regional manager. “We’re excited,” said Jason Ealy, Holland 7 general manager. “It’s definitely time. I think customers will enjoy it. That’s the whole goal, to get more people to be comfortable when they’re watching a movie.” The seating system is the first of its kind to be installed in North America, said Fred Jacobs, Telescopic Seating Systems managing director. What makes the seats special is not how comfy they are, but the ability to recline all seats, or any configuration of them, with the touch of a button. This allows for quicker cleaning access under the recliners, saving labor time. The technology is dubbed the Clean Sweep System with Smart Power. “It takes 15 seconds to do what would take 20 minutes by hand,” Jacobs said. The Clean Sweep System was designed by Holland-native Matt Jacobs, engineering manager at Telescopic Seating Systems, along with a team of engineers. He said it’s nice to be installing the first system right in Holland, where he can troubleshoot with the customer onsite if needed. The recliners are an important upgrade because “seats are one of the few things every customer interacts with; not everyone buys popcorn,” Matt Jacobs said. Page 2 of 2 - Two chair designs will be installed in auditorium two, the only stadium seating house in the Holland 7. Wide armrest chairs will be in the stadium style area, while recliners will be installed between the cross aisle and the screen. The remaining auditoriums will have all recliner seating. Once recliners are installed, the theater will introduce reserved seating to allow customers to choose their seat assignment online or on the touch monitors at the theater. The project also includes new carpet and tile in all auditoriums and the lobby, and a new concession stand. — Follow this reporter on Twitter @SentinelJustine and @BizHolland .
