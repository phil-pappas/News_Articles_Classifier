I think everybody has every expectation that it will,” Kirby said yesterday. Less than two weeks ago Modi met President Barack Obama at the UN headquarters in New York on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly meeting. In the last one year the two leaders have met five times. \nPrior to that, US Secretary of State John Kerry and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker also hosted External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Union Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the first ever India-US Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. \n  10, 2015 7:09 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:21:36.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
