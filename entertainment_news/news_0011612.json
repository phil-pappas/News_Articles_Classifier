In 2009, The Patterson House introduced Nashville to the trend, reviving classics from the pre-Prohibition era while reinventing others. In pursuit of boozy libations, discerning tipplers have become better acquainted with artisan liquors, ancient liqueurs, creative housemade syrups, bitters and shrubs, and singular cuts of ice. Now, it is de rigueur for restaurants to include a cocktail program. And there are more places specifically dedicated to these drinks, expertly crafted, artfully served. This review visits two such spots where spirits soar -- to the rooftop lounge of Up at the Fairfield Inn & Suites and up the \"secret staircase\" in Savarino's to Amari speakeasy bar. \nUp Rooftop Lounge \nWith complimentary valet service and clear signage directing you to the proper elevator, the folks at the Fairfield Inn make it easy to visit their rooftop lounge. In moments, you are transported to an incomparable view of Nashville. Perched over Division at Ninth Avenue, you see the city from an uncommon perspective. Pick out the silhouettes of Union Station to the left, trains chugging across the scene; going right, the viaduct, the rippling green roof of Music City Center, and beyond that the old stone church on Sixth Avenue South. Look down and see Yazoo beer and other denizens of the lower Gulch. And at many points, the sweeping arms of construction cranes. At sunset, the autumn sky ablaze, the cityscape is a stunner. \nThe rooftop cocktail lounge is new to the group of Fairfield Inns — this one is a first. Inside is the bar, with ample viewing windows, should the weather be too anything. The deck though, is the place to be. There are high-top tables for dining, couches and chairs for socializing. They’ve done a fine job of creating a place to sit, sip and watch the city spin. Their cocktails are well made, using top-shelf booze and ingredients. Order a drink, relax and enjoy being Up.Their Bluegrass Sazerac is potent, to be savored in languid fashion. It is classically crafted: absinthe, Peychaud’s and Angostura bitters, Bulleit rye whiskey over a single rock, with a twist. The Bonnie and Brown melds peach bitters, fresh lemon juice, agave syrup with Belle Meade Bourbon for new take on an Old Fashioned. Ginger syrup brings a breathy dimension to Up’s Mint Julep.

Sliders stacked with caramelized onions and bacon jam and plates of crispy truffle fries are the most popular. The oven baked crisps, aka flatbreads, are also a good bet. Ours was a mince of pork and fig under a blanket of Manchego cheese, striped with balsamic syrup. We had hoped for more figs, but were satisfied nonetheless. Remember, though, that this is a place for great drinks and a spectacular view. The food is secondary.

(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean) \nAmari Speakeasy \nWhen you approach the hostess stand inside Savarino’s Cucina in Hillsboro Village, glance to your left. There’s a folding door, designed to look more like a bookcase, concealing the stairs — the ascent to Amari. You don’t need the password for this speakeasy; the hostess will guide the way with a simple ask. A dimly lit room with plaster walls and shuttered arched windows, Amari feels like a hidden bar in the upper confines of a rustic Italian inn. Reproductions of vintage posters of amari — plural of amaro, an Italian digestif — such as Cynar and Fernet-Branca, decorate the walls. Buy Photo \nAt AMARI Speakeasy, the bar commands the room, its shelves well-stocked, the bar well-manned. (Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean) \nThe bar commands the room, its shelves well-stocked, the bar well-manned by Wil Schultz. His cocktail menu is sophisticated, lengthy, but readily navigable, separating libations into categories: traditional — gin, vodka, rum and whiskey on one side, and trendy — agave, tiki, bubbles and mules on the other. Schultz is also in the process of introducing a Decadent Menu — cocktails for the 1 percent, or at least those feeling adventurous and flush. \nDuring happy hour, you can get half-price bottles of wine, $5 well drinks and a discounted specialty cocktail of the evening. Talk with the barkeep or server — these guys know the concoctions and can advise you well on flavor profiles and directions. If you want two drinks during your visit, start simple and finish complex. \nBlending icy lemon with honey syrup and bourbon, the Gold Rush (an evening’s special) is a good place to begin. Move on, then, to the bracing tastes of Rise N Fall, a smooth bourbon drink that gets autumn inspiration from Jamaican allspice dram, Spanish Licor 43 and orange bitters. Buy Photo \nHanky-Panky is a classic gin drink created in 1925 by head bartender Ada Coleman at London’s Savoy Hotel. Stirred with house sweet Italian vermouth and couple of dashes of Fernet Branca, it arrives chilled, a strip of orange zest in the glass. Call it a dark martini.

Stirred with house sweet Italian vermouth and couple of dashes of Fernet Branca, it arrives chilled, a strip of orange zest in the glass. Call it a dark martini. \nMore exotic is the Wreck of the Batavia. Three distinct, rarefied liqueurs go into this vodka-based concoction: Arrack van Oosten, Genepe d’Alpes and Benedictine. Take your time with heady one. \nHungry? You can order anything from the Savarino menu, and you can never go wrong with the sandwiches. We had forgotten how excellent, and generously filled they are. If the combination of grilled chicken breast and peppers, prosciutto, mozzarella and marinara suits you, then happily order The Rose Palermo. Eggplant lovers, go for the Stevie B. Asiago, broccoli rabe, romaine, tomatoes and a wowza Calabrese hot sauce accompany breaded, fried discs, all tucked between a soft Italian roll.

He enlisted the help of his brother, Konrad Haehn, a winemaker at Von Schleinitz estate in Germany’s Mosel Valley. Konrad Haehn has created five wines specifically for the Nashville market. Proceeds from the sales will benefit Room in the Inn and Safe Haven. Thomas calls this the FOH Nashville Project — Feed our Homeless. \nRieslings are not as known, and tend to be misunderstood, and underrated. (One dimensional! Too sweet!) Haehn’s wines will challenge those misconceptions. We attended a tasting at Miel a few weeks ago, and were impressed with the crisp fruit and minerality of the Von Schleinitz vintages. The Dry Riesling and Dry Pinot Noir Rose, both labeled “underdogs,” were exceptional, a far cry from the cloying wines we’ve had in the past. As we enter the time of holidays and generosity, consider these wines to purchase and serve in your home, or give as gifts. Visit the website http://www.highdef-wines.com/The_FOH_Nashville_project/ for the list of where to find the wines. \n​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:15:20.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
