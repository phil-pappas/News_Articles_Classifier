Some of the stories, such as the genesis of “Blackbird” (he wanted to send a message of encouragement to black Americans fighting for civil rights in America) are familiar from his 2011 Comerica Park concert, and indeed, the format of the show — more than 30 short-ish songs — the band and McCartney’s own look (simple dark-blue jacket and pants over white shirt) was much the same.\nThe cheeky humor some of us first got to see in 1963-64 was in full effect.\n“You might wonder why we keep switching around all the guitars,” he said at one point. “It’s because we’ve got them and we’re showing off.”\nThe crowd roared.\nMcCartney’s band was tight in 2011 and the ensuing four years has only made them better. The band sings behind him seamlessly, giving a Beatlesque sheen to the ’60s material, much as Brian Wilson’s backing singers replicate the Beach Boys’ rich vocal mix.\nAnd it’s something for them to play music as different as “Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite” (featuring a wonderfully trippy light show) from “Sgt. Pepper,” and “Band on the Run,” from his Wings years. When Brian Ray breaks into George Harrison’s solo in “Something,” it was hard not to gasp, and the audience reacted instantly. (The rest of the band — keyboard player Paul “Wix” Wickens, guitarist Rusty Anderson and drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. — also deserve mention).\n“Thank you,” McCartney said to the applause. “And thank you to George for writing such a beautiful song.”\nThe energy on the Wings rockers such as “Live and Let Die” and “Band on the Run” was palpable, making one wonder what would happen if he did a tour of all Wings material. Why not? Drop “Uncle Albert” into the mix and step back.\nIt would be nice to see him stretch out a bit on some of the numbers, and maybe drop some (such as the song he wrote for a videogame, “Hope for the Future,” or perhaps “All Together Now,” the Beatles’ kids song). Then again, the show is so tightly formatted, with intricate video displays of photos and video, that it must be difficult to change anything.\nThe photos and video deserve a mention, as they are cleverly edited to go from still photos to film. So after looking at the famous “Band on the Run” photo for much of the song, suddenly the band members are moving, adjusting themselves, laughing.\nMcCartney’s voice isn’t the pure instrument of his youth, but it’s a deeper, more emotional tool now. It fits, as he’s not the feckless youth of 1963. When he sings “Here Today,” the song he wrote as a conversation he didn’t have in time, before John Lennon died, he expresses the love for his boyhood friend that would have been scoffed at when they were young.\nswhitall@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/swhitall\nSet list \nEight Days a Week\nSave Us\nGot to Get You Into My Life\nOne After 909\nTemporary Secretary\nLet Me Roll It\nPaperback Writer\nMy Valentine\nNineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five\nThe Long and Winding Road\nMaybe I’m Amazed\nI’ve Just Seen a Face\nFourFiveSeconds\nWe Can Work It Out\nAnother Day\nHope for the Future (from the Destiny videogame)\nAnd I Love Her\nBlackbird\nHere Today\nNew\nQueenie Eye\nLady Madonna\nAll Together Now\nLovely Rita\nEleanor Rigby\nBeing for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\nSomething\nOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\nBand on the Run\nBack in the U.S.S.R.\nLet It Be\nLive and Let Die\nHey Jude\nEncore 1\nAnother Girl\nBirthday\nI Saw Her Standing There\nEncore 2\nYesterday\nHelter Skelter\nGolden Slumbers\nCarry That Weight\nThe End", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:19:57.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
