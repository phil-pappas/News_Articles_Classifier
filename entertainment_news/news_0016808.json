The film got rave reviews from all quarters with most reviewers calling it the Best film of the year. And the film is performing strong at the box office too. It opened with a collection Rs 3 crore which includes 50 lakhs from paid previews of Thursday night.\nBut here's the best part about its box office performance - this is the first that a film has shown growth on its next day and subsequent day after releasing on a major national holiday. Normally, all films drop the day after and fail to match the collections of a national holiday on any other day as well.\nTalvar has gone on to smash this trajectory by colleting, Paid Previews - Rs 50 lac, Friday - Rs 2.50 cr, Saturday - Rs 2.75 cr, Sunday - Rs 3.50 cr, Total - Rs 9.25 cr\nPaid Previews Rs 50 lakh Day 1 Rs 2.50 crore Day 2 Rs 2.75 crore Day 3 Rs 3.50 crore Total Rs 9.25 crore\nThe film has done extremely well in international markets as well. In key territories like USA, Canada, UAE, the collections of the film have doubled on the second day! The overseas gross weekend collections are approx $350,000.\nThese box office numbers are fantastic for a film that was made on a tight budget of Rs 16 crore which includes cost of production and p & a.\nThe makers of Talvar are now hoping that this trend will continue as the reviews have been amazingly well from all quarters and there is immense curiosity in the audience about the film. The film looks set to have a long run at the box office as there is no big release for next few weeks.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:05:57.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
