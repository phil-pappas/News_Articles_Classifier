There's no question bosses work the lads hard, but the financial rewards are astonishing. \n\"The band get very well paid, so they can hardly complain. They are easily Syco's biggest success story.\" \nOne Direction made an overall profit of £35 million with their company 1D Media last year and although Zayn Malik abandoned bandmates Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson in favour of a solo career earlier this year, he too gets an equal amount having only quit the band in March. \nHowever, despite their impressive earnings, the boys have decided to go on hiatus next year after releasing five albums and embarking on four tours in just five years. bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:20:39.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
