Epstein grew disgusted with his boss and decided to quit his dream job as Red Sox general manager.\nThe media didn't realize at the time that Epstein had dressed up in a gorilla suit and gotten away in a car to escape the throng of reporters waiting for a comment.\nThe Boston Globe reported the next day that \"issues of respect and control between Epstein and CEO/president Larry Lucchino could not be overcome, ultimately leading Epstein, 31, to reject the club's three-year, $4.5 million offer and give up what might well have been the only job he ever wanted.\"\nOf course, Epstein eventually returned that winter and won another title in Boston before making a more conventional exit after a Red Sox collapse in 2011.\nFunny, how life works.\nTen years after the gorilla suit episode, Epstein probably will be trick-or-treating with his kids in his North Side neighborhood, happier than ever in a job he probably never envisioned for himself in 2005. His Cubs were one of the best stories of the 2015 season, even after a brutal sweep at the hands of the Mets this week in the National League Championship Series.\nA wave of rookies vaulted the Cubs to the NLCS and validated the team's mission for sustained success. Their sooner-than-expected arrival may come at the expense of free agents or a glut of young infielders who may be used as trade chips to address much-needed impact pitching. Here's a look at the Cubs roster and their projected futures, via the Tribune's Mark Gonzales.\nNow the question isn't whether Epstein will remain as Cubs' president, but how much Chairman Tom Ricketts will have to pay him. Negotiations over an extension are expected this offseason, and the starting point is probably $35 million over five years, which is what Andrew Friedman received after bolting from the Rays to head up the Dodgers' baseball operations.\nEpstein said Thursday at his annual end-of-the-season post-mortem that he hasn't thought about it since the last time the media asked him about it last month.\n\"Anyone's individual returns are not nearly as important as the organization's as a whole and the team on the field and what we're trying to do,\" he said. \"So that is not anywhere near the top of the list of priorities this winter.\n\"But I'm sure this winter at some point we'll sit down and talk, not just about me, but about a lot of the guys in the front office who contribute behind the scenes, making sure this group can stay together for a while and finish what we started. But it's not something that's at the top of (the list).\"\nRicketts has no leverage, unlike an arbitration hearing in which you can point to a players' numbers with runners in scoring position. It should be a brief negotiation, starting with the question: \"How much?\"\nEpstein loves running the Cubs. He called it an \"emotional clubhouse\" after Wednesday's loss because the organization is \"the most together, connected, team-first organization I've seen in a long time.\"\n\"No one was trying to grab any credit or deflect any blame,\" he said. \"They all supported one another, and in the end the whole was greater than the sum of the parts. That's magical, and that's to be coveted and appreciated. The problem is you can't bottle it.\"\nIf the Cubs could bottle it, they probably would sell naming rights to the bottle. That's the new reality of Wrigley Field, where the pursuit of revenue streams is going to make it a different ballpark experience in the coming years, with more ad signage and more sponsors.\nThe new clubhouse also will be opening in 2016, theoretically to make the players more relaxed.\nIn the end, the Cubs should be in good position to make a playoff run for years. Once you get in, it's a crapshoot, as the Dodgers have learned over and over again.\nJust how much money Epstein will get to spend in 2016 remains to be seen, though he said he would look for \"impact\" pitching, which suggests someone like David Price or Zack Greinke.\nThe 2016 budget hasn't been finalized, Epstein said, though he admitted the playoff revenue and attendance increase should bolster the payroll. The big boost will come after 2019 with a new TV contract.\n\"We've talked about someday being must-see TV and a really entertaining product,\" he said. \"We just don't know exactly what those numbers are. â€¦ Obviously the 2016 payroll is not going to be as big as the 2010 payroll because of the (current) TV deal and everything else. But what the team accomplished this year should help and we all should have an aggressive mindset.\"\nEpstein will get a little downtime as he awaits the general managers meetings in a couple of weeks in Boca Raton, Fla.\nSo if you see a happy gorilla standing at your doorstep on Halloween, give him an extra Snickers bar.\nHe has earned it.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Theo Epstein Chicago Cubs Boston Red Sox Zack Greinke Tom Ricketts Los Angeles Dodgers David Price", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56291ef7/turbine/ct-cubs-roster-outlook-photos-20151022", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56297243/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-spt-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:19:06.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
