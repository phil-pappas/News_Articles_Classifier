(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) LAS VEGAS (FOX5/AP) - \nA toxicology report on former NBA player Lamar Odom could take several weeks to complete after he was found unresponsive inside a brothel near Pahrump. \nThe Nye County Sheriff's Office held a news conference Wednesday, a day after the former reality television star was rushed to the hospital from Dennis Hof's Bunny Ranch Tuesday afternoon. \nAccording to the Nye County Sheriff’s Office, an ambulance was called to Dennis Hof’s Bunny Ranch about 3:15 p.m. Tuesday, after Odom was found unconscious there with blood coming from his nose and mouth. He was stabilized at a local hospital, and then taken to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, about 70 miles away. He had to be taken by ground because he was too tall to fit in an air ambulance. \nAccording to Sheriff Sharon Wehrly, Odom took a sexual performance enhancer, which Hof confirmed was a sort of herbal Viagra. \nA 911 recording from Tuesday was also played during the news conference which elaborated a white substance was coming out of Odom's nose and mouth. \nHof told MORE that Odom arrived at the ranch on Saturday and was drinking and partying with the women at the brothel. On Tuesday, Odom went to sleep about 6 a.m. About 3:15 p.m. the women went in to check on Odom and found him unresponsive. \n“We called 911 and they said, ‘Get him on his left side,’” Hof said. “He started throwing up a lot of terrible stuff.” \nHof said he doesn’t believe Odom was taking any illegal drugs, but he believes he was taking a lot of the sexual performance enhancers, which might be the problem. In a later interview with MORE, Hof said that Odom told the women working at the brothel that he had been doing cocaine before he arrived at the ranch. \nWehrly later said the sexual supplements are legal. \nThe sheriff's office, though, said if cocaine is found in Odom's system, a drug possession charge against him may be possible. A warrant was obtained for a blood draw from Odom for the toxicology test. \nThere was no immediate word on Odom’s condition. However, Rev. Jesse Jackson talked to reporters outside the hospital after leaving Odom’s bedside. He said Odom was in a coma and on life-support, but was moving and coughing. \n“He’s not talking,” Jackson said. “Tubes are in him now, but we felt inspired by his presence and we just had prayer.” \nAccording to TMZ , Odom’s ex-wife, Khloe Kardashian, has been by his side since Tuesday night. The website also reported that former teammate Kobe Bryant left a preseason game of the Los Angeles Lakers being played in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to be by Odom’s side. \nOdom has played for both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers, as well as the Miami Heat and the Dallas Mavericks. \nThe 35-year-old retired from the NBA in 2013 and saw reality TV fame through his four-year marriage to Kardashian. \nCopyright 2015 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation).
