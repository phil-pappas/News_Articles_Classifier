As Rochester Philharmonic's music director, he demands precision. In rehearsal, I've heard him politely admonish musicians seated toward the back of a section to beef up their focus, to play as precisely as possible. And that attention to detail has paid off. It has created, already, an orchestra that is tighter and more limber. Whatever you might make of Stare in his first full season leading the RPO, one of his beloved predecessors, Christopher Seaman, is still your favorite uncle who visits once a year and brings lovable jokes and armloads of bonbons. Exquisite bonbons, of course.\nAs conductor laureate of the RPO, Seaman returns annually. He took the podium Thursday night at Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre in a program that will be performed again Saturday night.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nChristopher Seaman's RPO homecoming\nSeaman, who led the RPO from 1998 to 2011, started the evening with Debussy's \"Iberia,\" No. 2 from Images . It's a dreamy homage to Spain, complete with crazy castanets and strings occasionally playing a jaunty guitar-style pizzicato. The work, which Debussy wrote between 1903 and 1910, is very visual, painting images of streets and byways in the first movement, a festival day in the last movement.\nBut throughout \"Iberia,\" the orchestra was not as cohesive as it has been. In music as in painting, pointillism is a fascinating technique. But you can't do it halfway. It must be executed with precision, or the final image isn't as powerful as it could be.\nMozart's Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat Major, K. 482, started out much the same. It's a happy and familiar work — I caught myself absent-mindedly air-conducting early on — but it just didn't have the spot-on attack it deserves.\nSoloist Christopher O'Riley did. The host of NPR's youth-musician show From the Top gave a masterful performance. Over and over, O'Riley delivered delicious Niagaras of sound. He looked as if he was just about to tell a joke, and then he would rip into another killer cadenza. It's an alternately raucous and delicate work, and O'Riley owned it.\nROCHESTER ARTS\nPianist and NPR host Christopher O'Riley visits RPO this week\nThe orchestra further underscored the evening of pointillism with delightful passages but blurred edges. But by the third movement, the segues between piano and orchestra were seamless, with especially great interplay between the piano and French horn. O'Riley soared above, thoughtfully and effortlessly, a splash of Grand Marnier to the orchestra's party punch.\nThe evening really coalesced in the second half of the program. Brahms' Symphony No. 4 in E Minor, Op. 98, begins in a big, beautiful and comforting way, and the orchestra delivered in grand and fabulous fashion. The arguing themes give way to a carousel of imagery, swirling between sections of the orchestra. It's moody, contemplative and magical. The mesmerizing work between the string sections drove home the first movement.\nBrahms' sense of logic is apparent in the second movement. It's balanced and fair, with smooth handoffs from clarinet to horn to bassoon, underscored by an evocative pizzicato. The dueling arpeggios between the violins and the cellos and violas were lyrical and satisfying. When the French horns nailed it midway through the movement, the orchestra rallied to new heights, playing with soothing yet powerful precision. It was quintessential Brahms. As Maestro Seaman said in his pre-concert remarks: the perfect blending of head and heart.\nBy the jocular third movement, the allegro giocoso, the orchestra's precision was back. The attack that was lacking earlier in the evening re-emerged in an invigorating way, particularly as the violas took on the lowly triangle in one effervescent passage. The frenetic fourth movement — allegro energico e passionato — is irresistible. There's a sense of impending craziness, a little psychotic at times, that's tempered by a sweeping awesomeness in the strings. But it all leads to a powerful and inspiring conclusion, which the orchestra delivered with great cohesion.\nIn the end, Maestro Seaman's return to Rochester was rewarding and exciting. It's nice to be spoiled by your favorite uncle once in a while.\nJann Nyffeler, a Rochester-based freelance journalist, is a recovering violinist who began her classical music career at WCPE-FM in North Carolina.\nIf You Go\nWhat: The Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Christopher Seaman,\nWhere: Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre, 26 Gibbs St, Rochester,\nWhen: 8 p.m. Saturday.\nTickets: $22-114. www.rpo.org , 585-454-2100, at Wegmans That's T.H.E.
