When he was getting treatment, he found out he had been dropped from his insurance – leaving him with hefty medical bills. \nBut thanks to the support of the Denver music scene, Richmond, who had to cancel his appearance playing in Tennis' national tour opening for Shakey Graves, is on his way to getting back on his feet (literally). \n\"I just can't even believe all of the people that have come out to support me in this time … and I'm just incredibly grateful,\" Richmond said. \nAs of Tuesday evening, friends and strangers had donated almost $15,000 to a GoFundMe page set up by Richmond's girlfriend . Wednesday night, they'll gather at Syntax Physic Opera on South Broadway from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. for a fundraiser in his honor. \n\"I definitely want to come out and see the few people that support me,\" Richmond said, admitting that because of his injury, he doesn't know how long he'll stay out. \n\"My friends and the music community have been pretty incredible and helpful in this time, where I'm just kind of hard up, and realizing that this is going to be a big uphill battle,\" he said. \nRichmond has called the entire experience \"incredibly humbling.\" \n\"I realize everyone has their own things, and life happens to everybody,\" he said. \"Just the fact that they care to take the time and energy to help out – it's incredible.\" \n(© 2015 KUSA) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1LJI9pO More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:30:35.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
