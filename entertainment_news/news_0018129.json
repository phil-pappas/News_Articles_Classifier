Columbus Blvd) upcoming season. From in-progress showcases to late-night parties, every type of arts appreciator will find a reason to hit the performance space. \n\nSee a show \nFringeArts has curated a lineup of programming that you won’t be able to catch anywhere else. \nImagine Chopin’s concertos without a piano. Now picture an actress performing monologues in the piano’s place. In “ Chopin Without Piano ,” actor Barbara Wyocka sits atop the piano and performs a spoken piece inspired by the composer himself. Showtimes are 8 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 28, Thursday, Oct. 29 and Friday, Oct. 30 and 2 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 31 . \nYou’ve also got a world-class dance performance at 8 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 1 , set to Bach’s compositions, that celebrates the dancers’ own appreciation of their art form. Choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, for the first time, composed this duet for herself and partner, Boris Charmatz. \nA two-part series, “Age & Beauty” begins with a dance duet that explores the outward reception of dancers — especially aging ones — the creation of art and the burnout that comes along with it. Part I hits the stage at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 10 and Wednesday, Nov. 11 . Part II follows up on Friday, Nov. 13 and Saturday, Nov. 14 at 8 p.m. and deals with the complex relationships and factors — like money — in the realm of choreography. \nDrawing on inspiration from the neighborhood in which their dance studio is located — South 9th St. — Kun-Yang Lin/Dancers take immigrant stories and display them in choreographed movements. “Home/S. 9th Street” opens at 8 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 19 and continues at 8 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 20 and 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 21 . \nThe latest in a performance series about medieval nuns, this one “ Abbot Adam: None ,” focuses on the nighttime hours after the workday is done, how one spends their time and reflects on the day. The show runs Thursday, Dec. 10, Friday, Dec. 11 (8 p.m.) and Saturday, Dec. 12 (7 p.m. and 10 p.m.). \nAs always, the first Monday of the month features a showcase of local artists testing out new works on an always-eager audience. This fall’s Scratch Nights are at 8 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 2 and Monday, Dec. 7 . \n\nStay out late \nCharan Po Rantan , sisters from Japan, Koharu (she plays accordion) and Momo (she’s the singer) grace the La Peg stage for upbeat pop with influences from the unexpected. (Think circus and gypsy music.) It’ll be a high-powered 10:30 p.m. show on Friday, Oct. 30 . \nLa Peg knows how to party. The brasserie at FringeArts opens its doors for a 10:30 p.m. performance from funky R&B outfit Red 40 and the Last Groovement on Friday, Nov. 6 . \n\nHear a tune \nA collection of guitar virtuosos, led by conductor composer Adam Rudolph, the Organic Guitar Orchestra will take the oft-heard instrument and create broad and unique compositions, putting a fun twist on the tried and true. Catch the group at 8 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 22 . \nFor more Things to Do, check out our calendar for the most up-to-date happenings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:57:58.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
