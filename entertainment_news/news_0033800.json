What a knob\nâ€” David Hollywood (@dw00dz) September 26, 2015 According to Mashable , \"a tipsy-to-drunk Swift stroked his signature hair for about 15 minutes while he was sober\" at a Grammy after party.\nSpeaking via Rolling Stone , Abel Tesfaye said: \"But the whole time she was talking.... She was kind of, like, petting my hair? I think she was just drawn to it - she must have been a little gone off a few drinks. And of course I'm not going to be like, 'Hey, can you stop?' I mean, it felt good! But when she started petting my hair, that's when I was like, 'I definitely need a drink.'\"\nThe experience didn't put Tesfaye off hanging out with Swift, as he performed onstage with her during her 1989 tour in July, and here he is getting on down with her and her \"squad\" back in August. And that's not Lucy Beale, it just looks like her.\nMORE: Graham Norton is back!
