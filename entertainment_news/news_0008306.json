A transformer. A midlife crisis.\nWhatever you call it, the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports coupe with scissor doors was the most talked about car in the neighborhood. Kids pointed, adults scoffed and people took pictures of this futuristic-looking supercar out of central casting in the inevitable \"Blade Runner\" reboot.\nBut if BMW's technology showcase portends the future of autos, then I'll pass.\nThe i8 is overpriced, impractical and outgunned by other performance vehicles.\nOn the upside, it looks like no other car on the road. It has a supercar profile, low to the ground with a wide wheelbase and narrow nose flowing back into a muscular rear.\nThe difference is in the air flow. It's not studded with air vents; rather, chutes and scoops provide the kind of aerodynamics that lets air travel through it as much as over it.\nThe aluminum hood might be the most familiar part, with a central vent reminiscent of the Corvette. While the Vette's vent is flush with the hood, the i8 dips into a kind of V-shaped recess. The air runs over the raked windshield down the sides to a chute between the rear wheels and the deck lid, or hatch. Whatever you call it, the rear lid appears to be floating. Those chutes then spill out between U-shaped LED taillights.\n2015 BMW i3 plug-in car is an odd duck Robert Duffer Odd.\nOdd is a word that depends on context for meaning. Odd choice? Questionable.

BMW i3.\nBMW made an odd choice with its oddball electric car. Nearly everyone who had anything to say about the odd-duck compact called it odd. Some used odd as in ugly dumb when comparing...\n(Robert Duffer) The lighting is balanced in the front too, where U-shaped daytime running lights frame squinty-eyed, predatorial adaptive headlights. The car is a bird of prey grounded by 20-inch alloy wheels.\nMost people ran their hands along the body and peered down the chute, marveling at the art house novelty and gorgeous execution. But the most visually impressive stance is with the deck lid up and the scissor doors open to the sky. It looks like a Star Wars Imperial Shuttle morphing into a falcon ready to nose-dive. It's the kind of cool car geeks drew in their notebooks in middle school. Or tried to.\nThe scissor doors — hinged at the front but opening out and up, like the door is doing a keg stand to the hinge — are tricky to negotiate. To open it, the hand reaches into a nook behind the door — nothing protrudes from the side. Once open, the interior handles help you get into the most difficult ingress this side of an Alfa Romeo 4C. The sill is about a foot wide, and best negotiated by sitting on the sill with feet on the concrete, then sliding back into the driver's seat and swinging the legs in. A dive bomb works too, if you're smaller.\nTesla Model S P85D: The D is like nothing else on the road Robert Duffer Certain experiences promise a thrill: roller coasters, free fall, love. Add The D to the list.\nTesla's Model S P85D, the all-wheel-drive variant of the all-electric Model S, is like no other car on the road. I say this without hyperbole or overstatement.

The D goes 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds, making...\n(Robert Duffer) Adults can reach the door handles from a sitting position, but the kids had a tough time. Yes, there are rear seats. There is a 2x2 seating configuration but there is no way anyone can fit behind the driver's seat. It might just be an insurance play. Or a place for golf clubs because the trunk is the size of a tool box, replete with a plug-in charger.\nThere are no door handles to get out, rather a button that opens the doors.\nOnce nestled in the cabin, it's quite comfy, though the biggest people may find a challenge with hip and headroom.\nThe i8 is a contrast of opposing forces, a supercar made of lightweight materials meant to optimize fuel economy. The frame is made of aluminum, the tub is made of carbon fiber and the accent strips on the interior are made of recycled materials. Even the key fob is partly made from castor beans.\nYet fine light gray leather swaddles the seats, door panels and center consoles. Indulgences such as a bespoke sports steering wheel and BMW's head-up display, a lower windshield projection of vehicle information so you're eyes never stray from the road, is the clearest on the market. And the design screams speed.\nAt nearly $140,000, the selling point greater than the eco-mindedness of the i8 is the advanced powertrain.\nThe source of gas power is a direct-injection 1.5-liter turbo 3-cylinder engine with variable valve timing. Those three cylinders make an impressive 228 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque driving the rear wheels. Ford's 1-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine, which has been lauded as the future as well, generates 123 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. It's a honey crisp to red delicious comparison.\nThe i8 is also propelled by an electric motor making up to 129 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque at the front wheels.\nThe power plant as a whole makes 357 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque.\nAs far as sports coupes go, its performance is not mind-blowing. It has the sudden pickup of electric cars, where the max torque is ever-present. From a stop it can lift you out of your seat and throw you back, but the Tesla Model S on the electric side, and the Chevy Corvette on the gas side, do it much better.\nBut the i8 offers choices with its four driving modes. All-electric mode, signified as eDrive or creeper mode, offers a great initial burst before topping out in a middling range not unlike other all-electric cars. The all-electric range is only 13 miles, top speed is limited to 75 mph, but the regen braking helps recapture enough battery power to always have a little juice, even if you don't need it. It's the only setting with its own button, which is terribly placed below the start/stop button on the center console.\nComfort mode, or default mode, responds to inputs by staying in electric at low throttle and switching to gas at harder throttle, and using both at highway speeds. Eco Pro mode is a more mindful version of Comfort, minimizing power drains from other sources such as the air conditioning or heated seats.\nThe i8 is remarkably stealthy for a car that is so flashy.\nUntil you notch the gear stick into sport mode.\nThe dash lighting goes from cool blue to hot red. The three-cylinder engine begins to bark, and when the gas is hit it amplifies a strange but lovely melody of a warbling gas engine mixed with a turbo whir, all underscored by the thrum of the electric motor. It is sonorous. It is the sound of the future.\nPlug-in hybrids are the only reasonable way automakers will reach CAFE requirements. Consumers like being able to fill your tank, so to speak, in your garage overnight, as well as the fun-to-drive factor of plug-ins.\nThe plug-in price premium is less popular. Still, BMW has announced that every model will come with a plug-in variant, likely by 2020. The X5 SUV plug-in hybrid will be at dealers before the end of 2015.\nThe i8 is more impressive from an intellectual than performance standpoint. There's no doubt BMW has the capability to make a plug-in performance beast, but the i8 is not it. It is more a halo car for its electrification program and, while undeniably cool, leaves $140,000 a bit unfulfilled.\nInstead of the Batmobile, let's call it the future, where there's always room for improvement.\nrduffer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DufferRobert\n2015 BMW i8 at a glance\nVehicle type: Plug-in hybrid sports coupe\nBase price: $136,500\nAs tested: $139,500 (excluding $995 destination)\nMPG: 28 mpg gas only combined, 76 miles gas and electric\nEngine: 1.5-liter turbo 3-cylinder with direct injection, paired to 129-horsepower electric motor\nTransmission: 6-speed automatic gas only; 2-speed automatic in electric only\nParting shot: Stunning technological showcase looks far better than it performs\n Electric and Hybrid Vehicles BMW Exotic and Classic Cars", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e9b22a/turbine/sc-cons-0910-autoreview-bmw-i3-20150903", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562acf42/turbine/sc-bmw-i8-autoreview-1029-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54eb52e1/turbine/sc-cons-0219-autocover-tesla-the-d-20150217"], "published": "2015-10-26T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:08:32.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
