And she only makes her appearance halfway through the episode. Enough time, though for a foursome that turns into a brutal double murder though, of course.\nAdvertisement Appearing on US talk show  Jimmy Fallon last week, Gaga said she had long been a horror fan.\n\"Dangerous things and horror movies are relaxing to me,\" she said. \"I like watching slasher films - it calms me down!\"\nThe Countess in full flight. \nShe said she was \"acquainted\" with the art of darkness.\n\"I know it's not for everyone. I imagine I would've been one of Hitchcock's groupies. I love it so much - that dichotomy of sex and horror at the same time - there's something fascinating in that.\"\nAlso starring Sarah Paulson as a junkie prostitute, Kathy Bates as the hotel receptionist and Dennis O'Hare as 'Liz Taylor', a cross-dressing bellhop, the new American Horror Story will also feature a slew of celebrity guest stars including Michelle Pfeiffer, Alexander Skasgard and Naomi Campbell.\nThe there are all the other murderous subplots this season, including the Ten Commandments Killer and The Addiction Demon (no, really), who roams the hotel armed with a drill-bit dildo.\nEven though she uttered only a handful of lines in the series opener, it's clear Gaga and AHS are a perfect match.\nAmerican Horror Story airs on Eleven on Mondays at 9:30 and on TenPlay .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:27:31.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
