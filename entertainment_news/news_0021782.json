The comedian, who is recovering from a car crash that almost took his life last year, announced Tuesday that he's set to go on a six-date stand-up comedy tour in 2016. \nThe Tracy Morgan: Picking Up the Pieces Tour comes after Morgan's return to the small screen by appearing at the Emmy Awards last month and hosting Saturday Night Live last weekend. \nIn a statement, Morgan said he's not worried about returning to the stage. \"It’s just like falling off a bike and getting back on, that’s all: you don’t forget where the pedals are. People can expect more of what I did before. It’s me: funny truth = Tracy Morgan. I can’t wait to get back to ya’ll; city to city, state to state, watch me operate.\" \nThe tour will kick off in Hammond, Indiana's The Venue at Horseshoe on February 5, 2016 and will end May 20, 2016 at Riverdome at Horseshoe Casino & Hotel in Bossier City, Louisiana. The comedian also will stop at Windsor, Ontario, Canada; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Cherokee, North Carolina; and Robinsonville, Mississippi‎. \nTickets go on sale via Ticketmaster.com on Friday, October 30. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
