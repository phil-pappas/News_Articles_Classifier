Now, she’s seeking help to overcome it. \n“Hayden Panettiere is voluntarily seeking professional help at a treatment center as she is currently battling postpartum depression,\" her rep confirms in a statement. \"She asks that the media respect her privacy during this time.” \nDuring an appearance on Live! with Kelly and Michael last month, Hayden addressed her struggles. \n“It's something a lot of women experience. When [you’re told] about postpartum depression you think it’s ‘I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child.' I’ve never, ever had those feelings,\" she said. \"Some women do. But you don’t realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It’s something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they’re not alone, and that it does heal.\" \nHayden’s character on Nashville , Juliette Barnes, is also suffering from postpartum depression on the show. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
