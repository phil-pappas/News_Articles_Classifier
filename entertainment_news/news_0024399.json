Lorenzo Ligato Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/20/2015 07:18 AM EDT | Edited: 27 minutes ago ADVERTISEMENT \nSnapchat has found yet another way to get us addicted: trophies. \nSnapchat debuted a \"Trophy Case\" in its latest major upgrade in September. The feature allows users to win trophies for every major -- and not-so-major -- milestone they reach on Snapchat, from hitting a certain \"Snapchat score\" to sending their first video snap. \nYou can access your trophy case by tapping the white ghost icon on Snapchat's camera screen, and then clicking on the trophy at the top of the profile screen. You'll see a collection of emoji-style icons: Some of the trophies may be unlocked (for instance, you may see 📼 or👆), meaning you've completed the associated task. The awards that are still unlocked are aptly signaled by the🔒 emoji. One item in the case may correspond to multiple trophies. \nHere's my trophy case, for example: Snapchat via Lorenzo Ligato \nSo how do you fill up your case? Well, the difficulty is that \"there is no public list of trophies,\" as Snapchat writes in its guidelines . \n\"The more you explore Snapchat, the more opportunities you’ll have to earn trophies. For example, if you reach a high enough Snapchat score, or send a certain number of stories from Discover, you might earn a trophy,\" the guidelines explain. \nIt's pretty vague, but that's part of the fun: figuring out how to unlock them or chancing upon a new trophy while trying out one of Snapchat's many filters and features. \nSpoiler alert: If you genuinely relish the challenge of discovering new trophies on your own, don't read any further. But if you need a little help filling up that case, we've compiled an unofficial list of Snapchat trophies, complete with instructions on how to unlock each achievement. Some of the tasks may seem pretty intuitive; others, however, are a little more obscure. The list appears to be exhaustive based on the number of trophies in the case, although Snapchat hasn't stated how many trophies there are. \nConsider this your personal cheat sheet to achieve Snapchat stardom. \nSnapchat Score Trophies: \n👶 Baby: Your Snapchat score hit 100. \n🌟 Glowing star: Your score hit 500. \n✨ Sparkles: Your score hit 1,000. \n💫 Shooting star: Your score hit 10,000. \n💥 Collision symbol: Your score hit 50,000. \n🚀 Rocket ship : Your score hit 100,000. \n👻 Ghost: Your score hit 500,000. \nFilter Trophies: \n👆 Finger pointing up: Send a snap with a filter applied. \nPeace sign : Send a snap with two filters applied. \n🐼 Panda: Send 50 snaps using the black and white filter. \nSnowflake: Send a snap with the temperature filter showing it's below freezing. \n🌞 Sun with face: Send a snap with the filter showing it's above 100° F. \n\n'Draw On Your Snaps' Trophies: \n🍭 Lollipop: Send a snap using five or more pen colors. \n🌈 Rainbow: Send 10 snaps using five or more pen colors. \n🎨 Palette: Send 50 snaps using five or more pen colors. \n\n📼 Videocassette tape: Send a video snap. \n🎥 Old-school movie camera: Send 50 video snaps. \n📹 Digital video camera: Send 500 video snaps. \n🙉 Monkey holding ears: Send a video snap without sound. \n🔂 Loop once: Flip the camera once in a video snap. \n🔁 Loop: Flip the camera five times in a video snap. \n🔄 Refresh icon: Flip the camera ten times in a video snap. \n\n🔦 Flashlight: Send 10 snaps with your front-facing flash on. \n🌜 Half-moon face: Send 50 snaps in night mode. \n👹 Japanese ogre: Send 1,000 selfies. \n🔍 Magnifying glass: Send 10 photo snaps entirely zoomed in. \n🔬 Microscope: Send 10 video snaps using zoom. \n🔠 ABCD: Send 100 snaps with enlarged text font. \n🍳 Egg in a frying pan: Send a snap between 4 and 5 a.m. ___ Lorenzo Ligato covers technology and Internet culture, and is based in New York.
