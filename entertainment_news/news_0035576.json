Get ready to see more video content on Facebook.\nFacebook announced Tuesday that it's introducing a new video channel tab to users' homepage, where they can watch videos posted by friends, companies and celebrities they follow. The new tab seems to replace the Messenger icon on mobile.\n\"Video has continued to grow on Facebook,\" Will Cathcart, vice president of Product Management, wrote in a blog post. \"It has become an integral part of how people around the world discover, watch and share videos they care about every day.\"\nfacebook Facebook is testing a new video tab that replaces the Messenger icon. Along with the new dedicated video channel, Facebook is also introducing a \"save\" button and a floating video screen that allows people to multitask. Users will be able to watch a video while scrolling through their News Feed. If they want to watch the video at a later time, then they can just bookmark it by tapping on the \"Save\" icon.\nFacebook's new video channel is designed to compete with other video platforms such as YouTube. Especially since Facebook's video traffic has grown popular over the past year and it is now sharing ad revenue with its video creators. More than four billion videos are being watched a day, according to the social network.\nFacebook has also been experimenting with 360 degree videos, which will eventually help introduce the company's virtual reality initiative with Oculus.\nRelated Stories Facebook now lets users filter out bad memories Facebook starts testing emoji reactions, no 'Dislike' button", "external_links": ["http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/10/testing-new-video-experiences/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:10:03.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
