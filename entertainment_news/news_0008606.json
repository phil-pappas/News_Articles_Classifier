Australian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman said the digital age was moving faster than ever. And to survive, retailers have to rethink their marketing strategy and the ­talent they use: “We have now moved to online and retail is evolving all the time.\n“We’re seeing a whole lot of digital advertising that a few years ago would have been done through TV and magazines. New talent in the mix adds diversification and shoppers have affinity with high-profile names.’’\nSince South Africa’s Woolworths Holdings’ $2.2 billion takeover of David Jones last year the store has removed 180 brands and had 6.4 per cent increase in sales to $1.9 billion in the six months to June 30.\nOther Stories What’s the Buzz: Saint, sinner, shoosh Nrl 0 comments My lifesaving surgery is killing me Nsw 0 comments Alleged GoPro gang rapist already on bail Nsw Former NRL star ‘dragged woman down stairs’ Nsw ‘Why do sports clubs ignore victims?’ Nsw 0 comments Falconio killer ‘more like a prison guard’ Nsw Group executive for merchandise Donna Player said the campaign was a response to insights from a customer survey: “Customers were telling us to be edgy and dynamic.’’\nJessica Gomes is “Confidence”.
