Now she's all set to make a splash in Tollywood with Sudheer Babu-starrer Bhale Manchi Roju . \"I'm playing a village belle who is about to get married. Then the plot takes an unexpected twist. It's a comedy thriller that is going to leave the audiences surprised,\" shares the excited 22-year-old, who admits to have enjoyed doing the South Indian-style dance sequences in the film.\n\"I loved shaking a leg to a wedding song which is high on energy. There's another duet which was choreographed by Chinni Prakash. It was amazing working with him because he has choreographed my favourite actors Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai in Jodha Akbar,\" elaborates Wamiqa, who is set to foray into Kollywood with the soon to release Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam , directed by Selvaraghavan.\n\"On the first day of shooting I struggled with my dialogues and the director Selvaraghavan yelled at me. I was taken aback and immediately called my father and cried to him that I am coming back and my dad retorted, 'Oh, so you can't do it?' That rebuke inspired me to pull up my socks and rise up the challenge,\" she recalls.\nAdmittedly, her dad predicted that she would become an actress the day she was born. \"My father tells me that the moment he saw me open my eyes the day I was born, he knew that I'd become an actress,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:45:22.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
