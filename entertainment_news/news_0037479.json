A photo posted by King Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 20, 2015 at 11:41am PDT \nAccording to Gossip Cop , Kylie Jenner took to her app on Tuesday to answer fans’ burning questions about everything from her new home, family, beauty routine, and plans to get into acting, but there was one question in particular that Kylie neglected to respond to that has fans wondering if Jenner was dropping some not-so-subtle hints about the weed-smoking rumors that have continued to plague Kylie for months. \nDuring the Q&A segment, Kylie was joined by her two best friends, Anastasia Karanikolauo and Shamari Maurice, to answer tweeted questions from fans regarding a variety of topics. \nHowever, things appeared to get off to an awkward start after one fan asked Kylie Jenner how much weed she smokes on a daily basis, prompting Jenner to get suspiciously quiet while friends Anastasia and Shamari insisted that they were the most “anti-weed” people they know. \nAfter a brief pause, Shamari jumped in to respond to the marijuana-based question to tell Kylie’s fans, “OK, it’s so annoying because everyone thinks I smoke weed. I’m like the number one, like, not weed smoker. Like I think weed’s so stupid.” \nWhile Kylie nodded in agreement with her friend’s anti-weed smoking statement, things got even more awkward when Anastasia further replied to the fan’s weed question with, “So am I,” while Kylie merely sat silently in the background before moving on to other fan-submitted questions. \nJust moments after Kylie Jenner attempted to dodge the weed-related question, Kylie’s viewers took to Twitter to point out that Kylie mysteriously never offered her opinion on the rumors surrounding her alleged drug use. While Kylie has previously denied the drug allegations, some fans took Jenner’s lack of response as an admission that she smokes weed. \nEarlier this year, Kylie Jenner seemed to fuel the marijuana allegations after she took to Snapchat to share a video of herself eating a Popeyes biscuit before allegedly muttering, “I’m high as f***.” \nPeople reports that despite the weed speculation following her biscuit-eating Snapchat video, Kylie was quick to dispel the drug rumors by insisting that she was gushing over the food being “good as f***” and that not that she was engaging in any illicit drug use. \n“I did NOT say that,” Kylie Jenner tweeted just days after her Snapchat video made headlines. \n“I did a snapchat saying my chicken was ‘good as f***’ eating Popeyes for the 1 st time. And apparently people think I said high as f***,” Kylie continued, before sarcastically apologizing to those who believe she is a “wild child.” \nSimilarly, Kylie Jenner had to combat rumors of her and sister Khloe Kardashian’s alleged drug use earlier this year after one of her Snapchat videos allegedly showed a guest from her graduation party holding a “suspicious” container that fans interpreted to be cocaine. A video posted by Kylie Jenner Snapchats (@kylizzlesnapchats) on Jul 23, 2015 at 7:56pm PDT \nIn the video, an unidentified man appears to take something out of a small container before putting his finger into his mouth while Khloe Kardashian dances along to the music, leading some fans to speculate that there may have been cocaine present at Kylie’s grad party. \nTo defend the rumors surrounding herself and sister Kylie Jenner, Khloe lashed out at the claims on Twitter by insisting that the video in question merely showed a guest loosening the rim on a jello shot and that nobody was doing drugs of any kind during Kylie’s party. \n“No one was doing coke at a graduation party in broad day light with teenagers and 15 production cameras! We aren’t as wild as you want to believe,” Kardashian insisted, before concluding that drugs are “so not our style.” \nWhat do you think of Kylie Jenner’s decision to not respond to the weed comments during her Q&A segment? \n[Photo by Robyn Beck/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:58:20.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
