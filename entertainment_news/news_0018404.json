The basketball-themed comedic drama is filming in Chicago through Nov. 5. (Morgan D. Jensen) Nina Metz Contact Reporter Chicago Closeup Actor/rapper formerly known as Lil' Romeo plays a reluctant basketball coach in a movie filming in Chicago. \nRomeo Miller, the rapper who began his career under the name Lil’ Romeo and later went on to play point guard for the University of Southern California's basketball team for two seasons, is in Chicago co-starring in the basketball-themed indie “Game Day.” \nFilming on the dramedy, about a woman who must make her company’s all-male basketball team to save her job, began Monday, and the original script comes from director John Susman, a playwright who is also one of Steppenwolf Theatre’s past literary managers. This is his first feature-length film. He and fellow Chicagoan Stuart Wolf (a longtime film publicist) are co-producing. \n(When I had trouble finding the project on IMDb, Wolf jokingly acknowledged, \"There are nine other 'Game Day' entries. Ours is listed as 2016.\") \nThe movie, per Wolf, centers on a “woman who is a tech whiz in Chicago. Her startup collapses, and it triggers a collapse in her personal life as well. She gets a second chance and is hired at a new company, and even though she has great ideas, nobody’s paying attention. She’s not a people person; she’s self-centered. And then she realizes, if you play on the company’s all-male basketball team, the bosses pay attention. So she hires a high school kid who becomes her reluctant coach.” \nThe film stars Elizabeth Alderfer and Miller in the aforementioned roles. (Miller is the son of rapper Master P.) The cast also includes John Heard, Fyvush Finkel and Chicagoans Jerod Haynes (currently starring in “Gem of the Ocean” at Court Theatre; in his review , Trib theater critic noted that Haynes is “turning into one of the best darn actors in the city”) and Second City alum Antoine McKay. \nFilming is expected to continue through Nov. 5, and Wolf says they will need extras Oct. 29 for an extended day of shooting at the Hyde Park Children’s Club.
