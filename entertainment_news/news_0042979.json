Picture: SUPPLIED Related articles Our true type lurks between Corruptaa and Zma HALF ART: Humble Rapture keeps its feet on the ground Film and performance take centre stage at fair A fitting response to Coetzee’s epic sculptures A POP-UP shop of limited-edition artists’ prints will open in Johannesburg’s Parkview on Saturday, says organiser Ann Roberts.\nThis year’s Artists’ Press Limited Edition Print Pop Up Shop follows the success of the first one, in Linden last year.\n\"(Last year’s shop) drew a significant crowd, provided an informative and fun family outing and, along the way, caught the attention of the established art world,\" says Roberts.\n\"This flowed out of the fact that the pop-up shop attracted new art buyers who found it an accessible, immediate and welcoming way to start or add to an art collection that will retain and grow in value.\"\nWork from artists such as Judith Mason, Conrad Botes, Anton Kannemeyer, Sam Nhlengethwa, Walter Oltmann and Claudette Schreuders will be available for prices ranging from R2,500 to R12,500, says Roberts.\n\"It’s quite amazing that this empty shell is there in the morning, then people arrive and it gets filled up with art and music and food and then at 4pm it’s all packed up again,\" says Mark Attwood, owner of The Artists’ Press in White River, Mpumalanga.\nAttwood grew up in Johannesburg, leaving school at 15 to apprentice under his printer father, Bruce Attwood, who printed books, invitations and offset lithographs for artists such as Walter Battiss, Norman Catherine and Giuseppe Cattaneo.\nAt White River, Attwood and his staff use two hand presses to carefully print limited editions of art works.\n\"The artists come and spend about two weeks collaborating with us. We supply the technical backup. Then they leave the plates with us and we print up to 25 or 30, maybe 35,\" he says.\nAttwood studied the method at the University of Mexico’s Tamarind Institute and ran a printing business in Johannesburg for 11 years before relocating to White River three years ago.\n\"There aren’t a lot of us (making prints of artists’ work) in SA. We all work with different artists and our work is complementary. Sometimes we work together,\" he says.\n• Artists’ Press Limited Edition Print Pop Up Shop, October 3, The Pavilion, Parktown Girls’ High", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:54:32.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
