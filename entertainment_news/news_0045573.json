(AP) - Prosecutors in Northern California say San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith has pleaded not guilty to hit and run, drunken driving and vandalism. \nSanta Clara County District Attorney spokeswoman Cynthia Sumida said Wednesday that Smith's attorney entered the not guilty pleas on his client's behalf on Sept. 29. \nThe 25-year-old Smith was arrested in August in Santa Clara on drunken driving charges. \nIn a separate incident, Smith was arrested on April 13, 2014, at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed. \nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct.
