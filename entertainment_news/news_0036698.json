I could've had a stroke. I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're a**holes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\" \nNow that Selena is feeling much better, she's preparing to release her second studio album, Revival, a record she says was inspired by false rumours of her health and the frustration she had while going through her secret ordeal. \n\"I'm so f**king nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me,\" she explains. \"I've been working since I was 7. I've been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17. It's so disappointing that I've become a tabloid story. The hate motivated me.\" \nAnd while her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber is currently experiencing his own revival in music, Selena insists her former flame holds no bearing with the next chapter in her life. \n\"No,\" she insists. \"This is my time. I've deserved this. I earned it. This is all me.\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:31:10.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
