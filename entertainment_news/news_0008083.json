The amount is one-third of the 30 million baht ($857 000) that her common law husband, a clothing store security guard in northeastern Thailand, won as the first prize in a lottery on September 16.\nThe couple, who were living together at the time, cashed the winnings together at a local bank and deposited the money in the man's account, Theerapon said. A few days later the husband, Thammarong Keawsuanjik, transferred 700 000 baht ($20 000) into the accounts of the wife and their son, which is being maintained by the mother.\nThen on Monday, the 28-year-old woman received a text message from Thammarong saying, \"Let's break up,\" said Theerapon. Her husband bought land with the money and is now building a house, the lawyer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:56:29.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
