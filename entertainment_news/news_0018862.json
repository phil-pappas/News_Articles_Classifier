Murphy Dear Teen Me:\nFirst of all, one simple bit of advice: look around. Slow it all down. Savor each moment. That stuff that seems like it will last forever?\nIt won’t, not any of it.\nWhile the bad things will look increasingly small in the rear view mirror, the good things will, too — and then one day you’ll find yourself flipping through old photographs, from glossy Polaroids to faded Kodak prints, wondering where all the time went. Here’s one thing that it’s easy to overlook: Life, at its barest essence, is distilled into a series of precious small moments. Conversation among friends, the beauty of a glowing sunrise over the surging Atlantic, and the simple joys of reading something splendidly written are some of those moments.\nSo I am warning you, right now: be ready.\nLife, from here on out, is going to be a whirlwind.\nA couple of brief observations: football practice sucks, and the team will never be very good the whole time you’re playing, but stick with it. You’ll never be a star athlete, but you’ll learn a lot of things from playing. And while you won’t think that much about the great plays you made (mainly because you didn’t make many), you’ll talk about the time John Walker punted the ball straight up in the air for decades. So stick with it. It’ll be worth it.\nI know your hair is weird right now, and the bumper crop of zits seems like a Biblical curse, but in the end they won’t matter very much.\nYou’ll spend a great deal of time in the next few years worrying about what you look like, but in the end the people that care the most about you will base that sentiment upon the kind of person you are. They won’t care a whit about whether your clothes are cool or not. And you know what the most ironic thing is?\nThe weirdest stuff that people are wearing now becomes retro-cool in the future. Nobody can tell the difference between what was once chic and what was once dorky — with one exception. Leisure suits never come back. Travolta could pull that look off, but it’s pretty much over for everyone else by 1980 or so.\nA word about girls: trust your instincts. You know that quiet, dark-haired girl in homeroom? The smart one with the chocolate eyes and the gorgeous figure? She really is as sweet as she seems. Don’t give up on her. Even though she seems completely out of your league, she will eventually relent and go with you to that KISS concert.\nThe relationship will work its way out from there. In the end, she will be the key to everything good in your life. I should know: I woke up next to her this morning.\nI know you think some of the family stuff that Mama insists on is kind of lame. Why in the world do we have to eat together every single night, for example? And why is the vacation at Sea Pines each summer so important?\nWell, it eventually will turn out that she’s right. Connecting with the people you love is how you build a life. Years from now, when you’re old, you’ll tell stories about those memories you’ve collected. You’ll cherish them more than any material possession you’ve ever had — even more than that Texas Instruments digital watch that you got for Christmas when you were 12. Remember the crazy summertime spades games at the kitchen table at the beach house on Belted Kingfisher? Or the time Jennifer broke her thumb running into the tree in the front yard while you and Andy were playing football with her?\nOr when you shot out Daddy’s cigarette at the dinner table with a squirt gun? Yeah, we’re still talking about those things. They are part of the fabric of our existence now. So just play along. Don’t give Mama a lot of grief. She’s going to be right a lot more than you know—and she is not going to live forever. Soak her up. Breathe in the things she says. You’ll be clinging to each tiny memory of her far sooner than you think.\nThe whole medicine-versus-writing thing? Don’t sweat it: you can do both.\nUltimately, being a writer will make you a better doctor, and being a doctor will make you a better writer. And by the way, you know those people in high school who think you’re a dweeb for liking science, and the others who cannot understand why you like to read so much? When you’re a doctor, they will come to you for help. And when you write things, those same people will tell you how much they just love what you’ve written.\nThey’ll all grow up someday. Just give them some time.\nHere’s one last big piece of advice: Don’t be afraid to love, and love deeply. Shakespeare once said “life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.” It’s a beautiful line, filled with sadness and regret — and a bitter kernel of truth.\nIn their barest essence, human lives are easy to summarize: We are born, we live and we die. Love is the epoxy that fills in the cracks in our fractured lives and makes us whole, holding us together and binding us to one another — the stuff that fills in all that space between cradle and grave. Like a wise old man said to me once, “It’s all love, boss. That’s what it is.”\nOkay, there is still one more thing: instead of buying that Teac twin stereo cassette recorder you want so badly, take that $5,000 you’ve saved up from working at Chik-Fil-A — every last bit of it— and buy stock in Apple Computer.\nI’m serious. Someday, you’ll be very glad you did.\nSincerely yours,\nMark Murphy (the 2015 version)\nMark Murphy, M.D., is a Savannah physician and writer.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/MarkMurphy_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/MarkMurphy_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:08.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
