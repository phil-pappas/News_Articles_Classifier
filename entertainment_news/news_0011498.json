He was 79. \nIngels died in the Tarzana neighborhood following complications from a stroke, according to a statement issued on behalf of Jones by her manager, Milt Suchin. \n\"He often drove me crazy, but there's not a day I won't miss him and love him to my core,\" the actress said in the statement. \nIngels was born Martin Ingerman in Brooklyn and later moved to Los Angeles. \nBeginning in the 1960s, Ingels appeared in some movies and a number of television show episodes, including \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" ''The Phyllis Diller Show\" and \"Bewitched.\" \nHe co-starred with John Astin in the in the 1962-63 TV comedy \"I'm Dickens, He's Fenster.\" \nIngels also did voice work for hundreds of cartoons, commercials and video games. He voiced Pac-Man in the 1982 animated series. \nIngels also ran a talent agency that booked movie stars such as John Wayne and Cary Grant for TV commercials. \nIn 1974, Ingels met Shirley Jones, co-star of the 1970s TV hit \"The Partridge Family,\" at a party at actor Michael Landon's home. \n\"He pursued her relentlessly, and many in Jones' inner circle were initially put off by Ingels' gruff demeanor and brazen approach,\" according to the statement. \"As he himself said, 'I was a Jewish kid from Brooklyn and she was Miss America. A lot of people never got that. But Shirley always did.' \nThey married in 1977. Their book, \"Shirley & Marty: An Unlikely Love Story,\" was published in 1990.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:42:16.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
