Comment Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 6:09 PM Updated at 9:07 PM Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 6:09 PM Updated at 9:07 PM Actress Maureen O'Hara died Saturday at her Boise, Idaho home, her manager Johnny Nicoletti told The Associated Press. O'Hara, who was dubbed the Queen of Technicolor, starred in many Hollywood classics, including The Parent Trap, Miracle on 34th Street, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, How Green Was My Valley and Our Man in Havana . She's also known for starring opposite John Wayne in five films: Rio Grande, McLintock!, Big Jake, The Quiet Man and The Wings of Eagles. Despite her impressive resume, the Irish actress never earned an Oscar nomination throughout her career. However, she received an honorary Academy Award last November. O'Hara is survived by her daughter, Bronwyn FitzSimons, her grandson, Conor FitzSimons, and two great-grandchildren.
