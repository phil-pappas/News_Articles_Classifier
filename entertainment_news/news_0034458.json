By knowing these prefixes, your child will have an improved vocabulary and increased reading comprehension because your child will be able to understand most common words which will also improve your child's grades and standardized test scores.\nVocabulary to Teach Kids includes 3 chapters:\n1) a Parent letter\n2) a Student Letter\n3) Lessons\nEach chapter helps parents or teachers improve the child's reading comprehension and vocabulary. The letters explain in detail what the parent or teacher or student needs to do to get the desired results from the book when completing each of the lessons. The lessons have 5 activities each.\n\"Students get interventions such as support labs, 504s, for slow learning disabilities and poor grades. The book Vocabulary to Teach Kids helps those students tremendously by improving their reading comprehension and vocabulary in 30 days or less,\" said Julie Jones .\nHelps Students Compete in the Global Community of the 21st Century\nIn the US there are millions of students in public schools and in order for them to compete in the new global economy they must learn the important vocabulary words found in textbooks and school work. This book strives to provide this solution in 30 days or less. It also helps students who don't need an intervention, but want to improve their child's grades.\n\"The game changing system improves your child's grades in 30 days or less. I used the step-by-step system to improve my own child's grades. Before developing this system, I had tremendous problems helping my child with homework. I tried all types of systems and tutoring services but nothing seemed to work. Now, I'm able to help him easily. You can now have the same results,\" said Julie Jones , the author.\nIn the 21st Century, when kids grow up, they will have to compete globally for jobs.
