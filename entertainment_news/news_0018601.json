People might need a break from me. I'm going to hang out with friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\" \nThe 25-year-old singer, who is Scottish DJ dating Calvin Harris, relies on her mother Andrea Swift to help her cope with the pressures of fame, but refuses to let anxiety rule her life. \nThe 'Bad Blood' hitmaker told NME magazine: \"If you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up, then you'll be done. \n\"A lot of the time I call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and that matter.\" \nBut Taylor insists she doesn't feel the need to be perfect to maintain her success. \nShe added: \"It's not about trying to be perfect. Not to try and sound like the good witch in 'The Wizard Of Oz,' but I want to do good things with what I have. I don't think my brain could cook up shocking things for the sake of being shocking.\" break", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:20:07.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
