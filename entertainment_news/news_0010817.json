Starring Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones , the movie slips a romantic story amidst epic action sequences. Hoult stars as Casey Stein, a rookie thief who finds himself on the run from a ruthless gang headed by Hagen ( Anthony Hopkins ) after a heist didn't go as planned. The one-minute video starts with Stein and his girlfriend Juliette (Jones) engaging in a car chase which ends with a fatal crash. Stein is threatened by Hagen because he carries precious stuff that belongs to the mob boss. When the life of his long-time girlfriend is in danger, Stein calls his former employer and drug smuggler Geran ( Ben Kingsley ) to make sure that Juliette will be safe. \"You told me that if you die, you want me to move on, forget about you, but I can't do that. That's not us,\" Stein says to Juliette. Besides directing, Creevy co-writes the script alongside F. Scott Frazier (\" The Numbers Station \"). The action thriller movie will be released Stateside later this year. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Collide News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:49:31.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
