Scripps Company\nCINCINNATI , Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- \"Something Cool,\" a new show from podcast industry leader Midroll Media, premieres today exclusively on Howl Premium, the company's recently launched on-demand audio subscription service. Midroll is a wholly owned subsidiary of The E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP).\n\"Something Cool\" is an audio documentary series that features profiles of influential but underappreciated artists in the fields of music, comedy and pop culture. Sarah Thyre and Rachel Lichtman created the show and are executive producers. Thyre is an actress, voiceover artist, writer and co-host of another popular Midroll podcast, \"Crybabies\"; Lichtman is a filmmaker, writer and pop culture historian.\nBlending together music, sound clips and original conversations, each 30-minute episode of \"Something Cool\" is designed to appeal to the novice listener and to the super-fan. The first of three episodes focuses on the notable yet unsung life and work of singer, songwriter and producer Bobbie Gentry , who is known for her 1967 international hit \"Ode to Billie Joe .\" The episode, narrated by actress Mary Steenburgen , features insightful commentary and conversations with Rosanne Cash , Susanna Hoffs , Kelly Hogan , Evie Sands , Jill Sobule , Tara Murtha and early material from Gentry herself.\n\"We have a responsibility to let people tell their own stories, and let the narrative unfold organically,\" said Lichtman. \"By design, each story is shared through a tapestry of sound: layers of clips and conversations that not only transport the listener to those key moments in time, but also help bring the audience a closer view into the artist's world from the perspective of insiders.\"\n\"'Something Cool' was borne of our love for Bobbie Gentry and her music,\" said Thyre. \"We quickly discovered our shared passion for bringing other deserving artists into the spotlight. At the end of each episode, we hope that everyone will be inspired to pick up where the show leaves off and go beyond that to becoming a new fan. We want them to seek out their stories and support their work.\"\nUpcoming episodes of \"Something Cool\" include:\nNov. 16 - The GTOs : Episode 2 features the story of this all-woman rock collective that formed in L.A. in the late 1960s. It is narrated by Michael Des Barres and features interviews with Alice Cooper , Pamela Des Barres , Victor Hayden , Legs McNeil, Miss Mercy and Gail Zappa .\nDec. 7 - Carol Cleveland : Episode 3 focuses on the British actress and comedian best known for her appearances in the \"Monty Python\" TV and movie series. It is narrated by Laraine Newman and features Cleveland herself, as well as commentary from Terry Gilliam and Neil Innes .\nAs the destination for new podcasts that surpass the constraints of ad-supported shows, Howl Premium offers audiences limited-run original series, narrative dramas and comedies; in-depth documentaries, audio tours and other new and innovative formats.
