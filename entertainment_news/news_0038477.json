City and Colour's Dallas Green writes sad tunes for If I Should Go Before You. Picture: Supplied \nDALLAS Green’s wife reminded him to write a love song for his newCity and Colour album. \nSo he wrote the truly sad If I Should Go Before You , which is also the title track of City and Colour ’s fifth album You may want to grab a tissue. \nThe album opens with the epic Woman which runs for more than nine minutes. Who does that anymore? \nI will be honest with you; we had a 30 minute version. I wasn’t looking to do an epic song, I just wanted to have fun with the band in that very selfish, very self-indulgent way. We started playing a riff and melody and I didn’t want it to stop, I just wanted to go with it but when we went into the studio, I said ‘Let’s get it down to 10 minutes’. It’s fun to play one note for a long time, it’s meditative and I’ve always been a big fan of music like that, stoner rock. Why can’t I have one of those? Writer’s block ... Green fears he’ll never write another song as soon as he finishes one. Picture: Supplied. \nYou and the band went into the studio not long after you finished making the You + Me record with Pink . \nYeah, it wasn’t long after we saw you in LA. You know that every time I write a song, I fear I am never going to write another one. My wife and I moved to Nashville in November and I had a couple of good days just playing guitar and songs starting to take shape. I kept them in the rawest form and brought in the band (Jack Lawrence, Dante Schwebel, Doug MacGregor and Matt Kelly) instead of constructing them alone in the basement. Before I knew it, we had 15 songs. I was so excited about making the record with them. We had toured together for two years and had such a wonderful relationship on and off stage. I figured out the best way to hang out again was to make a record. We brought the tour into the studio which means beers and lots of whisky. There may have been some food here and there.
