The real reason David Duchovny is getting treatment for sex addiction? He wantonly cheated on wife Tea Leoni , according to new reports.\nEarlier this week, a friend of Duchovny's scoffed at claims that the \"X Files\" star was unfaithful to the stunning actress, suggesting to FoxNews.com 's Roger Friedman that he was hooked on porn.\nBut The National Enquirer reports that Duchovny went into rehab because Leoni \"finally caught him [cheating].\"\nHe said Tea gave him an ultimatum: \"Get treatment or our marriage is over,\" a source told the tab, which is riding high after getting former presidential candidate John Edwards to admit his tomcattin'.\n\"At first, Duchovny tried to lie his way out of trouble, but eventually was overwhelmed with guilt and confessed,\" The Enquirer contends.\nUS Weekly concurs that Duchovny, 48, \"has a history of indiscretions,\" according to \"multiple sources.\" The mag claims he put the moves on an extra on his Showtime hit, \"Californication.\" \"They ended up making out,\" alleges a source. \"She later heard this wasn't the first time he'd taken special interest in an extra.\"\nSince checking in for a 35-day course at the Meadows rehab center in Wickenburg , Ariz. , Duchovny has been visited by his supportive wife, who has been forced to scratch promotional appearances for her new comedy, \"Ghost Town.\"\nMeanwhile, we hear that Duchovny has irked some of the cast and crew on \" Californication \" by trying to get his cinematographer brother, Daniel, and some friends work on the show. A source also says that he has a habit of sending e-mails to people on the show, telling them that he's in a \"funk\" - though he kindly alerts them when he's out of the \"funk.\"\nA friend of Duchovny's who is an executive producer on the show denies he has the power to hire anyone. Duchovny's attorney, Larry Stein , declined to address any of the reports.\n\"We're not going to comment on each and every alleged 'friend,' 'employee' or 'insider,'\" he told us. \"This is a private matter.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:29:56.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
