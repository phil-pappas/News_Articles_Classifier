But I had to take it with a pinch of salt because if you take these things too seriously, you can get seriously carried away. But I got some really lovely compliments and it was a huge boost to my confidence, a real step up on a Monday morning.” Linda with the Changing Rooms team. \nAfter years on our TV screens as an interiors expert, didn’t Linda find it strange when the visual focus was more on her toned tum than the work? \n“It was strange, but actually I didn’t get to think about it too much because the focus on the diving was the most incredible focus I’ve ever had to give any job. It was so terrifying. \n“To do a dive off the 10-metre board was extraordinary – I didn’t think I’d ever even walk up to it. But then as the competition went on I knew I needed to do it if I was going to progress in the show. There was a lot of hand holding with my trainer and he was saying that he thought I was ready. Just imagining it was terrifying. Really, the five-metre board is terrifying. So the fact that I did a dive is a surreal experience. I was only concentrating on that, not on how my bikini was looking!” \nWe ask what her secret is. Is there one? Some slimming pills? Surgery? Or just a good metabolism? \n“People were asking how do I do it? How do I get my abs like that? And I don’t know, I’ve always been quite healthy and quite sporty. I’ve been in the gym for as long as I remember, just to keep myself fit and strong. For me the biggest thing is being strong and healthy in my fifties. That’s what I’m really more focused on. Linda at 53 \n“Don’t get me wrong, being able to fit into my skinny jeans is always nice. But to be healthy and strong is my motivation. I’d hate to have a day when I couldn’t spring out of bed, that would be a really sad day. I’m really active and I like to think I’m up for any kind of challenge. I’m prepared to go to my edge and beyond it, so it’s a mental thing really – I’ve always been the same.” \nAnd looking to make a positive impact on the wellbeing of other women is important to the designer. \n“I’m in a really nice place at the moment. I’m doing all of my interior design stuff which is really exciting, I’ve got plans for the future with that. But I’m also really into sport, health and wellbeing and that’s been something that I’ve done for as long as I can remember. And I’ve decided to launch my own wellbeing event – promoting empowerment for women – and it’s quite an exciting journey. It’s something that will happen earlier next year. I’m bringing together speakers, inspirational authors and foragers. I’ve been working with a forager who’s also an academic, and she knows everything there is to know about plants and what they can do for your wellbeing, your body and your skin. I think it’ll be amazing to put an event on over a couple of days, particularly for women, but not solely. With Gabby Logan on Splash! \n“When people focused on my figure on Splash, it took me a little bit by surprise and it was a bit weird – they don’t focus on the men that way. But I had to tell myself to just relax with it, accept that this is how it was going to be. People were focusing on my age and my body and I’d never even really thought about it before then. \n“We’re all ageing at the same rate, and I just happen to be a bit over 50! So it was weird at the beginning, why were people obsessing about it? But I thought I’d just relax about it and tell myself that it was fine – it was all really lovely comments and it was a boost to my self-confidence, I have to say.” \nWe wonder whether she’d consider anything so physically exhausting in the future: “My body still remembers those bruises! Maybe I’m up for a challenge, but I wouldn’t go back to the diving I don’t think! I can still do a forward somersault off the edge of the pool when we go on holiday and my nephews still think that’s pretty cool from Auntie Linda!” \nIt’s not only her ability to flip into the swimming pool that makes Linda cool. She’s a dedicated ambassador of children’s charity World Vision, and works to highlight the plight of children worldwide, particularly in Cambodia where a child she sponsors lives. \n“You can’t separate yourself from those feelings as a mother,” says Linda, who has a 22-year-old daughter, Jessica. “My daughter is older now but those children, those young children, their childhoods had been taken away from them. I’ve sponsored a child so I’m always connected, there’s a little umbilical cord connecting me to my child in Cambodia.” What do you think?
