And yet I did not recognize at the time what was happening to me.\" \nThe studio chief would repeatedly draw her to his hotel, she says, by asking her to meet him for something to eat. \n\"Fine, I show up. Oh, he's actually in his room,\" Judd recalls. \"I'm like, Are you kidding me? I just worked all night. I'm just going to order cereal. It went on in these stages. It was so disgusting. He physically lured me by saying, \"Oh, help me pick out what I'm going to wear.\" \nJudd says several other actors she's spoken to had \"the exact same thing had happened to them by the exact same mogul\". \nThe worst came when the head honcho asked Judd to watch him shower. \n\"The ultimate thing when I was weaseling out of everything else was, \"Will you watch me take a shower?\" And all the other women, sitting around this table with me, said, \"Oh my godâ€”that's what he said to me too.\" In that moment, I told him something like, \"When I win an Academy Award in one of your movies.\" He said, \"No, when you get nominated.\" I said, \"No, no, when I win an Academy Award.\" \nThat was a small moment of power when I was able to contradict him and hold to my reality. And then I got out of there. And by the way, I've never been offered a movie by that studio.
