(AP) — A federal judge has ordered Kentucky’s Democratic governor to weigh in on whether altered marriage licenses issued by Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis’ office are valid. \nDavis opposes same-sex marriage for religious reasons. She spent five days in jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in defiance of a federal court order. When she got out of jail, she changed the licenses to remove her name and to say they were issued under the authority of a federal judge. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union questioned the validity of the licenses and asked Bunning to order Davis to reissue them. Terry Sebastian, spokesman for Gov. Steve Beshear, said yesterday that the state has recognized the licenses as valid. Sebastian said Beshear will file a response and abide by the court’s decision. \nCHURCH KILLING \nPolice: Brothers were beaten in church to make them confess sins \nNEW HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) — Police in New Hartford, New York, say two teenage brothers were brutally beaten in church — one of them fatally — in an effort by their parents, sister and other members of the congregation to force them to confess their sins and seek forgiveness. \nPolice Chief Michael Inserra says 19-year-old Lucas Leonard and his 17-year-old brother, Christopher, were pounded with fists Sunday at the Word of Life Church when a “counseling session” meant to explore their spiritual state turned violent. Authorities say they were beaten in the abdomen, genitals, back and thighs. \nLucas died and his brother was hospitalized in serious condition. Six church members, including the brothers’ parents and sister, have been arrested. \nThe parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, were charged with manslaughter in Lucas’ death. Four other adults were charged with assault in the younger brother’s beating, including the victims’ sister. All have pleaded not guilty. \n290-a-14-(James Constantine, neighbor who knew 19-year-old Lucas Leonard who was fatally beaten in church)-“is too bad”-James Constantine, a neighbor who knew the teen who was fatally beaten, says he’s sorry the 19-year-old victim wasn’t able to get away from his family and the church.

Then Rome’s mayor resigned amid scandal and criticism by the church. And recently, a leaked letter revealed grave concerns by a dozen cardinals about the way Francis’ synod was being run. \nFrancis said: “I want in the name of the church to ask forgiveness for the scandals which recently have hit Rome and the Vatican. I ask forgiveness.” The pope added, “Jesus is a realist, and he says that it is inevitable that scandals happen, but woe to the man who causes such scandals.” \nCATHOLIC HOSPITAL-STERILIZATION \nACLU files complaint after hospital denies sterilization \nGRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a formal complaint against a Catholic hospital in Michigan that won’t allow a doctor to perform sterilization surgery on a woman who has brain tumors. \nThe Detroit News and The Flint Journal report that the complaint was made to Michigan’s Licensing and Regulatory Affairs office. \nIt says Genesys hospital in Grand Blanc won’t allow Jessica Mann’s doctor to give her a tubal ligation when she gives birth through a scheduled Oct. 24 cesarean section. Mann, who is 33, wants to prevent future pregnancies due to health risks. \nA spokesman for Genesys’ parent company, Ascension Health, told The Associated Press last month that the company follows the “ethical and religious directives” of the Catholic Church. \nCHURCH CLOSING DISPUTE \nParishioners evicted from closed church after 11-year vigil \nBOSTON (AP) — Parishioners of a long-closed Roman Catholic church south of Boston have lost their appeal of a ruling that orders them to end their 11-year, around-the-clock vigil inside the building. \nThe Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed a judge’s ruling yesterday that parishioners at St. Frances X. Cabrini Church in Scituate (SIH’-choo-eht) are trespassing on property owned by the Archdiocese of Boston. \nThe archdiocese shuttered the church in 2004 as part of a reorganization effort, and the parishioners have occupied it since. In March, the archdiocese sued to evict them. \nIn its ruling, the appeals court acknowledged the parishioners’“heartfelt beliefs” that they are entitled to remain in the church “as an exercise of their freedom of religion.” But the court agreed with the lower court’s conclusion that they are trespassing. \nMembers of a nonprofit organization set up to save the parish said they plan to review legal options with their attorney. \nBISHOP ON THE RUN \nBishop finishes 21st marathon, raises money for legal help \nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — The head of the Catholic Diocese of Springfield, Illinois, is a bishop on the run. \nBishop Thomas John Paprocki completed his 21st marathon in 21 years on Sunday. He finished the 26.2-mile Springfield Marathon in just under 4 hours and 50 minutes.

It helps Catholic Charities Legal Services of Springfield assist low-income parishioners obtain pro bono legal services. Local attorneys volunteer their services to the clients. \nPaprocki got the program started. He says everyone deserves competent legal representation regardless of ability to pay. \nAnother $10,000 was raised for the Chicago Legal Clinic endowment fund, which Paprocki helped establish. It has helped hundreds get legal help with problems from domestic violence to immigration status. \nPOLYGAMOUS TOWN-BIRTH DECLINE \nBirth rate declines sharply in polygamous town \nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The number of babies born in a polygamous town on the Utah-Arizona border sharply declined from 2009 to 2013 — a time period when jailed church leader Warren Jeffs ordered a halt to all marriages and sexual relations between those already married. \nHealth department records show only 42 babies were born in the sister cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona in 2013 — down 11-fold from the 467 births in 2009. \nThe majority of residents belong to a sect known as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS, that practices polygamy under the belief that it brings exaltation in heaven. That teaching is part of the legacy of the early Mormon church, but the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibits it today. \nThe ban on sexual relations came in late 2011 after Jeffs was sentenced to life in a Texas prison for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered wives. \nSAUDI-HAJJ \nNew tally shows at least 1,621 killed in Saudi hajj tragedy \nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A new tally shows at least 1,621 pilgrims were killed in last month’s crush and stampede during the hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. \nThe Associated Press count yesterday is based on totals provided by officials and state media in 19 of the over 180 countries that sent pilgrims. \nThe AP count is more than double Saudi Arabia’s official tally of 769 killed and 934 injured in the Sept. 24 disaster in Mina (MEE’-nah), a few miles from the holy city of Mecca. \nSaudi officials previously have said their tally remains accurate, although an investigation into the causes of the tragedy is ongoing. They have not updated their casualty toll since Sept. 26. \nThe previous deadliest-ever incident at the hajj happened in 1990, when a stampede killed 1,426 people. \nINDIA-LITERARY UPROAR \n41 writers return Indian award, cite climate of intolerance \nNEW DELHI (AP) — Many in India’s literary community are disgusted. Dozens of writers say every day brings more evidence of intolerance and bigotry going mainstream — a man lynched allegedly for eating beef, an atheist critic of Hindu idol worship gunned down — all met by a deafening silence from the government. \nAs of yesterday, 41 novelists, essayists, playwrights and poets had returned the awards they received from India’s prestigious literary academy to protest what they call a growing climate of intolerance under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. \nThe government has dismissed the writers’ protests, questioning their motives and accusing them of being politically motivated. \nWhen Modi won a landslide victory in 2014, many voiced fears of right-wing Hindu nationalism leading to communal violence and religious intolerance. Modi, who spent years dodging allegations of failing to stop riots in Gujarat state in which around 1,000 Muslims died, assured the nation that he was prime minister for all and would work for everyone.
