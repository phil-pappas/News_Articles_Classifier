Here are some of the sobering statistics:\nIn 2014, there were 63 reports of domestic violence per 10,000 residents of Monroe County, for a total of 4,709 reports made that year.\nIn Rochester, the rate was 111 reports per 10,000 residents, a rate that's more than double the statewide rate of 46 reports per 10,000 residents.\nSome sobering stats on domestic violence in #roc pic.twitter.com/Bkgg64j23z\n— Meaghan McDermott (@meagmc) October 1, 2015 Overall, there were more than 50,000 calls placed last year to the county's 911 dispatch system that were classified as domestic disputes.\nAnd, 2014 was the first time that more domestic violence incidents were reported in suburban Monroe County than in the city.\n\"We all know someone whether we are aware of it or not affected by domestic violence,\" said Jaime Saunders, president and CEO of Willow Center, formerly Alternatives for Battered Women.\nShe noted recent cases here that brought issues of domestic violence to the forefront: the ongoing trial of Charlie Tan of Pittsford, accused in the February slaying of his father Liang Tan; the beating death on Feb. 7 of Twynette Ruffin of Rochester , who was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend, Artis Miller Jr.; the Feb. 25 death of Dennis Perks of Gates , who was allegedly shot to death by his fiancée, Ronna Nary; and the Jan. 18 stabbing death of Candra Keels of Rochester, who was killed by her girlfriend, Sherrita Crumpler .\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nCharles Tan jurors sent home, still no verdict\n“How can you hold a job when you're terrified at home? How can we expect our children to succeed when they fear what is there when they get off the school bus?”\nJaime Saunders, CEO of the Willow Center \"We know that intimate partner violence is a learned behavior and we know it is 100 percent preventable,\" she said, underscoring the importance of providing interventions and supports for both the abusers and the abused in order to stop the cycle of violence.\nTaking a lead from the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative's work to help move families out of poverty, Thursday's press conference focused on the ripple effects of domestic violence, the stresses faced by families and children coping with trauma and how those stresses reverberate throughout the community.\n\"At the root of many of our challenges — when we scratch beneath the surface — we know domestic violence is there,\" said Saunders. \"How can you hold a job when you're terrified at home? How can we expect our children to succeed when they fear what is there when they get off the school bus? School attendance, graduation rates, unemployment, illiteracy, poor health, poverty, teen pregnancy, sexual assault, crime. You name the community challenge and most often, family violence is lurking in the background.\"\nDomestic violence in all its forms is a community problem that needs community action, said Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren. \"We can no longer sit by and allow our children to grow up in homes where they are experiencing domestic violence. We can no longer sit silent while their parents are suffering. We are a community that is united to change that, to uplift everyone because we truly believe that the rising tide lifts all boats.\"\nShe told a story about how she'd been sitting outside recently on her grandfather's porch and overheard a woman inside a car parked nearby berate a 5-year-old in the back seat.\n\"When she stepped out of the car, I realized that she was pregnant and I stepped off the porch and said 'Why do you have to talk to her like that?' and she turned to me and said, 'Mind your own effing business,'\" Warren said. \"I said to her \"that is my business, she is my business.'\"\nWarren said she let the woman know who she was, why she cared about what was going on with the woman and the little girl and that Rochester offers myriad services and supports for families in need or in crisis.\n\"You have to take the time and you have to recognize that it is your problem and that you can no longer sit on the sidelines, we all have to get in the game,\" said Warren. \"It is about working hand-in-hand as a community, not only to bring awareness, but to do something about it.\"\nMCDERMOT@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http%3A//willowcenterny.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-DV-Report-to-the-Community.pdf&embedded=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6794ee793be89ed9bf8b3b48c0649586eb06a000/c=68-0-533-465/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635792999421756639-CQPKMHhWIAA31lt.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/roc?src=hash", "http://willowcenterny.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-DV-Report-to-the-Community.pdf", "https://twitter.com/meagmc/status/649587916910514177", "http://t.co/Bkgg64j23z"], "published": "2015-10-01T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:14:38.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
