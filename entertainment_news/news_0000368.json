So far, Coastal Pet Rescue has treated five canines for heartworms, and two more are still awaiting their turn, but help is urgently needed to fund the medical care. Although heartworms are preventable thanks to monthly medications, many of the dogs Coastal Pet Rescue rescues have not been kept current — if ever at all — on the prevention, and thus need the expensive treatments. Treatments can run $600 to $1200 depending upon the severity of the infestation, and since Coastal Pet Rescue does not believe in passing on the excessive medical bills for adopters and instead charges only a flat $150 adoption fee, there’s a lot left to cover. Donations may be made online at coastalpetrescue.org/donate or by mail to Coastal Pet Rescue, PO Box 30462, Savannah, GA 31410. For more information, contact Lisa Scarbrough at lisa@coastalpetrescue.org.\nSave-A-Life Seeks Animal Lovers\nDo you like animals? Want to help them but have limited time?

We also desperately need foster homes. These would be temporary loving, safe havens until the dogs can be adopted. We also need heavy, durable blankets to use for beds, i.e. moving blankets. The usual dog beds do not hold up as they are stripped of the fuzz filling inside, and usually ripped to shreds rather quickly. Donations of food (Pedigree canned and Rachel Ray dry) are needed, as well as monetary donations to help offset costs of operations, medicines, toys, food, tags, treats, grooming, etc. For more information, contact 912-656-9792 or go to www.g-r-r-r.com.\nAnimal rescue volunteers needed\nOne Love Animal Rescue Inc. is a volunteer based organization located in Savannah.
