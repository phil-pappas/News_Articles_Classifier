He is charged with official misconduct, theft and false entry for allegedly falsifying time records and claiming compensation for hours not worked.\nSpeaking of the performance evaluation, Lovejoy explained, \"I was directed by the city manager that (Pieri) was going to be given a $20,000 pay raise and I should prepare a city memo\" to support that.\n\"He was an excellent firefighter and paramedic and took a great number of tasks under his wing,\" Lovejoy said.\nAccording to earlier testimony, Pieri received the substantial pay raise in July 2007 when he became an exempt employee ineligible for overtime pay.\nLovejoy said he'd been pressured by high-ranking city officials to give Pieri the title of deputy fire chief.\n\"A deputy chief's position, in true fashion — totally administrative — was not feasible for the Highwood Fire Department,\" Lovejoy said Tuesday, referring to the small size of the department.\nIn the prosecution's opening Monday afternoon, Lake County Assistant State's Attorney Scott Turk described Pieri as a \"disgruntled employee\" who \"wanted to work 9 to 5 like everyone else.\"\nProsecutor: Ex-Highwood deputy fire chief was disgruntled, greedy Karen Berkowitz Lake County prosecutor Scott Turk on Monday described Highwood's former deputy fire chief as a \"disgruntled employee\" who \"wanted to work 9 to 5 like everyone else.\"\nDelivering his opening statement in the long-delayed trial of Ronald Pieri, Turk said disgruntlement and greed led the former fire...\nLake County prosecutor Scott Turk on Monday described Highwood's former deputy fire chief as a \"disgruntled employee\" who \"wanted to work 9 to 5 like everyone else.\"\nDelivering his opening statement in the long-delayed trial of Ronald Pieri, Turk said disgruntlement and greed led the former fire...\n(Karen Berkowitz) Turk said that greed motivated Pieri to falsify time records and claim extra pay for work he could have performed within his 24-hour shift.\nPieri became the highest-ranking member of the department in early 2010, when Highwood eliminated the chief's position.\nAfter Pieri's arrest in 2011, the city of Highwood placed Pieri on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation into the charges. He continued to draw his salary of about $66,000 until the fall of 2013, when city's Board of Fire and Police Commissioners voted 2-1 to suspend him without pay.\nIf Pieri is convicted of felony criminal charges related to his employment, he could forfeit his lifetime pension benefits.\nkberkowitz@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter @KarenABerkowitz\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Crime Highwood", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56269767/turbine/ct-hpn-highwood-pieri-trial-st-1021-20151020", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56251180/turbine/ct-hpn-ronald-pieri-trial-tl-1022-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:35:55.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
