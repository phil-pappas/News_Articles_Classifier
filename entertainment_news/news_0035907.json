The middle schooler is juggling the recording of his first three-song extended-play album and preparing to sing in a big Boston show, all while keeping up with his studies at Atlantic Middle School. Darwin will perform at the new RISE music series at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston on Thursday. RISE is curated by singer, rapper and Braintree native Shea Rose and music producer Simone Scazzocchio. It pairs established and emerging musicians from the worlds of pop, rock, hip-hop and other genres. Darwin said he discovered his passion for singing at church, and at the age of 10 he began working with local gospel singer Marshalee Ellis-Kehlhem. “I like all kinds of music,” Darwin said. “But I really like songs that sing about real problems and are inspirational.” In November 2014, Darwin was selected as one of the lead vocalists to appear in the Rhythm of the Universe video for “Anthem for the Amazon,” a song commissioned by the Amazon Aid Foundation to raise awareness of environmental issues in the Amazon rainforest. Darwin said he’s inspired by his favorite singer, Tori Kelly, known for her songs “Should’ve Been Us” and “Nobody Love.” On Thursday, he will perform the Sia song “Opportunity” from the 2014 film version of “Annie” with accompaniment from pianist Hinako Sato. “Big dreams becoming real tonight,” the song goes – something Darwin can certainly relate to as his journey toward stardom continues. He dreams of performing on a Broadway stage, but for now he said he is excited to work alongside Rose and Scazzocchio. Also performing in the RISE showcase are Malaysian singer Yuna and Boston-based a cappella group Women of the World. Darwin will serve as an apprentice for the day to explore and tour the museum and attend sound checks for the musical acts. This is not the first time he has worked with Rose and Scazzocchio. They are also helping him record his album, set for release later this year and featuring “Opportunity.” In addition to singing, Darwin has a knack for acting and playing the piano. At Atlantic Middle School, he was cast as Seaweed for the spring production of the musical “Hairspray,” one of his favorites. When he’s not busy in the studio, Darwin said he likes to dance with his younger sister Micaiah, who, he admits, is the better dancer. His father, Darwin Harris Sr., said he is proud of his son and looks forward to living vicariously through his accomplishments. Harris said his son didn’t get his musical talent from him, but perhaps from his grandmother. “My mother sang gospel music and there was always a piano in the house,” Harris said. “We’re a musical family.” As for his upcoming performance, is Darwin nervous? “No, not so much nervous as excited,” he said. Butterflies? “Little caterpillars,” Darwin said. Thursday’s performance is sold out, but tickets remain for the Nov. 19 installment of RISE featuring folk rocker Liz Longley and rapper Matthew Rosewood.
