And with an all-star cast, including Helena Bonham Carter, Ben Whishaw and Brendan Gleeson, Suffragette (which opens on October 12) is already attracting Oscar buzz. \nIt's scripted by Emmy winner Abi Morgan, who had something of a golden year in 2011. Aside from penning Streep's acclaimed Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady, she also wrote Mulligan's compelling sex addict drama Shame. \nNicole Kidman is also no stranger to playing powerful women alongside Meryl Streep. \nHer turn as Virginia Woolf landed her an Oscar and a Bafta in 2003 for The Hours, and there's a good chance her performance as scientist Rosalind Franklin in West End hit Photograph 13 will also attract plaudits aplenty. \nFranklin, an English chemist, was one of the pioneering forces who helped discover the secrets of DNA and viruses. \nNicole will be dropping into the studio to discuss that drama, and might also lift the lid on the other half dozen projects she's lined up for, including The Family Fang, Genius, and Secret in Their Eyes. \nNaturally Graham will be keeping the atmosphere as light as a souffle, so there's little chance of viewers learning too much about the suffrage movement or cracking the DNA code. \nThis is Friday night telly after all, and a show which is more about making viral clips than talking about viruses. \nHowever, if there's time, we will get to experience another red chair moment as a member, or members, of the public recall some of their most embarrassing experiences before either walking free or abruptly showing their feet to the masses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:31:49.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
