Gore freaks might find it slow going during the set-up; art house types may faint once the red starts running; romantics may become severely disillusioned. And that’s the glory of “Crimson Peak”: It panders to no one and stands on its own twisted brilliance.\nDirector and co-writer Guillermo del Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth,” “Pacific Rim”) has taken a classic Gothic tale and twisted it so far its head is on backwards. An aspiring writer, Edith (angelic Mia Wasikowska), falls for an English businessman, Thomas (Tom Hiddleston), who is traveling with his enigmatic sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain). After the untimely (and gruesome) death of her father (Jim Beaver), Edith marries Thomas and returns with him to his crumbling yet impressive estate.\nAnd what an estate it is. Holes in the ceiling, built on unstable red clay, dilapidated yet still monumental and thoroughly isolated, it also turns out to be wholly haunted. Ghosts drenched in red with rib cages showing pop up in hallways and bathtubs and soon Edith herself is spitting up blood. Could it be something in the bitter tea Lucille keeps offering?\nHiddleston is a fine, confused suitor, and Charlie Hunnam serves as Edith’s would-be savior, but this movie is about the unleashed and fully magnificent Chastain going for Wasikowska’s exposed but resilient jugular. In a more mundane setting it might be a confusing bore, but del Toro’s haunted house is such a brilliant character itself that it becomes all-enveloping. Creepiness has never looked so good.\ntlong@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/toomuchTomLong \n\n‘Crimson Peak’ \nGRADE: B+ \nRated R for bloody violence, some sexual content and brief strong language\nRunning time: 119 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:50:13.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
