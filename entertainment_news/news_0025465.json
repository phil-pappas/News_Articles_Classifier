As part of the Michigan Interscholastic Horsemanship Association (MIHA), the Manistee Equestrian Team, a Division D team (divisions are separated by the number of riders on each team), is invited to competitions around Michigan throughout the year.\n“Community support has always and will always remain one of our top priorities,” commented Best Drug Rehabilitation founder Per Wickstrom. “In recovery from addiction, it is vital that our patients learn the importance of giving back to others and to the community that they call home. And, since actions speak louder than words, it is equally as important that we lead by example and show our patients that donating time and effort to others can truly be the more rewarding opportunity. We wish the Manistee Equestrian Team the best of luck in their upcoming competition, and look forward to them bringing first prize back home.”\nThe Manistee Equestrian Team\nThe Manistee Equestrian Team is comprised of sisters Shanna and Chelsey Tetzlaff as the two riders, coached by Shannon Tetzlaff and assisted by Sharla Tetzlaff, also sisters. In the past few years, this small family team has made strong showings in competitions, making it to state level on three different occasions. In two of those showings they placed third, and fourth in another. As the current show season has progressed, the Manistee team has sat in first place in the district in their division, and recently won the title in the regional competition held in Ludington, MI, on October 3rd-4th. They are now eligible to compete in the State Finals in Midland, MI on October 15th-18th.\nAbout Best Drug Rehabilitation\nAs a leading provider of effective substance abuse treatment programs, Best Drug Rehabilitation strives to make a difference in the world around us.
