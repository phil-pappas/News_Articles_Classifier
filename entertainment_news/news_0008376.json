The 29-year-old Victoria's Secret model, who is dating American actor and producer Bradley Cooper, opened up about balancing her love life and career. \nIn an interview with Hello! magazine, Shayk shared her views on women's right to work. She said: \"I don't think a partner of mine would ask me to do that. Mutual respect is very important in a relationship and since my work is part of my life, he would have to respect it.\" \n\"I believe women should be independent and have their own life,\" Shayk added. \"But I also think that when a couple decides to have a family, things change because you need to live in unison. Of course I want to have a family, but there's a right time for everything. When my time comes, it will happen.\" \nRumours that Shayk and Cooper are dating started in May, after the two were pictured getting intimate at a Met Gala after-party hosted by Rihanna in New York. In the photos obtained by Daily Mail, the American Sniper actor and Shayk were seen having a good time together and sharing passionate kisses before heading to see a late Broadway show. \nMeanwhile, Shayk split from former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo this January. Rumours that the couple have broken up started after Shayk unfollowed him on Twitter . She did not come to support Ronaldo when he was honoured with the prestigious Ballon d'Or title for the third time, at a ceremony held in Zurich, Switzerland.
