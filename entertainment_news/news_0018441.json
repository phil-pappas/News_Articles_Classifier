Everyone tells me that playing the villain is the most fun and I’m not having fun.”\nThe voice of experience — Hiddleston plays Loki in the “Thor” films — replied, “It’s fun when they’re having fun doing what they’re doing.”\nThat isn’t Lucille.\n“It was never, ‘Oh this is a fun, light day!’ Every day was so intense,” the actress recalled.\nShe felt so drained when “Crimson” wrapped, “I was supposed to go do another film, but I was so depleted I left that film and took time off.”\n“Crimson Peak” marks the second time Chastain has worked with del Toro, Mexico’s master of the macabre. He was executive producer on her 2013 horror hit “Mama.”\nBefore filming “Peak,” del Toro gave each actor a 10-page character biography. It proved an eye-opener for the actress.\n“I wanted to understand why she does the things she does, and actually it broke my heart. I found that every (horrible) act she commits is to try to give and to receive love.\n“I think the true monsters are her parents. When she was a child, her mother would get beaten by the father, and Lucille was the nursemaid to the father. So taking care of the mother was an act of love associated with suffering.”\nWhenever her younger brother did something wrong, “Lucille would take the punishment,” Chastain said.\n“That’s why she has scars. So her way of showing love to her brother was to be beaten. Lucille’s always connected love to some kind of pain or suffering, and she can’t quite move through that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:45:34.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
