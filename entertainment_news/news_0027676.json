Followed by confused looks from the rest of the newsroom. \nPredictably, the “there are too many TV reboots” articles started flowing, arguing that enough is enough, let’s try something new. But TV is trying new stuff, all the time. With so much original scripted TV on myriad platforms, there’s definitely room to indulge more than a few nostalgia-heads. \nThe very serial nature of television lends naturally to sequels and another chapter in the stories of characters you’ve been following for years. Older but no less paranoid. Source: Supplied \nMore often than not, they’re a one-off miniseries like the X-Files or Heroes Reborn , giving fans one more taste without overstaying their welcome. Other times, it’s giving a second chance to a franchise that was prematurely cancelled, like Family Guy or Arrested Development . \nYes, reboots are driven partly by networks and studios seeing an opportunity to make another buck. But for something like the Gilmore Girls , an extra valedictory season is also a chance to redeem what was a lacklustre final season without the show’s creator and real voice, Amy Sherman-Palladino. You’ll struggle to find Gilmore fans who liked the way the show ended under the tutelage of a usurper writer/showrunner. \nReportedly, Sherman-Palladino is on board with the reboot. And this is crucial to most successful reboots. Without the show’s original creators or the creative forces that shaped it, there’s almost no point. \nIn films, the director is king but in TV land, it’s all about the writer. What would Buffy have been without Joss Whedon? Six Feet Under without Alan Ball? The Sopranos without David Chase? Mad Men without Matthew Weiner? 30 Rock without Tina Fey? Or you may remember how The West Wing floundered for a few seasons after Aaron Sorkin quit. They tried to reboot Buffy without Joss Whedon. They failed. The world rejoiced. Source: Supplied \nSo in most cases, it’s integral that the original writers be involved. Would people really be interested in the X-Files reboot if Chris Carter hadn’t signed up? I doubt David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson would’ve signed those contracts. Or what about those few horrible weeks when it looked like the Twin Peaks sequel (25 years on, as promised in the Red Room) was going to go ahead without David Lynch? Unthinkable. \nA few years ago, there was talk (and even a casting decision) on rebooting Buffy to cash in on the then-domination of Twilight . But it was going to be completely retconned and done without Joss Whedon. The outrage was deafening — as it should’ve been. Happily, the (terrible) idea went away and no one’s heard a peep about it since. \nWith the same proven hands in the writer’s room, it’s a pretty good bet that you’re going to get some great TV. \nThere are exceptions, of course. While the Coen brothers serve as executive producers on the excellent TV reboot of Fargo , it’s helmed by Noah Hawley. \nSome reboots, under new teams, have been dramatically better than the original incarnations. The Battlestar Galactica “reimagining” by Ronald D. Moore actually took what was a mediocre pulp 1970s sci-fi show that was cancelled after one season and turned it into character-driven, politically relevant TV. Netflix’s acclaimed Daredevil series was also universally better than the Ben Affleck movie from 2003. Much, much better than the original Battlestar Galactica. Source: Supplied \n“But it’s signalling the slow death of originality”, I can hear people cry. But who says originality is everything? TV is full of amazing content that’s been borrowed from other mediums or other countries. \nGame of Thrones is adapted from books while The Walking Dead comes from graphic novels. And US studios have been mining overseas series for years — House of Cards , Homeland , Veep and Jane The Virgin wouldn’t have given audiences hours and hours of enjoyment if everyone stuck to “original” ideas. \nI’m not saying every reboot has or would work — lord knows 90210 and Dallas were better left to re-runs — but don’t write off reboots just because they’re reboots. They may just surprise you yet. “See you in 25 years” ... yes, you will.
