Since the debates have set records for high ratings, television networks have an incentive to keep the candidates onstage and on the air for as long as they possibly can.\nCNBC had also initially called for no opening and closing statements, which made some candidates unhappy because it would take away their best chance to speak directly to voters without having to be called on to respond to a question.\nRepublican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed the agreement. RNC Chairman Reince Prebius said there would be an open-ended question to all of the candidates at the beginning.\nDebate format squabbles are common in presidential campaigns, an issue magnified this year because of the number of candidates running and their popularity as television events. Trump had threatened not to appear on the second GOP debate on CNN unless the network made a $10 million donation to charity; no donation was made and Trump appeared.\nPolitics & Government Donald Trump", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:58:09.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
