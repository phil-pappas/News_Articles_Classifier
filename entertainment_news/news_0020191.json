UGA! UGA!” before the Bulldogs ran the clock out.\nGeorgia (5-2, 3-2 SEC) avoided its first three-game losing streak since 2010. The Bulldogs were drubbed by Alabama in their last home game and then were dropped on Rocky Top by Tennessee after blowing a 21-point lead.\nThe first win for the Bulldogs over an FBS team in four weeks sets up a rivalry game on Oct. 31 in Jacksonville against No. 8 Florida with the SEC East race tightening. Florida lost to LSU 35-28 Saturday night for its first SEC loss.\nMissouri (4-3, 1-3 SEC) seems about done in the SEC East after winning the division the last two seasons. The Tigers have losses to both Georgia and Florida now, two teams that are the top contenders in the division.\nThe teams traded field goals with Missouri leading 3-0 after the first quarter and 6-3 at halftime.\nGeorgia tied the game on a 24-yard Marshall Morgan field goal after the Bulldogs had first-and-goal at the 5 and kept the ball after an interception was overturned by replay.\nThe Bulldogs looked ready to go ahead but Morgan was wide left from 26 yards with 5:40 to play.\nAfter freshman Terry Godwin’s 18-yard punt return with 4:18 to go, quarterback Greyson Lambert (23 of 32 for 178 yards, interception) hit Malcolm Mitchell for 8 yards on a third-and-7 and went to him again on the next play on a deep ball when Anthony Sherrillls was flagged for pass interference to give Georgia the ball at the 24-yard line.\nSony Michel (87 yards on 26 carries) went 8 yards up the middle and Morgan got a shot at redemption. This time he was down the middle.\nGurley is a rookie with the St. Louis Rams who returned for homecoming during an off weekend. Chubb will have surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left knee sustained a week earlier.\nWithout the player who was a Heisman Trophy candidate, Georgia leaned on is defense, playing for field position and slogged through the game offensively against a team that ranked 122nd in the nation in scoring and 121st in total offense. Missouri looked the part of having one of the best defenses in the SEC.\nGeorgia held Missouri to 164 total yards while gaining only 298.\nThe Bulldogs were fortunate when Lambert was picked off after a deflected pass on the first play from scrimmage and Ian Simon was tackled at the Georgia 1. The defense held, forcing a 20-yard Andrew Baggett field goal.\nGeorgia outgained Missouri 177-127 in the first half and controlled the ball 18:04 to 11:56, but the Bulldogs couldn’t convert a fourth-and-1 when Brendan Douglas was stopped for no gain (Michel was in the locker room briefly for an undisclosed apparent injury) and had an onsides kick from Morgan fail to travel 10 yards.\nGeorgia’s defense forced a three-and-out, but Missouri went ahead 6-3 after a 12-play, 84 yard drive.\nFreshman quarterback Drew Lock (11 of 26 for 143 yards) completed five straight passes on the drive, including 24 yards to Russell Hansbrough, 14 to Ish Witter and 29 to Cam Hilton, but Georgia’s defense held after Missouri had a first-and-goal at the 9 and the Tigers settled for a 24-yard Baggett field goal.\n“If we take care of business, we’ll get in the end zone,” Georgia coach Mark Richt said on a radio interview before heading ot the locker room at halftime.\nIt didn’t happen. Georgia survived what was called an interception initially at the Missouri 2, when replay showed that the ball hit the ground before safety Sherrills secured the ball.\nOn came Morgan who hit a 24-yard field goal with 33 seconds left in the third quarter.\nGeorgia lost one of its best defensive players in the third quarter when safety Dominick Sanders was called for targeting on an incomplete pass on the sideline to Emanuel Hall.\nThat removed him for the rest of the game and means he will miss the first half of Georgia’s next game against Florida.\nMissouri 3 3 0 0 — 6\nGeorgia 0 3 3 3 — 9\nFirst Quarter\nMo_FG Baggett 20, 12:40.\nSecond Quarter\nGeo_FG Morgan 29, 8:53.\nMo_FG Baggett 24, :07.\nThird Quarter\nGeo_FG Morgan 24, :33.\nFourth Quarter\nGeo_FG Morgan 34, 1:44.\nA_92,746.\nMo Geo\nFirst downs 6 19\nRushes-yards 22-21 45-120\nPassing 143 178\nComp-Att-Int 11-26-0 23-32-1\nReturn Yards 39 57\nPunts-Avg. 7-45.7 5-36.0\nFumbles-Lost 2-1 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 4-27 3-30\nTime of Possession 21:05 38:55\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING_Missouri, Hansbrough 11-24, Witter 6-15, Team 1-(minus 2), Lock 4-(minus 16).
