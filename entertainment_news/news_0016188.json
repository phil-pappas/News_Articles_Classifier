Every year, the event is made even brighter by the presence of Star Magic’s crowd-drawers including Kim Chiu, Maja Salvador, Paulo Avelino, Matteo Guidicelli, Xian Lim, Liza Soberano, Enrique Gil, Ejay Falcon, Rayver Cruz, Jessy Mendiola, Robi Domingo, Joem Bascon, JC de Vera, Pokwang, Angeline Quinto, Zaijian Jaranilla, Nash Aguas, Alexa Ilacad, PBB alumni, Inigo Pascual, Sofia Andres, Michelle Vito and Bea Alonzo to name a few. Iza Calzado also joined the annual Sunpiology Run. \nStar Magic’s Rayver Cruz, Diego Loyzaga, Kaye Abad, JC De Vera, Ejay Falcon, Jayson Gainza, Joem Bascon, Janus del Prado and Enchong Dee are just some of the artists who will join the run this time. \nOf course, Sun Life ambassador and Hebreo Foundation founder Piolo Pascual continues to be at the forefront of this annual event. “I’m hoping that this will be the biggest and brightest SunPIOLOgy Run yet. Aside from being able to send more scholars to school, we will also be doing our part in stopping the spread of a debilitating disease such as diabetes. So guys, let’s run together in the name of a healthier and diabetes-free Philippines,” he said. \nGlobal health statistics show that the Philippines has become an “emerging hotspot” of diabetes as it affects more than four million Filipinos, apart from those who remain undiagnosed. This is despite the fact that the disease can be prevented and managed with a healthy lifestyle. \nThis disturbing trend prompted Sun Life-Philippines to dedicate the SunPIOLOgy Run 2015 to the fight to #KickDiabetes and finally halt its escalation. Run for health and education \nNow on its seventh year, the SunPIOLOgy Run slated on Nov. 28 will carry the twin advocacies of health and education to be led by Star Magic celebrities who will physically tackle “diabetic” obstacles along the routes of the newly-opened McKinley West of Megaworld Properties in Fort Bonifacio. Beneficiaries include the Institute for Studies on Diabetes Foundation, Inc. (ISDFI), Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation Philippines Inc., Star Magic Scholars and Hebreo Foundation. \nMuch like how wellness should be accessible to everyone regardless of age, the SunPIOLOgy Run now has a new category called the Golden Kilometer or GK (P600). It’s a 1K distance that can be enjoyed by those in their 50s and up. Participants can still choose from the old time favorites 500-M Kids Dash (P350), 3K (P700), 5K (P800), and 10K (P900). \n“Together with other Sun Life territories, we are concerned about the widespread prevalence of diabetes, especially here in the Philippines. We actually belong to the top 15 countries where diabetes is most rampant,” said Sun Life Philippines President and Chief Executive Officer Riza Mantaring. “So for this year, we will raise funds for both health and education - two advocacies that have always been very close to our values as a company.” Kick up the fight \nHowever, the battle against the diabetic bulge goes beyond the finish line. Participants can give more through the Sun Life Foundation’s KICK2GIVE wherein runners will be challenged to kick body bags with “diabetes” wordmarks for additional donations to ISDFI. STOP the spread \nRegistration begins online at sunpiology.com and in-store via Runnr BHS and Trinoma and Toby’s outlets in Robinsons Galleria and SM Mall of Asia starting Oct. 19. \nCan’t wait to get started?
