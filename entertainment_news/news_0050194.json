The script is bigger and better than the book and I am excited for everyone to see it on BBC One at Christmas.” \nThe book tells the story of Len (Thomson), who becomes a billionaire after inventing a new toilet roll, and his 12-year-old son Joe (Elliot Sprakes), who longs to have a friend. \nBillionaire Boy, the fourth Walliams’ novel to be adapted by the BBC, is being made as an hour-long special that will air as part of the corporation’s festive season of shows. \nIt follows the successes of Gangsta Granny, Mr Stink and The Boy In The Dress. \nFilming on the show, which will begin in coming days in Sheffield and Rotherham, will feature local school children from Oakwood High School, Rotherham, who have been cast to appear as Joe’s classmates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:44:20.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
