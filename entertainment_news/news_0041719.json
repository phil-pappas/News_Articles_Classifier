READ MORE: \nThe Radio 2 DJ embarrassed himself when he said he thought Sasha Fierce was Adele’s on-stage alter ego during the chat on his Breakfast Show, as the singer was promoting her new single. \nBeyoncé and Adele \n“I love this stage persona you have to get over your nerves, what’s her name again?” Chris asked. \n“What? Are you trying to make me talk in the third person?” Adele said. \n“Don’t you have this alter ego who you pretend to become?” he continued. \nStill puzzled, she replied: “Nah, not really. I chat a lot.” \n“No, I’ve got a name here,” he insisted. \n“Sasha Fierce? That’s Beyoncé!” she exclaimed, before exploding into her infamous cackle. \n\"Sasha Fierce is Beyoncé's alter ego, and she's now Mrs Carter. I wish I was Sasha Fierce!\" she joked. \nLeft mortified, an embarrassed Chris added: “I can only apologise on behalf of the whole of the BBC.” \nAdele popped into Radio 2 to chat to Chris Evans \nAdele appeared on a number of radio stations on Friday morning, after unveiling her first single in three years , ‘Hello’. \nThe stunning track sent Twitter into meltdown after receiving its first play on Nick Grimshaw’s Radio 1 Breakfast Show, with the singer becoming emotional at the response from fans who were delighted to have her back. \nExplaining her decision to take such an extended hiatus after the release of 2011 album ‘21’, she said: “I always want to make music that I think is good. I didn't want to come back with something that people wouldn't like,” adding that becoming a mother to son Angelo had also delayed things. \nShe added that she nearly gave it all up during the recording process, explaining that her team didn’t believe the songs she was making were good enough following the huge worldwide success of ‘21’. \n“I wanted to give up a lot because I couldn’t do it and I thought I’d run out of ideas and lost my ability to write a song,” she said. \n“My team around me are very honest. They were like, ‘It’s not good enough. Go back to the drawing board’. It is such a relief because it’s been a really long time coming.” \nWatch the video for ‘Hello’ below... Adele's new album '25': What we know so far of   In the least surprising music news of the year, the singer confirmed her third album will be called ‘25’, which follows the tradition of her first two albums being named after the age Adele was when she wrote and recorded them. Adele’s third album has a release date set for 20 November 2015. Just in time for Christmas. If ‘19’ and ‘21’ were break-up records, this is (in her words) Adele’s ‘make-up’ album. She’s in a very different place since she released the 30 million-selling ‘21’ in 2011. Four years on and she’s given birth to her son Angelo and hibernated to spend plenty of QT with him and her partner (and Angelo’s dad), Simon Konecki. So there’s been no heartbreak (as far as we know) but plenty of growing up, as Adele so beautifully put in her open letter to fans, which she shared on social media on 21 October... We’ve already heard a 30 second snippet of one of the album’s final cuts thanks to that completely unannounced (and genius) TV ad that popped up from nowhere in the ad break for X Factor on 18 October. So no great musical departures by the sounds of it, but then, this is only one song.… OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder, who co-wrote ‘Rumour Has It’ is back again and pop maestro Max Martin is also on board, although we’re expecting his contribution to be more like his recent contributions to Taylor Swift’s mega-selling ‘1989’ than Britney’s ‘Baby One More Time’ (shame). Elsewhere are contributions from Danger Mouse and Canadian singer/songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr., who Adele is a BIG fan of judging by some of her most recent tweets, like the one above. Well Adele most certainly has. And a select few senior record company peeps, but that’s pretty much it. No one wants to risk what is going to be the biggest album of the next few years leaking, so security around this release is tighter than Amanda Holden’s forehead. Even Adele’s famous mates haven’t heard it, although Ed Sheeran recently claimed he knew friends who had and they were ‘really complimentary’. The same can’t be said for Damon Albarn. The Blur frontman worked on five tracks for the album at Adele’s request, none of which have reportedly made the final cut. He later described what he had heard as ‘very middle of the road’. Sour grape anyone? BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show host and 'X Factor' judge Nick Grimshaw has basically confirmed that he'll be the first person on the planet to play the first single from '25' on October 30. \"On Friday we have another guest,\" Grimmy announced on his show on 21 October. \"It's a really really great name... People are trying guess who that is. People are like, 'Is it Craig David? Is it Jordan? Who is it? Grimmy, please say your surprise guest on Friday is Adele, and that you are playing the world premiere of her new track?' \"Can you imagine? It's never going to happen is it?\" Nick added with a rather large dose of sarcasm. No. But we’re rather liking this fan-made attempt.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:05:07.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
