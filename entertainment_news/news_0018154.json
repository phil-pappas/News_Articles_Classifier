Both his movies — Addhuri and Bahaddur — were hits, so it should have resulted in him being flooded with offers.\nWhile Dhruva may have actually have received a slew of offers, the actor had signed on the dotted lines for director Chethan Kumar's Bharjari in which he was paired with Rachita Ram for the first time (he has only acted with Radhika Pandit so far). The muhurat took place in June and shooting began soon after, but according to reports, the movie has now been shelved. Apparently, the reasonf for this is that Dhruva wasn't happy with the script.\nMany are now wondering if the young Sarja is jinxed since both his previous movies took a really long time to complete, and now Bharjari is most likely to have been shelved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:14:17.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
