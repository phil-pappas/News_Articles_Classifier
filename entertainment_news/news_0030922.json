As a struggling singer-songwriter from Brooklyn, you’d be surprised by how much talent she had to just be playing in small coffee shops. When she sang her lines, it was almost as if she was alone on stage. Blake felt it, too. \nAfter being mesmerized like the rest of the coaches, he still considers her decision to be on Pharrell’s team as “the most hurtful rejection.” \nBut it’s not gonna end there! Rejections are what’s gonna make the upcoming episodes more exciting as we move closer to those last artists. \nNext week, Rihanna joins the show as the celebrity coach. Judging by the previews, I can already tell it’s gonna be great with her wild and unapologetic spunk. Rihanna is exactly what the artists need to help them bring their A game. \nSo far, Team Adam consists of twinsters Andi and Alex, father of four, James Dupré, loud and proud Jordan Smith, Keith Semple, Shelby Brown and Viktor Király, in addition to his two stolen artists, Blaine Mitchell and Dustin Christensen. \nOn Blake’s team we have awe-inspiring Blind Joe, youngin' Emily Ann Roberts and powerhouses Barrett Baber, Chris Crump, Nadjah Nicole and Zach Seabaugh, along with stolen artists Chance Peña and Ivonne Acero. \nGwen stands strong with a diverse dynamic, including Braiden Sunshine, Ellie Lawrence, Jeffrey Austin, Korin Bukowski, Kota Wade and Summer Schappell with her stolen few, Regina Love and Riley Biederer. \nAnd finally, Pharrell is still bringing the heat with his eclectic group starting with Amy Vachal, Darius Scott, Evan McKeel, Madi Davis, Mark Hood, Siahna Im and stolen artists Tim Atlas and Morgan Frazier. \nNext week, we’ll see what Rihanna has to say about the remaining talents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:17:23.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
