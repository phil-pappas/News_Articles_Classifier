Sean Connery and Gert Frobe in Goldfinger (United Archives/DPA) \nOver the decades, audiences have been shaken and stirred by a veritable production line of colourful characters, but which ones stand out as best baddies of the series? Here’s our top 11. 1. Jaws, played by Richard Kiel \nFilm: The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. \nNotable characteristic: A 7′ 2″ hulk with steel teeth that could bite through anything. \n007 fate: Unwisely turned into more of a comic character in his second outing, Jaws changed allegiance and settled down with a girlfriend. 2. Dr No, played by Joseph Wiseman \nFilm: Dr No. \nNotable characteristic: His bionic metal hands. Dr No could crush a stone into powder. \n007 fate: Boiled alive in a radioactive coolant after trying to kill Bond. 3. Auric Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe \nFilm: Goldfinger. \nNotable characteristic: A rotund, greedy gold smuggler with really bad taste in clothes. Promoted stories \n007 fate: Sucked out of a broken aeroplane window when a bullet shattered it. 4. Nick Nack, played by Herve Villechaize \nFilm: The Man with Golden Gun. \nNotable characteristic: Scaramanga’s butler and sidekick was only 3′ 11″ in height. Nick Nack is said to be the inspiration behind Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer in the Austin Powers films. \n007 fate: Nick Nack tried to kill Bond, but after a brief fight, 007 stuffed him into a suitcase and locked him away in a cage. 5. Red Grant, played by Robert Shaw \nFilm: From Russia With Love. \nNotable characteristic: Like Bond, he was a tough, psychopathic killer. Unlike Bond, he worked for Spectre. \n007 fate: After a long, brutal fight on a train, Bond pulled a knife out of his briefcase and stabbed Grant before taking the villain’s garrote wire watch and strangling him to death. 6. Rosa Klebb, played by Lotte Lenya \nFilm: From Russia with Love. \nNotable characteristic: Also known as Number 3, Klebb was a high-ranking, sadistic member of Spectre who loved torture interrogations. \n007 fate: Klebb attempted to kick Bond with a poison-tipped shoe, but he blocked the attack. Her former protegee Tatiana Romanova (played by Daniela Bianchi) picked up Bond’s gun and killed Klebb. 7. Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata Harold Sakata played villain Oddjob in Goldfinger (Press Association) \nFilm: Goldfinger. \nNotable characteristic: Oddjob was also extremely strong; he broke the railing of a staircase with karate chops of his hand. But it is Oddjob’s bowler hat that continues to enthral James Bond fans – it was edged with razors and put to lethal use. \n007 fate: Bond used Oddjob’s hat against him. He grabbed a sparking wire and thrust it against some bars where the hat was lodged. This sent electric current to the metal in the hat’s rim and electrocuted the henchman. 8. Xenia Onatopp, played by Famke Janssen \nFilm: GoldenEye. \nNotable characteristic: She killed men by squeezing them to death between her thighs. \n007 fate: Onatopp attempted to dispose of Bond via her signature method, but he attached her to a safety harness and shot down a helicopter, which sent her flying into a tree where she was crushed to death. Bond quipped: “She always did enjoy a good squeeze.” 9. Raul Silva, played by Javier Bardem \nFilm: Skyfall. \nNotable characteristic: Former MI6 operative who was captured, tortured and attempted to take his own life using a hydrogen cyanide implant in one of his molars. The suicide attempt failed, leaving him with mental scars and a horribly disfigured face. \n007 fate: Bond hurled a knife into his back. 10. Ernst Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas, Charles Gray, John Hollis and Max von Sydow \nFilm: From Russia with Love, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever, For Your Eyes Only, Never Say Never Again (Sean Connery’s non-Eon produced return to the Bond role). \nNotable characteristic: Also known as Number 1, the head of global criminal organisation Spectre. Blofeld has varied in appearance, but Pleasence’s bald, evil genius with the facial scar, fondness for stroking a white cat and aspirations of world domination is recognised as the definitive portrayal.
