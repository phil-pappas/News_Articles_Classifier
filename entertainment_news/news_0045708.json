The film, which is yet untitled, will be a love story and has the same production team as My Life Partner behind it.\n\"It will be helmed by a new director, Rajesh KR, who was Jayaraj's associate earlier. I play the protagonist. The rest of the cast and other details haven't been decided yet,\" he says.\nEver since Sudev won the State Award, the then unknown actor had been flooded with offers of films. However, he is treading carefully in Mollywood. \"After My Life Partner , I had been asked to consider several scripts but I didn't get what I was looking for. But the moment I went through this script, I was bowled over. The screenplay is just brilliant,\" he says.\nSo did he have any apprehensions about making his debut as a homosexual character? \"Not at all,\" he says. \"I had the advantage of starting off with a clean slate, without an image or brand.\"\nHowever, he now wants to establish himself in mainstream cinema as well, and \"not get slotted as an art house actor.\" Meanwhile, Sudev will also be seen in Sachy's Anarkali, starring Prithviraj, which he had worked on prior to the award declaration.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:36:20.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
