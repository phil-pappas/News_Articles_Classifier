Sara will display this drastic change when she returns on \"Arrow\" season 4 before joining \" DC's Legends of Tomorrow \". \"Legends of Tomorrow\" showrunner Phil Klemmer explains the effect of the Lazarus Pit on Sara when talking to TV Guide. He says that Sara will lose her humanity and she will continue dealing with the issue on the upcoming spin-off. \"Her story is really a simple one. It's her trying to regain her humanity, trying to find a human connection,\" Klemmer says. \"It's kind of this paradox that she's selected for the team because she's this ruthless, cold-blooded assassin and what she really wants is to feel again. And these two things are at odds.\" Sara's return was briefly teased in an international promo for the next episode of \"Arrow\". Titled \"Restoration\", the said episode will air Wednesday, October 21 at 8 P.M. on The CW. \"Legends of Tomorrow\", meanwhile, will premiere in midseason 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More DC's Legends of Tomorrow News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:49:26.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
