And I am astounded by the recent political campaign efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\nWhile it may seem this campaign is taking a back seat with the resignation of the U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, we know that extremists in Congress will be back again to attack this trusted health care provider no matter how many Americans disagree.\nAnne Gannon Planned Parenthood across the country provides excellent care to women, men and teens. Through their three health centers and education programs in Palm Beach County, they: counsel youth on how to make healthy choices and stay safe; provide lifesaving cervical and breast cancer screenings, prevent and treat STDs including HIV; and provide contraception to low-income women. In fact, no one does more to prevent unintended pregnancies than Planned Parenthood. They are also there if and when a woman decides she needs an abortion.\nIn a time where our health care system is changing dramatically, I know that women are glad to have a confidential nonjudgmental provider where they can turn for quality care at an affordable cost. As tax collector, I understand that access to a wide range of reproductive health care services is not only a health care issue but an economic one. When women and families can plan their pregnancies, they can choose to continue their education or further their careers. In addition, by spacing our children we have healthier birth outcomes. We know that when women are healthy, communities and families are stronger.\nWhile serving on the state House Health Care Appropriations Committee I was a strong advocate for women and children’s programs, as well as protecting and strengthening services for survivors of domestic violence. Women’s health care is an integral part of our overall support system for families and the majority of Planned Parenthood’s health centers are in medically underserved areas. Experts have shown that other health care providers simply could not take on the critical work that Planned Parenthood carries out.\nThe debate around safe and legal abortion has been with us for many years, but these are clearly politically motivated attacks. The fraudulent videos circulated by extremists were heavily edited and show no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. The groups behind these videos have been tied to violence and arson, and will stop at nothing to meet their ultimate goal. It is disgraceful that opponents of women’s health would use them to gain political points and threaten to shut down the government.\nEven in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott launched unprecedented investigations into Planned Parenthood despite the fact that the organization does not offer fetal tissue donation to their patients — the topic of the sensationalized videos. While Planned Parenthood in Florida does not offer tissue donation services, health centers in two other states do with the full consent of patients, following all ethical and legal guidelines. Lost in this discussion is the reality that fetal tissue research has led to breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and many other diseases, not to mention lifesaving vaccines.\nWhile I am sure Planned Parenthood will weather these current attacks, I’m disheartened by the fact that we continue to politicize these deeply personal decisions. I, for one, believe that most people would much rather focus on other crucial issues such as increasing access to health care, the economy, our schools and developing infrastructure.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/07/3c/92/Anne-Gannon.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:21:49.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
