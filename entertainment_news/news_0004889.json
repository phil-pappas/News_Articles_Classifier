The consequence of his decision, it is said, is an injured leg of his while shooing for Vedalam . \nYes, according to the latest buzz, the Veeram star had injured his right leg just before wrapping up the last day shoot of his upcoming film Vedalam which is expected to storm the screens this Diwali. \nIn spite of the injury, Ajith completed what he initially set out to do after taking an hour's rest, even as director Siva had suggested calling off the shoot for that particular day, according to the report. \nWhy Ajith hates to use body doubles? Well, according to stunt director Silva, the Yennai Arindhaal actor strongly believes that the risk factor involved in shooting stunt sequences is the same to anyone performing it and that he cannot allow anyone to take chances with their lives because of him. \nAjith is called the 'Thala' of Tamil cinema for many reasons, his concern towards others and his habit of treating everyone with equal respect is surely one among them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:10:20.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
