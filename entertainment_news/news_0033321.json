Duru's company, Omni Hoverboards, are already hard at work on a next-gen version of the hoverboard that won him the world record.\nThe hoverboard took two attempts in his test, as you can see above, to get going - but it's clear the system is being perfected bit by bit. Working off a similar system to drone flyers and with pretty crazy-ass helicopter blades, it'll probably be a few years before everyone has one.\nVia CBC\nMORE: Watch: Lexus claim that they've made a proper hoverboard\nMORE: Watch: The Lexus hoverboard is here and it looks amazing\nMORE: The prizes for these new Irish Instagram awards will have everyone glued to their phones", "external_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/i/caffeine/syndicate/?mediaId=2676322805", "http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/ID/2677046448/"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:41:13.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
