(AP / Evan Agostini) Christopher Weber, The Associated Press   5:05PM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, October 21, 2015 6:37PM EDT \nLOS ANGELES -- Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian have decided to stay married as the former NBA star continues his recovery a week after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. \nKardashian's lawyer, Laura Wasser, filed a petition Wednesday to dismiss the reality star's divorce filing from December 2013. A clerk granted the request in such a way that the divorce papers can be refiled at a later date. \nThe document doesn't state a reason for the change but shows Odom signed off on dismissing the divorce Tuesday. \nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada, and hospitalized in Las Vegas. He regained consciousness Friday and was transported to Los Angeles on Monday. \nKardashian posted a statement to her website Monday saying Odom made \"incredible strides\" at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas and thanking the doctors and nurses \"for their kindness and diligent work.\" \nThe hospital and Odom's relatives have not revealed his prognosis, but the family has hinted at a long road ahead, saying they realize his \"continued improvement\" won't be easy. \nThe brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2013 against one brand he took, Reload, after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. \nHe also told at least one of the women that he had done cocaine, but the brothel says it did not see him take any drugs. \nLove Ranch owner Dennis Hof has said that Odom arrived Oct. 10 for a four-day stay and spent $75,000 on two women who accompanied him in a VIP suite. \nTest results from blood samples obtained through a warrant still are pending, and authorities have not ruled out the possibility of taking action against the brothel or Odom. \nAP Entertainment Writer Anthony McCartney contributed to this article.
