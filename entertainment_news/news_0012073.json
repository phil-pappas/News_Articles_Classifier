While she doesn’t have any shows lined up in Lancaster (yet), the godmother of punk played a show at the Chameleon Club in 2001. \nA dive into the LNP archives found a preview story for the May 8 show (“over 21 only, $15 advance, $17 at the door”) plus a review from the intimate show. \nSmith talked about her exit from the spotlight with Jon Ferguson , now features editor. Smith had finished her European tour in support of her fourth album, “Wave” in 1979 and then disappeared for life with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic Smith of MC5 fame. \n\"At the end of \"Wave,’ I felt that I had contributed all that I knew how to contribute at that period of my life within the arena of rock ’n’ roll,\" Smith said during a telephone interview from her New York City home. \"I felt I needed to evolve as a human being and as an artist to contribute any more.\" \nAt the time, the 54-year-old rock star was five years into the resurrection of her career. \nThe poet and painter started experimenting with sound with guitarist Lenny Kaye in the early 1970s. \n\"I did the poetry in 1971 with Lenny and I wanted to really infuse some revolutionary energy into the performance of poetry,\" she said. +2 Patty Smith performs in 1978.

The Patti Smith Group and another band, Television, made CBGB their home and sparked the beginning of punk. \n\"At that time, rock ’n’ roll was a highly male-dominated arena,\" Smith said. \"I didn’t have any particular role models or anybody I was emulating. My goal was always ... I always wanted to shake things up or energize situations or inspire other people.\" \nSmith made four albums (\"Horses,\" \"Radio Ethiopia,\" \"Easter\" and \"Wave\") from 1975 to 1979. She made \"Dream of Life\" in 1988. \n\"\"Dream of Life’ was written and produced by my husband,\" Smith said. \"He as a musician wrote all the songs for me. I wrote the lyrics to the songs, but he wrote all of the music, played all of the guitar and co-produced it. It was a real collaboration and it had its own life.\" \nShe then disappeared before releasing “Gone Again” in 1996. \n\"The period between \"Dream of Life’ and \"Gone Again,’ that period, other things came into play -- my husband’s illness, the births of my children (son Jackson and daughter Jesse),\" Smith said. \"My concerns in that period were different. They were more personal. I had a lot of personal things I was dealing with that were difficult. \n\"I wasn’t concerned with the state of the music business, I was concerned with other things -- real life.\" \nWhen Bob Dylan asked her to tour with him, she couldn’t say no. \n\"I found I still had the energy to perform,\" she said. \"I still had something to say and something to contribute and was motivated to do so.\" \nShe released \"Peace and Noise\" in 1997 and \"Gung Ho\" in 1999. She toured extensively behind \"Gung Ho.\" \nAt the time of the show, she was working on a retrospective CD, but otherwise, didn’t know what was in her future. \n\"I’m not career-oriented,\" she said. \"I don’t make career decisions. If anybody thought I made career decisions, they would say that I made all the wrong decisions. \n\"But I don’t care about a career. I care about work and I care about being a mother and I care about being alive.\" +2 Patti Smith performs at the Music Midtown Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, May 4, 2001.

She went on about the \"nice pile of sauerkraut\" she’d had at Lancaster’s Neptune Diner. \nWalking around town earlier that day, Smith said she was impressed by the city’s architecture. She urged people to fix up their old houses, love them and fight to keep them from being torn down and replaced with soulless new buildings. \nSmith also got some last-minute advice from her then-81-year-old mother. \n\"It’s LAN-caster, not Lan-CAST-er,\" her mother warned her. \n“Banter aside, Smith gave a hauntingly powerful, 2-hour, nonstop performance, combining her incisive, often mystical, lyrics and poetry with the music that 26 years ago redefined the way words could be set to music and the image of the female rock singer,” Crable wrote. \n“Smith, her voice and on-stage presence as mesmerizing as ever, drew songs from across the decades and musical epochs in her life, including the nine years she walked away from music to love a husband and raise a family. \n“At times melodic, staccato, astringent and shouting, Smith and her four band members rocked through songs of loss, lust, redemption, religion, anger, anti-capitalism, save-the-planet fervor, living outside society and, ultimately, hope and people power. \n“Smith doesn’t play any instrument proficiently, but that didn’t stop her from blowing the heck out of a clarinet or machine-gunning an electric guitar. \n“She put on reading glasses and read poetry, her own and the likes of William Blake and Allen Ginsberg, with and without music. The punk poet had fun, shucking her shoes and rolling up her pants to sing \"Dancing Barefoot.\" \n“The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face \n“The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself \n“Grave visitations \n“What is it that calls to us? \n“Smith got positively campy, doing a lilting version of \"Sea of Love.\" At times she lost herself in the music, undulating trancelike or whirling herky-jerky like a woman enslaved to the beat.” \nShe ended the night with \"Gloria.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:44:02.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
