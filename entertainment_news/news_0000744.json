Thanks 4 the support! (sic).\" \nGeorgina told the Daily Echo newspaper: \"He was so excited when we received the package, but he waited to open it until his dad got home from work. He was over the moon to read Eminem's message - it means the world to him.\" eminem", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:14:26.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
