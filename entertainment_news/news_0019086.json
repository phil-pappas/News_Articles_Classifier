Photo: Getty Images \nIf the revolution is, indeed, going to be televised, Russell Brand will likely be its host.\nThe British comic-actor-intellectual-revolutionary brought his stream of consciousness to the Brisbane Entertainment Centre on Thursday night.\nIn what's part stand-up, part revivalist tent preaching (minus the Bible-thumping Christianity) Brand has a pretty simple message: only by working together can anything be achieved.\nRussell Brand joins the crowd during this Trew World Order show in Melbourne last week. Photo: Meredith O'Shea \nCollectivism, he tells the four-and-a-half thousand-odd people in the arena, is the secret to survival.\nAdvertisement And the best way to achieve collectivism, he says, is to be together.\nAdd a sexually charged dose of charisma and you have the beginnings of a movement.\nBrand is a master of making the personal connections that can make even an arena show seem intimate.\nHis audience embraces him and Brand embraces them right back.\nA walk on the floor, among the crowd, sees him come into contact with many admirers, including a pair of Byron Bay hippies – Firebird and Bratima – and wonders aloud if they have some plans for later on.\n\"What happens in Byron Bay?\" he asks.\n\"Enlightenment! Freedom!\" Bratima replies. \"It's where the evolution of man really begins.\"\nBrand: \"Yeah well you say 'enlightenment' but I hear 'anal sex'.\"\nThat sets a tone for his many interactions, save for a 19-year-old woman he encounters.\n\"I remember 1996. It doesn't seem like any time ago,\" he says.\n\"The Spice Girls, all that stuff, and I was basically walking around with basically this personality.\n\"You were emerging from a vagina.\"\nA brief pause.\n\"So was I, to be fair.\"\nSex, of course, is a constant. After all, for this self-described recovering sex-addict, it provides fertile ground for comedy.\nAnd while there was a serious, philosophical message underpinning his entire performance, Brand is, at his core, a comedian and dick jokes are, at their core, funny.\nEven if, or perhaps especially if, the dick in question is attached to Adolf Hitler.\nIt's hard to keep up with Brand and his critiques of the media, society's power structures, the struggles of the lower classes.\nBrand himself admits that can be a problem.\nHe talks a lot about his search for a coherent voice that he says was so sadly lacking in his infamous 2013 interview with the BBC's Jeremy Paxman.\nThat interview, Brand says, made him realise he needed to refine his voice, to properly articulate what he sees as a coming revolution.\nIt's been a challenge and it's made him some enemies, Brand says, including US presidential candidate Donald Trump (who questions Katy Perry's decision to marry Brand in a video played to the audience) and Rupert Murdoch, who cops a particularly unpublishable bollocking.\n\"I've learnt a few things over the course of the past year,\" Brand says.\n\"For example, if you spend your time criticising all media, it's quite difficult to make money in media.\"\nLike any good comedian performing in Brisbane, Brand has done some homework.\nBilly Gordon's telephonic escapades rate a mention, as does the infamous suburb of \"Woodbridge\". Points for trying there at least, Rusty.\nBut perhaps the highlight belonged to him and poor, confused Margaret sitting at home.\nWhen her daughter, Diana, comes up to the stage (with Brand's consent, it must be said) to spruik her veganism, Brand promptly grabs her phone and calls her mother.\nMargaret duly answers.\n\"I'm calling you to ask for your daughter's hand,\" he says.\n\"Not necessarily in marriage; I'll decide what I'll do with it once I've got hold of it.\"\nHe then breaks into song.\n\"Margaret, your daughter, I've just decided to greet.\n\"Her name's Diana, she is a vegan, but tonight's she's getting some meat.\"\nBrand is manic, but he's not a maniac. Through the maze of seemingly random philosophical musings there is an argument searching for coherence.\nBrand makes one wonder exactly what's ticking over in that mind. There's clearly intelligence and there's clearly a genuine desire to make a positive difference.\nIn the wider community, Brand is a divisive character and it's easy to see why.\nAn intellectual or a wanker? Sometimes, the line can be a little blurry.\nBut one thing's for sure – the guy provokes thought.\nAnd the ridiculous 45-minute hellish escape from Boondall's car parks provides plenty of time to devote to those thoughts.\nStay informed.
