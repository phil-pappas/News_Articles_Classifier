Pickens was offered a licensing deal with Moda Fabrics for her winning “Romance Poppies” collection, which will soon be available in several colorways and sold in fabric and quilt stores worldwide. “I am so thrilled to work with Moda. This is one of my dreams. Spoonflower has been a wonderful journey and experience for me. I am so thankful that it exists.” said Pickens, 2015 Fabric8 Design Challenge winner.\nSince 2011, Spoonflower leveraged the popularity of their weekly Design Challenges to provide designers with the opportunity to produce a collection with a large fabric house, an exciting step in the career of any textile designer. With partners ranging from Michael Miller to Robert Kaufman, and this year's partner, Moda Fabrics, the three-round contest selects eight finalists who complete a collection of coordinating designs for their original entry. This year’s theme was “botanical sketchbook.”\n“It's been a joy to see all of the different interpretations of one theme,” said Cheryl Freydberg, Vice President of Design at Moda Fabrics.\nThe nearly 800 entries to this year’s Fabric8 contest were narrowed down by popular vote to just eight finalists who were each interviewed and featured on Spoonflower’s blog and on the Fabric8 website .\nTwo of the other Fabric8 finalists were also contacted by fabric companies for the opportunity to license their designs.\nAbout Spoonflower: Spoonflower is a website that allows anyone to upload their own designs to print on fabric, wallpaper, or gift wrap.
