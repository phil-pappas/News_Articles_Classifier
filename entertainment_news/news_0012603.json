On Wednesday, October 21, the singer posted on Instagram a 15-second preview starring a group of female dancers. The Canadian heartthrob is nowhere to be seen in the sneak-peek. Instead, the girls take the spotlight as they wear bright-colored outfits and bust out some energetic choreographed moves while the upbeat track plays in the background. A video posted by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Oct 21, 2015 at 3:20pm PDT A collaboration with Skrillex and Blood Diamonds, \"Sorry\" is scheduled for release this Friday, October 23 as the second single off Bieber's new album \" Purpose \" that's due out on November 13. It follows lead cut \"What Do You Mean?\" which became the 21-year-old star's first No. 1 hit on Billboard Hot 100 when it debuted atop the list early last month. The Biebs is pretty confident about his new song. A few days ago, he jokingly declared that he'd \"punch [himself] in the face repeatedly\" if his fans don't like the track.
