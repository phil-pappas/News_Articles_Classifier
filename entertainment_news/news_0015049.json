Not much was heard about the project until recently, when the No Doubt frontwoman finally revealed that she had entirely scrapped it. Stefani had hired longtime collaborator Pharrell Williams to produce the album, but she still didn't like where it was going. \"It didn't feel right,\" she explained in a chat with Entertainment Weekly. \"I didn't feel fulfilled.\" \"That record with Benny [Blanco] was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on ' The Voice ' and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do?\" she continued. \"There wasn't enough time. So I tried to make a record where I was just kind of involved - which is how a lot of people do it, but it didn't work for me.\" However, her fans are lucky because a new album to replace the one she'd scrapped is now underway. Her recent split from husband of 13 years Gavin Rossdale appeared to inspire her to start from scratch again. \"I needed to go through what I needed to go through to write the record that I needed to write. There was a lot of prayer and meditating in the sense of trying to be open and grateful with this record,\" she said. \"These songs are really natural - they're from not worrying about what happened or what's going to happen but about living in the moment, from trying to be present and trying to feel.\" There's no word on when the yet-to-be-titled record will arrive, but she told EW she'd have more than an album's worth of material. Over the weekend, she let fans hear her new music when she debuted the heartbreaking \" I Used to Love You \" during a concert at Manhattan Center's Hammerstein Ballroom. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:26.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
