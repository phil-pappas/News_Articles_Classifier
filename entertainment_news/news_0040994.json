That night, like many, he asked why the group thought Sophocles, a general in the Greek army at the time, wrote the tragedy Ajax. \nA young soldier stood up and surprised Doerries, saying:\"I think Sophocles wrote this play to boost morale,\" Doerries recalled. \n\"What’s morale boosting about watching a great warrior come unglued after losing his best friend and try to take his own life and succeeding?\" he asked. \n\"Because it’s the truth,\" the soldier replied without waiting for Doerries to finish. \"Because it’s not being whitewashed, and because we’re all sitting here together shoulder to shoulder acknowledging it.\" \nYou can watch a trailer collecting some of the monologues below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:54:10.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
