Alia and I immediately got along very easily and also our director Vikas Bahl is a man of positive nature,” Shahid said at the launch of VisitBritain’s Bollywood Britain – Shaandaar campaign here on Monday.

I feel because of his nature his films always have a happy vibe,” he added. Talking about working with the “Shaandaar” unit abroad, he said: “If you can’t get along with the people with whom you are working with for 40 days, it turns worse for you. Thankfully, the whole crew was very young so it was very easy to bond with them”. ”And we used to go out and party a lot. I have never worked with a team who really loved partying so much.” Presented by Fox Star Studios, “Shaandaar”, releasing on October 22, is produced by Dharma Productions and Phantoms Films. \nModified Date: October 13, 2015 6:12 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:20:12.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
