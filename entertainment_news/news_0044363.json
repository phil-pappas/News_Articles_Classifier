Gracing the November cover, the Bad Girl opens up about her relationships, her 'bad girl' reputation, her sex life and the ideal man. \nThe star revealed that constant paparazzi backing her has scared her to date at all. Despite so many link up rumours with athletes, actors and singers, Rihanna says her last real, official boyfriend was Chris Brown and then Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp, who she says she was just getting to know when the paparazzi got a picture of them together which ultimately spoiled things for them. \n\"We were still dating ... we were just three months in and I liked his vibe, he was a good guy, and then paparazzi got us on vacation in Mexico. He handled it well; I didn't. I got so uncomfortable because now what? He's not even able to be seen with [another] girl, because I'm dragged back into headlines that say he's cheating on me, and I don't even [really] know this guy. Some guys ... I don't even have their number. You would not even believe it,\" she says with a laugh. \"I'm serious, hand to God.\" Given that she's supposed to be so freewheeling, can't she just have sex for fun? \"If I wanted to I would completely do that,\" she said in the interview. \nImage Courtesy of Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair \n\"I am going to do what makes me feel happy, what I feel like doing. But that would be empty for me; that to me is a hollow move. I would wake up the next day feeling like shit.\" \nTalking about relationships and the ideal man, Rihanna said, \"When you love somebody, that's different,\" she continues. Even if you don't love them per se, when you care enough about somebody and you know that they care about you, then you know they don't disrespect you. And it's about my own respect for myself. A hundred percent.\" \nImage Courtesy of Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair \nIrritated with media and paparazzi, she said, \"Sometimes it's the first time I'm meeting this person-and then all of a sudden I'm â€˜with them.' It freaks me out. This industry creates stories and environments that can make you uncomfortable even being friends with someone. If you see me sitting next to someone, or standing next to someone, what, I'm not allowed to do that? I'm like, are you serious? Do you think it's going to stop me from having a friend?\" \nShe added, \"I'm the worst. I see a rumor and I'm not calling [them] back. I've had to be so conscious about people-what they say and why people want to be with me, why people want to sleep with me.... It makes me very guarded and protective. I learned the hard way.\" \nImage Courtesy of Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair \nLike any girl, Rihanna too wants a gentleman but things are not the same! \"You want them to feel good being a man, but now men are afraid to be men. They think being a real man is actually being a pussy, that if you take a chair out for a lady, or you're nice or even affectionate to your girl in front of your boys, you're less of a man. It's so sick. They won't be a gentleman because that makes them appear soft,\" she told the mag. \nComing to sex, Rihanna admitted that she is neither dating nor having sex. \"That's why I haven't been having sex or even really seeing anybody because I don't want to wake up the next day feeling guilty. I mean I get horny, I'm human, I'm a woman, I want to have sex. But what am I going to do-just find the first random cute dude that I think is going to be a great ride for the night and then tomorrow I wake up feeling empty and hollow? He has a great story and I'm like ... what am I doing? I can't do it to myself. I cannot. It has a little bit to do with fame and a lot to do with the woman that I am. And that saves me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:26:58.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
