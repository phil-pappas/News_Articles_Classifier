This time he's facing possible charges of robbery, criminal mischief and obstruction of breathing, according to the Associated Press.

(Saratoga Springs Police Department via AP) \nSaratoga Springs police Lt. Bob Jillson told Fox News that alcohol was involved, but he wasn't sure Brendon was intoxicated. He was released after posting $20,000 in bail. \nBrendon has been charged with a number of crimes this past year, including property damage and public intoxication. He announced in June he was entering rehab to deal with depression and substance abuse issues. Tony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.
