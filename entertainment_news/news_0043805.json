Mace is now suing the U.S. Department of Interior and the historic park, which is managed by the National Park Service, for nearly $5 million in damages.\nHe claims the whack by the 16-pound pine cone caused significant brain damage.\n“To have something like a 16-pound bowling ball fall out of the sky ... it’s devastating,” his attorney Scott Johnson said.\nThe large cone in question fell from an Araucaria bidwilii , or bunya pine, one of several large coniferous trees found in the northeast corner of the park, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court. Found mostly in Australia, the trees produce large pods, which contain seeds known as bunya nuts and can grow up to 40 pounds, according to the lawsuit. The plants are not indigenous to San Francisco but were planted by the park, the lawsuit said.\nPark Service spokesman Craig Dalby said the agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.\nStunned tourists watch as a great white shark devours a seal at Alcatraz Veronica Rocha Cellphone video captured the dramatic moment when a group of stunned tourists got a firsthand look at a great white shark’s feeding habits in the wild as it devoured a seal and left a pool of blood near Alcatraz Island.\nThe video is the first recording showing the shark’s feeding habits in the...\nCellphone video captured the dramatic moment when a group of stunned tourists got a firsthand look at a great white shark’s feeding habits in the wild as it devoured a seal and left a pool of blood near Alcatraz Island.\nThe video is the first recording showing the shark’s feeding habits in the...\n(Veronica Rocha) Mace, a U.S. Navy veteran, was visiting the park Oct. 12, 2014, during Fleet Week, an event celebrating U.S. seagoing military services, when the pine cone fell on him, his attorney said.\n“He was immediately rendered unconscious,” Johnson said. “Blood was going everywhere.”\nMace was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where surgeons removed part of his skull to relieve swelling, according to the lawsuit. Mace suffered short-term memory loss and will likely need long-term care, his attorney said.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the park posted warning signs and installed barricades and netting around the trees after Mace's incident.\n“The concern is this could happen to someone else,” Johnson said.\nIn 2002, the huge pine cones drew concerns from officials in the town of Warragul, southeast of Melbourne, Australia. There, Mayor Diane Blackwood warned residents to beware of the potentially lethal pods falling from the trees.\n\"These huge pine cones have the capacity to be lethal if they were to fall on someone passing underneath from such a large height,” Blackwood said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d7430/turbine/la-me-ln-tourists-shark-alcatraz-20151013", "http://www.news.com.au/national/bunya-pine-begins-dropping-lethal-10kg-cones-the-size-of-watermelons/story-e6frfkvr-1226287770052", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dbcf1/turbine/ct-falling-pine-cone-lawsuit-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:29:50.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
