He said officials have been cautious in their spending because the fee is new and they weren’t sure how much it would bring in.\n‘SAVING A LARGE STASH’ “Given the fact that it’s a relatively new fund, there’s not a long track record on receipts,” said state Department of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer. “We do want to maintain a prudent reserve for unforeseen circumstances.”\nState Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Gerber, who sits on a budget subcommittee with Cal Fire oversight, rejected the notion that officials were being prudent.\n“They’re hoarding it,” Nielsen said. “What for, I don’t know.”\nJeffries thinks he knows. He said it’s likely related to a suit challenging the fee’s legality.\nCritics who contend the fee is an illegal tax have gone to court over the matter. And in August, a Sacramento County judge elevated the case to class-action status. A trial is anticipated next year.\nShould the state lose, it may have to refund an estimated 12,000 property owners as much as $7 million.\n“It seemed pretty clear to me that they were saving a large stash of it in anticipation of this court ruling,” Jeffries said.\nBerlant denied that is the case.\n“That’s not accurate,” Berlant said. “The courts will make their decision. In the meantime, we’re going to continue our work.”\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1g45-b88531999z.120151010211929000ggpcecv7.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1g45-b88531999z.120151010211929000g0tcfpdv.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1g45-b88531999z.120151010211929000ggpcecv7.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1g45-b88531999z.120151010211929000g0tcfpdv.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:26:19.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
