Case was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis shortly after having her old mercury fillings unsafely removed and replaced with four new mercury fillings. \"Your agency, the FDA had done nothing to warn me, an educated professional that this was a health hazard, this is a great injustice,\" she testified to the FDA in 2010.\nAfter finding research linking mercury and multiple sclerosis, Stacy found a mercury-safe dentist from the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology to safely remove her mercury fillings. \"I now know that I and millions of other Americans are genetically predisposed to autoimmune disease and these mercury fillings are the trigger in many cases,'' Case stated to the FDA.\nStacy then underwent chelation treatments to remove the mercury from her body and afterwards experienced no further symptoms of multiple sclerosis. \"Your hand picked scientists in 2006 and 2010 have made you keenly aware of the health risks and disease causation. Please do not ignore them or injured consumers like me any longer,\" Case testified as she urged the FDA to take this toxic product off the market.\n\"Evidence of Harm\" chronicles the lives of three ordinary Americans who become reluctant health advocates after suffering from the devastating effects of hazardous mercury vapors generated during routine dental procedures. The film presents a haunting portrait of a dental industry all too willing to turn a blind eye to science while placing profits and politics ahead of the 120 million Americans currently implanted with toxic mercury amalgam dental fillings.\nFilmmaker Randall Moore began researching mercury fillings after his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Moore discovered that all \"silver\" dental fillings contain approximately 50% elemental mercury. Moore stated, \"I became frustrated with our government's refusal to remove this toxic product from the marketplace. So I created this documentary to alert others of the widespread dangers of how this dental material adversely impacts public health and the environment worldwide.\"\nVideo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJO1C_ELvKc \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278174  \n \n\nSOURCE Do No Harm, LLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:06:53.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
