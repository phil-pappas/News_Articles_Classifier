The commercial, which aired during Gotham, has some glimpses of new footage from the limited 6-episode series which will also feature the return of Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and the mysterious Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who also just recently received a new character poster. \"X-Files\" creator Chris Carter is writing and directing the opening and closing episodes, while former \"X-Files\" producers Glen Morgan, Darin Morgan, and James Wong are handling the rest of the four episodes. The limited series is set to begin with a two-night premiere starting on Sunday, January 24, 2016, following the NFC Championship Game. Thirteen years after the original series run, the next mind-bending chapter of THE X-FILES will be a thrilling, six-episode event series helmed by creator/executive producer Chris Carter, with stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson re-inhabiting their roles as iconic FBI Agents FOX MULDER and DANA SCULLY. This marks the momentous return of the Emmy- and Golden Globe Award-winning pop culture phenomenon, which remains one of the longest-running sci-fi series in network television history. Production on THE X-FILES event series is set to begin in summer 2015. THE X-FILES originally premiered in September 1993. Over the course of its nine-season run, the influential series went from breakout sci-fi favorite to massive global hit, and became one of the most successful television dramas of all time. The show, which earned 16 Emmy Awards, five Golden Globes and a Peabody Award, follows FBI special agents Scully (Anderson) and Mulder (Duchovny), as they investigate unexplained cases -- \"X-Files\" -- for which the only answers involve paranormal phenomena.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:03:28.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
