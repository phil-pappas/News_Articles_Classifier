For The Very First Time” is in the midst of a 13-city tour throughout the Southeast. The Monty Python co-founders (who started the British comedy troupe with Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) will be presented Oct. 20 at the Savannah Civic Center’s Johnny Mercer Theatre. \nWhile Idle declined to be interviewed, Cleese had no such reservations. This will be his first time in Savannah. \nIF YOU GO \nWhat: John Cleese and Eric Idle: Together Again At Last ... For The Very First Time \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 20 \nWhere: Johnny Mercer Theatre, Savannah Civic Center, 301 W. Oglethorpe Ave. \nCost: $59.50, $70.50, $99.50 \nInfo: 912-651-6550, www.savannahcivic.com/events , www.etix.com \n“I haven’t been in this part of the world at all,” Cleese says. “Normally, when I’m in America, I’m connected with California for work and on the whole have not done much work in the Southeast.” \nThe audience is sure to find something to love about the show, which is not scripted. \n“Although we know roughly where we’re going and what we’re doing, there is a genuine spontaneous element,” Cleese says. “The audience likes something authentic, something that is real and uncontrived.” \nIt took Cleese a while to figure out that he was funny. \n”In the sense that I knew I could make some of my school friends laugh, I think the turning point was when I went to Cambridge,” he says. “When I look back on it, it’s puzzling. \n“I never knew what I wanted to do. I was fascinated by biology, but the teachers were terrible. I got into Cambridge for physics and math.” \nInstead of pursuing science, Cleese studied law. \n“I looked around to see what else I could do,” he says. “My grandfather was a solicitor’s clerk. \n“I didn’t think it would make me happy,” he says. “So much with law is manipulation of the other side. I don’t like legal ways of thinking.” \nThen Cleese joined Footlights, the Cambridge theater group. \n“I found the ability to make people laugh,” he says. “But I still didn’t have any idea what I wanted to do.” \nThen the 1963 Footlights Revue, “A Clump of Plinths,” was so successful at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, it was renamed “Cambridge Circus” and taken to the West End in London, a feat comparable to a college production going on Broadway. \nCleese was a scriptwriter and cast member of the production, which ended up on a tour of New Zealand and Broadway, with the cast also appearing on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in October 1964. \n“People from the BBC started offering me jobs,” Cleese says. “I got my big break from ‘The Frost Report.’ The writers’ table probably had 12 people who I’m very close to.” \nWhile on “The Frost Report,” Cleese began performing. \n“I didn’t quite realize I was doing it live for 14 million people,” he says. “It was a nice experience.” \nMonty Python, the famed comedy troupe known for the sketch show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and the four Monty Python films: “And Now for Something Completely Different,” “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” “Life of Brian” and “The Meaning of Life,” was founded in 1969. \n“Monty Python’s Flying Circus” ran for four seasons from October 1969 to December 1974 on BBC Television, though Cleese quit the show after the third season. Among his most popular sketches were the ones where Cleese played government officials, including the Minister of Silly Walks, and Mr. Praline, who had a dead Norwegian Blue parrot. \nIn the mid-1970s, Cleese and his first wife, Connie Booth, co-wrote and starred in the short-lived British sitcom “Fawlty Towers,” which has also achieved cult status. He also is known for such films as “A Fish Called Wanda,” “Fierce Creatures,” “Clockwise” and many more, including James Bond and Harry Potter films. \nIn December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on “The Muppet Show” and co-wrote much of the episode. He also made a cameo appearance in the 1981 film, “The Great Muppet Caper.” \nWill Cleese make an appearance on the new Muppets show as he did on its previous incarnation? \n“Those were the happiest days I ever had, being on the Muppets,” he says. “I adore ‘The Muppet Show.’ \n“When Frank Oz was in London, we were great pals. I’m an admirer of his. \n“I never knew Jim Henson so well, but I knew quite a bit about that bunch,” Cleese says. “They were so realistic to act with, I kind of forgot there was a man’s hand inside.” \nWhile Cleese enjoys working in film, television and theater, each has its advantages and disadvantages, he says. \n“Filming is an obsessive act,” he says. “It takes your life and you don’t have time for anything else. \n“The working days are so long. The other problem is there are very few good scripts. \n“Filming is fairly boring,” Cleese says. “It’s a test of professionalism.” \nBut television is quite different, he says. \n“Television is always a tremendous last-minute rush,” Cleese says. “Radio is a great medium, but you can’t make much of a living from it. \n“The stage has a big repetitious element,” he says. “The good thing about the show with Eric is it does vary.” \nThe current show promises some surprises for its audiences. \n“We start with a few tricks, then chat and talk about how Monty Python got together,” Cleese says. “Then we perform some sketches. \n“They weren’t written for Monty Python, but they’re in the same era and could easily fit into Monty Python. Eric and I perform those and then show a couple of short clips. \n“We sing a song and 65 minutes have passed,” Cleese says. “Then I do 20 minutes on my own and Eric does 15 minutes of his rude and funny songs, and we do a question-and-answer session.” \nMost people ask, “What’s your favorite sketch?” during the Q and A. \n“That doesn’t set us up for much humor,” Cleese says. “We’re always hoping they’ll ask rude questions.” \nSo far, the tour has been very well received. \n“I was surprised,” Cleese says. “At my age, I can pretty much tell whether something is funny or not. \n“Sometimes we’ll do something that we think is quite amusing that gets a huge laugh and sometimes we’ll do something we think is very amusing and get a small laugh. The audience will tell you what’s working. \n“The audience is very surprised when we do the sketches,” he says. “I’m thinking we want to get more of those.” \nCleese is up front about his own reason for touring. \n“I suppose it’s because I still need money,” he says. “I haven’t much money, when I have to pay $20 million in alimony to an ex-wife. There’s a dent in my finances.” \nThe settlement was incurred after Cleese’s divorce from his third wife, American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. \n“The present system in the U.K. and the U.S. benefits the passenger and disadvantages the breadwinner, who has worked very, very hard,” he says. “I find that completely despicable. \n“Now I’m married to an absolutely lovely girl and I want to be able to provide one or two of the luxuries in life for her, like holidays in the sun during dreary English winters. \n“To do that, I need money,” he says. “What nicer way to do that than performing?” \n“Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and “Fawlty Towers” tend to be most popular outside Britain. \n“In America, there is much more enthusiasm for Monty Python than in Britain,” Cleese says. “In Britain, they’ve almost forgotten Monty Python in favor of ‘Fawlty Towers.’ It varies a great deal from country to country.” \nWhile in public, Cleese would rather not be recognized. \n“I was staying in my favorite hotel in Dallas,” he says. “If I walked 500 yards to the gym, nobody knew who I was. \n“It’s a question of if it happens four times a day or 40. It’s one thing if people I’ve never met before are asking, ‘Can I have a photograph?’ \n“I often say ‘No, I’m not doing them today, but why don’t you ask that man over there?’” Cleese says. “I always try to be as polite as possible and if the interruptions and people come up out of the blue, that’s fine, but if it happens 40 times a day, you just want to get on with your business.” \nIn 1996, Cleese was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire, but declined the honor. \n“Those things are rather silly,” he says. “Sometimes I take pleasure when friends are given knighthoods, but as far as I’m concerned, it seems a bit silly, a bit trivial. \n“I was also asked if I wanted to be in the House of Lords. I thought that would be interesting. Then they made it clear I would have to stay in England in the winter, so I passed on that. \n“I never take the artistic awards quite seriously,” Cleese says. “Really, if I was dictator of the world, I would simply say that a certain number of books and films were regarded as exceptional, but not one was the best.” \nIf he had the time, Cleese has many possible pursuits. \n“I’d love to travel much more, but I’m 76 this month,” he says. “I’d like to visit South America and get to know Europe. I’d like to spend more time reading and thinking.” \nThe thing he’d most want to change is human nature. \n“I think there are an awful lot of problems because we don’t have our egos under control,” Cleese says. “I’m fascinated by the fact that rich people want more and more money. \n“I think it’s sad and I feel sorry for them. It’s terribly unhealthy and they’re not very happy. \n“If you do something you love, you look forward to it every day,” he says. “If you make money at it, it’s a bonus.” \nIn 2014, Cleese wrote his autobiography, “So, Anyway ...” \n“I’d always wanted to write a book, but I couldn’t take two months off to write it,” he says. “When I was able, I did it straight away. I’d been planning to do it 10 years before, but got very bad advice from a literary agent in New York. \n“I prefer writing to anything else,” Cleese says. “It increases the control you have. If you have to bring someone else in, he or she may have ideas I don’t like so much.” \nThat’s something that has actually happened to Cleese. \n“The trouble is nobody has ever written stuff for me that is as good as what I write by myself,” he says “The exception is Michael Frayn, who is one of the best writers I know.” \nFrayn wrote “Clockwise,” a 1986 comedy film that starred Cleese. \n“But apart from Michael, nobody has ever written anything as good,” he says. “If they did, I would be very grateful. \n“A good script doesn’t often come along,” Cleese says. “It’s amazing how many good actors and actresses there are and how many good writers make them that way.” \nCleese remembers some enjoyable experiences throughout his career. \n“I remember times when I was very happy doing particular things,” he says. “When I was making ‘Life of Brian,’ the script was very, very good. \n“Terry Gilliam did a great job directing and doing the art design. We were all performing well. \n“I got up in the morning and it was a warm, lovely experience,” Cleese says. “I remember ‘A Fish Called Wanda’ because we all got on so well. That was a very happy experience.” \nNot so happy an experience was the making of “The Meaning of Life.” \n“I got quite depressed doing it,” Cleese says. “I never thought it was our best film, although there is great stuff in it.” \nDespite his popularity and success, Cleese’s father continued sending him notices for jobs that were outside the entertainment business, but he knows he made the best decision. \n“I’m about to turn 76 and I’m still working,” Cleese says. “When you meet retired lawyers, they stay away from the law. I think it’s an important difference.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:12:47.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
