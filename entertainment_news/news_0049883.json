Viewers are fuming over the fact that the show tends to come up with survey questions which prompt contestants to give raunchy answers. In an episode, host Steve Harvey asked a contestant to name \"the last thing you stuck your finger in,\" and the player responded, \"My wife.\" In another episode, he asked a contestant to name \"the first part of a woman you touch to get her in the mood.\" The player answered, \"Um, that would be the lower front or the vagina.\" Clips of shocking answers on the long-runing game show were posted on the show's official YouTube channel. Noticing this, one commenter wrote, \"Man this show is really milking the sex thing.\" Another commented, \"They come up with these questions now knowing someone will say something like this. Not funny when it's totally planned.\" Dan Gainor, VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, told FOX411 that the sexually-charged answers were the result of sexual content becoming more acceptable on TV. \"I think what has changed is that Hollywood has so undermined and coarsened our culture, that these answers have become the norm... Sex acts many Americans had never even heard of are now typical dialogue,\" Gainor said in an email. The production company behind \"Family Feud\" has not responded to the issue. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:24:07.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
