The products: ThermaTouch In-shower 7” LCD touchscreen controller (mounts in the shower as the main command center), Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head (installs overhead inside the shower) and the visualization shower enhancement named Tranquility (operated from ThermaTouch), each work to bring the steam shower and home spa experience to levels previously unavailable except in the most luxurious spas. “We have long believed in utilizing the best technology to enhance what is essentially a very personal experience,” explains Mitch Altman, CEO of ThermaSol. “With these new products and experiences, we have elevated the home spa to its highest level and our hope is that homeowners will understand that at ThermaSol, we extol the physical and emotional aspects of the home spa experience. Our mission has always been to promote wellness through the benefits of steam and the steam shower experience. I think these products really accomplish that.”\nThe ThermaTouch in-shower 7” LCD touchscreen controller combines several new technologies in one in-shower device. So much more than a controller, ThermaTouch allows the user to access and personalize all aspects of their shower and steam environment, from steam duration, temperature setting, individual memorized presettings to Tranquility, a new visualization and sound effect experience, used in conjunction with the new Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head – introduced herein. The Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head provides a unique combination of mood lights, chromatheray and in-shower lighting, sounds and relaxing video scenes to create a shower (or steam) experience unlike any other. ThermaSol’s technology integration creates a “plug-and-play” network making adding equipment or modules simple as ThermaTouch only recognizes the modules installed. Simply, if the function or feature is not part of the installed system, the display will not show the information to the user. Because of the high resolution LCD touchscreen, options and adjustment menus are displayed in vivid graphics and images, making the user interface simple, intuitive and enjoyable. Never before has there been a controller that so seamlessly performs so many functions. It is the largest, brightest and most advanced ‘in-shower’ controller on the market today.\nThermaTouch in-shower 7” LCD touchscreen controller offers:*\n 7” in-shower LCD touchscreen controller Complete control of ThermaSol steam generator (when installed in system) Operates Tranquility mode (Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head or in-shower speakers are required for sound) Operates Chromatherapy mode Operates Mood lights and shower light\nFeatures include:\n Built-in Infrared Temperature Sensor (ITS) patent pending Date and time display Set steam session temperature Set steam shower time sessions Set and control preferences for two users and a guest Recall of previous settings Access diagnostic maintenance feature Compatible with Solitude Wireless Module Operates steam generator Auto PowerFlush™ Operates with Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head Built-in Bluetooth® Sound settings include volume, treble, mid-range and bass Stereo audio output Ethernet connection Powered by Android™\n*ThermaTouch with Tranquility and/or with Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head can be installed without a ThermaSol steam generator.\nThermaSol’s Serenity Light, Sound, Rain Head provides a unique combination of high-performance LED color mixes to create different ambiances as well as bright shower lighting, sound delivered via its speaker ensemble and rain spray – all in a self-contained module and is controlled by ThermaTouch.
