Competitors sprint at the start of the Runner's World Half Marathon in front of the Sands Casino Resort Bethjlehem in 2014. (Harry Fisher / THE MORNING CALL) Gary R. Blockus Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call The Runner's World Half Marathon & Festival has become a destination for many because of its connection to the \nCall me crazy, but I will join many others as we tackle the Runner's World Half Marathon and other races this weekend in Bethlehem. \nFrom Friday's trail run in South Mountain Park, to races for kids and dogs at SteelStacks in south Bethlehem, to the ultimate Hat Trick — the Saturday 5K and 10K, followed by Sunday's flagship 13.1-mile half marathon — the Runner's World Half Marathon & Festival has become a destination for many because of its connection to the iconic magazine. \nIt's also a favorite for locals who love the challenge of the hills and the ability to jump into a variety of races on a single weekend. \nAnd it's the only race that also is a multiday festival, with seminars, speakers and running gear for sale in the ArtsQuest Center. If you forgot shorts, blew out a running shoe, need a runner's watch, running bottles and snacks, the festival has it all, including a half marathon eve pasta dinner with two seatings, plus live bands for Sunday's half marathon. \nThis year, Olympic marathon bronze medalist Deena Kastor will sign autographs at 3 p.m. Saturday at the Runner's World Bookstore at the ArtsQuest Center, followed by a 3:45 p.m. Q&A with Runner's World editor David Willey and a 5 p.m. Runner's World Editors Happy Hour at the expo floor bar. \nRunner's World is expecting about 6,000 participants, including kids and dogs, and the city of Bethlehem is bracing for an influx of 15,000-20,000 spectators throughout the weekend, excited to cheer on their families and friends. \nFor the first time, runners will have the opportunity to run the total 26.2 miles of a full marathon over the three days of racing through the iconic historic streets — and now trails — of Bethlehem. From the 1741 Moravian settlement to the former Bethlehem Steel complex, to South Mountain above Lehigh University, history abounds on the race courses. \nNew this year is the Altra 3.8-mile trail run presented by REI on Friday. That race, added to the Hat Trick (5-kilometer, 10-kilometer on Saturday and the half marathon on Sunday), equals the distance of a full 26.2-mile marathon. \nRunners can also choose to do the Five and Dime, which is the 5K and 10K on Saturday. And, if you liked the race course changes last year, you'll be happy to know that the courses have not changed. \nI'm one of the crazy ones doing the Hat Trick plus the trail run, and anyone who knows the 200-plus-pound me knows this is a task of monumental proportion. I'm attempting just to finish each race, with the creeping feeling all the orthopedic surgeons I know have me on speed dial for noon on Sunday to see if I require their services yet again. \nFor the second straight year, runners also have the opportunity to take part in the Pink 16.2 Challenge, which incorporates the annual 5K Women's Classic in Allentown that takes place Saturday, with the Runner's World Half Marathon on Sunday. Runners completing in this combination have pink race bibs to raise awareness for the fight against women's cancers. \nOnline registration closed Oct. 12, but registration will be accepted on-site for Saturday's 5K and 10K, as well as advance registration for Sunday's half marathon. There is no day-of registration for the half. Runners can pick up their bibs on the morning of the race. \nDon't forget that if you have running shoes or clothing you're looking to get rid of, you can donate it on site. \nAnd even before the 2015 Runner's World Half Marathon & Festival begins, there is news for 2016. \nRunner's World and St. Luke's University Health Network and the Lehigh Valley Road Runners are teaming up to offer a special Half & Half 26.2 for the first 250 runners entering both the St. Luke's Half Marathon on April 24, and the Runner's World Half Marathon on Oct. 16, 2016. While both races are open to anyone, the Half & Half includes some perks. Runners can check out this unique Lehigh Valley double at runsignup.com/Race/PA/LehighValley/HalfandHalfMarathon. \nHere's a look of what's going on this weekend. And if you see an overweight, gray-haired guy chugging and puffing and looking pained, give him a cheer and encouragement. I can certainly use it. \nFRIDAY \nTHE ALTRA 3.8-MILE TRAIL RUN PRESENTED BY REI \nWhen: 3 p.m. \nWhere: In South Mountain Park off Mountain Drive West, Bethlehem \nPacket pick up: Opens 1:30 p.m. at South Mountain Park, Mountain Drive North and East University Avenue \nKIDS RACES \nWhat: Races of 1/4, 1/2 and 1 mile for three age groups: 2-5, 6-8 and 9-12 . \nWhen: 5 p.m. \nWhere: SteelStacks, First Street and Founders Way \nHow much: Free \nRegister: Kids can register in person on -site. \nSATURDAY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:51:26.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
