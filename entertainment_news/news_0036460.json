On Friday, Nov. 20 at 6:30 p.m. at Mattison’s Forty-One, guests will discover the exotic aroma and flavor of the wild truffle – harvested directly from Italy. The chefs will bring Tuscany to the table and discuss the hunting of wild truffles, truffle dogs and the stories surrounding the wildly expensive mushroom-like delight adored by gourmets. Covelli, a culinary instructor in Italy and Sarasota resident, began hunting for the Tuscan truffles last week for the event. The chefs prep and cook everything from scratch with the 2 pounds of truffles that are shipped back from Tuscany.\n“When you see what the Florida Winefest & Auction does for children, it truly touches your heart,” says Covelli, a board member of the nonprofit. “Florida Winefest board members have seen a 14-year-old boy cry because he received his first pair of sneakers ever. It really gets you choked up, and you can’t help but be passionate about the good work the organization does for local children.”\nThe dinner will also be perfectly paired with superior wines presented by Banfi Vintners. During the cocktail hour, Stoli Vodka will provide the Stoli martini bar. Proceeds from this event will benefit qualified charitable organizations for programs assisting disadvantaged children.\n“I am so proud to be a part of this nonprofit organization that has awarded $8 million in grants to 84 charities since 1991,” says Mattison.\nTickets are $250 per person, and space is limited to only 100 guests.
