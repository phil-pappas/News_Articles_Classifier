Highly damaging stories had been fabricated; personal information had been obtained via intercepted voicemail messages – causing her to accuse friends and family of selling stories.\nSienna Miller went without makeup in Burnt : ''There’s no vanity in that world.''\nTowards the end of the questioning, Miller was asked why she was giving evidence to the inquiry. Her response was, \"Because you made me?\"\nAdvertisement She was only partly joking. Sitting cross-legged on a couch in a Beverly Hills hotel room during a junket for her latest movie, the gritty restaurant drama-food porn extravaganza Burnt, Miller's persecution by the tabloids is clearly not on the menu.\n\"I have nothing more to say on the subject,\" she says, so early in the interview that she has actually not said anything on the subject. Suddenly, Southern California's October heatwave takes a turn for the chilly.\nSienna Miller spoke passionately at the Leveson Inquiry into the British phone-tapping scandal.\n\"I understand that it's interesting!\" she says. \"It's just been so well documented that I don't know that I have anything unique to say about it.\"\nIt turns out that Miller has plenty of unique things to say about it, even if, in this interview, she does so in the manner of someone enduring a difficult dental procedure.\nIn the past year, Miller's had \"the best experience of my life, creatively\", playing a particularly feisty Sally Bowles in Cabaret on Broadway, and supporting roles in two critically acclaimed films, Foxcatcher and American Sniper .\nSienna Miller says her fight against the News empire \"was a battle that I’m really glad that I fought\".

She relished the sweaty anti-glamour of the kitchen and the role.\n\"There's no way that a woman in that environment working 17-hour days is going to be wearing makeup, so I didn't wear any,\" she says.\n\"There's no vanity in that world. There can't be. Because it's not about how you look – you're cooking in 120-degree heat and you're sweating and exhausted. I'm very willing to look however I need to look to portray the character that I'm playing and that felt right for her.\"\nSienna Miller, as an ambitious chef, with Bradley Cooper in her new movie Burnt .\nIt would be disingenuous to reflect on Miller's recent upwards trajectory without touching on the low point that preceded it.\nMiller's relationship with celebrity was fraught right from the beginning – a poisoned chalice without the chalice. She was only 21 when she started seeing her Alfie co-star Jude Law and attracted the prurient interest of the British tabloids.\n\"It happened so quickly with me,\" Miller says.\n\"It happened before I had a film come out. So I never really ... It wasn't something that I was eased into. It was complicated.\"\nThe complications, such as they were, were of the type that result in drooling headlines and intrusive photographs in gossip magazines. First, the news broke that Law had an affair with his children's nanny.\nMiller, the Daily Mail reported, then gave Law \"a taste of his own medicine\", having an affair with her Layer Cake co-star Daniel Craig. Not long after Law and Miller broke off their engagement, pictures of Miller were splashed across tabloid pages yet again, first alongside Welsh actor Rhys Ifans, then actor Balthazar Getty, who was married with four children.\nThe quick-fire succession of scandals proved to be a distraction from Miller's early acting career.\n\"Working on films was my dream,\" Miller says.\n\"The other side of it [the unwanted attention] was something which, initially, I was trying to understand and accept.\n\"I understand that a part of that comes with the territory. Of course, when people start to be interested in you and your life, it means to a certain degree you're succeeding in the field you want to succeed in.\"\nIn a less guarded interview earlier this year, Miller appeared to confess to feeling some guilt over her scandal-generating behaviour. She seemed more straightforwardly regretful about how her wild, party girl reputation affected the work she was getting.\n\"I burnt a lot of bridges,\" she said.\nBut Miller is well aware that she was specifically and viciously targeted. \"It just became aggressive the way that I was exposed to it,\" she tells me.\n\"I just knew that the way that it was being done wasn't legal and I wasn't going to sit back and accept that.\"\nFinally, Miller took a stand. In a landmark case in 2009, she won an injunction against major British celebrity photograph agency Big Pictures and was awarded £53,000 ($112,000) in damages and costs; she spoke out against the News International \"empire\" (as she called it during her testimony) at the Leveson Inquiry two years later.\n\"I felt the need as a person to fight legally because I couldn't handle that level of attention and scrutiny and public dissection in the unhealthy way that it was being done,\" she says.\n\"And so I fought very hard to get laws implemented that meant that I could lead a different sort of life. And it was a battle that I'm really glad that I fought.\"\nWith the tabloids taking it down a notch and the paparazzi thoroughly backing off, Miller believes that, in recent years, she's been able to snag more work and better roles.\n\"I think the lack of that media attention means that people are able to see you as different people in your films.\n\"To a certain degree, in order to be taken seriously and really believable as a character, you have to work quite hard for people to not have a very strong perception of your everyday existence. That's difficult when you're being photographed every day.\"\nAs well as the release of Burnt this week, the dystopian sci-fi High Rise , in which Miller stars with Tom Hiddleston, is currently on the film festival circuit; in August, she shot the action adventure The Lost City of Z ; she begins shooting the thriller Live By Night , scripted and directed by Ben Affleck, in November. And she's currently in talks for more stage roles: \"West End, Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway…\"\nMiller and her partner of three years, Far From the Madding Crowd actor Tom Sturridge​, ended their engagement earlier this year, but Miller visibly brightens – at last – describing life with their three-year-old daughter, Marlowe.\n\"Having a child is the most transformative thing that can happen to a person,\" she says.\n\"It changes absolutely everything. It's really suited me to be able to pop in and do interesting roles that are small but impactful in big films. Now, if I want to work, I want it to be something I'm incredibly passionate about to justify not being at home.\"\nAs Miller has asserted control over her life, occasional tabloid attempts to dish dirt have become increasingly desperate: last year, Star magazine accused her of drunkenly \"devouring a stack of cucumber slices (they were supposed to be the garnish!)\" at an Oscars party.\n\"My life has changed enormously,\" Miller says. \"It's a very different life because I'm free to live it.\"\nBurnt is in cinemas now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:25:42.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
