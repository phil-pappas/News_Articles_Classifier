Promoted stories \nCharlie Hislop, of Southampton Festivals and one of the founders of SO: To Speak, said: “It is fantastic to finally welcome SO: To Speak into Southampton. It is strongly rooted in our stories, our history, and our creative talent. We have a great programme on offer over the next ten days, from CSI Southampton to Spitfires to illustration workshops, that there is something for everyone. Being half term means there is also great opportunity for families to get involved and make the most of the festival. We hope that the events inspire those who attend and also show what a vibrant and creative city Southampton really is.” Share article \nJani Frank, from the Arthouse and contributor to SO: To Speak, added: “Over the last few months so many people have come together to make this festival a reality – it’s brilliant to now show the city what we have been working on and I hope everyone enjoys the programme we have put together. There is so much creative talent on the south coast and this festival aims to showcase Southampton’s dynamic and growing cultural identity.” \nFor further information please visit www.sotospeakfestival.org or to purchase tickets call the Mayflower Box Office on 02380 711811.
