In the newly released trailer for Marvel's Jessica Jones , we see her doing a victory shot after taking down a full bar of bad guys. Sadly, we don't see her showing off her super powers -- which include super strength and the ability to fly -- but clearly she knows how to handle herself against goons! The Netflix exclusive is part of their ongoing deal with Marvel. They just released some promo shots a couple of weeks ago, and it looks amazing . All 13 episodes of Jessica Jones will be released on Friday, Nov. 20 on Netflix.
