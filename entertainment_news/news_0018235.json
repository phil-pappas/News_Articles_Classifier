Gautam Rode, who was previously seen in Mahakumbh, is back after a break with Suryaputra Karn. In a candid chat he tells us about his hiatus, the upcoming show, his interest in mythology and more.\nHow did you enjoy your little break from daily soaps?\nIt was a good two-month break as I got the opportunity to travel and spend some quality time with my family and friends. I was in Abu Dhabi and Dubai for a bit — it helped me destress. But by the end of it, I missed shooting for shows as I am a workaholic and I love my work.\nHow did Suryaputra Karn happen?\nThe channel approached me earlier as well but my dates were with Mahakumbh and hence I had to decline. My role in the show was meant to be — the entry of elder Karn was postponed and Mahakumbh too finished its finite run. The date issues were finally sorted and here I am, playing Karn.\nHow different is shooting for a mythological show?\nMythological shows are characters we have read about in our religious books and stories we have heard growing up.\nHence, there is a certain responsibility that comes with playing a fabled character. The character’s attitude has to be true to people’s belief and one can only take so much creative liberty.\nHow interested in mythology are you in real life?\nI find mythology interesting but at the same time I am not one of those who would actively seek out mythology books or shows to read.\nBuzz is that you have signed an international show?\nIt’s too early to talk about it as the show has been postponed. I would rather talk about it once things are more concrete.\n Gautam Rode entertainment television Mahakumbh Also Read Will Farhan be cast opposite Sonam after Fawad's exit?
