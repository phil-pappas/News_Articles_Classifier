Just when you think animal cruelty towards an innocent animal couldn't get any worse, another tale - even more egregious, rears its ugly head.\nRescue Dogs Rock NYC View all 5 photos Rescue Dogs Rock NYC Fortunately, September 25 was a lucky day for the little puppy when a witness was able to grab the puppy away and extinguish the flames just as he was set on fire. Brought to the Okefenokee Humane Society, and dubbed Inferno, the staff rushed the brown and white pooch for emergency treatment. He suffered severe burns to his back, shoulder, ear and hip. When Rescue Dogs Rock NYC was called to help Inferno, Stacey Silverstein, founder of the organization immediately stepped up. \"We do not know why someone would possess such evil and hatred to cause such pain on a living breathing being,\" stated Stacey.\nNow renamed Izzy, the little guy is being treated at the Fayetteville Animal Hospital . He is expected to remain there for extended treatment until he is well enough to be transported to New York City where he will be placed in a foster home and be eligible for adoption when healed. \"Izzy is only 4 months old ...an innocent puppy... The pain and trauma he has suffered in his short life is unconscionable. Take a moment and watch Izzy's video by clicking here, and then ask yourself the same question as Stacey ... \"how could anyone inflict such pain and misery on an innocent puppy?\" How incredible, however to watch tiny little Izzy continue to be so friendly and wag his tail happily at everyone who offers him an affectionate hug.\nRescue Dogs Rock NYC have taken on dozens of serious cases in the last few weeks which have amounted to extraordinary veterinary expenses ensuring these dogs receive the best of care.
