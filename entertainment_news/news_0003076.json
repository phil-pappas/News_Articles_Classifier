Many of you might know Tim Finn. For years Tim could be found at Finn's Garage on East Main Street, where he ran the business before retiring and leaving the garage in the capable hands of his son Kevin.\nOne of the ways he keeps busy these days is by growing pumpkins. And this year he outdid himself big time. This year he nurtured one of his pumpkins to an astounding 1434 pounds.\nTim nurtured the amazing pumpkin from a hybrid seed he picked up in Nova Scotia while traveling with his wife Maureen. He planted it in his home on April 20, carefully nurturing it and transplanting it outside only when he was certain the weather had turned warm for good.\nThe result was a mammoth pumpkin which rested in a sea of leaves that took up about 800 feet of his garden.\nThe big weigh-in took place on October 3 at the 2015 CNY Pumpkin Fest. Tim's entry was one of 36 pumpkins trucked to Oswego for the event, so taking fourth place was quite an achievement. It's hard to believe any pumpkin could have been bigger, but the winner (nicknamed \"Big Earl\") tipped the scale at a whopping 1534 pounds.\nAfter Tim's pumpkin returned to town, it rested briefly at a farm market in Ontario. But after only a short time, it was sold for $100.\nI guess someone REALLY likes to make pumpkin pies.\nThank you to my journalistic colleague and friend Carol Klem for this story.\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:04:12.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
