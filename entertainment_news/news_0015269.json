He hosted the April 3, 2004, episode of the late-night sketch series, which aired when he was still on NBC's reality series \"The Apprentice.\" \"Saturday Night Live's\" Nov. 7 episode also features musical guest Sia.\nThis news marks the second time NBC has reneged on its threats to sever ties with Trump after he made \"derogatory\" comments about immigrants when he announced his presidential campaign. The mogul appeared on the Sept. 11 episode of \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" where he happily poked fun at himself but also dodged serious questions about his plans to carry out policies. The episode gave Fallon his highest Friday ratings in 18 months.\nThe third episode of the season airs this weekend with host Tracy Morgan.\nNo more nudes in Playboy...
