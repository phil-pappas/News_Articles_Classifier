However, the film is set in California where the San Andreas Fault is a constant threat. \nHelicopter rescue pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is brooding over his impending divorce from Emma (Carla Gugino​), who has formed a new relationship with rich architect Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd​) when a massive earthquake hits Los Angeles. Ray's thoughts immediately swing to his family, especially his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario​), as chaos overtakes the city.\nAdvertisement The film has a good cast including Paul Giamatti​ as a seismologist – who features in a scary scene depicting the destruction of the Hoover Dam – and, presumably in a nod to its filming location, even Kylie Minogue pops up in a cameo.\nJohnson may not be the world's greatest actor but he's an amiable presence who knows his limitations and works well within them and he and the other actors keep you interested in the story and the characters. \nThere are plenty of extras on the Blu-ray including a director's commentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary and featurettes.\nRon Cerabona", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:52:35.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
