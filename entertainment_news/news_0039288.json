Justin Bieber was just one of Ed Sheeran's famous friends at his movie premiere - see the pics! \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nEd Sheeran was out and about in Leicester Square for the premiere of his tour documentary Jumpers For Goalposts. \nIt tells the story of Ed’s sold-out Wembley Stadium tour, which took place over three dates in July. \nThe man of the moment, kitted out in Armani, was wondering if anybody would turn up. But with a few famous friends, it seemed to go pretty well for the Thinking Out Loud singer. Thank you Armarni for making me look smart. En route now #edcarpet https://t.co/4lSna00uVY \n— Ed Sheeran (@edsheeran) October 22, 2015 \nWhile walking the #EdCarpet, Ed said: “I didn’t think anyone was going to turn up. I’ve never had a film in a cinema. It’s quite a weird thing for a musician to be doing this in Leicester Square so it’s cool.” \nSo just who turned up?
