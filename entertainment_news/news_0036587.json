Additional concessions from small parcel carriers allowed the home goods supplier to make this cut and pass along savings to customers. This change comes in addition an earlier seven percent drop in shipping costs that Organize-It made in June of this year.\nOrganize-It knows that most customers, \"prefer lower shipping [costs] as opposed to expedited [shipping],\" and hopes that customers will take advantage of the savings, said Warehouse Manager Todd Parent.\nResults from the Pitney Bowes' 2015 Holiday Shipping Survey show that Organize-It customers are not alone. Eighty-eight percent of online shoppers value price over speed in regard to shipping. With the holiday shopping season fast approaching, Organize-It recognizes customer's ever important need to save money.\nThe same survey found that shoppers are planning to spread out their purchases across the entire season. Parent said that the holiday influx typically picks up around the tail end of October. With this in mind, Organize-It is glad to implement this reduction now to best accommodate customers this coming holiday season.\nOrganize-It prides itself on being a leader in online shopping and is always working to offer the best in selection, customer service and over-all shopping experience to their customers.\nAn independent retailer established in 1997, Organize-It works with a growing number of vendors to provide the best in storage, organizing and home products, including: closet organizers, kitchen gadgets, laundry organizers, garage cabinets and office wares.
