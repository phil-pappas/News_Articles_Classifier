No official words were out in the bag yet. However, author E.L. James engaged in social media postings the past week and the photos she hsared were teasing of behind-the-scene development of the second installment. Like Us on Facebook \nIn an Oct. 22 tweet , James tweeted \"fun times\" and then tagged \"Fifty Shades Darker\" director James Foley and producers Dana Brunetti and Michael de Luca. The tweet included a link to a photo posted on her Instagram account that shows her inside a board room with screenwriter/ husband Niall Leonard, Brunetti and Foley. Another Instagram post from James was a photo of the outside of De Luca's office at NBC Universal Comcast. Her hashtag reads \"Working.\" \nCuriously, an account on Twitter which goes by the handler Fifty Shades Online tweeted a photo which seemed like a minutes of the meeting. The post tagged James, Leonard, de Luca, Foley and Brunetti. The picture shows the official synopsis of the \"Fifty Shades Darker\" book and a release date which states February 10, 2017. This date had already been confirmed in the past by The Hollywood Reporter as the official day when the second franchise bows on cinemas. The photo also indicated casting as Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. \nAside from Johnson and Dornan who had long since been confirmed to reprise their roles as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, there had been no new casting that has been announced yet. In a recent interview with E! Online , Brunetti said that they have not gotten into anything in as far as additional casting is concern. He stressed that any casting rumors are at this point just rumors. \nJohnson meanwhile hinted that she had already met with Foley. Asked by Empire magazine about how she felt about the director change, Johnson said she felt excited. \n\"There was a moment of being afraid, because I didn't know what it was going to be like. Now I'm excited. I think James is a talented filmmaker,\" the actress told Empire. Asked to compare Foley's directing style with the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" director, Sam Taylor-Johnson's style, Johnson teased: \"you'll just have to see when the movie comes out.\" In an April interview with THR , Universal Pictures chairman Donna Langley said \"Fifty Shades darker\" will be more of a thriller.
