It opens with the soft and soulful ' Bandeyaa' . The composition by Amjad Nadeem borders on Sufi while singer Jubin Nautiyal gets in power mode. ' Bandeyaa' Reprise at the end of the album has singer Asees Kaur hitting the right notes, but not as well as Nautiyal. ' Kahaaniya' is like a workout number. Written and composed by Arko, it has Ash showing off her fine frame post maternity. Singer Nilofer Wani has even sung it like an ad commercial. 'Jaane Tere Shehar' is a ghazal that seems the right fit for the sombre Irrfan. Vipin Aneja doesn't sound like Jagjit Singh but the song does remind one of Koyi Fariyaad (Tum Bin). We're guessing Irrfan is professing his one-sided love for Ash's character in this one. This is one of the more mature songs to feature in a Sanjay Gupta film's soundtrack. Aaj Raat Ka Scene takes the mood into party mode. Badshah of ' DJ Waley Babu' repeats his finesse with party songs after ' Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai' (Khoobsurat). Shraddha Pandit has a mischievous glint in her voice for this one.\nLISTEN: Songs of Jazbaa on Gaana.com\nWATCH: Jazbaa | Official Trailer | Irrfan Khan & Aishwarya Rai Bachchan | 9th October", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/search/songs/Jazbaa", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx7z1enCLWs"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:00:39.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
