Back | Next Ben Goggins/For Savannah Morning News Do you think the woman in the foreground below the Pope is excited? By BEN GOGGINS\nSometimes you know that God is really smiling on you. Sometimes it’s for a good stretch of days.\nAnd so it was for me last month when I was “chosen” to see the pope in Washington. Being an alumnus of Catholic University, I was able to enter a lottery to attend the Canonization Mass for Father Junipero Serra at the National Shrine on Sept. 23. And, sweet Jesuits, darn if I didn’t win a ticket.\nBefore my trip, I was going over in my mind what to say to the pope if we had a few quiet moments. Hey, anything is possible. And I got some material for that on the day before I flew.\nSept. 21 was the International Day of Peace. I had lunch downtown with ladies Lynda Beam, Laura Lawton, Kennedy Braden, the Rev. Jan Durham and other members of the Savannah: City of Peace group.\nThey showed me the proclamation adopted earlier in the month by the mayor and council in which Savannah joined the International Cities of Peace network. Mayor Edna Jackson had received the idea enthusiastically and plans to encourage every organization and individual to build on Savannah’s historic tradition of peacefulness.\nI was explaining to Braden how, to be declared a saint, the Catholic Church has to officially credit two miracles to a person; in this case Serra, who founded many California missions in the 18th century. She made the observation, “Doesn’t everyone perform two miracles?” I made a note to share that with the pope.\nExcitement about the pope was evident everywhere. The Delta gate agent for the Atlanta-to-Washington flight on Sept. 22 reminded passengers, “The Pope arrives today; I hope you see him.”\nI was staying with a college friend, Lennie, and took the Metro to Silver Spring. In the underground sections, you could hear a harmonic sound from the rails, like organ music from a distant radio. One passenger said it sounded like Gregorian chant and that maybe they had tuned the tracks for the pope.\nEven the heavily tagged walls before and after the Metro stop at Catholic University were full of fresh papal graffiti. Red stencils of the Pope’s mitre, “DC loves Papa Francesco,” and silhouettes of St. Francis garden statues.\nThat evening I was looking forward to meeting, for the very first time, an old friend of my wife’s. I had never met Little Sister Francisca, but she inspired my wife no end. In the 1980s, my wife got to know her on trips to D.C. to visit our daughter, to honor friends at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and to help at a Catholic Worker House.\nFrancisca invited me and Lennie for dinner. When we stepped into her small apartment, where I had never been, it was a homecoming. There were the same lovely terra cotta statues that sit gracefully in our Tybee home. So here, I saw, was the source of those gifts; this was the woman who gave us those statues that convey such kindness and simplicity.\nFrancisca talked about the statues and how they were visions that had come to the Little Sisters of Jesus foundress in her dreams. One statue is of Mary extending a smiling baby Jesus before her, as a gift to the world. The other statue is of the infant in a crib, grinning like he’s just been tickled.\nFrancisca is the same age as the pope and was sent to the U.S. from her native Belgium at age 19, not knowing a word of English. She calls her small apartment, in an immigrant-rich area of D.C., her hermitage. It is a warm place with a mission of friendship.\nThen, dawn of the big day Sept. 23 arrived. For good luck I had quince jam on toast at Lennie’s. That’s what the pope likes for breakfast, and I was prepared to shout, “Me gusta membrillo,” to get his attention if he passed close enough.\nThe sunny day was perfect. The Mass was celebrated outside on the east portico of the shrine, facing the green grassy mall of Catholic University. The Jumbotron screens made every part of the service easy to see.\nThe prelude music that came from the orchestra and choirs in the shrine was uplifting. The program included Aaron Copeland’s “Simple Gifts” and “Zion’s Walls;” Donna Peña’s “Mi Alma Está Sedienta de Ti” and Richard Proulx’ “Ecce quam bonum.”\nJust before he arrived, the pope’s motorcade traveled the closed road behind the shrine where a large group of people with special needs were assembled. The pope paused there and lovingly touched the heads of numerous children and adults. One little boy on crutches dropped the holy card that he was holding for the pope to bless, and the pope bent over to pick it up.\nThat gentle touch carried through the entire ceremony. The relics of Junipero Serra were presented to the pope by two Native Americans of the California Ohlone tribe. The scripture reading from Isaiah was in the native Chochenyo language.\nIn his homily, the pope acknowledged mistreatment and injury suffered by Native Americans in Serra’s day. But he described the new saint’s commitment to heal, to show mercy and love, to increase in holiness, to “keep moving forward.”\nIntentions were offered by readers in Korean, American Sign Language, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Igbo and Creole. The offertory gifts were brought up by members of local parishes. After delivering hers to the pope, one cute little Vietnamese girl in a bright red dress could not take her eyes off him. Her mother was holding her hand, keeping her from falling, as she nearly tripped on every step, looking over her shoulders to see what he was doing next.\nThe sign of peace shared before communion was a real global brotherhood. I shook hands with men and women from Togo, Kenya, and Mexico, as well as plenty of Californians and D.C.-area locals.\nDuring communion, “The Prayer of St. Francis” played. The pope’s thoughtful face on the Jumbotron screens looked like an orthodox icon, the pixilation resembling chips in a Renaissance mosaic.\nThe mass ended and everyone went in peace and with obvious enthusiasm. People on the Metro were talking about the joy of the day. People at the restaurant where we ate that night were high-fiving about it.\nI was reminded at dinner for three with Little Sister Francisca, and at mass for 25,000 with the pope, how important simple truths are. How joy radiates, and, like the conservation of energy in physics, goodwill continues outward. Encouragement breeds encouragement.\nNever doubt how much it means to touch someone else gently on the head, to bless them with a smile and a kind word. I saw kids on the metro ride home reenacting just that to eachpother.\nTwo days later, the pope was at the podium at the interfaith service at Ground Zero. He was leaning forward with the same gentleness, the same grace, as Little Sister Francisca’s statue of Mary. His humble posture, the curve of his back and shoulders, was the same as hers.\nMary, presenting her child as a happy gift to the world. Pope Francis, presenting a call for all in the world to be channels of peace. In her hands, Jesus. In his voice and in his words of comfort, echoes of the same gift.\nBen Goggins, a retired marine biologist, lives on Tybee Island.
