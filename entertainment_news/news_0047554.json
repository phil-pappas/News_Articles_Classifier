It was only a matter of time before somebody thought of combining the two, and in this case the wonderful result is Meow the Jewels. \nDon’t believe us? Check out remix track Meowrly. \nIf you liked that, you can download the entire thing FOR FREE on Run the Jewels’ website . \n“But who are those lucky cats sampled on Meow the Jewels?” we hear you cry. The contributing meow-er is none other than the internet’s favourite kitties, Lil Bub, amongst a host of other furry friends. \nIt started out as a Kickstarter campaign, and raised a whopping $65,700 to convince artists Killer Mike and El-P, who together make Run the Jewels, to remix their Run the Jewels 2 album with cat noises. \nThe creator of the Kickstarter page has confirmed that El-P will donate his share of the funds to the families of Eric Garner and Mike Brown, who both died after controversial incidents involving US police officers. \nEl-P told Deadspin : “I would never even insult the world by saying [the album is] ‘good,’ but it’s certainly the high-water mark for cat-sound records, I think.” \nJust when you thought this cat-rap fusion couldn’t get any better, someone’s only gone and made a music video for one of the tracks. And yes, it involves giant cats taking over a city. Share article \nFurther proof that cats rule the world. Now will someone PLEASE start a Kickstarter page for Kanye West’s Yeezus to be remixed with Grumpy Cat’s purrs? Meowsus would make a great title.
