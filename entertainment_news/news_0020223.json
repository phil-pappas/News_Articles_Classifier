(Mike Coppola / Getty Images) Michael Phillips Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Hollywood's female troubles aren't only about the money, Tribune's Michael Phillips writes. \nEarlier this month Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner for \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" let loose with an essay sparked by a financial revelation. At 25, she may be the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning (according to Forbes) a cool $52 million in the fiscal year ending June 2015. But Lawrence made considerably less than her male co-stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner while working on director David O. Russell's \"American Hustle.\" \nLawrence's essay was a call to arms. It was also a confession. Posted to Lena Dunham's online forum Lenny Letter, it quickly became a national talking point — in part because the \"Hunger Games\" star and \"X-Men\" ensemble player pointed the finger at herself as well as others. \nAfter seeing the salary numbers revealed by the leaked Sony documents, \"I didn't get mad at Sony,\" Lawrence wrote. \"I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. ... I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled.' … This could be a young-person thing. It could be a personality thing. I'm sure it's both. But this is an element of my personality that I've been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don't think I'm the only woman with this issue.\" \nLawrence summed it up: \"I'm over trying to find the 'adorable' way to state my opinion and still be likable.\" \nWith that sentence, how many women and men around the world nodded, or muttered, \"Damn right,\" or silently thanked America's A-lister of choice at the exact same moment? \nLawrence left out one thing, though. Her essay implies that pay inequity is Hollywood's most damaging sin. It isn't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:40:40.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
