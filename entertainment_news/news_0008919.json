Image 21 of 21 San Antonio-Austin rivalry now a movie! 1 / 21 Back to Gallery SAN ANTONIO -- That age-old rivalry that seems to be heating up again of late -- Austin vs. San Antonio -- has inspired a thought-provoking feature film.\nBest of all, the budding filmmaker, Noi Mahoney, is inviting the public to a free screening Saturday at a small San Antonio theater.\n\"Austin vs. San Antonio\" will bow here at 3:30 p.m. Saturday at SAY Sí's Black Box Theatre, 1518 S. Alamo St.\nSpace is limited, so arrive early; seating is on a first-come, first-served basis.\nSomething tells me the cheering section for the Alamo City portion of the documentary will dominate -- particularly when talk of the Spurs comes up.\nActually, the love for San Antonio's NBA team is one of the things that both cities have in common.\n\"I found out while making the movie that there also are a lot of Spurs fans in Austin,\" Mahoney said.\nHe describes his film, which runs a little more than an hour and is divided into two sections --- San Antonio and Austin -- as \"a fun, colorful scrapbook of information and recollections.\"\nPhotographs and footage throughout the doc highlight the beauty and striking looks of both cities. It features 27 voices from a wide age range. These include artists, writers, restaurateurs, actors, musicians, public officials and more from both Austin and San Antonio.\nBexar County Judge Nelson Wolff , a former San Antonio mayor, says he's proud of the close relationship enjoyed by San Antonio and Mexico.\n\"We're an international city,\" Wolff says. \"We reflect the incoming demographics across the United States. We're very much a Mexican city, when you look at the United States, we're closer to Mexico, friendship wise, economics wise, relatives, friends. than any other city in the United States.\"\nFormer Austin Chronicle music writer Margaret Moser, who grew up in San Antonio but moved to Austin in 1973, opines: \"Austin defines itself on music, politics and football.\"\nJim Beal Jr, who wrote about music for the San Antonio Express-News for years, says: \"One of the misconceptions about san Antonio is it's strictly a heavy metal town. S.A. started being a vital jazz town in the 1920s. ... It's part of the birthplace of conjunto music and Tejano music.\"\nNikki Young, a San Antonio-based actress and producer, speaks of the rich history of film production in San Antonio, starting with \"Wings,\" the 1927 movie filmed here that won the award for Outstanding Picture at the first Academy Awards. \"(San Antonio) was the original Hollywood,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, due to whatever multiple reasons -- there wasn't enough support, economic support in the community -- (film production) fled.\n\"Austin decided to take ownership,\" she added. \"They decided they wanted to be the film capital of the state. So we didn't claim it. We lost it. They got it.\"\nAndy Benavides, local artist and activist, calls San Antonio \"the land of mañana.\"\n\"Everybody's so laid back; it moves at a different pace,\" he says. \"You can work hard and also find that time to just stop.\"\nS.A. artist Aaron Forland credits our NBA team with giving San Antonio the oomph it craved.\n\"I always felt the Spurs' championships gave the city the boost of self-confidence that it sorely needed,\" Forland says.\nHe and fellow Alamo City artist Justin Parr were responsible for the slogan \"Keep San Antonio Lame\" in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek response to \"Keep Austin Weird.\"\nThe response here was surprisingly very positive, they recall.\nWhat are some of the pluses of each city that Mahoney took away from his two years of filming \"Austin vs. San Antonio\"?\n\"People are less pretentious in San Antonio,\" the Holmes High graduate and UT Austin alumnus said in a phone chat. \"Austin has that cooler-than-everybody-else mentality. The people there seem ruled more by fads. Everything has to be hip and cool.\"\nIn San Antonio, by contrast, \"you can wear your flip-flops and T-shirt and no one will give you a second look.\"\nIn Austin's positive column, however, he said: \"You can go there and reinvent yourself. ... You have the feeling you can be more creative there as long as you work hard enough at it.\"\nBest conclusion from his research? \"It's a very exciting time to live in both San Antonio and Austin. It's cool that we have these two cities that are so close together that are so different and with such unique culture, yet they somehow complement each other.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/37/70/6946311/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/27/60/17/6226927/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789644/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/50/6457864/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/63/52/7027367/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/52/00/7512100/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/06/34/6317883/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/64/22/6505620/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/32/16/21/6874218/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/14/77/46/3406244/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/37/70/6946311/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/32/16/21/6874218/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/22/15/03/4772050/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/50/6457864/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789648/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789647/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/22/15/03/4772050/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789645/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/13/62/7126179/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/17/76/30/4187706/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/65/34/7034625/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/65/34/7034625/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/33/21/42/7149704/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/63/52/7027367/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/27/60/17/6226927/3/920x920.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3_FGp3sg8M", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789644/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/64/22/6505620/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/17/76/30/4187706/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/44/74/6704922/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/06/34/6317883/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/77/12/6812318/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/13/62/7126179/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789648/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/44/74/6704922/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/14/77/46/3406244/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789647/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/52/00/7512100/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/72/8789645/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/33/21/42/7149704/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/77/12/6812318/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:50:18.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
