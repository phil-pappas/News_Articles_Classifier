The second class of 71 surrendered much of their U.S.-issued ammunition and trucks to Al Nusra Front fighters in exchange for safe passage.\n\"We have clearly faced challenges with the train-and-equip program,\" said one senior administration official familiar with the discussions.\n\"President Obama has been clear that we intend to continue our efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL in Syria,\" the official said, using the administration's preferred acronym for the Islamic State group.\nMeanwhile, the Kurdish militia, backed by U.S. airpower, has proved to be a highly organized and trained ground force.\nKnown as the Popular Protection Units, or YPG, they defeated Islamic State forces in the town of Kobani near the Turkish border in January after a yearlong siege that involved coordinating daily with U.S. warplanes.\nIn June, the Kurds beat the militants again in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad and cut a critical Islamic State supply line for weapons and reinforcements funneling in from Turkey.\n\"That's the kind of more effective approach we're looking at,\" Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in a speech in London on Friday.\n\"The work we've done with the Kurds in Northern Syria is an example of an effective approach where you have a group that is capable, motivated on the ground and you can enable their success,\" he said. \"We and others have been working. That's exactly the kind of example that we'd like to pursue with other groups in other parts of Syria.\"\nUnder the new approach, the administration will continue to work with a range of groups to capitalize on the successes that Kurdish, Arab and Turkmen groups have had over the last several months driving the Islamic State forces out of much of the Turkey-Syria border region.?\nThe Pentagon has signaled there would be a change to the train-and-equip program last month when they put training on hold, saying no new recruits would be allowed out of the training camps.\n\"I wasn't satisfied,\" Carter said.\nOf the $500 million Congress appropriated last year for the Pentagon effort, $41.8 million had been spent as of May.\nThe decision to end the Pentagon training program does not appear to immediately affect a separate program run by the CIA.\n(Hennigan reported from London, and Parsons from Washington.)\n(c)2015 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735361&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735361", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1735361&h=Obama+to+halt+Pentagon+effort+to+train+Syrian+rebels"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:19:34.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
