The union represents 130 teachers in the district. \nThe two sides have a final round of talks scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. Monday. Mancini, who stopped by the Career Day staging area without benefit of sleep, characterized his outlook for a resolution as \"hopeful.\" \nBut students -- and parents -- might go to bed Monday night without knowing whether there will be school Tuesday morning. \nBoth Mancini and union co-president Kim DeLoia declined at the school board meeting Thursday to provide comment on the progress of negotiations or on any points of contention. During the meeting Thursday, DeLoia said she was hopeful that an agreement could be reached. \nThe previous contract, signed in early 2013, froze teacher salaries at 2012 levels, with staff receiving pay increases only as they accumulated seniority. Under that agreement, teachers paid increased amounts toward their health insurance premiums. \nThose negotiations occurred as the district was reeling from reduced state funding of more than $1 million in 2011, part of an estimated $1 billion decline in the state basic education subsidy that year. The cut forced several changes at Ellwood City Area, including closing Walnut Ridge School, to save money. \nFiscal problems in Harrisburg are complicating this year's negotiations as well, said school board Vice President LeRoy Cortez, a vocal and frequent critic of education funding policy in the state Legislature and former Gov. Tom Corbett. \nAfter the 2013 contract agreement, Cortez credited the teachers for making concessions at a difficult time for the district. Things aren't much easier this time around because Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and the Republican-controlled Legislature hasn't been able to agree on a budget for the 2014-15 fiscal year, which began July 1. \nDistricts throughout the state didn't receive their subsidy payment in August and likely won't see the scheduled October payment. Ellwood City, which receives approximately half of its total revenue through the state, is continuing to operate from a budget surplus. \nCortez, a member of the district's negotiations team now and on the 2013 contract, said that even though Ellwood City is managing to pay its bills, the state's failure to release a budget is complicating negotiations with teachers. This budget, the first under Wolf as governor, will establish an education funding baseline until the next election in 2016, he said. \nWithout that certainty, Cortez said it is a challenge to commit spending on salaries. \n\"It's difficult to anticipate revenue when you don't know how much you'll be getting,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:22:18.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
