Starting in March, the magazine will no longer publish photographic images of naked woman. Yes, you read that correctly.\nThe surprising news apparently came out of a meeting between Hugh Hefner and one of the magazine's top editors. With the advent of digital porn (So. Much. Porn. On. The. Internet) executives felt like the magazine that helped take the taboo out of provocative images of sexuality needed a new direction.\n ​\"That battle has been fought and won,\" Scott Flanders, the company's chief executive, told the ​Times . \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passé at this juncture ​.\"\nThe ​Times ​cites declining print sales and the ease of access to digital pornography along with a decline in the \"shock value\" of the kinds of images the magazine was know for. In addition to the change in the print magazine, Playboy's website also stopped publishing nude pics back in August.\nMore From Cosmopolitan Playboy has always had a tricky relationship with feminism ; while many railed against the publication for exploiting women as objects, other feminists hailed it as a pioneering force in the fight for sexual liberation and sex positivity. Lately, Playboy has catered more and more to young feminists , indluding featuring a popular anti-catcalling chart on its website that quickly went viral.\nYou'll still sexy ladies in the magazine, but they just won't be naked. R.I.P, nude Playboy centerfolds. You will be missed by many folks with fond memories.\n​Follow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "http://daily.jstor.org/playboys-complicated-relationship-feminism/", "http://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/6915807/playboy-feminism-lad-mags", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/media/nudes-are-old-news-at-playboy.html?referer=", "http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/pb.php"], "published": "2015-10-13T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:42:06.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
