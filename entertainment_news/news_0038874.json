The director has been closely associated with the Bachchan parivar since the start of his career. Confirming the news, Aishwarya says, “I’ve agreed to do Sujoy’s Durga Rani and the screen adaptation of Keigo Huganshino’s Japanese novel The Devotion Of Suspect X. I don’t know which one he will start first. We are working on that.” Ghosh had worked with Amitabh Bachchan in his second feature film, Alladin, and with Abhishek Bachchan in his third film Home Delivery. Aishwarya says, “I’ve known Sujoy from the time he made his first film Jhankar Beats. He has been offering me films since then. I loved the two films that he offered me now.
