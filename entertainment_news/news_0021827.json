I said, ‘can you not keep bringing it up all the time’,” Frost told KIIS FM’s Hughesy & Kate. “I don’t want to be known as the heartbreak kid. \n“So I’m a bit disappointed watching it back about how many times it is brought up.” \nFrost’s comments come as three bachelors are left in the contest to win her heart: Michael, Richie and Sasha. \nShe said she is looking forward to being open about her new boyfriend once the series winds up. “It’s pretty weird but I’m excited because it means I can get a coffee down the street and actually say my boyfriend’s name,” she said.
