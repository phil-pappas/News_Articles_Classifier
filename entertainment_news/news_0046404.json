The film is being produced by MacGillivray Freeman Films , a leader in the giant-screen film industry.\nASCE recognized Bechtel at the society’s 2015 annual convention in New York City for its generous support as the Dream Big project’s presenting sponsor.\n“I am deeply grateful to the Bechtel Corporation for their support, which has been integral to the success of the fundraising campaign led by the ASCE Foundation,” said Jon Magnusson, P.E., S.E., Hon.AIA, Dist.M.ASCE, president of the ASCE Foundation and technical advisor to the film. “I am personally excited to see Dream Big enter the production phase and come to life on the screen and through the outreach component.”\nThe Dream Big project is both a 3D giant-screen film and large-scale outreach program designed to transform the understanding of and interest in engineering, science and technology and open new opportunities for engineering, especially for children in grades K-12. The project seeks to bolster academic achievement, student engagement and parent involvement and is one of the largest public awareness and outreach projects on engineering ever conceived.\n“Every day, engineers bring creativity, discipline and passion to their work. The film will show how engineers dream big to create a sustainable future and better quality of life for people everywhere,” said Charlene Wheeless, head of Global Corporate Affairs at Bechtel Corporation. “The production also gives us a fresh way to reach out to girls, a group that we know from countless research studies is less likely to pursue STEM careers.”\n“Through the Dream Big initiative ASCE aims to educate the public about the awe-inspiring work of civil and other engineers around the globe, while motivating students to get excited about and see engineering in an entirely different light,” said Robert D. Stevens, Ph.D., P.E., president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. “We hear a lot about the science, technology and math in STEM education. This film will share in a revolutionary way what’s especially exciting about the “E” in STEM. My sincere thanks to our many partners and generous sponsors, without whom none of this would have been possible.”\n“The giant-screen film medium is the perfect format for communicating all that is exciting and innovative about the work of engineers, and we are extremely excited to bring their work to life in the immersive IMAX theatre setting,” said Greg MacGillivray, two-time Academy Award-nominated director of Dream Big and Chairman of MacGillivray Freeman Films. “The film will put viewers right in the heart of the action, whether it’s climbing to the top of the world’s tallest building, soaring over a bridge so tall it extends above the clouds or speeding alongside students racing across Australia in a solar car engineering competition.”\nIn addition to the presenting sponsor for the Dream Big project, Bechtel Corporation, additional sponsorships include S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation, ASCE, United Engineering Foundation, National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, Chevron, ASCE Foundation and SunTrust Bank.\nThe film is set to premiere in February 2017 during Engineers Week in science centers and museums nationwide and many countries around the world.\nDream Big is a giant-screen film and outreach program designed to transform the public’s understanding of engineering and excite and inspire a new generation of children to see engineering in a whole new way. The film brings to life the world’s greatest engineering marvels in 3D technology on movie screens six stories high.\nMacGillivray Freeman Films is the world’s foremost independent producer and distributor of giant-screen 70mm films with 38 films for IMAX and giant-screen theatres to its credit. Throughout the company’s 50-year history, its films have won numerous international awards including two Academy Award nominations and three films inducted into the IMAX Hall of Fame. The company’s film To Fly! is the longest-running IMAX movie ever produced.\nFounded in 1852, the American Society of Civil Engineers represents more than 146,000 civil engineers worldwide and is America’s oldest national engineering society.
