Dumaplin\nOctober 11, 2015 Arnel Pineda\nIf only to disprove rumors that he is no longer with Journey, singer Arnel Pineda is bent on bringing the band to the Philippines anew for a concert.\nThe last time the American band performed on local shores was in 2009.\n“I just want everybody to know that I’m alive and kicking with the band…na hindi ako natanggal sa banda,” Pineda told Push.\nHe’s been with Journey for eight years now and has never stopped touring with them, he added. In fact, they are planning to hold a world tour in the next two years. Well, unless “mag-disband” though Arnel quickly added there are “no plans” for them to part ways anytime soon, if at all.\nStill, the 48-year-old Pineda admitted he’s always been prepared for whatever the future holds, with or without the band. Even at this point, he’s already happy with the times he’s spent fronting for Journey.\n“Actually, para sa akin, maka-one year lang ako sa kanila – malibot ko lang ang buong Amerika touring with them – ay okay na sa akin… kahit nga isa or dalawang shows na nakasama ko sila (okay na ’ko dun eh),” he recalled telling himself when he got the job.\nAt 500 shows with Journey and counting, Arnel has exceeded the quota handsomely.\n“I’m still here. They still keep me and it’s such a blessing.”\nNo complaints\nDue to holding so many shows, Pineda, in the same Push report, revealed almost telling his wife, “Parang ayoko na ata ito, sobra na yata.” But he carried on.\nLike many renowned musical acts on tour, Pineda hardly sees much of the countries they visit.\n“Minsan nakakapunta ka sa magagandang lugar pero ang nakikita mo lang (’yung lugar ’pag) galing sa airport, na parang ‘Ay, ito pala ’yung Paris!’ Tapos wala na, parang nadaanan mo lang. Tapos ’pag gising mo, the next day mag-show ka, tapos alis ka na papunta sa next country, ganu’n,” he said.\nNot that he is complaining. Arnel stressed he’s always been thankful and proud to be part of Journey.\n“This is something na hindi mo tine-take for granted kasi napakalaking blessing nito sa pamilya ko,” Pineda said. “And many Filipinos are proud kung ano ’yung nagawa ko with the band.”\nJourney is known for the songs “Open Arms,” “Faithfully,” and “Don’t Stop Believin’,” among others.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:52:09.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
