It's a two-way street. It had happened to me. \n''When we started there was someone that we worked with that was inappropriately touching us. I was even aware then, at 16, that this guy was a pedophile and he was touching me oddly, but I didn't feel victimised at the time because I was very aware of it.'' \nWhile the 'Girlfriend' hitmaker never told anyone outside the boy band, who split in 2002, he admitted ''the guys would talk about it'' together, but didn't say whether they were subjected to the same treatment. \nHe added: ''We would kind of joke about it, but it's not a joking thing, but as a kid, it was just odd. I am glad that we were aware of it and we didn't feel victimised at the time.''
