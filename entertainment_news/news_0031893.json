Each scene has its own mood, its own feel, and the challenge for us as actors is that we only have about 30 minutes of dialogue to create that mood, create characters, and bring each situation to an entertaining, possibly thought-provoking, and hopefully satisfying conclusion.”\n“The whole show is about relationships in trouble, in every way imaginable, and how adults find a way to work through the troubles and carry on or save face,” added Matt Lindsay, who portrays William Warren (“Visitor from New York”) and Sidney Nichols. “There are plenty of laughs, but also a fair amount to think about.”\nLindsay portrayed Charlie Chaplin three months ago in the Dayton Playhouse FutureFest-winning production of “The Consul, The Tramp and America’s Sweetheart.” He shares his scenes in “California Suite” with Debra Strauss who portrayed Mary Pickford in the play. He admits they joked about having material that didn’t feel as comical as the other characters, but they have learned to find the humor.\n“Our scenes are about heavy stuff – divorcees arguing over custody of a daughter, a couple in a shell of a marriage – but there is still a fair share of funny in the scenes,” Lindsay said. “There’s some brilliant Neil Simon writing in these scenes. I am really enjoying working with Debra again after FutureFest. We got to start this process with a good rapport already established, and have been sharing good feedback as we develop the scenes and the characters.”\nThe cast, under the direction of Mike Rousculp, includes Strauss as Hannah Warren in addition to Angie Thacker as Millie Michaels and Madeline Swanson as Bunny (“Visitor from Philadelphia”), and Bishop as Mort Hollender, Amy Taint as Beth Hollender, Jamie McQuinn as Stu Franklyn, and Nancy Albert as Gert Franklyn (“Visitors from Chicago”).\n“Even the heaviest scenes are filled with laughs and the type of intelligent comic wit you wish you could come up with in everyday life,” Bishop said. “With four different scenarios and four different sets of characters I know the audience will be able to find something or someone they recognize (in order to) connect.”\nSimon received an Academy Award nomination for his 1978 film adaptation of the play. Maggie Smith notably received her second Academy Award as Diana. Smith is the only Oscar recipient to win the award for playing an Oscar loser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:36:07.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
