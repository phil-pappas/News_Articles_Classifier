Joakim Noah and Nikola Mirotic rounded out the lineup. The Bulls have used three in six games.\nGasol and Noah have played together in only one exhibition, Wednesday's loss to the Pistons. The jumbo lineup featuring Mirotic at small forward played so poorly that Hoiberg ditched it after halftime and shifted Mirotic to power forward and Noah to the bench.\nNoah played an active game at center Monday, finishing with 12 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.\nThe Tribune previously reported Hoiberg had internal discussions about starting Mirotic at power forward as far back as August. That was before Mike Dunleavy underwent back surgery that will sideline him well into November.\nSo it's conceivable Noah could hang on to a starting role with Mirotic at small forward until Dunleavy returns, although the one-game look didn't offer much positive proof.\nGasol, Butler and Derrick Rose — whenever he returns from his fractured left orbital bone — are locks to start. Given his team-oriented efficiency at both ends, it would be a surprise if Dunleavy doesn't start when he's healthy, and Hoiberg has committed to Doug McDermott in a reserve scoring role.\nThat leaves the power forward slot. Mirotic is the better shooter, a premium for the offense Hoiberg wants to run. Noah is the better defender and rebounder, though his defensive strengths have been limited some playing alongside Gasol.\nNoah is typically a team-first player who talks consistently about winning titles as his only goal. But moving to a reserve role, particularly in a contract year, would certainly test that resolve if Hoiberg opts for that route.\n\"Coach is going to have a lot of decisions to make in terms of matchups and things like that,\" Noah said recently. \"Whatever Coach does, I'm cool with it.\"\nOne of Steve Kerr's first moves as Warriors coach was moving former All-Star Andre Iguodala to a reserve role. Iguodala didn't love the demotion but respected Kerr's process. He embraced the role, played roughly the same number of minutes as Harrison Barnes and wound up being named NBA Finals MVP as the Warriors won the title.\nBarring injuries, Hoiberg will need a similar buy-in from some players. If it's Noah — who says he's fully healthy after last season's difficulties and is one season removed from first-team All-NBA and Defensive Player of the Year status — that will be an intriguing storyline to follow.\nIt could also lead to Hoiberg offering up another of his consistent phrases: It's not who starts games, it's who finishes.\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Fred Hoiberg Joakim Noah Nikola Mirotic Chicago Bulls Mike Dunleavy Golden State Warriors Jimmy Butler", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625a4db/turbine/ct-bulls-starters-rotation-spt-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:28:59.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
