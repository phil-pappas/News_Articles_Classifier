It's just a matter of time and we are getting there, like all the corporates from there are coming here.\n“So the gap has reduced. Our actors are working there and there are going to be collaborations. They've started recognising our films and our talent.”\nAjay, who has been part of the entertainment industry for over two decades, was felicitated at the summit on Monday for his contribution to Indian cinema.\nAsked whether he plans to make his Hollywood debut, Ajay said: “It depends on the project and its script. I have been offered a couple of things which I was not much interested in. But if something fabulous comes my way then why not.”\nApart from Ajay, the two-day summit also felicitated veteran actress Sharmila Tagore on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:32.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
