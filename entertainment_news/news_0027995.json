It was a historic day as American Pharoah became just the twelfth horse in the history of the sport to win the vaunted Triple Crown. His victories at the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes captivated the American public during the spring and the decision to continue his racing during the summer and fall months has led to historic ticket prices on the secondary market.According to Doug Dearen, founder of thoroughbred racing travel and tour company DerbyBox.com , ticket demand for this year’s Breeder’s Cup is at an all-time high. Taking place on October 30th and 31st in Lexington, Kentucky, 2015 Breeder's Cup tickets have been selling quicker this year than at any previous time, despite record prices. The cheapest two day pass still available starts at $1,150, with an average ticket price of $1,795 – more than three times expensive than last year’s average price of $493.Meanwhile, the cheapest grandstand seat for Saturday’s races (when American Pharoah will be competing) is $500. In 2014, tickets in the grandstand were available for as little as $35, less than one tenth of the cost this year. The average ticket price for Saturday is $1,302, compared to just $356 last year.With the expected attendance to be a record high, the site of the race, Keeneland, is adding temporary seating to accommodate the masses. Nonetheless, some of the temporary seating will be without actual track views. There are less than 10,000 actual permanent seats at Keeneland, compared to over 50,000 at Churchill Downs and Santa Anita, so there will be a lot of attendees in a smaller space. According to Dearen, there is limited availability for actual reserved seats with a track view in the Grandstand Reserved, Clubhouse Reserved, and Grandstand Loge Box seats , though inventory is moving quickly.[caption id=\"attachment_482792350\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] MONMOUTH, NJ - AUGUST 2: Victor Espinoza rides atop American Pharoah #4 reacts after winning the 48th William Hill Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on August 2, 2015 in Monmouth, New Jersey.

With the Kentucky football team hosting SEC rival Tennessee, there will be thousands of cars hitting the road in the greater-Lexington area. As a result, many people have planned to spend the night near Keeneland. According to DerbyBox, a four night hotel package (that includes a ticket to the race) starts at $1,995.Though ticket and hotel prices are high, this year’s Breeder’s Cup is looking like it will be one of the most exciting in recent memory. For starters, it will be the first time ever that a horse in the field boasts a Triple Crown victory on his resume. American Pharoah cruised through the competition earlier in the year, and continued his winning ways at the Haskell Invitational in August. However, a month later at the Travers Stakes at Saratoga, Keen Ice slipped by American Pharoah to take home the victory. It was the first defeat for American Pharoah this year and opened the door for the possibility that another horse could win at the Breeder’s Cup.That horse could be the Philly Beholder who has won Grade 1 stakes events as a two, three, four, and five year old. She recently took home the Zenyatta Stakes, making her eligible to race in the Breeder’s Cup Classic against American Pharoah. No decision has been made yet, but it’s possible this year’s Breeder’s Cup Classic could be a historic duel.While the Breeder’s Cup may be one of the final times to see American Pharoah compete, his impact on the sport will continue. 2016 Kentucky Derby tickets and packages have already begun to sell at drastically higher prices compared to last year. The interest in the sport has certainly increased with the 2015 Triple Crown victory and it looks like it will carry over into future years.", "external_links": ["http://www.derbybox.com/Breeders-Cup-Tickets.htm", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/482792350/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.derbybox.com/Kentucky-Derby-Tickets.htm", "http://www.derbybox.com/Breeders-Cup-Packages.htm"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:41:27.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
