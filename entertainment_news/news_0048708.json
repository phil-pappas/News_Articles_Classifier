The early morning shows were cancelled over some payment issues in the wake of the I-T raids, industry insiders said, but backroom parleys were held to successfully break the deadlock even as irate fans protested cancellation of shows.\nRead: Income tax department raid houses of Tamil actors Vijay and Nayanthara\n\"Puli\" (Tiger) stars Vijay, Shruti Haasan, Motwani and Sridevi, among others and is directed by Simbudevan, who has churned out hits like \"Imsai Arasan Irubathi moondram Pulikesi\". Earlier, the I-T department had conducted raids at the premises of Vijay and the producers of the film. Incidentally, release time issues have become routine for Vijay, starting with \"Thuppaki\", when Muslim groups had objected to the portrayal of their community in the action thriller.\n​ Later \"Thalaiva\" faced roadblocks with a small outfit raising objections even as his next venture \"Kaththi\" faced opposition from pro-Sri Lankan Tamil outfits who were against the producers of the movie, claiming they were close to the then Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Two theatres screening the movie were also attacked by some fringe outfits.\nA Madurai report said the film was released in southern districts after the morning show was cancelled.\nFans who had gathered in large numbers for the morning shows were irked at the cancellation of the screening and pelted stones at two buses here, damaging windscreens, police said.\nHowever the situation returned to normal after shows were screened later, they said.\nAll issues sorted ...
