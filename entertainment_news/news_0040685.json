When the show returns Sunday on AMC, they’ll see dozens of new zombies. But where do they come from? The actors who play them, that is. \n“I think we end up auditioning about 150 to 200 people per season and of that we have 25 or 30 that are superstars,” executive producer Greg Nicotero said during a behind-the-scenes look at the series on Friday’s Good Morning America . \nThe sixth season of the hit series was filmed during Atlanta’s brutally hot summer. Lauren Cohan, who plays Maggie Greene on the series, said the heat is essential: “It’s a character in the show, you know? When you don’t feel that sort of oppressive heat character you actually miss it.” \nWith so many viewers, the stars of the series have become household names — such as actress Danai Gurira, who portrays the sword-wielding Michonne. “Stepping up into her has been really awesome and exciting to do and challenged me beyond what I thought I could do,” Guiria said of the role. \nThe Walking Dead returns Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on AMC. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
