Pie is amazing.\nI'm afraid to make a pie from scratch. A homemade crust takes the right mix of ingredients, treated and handled just so, then combined with a balance of filling and flavors.\nTo break out of my cake-and-cookie comfort zone, I decided to get tips from Lehigh Valley experts on making an apple pie. It's the perfect time of year to make a pie, as apples are in season and available at farm stands and farmers markets throughout the Valley.\nRecipes to make a great apple pie Jennifer Sheehan Here's a basic apple pie recipe from Kelly Stem, pastry chef with the Culinary Arts Department at Northampton Community College:\nAPPLE PIE\n•Dough:\n12 ozs. flour\n1 tsp. salt\n8 ozs. butter or shortening\n4 ozs. ice-cold water\n•Filling:\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/4 cup flour\n1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon\n1/8 tsp....\nHere's a basic apple pie recipe from Kelly Stem, pastry chef with the Culinary Arts Department at Northampton Community College:\nAPPLE PIE\n•Dough:\n12 ozs. flour\n1 tsp. salt\n8 ozs. butter or shortening\n4 ozs. ice-cold water\n•Filling:\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/4 cup flour\n1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon\n1/8 tsp....\n(Jennifer Sheehan) Offering their guidance are three amazing Valley bakers: Kelly Stem, pastry chef with the Culinary Arts Department at Northampton Community College; Mary Grube, cooking instructor with Northampton Community College's adult enrichment program; and Aubrey Keenan, who won a blue ribbon at the \"My Favorite Apple Pie\" contest at Burnside Plantation's Apple Days last month.\nThe crux of a good crust\nLike the foundation of a house, the crust is the all-important basis for a good pie.\nIt must be the perfect texture — flaky and light but sturdy enough to support all the deliciousness that will be baked inside.\n\"Crust, crust, crust,\" Grube says. \"That is the single most intimidating thing about pie for people.\"\nWithout mastering the crust, it won't matter what you put inside.\nKeenan, like me, is fairly new to making pies from scratch. Her winning apple pie was, incredibly, her first time baking a pie with a from-scratch crust.\n\"I did a lot of research for the crust,\" says Keenan, of Hanover Township, Northampton County. \"Before I would have just used a store-bought crust.\"\nPie crust is made with simple ingredients such as water, flour, salt and some kind of fat. There are different schools of thought on what fat is best.\nSome, like Grube, are devotees of butter.\n\"A butter crust is flaky and has a firm crumb in your mouth,\" Grube says. \"Crisco doesn't have that same texture.\"\nStem prefers to use lard, if it's available, or Crisco.\n\"Crisco is a little easier to work with,\" Stem says.\nAside from those basic crust ingredients, bakers will often add a dash of this or that. Keenan added a bit of white vinegar to her mix, which she says helped produce a flaky crust. Grube uses a little sugar in her pie crust.\nWhere people often get into trouble with their pie crusts is overworking the dough. You should basically mix to combine. You want the butter or Crisco in the dough to resemble meal.\n\"Most people over-work the crust,\" Stem says. \"If you over-work it, it won't roll out. It won't bake. Nothing about it will be right.\"\nAnother goof people make is not keeping all of their crust ingredients cold, especially the water and the butter or Crisco. This is where baking is like chemistry: If the butter or other fat is super cold, bits of it will remained unmelted longer between the layers of flour and melt away with the baking, producing flaky layers. If the fat is too warm, it will absorb the flour too quickly and you won't get those flaky layers.\nGrube advises you monitor how much water you put into your dough. Don't dump it all in at one time.\n\"Any time you bake, especially pastry or bread, it depends on the weather,\" Grube says. \"Always add less, then adjust.\"\nThe goal is to moisten, not soak.\nThen shape your dough into a disk (shape gently like you would a hamburger from ground beef), then chill in the fridge before rolling it out.\nGrube advises you use as little flour as possible when rolling out your dough. She rolls out her dough in between two sheets of parchment paper so she can cut down on how much flour she'll have to use.\nApples: Tart or sweet?\nNow that we have the solid building blocks for our apple pie, we can move on to what to put inside.\nApples, of course, but what kind?\nThere are hundreds of varieties of apples. At my recent stop at the Emmaus Farmers Market, I learned North Star Orchard grows more than 350 types, from tasty and tart to super sweet.\nEveryone has a favorite apple to use in pie and it's often rooted in family history.\nKeenan uses a mix of McIntosh and Granny Smith for a classic pie apple.\n\"My grandfather would bring apple pie to Thanksgiving,\" Keenan says. \"He always used McIntosh. Most recipes call for Granny Smith, but I always liked his pies.\"\nGrube prefers golden delicious in her pies because it's what her grandmother used. She has a handwritten recipe card from her grandmother that says \"for my Mary\" on it.\n\"She really perfected it,\" Grube says of her grandmother's apple pie. \"I was the apple pie kid. Apple pie has been a favorite all my life.\"\nStem says it's important to consider an apple's texture when choosing the right one for a pie.\n\"You want an apple that's softer in texture and a little on the sweeter side,\" Stem says.\nShe also goes with McIntosh and Granny Smith (her mom swears by pure McIntosh.) She has also used honeycrisps and liked the results.\n\"It's about the right sweetness,\" Stem says.\nFall spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg go well in an apple pie.\n\"Keep it simple,\" Stem advises.\nKeenan isn't wild about cinnamon so she stuck with brown sugar and butter with her apples.\nThe pie's the limit\nNow that you have your pie filled with delicious apple-ness, you have to decide if you want to stop or blanket your pie in more goodness.\nClassic apple pie often has a lattice top, but that's challenging for a newbie crust-maker. You don't have to cover the top of the pie at all. You can go with a crumb topping (flour, sugar, cinnamon, butter).\nIf you're feeling confident, go ahead and make crust for the top. Just leave vents to let the steam escape and brush it with some egg wash.\nKeep in mind, making a pie from scratch can be challenging and will take some practice.\nIt might not even be the best looking pie. But that's fine,\n\"It is very tricky,\" Stem says. \"It's something that take many tries.\"\njsheehan@mcall.com\ntwitter @jenwsheehan\n610-820-6628", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626c131/turbine/mc-recipes-apple-pie-cooking-class-2-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:59:16.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
