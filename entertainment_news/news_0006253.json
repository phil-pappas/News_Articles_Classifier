Alek Skarlatos Has Injured His Nose During Dancing with the Stars Rehearsal Tuesday, 13 October 2015 (23 minutes ago) Another injury has struck on Dancing with the Stars. Alek Skarlatos has suffered a nose injury just a few hours before Monday night's Switch-Up Week competition, when his partner Emma Slater accidentally elbowed him in the face during rehearsal. After being checked out by doctors it was determined that the show will go on with Skarlatos as planned. \"Alek will be performing in tonight's show and the official diagnosis is expected tomorrow,\" a spokesperson told People. Skarlatos' injury comes two weeks after Kim Zolciak suffered a mini stroke and was unable to compete, and therefore cut from the show. Bindi Irwin has also been dancing despite foot pain.
