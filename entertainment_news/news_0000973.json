He's ready now. \nThe 24-year-old revealed Thursday that he is gay in interviews with The Associated Press and ESPN The Magazine. He tells the AP he likes the idea of coming out while he's at the top of his game, when people in his sport - especially kids - are paying attention. \nHis initial plan was to come out by winning a medal at the 2014 Sochi Games and kissing his then boyfriend on the hill. But he hadn't told his family yet. He says that \"would've been an amazing way to come out,\" given the anti-gay legislature in place in Russia. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
