As seen in Wednesday's episode, the Lazarus Pit has already begun to have serious effects on Thea (Willa Holland), who was only briefly dead before her resurrection. [...] since Sara has been dead for months, that means the Pit's influence on her will be far worse, something she will continue to deal with when she joins the spin-off Legends of Tomorrow in 2016. It's kind of this paradox that she's selected for the team because she's this ruthless, cold-blooded assassin and what she really wants is to feel again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:51:52.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
