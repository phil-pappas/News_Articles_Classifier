Chinese Hanzi. [photograph] Retrieved from: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/chinese-hanzi.jpg Departing from Heidegger, the structuralists came to reject the idea that language could be founded upon consciousness. This is quite different from the Heideggerian notion that speech allows the world to be revealed to us in a specific and identifiable manner. Heidegger became preoccupied with the transformation and mutation of philosophically significant terms throughout the history of philosophy, and wanted to study how these words and t heir usages allowed people to experience and interpret the world in a specific way. \"We could refer to this aspect of Heideggerian phenomenology as \"etymologism,\" or the idea that abstractions may always be referred back to some originally active and intending consciousness. To assume, with phenomenology and hermeneutics, that structures are capable of interpretation is to assume that we are not merely located within sign systems,...we can always retrieve and intuit a system's original sense. While post-phenomenological philosophers...were to maintain an attention to the genesis of language...they complicated the project of genesis or emergence by recognizing another problem: the problem of structure.\"\nStructuralism initially began in linguistics, through the work of Saussure, and anthropology, through Levi-Strauss. It also became influential in psychoanalysis through the work of Jacques Lacan . Structuralists were reoccupied with the problem of presence. Could a sign or proposition be traced to consciousness or lived experience? No, the structuralists believed. The sign only functions in relation to other signs. It does not refer back to a self-present sense or object.\n\"If I use a word in a language that you do not understand and offer you an ostensive definition - I utter the word \"red\" and point to an apple - then you cannot know the meaning of the word - does it name the object \"apple\" or the color of that object or the object's shape, and so on? - or how it is properly used without further repetition.\"\nSch an individual, Colebrook notes , can then point to a wheelbarrow and utter \"red\" again and you would eventually begin to understand, through this repetition, what was the reference of the word. A speaker understands terms through differentiation and relation rather than self-presence. This repetition gives use to the fact that language is constituted as relations of difference. \"Language is thus differential in two senses; it works by producing distinctions among sounds...and differences among concepts.\" Thus, for the structuralists, philosophy should not be about a self-existent, autonomous act. The \"present\" always refers beyond itself to something other. For Lacan, language had the function of metonymy. It always implicitly referred to other signifiers, as Lacan would formulate it. He rejected Saussure's distinction between signifier and what the signifier signified, and instead, insisted that signifiers always only ever refer to other signifiers.\nRoland Barthes, for example, was preoccupied with cultural forms which presented something as natural or precultural. Everything, however, achieves its goal through cultural signs. As Colebrook puts it, \"Barthes argued that myth was a form of \"frozen\" speech that would take historically complex events and present them as timeless and natural. One example is a picture on the cover of Paris magazine Match, where a colonized black soldier salutes the flag. This seemingly innocent picture actually presents a series of assumptions, such as the joyous willingness of the colonized to respect authority, the flag as worthy of recognition, and the inclusion of colonized others in a world \"we\" all assume to be incontestable.\"\nBarthes was therefore critical of cultural symbols and objects that presented certain realities as timeless. Instead, they were arbitrary and historically contingent, and represented certain discourses and worldviews. Indeed, these cultural forms and artifacts refer back to entire systems of meaning which have conditioned us to perceive the world in a specific manner. This led Barthes to a radically anti-hermeneutical position beyond that of Heidegger. A text was no longer seen as having a definite meaning.\n\"Barthes...characterized two ways of approaching texts: the \"readerly\" approach assumes that texts have a single sense that can be intuited or interpreted and that the desire for understanding leads to the fulfillment of a final meaning. In contrast the \"writerly\" approach does not find a sense behind language but takes enjoyment in the play of language, no longer seeing consummation in some definitive meaning. Barthes''s \"The Pleasure of the Text argued for a radical commitment to the primacy of language that is intensely antihermenenutic: one approaches a text not to reduce the signs of language to some hidden and underlying meaning, but enjoys language as such and does so by happily abandoning any notion of a justification or fulfillment beyond the text.\"", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan", "http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/chinese-hanzi.jpg", "http://www.academia.edu/1186021/Linguistic_Turn"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:41:42.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
