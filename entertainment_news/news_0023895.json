With two heavyweights clashing, a tense battle was on the cards and more often than not, these contests end up being cagey battles with the game seldom opening up. Here, Rafael Benitez and Laurent Blanc adopted an attacking ethos throughout. While the buildup play and intensity was good, the end product was missing and even the chances that fell to both teams were more of half-chances than anything else. \nCristiano Ronaldo could have scored as early as the second minute of the game had he not tripped while darting into the danger area during an attack. Madrid saw a lot of the ball and pressed well to retrieve the ball in the centre of the pitch and the flanks. Casmeiro was a constant menace when Paris were on the ball and Madrid had several moments where their interplay and efficiency left their opponents flabbergasted. The half-time break helped Paris regroup and in the second half, created more goalmouth chances but the final ball was missing. Edinson Cavani nearly scored when a cross was floated in to the far post. Both Cavani and talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic had matches to forget while Paris’s backline, Maxwell and Serge Aurier in particular were excellent throughout the game and stemmed the flow of attacks from coming in. Ronaldo also had a quiet game and lacked support at several places. Third choice PSG goalie, Kevin Trapp was called into action throughout and passed the test with flying colours. \nManchester United got away with a point from Russia and lie third in the table. David de Gea mades made a couple of heart-stopping saves in the first half. Towards the end though, Seydou Doumbia put CSKA Moscow in the lead. United bounced back in the second half and it was Antonio Valencia’s pin point cross from the right that set up the goal. Anthony Martial at the neat post made a diving header to slot the ball into the far corner and the match finished 1-1. Louis van Gaal’s side still lie third in the table. It was a memorable night for Swedish side Malmo, who edged out Shakhtar Donestsk 1-0 through veteran striker Marcus Rosenberg’s strike. \nAtletico Madrid romped to a landslide 4-0 win over modest Astana while Manchester City breathed a huge sigh of relief after their earlier loss to Juventus at home. Opponents Sevilla had taken the lead through Yevhen Konoplyanka. It looked like City was going to have another gloomy European night. However, they came back strongly in the early stages of the second half and got and equaliser through an Adil Rami own goal. It was summer signing Kevin de Bruyne who ensured all three points for City as the Belgian went on a surging run on the right, cut in and shot on goal. The ball was in the net and Manuel Pellegrini’s side had clinched it in stoppage time. \n  3:15 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:53:05.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
