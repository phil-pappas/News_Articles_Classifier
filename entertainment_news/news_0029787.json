Alison Mosshart 's vocals marinate in more reverb than early Elvis, and Jack White 's murder tale \"Three Dollar Hat\" sounds like an 80-year-old track from Harry Smith 's folk anthology, minus the gramophone crackle.\nIn this case, retro rocks. White produced, and his typically sparse arrangements give each note that much more punch, while his drumming provides plenty of propulsion.\nMosshart sings about negative feedback, grinding her teeth and going back to bed. She dials down her delivery with lovely singing on the closing ballad \"Impossible Winner,\" a testament to staying power. Its potential sports arena fodder, an odd prospect for a band that does best when it has the blues.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/44/8833306/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/44/8833306/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:31:09.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
