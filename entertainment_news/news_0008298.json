If there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, I go to someone's management, I get their number and I text them. It's an important lesson for anyone to learn in 2015.\"Swift was happier to talk about her friendship with Kanye, who famously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV VMAs.\"Me and Kanye are on such good terms now, six years later,\" said Swift. \"It took a while... But I had to tell Beck this story earlier.\"I was at dinner with Kanye a week after the Grammys, he stops what he's saying and he goes, 'What is this song? I need to listen to this every day'. © NME / Jordan Hughes \"I said, 'It's Beck, it's on an album called Morning Phase, I think you've heard of it…' We just burst out laughing. And he says, 'Hey, sometimes I'm wrong'.\"Kanye had of course protested Beck winning the Grammy Award for Best Album for Morning Phase, initially joke-rushing the stage and later saying that the singer-songwriter should have \"respected artistry\" and given his prize to Beyoncé. The rapper later gave Beck a public apology.Beck had taken Kanye's interruption in good humour at the time, saying: \"You can't please everybody, man.\"I still love him and think he's genius. I aspire to do what he does.\" © NME / Jordan Hughes Asked if the thought of topping her 1989 album scares her, Swift said: \"N . How could the next one be as big?\"Maybe the next album will be a bridge to somewhere else. Or maybe I'll just go ahead and change everything.\" She added of her plans after her world tour ends in December: \"I think I should take some time off. I think people might need a break from me.\"I'm going to... I don't know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\" To read the full interview, pick up your free copy of NME magazine tomorrow (October 9).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:59:45.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
