We're expecting tries, and plenty of them.\n2.00pm: Pool D: Italy v Romania\nKick-Off: 2.30pm\nStadium: Sandy Park\nThese two sides have nothing to play for apart from pride, and a third place finish, which is all they can hope for having failed to pick up a scalp against the groups two bigger sides, Ireland and France. Judging from both sides attacking play so far in the tournament we might not see champagne football, but we've seen enough of them to know they'll be giving it their all.\n4.30pm: Pool D: Ireland v France\nKick-Off: 4.45pm\nStadium: Millennium Stadium\nThe big one. The one we've all been waiting for. We're not going to jinx it by predicting a result, actually, we won't talk about anything just in case, we're superstitious like that. What we will say is we couldn't care about the performance, we just want to pick up the W and move on to a quarter-final with Argentina. Lets not talk about what'll happen is we lose.
