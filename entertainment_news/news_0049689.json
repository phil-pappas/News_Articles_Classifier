(AP)\nHayden Panettiere is entering treatment for postpartum depression.\nA spokeswoman for the actress says in a statement that the \"Nashville\" star is voluntarily seeking professional help at a treatment center while battling postpartum depression. She asked that the media respect her privacy during this time.\nPanettiere gave birth to her daughter in December. It's the first child for the 26-year-old actress and 39-year-old professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko.\nThe new mom opened up about her struggle on \"Live with Kelly and Michael\" in September.\n\"When [you’re told] about postpartum depression you think it’s ‘I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child,' I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. But you don't realize how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on...It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they’re not alone, and that it does heal.\"\nNotably, Panettiere's character on \"Nashville,\" Juliette Barnes, has experienced postpartum depression.\nThe actress also starred in the NBC series \"Heroes\" and the film \"Scream 4.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/Scitech/People-Hayden"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:29:39.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
