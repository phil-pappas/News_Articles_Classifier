Strongly influenced by humanism, Rubens’ original work is an interpretation of Titian’s iconic painting The Worship of Venus.\nSo far, Krymskaya has completed over 80 variations of the painting herself after developing a fascination for the painting and its universal theme of love, spirituality and the remaking of artworks.\nSpeaking of what she wants to see from submissions she said. “I was so inspired by Rubens’ rework that I thought it would be a great idea to continue his legacy through artists’ reinterpretations of his masterpiece. I’d like artists to have complete creative freedom when approaching their variation; they can use any materials or mediums, to provoke, criticize and to push the limits as much as they want”.\nWith 3045 Variations on The Feast of Venus, Inga explores the different possibilities conceivable on one theme, using various mediums to expand Rubens’ painting and give another conceptual interpretation each time.\nThe deadline for artist submissions is Friday 26th February 2016 and all entries or queries should be made to info(at)curzonpr(dot)com.\nNotes to Editors:\nInga Krymskaya is a Russian-born contemporary visual artist. Her latest work, 3045 Variations on The Feast of Venus explores the different possibilities conceivable on one theme, using various mediums to expand Rubens’ painting and give another conceptual interpretation each time. Inga’s endeavour is to make The Feast of Venus a global collaborative project with other artists, continuing Rubens’ legacy.\nInga’s work has been exhibited at several art fairs and galleries across the world, including G-77 Gallery in Kyoto, VK Gallery in Amsterdam, Wall Gallery in Amsterdam, Arttitud San Francisco, Berliner Liste (Germany), SCOPE (New York, Basel), and the Antwerp EXPO.
