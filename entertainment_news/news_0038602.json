Using milk in the grits has made them very creamy, and Gouda adds lots of flavor, but using chicken or shrimp stock instead of water would have increased the flavor even more. Kale chips are trendy and add a punch of color to this impressive looking plate.\nJennifer Plonka: This cook used an exciting and unique flavor combination of Gouda and chocolate. Who would have thought? This is a creative and modern twist on a recipe that looks like one found in an upscale restaurant. It's a bit disappointing that the recipe looks like it was thrown together hastily and has a wide range of ingredient amounts. The recipe could be improved considerably with some minor tweaking.\nDonna Johnson: The wine sauce has a subtle chocolate taste with layered flavors and a little bit of heat. I liked the use of red wine, oyster sauce and chili peppers, as chocolate can be a strong flavor. These all enhanced the flavor of the shrimp. However, I felt that it needed a little more zip. The grits are flavorful, especially with the addition of Gouda cheese.\nRum Glazed Shrimp and Grilled Grits with Kale -- Marie Bass\nPK: The crispy/creamy grilled grits with garlic and cheese are a delicious twist on tradition, but instead of adding only water, try adding some chicken stock next time for more flavor. I wish the shrimp had been tossed in a little of the sauce prior to plating, as it appears to be a cross between a barbecue and sweet-sour sauce and sounds wonderful with the shrimp. Kale chips add nice color to the already pretty dish.\nJP: This recipe is well-written and easy to follow. Grilling the grits gives a great smokiness to the final product that complements the chocolate and rum well. Crispy kale creates a tremendous texture combination with the creamy grits, and the glaze has a great depth of flavor with a balance of sweet and savory components. There was room for additional creativity, but overall this seems to be a pleasant dish.\nDJ: I love a colorful plate with strong flavors and this recipe delivered. The rum sauce has a nice, rich, smooth chocolate flavor that enhanced the taste of the shrimp. The sauce was wonderfully balanced and not too overpowering. Grilling the grits gave them a firmer texture, while the kale added the crispiness to balance out the dish.\nIn Challenge 10, Susie Mingee and Chelsea La Valle faced mackerel from King Oscar, arugula, lemon and chickpeas.\nHoly Mackerel Patties over Arugula with Lemon Sauce -- Susie Mingee\nJoanna Miller: You had me at arugula and lemon sauce, two of my favorites. I couldn't wait to review the rest of the recipe. I am excited by the combination of ingredients, a mixture of healthy and delicious. This recipe is not overloaded with a long list of ingredients/steps. I appreciate that, as I am always looking for healthy, quick and tasty dishes for my family. The lemon juice will really highlight the various ingredients and really bring out the layers of flavor. Chickpeas can be so versatile. I like the approach of incorporating them into the mackerel.\nMichael Pennisi: When I read the ingredients, my first thoughts were of a similar presentation. Using chickpeas as a binder for the fish cakes is a good way to merge the mystery ingredients. The lemon sauce is a zesty spin on tartar sauce for dressing the fish cakes, and the capers are an excellent inclusion to balance out the creamy, tangy sauce. Sadly, the plain bed of arugula diminishes the overall dish.\nJohn Engle: I adore seafood croquettes. This is a very simple recipe. The combination of mackerel, onions, peppers, parmesan cheese and seasoned bread crumbs makes me want to belly-up to the bar. Something slightly more complex would have made the difference. Perhaps the patties could have been formed around some tasty cheese that melted inside the croquette or plated with chips to go with that fish topped with lemon sauce.\nFettuccine Arugula Pesto with Polpettini and Bruschetta -- Chelsea La Valle\nJM: This Italian-based recipe covers all the bases, from the ingredients to flavor. I see this as a meal that may appeal to sophisticated palates. I appreciate the creativity of taking traditional Italian dishes and adding a spin to them with the arugula pesto and bruschetta with chickpeas. I would like if this recipe had reduced steps, as this, for me, is a meal to make on weekends for a dinner party rather than a daily family meal.\nMP: Using arugula to make pesto is a fabulous idea that more cooks should try. The steps and ingredients provided in the recipe show a strong command of technique. This cook also used chickpeas as a binding agent with the mackerel in the meatballs, and while I'm quite impressed with the method, I'm a little skeptical of the taste of the finished meatball paired with the pesto sauce. With a good crusty bread, the bruschetta side dish will be delicious.\nJE: I had to Google \"polpettini!\" This recipe is sophisticated and might intimidate a novice chef in the kitchen. But I couldn't resist the meatballs on pasta, and all those flavors of oregano, onions, garlic, red peppers and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Top that off with arugula pesto and bruschetta and I am going to head home early for dinner. This recipe would have been a runaway winner had it been called Mackerel Polpettini.
