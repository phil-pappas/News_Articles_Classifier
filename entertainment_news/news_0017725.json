Fassbender does something in this movie where we're at the end of the scene, and he asked me not to call cut. And when the scene was over, he continued and did something that made me cry in the tent. I've never done that before.\n\"The head of my company, Jason Taylor, grabbed a Kleenex.\nSimon Kinberg, the writer who has no emotions at all, actually became emotional,\" the director said.\nCalling it \"beautiful\" the Jack the Giant Slayer actor said the Steve Jobs star took the whole scene to some other level.\n\"It was so beautiful. I've never seen an actor do this for me, and he just took the scene to a whole another level.\nIt's a heartbreaking scene, not a typical comic book movie scene at all, so let's hope it makes the cut,\" he said.\nX-Men Apocalypse is scheduled for May 27 release.\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Hollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Steve Jobs Official Trailer #2 (2015) Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogen Biography Movie HD\nX Men - Days Of Future Past/ X Men First Class Amazon.in : INR 699.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "http://www.amazon.in/Men-Days-Future-First-Class/dp/B00PIBBOHE%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00PIBBOHE", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZiS--zMfL._SL160_.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6UAT0lsjMI", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:09:16.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
