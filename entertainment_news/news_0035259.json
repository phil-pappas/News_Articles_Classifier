Photo: Supplied \nAs the centenary years of the First World War roll on, Australians have been told countless stories of mateship, sacrifice, and the burdens of those left behind.\nBut few stories have been shared about veterans from more recent conflicts, and how they have adjusted to civilian life after losing mates on the battlefields of Afghanistan.\nLaunching his new book The Promise  at the Australian War Memorial on Tuesday, Jamie Zimmermann will help shift the national conversation back to the needs and experiences of Australian soldiers in the country's most recent conflicts.\nJamie Zimmerman has written about his experiences with the special forces in Afghanistan. Photo: Supplied \nThe book's title refers to a promise the former special forces soldier made in 2011, to look after best friend Sergeant Brett Wood's wife and financial affairs should the worst unfold.\nAdvertisement Two months later, a late-night call confirmed the need to fulfil that promise: Sergeant Wood had been killed in action during his third tour of Afghanistan.\nThe news devastated Zimmermann, who was already coping with combat fatigue and the hard adjustment to ordinary life after his own tours of Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nHe employed coping mechanisms such as planning, fitness and art, and began the \"cathartic process\" of writing his book.\n\"[Writing the book] is probably one of the toughest things I've done,\" Zimmermann said.\n\"I don't know if inspiration is the right word at the moment, but I just had a couple of rock-bottom moments, even when I was doing well in people's eyes. It's helped to get things on paper.\"\nApart from the need to withhold classified information from operations, Zimmermann's writing is forthright and brutally honest.\nHe doesn't shy away from his post-deployment estrangement from his wife, Anne-Marie, nor his deliberate isolation and denial of the problems he was facing.\nThe result is an insight into the mind of the modern Australian soldier and their attitude to the military, exploring the \"brotherhood\" of fellow soldiers, and the experiences of their families.\nZimmermann said he was sure other servicemen and women could relate to the story, but hoped young people would also be able to connect with the earlier chapters, in which he detailed his teenage troubles with school and family.\n\"I do a lot of work with young people and certainly there's scope in the book for them to relate to those early experiences,\" he said.\n\"My representation is true storytelling, and servicemen and women most certainly can relate it back to their own stories.\"\nZimmermann said the Australian War Memorial's decision to host the launch of his book was \"humbling\", especially during the Centenary of Anzac commemorations.\n\"The centenary [timing] is just a coincidence, but I definitely know Brett was inspired to be a better soldier by his visit to Anzac Cove; the legacy was true to him,\" he said.\n\"I'm very grateful to be given the opportunity to hold the launch at the memorial. It's a good position from which to show the themes of the book.\"\nAs well as honouring Sergeant Wood's memory through the book, Zimmermann established the Australian Hero Games in 2011.\nThe online fitness challenge, which names each of its events after an Australian soldier killed in action, raises money for Soldier On, a charity for Australian servicemen and women who have been wounded either physically or psychologically.\nThe Promise , written by Jamie Zimmermann and published by Pan Macmillan Australia, will be released on October 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:06:46.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
