He uses the dog as a creative starting point and each piece of work is suggestive of the human. About 90% of the works borrow from the dog to explore various human behaviors. Most people generally feel kindness toward dogs because of their ability to soothe. Therefore, Huang's goal is to use the dog as a creative theme to convey positive traits such as self-confidence, courage, loyalty or innocence, and to provoke emotions and deeper thoughts.\n\"It is an honor to bring the works of this acclaimed and talented artist to New York,\" Yuko Nii, Founder & Artistic Director of the WAH Center states. \"Poren Huang's contemporary collection magnifies the strength of New York's art community by giving voice to other contemporary sculptors working in our community today,\" she adds.\nThe exhibition will be on display from November 7 through December 6, 2015.\nPlease visit www.thedogsnotes.splashthat.com to RSVP for the Opening Reception on November 7 from 4-6pm at the WAH Center. The reception is presented by Taiwan's Powen Gallery and organized by EVENTLAND and Spector Communications.\nAbout Poren Huang\nTaiwanese sculptor Poren Huang was born in Taichung County, located in central Taiwan. In his youth, he majored in sculpture at Fu-Hsin Trade & Art School.
