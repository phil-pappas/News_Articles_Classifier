The Australian-born actor has played the role for a long time already but time moves on, and so does Jackman, who will be playing the metal-clawed mutant for the last time. \nAccording to The Indian Express, \"Wolverine 3\" will be Jackman's final take of the franchise. That is why reports have been saying that he has been very particular about how the movie will run. Jackman said that he will not start shooting the third film until the script is perfected and is up to his high standards. \n\"I'm sounding a little cagey because this is the last time I'm playing him,\" said Jackman in an interview with Collider . \"And I have just made the commitment to myself, really, and told everyone that until that script is perfect, until it is that perfect way to sign out. I'm not gonna start shooting.\" \nBut as stated in Slash Film , fans need not to worry as the script is about 90 percent where Jackman wants it to be. In fact, they are planning to start shooting already by 2016 and they are already making the necessary preparations. \nJackman has not let go of the film yet but he is already eyeing someone who will be fit to replace him as Wolverine in future \"X-Men\" projects. According to Yibada, the 46-year old actor picks Tom Hardy as his successor. Considering Hardy's epic and successful performances in films like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" he will be a suitable replacement to play as Logan. \nJoining Jackman in the third installment of the \"Wolverine\" franchise is Patrick Stewart who will reprise his role as Professor Xavier. He will be playing an important role in the life of Logan as the story will try to explore the father-son relationship of the two, something that was never really seen before. \n\"Wolverine 3\" will be directed by James Mangold and is predicted to be released by March 3, 2017, assuming there are no delays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:25:44.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
