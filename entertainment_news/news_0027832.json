(Preorder paperback now for Christmas)\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) October 13, 2015\nBased on a true story, Eighth Wonder is a historical fiction tale that follows the lives of the talented, difficult, autistic slave boy, Thomas Bethune, and the enigmatic master who saved his life. The odd blind slave has a prodigious gift on the piano. Popularly known as Blind Tom, his fame becomes so great rumors swirl across the land that Abraham Lincoln plans to kidnap him for the abolitionist cause-a threat leading to his escape from America with his master, Colonel Bethune. Caught between the traditions of the South and the forces of change on both sides of the ocean-the Colonel and Thomas are in constant danger. Master and slave, desperately need one another for survival in a world bent on tearing them apart long after the War Between the States ends\nAward-winning writer/author A.M. Cal spins a rich historical fiction story of the musical slave, Thomas Bethune, known throughout the world as Blind Tom, in a debut historical novel, Eighth Wonder: The Thomas Bethune Story (372 pp, tpb, $21.99, thb, $24.99). This 19th century civil war epic of imagination and edge-of-your seat suspense is told through the eyes of the aristocratic master with the crumbling empire who saved Blind Tom's life, took him from his family, made him a son, and went on to rebuild his fortune. Cal is a professional t.v. writer/film producer and double doctoral student in Organizational and Global Leadership at Pepperdine University. Cal, a former journalist (L.A. Times, Greenwich Times) was part of the Image Award writing team for Best T.V. Comedy Tyler Perry's House of Payne, and recognized by the prestigious Nicholl’s Fellowship (Finding Forrester ) and Chesterfield Writers Film Project (Traffic, A Walk To Remember) as a semi-finalist for her original screenplay, Fathers of God.\nEarly Praise: Steinway artist and classical pianist, John Davis, performer of the best-selling Blind Tom CD of Thomas Bethune’s published works, says, “A.M. Cal's novel, Eighth Wonder, is a welcome addition to the mounting body of artistic works inspired by the improbable life and career of Thomas Wiggins, the 19th-century African American pianist/composer more popularly known as \"Blind Tom\"I found it absolutely riveting.”\nEighth Wonder is a biographical saga of love, deceit, and betrayal that follows the lives of the talented autistic slave boy and his enigmatic master. The odd blind slave is difficult, roams the plantation, and doesn't speak until one night Mozart spills through the house and becomes the answer to his master's financial woes. The mercurial boy's fame becomes so great rumors swirl across the land that Abraham Lincoln plans to kidnap him for the abolitionist cause-a threat leading to his escape from America with his master, Colonel Bethune. Caught between the traditions of the South and the forces of change championed by abolitionists, on both sides of the ocean-the Colonel and Thomas, master and slave, desperately need one another for survival in a world bent on tearing them apart long after the War Between the States ends.\nRecent Honor - Eighth Wonder is SELF-e Library Journal’s “Highlight of the Month” for libraries throughout the United States for the holiday season 2015.
