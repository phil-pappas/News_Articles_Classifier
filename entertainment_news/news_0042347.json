Scotland Yard's macabre Crime Museum goes on public display The anthropometric record card of Sarah Giles, a servant who was convicted of stealing in 1897, on display making up part of a mosaic of cards on a table top during a press preview for the Crime Museum Uncovered exhibition at the Museum of London in the City of London, Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015.
