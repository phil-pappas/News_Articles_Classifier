I fantasized that I could write a story using the wildlife and perhaps include an educational component for young children that could be used in a classroom setting. As I was writing and naming the birds and animals that were going to be used in the story, I also included a little boy, Joey, my son. As the story unfolds, Joey makes up the names of the wildlife and starts talking to them. A child’s imagination can run wild, as any parent would know!”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Joe Lando’s poignant tale is a splendid narrative for young readers. Lessons abound in this cheerful and inspired work, which is accompanied by beautiful illustrations created by Amy Siebers.\nTalking birds, otters, and an alligator! Little Joey discovers that his pond is the neatest place to be. Every day he sits on the shore of the pond near his home. He always talks to the wildlife in make-believe. One sunny day, they start talking back! Harry the Heron, Ollie the Otter, and Little Al the alligator. Certainly they aren’t actually talkingare they? The animals tell Joey about a problem concerning Little Al and ask him to solve it.\nThis story is developed to allow a child to learn problem-solving and science components skills.\nReaders who wish to experience this charming work can purchase “The Pond” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
