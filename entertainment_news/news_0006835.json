Thanks @GQMagazine for my first cover :) pic.twitter.com/lzCz5MbMHT \n— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) October 8, 2015 \nIn September last year, Taylor told Rolling Stone magazine that the song was about a fellow female pop star who tried to sabotage her tour. \n“She did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me,” she said. \nBut in the GQ interview, Taylor explained that her thought process behind the comment was to avoid the press thinking Bad Blood was about an ex-boyfriend. Thanks for the beach day, @GQMagazine ☀️ pic.twitter.com/o91BaiRQYp \n— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) October 16, 2015 \n“You’re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, ‘Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life’. Promoted stories \n“And you sit there, and you know you’re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don’t want him — or his family — to think you’re firing shots at him. So you say, ‘That was about losing a friend’.” \nThe rumours she was referring to Katy Perry were fanned by Katy’s own tweet shortly after the interview came out: “Watch out for the Regina George in sheep’s clothing,” referring to the Mean Girls character.

But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant.” \nTaylor said she can “sleep at night” knowing she never named a specific person. \n“I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labelled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship,” she said. Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing… \n— KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 9, 2014 \n“So I don’t necessarily care who people think it’s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target.” \nShe added that if you listen to the song: “It doesn’t point to any one person or any one situation.” \n“But if you’d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. \n“It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.” Kanye West and Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMA Awards (Jason DeCrow/AP) \nTaylor also told the magazine how bewildered and upset she had been when Kanye West stormed the stage at the 2009 MTV VMAs and said that Beyonce should have won best video instead of her. It was a huge moment for Taylor as she was the first country artist to win a VMA. \n“When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn’t deserve the award. That’s where the hurt came from,” she said. \n“I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn’t that big of a deal. \n“But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other — that’s one of my favourite things that has happened in my career.” The two hugged it out at this year’s VMAs (Matt Sayles/AP) \nTaylor is known for her close squad of female pals, but admitted that she enjoys being alone with her other Friends- the TV kind. \n“I’m around people so much. Massive amounts of people… So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I’ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a Friends marathon, I don’t feel lonely. Taylor and her #Squad (Jordan Strauss/Invision) Share article \n“I’ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That’s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people,” she said.
