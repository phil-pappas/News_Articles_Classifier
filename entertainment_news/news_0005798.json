The three-time Oscar winner is set to serve as a president of the jury panel at the upcoming 66th annual event scheduled to take place from February 11 to 21 in 2016. \"It will be the first time in her longstanding career that this world famous star takes on the role of a juror at a film festival,\" the organizers say. The actress won several prizes at the film festival in the past. In 2012, she received Golden Bear for lifetime achievement. \"Meryl Streep is one of the most creative and multifaceted film artists. To mark our enthusiasm for her extraordinary talent we awarded her the honorary Golden Bear in 2012 for her lifetime achievement. I am very happy that she is returning to Berlin and with her artistic experience will take on the chairmanship of the International Jury,\" says Berlinale director Dieter Kosslick. The actress herself states, \"It is a thrill to return to the festival under any circumstances, but it is with great relish and anticipation I look forward to jury duty. The responsibility is somewhat daunting, as I have never been president of anything before, and I hope I can come up to the precedent set by the distinguished juries of preceding years.
