During one of her breakdown periods, they met up and went on a mad bender. They went on holiday, got very drunk and ended up getting married. They both knew it was a mistake at the time.\"Asked why Cindy is secretly delaying the divorce, he replied: \"We don't really know at the moment. She didn't sign the annulment papers after he turned up asking for a divorce earlier this year.\"Mac's a wealthy man and his family get whatever they want, so there may be something else Cindy is after. There's also a massive secret regarding Cindy and Mac set to be revealed.\" © Lime PicturesWhat is Cindy up to?
