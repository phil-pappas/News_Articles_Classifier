Henson) is overseeing a photo shoot for her star singer Tiana (Serayah). When Hakeem shows up and he asks Mama Lyon if she thinks someone killed Vernon. \"Where we from if snitches don't kill themselves, somebody else will.\" Cookie might be a fortune teller, too.\nThe Collaboration\nJamal is teaming up with R&B hitmaker Ne-Yo, who plans on coming on Jamal's tour. When Jamal's boyfriend Michael (Rafael de la Fuente) shows up at the studio and reveals he'll be joining them on the road, Lucious tells his son not to \"bring your girlfriend\" on tour \"because you need to focus.\" As J' says, is dad really the one to be dishing out relationship advice?\nMatt Dinerstein/FOX Guest star Charles Malik Whitfield (l.) and Trai Byers in Wednesday's episode of \"Empire.\" Dear God\nAndre meets with the reverend to chat about his upcoming baptism. Dre is still struggling with the fact that he helped bury and then dig up poor Vernon. Of course the reverend doesn't know about Vernon, but tells Dre anyway that \"you're house ain't clean, if your closets are dirty.\" There is more than just dirt and skeletons in the Lyons' closets.\nSneak attack\nTiana is waiting for a ride in front of Lyon Dynasty's studio when she gets attacked by two girls who pose as fans. They steal her bag and post a video on YouTube to try to extort money from Cookie.\nThe betrayal\nThe sleazy photog, who painted a portrait of Jamal, meets him and Michael for a drink. He later comes on to Jamal and is turned down. \"Even if I was attracted to you, I wouldn't do that to Michael.\" If only Michael applied the same rules: he later gets serviced by the slimeball outside of the apartment he shares with Jamal.\nProtection\nCookie hires a handsome promoter (Adam Rodriguez) who warns her that people on the street are watching her and \"counting her money.\" Her ex-assistant walks in begging for her job back and brings with her a watchdog \"Whoopty Woo.\" The furry pooch looks more like a family pet than a killer but Cookie tells Porsche she can come back on probationary terms.\nChuck Hodes/FOX Jussie Smollett (l.) and music guest star Ne-Yo in Fox's \"Empire\" season 2, episode 5. Ashes to ashes\nLucious and Cookie meet in a funeral home to pick up Vernon's ashes where she asks him if he killed Vernon. \"Everyone we know ended up in boxes, how will we keep our family safe?\" she says before telling her ex to \"prove that you're half human and take the damn ashes.\" But before she can blink, Lucious exits and leaves her with Vernon's remains.\nHave a drink\nLucious' lawyer Thirsty (Andre Royo) pours himself a drink in Lucious' office and confronts Dre.\nHey, here's a good idea, Dre, go steal Cookies' master music, Thirsty suggests. But Dre won't hurt his mom because he's trying to make nice.\nNot that type of girl\nAt Lyon Dynasty, Hakeem and his new singer Laura (Jamila Velazquez) have a falling out after he tries to come on to her. She's a good girl and doesn't want to sleep her way to fame, which is something Hakeem is not used to.\nThe break in\nChuck Hodes/FOX Guest star Jamila Velazquez (l.) and Serayah McNeill in the latest episode of Fox's \"Empire.\" Cookie and her hunky promoter are warned by Whoopty that there's an intruder in the house. Enter two thieves, who were hired by Lucious to steal Dynasty's master tracks. They both pull out guns on the thugs and kick them out of the studio. \"You packing?\" Cookie flirtatiously asks the promoter. Yes, she likes the big guns.\nConfessing his sins\nDre and Hakeem meet at Jamal's apartment where the eldest Lyon son reveals he was the one who set up the studio break-in where Jamal almost got shot. He begs for forgiveness and asks his little bros if they will come to his baptism. \"I want the family to be whole again,\" Dre pleads.\nThis guy is coming clean. After seeing his brothers, he pays a visit to Lucious where he admits he wanted to hurt him by committing suicide. \"I wanted to die.\" Dad doesn't believe in God or baptisms. He doesn't need to see his eldest \"dunk in tap water.\" \"There's no God, man the hell up,\" Lucious says.\nThe Chase\nHakeem isn't used to getting rejected by girls so he goes after Laura to apologize. \"I don't care about money or fame, I like making people happy,\" she says. Hakeem can learn a thing or two from this one.\nLike father, like daughter\nLucious is in the studio helping Freda with her new track. He has a change of heart and decides to show his support for Dre and attend the baptism despite his religious views.\nChuck Hodes/FOX Guest star Adam Rodriguez plays a hunky promoter in the latest episode of Fox's \"Empire.\" Forgive them, they know not what they do\n\"Babies don't know what sins are,\" Cookie tells Dre, revealing why she never baptized him when he was small. When her oldest baby tries to confess that he helped bury Vernon she shushes him. \"We are good people. You wouldn't be here if you weren't.\"\nAs she waits (with Jamal and Hakeem) to see if Lucious shows, she quips, \"the devil walk in here, this whole place might catch fire.\"\nHe eventually shows, but has to leave after he has yet another flashback about his mentally ill mom (Kelly Rowland). The latest revelation: she tried to baptise a young Lucious in their bathroom during one of her manic episodes. Poor Lucious, no wonder he's so hard up on Dre. Before he storms out, Cookie hands him a bug and tells him to stop trying to \"turn us into sinners like you.\"\nDanger ahead\nIn the final scene, a shirtless Hakeem (nice abs, by the way) is jumped by a few burly men and thrown into a van.\nDid Lucious kidnap his son in order to take down Cookie's Dynasty? Or is there another devil among the Lyon's pride?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:14:45.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
