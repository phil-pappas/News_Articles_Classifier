You orchestrate an extreme dodge ball match with sex-deprived men and then have the winners rub mud on each other.\nThrow in a second kiss. And then dump two fellas. Clearly, this is episode four of The Bachelorette .\nAfter dropping his latest rap song last night, Kayne has stayed up all night in the recording studio working on a new rhyme.\nStraight Outta Western Australia. Source: Channel 10\nUnfortunately, he has to put his album on hold because Osher shows up with a single date card. The boys all say they’d love a date with Sam, but they seem to love rubbing up against each other so much that, when Alex scores the date, no one is really devastated.\nLet’s spoon. Source: Channel 10\nTo be honest, this one-on-one date is a bit of a snooze. Alex and Sam spend the first half flying around in a couple of tiny planes.\nBoth of them gush that the experience is so great because it’s intense and brings them closer together — even though they’re seated in separate planes, flying around for an hour with no direct contact with each other.\nAn intimate 200m apart. Source: Channel 10\nDisembarking the aircraft, they head to the botanic gardens for a picnic and Sam uses it as an opportunity to ask the hard questions.\n“Have you been anywhere or everywhere?” she asks.\nHe brags about having been to both.\n“I’ve always wanted to travel. I’ve only been to London, Vietnam and then I went to South Africa,” she says, not feeling the need to explain the well-documented reason of why and how she ended up in South Africa.\nSam’s really taken with Alex because his Geri Halliwell accent makes him sound cultured and gentlemanly.\nSam says she usually goes for the “larrikin”, “smart ass guys” and that that’s where she’s gone wrong in the past. I guess we can grab a thick black pen and put a cross through Davey’s face immediately.\nShe’s so taken with Geri that she gives him a rose stump.\nThey then enter a perspex box filled with butterflies and kiss.\nGirl Power! Source: Channel 10\nWhen Alex returns to the mansion, we’re made go back to year seven where it’s vital to discuss the exact details of a kiss and then do impressions for our friends.\nThe boys are told about the kiss and they think it’s the first one of the series because Sasha has still been keeping his pash from last night top secret.\nSasha gets jealous of Alex’s taste-test, and while he’s bursting to yell “I pashed her first!” he contains himself and just asks a series of rapid fire questions to evaluate who’s was better.\n“Are we talking open mouth? Are we talking use of the tongue? How long did you hold?” Sasha grills Alex.\nWhen Alex describes it as a three second peck, Sasha feels the need to do an impression of the kiss in midair to ensure he’s got the right idea.\nFYI Sasha’s 30. Source: Channel 10\nWe stay here in year seven for the group date.\nDavey, Richie, Sasha, Will, Kayne and Dave are all taken to some kind of trampoline emporium for a match of extreme dodge ball.\nThe boys are divided into two teams. Red: Richie, Will and Kayne. Blue: Davey, Sasha and Dave.\nNote to producers: Matching Richie’s outfit to his hair kinda washed him out.\nThe only good thing about this date is seeing the boys in shorts, singlets and knee high socks. And Will sitting like this:\n#masc Source: Channel 10\nRunning into the “arena”, Richie says he feels like Russell Crowe in Gladiator . Not a lot of people know this, but the Colosseum is actually made out of really old trampolines.\nA scene from the Academy Award winning film Gladiato r. Source: Channel 10\nThe show hasn’t seen this many balls in the one room since the first episode. And if you thought this date was just a fun game, you’re wrong. These adult men approach the challenge with the same amount of seriousness they should be applying to the fulltime jobs they’re avoiding to be on this show.\nThe cockiness is springing off the trampolined walls. It’s truly overwhelming/embarrassing.\nRed win, which means the three boys get to shoot the breeze with Sam while wearing hessian bags in a communal bathroom.\n#ThreadbareDon’tCare Source: Channel 10\nSam then fingerpaints each boy with mud.\nSuch sexy Source: Channel 10\nAnd then the fellas get a chance to paw at Sam’s body.\nSasha, Kayne and Will and their sticks in the mud. Source: Channel 10\nThe spa treatments they continue to perform on each other are about as sexy and sensual as a used Biore pore strip.\nRichie gets some time with Sam wading in a spa filled with petals. They talk about stuff but I can’t tell you exactly what they said because it’s a bathroom and it’s really echoey.\nWashed, pampered and with newly acquired fungal infections from not wearing thongs in the communal bathroom, the boys head to the cocktail party where it’s all about arts and craft.\nTwo of the boys have been busy at Spotlight and have fashioned some rubbish gifts to give to Sam.\nFirst up, Michael presents his effort.\nShe thinks it’s a mix tape but it’s actually just a deck of cards with “random facts about Michael” written on them. To be honest, a fun mix tape would have been better. A little top 40. Maybe some Alanis.\nAnyway, these cards give us a lot of intel into the kind of complex man Michael is.\nFor example, his favourite numbers are eight, four and 11. He lives alone.\nFunnily, he doesn’t include any facts about his elite, made-up soccer career or the fact he founded Cadbury and owns the moon.\nBut he does give a voucher for a kiss. Sam doesn’t redeem it, but maybe she’s just waiting to use it with a bigger purchase.\nNon transferable. Source: Channel 10\nSasha’s been watching the craft segments on Better Homes & Gardens and gifts Sam with a drawing she can either hang on her wall or leave in the boot of her car until she drives past a charity donation bin.\nNo refunds. Source: Channel 10\nWhat’s weird is, these guys are totally safe anyway and don’t need to impress Sam with crappy gifts.\nWhen it comes time for the rose ceremony, it’s revealed two guys are getting sent home. Sam powers through, distributing the rose stumps until we’re left with Davey, Will and Kieren.\nJust like your annoying little brother’s annoying best friend who refuses to go home, Davey somehow stays in.\nKieren’s out. And Tim Rogers returns to fronting the Australian alternative rock band You Am I.\nTim Rogers, annoying brother’s friend, a guy.
