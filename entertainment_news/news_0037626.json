According to Heroic Hollywood, Joe Cornish (\" Attack the Block \") and Shane Black (\" Iron Man 3 \") are in contention for the directorial gig. Last month, Wyatt dropped out of the project and caused the delay in the production. Filming was supposed to commence in November, but now has been pushed back to March 2016. Recently, a source suggested that star Channing Tatum was considering \" Edge of Tomorrow \" director Doug Liman to tackle \"Gambit\". Thus, there are three contenders to bring the Cajun mutant to the big screen: Cornish, Black and Liman. Cornish hasn't directed a feature film since his last hit \"Attack the Block\", but he got story and screenplay credit in this year's Marvel movie \" Ant-Man \". Black is a screenwriter-turned-director who had a massive success by directing \"Iron Man 3\", which generated $1.2 billion globally. He is currently in post production on his next film \" The Nice Guys \" starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling . As for Liman, his other notable credit was \" The Bourne Identity \". So far, Tatum and Lea Seydoux are the only confirmed cast members. Besides starring, Tatum produces the movie alongside Lauren Shuler Donner, Reid Carolin and Simon Kinberg. The superhero movie is due to arrive Statesides on October 7, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Gambit News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:44:29.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
