Excelling in art from an early age, he studied art at Western Michigan University and took as many life drawing classes as he could. He spent a number of years performing as a singer/songwriter in clubs and coffee houses; and released several recordings, both as a solo artist and with his wife Tammy before he quit playing music professionally and devoted himself full-time to painting. \nIn the mid-1990s, while painting on Monhegan Island, Moeller met resident artist and fellow musician Don Stone (1929 - 2015), who became his most important mentor and a dear friend. Over the years, Stone shared many stories about the painters in his life, as well as the lessons he learned from them. In recent years, Moeller has taught numerous painting workshops on Monhegan Island, as well as a plein air master class at the New Hampshire Institute of Art. He also travels frequently to France and Italy, to lead workshops and paint. \nVan Hook also is a highly regarded and well-established plein air painter. Born and raised in a northern suburb of Philadelphia, Van Hook was exposed early on to the culture of one of the country’s oldest cities. His family also owned a farm in Pennsylvania’s rural Bucks County. As a young student, Van Hook had the good fortune to traverse Europe on a filmmaking expedition. He exhibited an early reverence for European traditions by spending hours in the Louvre copying the old masters. \nVan Hook has also spent many summers painting around the Midcoast area of Rockland, Camden and Rockport Harbor and on North Haven Island, where his wife’s family owned property adjacent to the famous Boston artist Frank Benson. This summer, George painted his way up the coast of Maine and the gallery is currently showing the fruits of this plein air adventure, alongside the work of Moeller and more than 40 other artists. \nLocated on the Public Landing, Camden Falls Gallery is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, call 470-7027 or visit camdenfallsgallery.com. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
