LOUIS -- Several shots were fired outside Sumner High School right after the second half kickoff of a football game there Friday night between Gateway and Vashon high schools.\nThe incident happened shortly after 8 p.m. The shots came from near the field. The shots were so close you could smell the gunpowder, witnesses said. After a few minutes of players and spectators taking cover, coaches and officials met at the field and decided to resume play.\nPolice cars circled the area shortly after the gunshots, and it appears most fans stayed for the game.\nAround the time of the shooting, a male victim in his 20s was found in a vehicle, about a mile and a half from the school, with a gunshot wound behind his ear, and he was taken to a hospital. This may have been the result of a rolling gun battle between two vehicles, but it was unclear if it was related to the shooting near the school.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1731875&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1731875", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1731875&h=Shots+fired+outside+football+game+at+high+school+in+St%2E+Louis"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:32:16.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
