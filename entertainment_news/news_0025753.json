The singer's incredible take on the classic song from 1994's \"The Lion King\" was officially debuted on Tuesday, October 20. The original track was composed and performed by Elton John . Derulo puts his R&B spin on his version, which is a mash-up of the piano-driven ballad with another \"Lion King\" tune, \"Nants' Ingonyama\". \"I felt like it was the song that touched me the most out of all Disney movies, out of all Disney songs that I've experienced,\" Derulo said of his \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" cover. \"When that song plays within the Lion King, it just makes you feel something. It brings you to tears.\" \"Even watching that movie as a grown-up, I mean I feel like that song just brings something out of you. At any age. You know, you can go to see the 'Lion King' on Broadway, and that song just makes you feel something instantly,\" he added. The \"We Love Disney\" compilation set is scheduled to be released on October 30 through Varve Records. In addition to Derulo, it will feature other big names like Gwen Stefani , Ariana Grande , Fall Out Boy and more covering Disney's classic tunes. Just a day before Derulo's cover arrived, Jessie J 's version of \"Part of Your World\" came out online. The British singer did amazing job singing the beloved track from 1989's \"The Little Mermaid\". \"When I was little, I literally loved this song, and I always wanted to be able to sing it, combing my hair with a fork,\" she said. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:53:07.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
