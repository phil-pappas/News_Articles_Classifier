Choreographed by world champion Parris Goebel and featuring some of the best hip hop dancers in the world, Born to Dance also stars Stan Walker and American actress Kerington Payne (So You Think You Can Dance, Fame). \nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, where Variety’s Peter Debruge reviewed the film as \"Proof that Maori dancers can bust a move with the best of them, Born to Dance serves as an astonishing Kiwi choreography showcase, the biggest and by far more impressive of its kind to originate Down Under.\" \nNZ Herald reviewer Francesca Rudkin said \"Internationally acclaimed South Auckland hip-hop superstar Parris Goebel turns this classic follow-your-dreams dance story into something special, thanks to her electrifying, unique style of choreography and incredible troupe of dancers\" and advised readers to \"Go and be blown away by the ridiculous dance talent this country has to offer.\" \nProduced by Jill Macnab, Leanne Saunders and Daniel Story, Born to Dance was made with investment from the New Zealand Film Commission, NZ On Air and MTS. Production partners include Fulcrum Media Finance and Media Super, Random Films, Bakers Dough and the Sideshow Trust. World sales are being handled by CMG with Vendetta responsible for distribution in Australia and New Zealand. \nBorn to Dance is New Zealand’s first hip-hop dance movie and is currently playing on 70 screens across New Zealand. It will release on screens in Australia on Nov 5th. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
