Call it “Jurassic Parkour.”\nReko Rivera — a former competitor on “American Ninja Warrior” — ran through a mock couse wearing a T-Rex costume, all while the camera was rolling.\nLucky for the Internet, the footage is on YouTube in a video aptly titled \"American Ninja-Saurus.\"\nFor all the elements of the course Rivera managed to conquer, his moments of failure — such as running up the warped vertical wall only to miss the edge by a few feet because of the tiny arms — are the true highlights.\nThe video was filmed at FTC Ninja Warrior Course in Palmetto, Fla. and captured by Brentwood Photography.\nnparco@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6Pe1zQ1ySE"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:37:07.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
