The song follows a vintage feel, melody and instrumentation, and Shreya's voice is the standout in this song. The next song Ooru Erayyindi Eru Horettindi sung by Shankar Mahadevan is an elegant and feel-good song, and follows the pattern of beautiful vocal lines and retro instrumentation. The chorus is catchy. Nijamenani Nammani sung by the masterful Shreya Ghoshal is a slow, brooding song with an emotional vibe flowing through the song. The table and Carnatic string sections add the gravitas to this musical masterpiece. The next song Bhaga Bhagamani sung by Vijay Prakash is a war song with elaborate use of drums, but is not up to the mark of the rest of the songs in the album. The final song Raa Mundadugeddam sung by Vijay Prakash and Heerti Sagathia is an anthemic and patriotic song and the lyrics of this song are the highlight. On the whole, the themed style of the album is a delightful change from the song and dance routine seen these days.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:42:17.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
