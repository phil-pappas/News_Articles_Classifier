We were celebrating and then suddenly the texts just started coming from our friends, from our mothers, from our exercise instructors, being like, 'Finally! It's your time!' And we kind of looked at each other and said, 'Oh God! What have we done?'\" Dunham recalled on Friday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show . \nDunham said the two decided they didn't have to get engaged right then. \"We're not going to suddenly just get engaged because it became legal,\" she said. \"Like, we better wait for a moment when we felt excited about this.\" \nThe Golden Globe Award-winner clarified she still wants to marry Antonoff. \"I'm excited to marry him at some point but it felt like a lot of pressure to just go for it that day,\" she explained. \nDunham even admitted that perhaps she was using gay marriage as an excuse not to wed. \"I did start to ask, 'Are there a lot of heterosexuals using this as an excuse to avoid commitment?' And I think the answer is yes because, I mean, we own a dog together, we have a home together, but the marriage thing is a big deal.\" \nNow, the actress says she doesn't want to marry anybody, because she's \"intimidated.\" \n\"I don't want to espouse any stereotypes, but gay people are kind of killing it at weddings right now,\" she quipped. \"They're kind of winning at weddings. So I don't want to go in and pale in comparison.\" \nDunham and Antonoff have been dating for almost four years. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
