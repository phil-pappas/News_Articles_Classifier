Like the others, it wonderfully captures the reflections of a thoughtful, reserved, and amazingly expressive man.\nThe songwriter and session keyboardist toured in Kris Kristofferson's band for decades and contributed hit songs to Waylon Jennings (\"We Had It All\"), Charlie Rich (\"You're Gonna Love Yourself In The Morning\"), Joe Simon (\"Easy To Love\") and Dusty Springfield (\"Breakfast In Bed\"). He's occasionally played character roles in films, most notably three films directed by the legendary Sam Peckinpah.\nThis time around, Fritts benefits from the production of John Paul White, in his first project since leaving the Civil Wars, and cohort Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes. The younger, fellow Alabamians keep the arrangements spare and packed with feeling.\nFritts' voice is, as it always has been, a weathered instrument, and it's perfect for slipping layers of emotion into new tunes, such as a brilliant cover of Amanda McBroom's \"Errol Flynn,\" as well as updates of long-time Fritts favorites like \"The Oldest Baby In The World\" (co-written with John Prine) and \"Memphis Women And Chicken.\"\nLike an old friend who drops by every decade or so, it's great to hear such a one-of-a-kind artist offer up his particular brand of American country soul.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
