He was 86 and lived in County Donegal, Ireland. Mr. Friel died on Friday, according to news media reports and the Arts Council of Ireland. No cause of death was given. Vincent Canby , then The New York Times’s Sunday theater critic, spoke for many when he wrote in 1996 that Mr. Friel had long been recognized as Ireland’s greatest living dramatist, having “dazzled us with plays that speak in a language of unequaled poetic beauty and intensity.” These ranged from “Philadelphia, Here I Come!” which concerned an emotionally divided young Irishman on the point of emigrating to America and was nominated for best play at the 1966 Tony Awards , to “Dancing at Lughnasa,” about a family living in genteel poverty in the 1930s, which won the same award in 1992. Along with much of Mr. Friel’s work, both plays were set in Ballybeg, an imaginary Donegal village much like Muff, where the dramatist and his family first lived after moving permanently from Londonderry, also called Derry, in British-ruled Ulster to the Irish Republic in 1969.

For the theater historian Christopher Murray, Mr. Friel’s aim was to “take the spiritual pulse of the Irish people and find the dramatic form that will render the condition of universal interest.” Certainly, there was nothing insular about his work. Plays such as “The Home Place,” “Aristocrats” and “Translations,” all set in Ballybeg, established him as a dramatist whose pessimism was tempered with an infectious warmth, generosity and sense of fun. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It was these qualities that caused the poet Seamus Heaney, his contemporary at school in Derry and a lifelong friend, to write that Mr. Friel left his audiences renewed, elated, and “with a sense of rightness even though things have manifestly gone wrong for the people onstage.” Mr. Friel was often compared to Chekhov, and tacitly acknowledged this by translating “The Three Sisters” and “Uncle Vanya” and introducing characters from both plays into his own “Afterplay” in 2002. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He said he felt a kinship with 19th-century Russian writers, explaining that this might be because “the characters in the plays behave as if their old certainties were as sustaining as ever, even though they know that their society is in meltdown,” and “they seem to expect their problems will disappear if they talk about them — endlessly.” Many of Mr. Friel’s characters shared those qualities, though they never seemed “endless.” Rather, they spoke in ways, always lively and sometimes poetic, that reflected one of their author’s prime missions, which was to help restore to Irish English the uniqueness that he thought years of Anglo-English domination had taken from it. Indeed, Mr. Friel’s principal objection to standard translations of the Russians was that characters usually sounded “as English as Elgar.” Accordingly, the language in his versions of Chekhov and of Turgenev — he translated “A Month in the Country” and dramatized “Fathers and Sons” — had a lilt and lyricism that owed more to Donegal than to Oxford or London. Brian Friel was born on Jan. 9, 1929, to a Catholic family in Killyclogher, near Omagh, in what had relatively recently become a partitioned Northern Ireland. His grandparents were all Irish-speaking farming people, and two of them were illiterate. However, his mother became a postmistress, and his father was a teacher, as were two of his sisters and Mr. Friel himself. After what he called an “awful” two years abortively studying for the priesthood — he said it conflicted with his “belief in paganism” — he taught mathematics in schools in Derry, the city to which the family moved in 1939. He also started to write, primarily radio plays for the BBC and short stories, several of which were published by The New Yorker and collected in book form. A crucial event came in 1963, when he was invited to the newly opened Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis by its founder, Tyrone Guthrie, who had been impressed by Mr. Friel’s short stories and saw promise in his “The Enemy Within” and “The Blind Mice,” plays first staged in Dublin. There, he observed Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and others at work and decided on a career as a dramatist. A year later, his “Philadelphia, Here I Come!” received its premiere at the Dublin Theater Festival. The play triumphed on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks to the imagination and sharpness with which it evoked the pains of staying in Ireland and the perils of leaving it. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Then came a world premiere on Broadway, “The Loves of Cass McGuire,” about the disappointments of a rough, drunken, but good-hearted waitress when she leaves New York for her native Ireland. However, Mr. Friel’s Broadway fortunes in the 1960s and ’70s were decidedly mixed, with only “Lovers” in 1968 proving successful. “Cass McGuire” closed after just 20 performances, “The Mundy Scheme” after two, “The Freedom of the City” after nine and, although James Mason played the peripatetic shaman at the center of its four interlocking monologues, “Faith Healer” after 20. However, his reputation in Ireland and Britain grew, with “The Freedom of the City” attracting particular interest, since it involved the deaths of three innocuous citizens on “Bloody Sunday,” Jan. 30, 1972, when unarmed civil rights protesters were killed by British soldiers. Mr. Friel himself was at the march and recalled diving for cover when the shots rang out. Though never active in sectarian politics, he always had nationalist sympathies, exacerbated by memories of what he called “absolutely terrifying” experiences of evading murderous Protestant boys when he was young. But though “Freedom” struck most critics as a characteristically temperate portrait of less-than-heroic victims of violence, it was not temperate enough for Mr. Friel. It was, he later said, a rather “reckless” play, written out of “anger.” That criticism could not be leveled at the plays first staged in Ireland in Mr. Friel’s annus mirabilis, 1980. “Faith Healer,” this time with Donal McCann playing a title character whose inexplicable failures and successes Mr. Friel admitted symbolized those of artists like himself, displayed the quality that would lead to many successful revivals, including one starring Ralph Fiennes on Broadway in 2006 that the Times critic Ben Brantley called a “mesmerizing” production of a “great play.” And “Translations,” in which 19th-century British sappers march through Ireland renaming villages in a campaign of linguistic and cultural colonialism, won critical acclaim both for itself and for Field Day, a theater company that Mr. Friel and the actor Stephen Rea founded in 1980 to take provocative drama on tour to socially and culturally mixed audiences in Ulster, then a restive and violent place. Though the company gave world premieres to Mr. Friel’s farcical “The Communication Cord” (1982) and his “Making History” (1988), which involved an Earl of Tyrone in Elizabethan times, his most important later plays received their premieres in Dublin. Prime among these was “Dancing at Lughnasa,” notable for its warm portrayal of five sisters who, like many of Mr. Friel’s characters, display resilience in adversity, in this case confronting financial hardship, personal setbacks and the embarrassing brother whose experiences as a priest in Africa have converted him to the paganism that, Mr. Friel suggested, underlies Ballybeg’s Christian surface. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:12:01.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
