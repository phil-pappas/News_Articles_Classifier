Carly Ledbetter Associate Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/19/2015 09:54 AM EDT \nChrissy Teigen and John Legend announced they were expecting their first child last week, and the supermodel recently took to Instagram to show off her growing baby bump. \nThe 29-year-old model wore a tight black dress in the new photo, which she captioned, \"Somebody is early to the party.\" A photo posted by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Oct 18, 2015 at 9:03am PDT \nTeigen instantly jumped on Twitter to defend her photo after people started saying it looked like she was having twins. \nI did IVF. One at a time. It isn't twins. I can see the damn thing. Get out of my uterus! — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 18, 2015 It's my own karma! I love bumps so I loved saying how round/big/beautiful they are on others. Don't worry, friends. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 18, 2015 Please stop. I put one embryo in. I have ultrasounds every few days. I didn't announce at a week. https://t.co/v17NlZjo1n — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 18, 2015 No more preg tweeting for me, lesson learned!! Back to food and reality TV and hay things — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 18, 2015 \nBefore announcing her pregnancy, Teigen talked about her hatred of \"nosy\" questions surrounding fertility issues with Tyra Banks on \"FABlife.\" \n\"I can't imagine being that nosy to be like, 'So, when are the kids coming?' Because who knows what somebody's going through?\" Teigen said. \"Who knows if somebody's struggling to have children?\" \nAnd though she's yet to announce a due date, we have a feeling we're going to see a lot more \"preg tweeting\" from our favorite celebrity tweeter. \nAlso on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:25:24.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
