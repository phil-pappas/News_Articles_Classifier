The studio, founded by Looking Glass co-founder Paul Neurath, has released screenshots and a trailer from the prototype. The footage follows an unarmed rogue facing off against a Shadow Beast guardian after stealing an artifact. The final version is planned to include three factions (Dark Elves, Dwarves, and “mushroom people”), the Improvisation Engine for greater freedom in solving puzzles, three intertwining classes (fighter, mage, and thief), and extended lore penned by Tracy Hickman. \nUnderground Ascendant is scheduled to launch late 2016 for Linux, Mac, and Windows PC. \n–", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:06:47.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
