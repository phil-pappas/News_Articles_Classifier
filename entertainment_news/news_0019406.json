Mark's unique perspective on how to effectively address adverse financial issues and poor retirement participation in the workplace led him to gather industry luminaries and profile their expertise. His twenty-five-year-plus background in retirement planning, along with the collaboration of six industry thought leaders and pioneers, offer insights on how best to take advantage of the rapidly changing needs in both the retirement plan and financial wellness arenas.\nThe book profiles the views of retirement and wellness experts such as Barry Kublin , Ron Bush , Kristie Howard , Mike Montgomery , Charlie Epstein and Bob Benish . These experts help provide practical solutions to help plan providers, plan sponsors and advisors make education programs even more effective. According to Singer, \"It is time to engage as an industry in thoughtful conversations about financial wellness. Employers can help change their conversations with employees by providing education on what their workforce is wanting and needing to learn more about.\"\nSinger went on to explain that, \"Overall financial wellness for employees should be a part of every employer's plan health scorecard... companies need to ask themselves, have they provided the tools necessary for employees to overcome financial barriers and stressors in the work place? It's a national crisis, and without addressing financial wellness we will struggle with helping Americans to save for their retirement.\"\nWorking closely with Kublin, Bush, Howard, Montgomery, Epstein and Benish, Singer was able to provide insights from plan sponsors, plan providers and the advisors who serve them. The book \" The New Financial Wellness, Changing the Conversation\" presents financial messages that should be responded to favorably by the industry. Singer said that \"it is a privilege to help people get their personal finances on track so they can prepare for their futures.\"\nTo learn more about Mark Singer and how he assists firms in achieving their employee wellness goals, or for his new book, contact his firm, Financial Literacy Toolbox, by visiting www.financialliteracytoolbox.com .\nAbout Mark Singer\nMark Singer , CFP速, AIF速, has over 25 years in the financial advisory business and in the last 8 years has dedicated his expertise toward finding innovative ways to enhance financial literacy within the corporate world.
