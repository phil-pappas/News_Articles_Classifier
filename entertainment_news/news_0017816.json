JESSE DINKEL , Related article » The other “Phantom” will open Theatrical Arts International’s 2015-16 season at the California Theatre of the Performing Arts in San Bernardino this weekend.\n“Phantom,” with words and lyrics by Maury Yeston and book by Arthur Kopit, is based on Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel “The Phantom of the Opera.” Yeston and Kopit’s production was first staged in Houston, Texas, in January 1991 and shouldn’t be confused with Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical, “The Phantom of the Opera.”\nYeston and Kopit’s version of the masked man and his love for the young singer is more operetta-like, follows Leroux’s novel more closely and offers a deeper exploration of the Phantom’s past and his relationship with the head of the Paris Opera House.\n8 p.m. Friday-Saturday, Oct.23-24 and 2 p.m. Saturday-Sunday, Oct. 24-25, California Theatre of the Performing Arts, 562 W.
