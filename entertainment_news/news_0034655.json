He was fired from the Chicago Fire Department, according to Ferguson.\nThe watchdog also recommended that both the Fire Department and Police Department workers appearing on the show fill out their own time sheets from the program, so as not to be accused of moonlighting there when they're supposed to be on duty.\nAnd the inspector general noted that firefighters have been trading work shifts with one another to get time off to work on the TV show, which he said is in violation of the firefighters union contract that prohibits trading shifts for outside employment.\nIn addition, Ferguson dinged firefighters and paramedics for bringing their own gear to work on the TV show in apparent violation of department rules.\n'Chicago Fire' to the rescue again ... to help Lady Gaga Tracy Swartz The firefighters on \"Chicago Fire\" have come to the rescue again.\nTaylor Kinney, who stars as Lt.
