Being at university had taught me that life is hard on its own and the more you grow, the more responsibilities you have and one of them is finding motivation to study even if it means studying with an empty stomach, studying with a lot I'm mind (family drama, your own internal wars) but the killer of them all is financial problems.\nOne is said to have a right to Education in our democratic country but one thing that has been omitted in that is the responsibility to find means to fund that education. University institutions are all packed with students doing their first year then being forced to drop out NO dropping out is something else which are financially excluded every year and who are seen as insane when they voice out their concerns via mass action while that's the only resort that grabs everyone's attention, problem is we are bad mouthed by the high management of these institutions and named as a bunch of students who just out of the blue disrupted class for no good reason.\nOur society fails to ask the big question Why is it every year these Insane students do the same thing each year?\nWhat goes wrong? IT'S like no one cares. How is one going to get that degree if no financial assistance is granted to them? The struggle of the 90's ended with victory now the struggle for the 20's has began For our right to education but with out the back bone Society we can do nothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:50:05.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
