Sometimes kid movies are actually good movies.\nEvery once in a while a film promoted as kids' fare will receive a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes. As strange as that may seem, it’s because these few films twist the conventions of typical childrens' cinema.\nOne that will attempt such a feat is \"Goosebumps,\" which will be released in theaters Friday.\nInstead of a normal adapation of one of R.L. Stein’s books, the movie combines worlds from various novels and pits Stein (who is played by Jack Black) as the film's protagonist.\nHere are other outside-the-box features that might appeal to younger viewers.\n\"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\" (2015)\nAs a television series, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" always had the odd dalliance with live action, including entire segments of certain episodes hosted by Patchy the Pirate.\nThe franchise's latest film is an actual mix between CGI and the real world, putting SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, Squidward and Mr. Krabs into brand new CGI models, in addition to the show's traditional 2-D animated style.\n\"The Muppet Movie\" (1979)\nEric McCandless/ABC via Getty Images The meta, self-referencing \"Muppet Movie\" invented a genre of comedy. What sets “The Muppets Movie” apart from other movies is what eventually made it (along with \"The Muppet Show\" and other projects) a genre of comedy.\nEverything that seems so standard for them now was fresh when it originally premiered. A group of puppets that love old-time show business, musical numbers and meta references? That's closer to \"Monty Python\" than \"SNL\" could ever dream of.\n\"Snoopy Come Home\" (1972)\n© 2003 United Feature Syndicate Charlie Brown and Snoopy's adventures have always dealt with melancholy, but perhaps never more so than in \"Snoopy Come Home.\" As one of the four \"Peanuts\" films released in theaters between 1969 and 1980, \"Snoopy\" doesn’t set itself apart for for working outside of typical showbiz conventions, but for what comes off - even for Charlie Brown and the gang - as an almost oppressively bleak tone.\nThe film, which nearly enters musical territory (though no characters actually sing), creates an origin story for Snoopy. In it, the beloved pup’s life pre-Charlie Brown is shown, with a different owner.\nHer stint in a hospital spurs a permanent reunion, that forces Snoopy and Charlie Brown to part, and they are only reunited because Snoopy isn't allowed in his new owner's apartment.\n\"Wall-E\" (2008)\nAP Photo/Walt Disney Co. Wall-E was a huge critical and audience hit in 2008. A movie that features very little dialogue and brings about a strongly pro-environmental message, tells the tale of a robot that attempts to clean up an earth that has been abandoned by humans.\nYet, it charmed kids and adults alike on its way to a $521 million box office haul and an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film in 2009.\n\"The Lego Movie\" (2014)\nAP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures, file \"The Lego Movie\" plays with the conventions of kids movies and more mature themes. This movie is actually telling two concurrent stories, when part-way through what appears to be a typical film about the classic toys, Chris Pratt's character is suddenly stuck in the real world.\nAs it turns out, there is a young boy controlling the Legos, and he’s having an argument with his father (Will Ferrell) for combining Lego sets, mirroring the struggle for power between Pratt and Ferrell's characters in the Lego world.\n\"Labyrinth\" (1986)\n©TriStar Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection A young Jennifer Connolly starred in the 1986 cult film \"Labyrinth.\" A Lucasfilm and Henson Company co-production that revolves around a 15-year old girl (Jennifer Connolly) trying to save her infant brother from a goblin played by the Thin White Duke.\nGiven Jim Henson’s typical schtick, it’s not surprising to learn that most of the characters are puppets.\nIt bombed at the box office, but the film and its soundtrack (which also features Bowie) has gained a cult audience.\n\"The Odd Life of Timothy Green\" (2012)\nIn a story by Ahmet Zappa , a couple essentially creates their dream child in the form of a 10-year old who appears to them out of nowhere. He also has leaves growing out of his legs.\nThe film then pictures the child attempting to live out every single dream that the parents (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) have for it, which eventually proves too much for just one kid.\n\"Enchanted\" (2007)\nAP Photo/Barry Wetcher/Disney Amy Adams starred in the Oscar-nominated \"Enchanted.\" Here might be the film most spiritually in line with what \"Goosebumps\" is trying to do. \"Enchanted\" combines the various movie worlds inside Disney the way \"Goosebumps\" does with the R.L. Stein books.\nThe film focuses on a typical Disney princess (Amy Adams) who is forced from the animated world into live action New York City.\nThe movie made over $340 million worldwide and won three Best Original Song Oscar nominations.\nslepore@nydailynews.com\nTags: news break , lists", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:38:28.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
