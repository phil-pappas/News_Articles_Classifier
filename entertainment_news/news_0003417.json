Â© BBC \"I want to be Miss Frances Houseman,\" she joked. \"I'm going to spend my entire Strictly experience pretending to be Baby and my dance partner Kevin is going to be Johnny in my head. Each week I'm going to pretend I'm in that film, even when it's not Movie Week, because for me, that's the dream.\"Bright added: \"The whole story of that film is what Strictly represents to me. When she learns to dance and she's really good... I just love that film and I am determined to get in the Dirty Dancing lift at some point.\"If I can do it, honestly that is a bucket list thing for me, so I can tick that off, because I have always wanted to be her. So if I can do a dance routine where I can pretend to be her for a minute and a half, I'll be so happy.\"Strictly Come Dancing continues tomorrow (October 10) at 6.20pm on BBC One.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:39:27.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
