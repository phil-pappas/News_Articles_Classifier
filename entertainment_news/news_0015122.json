Texas acts rock ACL retro style 1 / 3 Back to Gallery \nThe Austin City Limits Music Festival has long been a stronghold for EDM, hip-hop, indie rock and unadulterated pop. \nYet among the highlight of this year’s event, which is heading into its second weekend at Zilker Park in Austin, were youthful Texas acts with styles rooted in the past. \nFort Worth’s Leon Bridges , Austin’s Gary Clark Jr. and San Antonio’s Last Bandoleros rocked ACL’s opening weekend with retro soul, blues and Tex-Mex rock. \nBridges and Clark return for Round 2 (both perform Friday) with such hip names as Disclosure, Foo Fighters , Drake, Modest Mouse, deadmau5, Florence + the Machine and the Weeknd. \nAll three of the Texas acts are promoting new releases. \nBuilding on his buzz appearance at South by Southwest this year, Bridges took the Honda Stage on Friday looking, moving and sounding like a dapper reincarnation of Sam Cooke , the early ’60s singer known for hits “Cupid,” “You Send Me” and “Another Saturday Night.” \n“Let’s have some fun,” said Bridges as he and his excellent band launched into the rollicking, honking sax-driven song “Flowers.” He’s capable of cooing sweetly, too, on songs such as “In My Arms” and the gospel-infused “Coming Home.” \nComing home is the story of the Last Bandoleros. The Tex-Mex band includes guitarist and lead singer Jerry Fuentes , a San Antonio native who calls New York home, Diego Navaira and guitarist Derek James , also of NYC. All sing and co-wrote its debut EP, which also features Navaira’s brother, Emilio Navaira IV . \nThe Austin Chronicle describe the Bandoleros’ Saturday set at ACL as a mashup of Doug Sahm and the Beatles . \nThe Navaira Brothers back up their father, Tejano star Emilio Navaira, but Last Bandoleros is the first time they’ve embraced their Chicano roots in one of their own projects. \nFuentes doesn’t mind if the band’s conjunto, country and Beatles style is called retro. \n“It’s a super accessible thing that sounds like Texas but it sounds like American rock ’n’ roll,” he said. “I think we do really well at festivals because the music is real instantaneous. It feels good. It’s uptempo. It feels natural to us. We all play our instruments and we all can sing. \n“What’s crazy is that’s kind of, like, odd now … it’s not opening up your laptops and hitting play.” \nDiego Navaira called the festival gig “amazing.” \n“We attacked it from the first song we played to the end,” he said. “It’s pure live energy. I just think kids now are used to everything sounding the same. For the last 10 years, every song on the radio sounds like it’s coming out of a factory.” \nNo one will ever accuse Gary Clark Jr., whose latest record is “The Story of Sonny Boy Slim,” of sounding like factory music. His passionate appearance at ACL Friday revealed an artist who has grown since his appearance here at the first Maverick Music Festival. He’s exploring more than rock these days (though he did appear onstage with the Foo Fighters). \nExpect him to again unleash his inner Curtis Mayfield falsetto, Arthur Conley growl and Stevie Ray Vaughan guitar bends at ACL this week. \nhsaldana@express-news.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:27:00.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
