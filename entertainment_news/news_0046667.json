The actor will be seen romancing Chandini in the film, which also has Kathir and Sanchita Shetty as another lead pair. Directed by Arun Krishnasamy, the film is about two young men who cross each other's lives at a particular point.\nSays a source, \"The two leads lead contrasting lives. One is a carefree person who indulges in gambling while the other is a contented man doing something that he wants to do. Circumstances lead to a point where they end up meeting each other, a meeting that puts them in a precarious situation. How they get out of the danger and succeed in their love lives has been narrated in an entertaining manner by the director.\"\nThe film, which also has veteran Radha Ravi in a crucial role, has been shot in Chennai, Pondicherry, Bangalore and Mysore.
