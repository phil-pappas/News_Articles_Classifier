(Photo: Mark Bradley Miller) \nGreenville actress and singer Kimilee Bryant famously performed all three principal female roles in “The Phantom of the Opera” during her 10-year association with the long-running show on Broadway. \nAt her Warehouse Theatre cabaret show Sunday, she’ll poke a little fun at that unique experience. \nShe’ll sing a song she created that shifts lightheartedly from the music of the ingenue Christine to the diva Carlotta and the forbidding ballet mistress Madame Giry. \n“It’s a homage to doing all three roles,” Bryant said, speaking by phone before a rehearsal at the Warehouse Theatre. \n“This is the first time I’ve taken a stab at this,” she added, with a laugh. \nBryant’s program, “I’m Ready Now,” will also include songs from “West Side Story,” “Company” and “Into the Woods,” among others. She’ll be accompanied by pianist Walter Hundt. \n“It’ll be pretty intimate,” Bryant said. “I’ll even take questions.” \nBryant has sung many of the songs on her program in the past but they’ve taken on new meaning since the birth of her son, Aiden, now almost 19 months old, she said. \n“Children change your life and priorities and they give these songs great new meaning and depth,” Bryant said. \nThe words of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Unexpected Song,” which she’ll sing, are about a new romance — but they can also refer to the birth of a child. \n“I think about my son when I sing ‘I see your face appearing like an unexpected song,’” Bryant said. \nAnother ballad with greater resonance now for Bryant is “No One Is Alone,” from Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods.” \nAiden might make an appearance at her performance Sunday, she said. \nIt has been eight years since Bryant last offered a cabaret-style show at the Warehouse Theatre. \nBryant, a former Miss South Carolina, not only performed the role of Christine in “The Phantom of the Opera” on Broadway but in Toronto, Switzerland and on the U.S. national tour. In Switzerland, she sang the role in both English and German, sometimes on the same day. \nBryant’s other New York City credits include several leading roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, including Mabel in “The Pirates of Penzance,” Josephine in “H.M.S. Pinafore,” Casilda in “The Gondoliers” and Elsie in “The Yeoman of the Guard.” \nBryant’s experience also encompasses classical work. She was a soloist with the National Chorale at New York’s Lincoln Center and performed in a staged production of Handel’s “Messiah” at the Utrecht Early Music Festival in Holland. \nFor the latest in local arts news and reviews, follow Paul Hyde on Facebook and Twitter: @PaulHyde7 . \nYOU CAN GO \nWhat: Kimilee Bryant in “I’m Ready Now,” a cabaret show \nWhen: 7 p.m. Sunday \nWhere: Warehouse Theatre, 37 Augusta St. \nTickets: $25 general admission; $30 reserved seating \nInformation: 864-235-6948 or www.Warehouse Theatre.com Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LynogA MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:40:17.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
