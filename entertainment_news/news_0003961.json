The craters, located at high northern latitudes, are sliced through by thin fractures -- part of a network of similar cracks that wrap around the snow-white moon. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute\nThe region is punctuated by craters that crowd and overlap each other, showing a history of violent impacts. NASA has nicknamed one collection of three craters, overlapping and stacked in size order, a \"Saturnian snowman.\"\nCassini passed within 1,142 miles of the surface of the underground ocean-bearing moon on October 14. Its next close encounter is planned for Oct. 28, when it will come within just 30 miles of the southern polar region. It will be the craft's deepest dive through the moon's plume of icy spray , giving it a chance to sample the chemistry of the extraterrestrial ocean beneath the ice.\nNASA's Cassini spacecraft zoomed by Saturn's icy moon Enceladus on Oct. 14, 2015, capturing this stunning image of the moon's north pole. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 4,000 miles.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/10/16/1d0dcda6-72ac-44f3-85e1-182f5fbe8637/63ffc9ff0eb12ac3edefe2af7f4f7af7/saturn-enceladus-snowman.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/16/a6863f9a-0322-48c4-9aac-92cc3a54341f/thumbnail/620x350/1bdcdbf054c10de5cba6e9094a7bc582/enceladus.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:07:20.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
