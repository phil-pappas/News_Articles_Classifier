This photo provided by Lionsgate shows Vin Diesel as Kaulder in a scene from the film, \"The Last Witch Hunter.\" By LINDSEY BAHRAP Film Writer \nLOS ANGELES (AP) - There is not much cause for celebration at the box office this weekend. \"Jem and the Holograms\" became one of the worst debuts of all time for a major studio movie opening in over 2,000 locations with a truly outrageous $1.3 million. \nBill Murray's \"Rock the Kasbah\" barely did better, pulling in only $1.5 million. Vin Diesel's \"The Last Witch Hunter\" also tanked with $10.8 million. \nBut, while poor reviews might have sunk \"Jem\" and \"Kasbah,\" good reviews couldn't save \"Steve Jobs\" either. After two very strong limited-release weekends, the biopic failed to impress in wide release with $7.3 million. \nThe weekend of duds left room for holdovers to take the top spots. In second place, \"Goosebumps\" earned $15.5 million, while \"The Martian\" reclaimed its throne in weekend four with $15.9 million. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
