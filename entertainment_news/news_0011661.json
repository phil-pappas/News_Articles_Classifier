But last night on Monday Night Countdown, while picking between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles, Ditka pressed to add his name to some... on.aol.com Mike Ditka is denying that he passed gas on live TV. On Tuesday, TMZ and several news outlets posted video of Ditka’s appearance on ESPN’s “Monday Night Countdown,” during which it appears that the sports legend broke wind while talking to Cris Carter and Chris Berman before Monday night's game between the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants. During the discussion, Ditka leaned to the side as the trio discussed their picks, and a loud sound was heard. Carter began cracking up after the noise was heard.\nPhoto by John Parra But Mike Ditka is clearing the air on the incident. The 76-year-old NFL Hall of Famer and legendary Chicago Bears tight end and coach told the Chicago Sun-Times that he’s innocent. “It wasn’t me,” Ditka told the Sun-Times. “Believe me, I’m to the point in my life where it doesn’t matter. One day I’ll be happy if I can leave a fart. Right now, it wasn’t me. I don’t care what they think. They can think anything they want.”\nMike Ditka isn’t the first celebrity to be accused of passing gas on live TV. Last year, Whoopi Goldberg claimed that her reaction to an unexplained sound during a live taping of “The View” prompted her to pretend she broke wind as a joke.\nAccording to SF Gate , Goldberg explained her headline-making actions the next day on “The View,” passing off the gassy sound as a sound effect. The incident occurred as singer Ashanti was talking about her reluctance to get a flu shot, when Goldberg suddenly stood up and fled her seat. Then co-host Rosie O’Donnell used her arms to fan away the fake gas passing, and Goldberg joked that “breakfast burritos” were to blame. In 2011, a similar incident occurred on “The View” when the Oscar-winning actress said she’d “let a frog out.” ABC maintained the whole thing was as a joke.\nAs for Mike Ditka, sports fans are having a field day over this funny story. There has been no comment from Cris Carter, but his face in the video posted above says it all.", "external_links": ["http://blog.sfgate.com/dailydish/2014/12/11/whoopi-goldberg-clears-up-fart-gate/", "http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1031057/mike-ditka-says-fart-espn-wasnt", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/20/mike-ditka-did-you-just-fart-on-live-tv/#ixzz3pBvoZ0Qa"], "published": "2015-10-21T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:19:07.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
