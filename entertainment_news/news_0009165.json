Be it the most sophisticated musical instrument or just random scrap metal. His presence on stage can never go unnoticed, which was proved again at the inaugural of the Indian Super League. Fans cheered after a mellifluous treat when\nAR Rahman, lead percussionist Sivamani and over 20 other drummers, performed a beautiful rendition of the national anthem. “I am very happy to be here for football and Chennaiyin FC is my favourite team. I was delighted to perform with my brother AR Rahman. He specially said that we should play the national anthem in a different and a unique way and I was honoured to be a part of this with him,” he said.\nExplaining the concept behind the rendition of the national anthem, Sivamani narrated, “This theme and idea was inspired from those days when huge drums were used for announcements or information disbursal. We wanted to create a similar piece just through percussion. Rahman sir used sixty voices and 20 drums for this and that’s the beauty of it.”\nSivamani and football go way back to his childhood. “I have always loved football. When I was a child, my father used to bring me to Nehru stadium as I was football player in my school — St Paul’s High School. I became very nostalgic when I played there for ISL, all the old memories were refreshed. The feeling is out of the world. Namma Ooru Chennai, Chennai dhan,” he expressed.\nAdding that football is now gaining all the attention and momentum in India, Sivamani said, “Football must be encouraged along with all the other sports, in our country. Through leagues like this, football enthusiasts and kids wanting to take up football will get some boost. We now have leagues for badminton and kabaddi as well. This is great,” he said.\n Music Anandan Sivamani drum Also Read Drag queen Conchita Wurst tells Vladimir Putin, 'We're unstoppable' 'Miss Tanakpur' trailer crosses a million views Diandra will just remain a good friend: Gautam Gulati Aamir, Rani and Amitabh Bachchan catch up at YRF studios", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151005/entertainment-tvmusic/article/anandan-sivamani’s-magic-touch", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sivamani.png", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/sivamani.png", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-06T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:09:43.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
