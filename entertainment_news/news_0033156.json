According to TMZ , the 23-year-old songstress has been readying tour in support of her just-released album \" Confident \" and her team initially booked the former \" American Idol \" contestant to serve as an opening act. Lovato and Lambert had agreed on the essential terms, including money. They were already working on several things like stage designs when her manager, who also represents Jonas, convinced her to drop the \"Whataya Want From Me\" hitmaker from the tour and replace him with her fellow former Disney star. TMZ said that Lambert wasn't at all happy with Lovato's decision. The site claimed that he felt betrayed. A source was even cited as calling the switch \"very unprofessional and unethical.\" So far, neither Lovato nor Lambert has responded to the story. Lovato put out her \"Confident\" album last week. She was reportedly supposed to announce the tour last week, but delayed it because of the last minute change. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:06:05.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
