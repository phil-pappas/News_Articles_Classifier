Is Britain Racist? \nBBC Three attempted to answer the question in an hour long documentary (conveniently titled Is Britain Racist), using a series of scientific (and not so scientific) experiments. Some good points made in the #IsBritainRacist documentary, but the validity of some of the experiments are questionable. #bbcthree \nâ€” Lee Barber (@ItsLeeBarber) October 5, 2015 \nOne experiment involved people of different ethnicities and wearing different religious garments giving out doughnuts. The three participants were Deji, a black man, Richard, whoâ€™s Jew and Hanna, a Muslim who wore both a niqab and a hijab for the experiment. \nNaturally, Twitter didnâ€™t take well to this distinctly un-scientific experiment. \nFirst of all, what if those passers by just werenâ€™t feeling a doughnut that day? What have ya gotta say about that, BBC? Maybe people don't want doughnuts? Dumb experiment #IsBritainRacist \nActually scrap that, no one in their right mind would turn down a free doughnut. This experiment is a lie. Free doughnuts??? Oh yes!! #IsBritainRacist \nâ€” Riad Dustagheer (@Riad_d) October 5, 2015 \nHang on, maybe they were custard-filled doughnuts. This changes everything. So is Britain racistâ€¦.will we ever see such a poor representationâ€¦.and maybe they were custard doughnuts ðŸ™Š #IsBritainRacist \nâ€” jay (@32yid) October 5, 2015 \nWonâ€™t somebody please think of the calories! *Shudders* Tbf I wouldn't take a free doughnut from anyone. Black, white or purple. Calories are calories innit. #IsBritainRacist \nâ€” Lucy Mapstone (@LucyMaps) October 5, 2015 \nAre we really comparing handing out doughnuts to being outright racially abused? Is that actually whatâ€™s going on here? If they get racist abuse that's obvious but how can you compare how quickly they can rid of free doughnuts ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #IsBritainRacist \nâ€” Abigail. (@AbbieBebe) October 5, 2015 \nSome of us just donâ€™t like talking to strangers. I'm sorry but it's lost me here with the free doughnutsâ€¦ I always avoid people selling stuff on the street etc #IsBritainRacist \nâ€” Abigail. (@AbbieBebe) October 5, 2015 \nSome of us just donâ€™t like germs. Allow the donuts don't know where hands have been could of breathed on it coughed on it #Isbritainracist \nâ€” Miss D Baby (@Omalichanwa17) October 5, 2015 \nAnd some of us canâ€™t eat gluten. Does a gluten intolerance make you a racist? I'm gluten-free. No way would I have taken anyone's doughnut. Does my intolerance for doughnuts make me racist? #IsBritainRacist Share article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:39:37.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
