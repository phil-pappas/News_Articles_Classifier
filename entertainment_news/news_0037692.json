Cooper's drummer Glen Sobel filled in for Lee at the gigs, while he also sat in for the rocker during Motley Crue's final performance on the latest North American leg of their trek in Quebec, Canada on Tuesday. \nHowever, a frustrated Lee, who repeatedly posted the hashtag \"#f**kyoutendonitis\" on his Twitter page on Tuesday, wasn't completely absent from the shows - he has been able to use his right hand to play \"Home Sweet Home\" on the piano, while serving as the band's emcee. \nMotley Crue have a two-week break before heading to Europe to continue their farewell jaunt in Newcastle, England, on Nov. 2. They will return for one last North American run in December, before bowing out of the touring circuit for good on New Year's Eve in Los Angeles.
