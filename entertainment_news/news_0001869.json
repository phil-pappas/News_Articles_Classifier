He was taking her photos for her, leading her around the bar. The family was really spoiling Kylie. You can tell she felt like a princess.\" \nKylie and Tyga have been romantically linked since he split from Blac Chyna - the mother of his two year old son King - in 2014 but only confirmed their romance recently. \nAnd just because Rolly is literally the cutest thing...
