Chic is on the ballot for a record 10th time; N.W.A. is being considered for a fourth time.\nIn order to be eligible for induction this year, artists or bands need to have released their first single or album in 1990 or earlier. Jackson, who just released her 11th studio album, has been eligible for eight years; Cheap Trick, the Cars and Steve Miller Band released their first music in 1978 or earlier.\nThe public will be able to vote for one of the nominees for induction, along with the more than 800 musicians, historians and industry big wigs that are on the Rock Hall voting committee. From now until December 9, fans can vote on rockhall.com for the \"fan's ballot\" that will count as one of the ballots for the class of 2016.\nThe inductees will be announced in December and honored next April at a ceremony that will be broadcast on HBO later in the year.\nThe most recent Hall of Fame inductees included Green Day, Ringo Star, Joan Jett, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Syracuse University alumnus Lou Reed.", "external_links": ["http://rockhall.com/voting/2016-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-vote/", "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rock-hall-of-fame-janet-jackson-n-w-a-nin-the-smiths-lead-nominees-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:04:56.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
