And it's also true of every Portfolio we've done on Philadelphia,\" she said of the reports GPCA has produced over the last decade. \nSometimes deficits go up, sometimes down, she said, but they can appear virtually anywhere with any arts organization, whether it's a museum or a performing arts group. \n\"The difference between a positive year and a negative year is a thin margin,\" she said. \nIn the past, Portfolio has delivered increasingly detailed biennial analyses of the Philadelphia region's cultural economy. The most recent, issued last year, is based on data from 2012. \nThe new nationwide analysis presents the same kind of data, from 2009 to 2012, compiled by the Cultural Data Project, a Philadelphia-based organization that gathers information from more than 14,000 groups in 12 states and the District of Columbia. \nFor the 2015 Portfolio, the cultural alliance used data from the Boston; New York; Philadelphia; Washington; Pittsburgh; Cleveland; Chicago; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Phoenix; Los Angeles; and San Francisco Bay regions. \nNew York is so big, and the concentration of arts organizations there so great, that the city generates 41.5 percent of sector spending nationwide and is home to 27.8 percent of the total organizations in the report. \nThat said, groups in the New York region suffered the same kinds of declines in contributed income (down 12.9 percent from 2009 to 2012) and increases in total revenues (4.6 percent) that are seen across the country. \nAnd despite its huge total audiences, New York did not show the highest per capita attendance rate. That honor goes to Washington,when the free Washington Mall institutions are included in the mix, and to the San Francisco region when the Mall is excluded. (Philadelphia is in the middle, behind Pittsburgh, but ahead of Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago.) \nWhile the cultural sector nationally is slowly recovering from the fiscal crisis of 2008 and subsequent recession, contributed income has declined 3.5 percent. This comes even though giving from foundations has grown, as their endowments have recovered from the recession, and board giving is up. \nThe major factor in declining contributions income is a sharp drop in giving from individuals and corporations and the continued decline in government support. \nBecause contributed income constitutes 46.9 percent of total revenue in the sector, any decline in contributions is alarming. \nAccording to Portfolio, individual giving declined 9.7 percent nationally from 2009 to 2012, and corporate giving dropped 7 percent. \nBoard and foundation giving rose 20.3 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively. \nGovernment support at the local, state, and federal levels declined nationally from 2009 to 2012; city contributions dropped 29.7 percent, state support plummeted 35.6 percent, federal support fell 12.6 percent. \nIn this difficult environment, organizations managed to significantly increase earned income - funds raised through ticket and merchandise sales, rentals, and similar ventures - by 25.4 percent. \nTicket revenues rose 2.6 percent, admissions rose 9.1 percent, tuition increased 5.9 percent, and rental income spiked up 26.8 percent. \nSubscriptions, largely used by performing arts groups to lock in season-long attendance, dropped 13.1 percent. \nComparatively, Philadelphia is basically in \"the middle of the pack,\" Lyon said. \n\"We have challenges. The drop in individual giving is greater here than the national average. But, on the other side, the increase in board giving is greater.\" \n\"One big take away,\" she continued, \"is the importance of the individual.\" \nFocus on the individual builds audiences and builds revenues and contributions. Besides, Lyon said, \"that's who we do it for.\" \nTo read the full report, go to www.philaculture.org/2015portfolio .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:02:34.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
