The Pulp Fiction director referred to police as \"murderers\" during the rally on October 24. The comment sparked outrage among members of the city's police union, reports aceshowbiz.com.\nAs a retort, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's president Patrick Lynch said in a statement: \"It's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too.\"\n\"The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls 'murderers' aren't living in one of his depraved big-screen fantasies - they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem. New Yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous 'Cop Fiction'.\"\nWhile addressing protestors at his rally, Tarantino had fired up the crowd with a speech which was accompanied by images of those who have been killed by police, including Justin Smith. \"I'm a human being with a conscience. And if you believe there's murder going on, then you need to rise up and stand up against it. I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered. This is not being dealt with in anyway at all,\" Tarantino said.\n\"That's why we are out here. If it was being dealt with, then these murdering cops would be in jail or at least be facing charges,\" he added.\nTarantino's upcoming movie The Hateful Eight starring Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern, is slated to release in the US on December 25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:37:07.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
