Irfan said he was told that paratroopers landed at a poultry farm, close to the home of the main sharia judge of Hawija, where they launched their rescue.\n\"We are waiting for more information. A peshmerga official called us today confirming the news of the raid,\" he said, adding that he was told 15 IS fighters were killed in the raid. \"None of them arrived to this area yet but we are waiting for them,\" he said.\nCoalition officials in Iraq declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press.\n___\nJanssen reported from Irbil, Iraq", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:12:16.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
