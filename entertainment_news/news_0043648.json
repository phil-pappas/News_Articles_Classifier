The idiom is everyday, its origin lies in the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson . Now ITV is the latest to draw inspiration from literature’s original split personality in its own Jekyll and Hyde (ITV, Sunday) , a cartoonish, CGI-fuelled extravaganza. \nLike Frankenstein before it, this is the kind of gothic story that can be adapted in two very different ways. You can either take it as a dark allegory of man’s suppressed, atavistic urges. Or you can treat it like a great big Hallowe’en party of ghouls and monsters and eye-popping physical transformation. Airing in the family-friendly slot of 6.30pm, ITV has very much gone for the latter approach, with a result that is more Harry Potter than Sherlock Holmes . \nRichard E Grant as Bulstrode Photo: Des Willie/ITV \nIn an inventive twist on the original, the drama, conceived by Fast Show creator Charlie Higson , features the grandson of the original doctor. This blameless young Dr Jekyll (Tom Bateman) is living with a foster family in Ceylon in blithe ignorance of his monstrous roots. Except that when put under pressure, he gets the odd burst of superhuman strength and an urge to swap vaccinating schoolgirls for stamping on their heads. Cue a letter from a London lawyer seeking to settle the Hyde family estate, Max Utterson (Christian McKay), who summons our anti-hero to the city. \nNatalie Gumede as the sultry Bella Photo: Des Willie/ITV \nThere was a comic book-like aesthetic. We saw Dr Jekyll disembark in a London of misty docksides, swoon over a crimson-lipped love interest, Lily (Stephanie Hyam), and slip helplessly into his alter ego for merry brawls that were only missing the word “pow!” in a speech bubble. The violence was victimless, the sexy scenes sexless. This was knowingly kitsch melodrama. \nTom Bateman also stars in Da Vinci's Demons Photo: Des Willie/ITV \nLast night’s episode reached its bombastic best as Dr Jekyll made his first full transition into Mr Hyde. Lacking the pills he usually guzzled to control his “condition”, the meek young doctor learned about the death of his family and promptly had a bit of a Jeremy Clarkson moment . The veins throbbed in his temple, he gave a mighty roar and the next thing you knew, he had gone from lumbering milksop into muscle-bound brute. Bateman pulled this feat off with a superb, glittery-eyed swagger. \nLast night’s opener built up enough momentum to bode well for a lively run through the gloomy autumn evenings. It’s all good family fun, though older viewers might yearn for something a bit more gothic, a bit less comic book.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:02:50.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
