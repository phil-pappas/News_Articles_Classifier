Apart from the one with the 2CV, obviously. Pierce Brosnan as James Bond (PA) \nHere are the 10 most important Bond cars, their best gadget, and how much we secretly all want one. 1. Citroen 2CV – For Your Eyes Only \nBond’s slapstick escape from the baddies in this little yellow 2CV is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic nonsense on this list. \nRoger Moore’s Lotus Esprit had already blown itself up by this point in the film, forcing our hero to rely on a commandeered Citroen – as much a stab at British engineering as it was on Bond’s reliance on gadgetry, we suspect. \nBest gadget: Yellow paint is well known for enhancing residual values. Desirability factor: Still better than a Z3. 2. Lotus Esprit – The Spy Who Loved Me Bond’s underwater Lotus Esprit. (London Film Museum/PA) \nThe Lotus Esprit S1 is a peculiar, wedge-shaped car, which launched in 1976. In the film we see it convert into a submarine and dive into the sea, which is actually slightly more believable than its apparent ability to outrun a helicopter – with just 160bhp at its disposal, the Esprit was considered underpowered at the time. Promoted stories \nBest gadget: Submersible qualities helpful during wet winters and short trips abroad. Desirability factor: 6 / 10 – looks the part, but just isn’t fast enough. 3. (Flying) AMC Matador – The Man With a Golden Gun \nIt seemed like there were more AMC cars than people in this Bond film, with the goodies, the baddies and the cops all tearing around in cars from the now-defunct manufacturer. \nThe one that sticks in the memory is Scaramanga’s aerodynamically-unlikely Matador Coupe car-plane. Resplendent in a sort of brown-beige, this spectacular flying machine flew Britt Ekland “200 miles west of Bangkok”, though we’d much rather fly the remote-controlled scale model used in the film. \nBest gadget: You get to have a flying car, but the catch? It’s brown. Desirability factor: 8 / 10 for purely practical reasons 4. Aston Martin DB5 – Goldfinger 1964 Aston Martin DB5 (Alastair Grant/AP/PA) \nThe DB5 had all the bells and whistles expected from 007’s chariot, and stands the test of time as a result – the caltrop dispensers, smoke screen, an ejector seat and rotating number plates are all immensely desirable accessories to anyone used to driving in Britain today. This is probably the ultimate Bond car. \nBest gadget: rotating number plates make your car exempt from congestion charge Desirability factor: 9 / 10 5. BMW Z3 – GoldenEye \nAs James May once put it, “James Bond driving a BMW is like Douglas Bader flying for the Luftwaffe”. Q might have been forgiven if it was a classic, but unfortunately it was a lowly Z3 – another Bond car renowned in the real world for its lacklustre performance. \nIts mercifully short screen time of around two minutes was notable purely because the car didn’t get blown up at any point. Shame. \nBest gadget: Radar scanner and ‘stinger’ missiles amount to a weaponised TomTom. Desirability factor: Virtually nil. 6. Aston Martin V8 – The Living Daylights \nThe captivating roar of this car was probably the most rousing score of any Bond film. Ageing, British and brutish, the Aston Martin V8 was heralded as “Britain’s first supercar” on account of its 170mph top speed and its ability to beat the Ferrari Daytona to 60mph. \nIt’s also a muscular, masculine car – in contrast with Bond’s later succession of wimpish BMWs. \nBest gadget: Rocket boost wouldn’t go amiss on the M6 Toll Desirability factor: 10 / 10 7. Sunbeam Alpine – Dr No \nBond’s first ever car was a rather budget choice. The Sunbeam Alpine had just 80bhp at its disposal, making it a wheezy option for the Jamaican countryside. It didn’t even have any gadgets. \nWhat it did, though, was start a glorious tradition of Bond cars – one that has entertained fans for over half a century. \nBest gadget: Not applicable Desirability factor: You can pick up a fairly tidy example on eBay for less than a Fiesta. 8. Aston Martin Vanquish – Die Another Day 007′s Aston Martin Vanquish on location in Iceland (London Film Museum/PA) \nIf the ability to turn your car invisible at the flick of a switch appeals, then the Aston Martin ‘Vanish’ could be the Bond car for you. \nCriticised in the real world for having rather substandard levels of interior trim for an Aston, the V12 in Die Another Day had enough armaments to fend off a similarly well-equipped Jag. \nBest gadget: Imagine having an invisible car. Desirability factor: 5 / 10 imagine trying to find your invisible car. 9. Aston Martin DB10 – Spectre \nThe most exclusive Bond car of this list, the Aston martin DB10 was only ever built for filming. Just ten examples were hand built in Gaydon, Aston Martin’s HQ, so don’t expect to see many on the road. \nBut expect to see some more of those distinctive aesthetics in Aston Martin models to come – the DB10 showcases a new design language for the manufacturer. All we know for sure is that the new car will be called the DB something. \nBest gadget: A little early to tell! Desirability factor: Certainly wouldn’t turn one down. 10. Toyota 2000GT – You Only Live Twice The beautiful Toyota 2000GT is on the ground here (Sadilek Jan/AP/PA) \nThe Toyota 2000GT is one of the most beautiful models ever made by the Japanese manufacturer, and was responsible for a change in attitudes towards non-European sports cars. Monocles fell out, and sherry was spluttered indignantly across billiard rooms. \nBut Bond’s lady friend Aki went one step further with a special convertible edition, made just for the films. Vanilla 2000GTs sell for crazy money, more than their European contemporaries, and Daniel Craig himself says it’s his favourite Bond car. We’re inclined to agree.
