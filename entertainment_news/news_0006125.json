(Photo: Martin LeFlore) \nUnited Sound, Detroit Sound Conservancy team up \nThe Detroit Sound Conservancy is entering into a partnership with historic recording studio United Sound Systems that should benefit both. Carleton Gholz of the conservancy said they will store their growing Detroit music history collection (including a lot from the Graystone Ballroom) in the studio’s basement. And there’s more: “We’re going to be conducting tours for United Sound,” Gholz said. “They haven’t been able to both run a working studio and conduct historical tours.” The conservancy also will help raise money for United Sound’s historical plaque, which costs $3,500.\nUnited Sound was Detroit’s premier recording studio starting in the 1930’s. Berry Gordy Jr. learned how to produce records there; R&B greats Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John recorded there, as well as Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker George Clinton, rockers Bob Seger and Scott Morgan, and innumerable others.\nUnited Sound and the Detroit Sound Conservancy will hold an open house at the studio from 5-8 p.m. Oct. 23. Visitors can tour the studio and view many of the conservancy’s artifacts. The suggested $10 donation will go toward the historical plaque. United Sound is located at 5840 Second in Detroit. Call (313) 833-1833.\nHamtramck party for “Start Up” \nLocal television producer Jenny Feterovich (aka DJ Jenny LaFemme) gathered her production team recently to host a blast of a party celebrating the Season 3 Premiere of PBS’ “Start Up,” airing at 1 p.m. Sunday on Detroit Public TV, WTVS. On the show, host Gary Bredow travels around the country interviewing small business owners about what it takes to start a successful business from the ground up. Some 500 people came out for the party, held at The Fowling Warehouse in Hamtramck, a new business featured on the second episode of “Start Up.” The party, sponsored by Chrysler, provided cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, DJ Stacey “Hotwaxx” Hale , a dynamic live performance from blues diva Thornetta Davis and lots of folks trying their hands at “fowling,” a fun combination of football and bowling. Among several entrepreneurs featured on the show include Neville Wisdom, a Jamaican fashion designer who lives in Connecticut, offering custom fit clothing for women of all sizes at no extra cost.\nPhotographer Jessica Tingley at her exhibition, “Witness.”   (Photo: Martin LeFlor) \nWild at heart \nWildlife photographer (and former Detroiter) Jessica Tingley presented her latest body of work, titled “Witness,” at a cocktail party a couple weeks ago. She exhibited 21 large-scale images capturing various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat, work that showed her passion for photographing the beauty of Africa’s wild places. “I wanted to debut this exhibit in Detroit, so I called my friend Lisa Spindler who helped me secure the pop-up space for this event adjacent to her business, The Lisa Spindler Project,” Tingley said.\nShe sold several pieces that night and will use the money toward her charity, The Witness Preservation Foundation. Although she’s involved in work that often involves getting down and dirty, at heart she’s a glamor girl. For her party, the photographer wore a silk charmeuse blouse over safari pants and Valentino stilettos covered in Swarovski crystals (in a camouflage pattern, no less).\nswhitall@detroitnews.com\nchuckbennett@hotmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:35:23.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
