Exhibiting their work in the library gives the local community a chance to see what wonderful work is being created here,” she said. \nSale of these artworks benefits the artists, the library and provides an opportunity for the public to own original works of art, “so everyone benefits,” Henkel added. The Fall Exhibition includes paintings, altered books and ceramics. \nThe library, located in the heart of town, is open Mondays and Wednesdays from 3 to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays from 4 to 7 p.m.; Thursdays from 9 a.m. to noon and 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.; and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more information, visit stocktonspringslibrary.org . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
