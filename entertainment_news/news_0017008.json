If the rumours are true, what will happen to Dan and Maz? Source: News Corp Australia \nBut they haven’t been able to make an impression on the Sydney market either, with a disappointing 3.1 per cent audience share in the latest FM radio ratings compared to WSFM’s Jonesy and Amanda who are in front with 8.5 per cent and Kyle and Jackie O not far behind with 8.3 per cent. \nAccording to The Australian , the deal with Rove is understood to have been arranged by Southern Cross Austereo’s new CEO, Grant Blackley, who was the Network Ten CEO when Rove’s talk show was on TV. Could Pete Hellier or Carrie Bickmore appear on the radio show too? Source: Supplied \nIt’s not known if the triple Gold Logie winner will have a co-host on the radio show, but several stars of The Project are rumoured to have been approached. \nRove and his wife Tasma Walton have been living in the US since 2011 but he did a short stint as guest co-host on The Project at the end of last year. \nHe’s hosted several TV programs in the states, including an improv show called Riot and a game show called Lie Detectors . \nA Southern Cross Austereo spokesperson declined to comment about the rumours to news.com.au. Rove McManus and Tasma Walton have been married since 2009.
