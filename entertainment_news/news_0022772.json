But he says it appears about 90 percent of the affected photos will be salvageable. \nThe morgue also houses high-resolution micro-films of every New York Times front page and collections of photos of plays, movies and television program artworks used by the culture desk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:37:41.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
