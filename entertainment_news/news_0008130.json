There was no further word on Lamar’s condition.

She filed for divorce in 2013, citing irreconcilable differences. \nThe two were married in 2009 in a large ceremony that was taped for the E! network, which screens Keeping Up With The Kardashians, following a whirlwind engagement that was also filmed. Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian (Dan Steinberg/AP) \nTroubles that faced Lamar before and during his basketball career appeared to worsen after he left the league, and included a no-contest plea to drink-driving shortly before his divorce. \nHe won two NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010, and most recently played for the Los Angeles Clippers during the 2012-13 season. In February last year, he signed with a Spanish team on a two-month deal but a month later he returned to the US because of a back injury. \nIn 2006, Odom’s six-month-old son Jayden died from sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping in his cot in New York. He has a daughter Destiny and a son Lamar Jr, from a previous relationship.

He said the former sportsman “wanted to get away from everybody, wanted to have fun”.
