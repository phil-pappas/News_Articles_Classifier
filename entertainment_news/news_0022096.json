While the list showed most companies scoring high marks in senior management and corporate governance, most were found unsatisfactory when it came to procurement dollars spent with firms owned by African Americans and ethnic minorities - demonstrating a critical need to diversify this area.\nIn 2005, BLACK ENTERPRISE began publishing its list of the \"Best Companies for Diversity,\" identifying those corporations that proved to be the best of the best in executing policies and developing a culture that promoted inclusion for African Americans within their workforce, senior management ranks, corporate boards, and supplier pools. Highlights of this year's list include four companies with black CEOs, 59 black female senior managers, and 72 black board members across companies.\nIn compiling this year's list, the BLACK ENTERPRISE research team sent surveys to more than 1,000 of the largest publicly traded companies and global companies with significant U.S. operations. This year, BLACK ENTERPRISE gained support from the Executive Leadership Council, the pre-eminent organization of current and former CEOs, board members, senior executives, and leading entrepreneurs in producing our list.\nCompanies were evaluated based on representation of African Americans in senior management and on their board of directors, percentage of African Americans within the employee base and the procurement dollars spent with African American or ethnic minority group firms. There is still work to do in terms of major corporations fully embracing diversity; hundreds of companies were either unresponsive or declined to participate in our survey process.\nOf the 40 best, Exelon Corp., IBM Corp., McDonald's Corp., and MGM Resorts International were some of the companies that demonstrated significant strengths in the four areas surveyed.\nThe full list of the 2015 BLACK ENTERPRISE 40 Best Companies for Diversity is as follows :\nArkansas\nNorth Carolina\nWalmart Stores Inc., Bentonville\nBank of America Corp., Charlotte\nDuke Energy Corp., Charlotte\nCalifornia\nNew Jersey\nPacific Gas and Electric Co., San Francisco\nMerck & Co Inc., Kenilworth\nToyota Motor North America, Inc., Torrance\nPrudential Financial Inc., Newark\nWells Fargo & Co, San Francisco\nNevada\nConnecticut\nMGM Resorts International, Las Vegas\nXerox Corp., Norwalk\nNew York\nDistrict of Columbia\nIBM Corp., Armonk\nFannie Mae, Washington\nAmerican Express Co., New York\nGeorgia\nConsolidated Edison Inc., New York\nAflac Inc., Columbus\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, New York\nThe Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta\nTIAA-CREF, New York\nSouthern Co., Atlanta\nVerizon Communications Inc., New York\nPepsiCo Inc., Purchase\nIllinois\nAllstate Insurance Co., Northbrook\nOhio\nExelon Corp., Chicago\nMacy's Inc., Cincinnati\nMcDonald's Corp., Oak Brook\nNationwide Insurance Co., Columbus\nNorthern Trust Corp., Chicago\nState Farm Insurance Co., Bloomington\nPennsylvania\nAramark, Philadelphia\nLouisiana\nComcast Corp., Philadelphia\nEntergy Corp., New Orleans\nTennessee\nMinnesota\nFedEx Corp., Memphis\nGeneral Mills Inc., Minneapolis\nTexas\nMaryland\nAT&T Inc., Dallas\nMarriott International, Inc., Bethesda\nComerica Inc., Dallas\nMichigan\nVirginia\nFord Motor Co., Dearborn\nFreddie Mac, McLean\nGeneral Motors Co., Detroit\nWisconsin\nJohnson Controls Inc., Milwaukee\nThe 40 Best Companies for Diversity were acknowledged during the 2015 Executive Leadership Gala in Washington, DC .\nThe complete report, including methodology and selection criteria, is available in the September 2015 issue of black enterprise magazine.\nBLACK ENTERPRISE , your ultimate source for wealth creation , is the premier business, investing, and wealth-building resource for African Americans.
