For starters, it sees her collaborate with director Sai Prakash after two decades and that too for a film that is high on action, drama and sentiments.\n\"I play an auto rickshaw driver in the film, for which I learnt to ride a three-wheeler. Once I mastered the art, though, I even did an elaborate chase sequence and an action sequence in a rickshaw. I have great respect for rickshaw drivers as they serve society, often going out of the way to help people. But then, as with every field, there are a few bad apples, who end up giving a bad name to everyone,\" says the actress.\nWhile the film has quintessential Malashree movie elements like massy punch lines and action, it also sees the actress in a different avatar. \"I will be seen wearing saris in a film after two decades. And, after years of doing rough and touch characters, I had to tone down my body language for this role,\" she says.\nThe actress is quite kicked about the action sequences she has in the film, including an underwater stunt and more. But, most importantly, she says that the theme of the movie is such that will strike a chord with audiences, especially women. \"There is an underlying message that every woman can rise up to a challenge, be brave, earn a livelihood and contribute to the family income. Most women will relate to that,\" she says.
