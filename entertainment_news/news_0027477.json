The latest development is that, Kareena is now ready to make the collaboration official. The actress will fly to Dubai next week to meet the director for the script narration and signing the project. Shoaib Mansoor who made critically acclaimed ‘Khuda Ke Liye’ and ‘Bol’ had e-mailed his new concept to Kareena saying that she has a strong role in it. She liked the idea but wanted to read the script before giving green signal to it. Kareena who won accolades for her last ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ is currently shooting the last schedule of R Balki’s ‘Ki And Ka’. She will also be seen in ‘Udta Punjab’. In fact, Bebo will be the first A-list actress to work in a Pakistani project.
