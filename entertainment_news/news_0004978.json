It's quite different from the usual, adversarial approach we sometimes see and it's what made has made Louis Theroux one of the most well-known and respected documentary makers of our time.\nSo, naturally, when we heard he was doing one on Scientology, we were all excited. There's been several illuminating documentaries on the topic, including Alex Gibney's HBO doc Going Clear most recently. Theroux's vision, however, is slightly different. In fact, it's completely different.\nIn a recent piece, Theroux explained that he took \"inspiration from the showbusiness trappings of Scientology itself, using actors and re-enactments to recreate alleged events and church practices on soundstages in Hollywood, guided by the recollections of ex-members, who helped to direct the scenes.\n\"In part, this was simply a visual way of bringing people’s memories to life. But it soon became clear that the re-enactments would also allow me to question and probe those former Scientologists’ versions of events.\"\nIf that sounds similar to 2012's The Act Of Killing, the documentary which focused on Indonesian military officers actively recreating their brutal genocide of Communists with a film crew, you're not wrong. Theroux explains that he set the documentary up as him trying to remake alleged scenes from ex-Scientologists' accounts, complete with an actor cast as Tom Cruise and an entire Scientology 'bootcamp' that was run for the actors cast in the film.\nAs Theroux describes, the harassment came almost two months into production, complete with the usual amount of Scientologists filming Theroux as he attempts to make his film. There's no exact word yet on when the film will screen in Ireland - or even IF it will screen in Ireland.\nMy Scientology Movie is currently screening at the London Film Festival until Saturday, October 17th.\nVia The Guardian\nMORE: Church of Scientology targeting Oscar voters, says Going Clear is a ''propaganda film''\nMORE: Watch: New trailer for Steve Jobs confirms Fassbender's due an Oscar\nMORE: Watch: First trailer for Oscar contender Carol with Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/louis-theroux-my-scientology-movie-i-felt-like-id-been-blooded"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:06:05.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
