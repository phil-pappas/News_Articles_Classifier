By Jim Higgins of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 13, 2015 8:00 p.m. \nIn the latest example of its committed outreach to Milwaukee's African-American community, the Milwaukee Repertory Theater announced Tuesday that it will host the local Bronzeville Arts Ensemble in residency. \nThe agreement means the Rep will provide Bronzeville with services, support and a place to perform. \n\"We are in a time when African-American-led theaters are struggling to stay afloat. This opportunity affords us a chance to focus on our impact, on our art, and on building an organization that will serve Milwaukee,\" said Bronzeville producing artistic director Malkia Stampley in a statement released by the Rep. \"While learning from the staff of The Rep, one of America's theatrical treasures, Bronzeville will assist in their efforts to achieve greater diversity and community engagement.\" \nIn addition to developing new works and collaborating with other theaters, Bronzeville's goals include mentoring new talents and engaging the local community through workshops, discussions and other events. \nAs an actress, Stampley has performed in Milwaukee Rep, First Stage, In Tandem and Forward Theater productions. \nUnder artistic director Mark Clements and executive director Chad Bauman, the Rep has produced multiple shows with strong appeal to African-American audiences, including its current musical \"Dreamgirls,\" and has staged related events and workshops in accessible venues. \nSome local African-American performing and cultural groups have closed or curtailed their efforts despite doing good work due to business and financial struggles. The Black Arts Think Tank, formed in 2014 to sustain the Ko-Thi Dance Company, the Hansberry-Sands Theatre Company and the African American Children's Theatre, is another recent initiative to keep local culture alive. \nIn collaboration with Madison's Theatre LILA, Bronzeville will stage \"The Mojo and The Sayso\" Jan. 27-31 at the Stiemke Studio, 108 E. Wells St. The late Aishah Rahman's drama was dedicated in part to Clifford Glover, a 10-year-old boy shot by a New York police officer in 1973. The play explores how a family copes after their son's death. \nTickets are $25, $15 for students and artists. Call (414) 224-9490 or visit milwaukeerep.com . © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
