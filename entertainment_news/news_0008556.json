The Hulk is also set to star opposite other Thor characters such as Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) and Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander). Like Us on Facebook \nSo what does this mean for the story of \"Thor: Ragnarok?\" While not much has been revealed as of yet, it seems that Marvel may be transitioning towards a \"World War Hulk\" storyline as the character has been transported off Earth. Considering the last time audiences saw the Hulk, he was flying a Quinn Jet to whereabouts yet unknown. \nComing Soon reports that the events of \"Thor: Ragnarok\" will explain why both Thor and the Hulk are absent during the upcoming \"Captain America: Civil War\" film. This makes a lot of sense as the inclusion of either the Hulk or Thor on either Captain America's or Iron Man's Team will likely tip the scales too far for the other team to recover from. \n\"Thor: Ragnarok\" will close out the Asgardian trilogy of films which left fans in a cliffhanger after the last Thor film. For those who don't remember, it appeared as if Loki was finally able to capture the throne of Asgard as the god of trickery was seen disguised as Odin at the end of the last film. It has yet to be revealed how Loki actually did this. \nIt does seem that the Hulk and Thor will be coming to blows again during \"Thor: Ragnarok\", which isn't something new as the two have fought during the first \"Avengers\" film and the fight will likely be longer and grander in scale this time. \nThe film will feature a screenplay written by Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle. Both writers have previous experience working on Thor films: Yost with \"Thor: The Dark World\" and Kyle working on both previous movies. Marvel Studio head Keven Feige is also confirmed to be a producer on the film. \n\"Thor: Ragnarok\" is set to debut in theaters on Nov. 3, 2017 and is part of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie schedule. \nWhat do you think of the Hulk appearing in the next Thor film? Are you excited to see the two titans fight once again? Let us know in the comments below.
