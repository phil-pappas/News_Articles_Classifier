Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster. \nAndrew Lloyd Webber’s masterpiece is one of the most successful pieces of entertainment of all time. Its mesmerising score combined with a magical design and special effects, bring this tragic love story to life. \nBased on the 1910 horror novel Le Fantôme de l'Opeéra by Gaston Leroux, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA tells the story of a disfigured musical genius, living in the dark shadows of the Paris Opera House. Sheltered from the outside world in an underground cavern, the lonely, romantic is hypnotised by the voice of a young soprano. He tutors and composes operas for Christine and as her star rises, a handsome suitor from her past enters the picture. The Phantom grows mad with jealousy, terrorising the opera house owners and company with his murderous ways. And still, Christine finds herself drawn to the mystery man. \nCritics have described THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA as \"a thrill to behold and a sensual feast for the eyes\" and \"a gorgeous extravaganza\"… it will be a production not to be missed. \nTHE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has been seen by more than 140 million people, and the total worldwide gross is now in excess of $6 billion. It has won over 70 major theatre awards including three Olivier Awards, the most recent being the 2002 Oliver Audience Award for Most Popular Show, an Evening Standard Award, seven Tony Awards including Best Musical, seven Drama Desk Awards and three Outer Critic Circle Awards. \nTHE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA became Broadway’s longest running show ever when it overtook the record set by CATS with its 7,486th performance on January 6th 2006. It is the only Broadway show ever to celebrate anniversaries through 18 to 25 years and has been produced in 151 cities, in 30 countries around the world. \nProduced by the Amici Trust and bought to the Civic stage by one of New Zealand's leading artistic teams, the director, Grant Meese, says he is delighted to be bringing Phantom back to the city. \n\"Auckland has had its own love affair with this musical,\" says Meese. \"It’s been almost a decade since it was last here and I’m very proud to be able to introduce a whole new generation to this classic tale. \n\"As expected with a Lloyd Webber production, the music, the voices, the costumes, the staging are all amazing. Be swept along with the music of the night!\" \nwww.thephantomnz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:51:04.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
