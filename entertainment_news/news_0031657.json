DIY SOS â€“ here we go again tissues at the ready! \nâ€” Paul Finn (@Hillbillypaul) October 21, 2015 \nThe latest episode, part two of DIY SOS: Homes For Veterans, was no exception as we were introduced to triple amputee Lamin and his family. 20 mins in and already have a sopping handkerchief ðŸ˜¢ much respect for family guy #Lamin and the DIYSOS Team #DIYSOSVeterans \nâ€” Lady Max (@ladymaxbeaumond) October 21, 2015 Lamin is a true hero. This will make the things we all regret a live changing experience for him & his family #DIYSOSVeterans \nâ€” Katie Matthews (@_katie_matthews) October 21, 2015 \nAfter moving with his family to the UK from Gambia, Lamin joined the Irish Guards and served in Afghanistan. He lost both his legs and his left arm during the conflict after treading on an IED. Nothing but respect for Nick Knowles and his team but that nothing compared to the respect that Lamin deserves #DIYSOSVeterans \nâ€” Gav Meakings (@gavmeakings) October 21, 2015 \nViewers saw how he struggled to take part in family life because he was unable to get up and down the stairs of his current property to read his young children bedtime stories. He also couldnâ€™t prepare a meal in the kitchen because the work surfaces were too high up. Promoted stories Lamin just wants to read his kids a bedtime story I don't think that's too much to ask after all he has done for us #DIYSOSVeterans #diysos \nEveryone was pulling together on the build so Lamin and his family could have one of the properties being renovated in Manchester. DIY SOS is outstanding that guy Lamin is truly inspirational #hero \nâ€” Phil Dempster (@thebrynmilljack) October 21, 2015 \nIt was to include a downstairs bedroom and en suite for Lamin and his wife, an accessible kitchen and, crucially, a lift so he can get to the childrenâ€™s bedrooms and help with the bedtime routine. Lamin, his wife and his children. Inspirational heroes each and every one #DIYSOSVeterans @DIYSOS \nâ€” The Critical Friend (@SarahPryce) October 21, 2015 \nWe saw how Laminâ€™s injuries werenâ€™t just affecting him. We heard from his son, who explained he had to become an adult when his dad was hurt. Although he couldnâ€™t rationalise how his dad was injured. This choked me up a little, Lamin's son saying 'I don't understand how humans can do that to another human..' @DIYSOS too true", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:41:52.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
