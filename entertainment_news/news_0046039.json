Don’t get me wrong, Batman is a badass, but he’s going up against someone who is super strong, super fast, super invulnerable with super heat vision. I’m sure it must have been a challenge for director Zack Snyder to come up with a way to see these two face off that is believable for the audience. Batman does have an advantage over Superman, though, and in an interview with Total Film (via ComicBook ), Zack Snyder explains what that is saying: \"The advantage that Batman has is the goodness of Superman. The compliance to fair lay that Superman has... Batman knows how to exploit Superman.\" \nSo basically, Superman is a boy scout who plays be the rules, where Batman is going to fight dirty. We know that Batman will be wearing a suit of armor when he goes up against the Man of Steel, but I have no doubt that Batman will also be using kryptonite laced weapons when taking him on. We’ve got a new image from the magazine as well, showing the two characters in the heat of battle. \nIn another interview with 411Mania , Snyder also revealed that we would see a new trailer for the film soon, and explained what he would like to have audiences take away from the film: “I want to — we’re working toward Justice League , and I really want to create the — part of the thing I really want to create is the possibility of a world where they could exist together. I think up to this point, it’s been difficult to suggest a world where Batman and Superman and Wonder Woman and others could exist in the same universe. That was one of the things I really wanted to try and get at. Not to mention, the amazing opportunity to bring those characters and have those characters tell an important story, their own story, within the confines of a film.” \nThe filmmaker also talked a little bit more about the new Batmobile that was created for the film, saying: “You know it has all the kind of fun stuff. It has the countermeasures — we always talk about the countermeasures because people are like, ‘What the heck is countermeasures?’ You know if I shot a missile at it, flares would pop out of those holes and stop the missile from hitting it… So that’s fun. It’s got this crazy gun [on the front part of the vehicle]. It’s super-fast. It’s electrified. It can do all the other Bat-car stuff. But the cool thing I liked about it is that it’s a purpose built Batmobile, right? Which is kind of fun to get back to that.” \nTo catch up on some of the other recent details that have been revealed for this movie, click here .
