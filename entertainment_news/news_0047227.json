Season 4 was a significant “bounce-back” year for Homeland, even though there's no doubt the series could have wrapped up after Season 3. \nWith shows such as Homeland, you never know which seasons individual viewers are watching at present. So I'll issue a wide-sweeping SPOILER ALERT that goes back two years, okay? \nBesides Carrie, the character who made Homeland famous was Nicholas Brody, a “terrorist or not?” played by Damian Lewis. But even Lewis acknowledged that by the time Brody was killed at the end of Season 3, the character had overstayed his welcome. Watch the trailer for season 5 of 'Homeland' \n“(Initially) Brody was supposed to be there for two seasons,” said Lewis at the Television Critics Association event a few months ago, where he was promoting his upcoming Showtime series Billions. “What can I say? I think it would've been brilliant had he been there for only two seasons. \n“(Keeping Brody longer) did create some problems in the storytelling. In the first half of Season 3, some people were slightly confused by its direction and what the show was trying to do. But I think the second half of Season 3 was sort of extraordinary, in the way they dealt with hanging him and everything, it was brilliant.” \nSeason 1 of Homeland was one of my favourite single seasons of TV ever. Season 2 wasn't as good, but it was okay. Season 3 went off the rails, but at least the Brody story finally ended. That allowed a largely satisfying reset for Season 4. \nSeason 5 picks up two years after Carrie's ill-fated tenure as CIA station chief in Islamabad. Carrie now is estranged from the CIA and living in Berlin, working in the private sector as the head of security for a rich German philanthropist. \nCarrie has her daughter with her – Brody's the dad, as you'll recall – but of course, watching Carrie try to have a stable personal life is like putting an apron on a wolverine. \nSide note to TV writers: Unless your show is about families, no matter how tempting it is, please resist giving kids to your main characters. If your show runs two, or three, or four more seasons, those toddlers are going to be major plot impediments. I mean, seriously, how was Dexter's nanny ALWAYS available, 24/7, while he was out serial killing and such? \nAnyway, it doesn't take long for Carrie to get dragged back into the complex realm of the CIA, and to come across former colleagues Saul and Peter Quinn, played by Rupert Friend. \nCarrie and her mentor Saul certainly have experienced some ups and downs in their relationship through the years, and as Season 5 begins, it's definitely down. I won't spoil the circumstances, but when Carrie and Saul first see each other in the new season, Saul's body language is priceless. \nIt's just fun watching those two together, whether they're concocting a plan or spitting verbal darts at each other. Sure, the way they wind up back in the same orbit in Season 5 of Homeland is somewhat “convenient,” but I'm not going to complain about that. \nI don't necessarily need more Homeland, but I always want more Homeland. Does that make any sense?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:31:05.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
