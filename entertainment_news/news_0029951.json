Sometimes a little too confident. Having apparently triumphed over substance abuse, depression and bulimia, the mighty-lunged Lovato applies the same level of intense determination and personal revelation to her fifth album, powering relentlessly through empowerment anthems set to slick EDM, neo-soul and pop backbeats from high-priced talent like Max Martin, Ryan Tedder and Stargate. Granted, her self-assurance serves her well for the most part — but a little understatement never hurts either.\nRATING: 2.5 (out of 5)\nJoanna Newsom\nDivers\nJoanna Newsom runs deep. But hers are not still waters. Since debuting via the freak-folk scene over a decade ago, the California singer-songwriter and harp-centric multi-instrumentalist has challenged herself and her audience at every turn. And her fourth release is no exception. Coming more than five years after her sprawling 2010 triple-album Have One on Me, Divers arrives somewhat trimmer and lighter on its feet, clocking in at a comparatively tight and sprightly 51 minutes. But like its equally exquisite and enchanting forebears, it’s packed with seemingly infinite quantities of enigmatic elegance, breathtaking individuality and unbridled creativity. Compositions come in touching two-minute vignettes and shape-shifting seven-minute epics. Her stylistic palette embraces and encompasses baroque minstrelsy, cinematic orchestrations, pastoral folk, Appalachian balladry, country-jazz and more with seamless transition. The mood runs wildly from mischievous to melancholy to majestic. Her lyrics are nothing short of poetry, weaving a rich tapestry of internal rhymes, historical details and captivating references; you can (and fans apparently do) spend hours unpacking, deciphering and debating the subtext to evocative passages like “Beneath a patch of grass, her bones the old Dutch master hid / While elsewhere Tobias and the angel disguise what the scholars surmise was a mother and kid.” All of that, of course, is conveyed with Newsom’s sui generic voice. A wonderfully weird amalgam of quirk, strangeness and charm, it can swoop and soar like a bird in flight or creak and crack like an old screen door, delivering her meandering melodies with an off-kilter grace that finds a sweet spot between the church, the concert hall and the back porch. Little wonder her fans are rapturous. And little doubt you will be too.\nRATING: 4.5 (out of 5)\nRod Stewart\nAnother Country\nRod the Mod may be getting old, but he’s no old fool. He knows sexy, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. And that the ladies who think he’s sexy these days tend to be women of a certain age — the age when they’re interested in more than twisting the night away with a guy in leopard-print Spandex. So, on his 29th album — and second disc of new material since he started writing songs again — Rod gives them what they want: A (mostly) reformed bad boy. Now he’s a guy who tucks in the kids and tells them a story about superheroes. He’s a guy who wants to stay in with you a glass of wine. A guy who wants to take you to Vegas for Valentine’s Day. A guy who wants a soulmate to hold him. A guy who thinks you’re as beautiful as a classic song. And a guy who can still get a little loud and rock out occasionally, but prefers to mix things up with some reggae, Celtic pop and love ballads. That, gents, is why he’s Rod Stewart and you’re not. And if he keeps it up, we can all look forward to singles like An Old Pair of Sweats Will Never Let You Down, Hot Legs (and Sensible Shoes) and Tonight’s the Night That New Sandra Bullock Movie is on Lifetime.\nRATING: 3 (out of 5)\nEL VY\nReturn to the Moon\nTwo kings are better than one. So this week’s supergroup side-project stars National frontman Matt Berninger and Menomena alum Brent Knopf. The former supplies his usual baritone croak, arch wordplay (“Scratched a ticket with the leg of a cricket and I got triple Jesus”), pop cultural references to everyone from The Minutemen and Hüsker Dü to Erin Brockovich and The Beatles. The latter showcases them with a stylish array of eccentric indie-rock spiked with low-dose psychedelia and understated funk. Thangyavurrymush.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nBlitzen Trapper\nAll Across This Land\nEvery journey has to start somewhere. And sometime. For Portland singer-guitarist Eric Earley and Blitzen Trapper, the travelogue of their eighth disc begins in the ’70s California rock and country of Joe Walsh, Tom Petty, the Doobies and Little Feat. It doesn’t end there — other songs venture into the Midwestern folk of Dylan, the Nashville roots-rock of Steve Earle and the heartland grandeur of Springsteen. But Earley’s raspy pipes and bittersweet lyricism tie it all together into one supremely gorgeous nostalgia trip.\nRATING: 4 (out of 5)\n!!!\nAs If\nMost dance music aims below the waist. But as usual, typographically handled California dance-punks !!! — pronounced Chk Chk Chk for the newbies — also target what’s above your neck. Which means their sixth long-player is another eccentric offering that offsets its infectious grooves and bottom-heavy basslines with arch lyrics, treated vocals and plenty of experimental sonic weirdness. You won’t know whether to shake your butt or your head.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nNOW HEAR THIS\nBeach House\nThank Your Lucky Stars\nNo one ever accused Beach House of being speed demons. Until now. The Baltimore dream-pop duo’s sixth set arrives two months after predecessor Depression Cherry. But that’s where the frantic pace ends; these chilly cuts exhibit the usual gently floating ambiance and lulling softness — along with Victoria Legrand’s ethereal vocals. Thanks indeed.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nVanessa Carlton\nLiberman\nFamily comes first for Carlton these days. This fifth album — named after her grandfather — was delayed by marriage and motherhood. One or both seem to have mellowed her — the 10 songs trade the piano-driven rock and energy of her past for pulsing synths, gauzy production and a dreamy, escapist ambience. Great music for not waking the baby.\nRATING: 2.5 (out of 5)\nDave Gahan & Soulsavers\nAngels & Ghosts\nMore songs of faith and devotion. But no DM. Or EDM. Depeche Mode frontman Gahan tones it down again for his second collaboration with British production house Soulsavers, backburnering his day job’s synths and grooves for bruised, brooding gospel-blues ballads fueled by loss, spiritual abandonment and disenchantment. Hardly music for the masses.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nBlue Rodeo\nLive at Massey Hall\nGood timing, sure. But that’s not all. The country-rockers’ latest live outing primes the pump for an upcoming tour and spiffy vinyl reissues of Casino, Lost Together and Five Days in July. Marketing aside, this set captures a typically pristine performance of hits, highlights and classics, peppered with cuts from 2013’s In Our Nature. But where’s the DVD?\nRATING: 3 (out of 5)\nPuscifer\nMoney Shot\nSex! Now that Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan and his Puscifer collective have your attention, they’d like to discuss the lack of connection, perspective and responsibility in our society. And they’d like to do so over darkly pulsing synth grooves. If that means dressing up like rednecks, tossing in some prurient bump ’n’ grind electro and namechecking Beavis from time to time, so be it. Thankfully, as usual, they’re right on the money.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nSwans\nThe Gate\nYou want singalongs and singles? You’re at the wrong gig. The latest limited-edition live outing from musical maverick Michael Gira and Swans clocks in at 158 minutes, features several previously undocumented songs, half-hour descents into oppressively hypnotic drone-metal and demos destined for their forthcoming album. Not for the faint of heart.\nRATING: 4 (out of 5)\nCohered & Cambria\nThe Color Before the Sun\nThis time it’s personal. Taking a break from his multi-album Armoury Wars SF saga, leader Claudio Sanchez turns inward for his eighth album, penning a musical narrative about his life in New York City and new fatherhood. Fittingly, the band’s Rush-level prog also downshifts to slightly more grounded and streamlined alt-rock. Welcome back to earth, dude.\nRATING: 3 (out of 5)\nDeadheads\nLoadead\nChill out, hippies. This isn’t some tie-dyed San Fran jam band. These hard-rockin’ Deadheads hail from Sweden, favour black leather and denim — and most importantly, kick out their jams at full volume and maximum intensity, thanks to their invigorating mix of frenzied garage-punk propulsion and muscular riff-rawk power. Put down the bong and crank it.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nQueensrÿche\nCondition Hüman\nCall it Operation: Rewind Time. On their second release after replacing frontman Geoff Tate with Todd La Torre, the rejuvenated prog-metal vets head back to their mid-’80s roots with louder, faster and heavier songs that recall classic Iron Maiden or Rush — while retaining the complexity and grandeur that are their stock in trade. They’re in good shape.\nRATING: 3 (out of 5)\nLou Doillon\nLay Low\nOnce is fluke. Twice is proof. Singer Doillon — daughter of Jane Birkin and half-sis of Charlotte Gainsbourg — makes it clear she’s no dilettante with this entrancing sophomore set. Co-produced by Timber Timbre eccentric Taylor Kirk, Lay Low earns its title with slow-rolling piano ballads that showcase Doillon’s cracked vocals and smoky intensity. Highly intoxicating.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nDeerhunter\nFading Frontier\nTrauma changes you in unexpected ways. Even the unpredictable Bradford Cox. A year after being hit by a car, Deerhunter’s oddball frontman returns — not with a dark document of death, but with a surprisingly mellow batch of jangly experimental pop and psychedelic indie-rock that ranks as the Atlanta band’s most accessible, optimistic work. Go figure.\nRATING: 4 (out of 5)\nDilly Dally\nSore\nEverybody loves the Pixies. Plenty of people love early Hole. Now you can love them both at once. Or at least enjoy a band that sounds a lot like that. That would be Toronto buzz magnets Dilly Dally, whose muscular debut underpins frontwoman Katie Monks’ scream-queen vocals with raggedly heavy alt-rock a la Black Francis and co. What is not to love?\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nSupersuckers\nHoldin’ the Bag\nNothing stops Eddie Spaghetti. Not even the big C. Despite a recent battle with throat cancer, the singer-bassist is in fine form on the Supersuckers’ latest country joint. Sure, some of the lyrics seem to reflect his recent travails. But there are plenty of barnburners and honky-tonkers that catch him at his unrepentantly ornery best. Open your wallet.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nSteve Martin & Edie Brickell\nSo Familiar\nFamiliar but far from routine. While singer-songwriter Brickell and banjo master Martin stay rooted in contemporary bluegrass and Americana on their second studio collaboration, they (and producer Peter Asher) broaden their horizons by introducing everything from full-band arrangements to horns and electronics. Sweet, smart, soothing and sophisticated.\nRATING: 3 (out of 5)\nBørns\nDopamine\nNope, not the latest mononymed Swedish synth chanteuse. Garrett Borns is really a singer-songwriter from Michigan. And while he does traffic in indie-pop — and knows his way around a keyboard — his big bouncy beats, candy-coloured melodies and infusions of psychedelia and glam separate him from the Scandinavians. And hit your pleasure centres.\nRATING: 3.5 (out of 5)\nCold Creek County\nTill the Wheels Come Off\nBro-country is one Yankee trend we could do without. But like most things, it’s moved across the border — and into the hands of these opportunistic suburban Ontario cowboys. Their calculated debut disc is little more than a string of cliches about pickups, dirt roads, small towns and beer, set to a twangy amalgam of roots, rock and hip-hop. Yee-awn.\nRATING: 2.5 (out of 5)\nIN THE PIPELINE\nOct. 30\nTrey Anastasio, Paper Wheels\nCar Seat Headrest, Teens of Style\nPeter Case, HWY 62\nDef Leppard, Def Leppard\nDrive-By Truckers, It’s Great to Be Alive!\nEscape the Fate, Hate Me\nG.
