She claims the several hotels in question freely revealed Andrews' whereabouts including her room number and granted Barrett the room next to hers several times.\nBarrett, the Illinois man accused and convicted of stalking the reporter, secretly videotaped Andrews through altered peep holes in her hotel room doors. An insurance company executive, Barrett uploaded several videos online and planned to sell them to celebrity gossip sites. After investigation, Barrett pleaded guilty to harassment and stalking charges and was ultimately sentenced to 30 months in prison.\nAndrews said during a court hearing at the time she had been humiliated and embarrassed, \"and my career has been ripped apart.\"\n\"I am subject to crude comments,\" she told the court. \"I walk into stadiums, and fans make crude comments to me. I have nightmares about this sexual predator.\"\n  President Obama suprises San Diego couple during golf course wedding Victor Garber, Rainer Andreesen marry in Canada Buffalo Bills come from behind to beat Tennessee Titans", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:02:45.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
