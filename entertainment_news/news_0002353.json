The Hannibal showrunner will executive-produce and write the pilot of the anthology series, which recounts a different supernatural, fantastical, horrific or bizarre story each episode a la The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror . The original series ran for two seasons in the '80s. It was nominated for 12 Emmys and won five.

Fuller will also act as showrunner on the upcoming Neil Gaiman adaptation American Gods for Starz. Would you watch a new Amazing Stories series?
