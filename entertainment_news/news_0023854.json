But what helped him settle into the role was the fact that the character resonated with his own life as a lecturer before he turned actor.\n\"I play a very colourful lecturer who is entertaining, but in a crazy, loud and rather exaggerated manner. His ideas about the failings of our education system are similar to mine, which is why I decided to take up the film when it was offered to me,\" explains Kishore.\nAs a lecturer in an all-girls college years ago, Kishore says that his ideas and methodology of teaching were not accepted. \"The contention of the management and other teachers was that you need to write on the blackboard to prove a point. But when you are teaching a Kannada novel, other than the title, there is pretty much nothing else that can be written on the board. If you do write, it would be forcing your ideas on students. Instead, you need to promote healthy discussions. To follow my method, I used to close the windows and doors of my class. Imagine how much trouble that must have caused,\" laughs the actor, adding, \"I guess the management wanted to throw me out, but to make it look better, I quit before that.\"\nVascodigama's core theme explores how our education system is so academics-driven that it does not allow youngsters to figure out and follow their interests. \"The hope is that the film will get people to start a dialogue about bringing in a change. We want youngsters to understand that whatever they do, they have to do it out of passion, and not out of compulsion, which is also the tagline of the film,\" says Kishore.\nDespite the heavy subject, the film is an entertainer. \"Any film with a socially-relevant subject makes sense only if it reaches the audience, and comedy is one of the most popular formats these days. Much of the film actually revolves around my character and his love story. The rest just falls into place during his time on campus,\" explains Kishore, who is paired with Parvathy Nair in the film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:06:08.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
