The publication claimed that the \" Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" star had planned to lose her baby weight to grace the cover of the final nude issue of the magazine. As previously reported, Playboy will stop publishing images of nude women beginning in March next year. For that reason, Kim was reportedly \"hoping to commemorate the era by being the last ever person to pose naked for the magazine.\" The website quoted a so-called source as saying, \"Kim has already talked to Kanye [West] about losing her baby weight as part of her New Year's resolution and wants to be the last person to ever pose nude in Playboy.\" On another article, HollywoodLife went on claiming that Kris Jenner agreed with Kim's idea of being the last nude model of the magazine. \"Kris likes Kim's idea of being on the last nude Playboy issue, but likes the idea of having all the girls on the cover and inside pictorials as a better idea,\" another insider told the website. The so-called \"insider\" continued, \"[Kris] would love to see Kim, Kendall [Jenner], Kylie [Jenner], Khloe [Kardashian] and Kourtney Kardashian and herself do it. And she also thinks that if Caitlyn [Jenner] wanted to do it by all means, she should join in the fun as well.\" A rep for Kim told Gossip Cop that the report claiming that she wanted to be the last nude model of the magazine was completely \"false.\" Playboy insider also said that the report was \"pure fantasy\" and \"untrue.\" Given that the first report was false, the report about Kris agreeing with Kim's idea was consequently false too. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:11:18.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
