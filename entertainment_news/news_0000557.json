Arriving online on Wednesday, September 30, the dreamy visuals which was mostly shot in black and white finds the singer lounging in a beach chair as some shirtless boys are playing basketball. She puts on her flower headphones and drinks from an umbrella straw while clips of the boys are projected onto the wall behind her. In another scene, Del Rey and some girls jump into a pool and dance around underwater. \"Music to Watch Boys to\" was co-written by Del Rey and Rick Boyles who previously worked with her on her hit \"Summertime Sadness\". When premiering it on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show earlier this month, the 30-year-old songbird called the song one of her favorites from her LP. The \"Honeymoon\" album, meanwhile, recently debuted at No. 2 on Billboard 200 with 116,000 equivalent units. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:18:15.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
