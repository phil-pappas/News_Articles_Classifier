It comes as streaming services like Hulu, Pandora, Spotify and TuneIn offer ad-free as a paid option. \nThe plan includes exclusive access to new videos launching next year, as well as the YouTube Music Key service for music videos. It also comes with features such as the ability to download videos to mobile devices and have music playing in the background while using other mobile apps.
