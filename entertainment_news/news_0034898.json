I haven't been on a Booker Prize shortlist for 20 years, so those days are gone.\"\nAuthors who were on the long list but failed to be shortlisted included Marilynne Robinson and Anne Enright.\nThe Man Booker Prize was previously open only to authors from Britain, Ireland, the Commonwealth and Zimbabwe but this is the second year it has been open to all nationalities.\nArts & Entertainment Books & Publishing Booker Prize", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:47:51.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
