He previously worked as the museum's executive director of collection strategies and information, as well as the director of its European Art Department. \nSalort-Pons signed a five-year contract and will be paid a $375,000 base salary in his first year. He'll be given graduated raises each year, bringing his salary to $475,000 in 2020, the final year of the deal. \nHe succeeds Graham W. J. Beal, who retired as director in June. Beal helped to protect the museum's collection from possible sale during the city's bankruptcy and spearheaded a $158 million overhaul of the cultural attraction.
