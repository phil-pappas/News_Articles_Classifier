This never happened said witness! YouTube screen shot Chris Christie was painted as a rude train passenger over the weekend when sitting in the quiet car and using his phone on a train coming out of the nation's capitol. News outlets had Christie “screaming” and “yelling” over the phone along with him creating a “clamor” on Sunday morning after hopping on the D.C. Amtrak train headed for New York.\nAccording to “Fox and Friends” on Monday morning October 26, Christie came off looking rude, but what was reported “never happened,” claims Steve Doocy. Yes, Christie got on the train and sat in the first car that had an opening and that happened to be the quiet car. Christie was unaware that he sat in this sacred quiet car and he started to make phone calls.\nThis buzz started when an Amtrak passenger named Alexander Man got a hold of The Gawker and told them that Christie was told to stop talking on his phone or leave the train car. Mann described Christie’s behavior almost like someone would describe a tyrant, reporting that Christie was yelling at his secret service agents. He said:\n[Christie] “He got on last minute yelling at his two secret service agents I think because of a seat mix-up, sat down and immediately started making phone calls on the quiet car. After about 10 minutes the conductor asked him to stop or go to another car. He got up and walked out again yelling at his secret service.\"\nThe Gothamist calls this \"the money Quote: \" in their article that was published Sunday. This is what hooked in all the news reports. With Quote: s about Christie saying that he was \"yelling at his two secret service agents\" and with the Quote: conveying that the \"conductor asked him to stop or go to another car,\" there's some headlines in there!\nMann not only reported that Christie was on the phone, he also reported what he was saying over the phone. Mann said he heard Christie say: “This is frickin ridiculous” and “Seriously?! Seriously?!”\nLater in the day after the “Christie kicked out of Amtrak quiet car” and “Asked to leave Amtrak’s quiet car for creating a clamor” started to saturate the headlines, Christie’s camp issued an apology. That apology came via his spokesperson Samantha Smith who said:\n\"On a very full train this morning, the Governor accidentally took a seat in Amtrak’s notorious quiet car. After breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the Governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car.\" Smith went on to say, \"Sincere apologies to all the patrons of the quiet car that were offended.\"\nReports have the conductor coming up to Christie threatening to kick him out of the train car, but a witness nearby said that never happened. Katie Klabusich was a passenger sitting at the same table with Christie when the over-blown incident took place.\nKlabusich tweeted her version of the incident, which was almost the opposite of what was said by the witness who started all this buzz about Christie. She started off by saying she was no fan of Christie, but what is being reported just didn't happen. \"Fox and Friends\" read Klabusich's version of the ordeal live on-air Monday morning.\nKlabusich said that the conductor was checking tickets and simply reminded Christie that “this is the quiet car.” Christie was apologetic to the conductor, who was very polite to Christie. The conductor didn’t threaten to “kick him out” of the train car, as previously reported. Christie then told whoever was on the other end of the phone that he had to call him back and hung up the phone. He then moved into another car to finish his business.\nApparently Christie made a very honest mistake by sitting in the quiet car and talking, not screaming, over his phone. When the mistake was realized by the Governor he simply moved to another car.", "external_links": ["http://gawker.com/chris-christie-sipping-a-smoothie-was-kicked-off-an-a-1738543549?rev=1445786383092&utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_twitter&utm_source=gawker_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow", "http://gothamist.com/2015/10/25/chris_christie_allegedly_kicked_off.php"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:26:48.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
