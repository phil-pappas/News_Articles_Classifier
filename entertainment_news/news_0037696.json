In a recent interview with ET Canada, the awards-winning singer said that cheating wasn't the cause of his breakup with Emily. \"Emily is a beautiful and loving person, and I'm grateful for the time I had with her, for the relationship,\" Buble told host Erin Cebula. \"Without it, I wouldn't have had a chance to fall in love with myself enough to be with a woman like my wife. It didn't end because of cheating.\" Michael didn't give details about what caused their breakup but he simply said that they were just not meant for each other. \"It ended because we weren't right for each other, and we are now exactly where we're supposed to be in our lives,\" he explained. The cheating rumors surrounding Michael and Emily's relationship were reignited last month when the actress made an appearance on \"Howard Stern Show\". When host Howard Stern asked her if Michael was unfaithful, the British beauty said, \"I don't know, it's complicated. I never want to talk about it. I can't do it.\" The 40-year-old singer and Emily broke up in 2008 after 3 years of dating. The two have since moved on. Emily married actor John Krasinski in 2010 and they have a daughter together. Michael, meanwhile, married Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato in 2011 and they are currently expecting their second child . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:45:12.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
