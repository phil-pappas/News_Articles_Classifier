Photo: Cameron Spencer \nAt its peak, a whopping 4.4 million people tuned in to the NRL grand final between the Brisbane Broncos and North Queensland Cowboys on Sunday night - a new record for the league.\nAdvertisement The figure is almost half a million higher than Saturday afternoon's clash between the West Coast Eagles and Hawthorn which peaked at 3.9 million.\nThe average ratings for the two games were a lot closer however, as the AFL match-up averaged 3.5 million viewers compared to the NRL's 3.6 million.\nHawks celebrate winning the 2015 grand final.

Photo: Scott Barbour \nWhile the AFL continued its bemoaned tradition of importing musicians - hiring Chris Isaak, British singer Ellie Goulding and Bryan Adams - it was the NRL's local performances which won plaudits .\nAs Goulding had to defend herself against claims of lip syncing following an erroneously-timed backing track, over at Olympic Park, Jimmy Barnes, Cold Chisel and Jessica Mauboy exceeded expectations.\nThe 2015 AFL grand final ratings were down from last year, where a peak of 4.2 million people tuned in to watch Hawthorn thump Sydney.\nJimmy Barnes of Cold Chisel performs ahead of the 2015 NRL Grand Final match between the Brisbane Broncos and the North Queensland Cowboys.
