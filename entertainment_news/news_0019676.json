Photo: Channel Seven \nSigrid Thornton says she would have leapt at the chance to play Judy Garland \"even if she only came on and sneezed\". She rates playing Garland in Peter Allen: Not The Boy Next Door as one of her three favourite roles in a career that has lasted 43 years.\nThornton was already an expert on Garland's tortured life when Channel Seven offered her the part in the miniseries that starts next Sunday.\nShe knew, for example, that Garland helped launch Peter Allen's career in the United States, and encouraged the marriage between him and her daughter Liza Minnelli​ in 1967 (which ended in 1974 after Minnelli discovered he was gay). What Thornton needed to know was how Garland behaved during that period, when her health was declining through the effects of drugs and alcohol.\nSigrid Thornton, here with William McInnes, says her character Laura in Seachange was an opportunity to reinvent herself as a screen actor. Photo: Supplied \n\"My father was a lifelong Garland fan – he probably passed it on to me,\" she says.\nAdvertisement \"I just immersed myself in whatever ways I could, by reading and watching and listening. There have been a great number of books written about her.\n\"There were a couple of seasons of a television show she did late in her career, with live interviews where she was the interviewer. That was an interesting way to observe some of her behaviours.\"\nJoel Jackson plays the title character in the miniseries Peter Allen: Not The Boy Next Door . Photo: Channel Seven \nThornton had to become left-handed and put in brown contact lenses: \"Judy's large brown eyes really do sparkle, and being able to look at myself in the mirror with brown eyes gave me another way of getting into Judy's skin.\"\nPlaying a diva such as Garland can be a risky business for an actress. Garland lived in an era when movies and stars were melodramatic. Modern audiences are used to more restrained performances.\nThere might be a temptation to go over the top, and end up looking hysterical. Did Thornton feel the need to pull herself back, to be more restrained?\nSigrid Thornton as Jessica in The Man From Snowy River : 'It was a major breakthrough point in my career.' Photo: Supplied \nThornton chuckles. \"No, no, it's not a restrained performance. I don't think anyone would describe what I'm doing as restrained.\n\"She was utterly unrestrained. She wore her heart on her sleeve, Judy. There were some interviews where one is so touched by her openness. On the other hand, she was an inveterate liar. She was a raconteur. She would tell fantastic stories in order to make people happy.\n\"In one aspect of her character she was aware of her unique gift, but in another way she was never able to be satisfied that she was good enough.\n\"There was never really enough admiration for her, and this is not an unusual syndrome for actors. She was extremely intelligent, and operated on a very high frequency of intelligence and emotion and sensitivity.\n\"She could be very, very difficult to deal with professionally, but her actual baseline nature was tremendously optimistic.\"\nGarland was in the public eye for 40 years, just as Thornton has been. Does Thornton relate to that kind of pressure?\n\"Judy had a really different level of fame, but I understand it to a certain extent.\n\"I'm fortunate that it hasn't handicapped me greatly. I think it would be extremely challenging to be followed down the street at every turn. Loss of privacy is a big deal for anybody.\n\"I've tried not to expose certain parts of myself, and that runs to my family. I've worked hard to keep my nearest and dearest who have not chosen a public life out of the public life.\n\"Judy lived in a different time. There was a great deal of moulding and shaping of the public persona of the stars. They allowed people into their private world.\n\"She would have said she had a great life and a lucky life. She would say, I've had three wonderful children, I've been loved by extraordinary men, I've had a career to die for. Which she literally did.\"\nAt what point did Garland realise Peter Allen was gay?\n\"I think that's not really clear. Judy was attracted to numbers of gay men in her life. The common knowledge these days is that her father was, in fact, gay but people back then had double lives.\n\"Judy married a couple of gay men, so she was attracted to the exuberant humour, sensitivity and talent of Peter.\n\"The great advantage with telling this story now is we've come a long way – we're very close to legalising same-sex marriage.\n\"These kind of things have only been spoken about positively in the public arena very recently. We have the luxury of telling Peter's story in a more straightforward and honest way than would have been possible in his lifetime.\"\nPeter Allen: Not The Boy Next Door starts next Sunday, September 13, at 8.30pm on Seven. \nA life on screens When this column sent Sigrid Thornton a list of the major roles she's played since her first professional performance (in Homicide , at the age of 13), and asked her to rank her 10 favourites, she says she was \"very touched … It was so funny receiving that, because you put these things behind you when you're moving on to the next thing in life\".\nThen she got down to business and produced the top 10 list across the top of this page. She says it is \"in no particular order\", except that the equal top three had to be Laura Gibson, Judy Garland and Blanche Dubois (whom she played on stage last year).\n\"Laura was an opportunity to reinvent myself as an actor on the screen. I played her over a number of years and Seachange became part of the zeitgeist.\n\"I had enormous fun playing Judy Garland, but over a short period of time. It was like a beautiful flash. I so admire all the creatives involved in this project.\n\"I can't see a weak link in any of the performances. I had a lovely time watching them when I wasn't working. And I got to chat with my old friend Rebecca Gibney [who plays Peter Allen's mother].\n\"And Blanche in Streetcar is one of the greatest roles in the female canon. It was an extraordinary experience, even though it was like going to war every night.\n\"I want to say Amelia from Paradise , because that was made in America and it was an opportunity to live and work in another country and culture, with a young family.\n\"It was the longest running series role I'd ever taken on. American series work is really hard slog, really long hours. I learned a great deal about the craft.\n\"Bridget in Great Expectations was a favourite because I got to work with my husband [Tom Burstall], who wrote it, and my late father-in-law [Tim Burstall], who directed it. I'd have to include Angela in Snapshot , not because it was the greatest film in the world, but because it was my first lead in a feature.\n\"Jessica in The Man From Snowy River was a major breakthrough point in my career, and Philadelphia in All The Rivers came along very soon after I'd played Jessica.\n\"She was strong-willed, probably a feminist of her time, really. Plus I was working opposite the wonderful John Waters and working in beautiful Echuca for five months.\"\nCalm before the storm The producers of the latest season of The Block promised it would be \"back to basics\", with more emphasis on actual renovation and less on the bitchy competitiveness that has disturbed some viewers of recent seasons. Did it seem that way to the contestants?\nFor the most part yes, say Whitney and Andrew, whom Channel Nine has dubbed \"the love children\" because they'd met on the online dating service Tinder only months before they had to create a flat in Melbourne's landmark Octagon building.\nBut as our conversation progressed, it became apparent that sweetness and light had not always prevailed between the teams.\nQuestion: Was there any conflict between the contestants? Andrew: Dealing with that building shape is just a nightmare. I think when you're put under this extreme circumstance, there might be some confrontation, because we were complete strangers. But we did constantly hear that this Block group got on better than any in the past. So that's nice to know.\nQ: I'm looking at these photos Channel Nine sent out, and I have to say Suellen and Yvonne look pretty tough, like the desperate housewives of the Gold Coast. They look like they are set up to be the argumentative ones. \nWhitney: You've hit the nail on the head right there. I had a bit of a blowup with Suzi.\nAndrew: Everything that you can see in those photos came true.\nQ: So were they cast in the role of those twin sisters who were so tough in The Block a few seasons ago? \nAndrew: Yeah, but at least those twin sisters seemed a bit more relatable and down to earth than her.\nWhitney: At least they had a little bit of class about them. To be honest, I got on with Voni quite well. It was just Suzi. We're just from different worlds, different generations and different morals, I guess. It was in week five that something happened, and it was just blown out of proportion, and things were taken the wrong way. There's no hard feelings there. People are pushed to their limits in this show and things can annoy you. We just kind of spoke our minds when it did happen.\"\nQ We'll look forward to that. And how did you two work together? \nWhitney: I think we went really well together considering it was such a new relationship. It definitely made us stronger. If you can get through something like this, which is the hardest thing either of us have ever done, we bickered here and there, but every single couple had their moments. I think it was the next step in our relationship and we're glad we did it.\"\nAll the renovating is done. The flats are awaiting inspection by potential buyers, and the contestants are waiting for the auction. And regardless of what money they might make, Whitney says, \"we've learnt so much about each other. We hope we can run a little business together.\"\nThe Block starts on Sunday, September 6, at 7pm on Channel Nine. \nFor more, go to smh.com.au/entertainment/blog/the-tribal-mind .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:38:44.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
