Comment 0 Subscribe to Newsletter! \nIt was something eventually seen to happen and finally it has – Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom will remain married. \nAfter the dramatic turn of events that went as far as possibly seeing Odom lose his life, Khloe showed her true feelings towards the ex-NBA cager ever since he was reported and found virtually lifeless at a brothel in Las Vegas last October 13. Like Us on Facebook \nKhloe was among the first people to rush to Lamar’s side and she never left him until now. With that in play, it was obvious that she still held feeling for Lamar Odom despite the two filing for divorce back in 2013. \nSpeaking of which, all papers and talk about that celebrated divorce are now inexistent. \nThis comes after a report from TMZ revealing that Khloe’s lawyer, Laura Wasser, had asked a judge regarding the withdrawal of the divorce papers which both had previously signed \nThe file was in a pile, waiting in line to be processed and signed by a judge. The judge eventually granted the request and the divorce is no more. \nThis development hardly comes as a surprise ever since Khloe vowed to be by Lamar’s side through therapy. Doctors say that it could take months to possibly even years for Lamar to somehow get back to a normal life. Heavily justifying that was the fact that Khloe never left Lamar ever since the cager was hospitalized. \nKhloe and Kris Jenner even led the transfer of Lamar to Los Angeles so that he could be checked out by specialist for deeper evaluation. It is believed that Odom could be paying the price of that unfortunate episode that led to his mild stroke, including the possibility of needing a kidney transplant. \nWith the divorce off, it could probably signal the end of that celebrated fling that Khloe had with Houston Rockets basketball star James Harden. \nIt wasn’t too long ago that both were spotted on numerous occasions, including that celebrate Adidas deal which Khloe obviously supported. \nBefore word of the divorce being called off, Khloe had already put their relationship on hold. And now with Khloe's latest move on saving their marriage, Harden may have to move on from their fling. \nIndeed Harden may have been caught off-guard by the turn of events but it remains that the two were still married in the first place.
