Bruce Rauner among them, gathered in Kane County on Sunday to ride in the summerlike weather and raise money to help needy families.\nThe 29th annual DuKane ABATE Toy and Food Run began at Knuckleheads Tavern in Elburn and traveled a route that ultimately led them to a post-ride party in Batavia.\n\"Riding is so much fun, it is freedom and celebration of America,\" said Rauner, an avid motorcyclist. \"The riders are fantastic.\"\nParticipants in the ride each made a $10 donation, plus brought an unwrapped new toy and a nonperishable food item. The items collected are distributed to food banks, shelters, foster homes and social service agencies in DuPage and Kane counties.\nABATE of Illinois is a motorcycle safety and rights organization that aims to protects motorcyclists and raise awareness in the community through speaking engagements, education and visits to clubs and organizations.
