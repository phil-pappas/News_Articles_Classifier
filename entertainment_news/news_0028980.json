(AP) â€” A judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a woman who accuses Bill Cosby of molesting her at the Playboy Mansion in the 1970s when she was 15. \nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan ruled Wednesday that Judy Huth's lawsuit against Cosby should be allowed to proceed over the objections of Cosby's attorneys. \nLawyers for the 78-year-old comedian sought to dismiss Huth's lawsuit because her previous attorney failed to follow rules for how older sex abuse cases should be handled. \nCosby's attorney, Martin Singer, sought to dismiss the case because Huth's attorney named Cosby in the lawsuit when he shouldn't have been identified. \nHuth sued Cosby in December 2014, claiming the comedian forced her to perform a sex act around 1974 when she was underage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:29:23.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
