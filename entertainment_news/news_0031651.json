Following the success of their \" Cheek to Cheek \", the pair are now readying a follow-up which has been confirmed will feature their take on Cole Porter's classics. Bennett himself revealed the new project with GaGa and shared its details in an interview with Vulture. \"Yeah, we're doing an album,\" he said. \"It's going to be all Cole Porter songs. He was the best writer of all of them in the Great American Songbook. Highly intelligent. We're going to have a lot of fun doing that.\" \"Cheek to Cheek\" is a covers album of popular jazz standards like \"Anything Goes\" and \"Let's Face the Music and Dance\". The collection landed at No. 1 on Billboard 200 following its release last year. Bennett told Vulture that the album was a mutually beneficial project for him and GaGa. \"GaGa is a gorgeous singer, and when she sings a great ballad, I get goose bumps. She helped me and I helped her by doing 'Cheek to Cheek'. Through her telling her audience how much she likes me, all of them became fans of mine, all these young teenagers,\" he admitted. \"On the other hand, by her singing these beautiful songs on the album, the audience I have, all of them said, 'God, I never knew she sang that wonderfully.' So we both helped one another,\" he continued. \"We get along great. She's got a lot of talent. I think someday she's going to be very big in films, which I'm not too interested in. I work live, to audiences, but I think she's going to surprise everybody and make some good films.\" There's, however, still no word on when the \"Cheek to Cheek\" follow-up will arrive. GaGa appears to have started working on her solo effort, her first since 2013's \" ARTPOP \", and has been busy with her stint on \" American Horror Story : Hotel\", which Bennett said in the interview he hadn't seen yet. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:56:07.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
