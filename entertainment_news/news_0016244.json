About half of Americans (46%) have either been a victim of identity theft or know someone who was, up 12 percentage points from 2008. One in five Americans is not at all worried about having their identity stolen. 30-49 year-olds are the most nervous about identity theft, while millennials (18-29 year-olds) are the least concerned.\nMany Americans aren't taking the necessary precautions to protect themselves from identity theft. 42% don't check their credit reports regularly and 41% conduct banking and other sensitive business on unsecured Wi-Fi networks that do not require a password.\n\"With news of a data hack nearly every week, consumers are doing themselves a disservice by not checking their credit reports regularly,\" said Bankrate.com analyst Janna Herron . \"It's one of the easiest and most important steps to take and is free on sites like myBankrate.com.\"\nIn addition to free credit reports and scores (updated monthly), myBankrate.com also offers identity theft insurance worth up to $1 million .
