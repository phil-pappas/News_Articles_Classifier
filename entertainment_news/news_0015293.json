Botha. It later transpired that she did not say this, but that she had posted a link to an article that said it.\nIt seems to me that the furore that followed was a bit of an over-reaction, and a failure to understand how social media work.\nI quite often post links to articles that I think other people might find interesting, even if I disagree with some of the content. I sometimes post links to such articles hoping to see how other people respond before commenting on them myself. Posting a link to an article is not necessarily an endorsement of the content.\nI don't know Dianne Kohler Barnard, and I'm not a supporter of the DA -- I would never consider voting for them after their \"fight back\" campaign against democracy in 1999. But fair's fair, and I think the treatment of Kohler Barnard isn't fair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:57.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
