As you prepare for the spookiest night of the year, the ASPCA recommends taking some common sense precautions this Halloween to keep you and your pet safe.\n1. No tricks, no treats. That bowl of candy is for trick-or-treaters, not for Scruffy and Fluffy. Chocolate in all forms — especially dark or baking chocolate — can be very dangerous for dogs and cats. Candies containing the artificial sweetener xylitol can also cause problems. If you suspect your pet has ingested something toxic, please call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at 888-426-4435.\n2. Popular Halloween plants such as pumpkins and decorative corn are considered to be relatively nontoxic, but they still can produce unpleasant stomach upsets.\n3. Wires and cords from electric lights and other decorations should be kept out of reach of your pets. If chewed, your pet might suffer cuts, burns or even a life-threatening electrical shock.\n4. A carved pumpkin certainly is festive, but do exercise caution if you choose to add a candle. Pets can easily knock a lit pumpkin over and cause a fire. Curious kittens especially run the risk of getting burned or singed by candle flames.\n5. Please don’t put your dog or cat in a costume unless you know he or she loves it (yup, a few pets are real hams!). For pets who prefer their “birthday suits,” wearing a costume may cause undue stress.\n6. If you do dress up your pet, make sure the costume isn’t annoying or unsafe. It should not constrict movement or hearing, or impede his ability to breathe, bark or meow. Also, be sure to try on costumes before the big night. If your pet seems distressed, allergic or shows abnormal behavior, consider letting him go au naturale or donning a festive bandana.\n7. All but the most social dogs and cats should be kept in a separate room away from the front door during peak trick-or-treating hours. Too many strangers can be scary and stressful for pets.\n8. When opening the door for trick-or-treaters, take extra care that your cat or dog doesn’t dart outside. Always make sure your dog or cat has proper identification. Should your pet escape, a collar with an ID tag with your phone number as well as a microchip can be a lifesaver and increase the chances that he/she will be returned to you.\nIn Savannah, Halloween means Wag-O-Ween which takes place Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. Wrist bands and maps are available for $5/person today at Canine Palace or tomorrow at Armstrong House (on Bull Street at the Gaston Street side of Forsyth Park) where the trick-or-treat trekking begins. The event has more than 90 participating businesses. HSGS will again be hosting a pet costume photo contest with prizes in three categories.
