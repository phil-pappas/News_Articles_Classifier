Pic/ Santa Banta \n\"I feel privileged to be a part of the film. I have been a huge fan of Salman Khan for a long time. I was a bit nervous ... It was intimidating for me to be on the sets but I was excited as well.\n\"After a few days I got comfortable as Sooraj sir gave me lot of love. I cherish it. I had an amazing experience,\"\nSonam told reporters during the launch of first trailer of the film.\nRecalling her first meeting with the \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" star Sonam, 30, said the 49-year-old actor was generous enough to sit and talk to her.\n\"I was 14 when my dad (Anil Kapoor) and Salman were working together in a film. I was never allowed on a film set but for this movie I requested my dad to take me there.\nSalman sat with me for an hour and I think I would have traumatised him,\" she said.\nThe \"Raanjhanaa\" actress, who will be seen donning a traditional look in the film, says working with Barjatya was a\ngreat experience.\n\"Nobody loses temper on Sooraj Barjatya's film set. I have worked with him in an advert and he is completely\ndifferent. We all worked hard and it was a great experience,\" she said.
