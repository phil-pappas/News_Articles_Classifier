Da Vinci's Demons \nThird and final season debut \nLeonardo da Vinci (Tom Riley) sees his personal inventions being utilized as weapons by Ottoman invaders during the battle of Otranto. The plans for those inventions were stolen by someone he trusted. A modern equivalent would be having a member of your entourage leaking the best tracks from your new album. \nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 24 on Super Channel \n2. Hemlock Grove \nThird and final season debut \nAs the town’s grim secrets unravel, Olivia (Famke Janssen), Roman (Bill Skarsgard), Peter (Landon Liboiron) and Shelley (Madeleine Martin) are introduced to mysterious newcomers. Eventually Peter and Roman learn that to prevent the \"end of days,\" they'll need to release their true inner monsters. Sounds painful. \nWhen: Friday, Oct. 23 on Netflix \n3. Bob's Burgers \nGetting the jump on Halloween programming, the Belchers visit an allegedly haunted house after Louise (voice of Kristen Schaal) reveals that she never has been scared before and would like to give it a try. But as often is the case in these situations, things turn out to be a little more terrifying than anyone thought. \nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 18 on Fox, City \n4. Hunting Hitler \nDebut \nIn early 2014, the FBI declassified hundreds of documents suggesting the possibility that Adolf Hitler may have survived World War II and fled to South America after the fall of Nazi Germany. Veteran investigators subsequently reopened the “ultimate cold case,” and this eight-part series follows their progress. \nWhen: Tuesday, Oct. 20 on History \n5. Fargo \nIf you saw the debut of season two last week, you know that some shocking events already have taken place. The Gerhardt crime family – which is a literal family – finds itself in the midst of an internal power struggle, while young couple Ed (Jesse Plemons) and Peggy (Kirsten Dunst) try to clean up a mess. \nWhen: Monday, Oct. 19 on FX \n6. Belief \nDebut \nThis new documentary event series narrated by Oprah Winfrey will air on seven consecutive nights. In the first episode, an evangelical teen reconnects with her faith, an Indian-American woman begins her spiritual journey, a Jewish boy is initiated into adulthood and an Aboriginal elder passes on ancient wisdom. \nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 18 on OWN \n7. Tornado Hunters \nDebut (as a series), back-to-back episodes \nPicking up from last year's pilot broadcast, Greg Johnson, Chris Chittick and Ricky Forbes are loading up their storm truck, Flash, with new camera gear to help capture more extreme weather imagery than ever before. Um, couldn't these guys just try to hurt each other with silly stunts on YouTube like everyone else? \nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 18 on CMT \n8. The Grinder \nStewart (Fred Savage) and Deb (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) fear that certain people are trying to befriend them merely because of Stewart's famous brother Dean (Rob Lowe). On the flip side, Dean is fascinated by Claire (Natalie Morales), who is the only person he ever has met who is completely unimpressed by his celebrity status. \nWhen: Tuesday, Oct. 21 on Fox and City \n9. The Middle \nOne of my favourite returning characters on this sitcom is Reverend TimTom (Paul Hipp), who always has a song in his heart, whether you want to hear it or not. He returns to the fray when Frankie (Patricia Heaton) becomes worried about Mike (Neil Flynn), who is being even more quiet and distant than usual. \nWhen: Wednesday, Oct. 21 on ABC; Friday, Oct. 23 on City \n10. The Blacklist \nRed (James Spader) and Liz (Megan Boone) continue their mission to clear Liz's name. Red enlists the help of the task force to find a mysterious woman known as \"The Djinn\" who specializes in fulfilling revenge fantasies. Not that there would be much call for that in society, right? Sarcasm, in case you missed it. \nWhen: Thursday, Oct. 22 on NBC, Global", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:52:08.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
