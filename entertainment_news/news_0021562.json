It's the only pair of jeans I really love. They fit perfectly.\nBut I have been informed that I will not permitted out of the house again if I am wearing those jeans because the family's humiliation is too aggravating to endure. Random people can see boxer patterns if they look close enough.\nI resist. It's my Boxer Rebellion.\nThere are threats about losing my right to eat at the dinner table. And worse.\nSo when I claim appreciation about the debate in Gary — along with other burgs in the area — to ban saggy pants and the attendant sneaky revelation of undies, I completely understand this conflict.\nFirst, I am an old white guy, so I completely understand the irresistible impulse of all OWG's to tell young black guys what they're allowed to wear or else we'll get really upset. Don't they know that we're empowered by religion, culture and our elderly Caucasian-ness to be in charge of them and control their wardrobes? It's for their own good. It's in the Constitution somewhere.\nACLU ready to pick up complaints of Gary 'saggy pants' plan Gregory Tejeda Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union in Indianapolis have their eye on Gary and the Common Council, waiting to see if they produce an ordinance regarding the wearing of pants sagging below one's waistline that warrants a legal challenge.\nThat idea has been the subject of discussion...\nOfficials with the American Civil Liberties Union in Indianapolis have their eye on Gary and the Common Council, waiting to see if they produce an ordinance regarding the wearing of pants sagging below one's waistline that warrants a legal challenge.\nThat idea has been the subject of discussion...\n(Gregory Tejeda) Of course, this deep control impulse is not the personal social property of all old white men. The role is so scripted that \"old white guys\" don't even have to be male or white or old. The saggy-pants wearers don't need to be black, either. It's a cultural state of mind.\nI suppose that old black guys have this control instinct, too, although I would have to be close friends with 100 or so old black men to form a valid statistical pool. Maybe old women of every race and age have the same views on saggies too.\nIt doesn't matter.\nThe \"Universal Social Police Force for Our Own Good\" is an equal opportunity employment agency. All you need is an overwhelming urge to tell other people what to do, or else.\nOver the years, this has inspired rules about hair length, clothes, language and politics. The teachers of my youth uniformly believed that anyone with long hair was a degenerate hippy plotting to ruin the world.\nBased on my educational experience, there was no OWG as harshly judgmental as an old white nun. Until much later in life, I never knew there was any other kind of nun than angry, old, white women dressed up in Benedictine burkas. Then nuns turned out to be real people with complex personalities. Who knew?\nQuickly: 'Doesn't Gary have issues more pressing than saggy pants?' What's Quickly?

If you do not tow the line with the extremist...\nRead the story But it seems clear enough that young men of color wearing their pants drooping below their waists aggravates old people who then pass laws to stop it. And get off my lawn!\nWe laughably call this civilization.\nEventually the process of passing legal prohibitions will transform every irritating habit into illegal conduct. Or more efficiently, we can confiscate every dollar a person ever produces as an automatic fine for irritating violations they might commit.\nBecause I love my old jeans with the hipster hole and do not wish to let them pass into the eternal darkness, that poses a problem for me. Which side do I support? Low-riding pants by black youths or tightly cinched, belted pants like OWG's wear?\nPersonally, I'd pass a law banning old white guys from wearing jeans with the belt where their waist used to be but hasn't been since Lyndon Johnson was president. Now their new waistlines are dirigibles with the belt cinched under the Goodyear banner.\nIf social good sense had worked to my benefit, someone would have stopped me from wearing so-puffy-they-made-you-hoot mutton chop sideburns and platform shoes that lifted me at least to 6-foot-4. Of course, if any old white guy had told me to cease wearing that tortured sartorial array in the 1970s, I would have liked the mutton chops, et al, even more.\nBefore you become an OWG you try to become anything but that.\nI have attempted to burn all photos of me from the 1970s but fear some may have survived. The blackmail letter could arrive any day.\nAs for low-riding jeans, foes might be overlooking a hidden benefit in their favor. The lower the jeans, the more clear the underwear. That proves the wearer does have boxers or briefs. My jeans with the hole prove the same about me.\nIt's a civilized, courteous announcement. If you fear low-drag disrespect, consider if this argument were about going commando being a protected civil right.\nNo one wants posterior cleavage, especially old white guys with the hole in our pants.\ndavid.rutter@live.com .\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune Opinion Lyndon B.
