The hotels are offering specials for those who book holiday parties early.\nReston, VA (PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nWith people wondering how fall came up so quickly, the Sheraton Reston Hotel and The Westin Reston Heights are giving them a reason to think about winter. The hotels are offering specials for those who book holiday parties early. The hotels are managed by Crescent Hotels & Resorts , an operator of over 100 hotels throughout North America, including 15 in the Washington, DC area.\n“We understand that holiday parties come in all shapes, sizes and budgets,” said Tim Bailey, General Manager for the Westin Reston Heights and the adjacent Sheraton Reston Hotel . “The Westin has become well known as the place to host intimate and upscale events.” The hotel’s award winning Vinifera Wine Bar & Bistro , known for its contemporary small plates menu and extensive wine options, offers a private dining room, featuring natural light with views overlooking the restaurant’s patio. This venue can host groups of 20 -100 guests.\nA sommelier is available to holiday party planners to make wine pairing suggestions for tailor made menus for groups. Bailey credits the popularity of the private dining room as a holiday venue based on its reputation among locals year round. “We have such a loyal following,” said Bailey, “that our regular guests usually suggest the restaurant to their company meeting planner for smaller corporate events such as meetings, retreats and holiday parties.”\nWhen looking for event space for larger holiday parties, planners find it to be a balancing act of rates, preferred dates and budget. “Being one of the larger ‘event space hotels’ in the area we have the flexibility to find the perfect size room for any group from 20 to 300,” said Bailey, referring to the Sheraton Reston Hotel. “We can also get creative with those planners on a tighter budget. Last year, many clients felt having their corporate holiday parties on a Wednesday or Thursday worked well. Not only did it allow them to save money, but the feedback from their associates was very positive as they were able to spend key weekend nights in the winter with their families. Another option is having a breakfast or lunch event rather than a dinner party.”\nThe Sheraton Reston Hotel is offering a special, allowing those planners that book their winter events by November 15, 2015 to receive the following perks:\nDouble Starwood Preferred Guest Points Overnight Stay for the Planner with Breakfast A Weekend Stay for Two with Breakfast Two Bottles of Wine Complimentary Hors d’Oeuvres with Pre-set Menus\nFor more information, or to check for space availability call 703-418-6800 or check online .\n“The addition of offering an overnight weekend stay and two bottles of wine was very well received last year,” said Bailey. “We suggested that planners give these as door prizes at the event or prior to the event in office drawings. It’s a great way to build excitement for their holiday party.” Both the Sheraton and The Westin offer “take the elevator home” room rates. These are discounted rates where party guests can plan to stay overnight and extend the celebration.\nAs fall gets into full swing and holiday decorations have already begun to fill the stores, people are saying, “I still have time to plan for our holiday party.” For many who opted to save their company money and secure the best holiday dates, they will be saying, “Holidays? I took care of that already.”\nABOUT THE SHERATON RESTON HOTEL AND THE WESTIN RESTON HEIGHTS\nTwo top-rated Reston hotels located just moments from all that Northern Virginia has to offer!
