His mission was to give local kids a sense of pride and something positive to do. He started with a ragtag bunch that got by with equipment bought at flea markets. Today, there are five Oakland Royals teams, for youth ages 7-15. \nWhy Royals? Because these kids, says Bryant, are \"future kings and queens.\" \nCorr, a Berkeley filmmaker whose late father coached baseball in Richmond, had vacationed in Cuba and witnessed the incredible benevolence of Reyes, who devotes much of his life to teaching baseball to children. Corr introduced the two coaches via videotape, and soon, Bryant vowed to take his kids to Cuba one day to meet Reyes' squad. Advertisement \nThe handsomely crafted film follows the Royals to Cuba, where, for one week, youngsters from two hardscrabble neighborhoods played together on and off the sandlots, formed genuine friendships and, in the words of Corr, \"achieved something beautiful.\" \nBut when the parent of one of the Oakland players was murdered back home, it served as yet another brutal reminder of the challenges that come with living in an American inner city. \nCorr's film draws comparisons between the difficulties facing low-income youths in Oakland and Havana but also points out a glaring difference: While the American households so often are missing one or both parents and the kids feel isolated, there is a true sense of community in Cuba, which cares for its kids \"impossibly well.\" \nDoors for Tuesday's event open at 6 p.m., and the film screens at 7 p.m. Secure complimentary tickets at gtth.eventbrite.com . Tickets will also be available at the venue.
