Her new album 360 (Degree) Woman REBIRTH shares that message from beginning to end, sharing with the listeners how her calling to music began at a young age, and today Ms. Maree is showing she has answered the call and is giving her all through each and every song.\nUsed by permission from Cheri Maree Though the album itself contains mostly original music, Cheri Maree pays tribute to one of her musical influences---the legendary Chaka Khan---in the single AIN'T NOBODY. \"I love Chaka Khan and appreciate the doors she has opened for so many women,\" she says. \"Her genius, her music and her style made it possible to do what I am doing today.\"\nOther standouts on the album are MIRROR! MIRROR!, MORE THAN ENOUGH and TIME TO SHINE, each of which reminds the listener to embrace who they are, realize their worth and don't be afraid to let their light shine.\nIn the video for the single TIME TO SHINE Ms. Maree speaks primarily to women about the need to love themselves for who they are, regardless of what the media and others might try to make them think about themselves.\nThe album is all about loving the skin you are in and realizing the gift that you are in the world.\n360 (Degree) Woman REBIRTH is available through Amazon .
