At the height of his powers, an established composer and successful conductor, his mature style speaks forcefully of his inner life in a way that resonates with emotions of his listeners. \nHis thoughts about the symphony, sketched out in one of his notebooks, call its sombre opening theme, \"Complete resignation before Fate, or … before the inscrutable predestination of Providence\". But the symphony’s heart is its gloriously romantic slow movement, with its famous horn solo. This lovesong, the graceful waltz that follows, and the fireworks of the last movement seem to defy gloomy Providence. \nIn the West we know little of the music of Khachaturian beyond the Violin Concerto made famous by Yehudi Menuhin, and the Adagio from his ballet Spartacus. But Khachaturian, himself a pianist, first attracted attention in the West with his piano concerto. Khachaturian drew on a wealth of inspiration from his childhood in Tbilisi, Georgia. \"Everybody sang: the artisan as he worked in his little yard… the street vendors selling Georgian sour milk, fruit and fish. Each vendor had an individual melody of his own, an expressive motif that I shall never forget. As evening fell, the courtyards were filled with songs and dance melodies, now gay and carefree, now tender and languid.\" \nThose impressions fill this concerto with fresh folkloric delight. New Zealand’s leading pianist, Michael Houstoun, returns to perform it with Orchestra Wellington. \nTo open the concert, Orchestra Wellington presents an overture by one of the Mighty Five, Balakirev, whose search for an authentically Russian voice was a seminal influence on the great composers who came after him. A colourful and energetic work, two of its melodies will seem familiar; Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky later made use of them. \n\"PROVIDENCE\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:59:33.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
