I had to drive to Philly last weekend to restock.\"\nThe Hero Board is similar to the Segway Human Transporter, a two-wheeled, self-balancing, battery-powered electric vehicle. The difference? Hero Boards don't have handles. You move forward and backward by shifting your balance very lightly on the board's pressure points.\n\"When you start, you definitely want a wall or shoulder to hang on to,\" Guida said. \"You'll get used to how sensitive the board is when it reacts to your movement. Within half an hour, you'll be a pro.\"\nHero Boards have five hours of battery life and react to sensor pads on the board where your toes and heels are placed. With the slightest pressure, you can glide forward, backward or spin around on a flat surface.\n» Which predictions did 'Back to the Future' get right about 2015?\n» Celebrate 'Back to the Future' Day in memes\n» CNY DeLorean owner loves car more than 'Back to the Future' movies\nOther than being able to glide over water, Guida says the Hero Board is just like the hoverboard in the \"Back to the Future\" films.\n\"You still feel like you're flying or floating when you're riding one,\" he said. \"This started with athletes showing up on these at basketball or football games, and news spread on YouTube. Right now, it's probably one of the hottest products out there.\nHero Boards in Destiny USA sell at two prices: $699 for a regular Hero Board and $799 for a larger Hero Board with a sound system, which can connect to your smart phone and blast music from built-in speakers.\nHero Board plastic is infused with aluminum to avoid cracks (if you crash into a wall, not that I did) and there's an independent motor on each wheel. They can cruise a little faster than 10 mph.\nSimilar products do exist, like the Wheeli Electric Balance Scooter , but prices differ regionally. Online, Wheeli Scooters range from $1,100-1,300.\nThe Hero Boards kiosk is located on the first level of Destiny USA by J.C. Penney.\nAs for a real, \"hovering\" hoverboard? Maybe it's not such a far-fetched idea.\nIthaca College physics and astronomy professor Matthew C. Sullivan says, \"We're probably closer to being able to create a transportation system that's levitating than we are to creating personal automobiles that can both fly and drive.\"\nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
