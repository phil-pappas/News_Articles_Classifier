Bush’s military service during the Vietnam War.\nAn Internet controversy erupted on the authenticity of documents in the broadcast, one that quickly spread to question the integrity of the broadcasters.\nCBS fired Mapes and abruptly ended Rather’s career.\n“What I love about the film, given that you’ve got a central female protagonist who is as passionate about her work as the male protagonist,” noted Cate Blanchett, 46, who plays the award-winning Mapes. “The film doesn’t justify the amount of time she spends with her child, the amount of time she spends at home and the amount of time she spends at work.\n“Nor, as a biopic would perhaps, does it dwell too much on what makes her tick. It’s about the crisis at hand.\n“Hopefully, I don’t think it asks for sympathy perhaps but understanding, which is quite different.”\nMapes’s 2005 memoir “Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power” is the basis for “Truth,” but she’s hardly a public figure, so did Blanchett depend on the woman herself to play her?\n“I’d seen this story when it broke, but I knew nothing of what happened subsequently. Reading the script was a real revelation to me, and then I did the usual thing: I Googled Mary Mapes and I looked at a lot of interviews she gave.”\nThey met in New York. “I sort of asked her inane questions and really didn’t talk. Then we Skyped.\n“But at a certain point in filming I had to stop talking to Mary because it’s not really a biopic, and the thrust of the story is such that it really existed between (Robert) Redford and myself.\n“You can do all the homework in the world, but it has to exist in the moment between two actors.”\nBlanchett, who critics have praised as an upcoming Oscar nominee, smiled. “So at the end, you just have to play what’s there.”\n— cinesteve@hotmail.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Blanchett+applauds+courage+of+%E2%80%9860+Minutes%E2%80%99+producer"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:33:11.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
