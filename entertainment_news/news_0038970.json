Photo: Jasmine Robertson \nMaureen Unasa, a Samoan-Australian artist who lives in Campbelltown, says the delicate shells which frame her face are the most important part of her headdress. \n\"It outlines the fragility behind being a warrior, or being someone that stands up or speaks out for something,\" she says of her creation. \nThe image, she hopes, is one of peaceful strength. \"You have the perception of a warrior being so fierce, but this is more about the strength that's within, and it arises out of a more peaceful place, of wanting a better world.\"\nSamoan-Australian Maureen Unasa's headdress and tapa dress. Photo: Jasmine Robertson \nUnasa is one of 13 women taking part in the Adorned: Women of Western Sydney project. Established by artist Liam Benson, the women made headdresses by hand at fortnightly workshops over six months. It is a celebration of the diversity in Western Sydney, with Afghani, Iranian and Maori just some of the cultures included. \nAdvertisement The women formed close bonds at the workshops. \"The experience was one of acceptance and understanding of where other women came from, their stories,\" Unasa says. \"It was amazing. I would use the word love, that's what we all felt.\"\nUnasa's headdress features woven pandanus leaves and her dress is a traditional tapa dress. She will wear the outfit alongside the other women and Benson in the parade at Parramasala on Friday.\nThe headdress created by Afghani Tamkin Hakim. Photo: Jasmine Robertson \nThe images will be exhibited at the Courtyard, Riverside Theatres, over the weekend, with workshops on Saturday and Sunday in Prince Alfred Square from noon. \nPhotographed by Jasmine Robertson, the powerful images are a tapestry of stories featuring family ornaments and traditional embroidery techniques and materials. The project has been set up through WeAve Parramatta, Parramatta Artists Studio and the Community Migrant Resource Centre.\nBenson says there were often tears as the workshops progressed; some of the women shared stories about having felt isolated and lonely, and how this project was the first time they had felt acknowledged and embraced in Australia. \n\"A lot of the time we spent talking about our identities, who we were and our relationship to Western Sydney and how we define ourselves. We talked about our cultural backgrounds and how we're all here sharing the space. Everyone was really able to talk about what made them tick. We talked about where we were raised and basically how it all feeds in to who we are now,\" Benson says.\nBenson says he hopes the women will continue to run the workshops, and is assessing the possibility of taking the project on a national tour.. \nAnasa says she hopes people find the exhibition empowering.  \n\"There's so much to do in the world, you can express yourself in other ways. That's what the women at Adorned did, express our thoughts and wear it on our heads, which is what Liam wanted us to capture â€“ what's in your head and get it out there, rather than having it tucked away deep inside.\"\nFor the full Parramasala program, see parramasala.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:54.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
