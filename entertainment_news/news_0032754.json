Since, August, the actress has been cantering under Jeetu's supervision for Vishal Bhardwaj's upcoming romance-drama, Rangoon.The film, which also features Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor, is a Casablanca-like love triangle set against the backdrop of the Second World War.\nJeetu, who had earlier trained Shahid for Vishal's 2009-thriller, Kaminey, where the actor was seen racing with a dozen white horses, recalls a call from Vishal informing him that he wanted him to turn Kangana into a champion horse rider.\"We have been practising the basics for two hours a day since August. Kangana shows up at 6 am sharp, whenever she is in the city. She is extremely particular about her saddle, boots and helmet. She is a quick learner, buzzing with questions about horse riding,\" he says.\nTwo days ago, Kangana took Paris by storm, looking chic in the front-row beside Rihanna, Elizabeth Olsen and Emilia Clarke at a fashion week at the Louvre. She will be completely deglam over the next two months. \"All her riding gear will be in shades of brown and she will be wearing paddock boots,\" says Jeetu, who played a swordsman in the Hollywood film, The Fall. \"It would be great to have Kangana gallop with a sword. At our first training session, she told me that this was the first time she would ride a horse in a film and she wants to be perfect. She wouldn't ride till she had her stance right. She has not started training for her stunts yet but she has started caring for the horses and they understand her now too.\"\nREAD: Kangana Ranaut: My character in 'Katti Batti' has been toughest\nJeetu's family has trained Bollywood actors for the last 40 years. They also supplied horses for Ramesh Sippy's Sholay, BR Chopra's Mahabharat and more recently, Madras Cafe and Action Jackson.\"There will be lots of horses and action sequences in Rangoon. Vishal knows exactly what he wants,\" says Jeetu, adding that the government and the Censor Board are keen to take horses off the streets and out of films. \"But I've assured the authorities that there will be no cruelty towards animals in my films,\" he adds.\nListen to songs of Kangana Ranaut on Gaana.com\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates, follow us on G + >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Kangana Ranaut's quirky fashion sense - TOI\nTanu Weds Manu Returns Amazon.in : INR 340.00 Buy now ", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/playlist/inhouse-dj-hits-of-kangana-ranaut", "http://www.amazon.in/Tanu-Weds-Returns-Kangana-Ranaut/dp/B01178W1P0%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB01178W1P0", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MseT57KSyJ0", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61u0Yv797SL._SL160_.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:47:54.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
