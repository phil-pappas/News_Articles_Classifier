Whether that is a family member, friend, or neighbor – death is bound to happen in life. It’s when death actually hits and the grief is overwhelming that individuals find it hard to maintain hope. James W. Meyer, author of “God Knew,” knows what it is like to lose people he cares about the most. Even though it meant making personal sacrifices and receiving ridicule about his decision, Meyer began to take care of his health-challenged parents on a full-time basis, all while growing his career in the financial world.\n“I took care of my parents during my adult years and actually had my parents living with me for years. I tried very hard to honor my parents and it was extremely painful for me when they passed,” Meyer said.\nShortly after his mother’s death, Meyer had a feeling deep inside that prompted him to write “God Knew” that not only shares of his own personal story, but shares encouragement to others who are experiencing what he did.\n“I’ve walked the walk on what I wrote in the book. I believe we need a resurgence of family values and faith in God to turn our country around. God continues to bless me and I am thankful for the life I have, even if it’s not exactly the one I planned for,” Meyer said.\nAfter reading “God Knew,” readers will grasp that God has a specific plan for their life and that relationships with God, family, and friends matter the most and will see you through the hard times in life.\nFor more information, visit http://www.godknewbook.com\n“God Knew”\nBy: James Meyer\nISBN: 978-1-49086-563-8\nAvailable in softcover, hardcover, e-book\nAvailable on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and WestBowPress\nAbout the author\nJames W.
