Related Content Which Sesame Street character are you? \nOne in 68 U.S. children has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2014 report by the CDC estimates that 1 in 42 boys has autism, 4.5 times as many as girls (1 in 189). \nThe Sesame Street and Autism: See All in Amazing Children program is available as an app and on desktop. It includes daily routine cards and resources to help family, friends and others who encounter children with autism. \nSesame Workshop partnered with 14 other organizations, including the Yale Child Study Center and Autism Speaks, on the initiative. \nIn the digital storybook, Elmo plays with Julia on the playground and helps his friend Abby Cadabby understand that Julia plays differently than them. Through his patience and understanding, he helps Abby understand Julia. \n\"Elmo's daddy told Elmo that Julia has autism,\" he says. \"So she does things a little differently. Sometimes Elmo talks to Julia using fewer words and says the same thing a few times.\" \nAs the group goes on a quest for a snack, Julia places her hand over her ears when inside Hooper's store. \n\"What's the matter?\" asks Abby. \n\"Julia has really good ears,\" explains Elmo. \n\"Sometimes she hears noises that Elmo doesn't notice. Like the noise the blender makes. She really doesn't like it!\" \nThe website also tells the story of the character Benny and the real-life stories of Nasaiah and Thomas. \nSesame Street is using #SeeAmazing to encourage people to share their stories, videos and pictures on social media to keep the conversation and network of support ongoing. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
