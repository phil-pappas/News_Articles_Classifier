The trio will be overseeing \"Dr. Dreary's Snakes: Museum of Rare Alice Cooper Group Artifacts\" — Dr. Dreary, Dunaway's nickname in the band, belies his congenial nature. \n\"We're bringing an unbelievable amount of rare, unseen artifacts,\" Dunaway said by phone. \"We've got our stage costumes, mannequins from the \"Billion Dollar Babies\" stage show and all kinds of original cool stuff.\" \nDunaway this year published his book, \"Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs!: My Adventures in the Alice Cooper Group.\" It will be available for purchase at the show. \nAlice Cooper and his band staged notorious theatrical concerts in the early 1970s that saw Cooper meet his fate in several gruesome ways, including the gallows, the guillotine and the electric chair. \n\"We always tried to up the ante onstage and the book is about how much fun we had doing it,\" said Dunaway. \"People loved the show or hated it, but no one walked out indifferent.\" \nDunaway said the theatrics wouldn't have mattered if not backed by a strong musical repertoire. The Alice Cooper Band performed many of Cooper's greatest hits between 1969 and 1973, including \"School's Out,\" \"I'm Eighteen,\" \"Under My Wheels,\" \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" and \"Billion Dollar Babies.\" Cooper went solo in the mid-1970s. \nThe band reunited with Cooper earlier this month for an impromptu performance at a Dallas bookstore following a Dunaway signing. \"When we get together the jokes just continue flowing,\" he said. \"We're all family.\" \nDunaway and Smith also appear on the new Hollywood Vampires album, a collection of covers by Cooper. The duo perform on a mash-up of \"School's Out\" and Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall (Part II).\" \nDunaway also plays with the band Blue Coupe, which includes members of Blue Oyster Cult. In addition, he is working on two musical projects. \n\"The first is a collection of avant-garde sound collages,\" he said. \"I'm also going to make the scariest album ever made. Alice says it's impossible to shock anyone anymore, but I've got some pretty creepy stuff lined up.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:19:00.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
