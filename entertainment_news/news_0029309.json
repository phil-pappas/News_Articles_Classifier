The company had previously said that the software was installed on cars with variants of the EA 189 diesel engine built to the “Euro 5″ emissions standard. (Also Read: German authorities to order recall of 2.4 million Volkswagen vehicles) Spokesman Pietro Zollino confirmed to the AP on Thursday a report from the dpa press agency that the company is now checking whether models with the EA 288 diesel motor built to the same emissions standard may also have the software. Newer cars built to the “Euro 6″ standard are said not to be affected. Zollino didn’t say how many cars are being checked. VW previously said 11 million cars worldwide were affected. \nModified Date: October 22, 2015 6:50 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:40:14.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
