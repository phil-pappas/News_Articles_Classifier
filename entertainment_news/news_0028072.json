The college kid who, during a spring-break trip to Tampa, hitchhiked to St. Petersburg just to see his beloved Cardinals play an exhibition game.\nThat was how deeply the Cubs manager once loved the Cardinals, adding another layer to the rivalry and creating a fun subplot in a National League Division Series starting Friday certain not to lack drama.\n\"I remember Joe Maddon the Cardinal fan, but he's not a Cardinal fan no more,'' Cassarella said Thursday from Hazleton. \"I asked him that earlier in the year. I said, 'I guess you're not going to stick for the Cardinals anymore.' He said, 'Heck with them.' He's not going to be fazed by being in St. Louis. He has a job to do.''\nCubs' Joe Maddon on growing up a Cardinals fan Cubs manager Joe Maddon talks about growing up a Cardinals fan and the competition in the NL Central.\nCubs manager Joe Maddon talks about growing up a Cardinals fan and the competition in the NL Central.\nSee more videos\nNo manager in the majors has done the job more skillfully this season than Maddon, who acknowledged feeling nostalgic during the Cubs’ workout Thursday at Busch Stadium.\nMaddon bragged that he walked past a photograph of the 1964 World Series champion Cardinals and recognized every player, including infielder Eddie Spiezio, a favorite. He beamed describing his friendship with Cardinals institutions Tim McCarver and Mike Shannon. He praised Branch Rickey and still considers Whitey Herzog a mentor, which shouldn’t be Cardinal sins even for the leader of the Cubs.\n\"I have a lot of respect for the organization, always have,'' Maddon said. \"But right now I'm a Cub and hopefully will be a Cub for a long time.''\nCubs fans are thinking infinity, the word Maddon introduced Wednesday night referring to Jake Arrieta's pitch count. As Cubs players sprayed champagne and smoked cigars in a raucous clubhouse after that rewarding 4-0 wild-card victory over the Pirates, Maddon sat in the interview room and savored the chance to manage against his favorite boyhood team in the playoffs. Ever so briefly, the most youthful 61-year-old in baseball felt like a kid again.\n\"That's pretty awesome, man,'' Maddon said. \"Beyond that, I don't want to make it personal. It's about the players.''\nSorry, but if the wild-card game was all about Arrieta, the NLDS will be all about Maddon, from the decisions he makes during games to the tone he sets between them. Every move Maddon has made lately with his versatile lineup has worked. Every message he has sent has resonated.\nIt often goes unnoticed how Maddon's quirky charisma keeps the focus on him and away from players, much like Ozzie Guillen did with the White Sox when they won the 2005 World Series. Nobody who spends more than five minutes around Maddon worries about the Cubs being too tight. They exude Maddon's confidence and bounce around with his exuberance. There are no baseball metrics to measure that.\nAfter beating the Pirates, for example, Maddon sounded more like a sports psychologist than a baseball manager in describing what makes the Cubs fearless, not to mention how he worked in entertaining references to Gibson, Roberto Clemente and Joe Namath.\nBack in Hazleton, Cassarella laughed hearing his lifelong friend compare Arrieta to \"Broadway Joe\" Namath. From Maddon, it marked the ultimate compliment.\n\"Joe loved Namath, and we called (Maddon) 'Broad Street Joe' because that was the main street in Hazleton and he was a damn good quarterback,'' Cassarella said of Maddon, who threw four touchdown passes in his final game for Lafayette College. \"Joe wore the flashy white spikes like Namath and everything. He quit after his freshman year at Lafayette because the baseball coach said, 'Your future's in baseball.' ''\nThe rest was history, something the Cubs believe they can make more of against the Cardinals, baseball's best team during the regular season. That record means nothing now, and Maddon, more than anyone, ensures the Cubs won't arrive intimidated or overwhelmed.\n\"This does feel like a beginning,'' Cubs President Theo Epstein admitted. \"We have a chance to win 11 more games and a World Series.''\nNobody snickered. Nobody rolled their eyes. Anybody who knows Maddon knows better than to doubt what the Cubs suddenly are capable of in the culture he created — especially those who have known him longest.\n\"You watch, Joe's going to take them to the World Series, if not this year, soon,'' Cassarella said. \"I'm proud of him, really proud. The only thing is, he has to shave that old, gray beard, that's all — but not till the season's over.''\nLooks like that might be awhile.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Joe Maddon St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs World Series Jake Arrieta Ozzie Guillen", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56171f23/turbine/ct-joe-maddon-cardinals-cubs-haugh-spt-1009-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56172934/turbine/ct-cubs-maddon-video-spt-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:05:39.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
