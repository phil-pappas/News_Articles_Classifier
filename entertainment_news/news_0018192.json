Contributed Local Real Estate Subscribe Now \nIT WAS 60 years ago that Johnny Cash walked in to the Memphis Recording Service building in Tennessee and cut his first single Hey Porter. \nGenerations later and 12 years after his death, his music is as strong as ever. \nCountry music singer Daniel Thompson has rejoined his bandmates for a fourth national tour showcasing the works of Johnny Cash and he says the crowds just can't get enough of the Man in Black. \n\"More than anything it's just being honest in his music. He was really trying to say something in a lot of his songs and I think people really relate to that,\" Thompson said. \"And it's not just one particular type of person that relates to it, it's a lot of different people on a lot of different levels. \n\"He was a very skilled artist in that way. \n\"He was able to speak to a lot of different types of people through the one song or the one album or just his music in general.\" \nThompson said he and his band The Tennessee Studs had worked hard to keep true to the original sound, playing with the same simple two guitar, bass and drums arrangements Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Three were known for. \n\"The arrangements were deceptively simple. When you get down to actually playing them, they are a little bit more tricky than people realise. \n\"On the surface it is simple, but there is a little more to it to get it right. \"That's what we're all about. \"We want to play these songs the way people want to hear them so we go to a lot of effort to get them right.\" \nThe new show 60 Years of Cash comes to the Ipswich Civic Centre on October 31. johnny cash", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:27:09.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
