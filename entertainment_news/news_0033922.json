Kurrent Music, a groundbreaking Collaborative Music Blog that innovates how they research, discover and document music.\nMiami, FL, September 27, 2015 --( PR.com )-- A father/son duo created a powerful web site that connects to music streaming data feeds such as Spotify™, Soundcloud™, YouTube™ and iTunes™ among others, to provide bloggers unparalleled research tools to write articles. The site curates data from established as well as upcoming artists resulting in a unique and amazing experience for music aficionados in all music genres.\nIn just 3 months since its release, Kurrent Music has amassed over 1000 articles, interviews, and reviews in different music genres such as indie, hip/hop, R&B and classical music featuring dozens of writers in more than 10 countries including US, UK, Canada, China, Mexico, Italy, Ghana, Serbia, Philippines and Venezuela.\n\"One of our goals is to provide rising artists a platform to expose their music; this can be achieved by letting real people blog about their music preferences and experiences at a local level and later connect them with world-renowned artists,\" explains Danny Garcia, who is currently studying Music Business and Production at the prestigious Clive Davis Institute of Recording Music at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. \"Kurrent Music is much more than news about the most popular artists out there; letting anyone express their thoughts and opinions on a Soundcloud track, an album, a music video, or even a concert results in a compelling way to discover new artists and their music, and a democratization of the 'music blog' as a whole.\"\nRene Garcia's small software firm, Software FX, Inc. based in Boca Raton FL, has been creating software components for developers for over twenty years; he offers a more technical perspective on Kurrent Music:\n\"At first, I was just helping Danny jumpstart his music blog in a popular blogging platform, but when I took a closer look at its limitations I realized there was a huge opportunity to leverage some of the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) available in the music industry to create an information mash and a whole music blogging technology platform around this data. The results are just amazing and you are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. At Kurrent Music we are just starting to explore new ways our curated data can be leveraged to provide a whole new experience when listening, watching or reading about music, it's very exciting!\" www.kurrentmusic.com\nKurrent Music can be accessed at www.kurrentmusic.com where you can sign up to be a blogger or a user free of charge; you can also reach them via email at kontact@kurrentmusic.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:57:41.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
