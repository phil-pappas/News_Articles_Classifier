Amy Schumer: I 'struggle' with body image Filed Under: Celebrities & Gossip \nComedian Amy Schumer has heaped praise on her stylist, Leesa Evans, for helping her put confidence ahead of body image issues. \nThe Trainwreck star has made a career out of not caring what the fashion police say about her style choices, but she admits she has privately struggled to feel comfortable in what she wears and it has affected her career. \n\"It's an emotional thing,\" she told Today in an emotional interview. \"It's been a struggle for me my whole life, and especially just being in the entertainment industry. Standing on a stage in front of people, I can't perform my best or be confident if I'm not sure - if I'm pulling at something (I'm wearing). And sometimes, I would just want to throw in the towel and be like, 'I'm not gonna go do stand-up tonight.'\" \nHowever, the 34-year-old's outlook was given a makeover by Evans, who Schumer recruited to help her and her younger sister make better style choices. \n\"My sister and I, we both have always dressed badly,\" she continues. \"Leesa had given me this gift of showing me how to dress and feel good. And she didn't have to do this, she just did. \n\"She shopped for my sister also, and seeing my little sister wearing a little blazer and a shirt and looking just like a strong, beautiful woman, I realized that holding myself back was also holding her back. So to see this person I care the most about being given those tools was really moving for me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:02:43.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
