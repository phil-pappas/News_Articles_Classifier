I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\"\nThe 47-year-old star added he had not given \"any thought\" to what he would do next.\nHe said: \"For at least a year or two, I just don't want to think about it. I don't know what the next step is. I've no idea. Not because I'm trying to be cagey. Who the f*** knows? At the moment, we've done it. I'm not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\"\nAs for potential his successor, Craig said his advice would be that they \"embrace it\".\n\"Don't be s***. You've got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now. So don't be s***,\" he added.\nSpectre reunites Craig with director Sam Mendes after 2012's Skyfall became the highest-grossing Bond film in history.\nShare article Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear return for Spectre, alongside newcomers to the franchise such as Christoph Waltz, Andrew Scott, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman.\nSpectre opens in cinemas on October 26.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-08T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:56:14.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
