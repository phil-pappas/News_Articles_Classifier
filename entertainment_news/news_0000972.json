I get judged, harassed, and I try to take the high road. \n\"Sometimes it isn't easy. But we keep trying.\" \nBut Justin now says he's not bitter about the media attention. \n\"I think there are good people and bad people with every job, I just try to take it with a grain of salt and not focus on the hate but just focus on the love.\" \nFor the moment it seems Justin is on an even keel although he admits it's been a long road for him. \n\"It's been really tough, I think that's just the journey of growing up and being a man,\" he told Newsbeat. \n\"You're going to go through downfalls you're going to go through ups and downs. It's just how you rise to the occasion and just come out through the other side.\" \nWith a new album reportedly due out next month he also revealed his pal Ed will feature. \n\"We did a song for my album. Him and I co-wrote this song, it's really awesome and I cant wait for people to hear it.\" \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:34:48.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
