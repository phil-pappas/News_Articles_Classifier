It may be do-or-die time for the people who have sought for years to preserve that herd, said to be the largest population of white deer in the world.\n\"For entities or individuals or organizations that are interested in the white deer, especially as a tourism draw, this would be their opportunity to turn those aspirations into reality,\" said Robert Aronson, executive director of the Seneca County Industrial Development Agency.\nThe Seneca IDA, which owns the land, has scheduled a Nov. 7 information meeting to let the public know what's coming. The agency tentatively plans to begin accepting bids on the acreage Dec. 15, Aronson said.\nDennis Money, head of a group that has long worked to save the white deer herd, said he only learned Thursday of the public meeting and the possibility of bids being sought in December.\n\"This definitely is the eleventh hour regarding the fate of the depot,\" Money said. \"We just have to continue to do the best job we can so we can get part of it. We haven’t worked all these 18 years for nothing, so we’ll give it our best shot.’’\nHis group, Seneca White Deer , is attempting to raise $2 million to purchase a portion of the depot for a deer preserve. He also has hopes that a government body, perhaps Seneca County, could acquire and set aside some land for the animals.\nThe former Seneca Army Depot property, in the middle of Seneca County about 40 miles southeast of Rochester, is storied and unique. For decades it was a U.S. Army storage site, home to explosive munitions and to secret, carefully guarded \"special weapons\" bunkers that held nuclear arms. It was a city unto itself, with housing, mess halls, roads, utilities, a rail spur and a runway that could accommodate large jets.\nLocal residents, many of whom had family members who worked there, were loyal to and protective of the depot and often refused to talk to outsiders about such things as special weapons. In the early 1980s, though, thousands of nuclear disarmament activists from around the nation descended on the rural area to protest the nuclear weapons' presence.\nAfter the base was closed and the Army withdrew in 2000, virtually the entire depot — 10,600 acres and all its buildings — were pledged to the IDA, which has since marketed it as one of the largest and best-equipped development sites in all of upstate New York. The agency has gradually taken title to land as the Army completes environmental remediation of it. About 1,000 acres still must be cleaned up and transferred, Aronson said.\nOver the years, several companies have purchased or leased some of the land. Hillside Children's Center has a residential facility on former depot property. New York state built a prison there, and Seneca County its law-enforcement center.\nThe IDA is left with 7,000 acres, and intends to unload them all, Aronson said.\nHe does not think it will be a hard sell. \"We’ve had people approach us to purchase the whole depot that’s left,\" he said. \"Based on those prior unsolicited bids, we’re optimistic we’ll receive offers for the entire acreage.\"\nThese bunkers at the Seneca Army Depot, once used to store nuclear weapons, are now marketed as secure storage or testing facilities. (Photo: Jay Capers, Democrat and Chronicle)\nThe agency will release a bid package as early as mid-December, and give prospective buyers 2½ or three months to respond, Aronson said.\nThose buyers can bid on the whole parcel or part of it. If two or more bids are received on the same acreage, the highest bid won't necessarily win out. \"The IDA is committed to its mission of economic development, so a bid that paves the wave for investment and jobs … could outweigh a bid for the best market price,\" Aronson said.\nWhether any bids are received — and accepted — to purchase land for a white-deer preserve remains to be seen.\nThe beautiful animals, which number about 200, have lived behind the tall fence that surrounds the depot property since the Army established a base there in 1941. They are not albinos but a white variant of the white-tailed deer that live wild in upstate New York.\nProtected from predators and provided limited opportunity to breed with their brown cousins, the herd has remained intact for more than seven decades. The fear has been that removal of the fence would allow the herd to disperse and breed with brown deer, and quickly disappear.\nA number of parties, including Seneca White Deer, have advocated fiercely for continued protection of the herd.\nBut whoever buys the depot property may have other ideas.\n\"We don’t know exactly what will happen with the white deer,\" Aronson said. \"Some prospective buyers may decide to tear down the fence. Some might decide to keep it up. We don’t know that and we can’t control that.\"\nThe website created by the IDA to market the depot land shows a parcel in the northeast corner of the property that could be an ecotourism site where the white deer could be corralled and protected. Aronson said 1,800 acres of land there has been zoned for conservation uses by the town of Varick.\nBut will someone buy that parcel for ecotourism purposes? \"That’s the $64,000 question,\" he said.\nThe IDA has concluded it does not have the money to maintain such a preserve itself, he said. A \"White Deer Summit\" was convened by the Finger Lakes Institute this summer; it issued a report that includes recommendations but does not identify a party that might be able to acquire land for a preserve.\n\"The sad reality is that there is no solution that anybody’s found or suggested that’s fundable,\" Aronson said. \"That’s why I say we don’t know what’s going to happen.\"\nSORR@DemocratandChronicle.com\nIncludes reporting by staff writer Leo Roth .\nPublic information meeting\nThe Seneca County Industrial Development Agency will hold a public meeting on the impending sale of 7,000 acres of former Seneca Army Depot land at 10 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7.
