Desert Island and Chuck of Tenants Harbor — share a love and talent for marine art and architecture. Art is best known for his paintings and Chuck for his yacht designs. Their previous classes have focused on composition and drawing; in this class, they will go into greater depth on using paint to make beautiful pictures. The focus will be on creating scenes with vivid skies, dramatic shores, dynamic boats in motion and active seas. \nInstruction will include on what colors to use, how to mix them and techniques for applying paint in order to achieve desired results. Classes will be structured, with an in-depth look at each of the four components (one subject in each class). Classes will include looking at good examples, teacher demonstrations, students painting their own studies with coaching, group critiques and question/answer periods. Class size will be about eight students, assuring lots of individual attention from the two instructors. \nThe fee is $125 for all four sessions for those who register and pay in advance. The rate for any one session on a drop-in basis, paid at the door, is $42. Classes will be held indoors at the museum, formerly the site of the Snow Shipyard on the waterfront in the city’s South End. For registration and more information, call 701-5050 or email sailpowersteammuseum@gmail.com. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
