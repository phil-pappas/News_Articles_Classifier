Cancer is a b*stard in any form, but pancreatic cancer is one of the worst. However, despite the odds, Hurt is thriving thanks to his treatment, and oncologists are reportedly thrilled with his now \"fantastic prognosis.\" Given his appearance at London Film Festival Suffragette Premiere, he's come on leaps and bounds.\nAccording to sources, Hurt said the following while attending the Man Booker Prize earlier in the week: \"I had the final scan yesterday [Monday] and I saw my oncologist this morning [Tuesday]. I am overjoyed, I am thrilled. It all looks great for the future, it's fantastic.\" While he didn't want to jinx things by using the word \"remission\" even \"if itâ€™s true.\"\nHis agent added to BBC Norfolk: \"Sir John has been given very good news by his oncologist but it falls short of an all-clear. Nonetheless it's very good news.\"\nIt is extremely good news and it sounds like they caught it in the nick of time. If you're ever concerned, don't rest on your laurels, do something about it.\nVia The Huffington Post\nMORE: Capture the colour of October and #paintitpink this Breast Cancer Awareness Month!\nMORE: New survey says Ireland amongst the most tolerant of EU nations\nMORE: Watch: Corden opens show with tribute to Oregon victims, Obama says 'We're becoming numb to this'", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/10/15/john-hurt-news-pancreatic-cancer-diagnosis_n_8300392.html?utm_hp_ref=celebrity"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:33:30.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
