Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nFormer senator Jim Webb, who introduced himself to voters last week by calling attention to how little anyone was paying attention to him, is reportedly about to drop out of the Democratic presidential race, according to Fox News . He rarely popped above one percent in the polls, and his brand of Democratic conservatism, the same kind worn by many of the senators who lost close races in the 2014 midterms, wasn't catching on. Webb began his career as a Republican and once worked in the Reagan administration.\nHowever, bowing out of the Democratic contest wouldn't necessarily mean that Webb was vanishing from the race completely. He is reportedly thinking about running as an independent instead. Webb will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. on Tuesday to discuss the future of his bid. James Fallows wrote on Monday that \"it seems natural, almost fated, rather than disorienting or disturbing that he would contemplate an independent run for president, rather than continuing as a Democrat.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/19/jim-webb-may-be-contemplating-running-as-an-independent-instead-of-as-a-democrat/", "http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/10/jim-webb-independent/411409/", "http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/20/webb-to-drop-out-democratic-2016-race/"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:25:47.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
