Not many staffs have that.\n\"We have a club that believes in our pitching as well, but we have a lot of firepower in our lineup. A lot of it is young. I consider Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro young still, along with the other guys who came up recently.\"\nThanks to deep pockets (a six-year, $155 million contract for Jon Lester) and keen trades (acquiring 22-game winner Jake Arrieta and setup man Pedro Strop from the Orioles two years ago), the Cubs were able to supplement their offense with top pitching.\nMeanwhile, the Mets had enough depth to trade four pitching prospects to acquire slugger Yoenis Cespedes and infielders Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe to strengthen a feeble offense that was leaning heavily on its rotation.\nPhotos of the Cubs catcher (and outfielder) Kyle Schwarber in action.\nDespite speculation that the Cubs and Mets were a perfect fit — heightened by a comment by Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer that a trade \"would happen at some point\" — Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said a trade never was close at the deadline this year.\n\"They're probably happy they didn't make a trade, and we're happy we didn't make a trade,\" Alderson said.\nAnd both teams have a right to be content with their draft strategy.\n\"That's what it's all about — finding talented guys who want to play the game the right way and care about their teammates more than themselves and understanding that everyone is here to win,\" McLeod said. \"In our case, be a part of making history.\"\nJavier Baez's late-season contribution further validates his selection as the ninth overall pick in the 2011 draft under then-GM Jim Hendry and adds to a collection of homegrown talent that includes fellow first-round picks Kris Bryant (2013) and Kyle Schwarber (2014) and Cuban outfielder Jorge Soler, signed as an amateur free agent.\nCubs officials scouted Schwarber and Mets 2014 first-round pick Michael Conforto during a college tournament in Surprise, Ariz. More intrigued by Schwarber's power, the Cubs chose him fourth overall, six picks before the Mets took Conforto.\nThe Mets' 2010 draft produced two starting pitchers — first-round pick Harvey and seventh-round choice deGrom — and reliever Erik Goeddel. That threesome arrived sooner than left-hander Steven Matz, a second-round pick in the 2009 draft who was 4-0 in six starts this season.\nInterestingly, the Mets' last four first-round picks have been position players — outfielder Brandon Nimmo, shortstop Gavin Cecchini, first baseman Dominic Smith and Conforto.\nIt's one thing to identify talent. But the greatest reward for the organization is when those high picks polish their skills in the minors and make the leap to the majors. That's why the Cubs honored their scouts and player development staffers before Game 3 of the NL Division Series.\n\"I remember all the ground balls that (infield coordinator) Jose Flores worked with Kris Bryant on, to (special assistant) Anthony Iapoce spending hours in the batting cage with Soler and Baez, and all these guys to all the scouts who signed them and identified them, it makes you feel that much greater and makes you feel our process is working,\" McLeod said.\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball New York Mets Chicago Cubs Jorge Soler Kris Bryant Matt Harvey National League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625062a/turbine/chi-jorge-soler-photos-20140825", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56253500/turbine/ct-draft-cubs-mets-spt-1020-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625168b/turbine/chi-photos-cubs-prospect-kyle-schwarber"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:05:36.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
