With Spectre co-star Monica Bellucci (Andrew Medichini/AP) \nHe told The Sunday Times’s Culture magazine: “If me and my mates went out and all got shit-faced, and someone started taking photographs, they’d get thumped. \n“The other thing I don’t get is, people are happy to take pictures of me without asking. But things have changed so rapidly. Here he is posing for a photo (Gero Breloer/AP) \n“Nobody really gives a fuck what I think about the modern world, but that part I can do without.” \nQuestions remain about Daniel’s future as Bond – a character, by his own admission, who is deeply flawed and misogynistic – and he said he does not care who takes on the role. This time he’s taking the photo himself (Rob Griffith/AP) \nHe said: “The right person for the job should do the job and I don’t give a fuck what colour their skin is. \n“It shouldn’t be an issue. We should have moved on.” And here he is obliging fans and photographers (Gero Breloer/AP) \nSpectre reunites Daniel with director Sam Mendes after 2012′s Skyfall became the highest-grossing Bond film in history. \nNaomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear return for Spectre, alongside newcomers to the franchise such as Christoph Waltz, Andrew Scott, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Lea Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Stephanie Sigman.
