They called them Savannah Squares.\nBack | Next Howard Hackney photo\nThe recipe used to make Savannah Squares.\nBy Teri Bell O n Oct. 20, 1990, a group of 1,000 people joined together in 23 kitchens around Savannah and baked 120,000 chocolate chip bars.\nBy the end of the day, the bars were baked, packaged, boxed and transported to a warehouse for shipment to the 24th Infantry stationed in Saudi Arabia. How this came about is a story to be remembered and an example of what a community can do when it pulls together.\nMy dear friend Pat Hackney stopped by the restaurant to share this story of the Savannah Square-Lift with me last week. Even 25 years later, she is in awe of how fast it all came together. She was quick to tell me she didn’t want accolades. She didn’t make this project happen — it was only made possible by a committed community working together for a common cause.\nLove of country and the men and women working to defend it, a Hostess City with a plethora of resources and the big hearts of its citizens is what made the Savannah Square-Lift a success.\nSaddam Hussein had recently invaded Kuwait and 20,000 troops from the 24th Infantry based out of Fort Stewart and Hunter had been deployed to the Persian Gulf. On Aug. 24, 1990, Pat, who was serving as chair of the Voluntary Action Center for the United Way, met with the president and director of United Way of Coastal Georgia.\nBill Haile told her how much he enjoyed receiving chocolate chip cookies in Vietnam. “Pat, people around town are saying that Savannah needs to do something to show support for our 24th Infantry.”\nPat, who was also the Home Economist for Chatham County, knew what it took to make a batch of cookies but wasn’t so sure about baking cookies for 20,000 people. That weekend, still thinking about chocolate chip cookies, she pulled a package of Nestle Chocolate Morsels from her pantry and found a recipe on the back of the package for a pan cookie. She said to her husband, we could make a cookie batter, bake them in a pan and cut them into squares and call them “Savannah Squares.”\nPat baked a batch of cookies and took them with her to the initial meeting with the core group of United Way volunteers. The committee tossed around several ideas, but settled on sending six Savannah Squares to each soldier.\nPat enlarged the recipe for 48 cookies to 120,000 cookies and created a supply list. What happened next is nothing short of miraculous. People who knew people started making phone calls. Pat’s brother was president of Nestle Foods at the time and Nestle was delighted to donate 1,400 pounds of chocolate chips, but the rest of the resources needed for the project were right here in Savannah!\nUnion Camp came on board and produced a special bag. The employees in the box plant got together on a Saturday afternoon to place the big Savannah Square-Lift labels on each of the specially designed boxes used in shipping. Savannah Foods and Industries, the producers of Dixie Crystal Sugar, agreed to donate 1,660 pounds of light brown sugar and 1,440 pounds of white sugar. They also offered their warehouse to store all the baking supplies until bake day.\nDerst Baking Company donated the flour. Savannah called on their food company contacts and secured 1,875 pound of Land O’Lakes Butter and Reynolds Aluminum Foil for wrapping the cookies.\nCindy Jacobs met Pat one Sunday afternoon at her church and watched Pat prepare the recipe and wrote the step-by-step instructions. She created a training handbook and trained the bake site. After each set of directions she added, “Repeat process and keep smiling.”\nOn Oct. 20, 1990, just 57 days from the initial meeting, the volunteers came together in commercial, school, hospital and church kitchens to bake, package and box the Savannah Squares. Chatham County Transit Authority handled the delivery of all the baking ingredients to the sites on Friday and the pickup and transfer to the warehouse on Saturday.\nOn Oct. 21, 5 tons of Savannah Squares were loaded on a flat bed and trucked to Dover, Del., and on Oct. 22 the Savannah Squares were airlifted to Saudi Arabia. On Oct. 23, thanks to Gulfstream and their aviation contacts, 10 volunteers flew to Saudi Arabia to personally deliver each soldier a bag containing six squares and a handwritten letter from local school children. One soldier, as fate would have it, actually received a bag with a note from his own daughter!\nThis brief story is just a drop in the bucket of the events that took place in those 57 days. The businesses owners, citizens, volunteers and military personnel that made this happen are far too many to mention, but then the bars weren’t baked for recognition. The rewards live in the memories of the members of the homesick 24th Infantry who received a little bit of Savannah in the middle of the desert.\nTeri Bell is co-owner of Miss Sophie’s Marketplace at the Mighty Eighth in Pooler.
