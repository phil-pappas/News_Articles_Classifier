In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill has shared that the movie will begin with the Battle of Metropolis that was featured at the end of Man of Steel, but this time, it's shown from the perspective of Bruce Wayne, reports aceshowbiz.com.\n\"What happens there is one of Bruce's buildings gets destroyed and he's trying to save all the people inside the building and he can't. So he is this angry person who fears what Superman may do. Why are they just going to trust this super-powered alien? What if he does decide to turn against us?\" said Cavill.\nHe also revealed that Wayne begins to harbour \"a tremendous amount of rage for Superman\".\n\"So it's how he got there, and what that's done to him, and what that's done to people around him like Alfred, who are, I think, very scared and worried for him. It's something that's interesting and new,\" Cavill added.\nThe fact that Cavill has described the scenes as a \"prologue\", has led to speculations that the scenes will only be the opening of the film.\nDawn of Justice also stars Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Women, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Amy Adams as Lois Lane and Ray Fisher as Cyborg. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie is set for a US release on March 25 next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:30:41.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
