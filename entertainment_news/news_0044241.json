People have a funny way of looking at (my clothes),\" the 30-year old said.\n\"But then I like the fact that it is creating drama in the minds of the people.\"\nThe men and women in the group say they want to challenge the traditional notions of African fashion and they take to social media platforms to share their creative outfits.\nAged 19 to 38, they mix tailored jackets, printed T-shirts, vintage dresses, flares, and foulards in quirky, sometimes eccentric, ensembles more often seen in London than Accra.\nKissi can be regularly seen posing for photo shoots across the city in colorful clothes usually accessorized with sunglasses and a form-fitting cloth bonnet.\nThose styled portraits and selfies, regularly uploaded online, have turned him into a local celebrity with his clothes as well as music drawing crowds to his parties.\n\"I have found myself as an artist,\" he said.\nKissi and his friends regularly meet in an art studio to exchange ideas. They say they do not have role models but look up to the \"Sapeurs of Kinshasa\", who turned fashion into a polished art form during the times of Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire.\nBut their unique style has also drawn criticism from the more conservative locals.\n\"I was told I wasn't going to get a husband. I would be called names on the bus,\" artist Sena Ahadji, who used to have a mohawk, said.\nBut support from others in the group helped her overcome the negative comments.\n\"A lot of pressure left me,\" she said. \"I am me. I am African. The fabric doesn't make me African. My hair doesn't make me African, but I know who I am.\"\n(Reporting By Francis Kokoroko in Accra; Editing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian/Jeremy Gaunt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:04:33.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
