But none from that time period has been quoted more, talked about more and reproduced more than Silence of the Lambs. It was a movie with so many twists, turns and even more ghastly twists that by the end, your brain and soul felt like they’d been through a meat grinder. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The movie’s list of antagonists was long, but none were more reviled that Buffalo Bill. Not the loving kid’s show host from the early eighties, no.

Some people think it is a signal to the space creatures. A light that guides their spaceships to the Arizona desert. Or, maybe it doesn't mean anything. Just a freak of nature. Whatever it might be, it started over a thousand years ago when the boulder people first began living there. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen In 1974, a young family from Washington was looking for a good place to build their dream home. For some strange reason they were intrigued by an ad they found for land in the high Sonoran Desert near Scottsdale, Arizona that read, “Does anyone want to buy my pile of rocks?” Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen They bought it and planned to build a contemporary home next to the mysterious pile of ancient rocks. But something made them change their minds. They decided to build their new home inside the boulders. Behind the billion-year-old rocks from the Precambrian era. About the same time that hard-shelled life forms first showed up on earth. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen During the construction, the couple was excited to find evidence that they weren’t the first people to live in the boulders. Pottery shards and rock carvings they discovered were dated back as far as one thousand years. Then they found something even more astonishing - a Stonehenge-type phenomenon that occurs on both the spring and fall equinoxes. A six-inch wide beam of light that starts in the glass between two boulders and slowly works its way across the floor and up the wall to a 36” spiral petroglyph. When the sun hit its mark, the stone projections light up like diamonds.

Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The Dakota. John Lennon moved into The Dakota in 1973 and lived there until he was murdered outside the building’s 72nd Street entry in 1980 by a deranged fan. The building’s exterior was filmed as the home of Mia Farrow’s devil-mama character in Rosemary’s Baby. Some people say it is the scariest building in New York City with a long history of ghosts and hauntings. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The Dakota is a mix of French Renaissance, German Gothic and English Victorian architecture with steep-pitched roofs, dormers, balconies, pavilions, demented gargoyles and a mysterious Indian figure watching over the building's main entrance. Legend is that it was named “The Dakota” because it was built in 1884 in the boondocks, far away from the most popular areas of Manhattan. A long history of ghastly stories surround The Dakota including tales of worker's arms forced into lights to burn them, ghostly children roaming the halls, former music legends in the foyer and tenants having metal bars thrown at them in the building’s basement. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The Dakota has been home to many New York celebrities including Maury Povich, who describes the building as “very haunted.” Lauren Bacall, Leonard Bernstein, Rosemary Clooney, Jason Robards, Judy Garland and Roberta Flack were longtime residents.

Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The \"Scarface\" Killing MansionIn the 1950s and early 60s, Miami Beach was the most popular vacation destination in the United States. A glamorous town of upscale oceanfront hotels such as the Fontainebleau, Eden Roc and Deauville (where the Beatles made their first American performance on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964) and nightclubs where the biggest celebrities including Frank Sinatra and Jackie Gleason partied and performed. Gambling was tolerated, A-list strippers kept the conventioneers happy and the five New York crime families declared it to be “open territory” where anything was tolerated. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen By the late 1970s, Miami was a wasteland of drugs and murder. So many people were robbed and killed that travelers were advised to avoid South Florida. In 1980, the city had 573 murders. Things were so bad, the county morgue couldn't handle the workload and rented a refrigerated truck to store the excess of dead bodies. South Beach was mostly flop houses and senior citizens trying to escape the wide-open drug gang wars. Some people said the Magic City had become the devil's playground. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen In 1983, Oliver Stone wrote the script for Scarface at the same time he was fighting off his own cocaine addiction. For those viewing the film in the majority of the country, it was just entertainment, but for those who lived in the Miami area, it was the frightening truth. Tony Montana, Al Pacino’s character, was as realistic as they came. The famous chainsaw scene, filmed at the Sun Ray Apartments on South Beach's Ocean Drive, was close to the real thing.

Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen COLORADO GHOST TOWN!Colorado was the home base for some of the Wild West's most notorious outlaws. Robbing banks and highjacking the stage coach payroll was all in a day’s work for bandits such as Butch Cassidy, who got his start in Telluride, Colorado as a horse thief before graduating to robbing banks in Denver. Butch and many of his fellow crooks had hideouts in the Rocky Mountains where they had an eagle-eye view of any approaching posses on their trail. A place like Uptop, Colorado – a former ghost town now for sale at a bargain price of $1 million. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The town was established in the 1870s shortly after the Denver & Rio Grand Railroad carved out the “Railway Above the Clouds” - the world's highest elevation train tracks at over 9,300 feet. Uptop later became a coal mining town and tourist attraction until a new highway in the 1960s brought an end to the good times. By the late 1990s, everyone was gone. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The Lathrop Gang, two green-horn sisters from Boston, bought the town in 2001 and began to renovate the deteriorating buildings. The sisters brought the 42-acre town back to life restoring a train depot, dance hall, saloon, chapel, meeting hall and large log cabin. Top Ten Real Estate Deals A frightening good deal, the town is now free of ghosts and cowboy outlaws and on the National Historic Register for sale at $1 million. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen THE SOWDEN HOUSE!The history of a home can reflect many things. It can encompass the lives of those that have lived there, the architect whose deft skill built the home and even in some cases, the mysteries that surround the dwelling. The Sowden House in Los Angeles hits home on all three fronts. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen An architectural marvel, the Sowden House is the brainchild of noted architect Lloyd Wright, son of Frank Lloyd Wright. Seen as one of Wright’s most important works, the 5,600-square-foot home with four bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half bathrooms is a landmark wreathed in luxury and unique style. The home’s design is reminiscent of ancient architecture from South America given over to a Mayan motif. Its wide open rooms and beautiful interior would give a warm and welcoming feeling if it weren’t for the fact that if you step on the wrong patio paver, you could set off a spike trap. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen What’s truly unique about the home is a macabre history of rumors and stigma. Stories swirl around this home like moths around a flame (a flame from a fire that you could be relaxing by on the patio) about the previous owner, Los Angeles Doctor George Hodel, and his involvement in the Black Dahlia Murder in 1947. Many people, including his son, believe that Hodel was behind the brutal killing, mutilation and dismemberment of Elizabeth Short. Elizabeth was sliced in half by someone with the skilled hands of a surgeon and then the blood was drained from her body. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen Time may have removed some of the stain from the home’s dark history, but it still has seen visits from TV shows such as Ghost Hunters and Paranormal America, even an American Express commercial shot there: “Don’t leave your spooky home without it.” Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen Whatever your belief in the afterlife or history of the Dahlia murder, the home is a beautiful estate, a bargain at the asking price of $4,799,000. Still on the market, somebody will snatch this place up quickly, so don’t wait for the price to be sliced in half. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen NEW YORK'S MOST FASHIONABLE HAUNTED HOUSE!The House on Haunted Hill, The House at the End of the Street, Last House on the Left,… all terrifying names that make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The house on Richmond Road…as far as foreboding names go, doesn’t quite have that King-esque ring to it, certainly. But what the home lacks in a scary address, it more than makes up for in its strange history and spooky ambiance. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The Gustav Mayer House, a landmark mansion built in 1855 by New York Militia commander David Ryers, changed hands in 1889 to Mr. Mayer. The home would be owned by Gustav (one of the original 114 bakery owners that made up Nabisco) and his family until the 1980s. His daughters, who in their later years were so reclusive that they refused to leave the home, lowering baskets out of windows to collect groceries, laundry and the mail were the last of the Mayer family to live in the home. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The house was chipped and fading when its future owner, Bob Troiano, saw it as a young man and fell in love with the estate known as the Staten Island Grey Gardens. It wasn’t until the 1990s when Mr. Troiano finally purchased the 7,700-square-foot, 10-bedroom home. He immediately remodeled the first floor into a stylish and trendy living space that paid homage to the past in style. His family began the renovation of the upstairs when people began to get shot there, and that stopped everything. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The shooting was done by photographers from all over the fashion map, as the home’s eerie decay became a fashion hotspot for high-end magazines. From the first-floor chic to the second floor shriek, the home couldn’t be more different. This attracted high-fashion names like Elle, Vogue, Fossil, W and even one of the Olsen twins did a photo shoot behind the crumbling upstairs walls. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Its amazing history, fashion-friendly décor, view of Raritan Bay and fixer-upper status (if you want to take away the money making potential) are well worth the $2.31 million price tag. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Just be aware that most in the fashion industry would love to see this home stay “as is” and not turned into “some clean yuppie mansion.” Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen THE JP MORGAN GREAT CAMP!John Pierpont “JP” Morgan was bigger than Warren Buffett and Steve Jobs combined, the financial genius of the late 1800s and early 1900s creating General Electric and U.S. Steel. He was the nation's banker providing loans in both 1895 and 1907 to keep the government afloat. Morgan was a huge man who suffered from several facial issues that left him with a grotesque purple nose such that children and even some adults were afraid to look at him. He was scheduled to sail on the ill-fated Titanic but canceled at the last minute. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen While no one has claims to have seen JP Morgan's ghost, there are several disturbing incidents surrounding the family. Morgan's former Long Island mansion is said to be haunted by his daughter who is sometimes seen walking the corridors in a long black dress. The late comedian Joan Rivers claimed that her New York home was haunted by Morgan's niece who would visit her every night at 3 a.m. Top Ten Real Estate Deals If there is a JP Morgan ghost, he would probably be found at his vacation compound, Great Camp Uncas, on secluded Mohegan Lake in Upstate New York. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen Built in 1895 by William West Durant, the camp was in the hands of the Morgan family for half a century. It is one of the country's best examples of rustic vacation-camp compounds built in the late 1800s for America's wealthiest families. The kind of landscape usually seen in horror movies with soaring tree shadows, never-ending walking trails, stark cabins and quiet nights except for the hooting owls and the occasional chop of an ax murderer. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen This linchpin of what Durant called “America’s most beautiful trio” is the main house at Great Camp Uncas. Selling fully furnished and decorated, perfect for anyone who loves the outdoors, the main lodge and guest cabins on 4.6 acres with 1,700 feet of lake shoreline, surrounded by tens of thousands of acres of state-owned forest preserve, are for sale at an asking price of $2.95 million. Top Ten Real Estate Deals JEFFERY DAHMER BOYHOOD HOME! Things that make nightmares play in the shadows of our minds when forced to deal with the fact that they really occurred - not just a horror film scene. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen Such is the case with Jeffery Dahmer and his childhood Ohio home which has been on and off the market for several years. The home is where Dahmer killed and dismembered his first victim, scattering the remains about the woods and burying parts under the porch. Dahmer had just turned 18. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen The home is 2,170 square feet with gleaming hardwood floors, high-end appliances and lush landscaping. It was even featured in a 1953 Akron Beacon Journal article along with multiple home photos – very similar to Better Homes and Gardens. While beautiful, it is the epitome of a “tough sell.” The most recent agent has said of the home that, “It is a tough sell, but not impossible. Even stating of it, “The home never killed anyone.” While that is true, maybe not something you’d usually list as a selling point. Top Ten Real Estate Deals Fullscreen There has been interest in the home including PETA that wanted to turn the home into a vegan restaurant (because God knows the stigma surrounding the place wouldn’t allow you to have a steak house) but they were turned down due to zoning restrictions. Top Ten Real Estate Deals The most recent asking price was $295,000.
