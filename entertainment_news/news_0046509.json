Come on, you can't want the good without the bad.\" \nNicki added that if the 22-year-old pop star really wants to embrace black culture, she needs to do more than just dance, have fun, twerk and rap. \n\"You should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us,\" she added. \"You shouldn't not want to know that.\" \nAfter the nominations came out, Nicki used Twitter to insist that she if she was a \"different 'kind' of artist\", Anaconda would have made the cut. \n\"If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated,\" she added on Twitter. \nThis riled y, who told The New York Times that she didn't respect the statement \"because of the anger that came with it\" before adding that Nicki was \"not too kind\". \nBut 32-year-old Nicki got her first chance to say her piece while picking up the award for Best Hip Hop Video at the ceremony. \nAt the end of her acceptance speech she turned to host Cyrus and said: \"And now... back to this b**ch that had a lot to say about me in the press. Miley, what's good?\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:26:05.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
