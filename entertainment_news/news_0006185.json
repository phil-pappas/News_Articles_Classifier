Riders then accelerate through a number of tunnels in a 100-year-old building. The ride also has several hills and a 104-degree overbanked turn, according to a news release.\nAll of this leads to the highlight of the ride: An 87-degree dead-end track dubbed the “Grand Spike.”\nThe Express-News reported in July that an 87-degree, mid-course spire gives the Switchback the honors as the wooden roller coaster with the world's steepest drop.\nRELATED: Batman: The Ride soars into Six Flags Fiesta Texas\n“The design of Switchback has been one of the most exciting and challenging endeavors of my 17 years in the business,” Gravity Group LLC partner Chad Miller said in a news release. “To be part of something this different and unique has been incredibly fun.”\nThe roller coaster is inspired by the very first roller coaster to open in the United States, which opened in 1884 at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York.\nThe Switchback made USA Today’s list of most anticipated new roller coasters of 2015.\nZDT’s Amusement Park opened in 2007 and has become a great source of family entertainment.\nThe hours of operation for the park vary, but can be found here .\nClick through the slideshow to see photos of the thrilling new ride at ZDT’s Amusement Park.\ntwhite@mysa.com\nTwitter: @tylerlwhite", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796532/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796544/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796547/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796535/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/tylerlwhite", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796538/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796535/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796528/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796545/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796543/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796539/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796540/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796534/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796544/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796529/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.zdtamusement.com/hours/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796541/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796536/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796543/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796546/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796531/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796542/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796536/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796527/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796539/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2015/03/25/new-roller-coasters-2015/70438778/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796530/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-roller-coaster-in-america-opens", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796528/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796532/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796542/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796538/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796527/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796530/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796534/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796529/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796547/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796545/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/46/8796546/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796531/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796541/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.zdtamusement.com/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/45/8796540/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:16:17.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
