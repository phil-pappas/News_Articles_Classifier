Leading up to Formula 1, Sharon Schweitzer , founder of Protocol & Etiquette Worldwide and the best-selling author of Access to Asia , is Austin's leading source in helping business leaders and executives with cross-cultural training and bridging cultures with international visitors.\n\"Whether entertaining in the grandstand or discussing business in a conference room, Formula 1 is our opportunity to leave a global impression,\" said Schweitzer, who has over 20 years of international experience. \"Our first responsibility as hosts is to make others feel welcome in our city and to share the cultural experiences that make Austin , and the organizations here, unique.\"\nSchweitzer is an expert on global customs and cultures and advises Austin's leaders on how to become culturally in tune with their international counterparts. In 2012, Schweitzer was part of the team that conducted a series of business preparedness workshops in anticipation of Austin welcoming hundreds of thousands of international visitors to F1's launch at Circuit of the Americas.\nLeading up to this year's event, Schweitzer is hosting cross-cultural trainings with several Fortune 500 companies and groups such as the Austin Chamber of Commerce, sharing advice about cultural faux pas, body language, and more. Preparing for F1 by gaining a cultural awareness and understanding of business differences can provide a distinct advantage to corporations, build global leaders and help avoid deal-breaking moments.\n\"Before seeking to understand another culture, it is important to hold up a mirror to our own culture,\" added Schweitzer. \"We must gain a strong understanding of our U.S. culture before hosting international guests whose attitudes and behaviors are quite different.\"\nSchweitzer's trainings include key elements and tips, like showing appreciation for another's culture just as you do your own, becoming patient and comfortable with silence, recognizing that concepts of time vary globally and learning a few phrases of your guest's language to help break the ice and build the relationship.\nIn addition to Sharon Schweitzer's cross-cultural training workshops, business leaders who frequently host Asian guests or who travel to Asia can glean cultural insights from the bestselling, international-award winning book, Access to Asia: Your Multicultural Business Guide . In Access to Asia , Schweitzer dives into intercultural relationship building and international etiquette across the globe, in the U.S.A. and in 10 Asian countries. She sheds new light on belief systems, business protocol, customs and communication styles through insider tips and interviews with more than 130 business professionals and regional experts.\nAbout Sharon Schweitzer\nSharon Schweitzer , J.D., is a cross-cultural and international protocol expert based in Austin, Texas .
