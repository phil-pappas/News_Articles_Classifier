He has had big stages before, outside India — in the UAE and the USA, directing the stage design for the Miss World beauty pageant in 1996.\nHere at the IFFI, he has followed the peacock theme from the logo design to the stages, for the ambience of the festival, to create the mood. “I have really enjoyed it,” he says, a mild voice on a faraway phone call.\nSabu, a Malayali, is always away for work, having become a veteran in art direction after many years in cinema. He has won four national awards and two Kerala State awards.\nThere has also been a Tamil Nadu state award for his work in Kannathil Muthamittal. The last that’s brought him a lot of attention is Baahubali. “It was hard work for two-and-a-half years. I put my heart and soul into it. I couldn’t take any other work in between.”\nSabu has worked in over 115 films in various languages as an art director. In Malayalam cinema, he says, his biggest challenge has been designing the sets of Kalapani. But now it’s time for him to start his work on the second part of Baahubali. “I have to do a better job than the first one!”\nThe last work that’s brought him a lot of attention is Baahubali. “It was hard work for two-and-a-half years. I put my heart and soul into it. I couldn’t take any other work in between.”\n Mollywood Sabu Cyril IFFI Also Read Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli engage in some late night PDA They only want to party: Thammareddy Bharadwaj Taylor Swift dodged death in a mishap Parvathy Nair excited about landing a meaty role", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/SABU-CYRIL.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151016/entertainment-mollywood/article/setting-mood-festival", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/SABU-CYRIL.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:16:26.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
