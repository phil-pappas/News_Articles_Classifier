I think a lot of people bristle at the ready-to-drink cocktail. They think of the Skinny Girl line or something cheesy and saccharine. But when we had High West’s products, and became big fans, we knew we had to try.”\nIn 2010, Utah’s High West pioneered the effort to elevate bottled cocktails above Bud Light’s Lime-A-Rita. After the distillery debuted its barrel-aged 36th Vote Manhattan, com­panies slowly followed, with everything from Moscow Mules to Bloody Marys. This summer, Berkshire Mountain Distillers in Sheffield even perfected bottled gin and tonics and vodka tonics.\nUnlike mass-produced liquor, the micro dis­tillers’ cocktail roots lie in the craft movement.\n“If you look at our gin and tonic, you’ll see it’s a little tan,” Berkshire Mountain founder and distiller Chris Weld said. “It’s because ours has natural color. We steep our own quinine bark to make our own tonic. I love the biochemistry of it, so I wanted to make tonic from scratch.”\nMaking your own tonic or vermouth or bitters, which many micro distillers do, means a lot of experimentation. Weld says he didn’t get the tonic right until the 25th batch. But for these guys, that’s the fun part.\n“It took two years of recipes until we got ours right,” High West’s David Perkins said. “You can’t just grab any vermouth you want and start mixing. You have to think about what you can (get) to do this in 50-­gallon barrels. But I think it paid off. You can’t beat our product.”\nIf that seems bold, taste High West’s Manhattan. It tastes like a fresh $15 cocktail. But these companies don’t worry they’ll be putting bartenders out of business.\n“There are great bar­tenders in this city and all over, but not everybody lives close to a craft cocktail bar,” Willis said. “We made this for those people. And we started with the Old Fashioned because it’s the easiest to make and the most difficult to make well.”\nMany of these bottled cocktails are seasonal, so don’t wait until spring to track down the bourbon-based drinks. Still, Berkshire Mountain’s tonic drinks are set to return late spring, and Bully Boy teases­ something new is coming as well.\n“We’re debuting our first gin soon, and as a big Negroni drinker, I can’t help thinking about making our own bottled Negroni,” Willis said. “Old Fashioned in the winter, Negroni in the summer, what could be better?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:37:25.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
