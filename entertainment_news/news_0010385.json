Oh, Gotham fans may have suspected that Jerome (memorably if briefly played by Cameron Monaghan) would not turn out to be The Joker — but it's likely most of them thought he'd be around for awhile, rather than dying last week. So, good on Gotham: Surprises are tough for ongoing series. As for what or who comes next: Michael Chiklis, who arrives tonight as the new police captain.\nUSA TODAY\nCritic's Corner chat: Mon., 2 p.m. ET\nAfter Jane (Gina Rodriguez) discovers Mateo's abduction, chaos ensues in the Season 2 premiere of 'Jane the Virgin.' (Photo: Greg Gayne, CW)\nJane the Virgin\nCW, 9 ET/PT\nLast fall's best new comedy returns tonight with a crisis of its own to resolve: the abduction of Jane and Rafael's baby. Don't panic: As Jane is a comic take on a telenovela, and a very good one at that, the crisis is resolved quickly, allowing Jane to speed on to the after-effects. Still, in the midst of the nonsense, notice how the show slows long enough for Jane to feel the real-world pressures she's facing — a scene that once again proves Gina Rodriguez is one of our brightest new stars.\nI'll Have What Phil's Having\nPBS, 10 ET/PT (times may vary)\nEverybody Loves Raymond creator Phil Rosenthal continues his global food tour with a stop in Paris. Enjoy the trip, and congratulate Rosenthal for trying to reinvent himself in an industry that's just as ageist toward writers as it is toward actors.\n6 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Lqj2rP CriticsCorner", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799165660524964-gotham-sc30-050-hires2.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RBwKZO", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550966574001_video-still-for-video-4550882485001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b6a7896c45167b78dd7d06132ef13cb06a9f1179/c=414-0-6947-4912&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799165660524964-gotham-sc30-050-hires2.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550966573001_thumbnail-for-video-4550882485001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1Lqj2rP", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550966574001_video-still-for-video-4550882485001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4550966574001_video-still-for-video-4550882485001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b27147577e02a1026e4cab435cf3c9f6b98a9a7f/c=317-0-2977-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799164184122036-JAV201b-0509b.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lqj2rP&text=TV%20tonight%3A%20%27Gotham%2C%27%20%27Jane%20the%20Virgin%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lqj2rP&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799165660524964-gotham-sc30-050-hires2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2012/10/11/critics-corner-promo-01-1_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:25:35.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
