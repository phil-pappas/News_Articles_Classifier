That included time with Jobs’ eldest daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, who had not cooperated with Isaacson because her father was still alive then (Jobs died of cancer 19 days before the book was published). \nSorkin then added fictional dialogue based on known fact and staged the film around three legendary product launches hosted by Jobs in 1984, 1988 and 1998. After Christian Bale twice left the project and other stars from George Clooney to Leonardo DiCaprio to director David Fincher were briefly involved, Michael Fassbender finally played Jobs, giving an electrifying performance that invites an Oscar nom. With the film now playing in theatres across the U.S. and Canada, a jet-lagged but eager Sorkin visited Toronto to talk about his work. Here are the highlights (with my questions edited for brevity): \nWhat is the plan behind the screenplay and its focus on the backstage action before the three product launches of the Macintosh computer, the NeXT and the iMac? \n“Before I knew what I wanted to do, I knew what I didn’t want to do, which was write a biopic, a cradle-to-grave story where we landed on the character’s greatest hits along the way. I got this idea when I tripped over a fairly small, insignificant piece of information, which was that, during the Macintosh launch in 1984, they suddenly couldn’t get the computer to say, ‘Hello!’— and Steve badly wanted it to say ‘Hello!’ So, suddenly, I was thinking about backstage, about those moments leading up to the product launch. I came up with this idea of having the whole thing be just three scenes, each of them in real time with no time cuts and each of them taking place backstage in the moments leading up to a product launch. And it didn’t matter to me at all that Steve did not have confrontations with the same five people 40 minutes before every product launch. The content of those confrontations was real.” \nHow did the film come together after Boyle took over as director following David Fincher’s departure? \n“This movie for me is a triumph of collaboration because the screenplay is built entirely out of language while Danny Boyle is a visual master — and then you have this cast!” \nWhy Fassbender? \n“First of all, he is a phenomenal actor. He is a beast of an actor. So skilled. His instrument, as it’s called — his voice, his body — is so finely tuned. One thing that he won’t do that another movie star might do in a role like this is (ask for sympathy). He doesn’t feel the need to be loved by the audience.” \nWhat is the point of telling Jobs’ story after doing The Social Network, a film about Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who also feuded with his co-founders as Jobs did with Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak? \n“Danny always has a great answer to this. Danny always feels strongly that the titans who are running these companies — Google, Apple, Facebook — are bigger and more powerful than governments now and that they need to be written about by everybody from journalists to artists. I never thought of it that way and, to me, it was just a coincidence that I happened to be writing about my second tech titan (in Steve Jobs). I just thought that these were good stories. But I do think it is important to take complicated people — people who seem difficult on the outside, people who maybe aren’t that likeable on the outside — and examine them a little bit further to either find the root of why that is or find the goodness in them.” \nAs a screenwriter, what is your personal approach to these complicated people? \n“I like to write them as if they’re making their case to God as to why they should be allowed into Heaven.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:59:43.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
