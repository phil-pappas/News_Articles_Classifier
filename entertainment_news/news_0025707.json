And, yes, it rained a little in the late afternoon and evening, not enough to send people home but maybe enough to keep them from setting out in the first place.\nStill, the organizers, the fledgling Chicago Cultural Mile organization, which aims to draw attention to Michigan Avenue south of the Chicago River, pronounced themselves pleased. A spokesman for the group said their event planner had estimated the entire day’s crowd at 200,000, a figure I’ll just say is on par with the generous 1 million the Chicago Air and Water Show has been said to draw each year.\nBy evening, if there were 30,000 people along the parade route, which ran a quick half-mile from Balbo Avenue to Monroe Street, I’d be surprised. But, hey, first-time event. Raindrops.\nAnd the bigger point is that the parade itself was kind of a quirky gem, a hodgepodge of arts organizations showcasing oversized puppetry, along with the occasional marching band and Halloween-themed float. The woodsy one for the Cook County Forest Preserve District, that followed the Chicago Shakespeare Project, was especially haunting.\nHalloween Gathering and Parade The Chicago Cultural Mile Association hosted a new celebration, the Halloween Gathering, on Oct. 24, 2015.

And I think it’s a great idea.\"\nThe idea is to not only draw eyes to the Cultural Mile, aiming to be a southern counterpoint to the Magnificent Mile shopping district north of the river, but to give the city a big, broad Halloween event that might grow over time to become a unifying force on people’s fall calendars.\n“We think in five years this is going to be one of the big live events in Chicago, that people will come in to see an iconic event,” said Sharene Shariatzadeh, executive director of Chicago Cultural Mile, which raised about $500,000 from its executive board to pay for the event.\nThe key to the parade, she said in an interview the day before, is that it is a curated event, rather than just an aggregation of floats, marching bands and politicians seated in the backs of borrowed convertibles.\nRevelers enjoy inaugural Chicago Halloween festival Gregory Pratt When they got married Oct. 29 nearly five years ago, Brett Koppen and his wife, Kimberly, adorned their purple and black wedding cake with \"Corpse Bride\" movie character toppers.\nHalloween is their favorite holiday, so of course they came out Saturday night to watch the inaugural Chicago Halloween...\nWhen they got married Oct. 29 nearly five years ago, Brett Koppen and his wife, Kimberly, adorned their purple and black wedding cake with \"Corpse Bride\" movie character toppers.\nHalloween is their favorite holiday, so of course they came out Saturday night to watch the inaugural Chicago Halloween...\n(Gregory Pratt) “We’ve challenged everyone to not just do the same old thing,” she said. “No politicians. No floats. We want everyone to bring some juice to it.\"\nA few brought weak tea. You’re very funny as an improv evening, Chicago Comedy Sportz, but, ahem, a few folks holding a sign? The Chicago Ladies Improv group, several dozen strong, dressed in matching white plastic, and hamming it up with the crowd, won Saturday’s improv battle.\nOn the potent end of the spectrum, these were among the parade highlights:\nA few dozen from the Joffrey Ballet marching in matching yellow rain slickers and umbrellas lit with blue lights. Maybe it was a quickie response to the weather, but it had a touch of the poetic. A Halloween appropriate car club, the Hardcore Hearse Club, which paraded eight vintage funeral mobiles, vehicles at once macabre and magnificent. The Art Institute wheeling some of (reproductions of) its masterpieces up Columbus. “American Gothic” was especially on point. The Brazilian Cultural Institute bringing dancers, a band and lots of green and yellow. The “Thriller” in-parade “flash mob,” an oldie but still entertaining, and the fire spinning act that, together, formed the parade’s grand finale. And all the big puppets throughout, from the big T. rex by the Field Museum (and Jabberwocky Marionettes) to the 20-foot Statue of Liberty crafted by Inside Out Studio and Mask Shop, on the Northwest Side. These were the kinds of spectacles Rachel Alexander and Miriam Rushan, long-time friends in their late 20s, ventured to the Halloween Gathering hoping to see.\n“Theater people and the Cultural Center and kids and parents and then on top of that, you know, actors and performers,” Rushan said before the parade, nursing an old-fashioned at the bar at Park Grill in Millennium Park. “That’s a nice little medley.\"\n“It’s fun,” added Alexander, “because it carries on from the high of the summer festivals. Nobody wants to let go of being outside.\"\nThe two were in costume, mildly, Rushan as “Jackie O’s long-lost cousin,” Alexander as “Phantom of the North Side.\"\nMore fully garbed were Simon Rubenstein and his son Sergei, 4, both dressed as Tigger.\n“Chicago needs to do more of this kind of thing,” said Rubenstein, of Rogers Park.\nLatara Parker-Davis, 39, from Calumet City, brought her three teenaged kids, drawn by, she said, “a free event and something fun and safe for the kids,” plus the promise of the “Thriller” dance for her 13-year-old daughter who loves Michael Jackson.\nParade goer Victoria Baker, a university administrator who lives downtown, said, “It’s just been a fun (darn) day.\"\n Halloween Michael Jackson", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c3752/turbine/ct-halloween-gathering-and-parade-20151024-video", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c56fc/turbine/ct-halloween-gathering-parade-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c376b/turbine/ct-chicago-halloween-festival-met-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:45:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
