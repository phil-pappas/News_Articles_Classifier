Famously amazing and crazy good at doing TV?’ She was more upset than me when I spoke to her about it. \n“She’s been very caring to me and welcoming and she phones me all the time and checks up on me.” \nCheryl has also been warning Grimmy that the negative comments look set to continue throughout the series. \n“She was like, ‘Just you wait. Everyone gets it on this show.’ I was like, ‘Louis Walsh doesn’t like me!’ and Cheryl was like: ‘Please’,” the music DJ continued. \nNick said he “kind of expected” the negative reaction.
