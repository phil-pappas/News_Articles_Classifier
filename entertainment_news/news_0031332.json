Either of them could be said to have invented more important things than Steve Jobs. But where are all the major Hollywood movies, documentaries and best-selling biographies about Ritchie or Engelbart and the dozens of other key inventors whose contributions were as or more essential than Jobs?\" \nThere has to be another reason that the Steve Jobs story has been told over and over again since the 1980s instead of about men like Ritchie or Engelbart, says Streeter. \"I think the reason is in our culture: we love the story of Jobs because we love the story of the guy who bucked convention, pursued his passions and got rich doing so.\" \nStories like Jobs' are perpetuated by capitalistic machinery that infuses romantic ways of thinking into all areas of society, according to Streeter. The current Steve Jobs craze, which took off in a big way after he stepped down from Apple in 2011, seems to prove the point about Byronic capitalism. \nThe institutional machinery devoted to producing celebrity CEO's is in response to populist criticisms of modern corporations in hopes of making people feel good about a more moral Capitalistic system, writes Streeter. \nThe study appears in the International Journal of Communication (ANI) More Entertainment Industry News   their Â£1.6m   a 'black'  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:22:03.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
