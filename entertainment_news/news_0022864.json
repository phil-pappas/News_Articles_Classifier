The objective of the film, says the filmmaker, is to make audiences sit up and take notice of corruption in the education system and the irrelevance of its academics-driven nature. \"Vascodigama deals with a rather heavy subject, but we have explored it in a humorous manner, so that it does not become preachy. Yes, we want people to discuss the futility of much of what is taught in our schools and colleges, and maybe even initiate a change, but in doing so we want to entertain them,\" says the filmmaker.\nFor this, he got Kishore, who is known for his more serious powerhouse performances, to slip into a comedy and play a crazy, loud lecturer. Parvathy also is a teacher in the film, and the romance between the lead pair is the central line of the story, with all other issues that Madhu wants to tackle making up for the rest of the tale. Add to that music by Poornachandra Tejaswi and background score by Ajaneesh Loknath (of Ulidavaru Kandanthe and RangiTaranga) and you have a complete package, says Madhu.
