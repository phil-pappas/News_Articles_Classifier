He also won awards for rap/hip hop album of the year and rap/hip hop song of the year. \nNewcomer Lauren Daigle also took home three awards, including new artist, song of the year and pop/contemporary song of the year for her anthem single, \"How Can It Be,\" which she also performed during the show, held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee.
