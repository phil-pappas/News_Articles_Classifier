They were identified as fugitives by U.S. Customs officials in Highgate, Vt., at the time of their arrests and authorities have said they can be extradited to California for previous crimes.\nEvi's arraignment took place in Burlington, Vt. Randy's hearing will take place in St. Albans, 30 miles north.\nThe Quaids initially fled to Canada after missing a court date in California over felony vandalism charges. The couple has been accused of damaging over $5,000 worth of property to a Santa Barbara facility they used to own. They claimed killers were after them, describing them as lawyers and accountants, who allegedly caused late actor Heath Ledger 's death back in 2008, when the actor overdosed on prescription drugs.\nQuaid, 65, and his wife were allowed to stay in Canada beginning in 2011, with Quaid's wife granted Canadian citizenship since her father was born there. Quaid's citizenship request, however, was denied in 2013. He was scheduled for deportation on Oct. 14.\nBack in April, Quaid was also arrested in Canada as the result of an investigation. After pleading with Canadian officials to let him stay with his wife, Quaid was ultimately released on bond.\n  Report: Randy Quaid arrested in Montreal for the second time Seven hurt, one seriously, after Amtrak train accident in Vermont Rapper Scarface arrested after BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta Steve-O ready for 30-Day jail sentence after anti-SeaWorld stunt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:23:55.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
