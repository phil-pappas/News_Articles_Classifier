Landing online via Vevo on Wednesday, October 21, the clip directed by Tim Erem follows the Swedish singer/songwriter as she experiences a very wild night. At the beginning, she looks intoxicated while getting dragged down the stairs by a couple of cops. Later, she dances her way through a convenient store after her car wrecked in the middle of the street. She keeps moving her body while standing in an empty church where she stands next to her supposed bridegroom whom she kills in the end. Co-produced by Mattman and Robin, \"Moments\" is the third single to be lifted off Lo's 2014 debut album \" Queen of the Clouds \". Two previous singles from the record, \"Habits (Stay High)\" and \"Talking Body\", peaked at No. 3 and at No. 12 respectively on Billboard Hot 100. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:40.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
