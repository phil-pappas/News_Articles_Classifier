The first season, co-created by \"Saturday Night Live\" alums Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Seth Meyers, concluded last month but each 30-minute episode is available online through Oct. 23 (at ifc.com/watch-now/).\nIt might be one of the best shows of 2015, and I'm not just saying that as someone who watches and writes about documentaries for a living. Hader has never been more versatile (and in one instance, unrecognizable) and the writing and directing is extremely sharp and knowing.\nEach episode is a parody, taking on well-known documentaries such as 1975's \"Grey Gardens\" (here rendered as \"Sandy Passage\"), 1922's \"Nanook of the North\" (\"Kunuk Uncovered\") or the epic 2013 rock doc \"History of the Eagles\" (\"Gentle & Soft: The Story of the Blue Jean Committee,\" the two-part finale that is a truly brilliant piece of television, both terribly moving and funny).\nEach episode is a close-read, capturing the precise aesthetics -- the look, the format, the approach -- of the documentary it's satirizing, but it's done with serious affection. (Only one episode openly mocks its source material: \"DRONEZ,\" which gives the smug-hipster VICE documentary style a swift kick in the rear.)\n\"I have nothing but good things to say about the series,\" said Jamie Meltzer, a filmmaker who teaches documentary filmmaking at Stanford University. \"There's been a whole subgenre of mockumentaries going back quite a ways, and they are a good way to question the ethics and aesthetics of the documentary form and make audiences more critical viewers, in a good way. The level of detail here is sort of astounding to me. It's an amazing series for a documentary nerd.\"\nBut whereas Christopher Guest's mockumentaries tend to focus on a subculture, \"Documentary Now!\" is deeply investigating how a film's style can inform everything. Armisen gives his least schticky performance in \"The Blue Jean Committee\" episode, as a Chicago meatpacker-turned-1970s-soft-rock-superstar-turned-meatpacker-again, a performance that channels yet another music documentary, 2008's \"Anvil: The Story of Anvil.\"\n\"They're mashing up references,\" said Meltzer, and that's also true of \"Sandy Passage,\" which devolves into a found footage horror movie. The documentary's subjects end up slaughtering the filmmakers, which is wonderfully meta; surely there are people so unhappy with how they've been portrayed in a film, they've contemplated a few horrors of their own.\nEach episode features a PBS-aping intro by Helen Mirren. \"I almost hesitate to say it because I've had a film air on 'Independent Lens,' but what Helen Mirren is doing is the perfect satire of a PBS introduction,\" Meltzer said. \"It made me cringe, it was so perfect. But because it's so perfect, it's totally hilarious.\"\nBut aside from the meticulous mimicry, can we actually learn anything about documentaries by watching the show?\n\"I think so,\" Meltzer said. \"By focusing on all these minute details and getting them right, they're making you question the construction of documentaries and the construction of truth. As someone who studies documentary film history and teaches documentary film production, I want filmmakers thinking about that -- how they're constructing scenes and how they're making the audience more aware that construction (of how the doc is being shot and stitched together). There's manipulation there, but you can make audiences aware.\n\"So I think what a show like this can do, in a pretty serious way, is use satire to send up the conventions of documentaries and make us question them as a reliable source conveying the truth -- which they're really not. They're vehicles for great storytelling that can tell us amazing truths about what it means to be human. But in doing that, there has to be manipulation and the construction of a story.\"\nThe series has already been renewed for two more seasons. \"There's an endless amount of source material,\" Meltzer said. \"The social issues doc and Michael Moore, that is so ripe for satire. Or 'Supersize Me,' that kind of personal documentary.\n\"It would be great if this series sent more people to look at the classic documentaries that they're parodying.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740232&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740232", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740232&h=Why+%27Documentary+Now%21%27+may+be+one+of+the+best+TV+shows+of+2015"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:13:38.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
