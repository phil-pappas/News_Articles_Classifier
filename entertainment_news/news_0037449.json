The show hits every SEC campus during the college football season, this week stopping in Tuscaloosa to kick off coverage prior to the Alabama-Tennessee game, which begins at 2:30 p.m. in Bryant-Denny Stadium. \nSee photos from the \"SEC Nation\" set, as well as Finebaum's radio show set.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:33:56.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
