These variable forms of generation present challenges to the electrical grid, which was designed using a centralized model with predictable power flows. As the percentage of wind and solar PV generation in a given area increases, this variable generation puts stress on the grid and can cause distortions in the energy market and instability on the grid. The first markets to experience this instability are islands and markets with high penetrations of distributed solar PV.\n\nThe growth of variable generation presents opportunities for energy storage systems (ESSs) situated either at the distribution grid or behind the meter. One of the primary drivers of the grid-tied ESS market has been the decreasing cost of advanced batteries. While system costs are still one of the biggest barriers to the industry's growth, declining prices and a flood of new systems integrators are opening up new use cases and geographic markets. According to Navigant Research, global new installed energy storage systems for renewable energy integration (ESRI) power capacity is expected to grow from 196.2 MW in 2015 to 12.7 GW in 2025.\n\nThis Navigant Research report analyzes the global ESRI market, focusing on four primary applications: commercial ESRI, residential ESRI, utility-scale solar integration, and utility-scale wind integration. These four applications include a variety of different functions for an ESS to perform that can facilitate a seamless integration of variable renewable energy generation. The study provides an analysis of the market issues, including business cases, opportunities, and challenges, associated with ESRI. Global market forecasts for capacity and revenue, broken out by application, technology, and region, extend through 2025. The report also examines the key technologies related to ESRI, as well as the competitive landscape.\n\nKey Questions Addressed: \nWhat are the key characteristics of the business case for storage to support renewables integration at the residential, commercial, and utility-scale levels? \nWhat is the impact of curtailed wind on the business case for utility-scale wind integration?\nHow large is the energy storage for renewables integration (ESRI) market in terms of megawatts and revenue?\nWho are the key players in the ESRI market?\nHow fast will the ESRI market grow and what are the key demand drivers?\n\nWho needs this report? \nEnergy storage technology vendors and service providers\nWind energy equipment manufacturers, project developers, and plant operators\nSolar PV equipment manufacturers, project developers, and plant operators\nPower system suppliers and major electronics firms\nEnergy storage/battery component suppliers\nUtilities and grid operators\nGovernment agencies\nInvestor community\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3312690/ \n\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com For more information: \nSarah Smith \nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com \nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com  \nTel: +44 208 816 85 48 \nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com \n\nSOURCE ReportBuyer\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:51:28.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
