(AP) - A university in northeastern Pennsylvania has become the latest school to rescind an honorary degree it granted Bill Cosby.\nA spokeswoman for Wilkes University said Thursday that it's never rescinded an honorary degree before.\nThe school says university trustees voted unanimously Oct. 2 to revoke the honorary doctorate of humane letters it granted Cosby in 2004.\nIt gave Cosby the degree in recognition of his achievements in education and entertainment and for his activism for social justice and civil rights.\nBut the university says it's become clear Cosby's conduct doesn't live up to those values, or to the school's.\nCourt documents unsealed in July show Cosby admitting in 2005 to carrying on extramarital relationships with several women, including some who accuse him of sexual assault. He's never been charged with a crime.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:11:44.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
