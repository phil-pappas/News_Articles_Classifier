(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) Sponsored Links The Associated Press BOSTON â€” \nThe lawyer for a woman who's accused Bill Cosby of sexually abusing her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 says she'll seek a second deposition of the comedian. \nLawyer Gloria Allred said Saturday that Cosby appeared for a deposition in Boston on Friday that lasted several hours. Allred represents Judy Huth, who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him in the 1970s. \nAllred says Huth will be deposed on Thursday. She says a California judge will decide in December if the testimony will be made public. \nLawyers for the 78-year-old Cosby say Huth's lawsuit is frivolous and that Huth's former attorney attempted to extort Cosby. \nCosby also faces two other cases: a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a suit filed Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her.
