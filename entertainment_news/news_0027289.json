This is his second album and although his first was in any case, pretty decent, the sophomore outing shows a progression in terms of his overall sound. McPherson doesn't mix the blues or any else with his straight-ahead brand of rock n roll and music, in order to not dilute the raw power of this kind of music. Incidentally, there is also a strong rockabilly influence here, thanks to his Carl Perkins influence, who was a pioneer in that genre. Pay attention to the bass line in the title track, which any pure rock and roll aficionado will praise for its purity. A close parallel can be the bass that Herbie Flowers plays on Harry Nilsson's Jump Into The Fire. Other strong tracks on the album include Gentle Awakening, Scratching Circles and Signs and Signifiers. And while the vocals are pretty good, the instrumental Mother Of Lies is pretty enjoyable; it's probably something you'll want to hit the repeat button for. Listened to from start to finish, the album sound uniform enough to not throw a curveball at a listener, yet with plenty of sonic surprises to keep your interest engaged. While not a guitar virtuoso in the way someone like say, Stevie Ray Vaughan (who tragically passed away much before his time in a helicopter accident) it is pretty clear that McPherson taps into that same line of 50s swing.
