His findings, he says, will comfort the dying, convince many skeptics, and help relatives and friends who have lost loved ones.\nCHICAGO , Oct. 13, When Connie Calderone was in a deep coma following a traffic accident in 1990 in Chicago , she met her best friend's deceased daughter, Jessica LaCoppola , whom she barely knew.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276115\nIn Connie's near-death experience, Jessica told her she was getting everything ready to receive one of her own close relatives who would soon die.\nConnie eventually recovered. Six months later, the prophecy came true. One of Jessica's perfectly healthy relatives had died.\nAll three were patients of Dr. Louis Villalba , a Chicago neurologist who found himself in the middle of a bizarre series of eerie events that spanned 13 years–all interconnected to the afterlife and the prophecy.\nA professor of neurology and author of 73 scientific papers and book chapters, Villalba relates this true story in his new book \" Afterlife Tracks, Glimpses of the Occult .\" It narrates a series of paranormal incidents in Chicago , where he had a thriving neurology practice.\nAll the protagonists of the story, members of two Italian-American families, filed through his office for more than a decade, unveiling their lives as he juggled the roles of healer and friend. Villalba describes his own paranormal experience at the wake in front of the corpse. \"I felt as if a new dimension had opened its door for me to peek into,\" Villalba writes. \"Apparently, the window to this other world was there, displayed before everyone's eyes at the chapel.\"\nThe book has won praise from reviewers:\n\"His philosophy of life comes through very strongly and makes the book very appealing. So much so, as a matter of fact, that I would recommend many in his profession read this to see what it's all about.\"\n-- Professor Donald Cassiday of North Park University in Chicago\n\"It's a wonderful book, which tells excellent stories, as well as conveying strong spiritual meaning, in the very best sense.\"\n–Professor Fred Shafer of Northwestern University in Evanston, IL\nVillalba knew from his studies that Connie's comatose brain couldn't dream or support a complex vision with such detailed scenes and an accurate memory of the occurrence.\n\"For the first time in a #neardeath experience, a prophecy was issued that came to pass,\" he says. \"This is why I decided to research these events, using my knowledge of the workings of the normal and abnormal brain. My #paranormal experience did not influence my judgment. I needed to reach a conclusion based on facts and neurophysiological knowledge. But the event did spur my scientific curiosity about the existence of the #afterlife even more.\"\nVillalba wrote the book because his findings will comfort the dying, convince many skeptics, and help relatives and friends who have lost loved ones.\n\"Afterlife Tracks, Glimpses of the Occult\" (ISBN 1514611503, Createspace, 2015) can be purchased on Amazon ( $10.99 hardcover and $4.99 Kindle) at http://www.amazon.com/Afterlife-Tracks-Glimpses-Louis-Villalba/dp/1514611503 .
