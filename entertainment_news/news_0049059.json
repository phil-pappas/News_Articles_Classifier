The official provided the name on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The Umpqua Community College killer, identified as Chris Harper Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. The gunman died following a shootout with police. Police were not saying whether they knew of any motive.\nMercer lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester, where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would be released later, he said.\nMercer's step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn't make sense.\n\"All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,\" she told KCBS-TV.\nSocial profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings.\nThere didn't seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends.\nIn addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account and a blog.\nOn a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development.\nA MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle.\nMercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as uncommunicative.\nBefore the Roseburg shooting, a posting on the message-board site 4chan included a photo of a crudely drawn frog used regularly in Internet memes with a gun and warned other users not to go to school Thursday in the Northwest.\nThe messages that followed spoke of mass shootings, with some egging on and even offering tips to the original poster. It was unclear if the messages were tied to the shooting because of the largely anonymous nature of the site.\nInvestigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter's apartment seeking clues, Hanlin said Friday.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/75/8724313/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/51/8727110/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/53/8727232/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/74/8724229/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/10/8725002/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:36:55.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
