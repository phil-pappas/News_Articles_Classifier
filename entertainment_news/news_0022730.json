Students say Principal Deni Christensen notified them Monday that the school had declined the prize because some parents said that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis support alcohol and drug use and misogyny in their music.\nChristensen has not yet returned calls for comment.\nQuinn Darling, Aliso Niguel Associated Student Body vice president, used social media to push his classmates to enter the contest on Sept. 22, a day before it was set to finish. Darling and his friends took to social media again Monday to protest.\nStudents of Aliso Niguel High School. As you already know, our school received the most votes and won a visit from @macklemore and @ryanlewis along with a $10,000 grant to our fine arts programs at Aliso. Sadly, due to the complaints of a few parents of Aliso Niguel students, who claim that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are figures who promote drug use and misogyny, our Principaland Administration have decided to decline the visit and music grant. This decision was made regardless of the hour ASB spent debating and countering our Principal's claims. With all due respect, I believe admin has made a huge mistake. I am personally offended by their decision as it is based off outdated evidence and our leaders have failed to see all the amazing movements and messages these artists have focused on spreading over the past few years which would be beneficial to every student at our school. Most significant being a Gay-Rights movement and also many Anti-Drug messages. I am here to say our voice matters and we have been robbed of this amazing opportunity. I encourage you to repost this message or Respectfully share your own thoughts and work with us to spread a movement of Students speaking out for what is fair and just. #bringbackmack\nA photo posted by Quinn Darling (@quinndarling) onOct 12, 2015 at 7:06pm PDT\nA petition to reverse the decision on change.org was posted at 8 p.m. Monday and had garnered 2,750 signatures by early Tuesday morning.\n“The one thing my peers, our parents and I want to convey is that we deserve a fair say in these decisions,” Darling said. “The ultimate decision was never publicized to parents or us, so even though six or however many parents who were initially against (the visit), there are maybe 300 parents who would’ve supported it.”\nAnother Aliso Niguel student shared one of Darling’s comments via Twitter, to which Macklemore responded.\nThat's disappointing https://t.co/5ju1Nl8nqt\n— Macklemore (@macklemore) October 13, 2015 Quinn said the Associated Student Body had picked a date for Macklemore and Ryan Lewis to visit, Dec. 17, and were already planning how to utilize the school’s gym to allow the greatest number of students to participate in the question and answer session with the musicians.\nContact the writer: 949-667-1933, cyee@ocregister.com and @ChrisMYee on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/macklemore/status/653802025272999937", "https://t.co/5ju1Nl8nqt", "https://instagram.com/p/8wqnIFlvF9/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:32:35.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
