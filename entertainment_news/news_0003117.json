I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.\" \nTo emphasize the point, he later states, \" If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\" \nCraig doesn't care who replaces him as 007, either. He says, \"Look, I don’t give a f***. Good luck to them!\" \n\"All I care about is that if I stop doing these things we’ve left it in a good place and people pick it up and make it better,\" he continues. \"Make it better, that’s all.\" \nCraig does have some advice for any actor who's offered the chance to become the next James Bond: \"Firstly, it’s your decision. Don’t listen to anybody else. Well, do listen to everybody, but you have to make the choice at the end of the day. It’s your bed to lie on. \n\"And don’t be s***!\" he warns. \" Don’t be s*** . You’ve got to step up. People do not make movies like this anymore. This is really rare now. So don’t be s***.\" \nCraig has played Bond in four movies, including Spectre , which opens November 6. \nCopyright © 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:35:04.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
