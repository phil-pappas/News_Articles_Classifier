By Cassidee Moser \nIn an effort to create a more \"cohesive\" and \"immersive\" story, Hasbro will be uniting the universes shared by the Transformers toys and other entertainment media. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter , company executives are planning to create a multi-year narrative shared by virtually all aspects of the Transformers property called The Prime Wars Trilogy. \nThis trilogy is currently being explored through the toys, Machinima digital series, and licensed video games, and working with this shared story arc is intended to provide a unified \"framework\" for the franchise. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \nAs for film, Hasbro is currently working with Paramount to create a similar unification unfolding over the next ten years. \nThe IDW-published comics, digital series, and video games are currently in the midst of a storyline called The Combiner Wars. Once The Combiner Wars Wraps in summer 2016, the second part of the trilogy - called Titan's Return - will launch shortly after in fall 2016. \nOnce Titan's Return has reached its conclusion, the final part of the trilogy is expected to end sometime in late 2017 to early 2018. Throughout this arc, fan favorites such as Sentinel Prime and the robots who transform larger robots seen back in the '80s. It's also likely the two new female transformers Windblade and Victorion will be highlighted throughout. \nRead IGN's review of Transformers: Devastation to learn more about wrecking shop as a robot in disguise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:44:19.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
