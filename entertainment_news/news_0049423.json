Church was an emerging artist in 2007 and played an afternoon set on the Mane Stage before returning to headline in 2014. Underwood was the penultimate act in 2008 and then topped the bill in 2011. Bryan, like Church, started as an emerging artist with an early time slot in 2008 before moving up to a later afternoon set in 2012 and he finally headlined in 2014.\nChurch will headline Friday, April 29. Also performing that day are Young, Harris, Sam Hunt, Eric Paslay, Marty Stuart, Robert Earl Keen, Jana Kramer, Lucero, Kristian Bush, Billy Joe Shaver, Whitey Morgan, Dale Watson, Drake White and the Big Fire, The Malpass Brothers, Cody Jinks, Carl Anderson, Tigerman Woah!, Haley Georgia and Leroy Powell.\nPHOTOS: Stagecoach Country Music Festival through the years\nUnderwood will top the bill on Saturday, April 30.

In recent years, Stagecoach has also brought more classic rock into the fold, with artists such as ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd and George Thorogood attracting throngs of fans to the airplane hangar-sized Palomino Stage. This year, John Fogerty, The Doobie Brothers and the Marshall Tucker Band fill the classic rock niche.\nVisit stagecoachfestival.com for passes and more information.\nContact the writer: vfranko@pe.com or @vanessafranko on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://stagecoachfestival.com/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:34:16.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
