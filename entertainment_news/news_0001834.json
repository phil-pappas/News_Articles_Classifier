In response to LEGO's refusal and the overwhelming public response, Ai Weiwei has now decided to make a new work to defend freedom of speech and 'political art'. Ai Weiwei Studio will announce the project description and LEGO collection points in different cities,\" the post said.\nAi has previously used LEGO bricks to build portraits of 175 well-known prisoners of conscience such as Nelson Mandela, shown on the U.S. prison island of Alcatraz.\n\"As a company dedicated to delivering great creative play experiences to children, we refrain - on a global level - from actively engaging in or endorsing the use of LEGO bricks in projects or contexts of a political agenda. This principle is not new,\" LEGO said in a statement.\n\"Any individual person can naturally purchase LEGO bricks through normal sales channels or get access to LEGO bricks in other ways to create their LEGO projects if they desire to do so, but as a company, we choose to refrain from actively engaging in these activities,\" the company said.\n(Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki ; Editing by Richard Balmforth )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:52:11.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
