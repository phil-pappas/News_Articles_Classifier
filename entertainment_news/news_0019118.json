They let the twisted reality slowly bleed into the movie and grow ever spookier, rather than whisking the curtain away all at once. It’s a nice approach that only adds to the creepiness.\nAnd this film is supremely creepy, despite its spare setting and bare-bones cast. It mostly takes place in an ultra-modern house in a remote Austrian forest-and-corn-fields landscape that feels almost otherworldly. The story revolves around 9-year-old twin boys, Elias and Lukas (Elias and Lukas Schwarz). Elias and Lukas play 9-year-old sorts of games — hiding from one another in a corn field, swimming in a lake, generally reveling in their isolation.\nThen their mother (Susanne Wuest) comes home, her head and face covered in bandages. She has apparently had plastic surgery and needs rest. The boys are not supposed to bother her. We can see she’s uptight — she’s short with Elias and hardly acknowledges Lukas — and with her swath of white gauze, she looks like some wounded soldier drifting about the house.\nEventually, the boys start to suspect the person beneath the bandages is not really their mother. Then they start imagining ways to get the truth out of this impostor to find out what she’s done with their mother. The directors juggle the boys’ thoughts and actions, mixing dreams or dark intent with reality, keeping the audience tense and off balance.\nThe tension never lets up. By its end “Goodnight Mommy” has sapped all strength out of the viewer and the power of self-preserving delusion has conquered and destroyed all. It’s not what you’d call an upbeat film, but it is a darn effective one.\ntlong@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/toomuchTomLong \n\n‘Goodnight Mommy’ \nGRADE: B+ \nRated R for disturbing violent content and some nudity\nRunning time: 99 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:20:40.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
