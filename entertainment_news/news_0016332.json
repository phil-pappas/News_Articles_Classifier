Click here for the live streaming link . Barcelona are without the services of Lionel Messi but still look good to get three points on the board. \nThe biggest blow that Barcelona have received in recent weeks is Lionel Messi missing out for a month. The danger is far from over for the home side, who will be facing Luis Suarez and a rampaging Neymar, who is coming into the game after scoring four goals in a single game. Barcleonaâ€™s league form has been slightly erratic compared to the heights that they reached last season. Even in the Champions League, the defending champions had to see out a draw and will have a stern test on their hands to top the group. \nBate have already showed that they can upset opponents and that is exactly what they did against AS Roma in the earlier matchweek. They competed well against Bayern Leverkusen as well and they have been in good form. Can they stage an upset with a packed house supporting them? BATE were thrashed four years ago in both legs when they faced Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League \nPredicted Squads \nBarcelona Ter Stegen, Alves, Pique, Mascherano, Alba; Busquests, Rakitic, Segi; Neymar, Suarez, Munir El Haddadi \nBate Borisov Chemik, Olekhnovich, Polyakov, Milunovic, Mladenovic; Alekseivech, Nicolic, Volodko, Stasevic; Gordeichuk, Signevich \nModified Date: October 21, 2015 12:15 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:37:04.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
