Music directors Arindam Chatterjee and Indraadip Das Gupta can't stop smiling from ear to ear.\nIn fact, there are three versions of the romantic number, Egiye de, in the soundtrack. While the male version is sung by Arijit Singh, Somlata has rendered the female version. \"The duet sung by Arijit and debutante Madhubanti is already rocking the charts. I was told it garnered huge hits within a day of its release,\" said its composer, Arindam. Madhubanti was among the many chorus singers in Arindam's previous movie, Bojhena Shey Bojhena . \"I loved her voice and called her again while composing for this movie,\" he said. The songs, said Arindam, are in keeping with the film's romantic theme. \"There's yet another song, Jeno tomari kachhe, which exudes Bangaliana. It's sung by Ash King and Somlata. That apart, there are two other peppy tracks -Emotional saiyan and Bou bou. While Arijit, Shalmali Kholgade and Kenyan rapper Bob have sung the first one, Ash King and Prashmita lent their voices to the latter. All the songs are written by Prosen,\" he said.\nIndraadip, who has composed the background score and the title track of the film starring Dev, Soham, Mimi Chakraborty and Srabanti, said he's looking forward to the release of his song. The composer, who shares a long association with Arijit, said the singer recorded his part in between concerts in the US. \"That apart, I've dubbed Shreya Ghoshal and Papon for the song in Mumbai. Birsa, Prosen, Shrikant (Mohta) and I wanted to give the audience a taste of something new and that's how Shudhu tomari jonyo , the song, happened. The music is both for the classes and masses,\" he said. Ash King, in town for a day , said he's thoroughly enjoying the experience called Shudhu Tomari Jonyo . \"Three years back, I had sung Kothin tomake chhara ekdin for Bojhena Shey Bojhena . It was a runaway hit. And here I am singing two more songs. I'm hoping the audience would fall in love with the music.\"\nShudhu Tomari Jonyo , produced by Shree Venkatesh Films, releases on October 16.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:25:06.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
