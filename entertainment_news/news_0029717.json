Consider these lines from an interview with the Red Bulletin : Upon being asked what someone could learn from James Bond that would be helpful in daily life: Craig thought for a minute, then replied, \"Nothing.\" But surely there must be something...: \"Let’s not talk these films up as some kind of life-changing experience.\" On the question of how important Bond's physique is to the films: \"It’s an aesthetic choice. My female producer always makes sure I take off my shirt often enough.\" Upon being asked if he thinks Bond is a positive role model: He noted, \"My own role models are people who have a moral compass,\" then went on to discuss Pablo Picasso and Francis Bacon, without mentioning Bond at all. On Bond's appeal to women: \"But let’s not forget that he’s actually a misogynist.\" And then, as Gawker notes, there was Craig's interview Thursday on ITV's This Morning , when the interviewer asked him to do a \"signature Daniel Craig pout.\" Craig seemed to have no idea what she was talking about, and finally ended that line of questioning with, \"I think you need to move on.\" (Another famous Daniel gave a much better interview this week .) In this Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2014 file photo, Daniel Craig jokingly gestures to photographers as he films a scene for the new James Bond film, \"Spectre,\" in London.
