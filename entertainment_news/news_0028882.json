There are four different tracks in the film. Her track is different from mine. Similarly, Shahid and Diljit Dosanjh will have their own track,” Alia told IANS.\n“Udta Punjab”, which is currently under production, will be the first time when Alia will star alongside another actress in a film.\nAsked whether she feels competitive in Bollywood, the daughter of filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and yesteryear actress Soni Razdan, said: “Competition is inevitable in life. But I don't think that one should pay too much attention to what all is happening around. We are all happy people doing good work and just proud and happy for each other, in fact.”\nSo does she feel any pressure being a star kid?\nAlia said: “When I made my debut, I didn't make it in my family production. So it has nothing to do whether I come from a film background or not. Secondly, my expectations and pressure that I feel is to please the people who watch and appreciate my work.\"\n\"I just wish to please them (audience) and keep them happy. I try and hope to do as many versatile characters as I can.”\nAlia started her career with \"Student Of The Year\" and has since impressed cine-goers with \"Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania\", \"2 States\" and \"Highway\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:51:12.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
