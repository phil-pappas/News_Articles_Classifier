It would be another six years before Hamdi's nephew, Osama Ahmed Fahmy, sued Mosley and Jay Z for copyright infringement. Fahmy also asserts the raunchy lyrics of \"Big Pimpin'\" violate the \"moral rights\" of his uncle's work, although that legal concept is enforceable only in Egypt and Jay Z's lyrics are not an issue in the case.\nToward the end of his testimony Wednesday, Mosley told jurors his reaction to Fahmy's lawsuit when it emerged so many years after \"Big Pimpin'\" was created: \"So, who did I pay 100 grand to?\"\nPaying other artists to sample their work is commonplace, especially in the rap and hip-hop genres.\nMosley's payment is how the system should work, said Jonathan Steinsapir, an intellectual property lawyer with the firm Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert.\n\"It sure seems like Jay Z, Timabaland and their legal team in good faith thought they had a license,\" he said. \"They were doing what we want people to do.\"\nHe added, \"That's not an insignificant fee at all,\" Steinsapir said. \"That's a big fee. They paid it.\"\nJay Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, also said he believed they had all the appropriate rights for \"Big Pimpin'.\"\n\"We have the rights as you can see on the bottom of the CD,\" Carter testified Wednesday, referencing liner notes that credit \"Khosara Khosara.\"\nWhether jurors will see the claim in such simple terms remains to be seen.\nTrials over song copyrights are rare, yet the \"Big Pimpin'\" case is the second major case to get argued to a jury in Los Angeles this year. In March, a jury awarded Marvin Gaye's children $7.4 million from Pharrell and Robin Thicke after determining their 2013 hit, \"Blurred Lines\" copied Gaye's hit \"Got to Give It Up.\"\nA judge later trimmed the verdict to $5.3 million, but the case remains mired in post-trial motions and will likely face years of appeals.\nThe cases are different. While there's no dispute that \"Khosara Khosara\" is sampled on the Jay Z song, Pharrell denied he copied Gaye's music. He acknowledged he was influenced by Gaye's music and trying to recreate its feel, but said he didn't copy it outright.\nOn Friday, a defense music expert testified that in his opinion the \"Khosara Khosara\" notes included on \"Big Pimpin'\" were not an essential element of the song despite their repetition throughout. Fahmy's expert, however, told jurors early in the trial that Hamdi's notes are a significant part of \"Big Pimpin',\" and moreover they would be instantly recognizable to an Egyptian audience.\n\"They light up because they're lively,\" said Scott Marcus, a professor of ethnomusicology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has studied Arab music extensively.\nNo matter the verdict, the case won't be the last one musicians face when their hit songs share elements with other music - whether they're licensed or not. But Steinsapir said the case could have implications for future sampling claims, which are already pricey.\n\"It makes the costs of making hip hop music and other related music go up considerably,\" Steinsapir said. \"There are whole genres of music that are priced out.\"\nRelated Stories Jay Z tells jury he believes he has licence for Egyptian music used in his hit 'Big Pimpin' Jay Z attends start of copyright infringement trial over hit 'Big Pimpin'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:49:59.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
