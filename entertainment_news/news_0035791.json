The world was being ravaged by the World War II, and India was struggling for Independence. In these times of conflict, the Hindi film industry was finding its own feet and people, their own identity.\nBut amongst all this and despite it, two lovers were weaving their own dreams, only to watch it tatter in front of their eyes. It's a story of love born in the times of strife, shaken by a tragic twist of fate and event, later to be re-united in memory, nostalgia and a chance meeting.\nThe play is written by Ramu Ramanathan and directed by Deepak Dhamija, while the artistes include Puneet Sikka and Tarun Singhal.\nIt is scheduled to take place on October 25 (3 and 6.30 pm) at Jagriti Theatre, Whitefield, Ramagondanahalli, Varthur Road.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:24:01.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
