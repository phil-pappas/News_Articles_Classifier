It's lovely to work with him. He can have good chemistry with anybody because he's such a good actor. Unfortunately, in 'Talvar', we didn't have too many scenes together,\" Konkona said here.Konkona and Irrfan shared a wonderful chemistry in \"Life in a...Metro\". Subsequently, they acted in \"Dil Kabaddi\" and \"Right Yaa Wrong\".Most of Konkona's scenes in \"Talvar\" are with Neeraj Kabi.Talking about working with him, Konkona said: \"He too is a fantastic actor. In 'Ship Of Theseus', he was the monk, and he's very good. So it was very enjoyable getting to work with him and to know him as an actor.\"Besides that, working in \"Talvar\" -- a project penned by Vishal Bhardwaj and directed by Meghna Gulzar -- itself was a powerful experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:20:14.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
