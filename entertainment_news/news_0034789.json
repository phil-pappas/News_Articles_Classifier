Without unity, we are bound to fail,\" he said. \nMr Mwatsahu said they were currently strengthening JAP before they could conduct party elections adding that they want to involve all tribes in the county. \n\"We need time to build up JAP and make it inclusive to all tribes. We want genuine membership and not those with intentions to destroy it. We are recruiting members before conducting our elections,\" Mwatsahu explained.
