It should make people feel like it's their festival,\" Zoya Akhtar told IANS. On her appointment as the newest board member, she said she didn't need to be convinced.\n updates,\n\"I really love movies. I don't think there's a better reason than this to be part of a film festival. It makes sense to be part of such an initiative that creates the culture to look at cinema beyond stars and box-office numbers,\" she said, adding that she still considers herself a passionate patron of the festival, which has an eclectic line-up of over 150 films this year. \"Whenever I've been in town during the festival, I've made it a point to attend it,\" she said.\nContrary to the notion that the film fraternity's active involvement in the festival may lead to differences, Zoya thinks otherwise. \"The purpose of a group is to have varied opinions about something. No matter whoever you put in a group, there's bound to be differences. I think that's what makes everything so interesting,\" she said\n\"I mean, what's the fun when everybody agrees on the same thing. In that case, one person is all you need to make decisions. Why do you need a group,\" she asked. Filmmaker Hansal Mehta's Aligarh will be the opening film of the festival and it's the second Indian film to get such an honour after Govind Nihalani's Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa in 1997.\nZoya is elated that an Indian film will open the fest. \"It's great to have an Indian film as the opening feature. I mean, it's our fest, organized by our people and it's happening in the country. Why shouldn't an Indian film open the fest,\" she asked.\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\n updates, follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nThis year, audiences will get a chance to watch 31 Indian films that have never been shown before in India.

This is what I like about film festivals. They are not just about watching movies. Agreed, you get to watch films that may never come to India, but you have this platform to exchange knowledge and ideas,\" she said.\nListen to Dil Dhadakne Do songs on Gaana.com\nClick here for more Bollywood videos\nWATCH: Shocking!
