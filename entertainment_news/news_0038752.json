(\"AHIT\" or the \"Company\") (OTCBB: AHIT) announced that it will be featured on Designing Spaces®, a half-hour-long national home improvement show on Lifetime® Television. The program plans to integrate American Housing Income Trust, Inc., into a segment entitled: \"Home Is Where The Heart Is…Why Renting Is So Attractive\". The segment will be filmed in October 2015 and will air nationally beginning in Q1, 2016. The segment will also air an additional 75 times in broadcast syndication across 75 stations around the country.\nJeff Howard , President and Chief Executive Officer of American Housing Income Trust Inc commented, \"Home ownership, long considered a pillar of the American Dream, is increasingly elusive for many. With escalating real estate prices and constraints on credit availability, a growing number of individuals and families cannot afford to purchase a decent home convenient to their job or in a desirable school system.\"\nArizona -based American Housing Income Trust, Inc. fills this vital housing need by buying homes in neighborhoods that have top-rated schools, low crime, and access to amenities and transportation, and restoring these homes to make them highly desirable to its potential residents.\nMr. Zarinegar further stated, \"We are very excited that American Housing was selected as the premier housing REIT to be featured on this nationally syndicated program. We look forward to showing viewers how our Company adds value to home renters in America.\" This national brand reaching out to our company further validates our model of single-family rentals and proof positive we are on the right track within this rapidly growing Single Family Rental (SFR) space.\n\"With the specter of rising interest rates and tighter mortgage standards, we believe the demand for rental housing will grow – not as a transitional, substandard or second-class option, but as a sought-after alternative to the financial and often inflexible demands of home ownership,\" adds Sean Zarinegar, AHIT Board of Directors.\n\"As an emerging asset class in the public markets, this sector is just in its infancy and has vast opportunity to grow,\" Zarinegar says. \"One out of eight single-family homes is a rental property, and that equates to about 14 million homes with a real estate value of approximately $2.7 trillion . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, home ownership has steadily declined from 69 percent in 2005 to around 64 percent currently. Each 1 percent decline in homeownership creates the need for an additional 1 million rental homes.\"\n\"The benefits for our shareholders include cash flow and home price appreciation. For our residents, the advantages are access to affordable and attractive housing and improved quality of life. It's a win-win for everyone.\"\nAbout American Housing Income Trust, Inc.\nAmerican Housing Income Trust Inc., is incorporated in the State of Maryland owns and operates single family rentals in Arizona , Nevada and Texas and has plans to scale it's operations nationally.
