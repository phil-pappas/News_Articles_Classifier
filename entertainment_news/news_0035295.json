The movie's official Instagram account announced that the actor would portray Jason a.k.a. the Red Ranger, joining Naomi Scott who would play Kimberly a.k.a. the Pink Ranger. It's a bit surprising that Montgomery has been cast as the Red Ranger since his name did not appear on the recently-rumored \"Power Rangers\" shortlist. KJ Apa (\"Shortland Street\"), Austin Butler (\" The Shannara Chronicles \") and Mitchell Hope (\" The Descendants \") were in contention for Jason, but they apparently lost the role to Montgomery. A photo posted by Power Rangers (@powerrangersmovie) on Oct 20, 2015 at 3:46pm PDT The upcoming movie is described as a modern reinvention of the long-running franchise. It is based on '90s TV series, \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", in which a group of ordinary high school kids, who possess extraterrestrial powers, join forces to save the world with the aid of giant mechanical vehicles known as Zords. Dean Israelite is attached to direct \"Power Rangers\" with the script written by Zack Stentz and Ashley Miller. Haim Saban, Brian Casentini and Allison Shearmur will produce the movie which is due to hit U.S. theaters on January 13, 2017. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Power Rangers News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:40:34.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
