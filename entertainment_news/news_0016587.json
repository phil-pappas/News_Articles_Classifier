I start great. It’s the stopping I need to work on.” Recently, Offerman, star of the television show “Parks and Recreation,” had a fitting for the fat suit he will wear as Ignatius J. Reilly, the larger-than-life character on a comic odyssey through the streets of New Orleans in the early 1960s. “I came into a fitting for my fat suit and burst into tears,” said Offerman, who won a Television Critics Association Award for Achievement in Comedy in 2011. “I was accosted by five ladies with measuring tapes. The tears were joyful I should say.” Offerman has a deadpan gift for making people laugh, but so too does Jeffrey Hatcher, who spent six years adapting the 1981 Pulitzer prize-winning novel for the stage. With its raft of bizarre characters and its multitude of episodes, the picaresque novel naturally resists being shaped into a two-hour comedy. Asked how he approached it, Hatcher began with, “First, you read the book.” More seriously, he said, “You don’t want to tame the spirit, but you have to wrestle with it. I emphasize the mother-son relationship and the sequence of events that got him to leave New Orleans... To get to the next step, he has to leave the city.” Similarly, author Peter Kennedy O’Toole had a mother very much involved in his life. After he committed suicide at age 31 in 1969, his mother devoted herself to finding a publisher for his repeatedly rejected novel, finally triumphing when author Walker Percy brought it to the attention of the Louisiana State University press. In transforming the novel into a new form, Hatcher and the Huntington Theatre have succeeded over many screenwriters and film companies, who failed despite years of attempts to turn the 1964 novel into a movie. The play last year had a staged reading for the theater industry, starring Offerman, with the hope that it will eventually open on Broadway. Wearing jeans, boots, a plaid short-sleeve shirt and white long-sleeved underwear, Offerman looked like the distant, masculine figure known to his fans – parks and recreation director Ron Swanson, who has nothing in common with Ignatius other than being unlikable. “Because I was not born cute, I’ve often been cast as a character who is not sympathetic at first glance,” said Offerman, 45, who began his career in Chicago theater. “I love nothing more than playing the bad guy and seeing if I can make the audience love the human inside.” Offerman has sympathy for Ignatius, whom he sees as an extreme version of all of us. “We’re all a muling baby crying for our mother’s teat or wanting someone to move us closer to the fire,” he said. “Socialization is partly learning to bury those emotions and needs and get on with our taxes. “Somebody like Ignatius, unbeknownst to him, wears those needs very much on his sleeve,” continued Offerman, who wore a photo pin of his wife, Broadway actress Megan Mullally. “With every affectation, he’s crying out to be loved and approved, even though he’s a very strange genius and clearly holds himself apart.” Tickets are selling so well that a seventh week was announced yesterday. Director David Esbjornson said some people, such as his mother, don’t get the book, but it has a cult status among its fans. “It’s big and splashy and complicated and crazy,” Esbjornson said. “When I encounter people at a party (and tell them about the play), they just about fall off their chairs. They are so excited.” Theater preview : A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCESPerformed by the Huntington Theatre Company at the BU Theatre, 264 Huntington Ave., Boston, Nov. 11-Dec. 20; huntingtontheatre.org .
