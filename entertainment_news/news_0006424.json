Messages seeking comment were left at Klein’s office. \nHis patients included Elizabeth Taylor, Dolly Parton, Carrie Fisher and others. His medical specialty was the use of injectable drugs such as Botox and Restylane to ease wrinkles and sagging skin. \nKlein treated Jackson for more than 25 years before the pop star’s drug-related death in 2009. Federal drug agents investigating the singer’s prescriptions ultimately cleared Klein. Another doctor, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
