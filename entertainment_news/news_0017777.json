According to Deadline , Theron is eyed to take over the role which was previously intended for Brad Pitt . The book follows an expert CIA op-turned-assassin named Court Gentry who must fight his way across Europe, past special forces teams, in order to save the life of his handler. It is still unknown if there will be any story change if Theron ends up starring in the movie. \" The Immigrant \" helmer James Gray was tapped as director with the plan to direct Pitt. However, Pitt dropped out of the project for some reasons. The script is written by Joe and Anthony Russo, who were also attached as directors before they got busy with \" Captain America: Civil War \", \" Avengers: Infinity War Part I \" and \" Avengers: Infinity War Part II \". If Theron really signs the deal, she will also produce the movie with her Denver and Deliliah label alongside Joe Roth. Previously, there were some gender-swapping movies in Hollywood. The most well-known one is \" Salt \", in which Angelina Jolie replaced Tom Cruise as a CIA officer. Another one is \" Our Brand Is Crisis \", in which Sandra Bullock 's character was originally written as male. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More The Gray Man News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:42:41.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
