He further asserted, “I will quit music, if I would ever plagiarise.” While Amit’s musical genius is universally appreciated, previously too, the musician has found himself in the midst of allegations that his Lootera soundtrack was “inspired” from other sources. In the case of Nazdeekiyan, work on it began a few months after Coldplay’s Oceans was launched in June last year. “See, there are seven musical notes, which are used in the entire world. It’s purely a coincidence that my song is similar to this one. I don’t even know about this song. I will surely listen to Coldplay’s Oceans after this,” Amit said. entertainment Bollywood Amit Trivedi Shaandaar Shahid Kapoor Also Read Watch: The animated version of 'Bajirao Mastani' will enlighten you about history of that era Miley Cyrus hospitalized, cancels Kansas City show Birthday special: Shruti Haasan's gorgeous transformation I want to expect soon: Rani Mukerji on starting a family", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/17AMIT%20TRIVEDI.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151016/entertainment-bollywood/article/not-copycat-amit-trivedi", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/17AMIT%20TRIVEDI.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:01:00.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
