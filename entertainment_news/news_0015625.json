The name change to Nazareth came in 1970 and in 1971 the band moved to London to start what was to become a long and illustrious recording career. \nEven with the passage of time and line-up changes, Nazareth are routinely hailed as that rare thing - pioneers who became legends in their own lifetimes. \n2015 sees them back on the road featuring new singer Carl Sentance (Don Airey (Deep Purple) & Friends, Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath), Krokus, Tokyo Blade and Persian Risk), standing proudly alongside founder member Pete Agnew (bass) and long time band members Jimmy Murrison (guitars) and Lee Agnew (drums).
