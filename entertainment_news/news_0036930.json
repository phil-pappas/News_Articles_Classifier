Choreography by John Neumeier. Through Sunday at the Boston Opera House, 539 Washington St., Boston. $35 and up; bostonballet.org or 617-695-6955. The Boston Ballet opened its 52nd season Thursday night with one of the 20th century’s most monumental ballet-orchestral achievements, the “Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler: A Ballet by John Neumeier.” The adjectives to describe the evening keep running through my head: “glorious,”“awe-inspiring” and “extraordinary” are just a few. And a hearty thank-you goes to the Boston Ballet’s artistic director, Mikko Nissinen, for having the nerve to bring such a gift to Boston. The other hero of the enterprise is Jonathan McPhee, the Boston Ballet’s longtime music director, who conducted the orchestra. John Neumeier, the American-born choreographer who has been based in Germany for the past 40 years, thought to choreograph Mahler’s majestic, all-encompassing, 100-minute masterwork shortly after he assumed the directorship of the Hamburg Ballet in 1973. Two years later, his new company premiered the Mahler ballet to universal acclaim. The score requires a huge orchestra (78 musicians in the Boston Ballet orchestra), chorus (New World Chorale), and a vocal soloist (Sarah Pelletier), along with more than 60 dancers on stage. Since the work is performed without an intermission, few companies have tried it. The Boston Ballet is the first North American company to present the work. Although Neumeier denies having a story in his head for this abstract-style ballet and asks each viewer to bring his or her own experience to the theater, there’s no denying his intention to take us on a journey. As in life, we experience conflicts, fleeting relationships, and a longing for the spiritual and search for a one, true love. On Thursday night, the tall, elegant, expressive Lasha Khozashvili, wearing only flesh-colored tights as if stripped of all vanity or protection, served as the guide to the six movements. The program gives a title to each of these: “Yesterday,”“Summer,”“Autumn,”“Night” (performed in silence by a trio centered by the exceptional solo by Anais Chalendard, supported by Paulo Arrais and Khozashvili). The last two movements feature a child-like “Angel,” cheerfully portrayed by Erica Cornejo, who grows in wisdom and maturity by the finale, “What Love Tells Me.” The ballet opens on a scene of 28 bare-chested men. They are spotlighted on a dark stage, where they hinge over at the hips, their arms spread-eagled and hovering over the floor, as the haunting tones of the orchestra’s brass section welcome us to Neumeier’s vision. The men continue for more than a half-hour, accelerating from the slow tempos into a fast-paced, militaristic marching. One might well wonder what the first German audiences to see the work thought – only 30 years after the end of World War II – while watching the men kick a single leg into the air in a ballet “grand battement” that looks uncomfortably like a goose step, and each hand thump each chest, then fling the arm high in a defiant gesture, a shade close to the Nazi salute? Page 2 of 2 - The men’s section ends in a solo, masterfully performed by Federico Fresi, to repeat and intensify the men’s unison movements into a statement of defiance. Throughout the ballet, but especially in the first section for the men, the lighting, re-created by Ralf Merkel, beautifully molds the bodies and deepens the varying tones of the emotions. The women take over for the next section, dancing in tiny, filigree-like stepping by Dusty Button and Lia Cirio (supported by Eris Nezha and Paul Craig), backed by a corps de ballet winding through the space in lacey patterns. Other dancers featured in ever-changing partnering in the third movement include the glowing Seo Hye Han, lifted by Sabi Varga of Braintree, and Petra Conti and her cavalier, Bradley Schlagheck. Not the least of Neumeier’s satisfying accomplishments in this work is the kaleidoscope of marvelous roles he has created for various dancers, to give many of them an opportunity to take center stage. Although the overall effect depends on the integration of the many into an impressive whole, the individuals stand out to be noticed. The presentation of this work as a program opener marks another milestone in the Boston Ballet’s progress to the top rank of ballet companies the world over.
