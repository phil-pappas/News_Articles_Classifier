More than 60 guitar makers selected from around the country are joined by luthiers from Japan, Sweden and Turkish oud master Faruk Turunz. “The last time he came, Middle Eastern oud players from all over the Northeast were coming to the show just to meet him and see his instruments,” event organizer Baker Rorick said. “All of the Saudi princes have Faruk’s instruments.” An unusual demonstration of 40 stringed instruments from Sones de Mexico’s 80-instrument collection shows the breadth of traditional instruments found in Mexico. The group also will teach a workshop on corrido folk ballads on Sunday at the Kleinert James Arts Center on Tinker Street. Every aspect of lutherie has its own magic, from the delicate engineering to maximize sound vibration to the artistic marquetry, inlay and finishes that inspire, even in silence. A special display of instruments by California designer Ervin Somogyi and those who’ve trained with him will highlight the blend of sound design with beauty in an exhibit on stage at the Bearsville Theater. Somogyi, an expert in voicing soundboards, is completing a marquetry guitar decorated with thousands of individual pieces of wood specifically for this show. Significant examples of antique, historic, vintage and contemporary guitars will be shown next door at the Utopia Soundstage. Selections from the Jeff Doctorow guitar collection form the core of that exhibit. Doctorow, nephew of the late author E.L. Doctorow, has collected guitars for nearly 40 years, which is described in Yale University Press’ book “Guitar Makers: The Endurance of Artisanal Values in North America.” Doctorow wrote his own book about guitar maker Steve Klein of California, whose electric guitars usually end up in the hands of the rock and roll elite. “I’ll bring along seven or eight guitars. Baker likes my harp guitars, but as for the rest, wait and see,” Doctorow said. Some prizes of his 100-instrument collection are The Flying Dream harp sympatar designed by Fred Carlson, a double-wing gold guitar designed by Klein for Steve Miller, and Canadian luthier Linda Manzer’s Pikasso guitar. “Those are the ones with a lot of wow factor. Manzer’s guitar has 42 strings. The first one of those was designed for Pat Metheny. My tastes are off the deep end. No traditional guitars.” This year marks the first time a WILS Traditions Award will be given to musicians who’ve promoted acoustic music. “We’ll honor Happy Traum and John Sebastian with a plaque presentation at a private dinner party on Thursday night to thank them for their incredible support,” Rorick said. Folk icon Traum is hailed by many as the musical mayor of Woodstock, gathering legendary musicians to benefit important local causes. Sebastian, the legendary frontman for The Lovin’ Spoonful in the 1960s best known for his songs “Do You Believe in Magic?” and “What a Day for a Daydream,” is a fellow Woodstock resident and firm advocate of jug bands and folk music. “John? You can’t keep him away. Every year he’s here all day every day and plays every instrument in the room. He knows all the builders and knows as much about making instruments as most of the builders,” Rorick said. Mini-concerts by regional and nationally prominent musicians chosen to demonstrate the guitars of specific builders take place Saturday and Sunday in the lounge area of the Bearsville Theater. This year’s major concert, the String Sampler, brings Jorma Kaukonen of Hot Tuna, Israeli guitarist David Broza and jazz slide guitarist Doug Wamble to the stage Saturday night at the Woodstock Playhouse on Mill Hill Road.
