The premiere was a fitting venue for the protest, as the movie stars Meryl Streep, Helena Bonham Carter and Carey Mulligan as early leaders in the fight for women's suffrage in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nThe film's stars gave their thumbs up to the protest, with Bonham Carter calling it the \"perfect response\" to the theme of the movie.\n\"If you feel strongly enough about something and there's an injustice there you can speak out and try to get something changed,\" she told Sky News.\nTristan Fewings The demonstration lasted for approximately 10 minutes. Mulligan agreed, calling the movement \"awesome\" before adding she was sorry she missed it.\nBritain's conservative government has made stark cuts to its budget for domestic violence services in the last two years, including closing down domestic violence refuge centers across the nation last summer.\n\"With two women killed a week in the U.K. due to domestic violence cuts, there's no way we can stop fighting,\" protester Emma Fischer, 27, told Reuters.\nWILL OLIVER/EPA Romola Garai, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Marie Duff and Carey Mulligan (left to right) are among the stars in \"Suffragette.\" Another member of Tuesday's protest added that they wanted use the premiere to spotlight violence against women.\n\"We're here to say to say that it's great that women's history is being shown in the film, but that the struggle is not over,\" Shanice McBean, 22, added to Reuters.\nRelated Stories Carey Mulligan welcomes first child 'Suffragette’ cast criticized over insensitive slogan", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/07/us-filmfestival-london-suffragette-idUSKCN0S12HZ20151007", "https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/651811650757132288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:04:52.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
