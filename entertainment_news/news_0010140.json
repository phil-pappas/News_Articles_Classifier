The younger group will meet from 5:30-6:30 p.m. and teens will be 6:30-7:30 p.m. There is space for 25-30 kids in each group. \n\"The program will be geared to the skill and talent of those age groups,\" Shuman said. \nParticipants have to be club members. \n\"If a kid would be interested in signing up for this program, they can become a club member and sign up at the same time,\" Shuman said. \nBoth boys and girls have an interest in comic books these days, said Artsbridge Program Coordinator Kathy Reeder. \n\"Our mission is to promote the arts in the community and in the schools,\" she said. \nOfficials with Artsbridge have been talking about doing a comic book class. The willingness of the Boys and Girls Club to be a part of it provided Artsbridge with both participants and a venue to hold the classes, Reeder said. \n\"We want the kids to gain an appreciation of how long it takes to do something like a comic book,\" she said. \"Also, we want them to be able to develop their reading and writing skills. \n\"Anytime we can promote the arts as well as the academic side it is a win-win.\" \nShuman said the kids will be able to hold and look at what they have produced. Organizers also want the kids to look at their own lives to draw inspiration from in doing their comic book, whether it is honoring someone who had an impact on their lives or to explore aspects of their own lives where they would have liked someone, like a superhero, to come in and affect some kind of positive change in their own lives. \n\"They are going to get a finished produced work of their own, professionally printed and they can really be proud of,\" he said. \"Beyond that we want them to look at the possibility of the arts as careers. \n\"We want the kids to understand that with some perseverance, practice and expansion of the talents they already have, they can do something like this and get paid for in the future. This is a career path they could eventually do for themselves.\" Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:38:41.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
