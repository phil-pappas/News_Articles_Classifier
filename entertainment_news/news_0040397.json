The festival also has announced a handful of changes at venues at the June 24 through July 2 event, most notably shifting the Squeezers stage, which last summer played host to roots and Americana acts, from an unsatisfactory location in the Sibley Building to the new and much larger 900-capacity Anthology at 336 East Ave. Those shows will be at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.\nRelive moments from this year: 2015 Jazz Fest .\nWhile Canadian acts have been quite prevalent at the festival, they will be spotlighted in a new series, “Oh, Canada!” Those shows will be at 6 and 10 p.m. at the Rochester Club.\nAlso, Kilbourn Hall show times are set for 6 p.m. and, an hour earlier than past years, 9 p.m. In another change, Kilbourn and Max of Eastman Place will issue wristbands for each show, allowing patrons to not spend as much time waiting in the two most-daunting lines of the festival.\nSingle entry to any show without a three- or nine-day Club Pass has been boosted to $30 cash at the door for all venues except Kilbourn Hall, which will be $35, the first increase for club shows in eight years.\nThe three-day Club Pass, good for 13 venues at any three days of the festival, is $134 plus a $6 service charge, $8 if mailed, until midnight Dec. 31. It then goes up to $154, plus service charge. A limited number of three-day Club Passes will be sold.\nThe nine-day Club Pass is $174 plus a $6 service charge, $8 if mailed, until midnight Dec. 31. Afterward, it increases to $204 plus service charge.\nSeparately ticketed shows at Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre traditionally have been announced as they are confirmed. The entire lineup will be announced in March. Club Passes are available at rochesterjazz.com and (585) 454-2060.
