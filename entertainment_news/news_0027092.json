The gorgeous diva Aishwarya Rai Bachchan who returned back on the big screen after a hiatus of 5 years, has proved to each that she is back with a bang!

From the web-world to the virtual world, Aishwarya has stunned one and all! TAKE A LOOK! Aishwarya Rai Bachchan attends Jazbaa special screening with parents \nA review from the leading Bollywood Critic, Taran Adarsh stated “Aishwarya makes a stunning impact, conveying a gamut of emotions [grief, strong-willed, determined] with aplomb. Finest work so far” \nA review from leading newspaper of India, TOI stated “Aishwarya is rusty at the start but eventually takes charge of the dual aspects of her character. Aishwarya has made a judicious screen choice after that five-year hiatus!” \nA review from leading Bollywood online website Pinkvilla said “Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has chosen her comeback film well. This isn’t a vanity project for her and she adopts her challenging part with such gravitas, well for a large part, that it is hard to believe the actress is emerging fresh from a five-year long hiatus”. \nAnother review from Bollywoodlife.com stated “Clearly the film belongs to Aishwarya. She manages to make Anuradha believable from the very first frame. Even though there are moments when she has to ramp up the drama quotient, screech, scream, show her theatrics, there is a sense of confidence with which she builds up her character. We relate to her pain not only because she’s lost her daughter, but her constant struggle to suspend the very values and beliefs she upholds is what makes Anuradha endearing. Gupta gives her a canvas where she shows a range that perhaps no other director has been able to capture” \nA review from another popular Bollywood news portal, Glamsham.com, stated “Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan coming on screen after GUZAARISH makes a strong statement with her impeccable performance. She balances well the role of a tough lawyer and a mother. It is she and Irrfan Khan who move the story forward. Their intensity catches you off guard and their underlying love nudges at your heart.” \nIf numbers speak more than statements then it is known that Jazbaa has already collected 4.23crs on its day 1 in India the coming days are said to be very strong too. On the overseas front, the response is said to be superb with close to 1 million dirham in just 2 days from Middle East alone!” \n  5:09 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:27:36.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
