After that, I submitted my resignation to my boss Wang Wei-Chung. I told him, ‘I’d like to make some changes. The show is about to turn 12 years old.’ I’d like to thank our colleagues, who have worked very hard. I hope they think it’s been worth it,” Tsai wrote. \nHsu later acknowledged his post on her own Facebook page, saying she would stand with him and that the show would not be complete without him, sparking rumours that the show will therefore end with Tsai’s departure. \nHere Comes Kang Xi, one of Taiwan’s most popular talk shows, has been nominated for numerous Golden Bell Awards since its debut in 2004. Its presenters, Tsai and Hsu, were also awarded Best Host In A Variety Programme at the Golden Bell Awards in 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:08:05.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
