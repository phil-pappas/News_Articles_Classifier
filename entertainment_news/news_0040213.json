The real estate mogul and GOP presidential candidate will host Saturday Night Live November 7. \nIt's not Trump's first time hosting SNL , but it's been a while: he last hosted April 3, 2004. \nWith the man himself in the house, it'll be interesting to see whether Taran Killam and Cecily Strong reprise their roles as Trump and his wife, Melania, which they debuted on the October 3 Saturday Night Live season premiere. \nSinger-songwriter Sia will be the musical guest when Trump hosts. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
