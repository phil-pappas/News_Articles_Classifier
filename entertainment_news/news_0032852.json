You never know what you're gonna get.' I wish people would understand that. Try to stay in the moment, and you won't miss nothin'. If you stay in the moment, you're livin' life to the fullest. Keep your mind open. Don't be prejudiced about nothin'. You try everything.\"\nRead more from Mike Weatherford at reviewjournal.com. Follow him @Mikeweatherford .\n  'Nunsense' returns for a...
