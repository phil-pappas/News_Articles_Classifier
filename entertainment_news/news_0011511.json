Photo: Supplied\nKeeping cubism in the frame\nWhile the basis of Michael Buzacott's constructions is freewheeling and abstract, there is said to be ultimately a figurative rationale to his work. His survey at the ANU Drill Hall Gallery reveals \"how the playful, speculative formalism of post-Caro sculpture can be reconciled with an insistently representational bias\". Buzacott is said to be one of the more inventive and idiosyncratic contemporary sculptors who keeps the language of cubism fresh and vital with his work. The exhibition is on at the ANU Drill Hall until November 1.\nFear of missing out\nMichael Buzacott's Fall of Icarus at the ANU Drill Hall Gallery. Photo: Keith Lo Bue\nJennifer Taylor's paintings are grounded in the practice of painting on-site, \"en plein air\". In Paintings from Arrernte country and Aotearoa Taylor shows a mix of small-scale works completed on the spot in central Australia alongside larger versions made in the studio. In contrast to her works made in Australia, Taylor's paintings from her home country of New Zealand developed from sketches, photographs, and memories of mountains and waterways. \"I grew up in Aotearoa, where one's turangawaewae – place to stand – is the basis for identity, self-respect, and being able to meet others 'eye to eye',\" she says. \"You need to know the mountain, the waterway, and the people you belong to. I am pakeha (non-Indigenous) but these values and the centrality of land, or country, nevertheless shape how I think and see.\"\nAdvertisement Also opening at M16 Artspace is a video installation by Melbourne artist Darcey Bella Arnold exploring the FoMO (fear of missing out) anxiety created by our increasing dependence on social media. In New but Nah she creates collages on Photoshop using Google image searches as a reaction to the fast-paced flow of the internet and the desire to stay continually connected. The images flick past at random on three projectors in the gallery intended to be digested by the viewer as quickly as they were conceived as \"weightless one-liners\" – once the joke is made another one replaces it in an endless feed.\nAnd finally in Desperate Thirst, also at M16, Ellie Windred's series of letterpress works and badges explore vulnerability and desire in the context of casual physical intimacy. Through the use of fonts, metal type, inks and lush paper, Windred formalises elements and themes of modern hook-up culture and encourages assertive female sexuality. All shows are at M16 Artspace, Griffith, from October 8 to 25.\nStill from Darcey Bella Arnold's New but Nah digital collage at M16 Artspace.

Hosted by Wildlife and Botanical Artists Incorporated, the exhibition features more than 90 original artworks inspired by nature from 45 Australian artists. It includes sculptures from Canberra artist Stephen Harrison and watercolours by Newcastle artist Laura Arnull created as part of an artist-in-residence program at Mulligan's Flat Woodland Sanctuary and Jerrabomberra Wetlands Nature Reserve. The two artists were selected from a pool of applicants to spend six weeks working with ecologists, scientists, community volunteers and other artists. The exhibition is on at the Floriade Inspiration Hub until Sunday, October 11, but continues online with works on sale until November 4 at waba.net.au .\nNew arts funds\nEllie Windred's Desperate Thirst letterpress on paper at M16 Artspace. Photo: Supplied\nA community art project for residents of the Ainslie Village, a large scale Indian-inspired tapestry and an exploration of Canberra's rich musical history through music and film are among the projects to be funded by the 2016 ACT Arts Fund. Arts Minister Joy Burch says it's a record year for the fund with 53 artists, arts groups and community organisations sharing close to $730,000, up on 2015 when 49 applicants shared $720,000. The fund is designed to support ACT-based artists' ongoing contribution to the vitality of the arts ecology, through encouraging participation and access to the arts, and producing great art.

Inspired by her love affair with China the works in SPUN explore a fascination with the process of change and emerging beauty. Wright says she has been working with pods and cocoon shape forms for more than 20 years but her most recent works were conceived while living in China and travelling regularly to Japan where she admired the silk-making process. \"Watching the transformation process in nature you often see some form of struggle and yet a profound beauty as well,\" she says. \"I think this is the same for all of us and it's easy to be fascinated by evolving moments in nature and in people as there is usually something exquisite about change.\" SPUN is on at the Nishi Gallery, New Acton, from October 8 to November 1.\nPhoto opportunity\nA mid-career Australian photo-media artist will have the opportunity to make, exhibit and present new work at PhotoAccess and Ainslie and Gorman arts centres in 2016 thanks to the Double Exposure residency. It aims to introduce a mid-career artist living outside the Canberra region to ACT audiences, and to contribute to public awareness of photo-media practice. Priority will be given to artists who work experimentally, or who want to include multi-disciplinary elements in their work, such as performance or installation. The nine-month residency from March includes seven weeks' accommodation at the Gorman Arts Centre ArtSit, a stipend, materials allowance and travel budget of $4860. The artist will also participate in public events during the residency and will have a solo exhibition at PhotoAccess in November 2016. Applications close at 5pm on Wednesday, October 28.
