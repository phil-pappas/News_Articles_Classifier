Strictly Come Dancing’s Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (BBC Pictures) \nOn Sunday, 8.7 million watched the results show for the BBC ballroom extravaganza as celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott became the fourth celebrity to be voted out. \nOver on ITV, an average of 6.5 million (including those watching on ITV +1) watched the climax of X Factor’s Judges’ Houses, which achieved a share of 27 per cent. \nThe singing show broadcast a mixture of pre-recorded and live segments and the figure for fans who viewed just on ITV was 6.12 million. X Factor Sunday ratings so far (PA) \nViewers watched as judges Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw selected their finalists for the live shows. The 24-year-old pop star chose Louisa Johnson, Lauren Murray and Kiera Weathers. \nMeanwhile, BBC Radio 1 DJ Nick selected Che Chesterman, flamboyant Australian Seann Miley Moore and controversial contestant Mason Noise, who had previously been axed from the show. Promoted stories X Factor’s 4th Impact at Judges’ Houses (ITV/Syco) \nOn Saturday, the BBC ballroom show opened up a 3 million gap with an average audience of 9.32 million with a 42.5 per cent share of the total TV audience. \nJudges Simon Cowell and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini selected their finalists for the live shows. Strictly versus The X Factor on Saturday night (PA) \nAn average of 6.35 million viewers watched on ITV as 4th Impact, Alien Uncovered, Reggie n Bollie were selected from Cheryl’s Groups category and Bupsi, Anton Stephans and Max Stone made it through from Simon’s Overs. \nHowever, once those timeshifting on ITV +1 were factored in, the X Factor climbed to 6.7 million viewers. \nBack in August, X Factor supremo Simon had laughed off any talk of a ratings rivalry with Strictly, joking about the lack of a star-studded line-up. \n“This show does feel better, the talent’s great, they’re interesting, so if it’s us versus Peter Andre, I’m going to put my money on us,” he said. Most Watched Shows on Sunday (PA) \nThe loss to Strictly once again in the ratings will not be eased by Countryfile out-rating Sunday’s edition of X Factor; the BBC One magazine show drew 7 million, its best performance since March. \nIn addition, live Judges’ Houses scuppered the previously upward trend of X Factor’s Sunday ratings. \nOn August 30, the ITV singing show’s first Sunday broadcast aired to an average of only 5.94m viewers (not including fans watching via timeshift on ITV +1). \nIn an attempt to avoid the two series clashing, ITV published episode times for X Factor right up until the final in December.
