For it to stay up there for however long it does -- I don’t know how long they plan on keeping it up there -- it will be cool.\n“It’s fun. But I’m not focused on a home run ball. I’m focused on our next series, just being able to get our bodies right.”\nSchwarber said he doesn’t often watch where home run balls land, so he didn’t know what had happened to his ball until later that night.\n“Once you hit it, and you know it’s gone, you watch it for a little bit, and then you just put your head down and start running,” Schwarber said. “You really don’t follow where it ends up.”\nKyle Schwarber hits a Schwarbomb Kyle Schwarber crushes a homer in the seventh inning of the Cubs' NLDS-clinching victory.

If there’s any consideration to do anything differently, you’ve got to keep it there now.”\nStarlin Castro said he thought the best part of Schwarber’s homer was that Schwarber told Dexter Fowler in the outfield he would hit one earlier in the inning.\n“He told them he’d hit that homer, and he did it, and I think it’s pretty awesome,” Castro said.\nSchwarber said he was just joking around, even if the comments turned prophetic.\n“It was just ball talk,” Schwarber said. “We were just talking out there, and I was just joking with him, and I said, ‘Hey, I think I’m going to hit a home run.’ I’m not going to go up there and point.”\nKyle Schwarber's epic home run (graphic) Tribune graphics Tribune graphics Privacy Policy Major League Baseball Kyle Schwarber Wrigley Field Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon Starlin Castro National League", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e8991/turbine/ct-video-schwarber-sends-one-out-of-wrigley-20151014", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200b64/turbine/ct-kyle-schwarber-home-run-ball-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e998c/turbine/ct-schwarber-s-epic-home-run-graphic-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:30:07.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
