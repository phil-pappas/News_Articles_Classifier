According to leaked documents, Jennifer\nLawrence and Amy Adams got paid less than their male co-stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner for American Hustle .\nNow, Jennifer is speaking out about that pay gap in the latest edition of Lenny , Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner's newsletter. She said she's stayed quiet this long because the conversation seemed more like a \"trending topic\" than something concrete, and her wage gap issue is the definition of champagne problems , but she hopes that speaking out will help create change.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below \"When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with dicks, I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself,\" she writes. \"I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early.\"\nShe says that her desire to be liked got in the way of her business sense. \"I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,'\" she writes. \"At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being 'difficult' or 'spoiled.'\"\nWhen the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with dicks, I didn't get mad at Sony.

But if you bluntly speak your mind like a man does, you'll get called out on it. Jennifer says there's a chance her youth and inexperience were more to blame than gender expectations, but lots of women of all ages might convince her it's the other way around.\nJ.Law is known for being one of the most likable stars out there, but she says that's a detriment to her ability to get things done. \"I'm over trying to find the 'adorable' way to state my opinion and still be likable! Fuck that,\" she writes.\nNow, Jennifer has clearly learned from the leak. She reportedly is set to earn $8 million more than Chris Pratt in a new sci-fi drama called Passengers . And it's not just her: After finding out about her own pay gap through the leak, Charlize Theron negotiated to get paid just as much as co-star Chris Hemsworth on the new Snow White and the Huntsman movie. And while millionaires negotiating for more millions might not be relatable, it's a great way to get the conversation started.\nâ€‹Follow Megan on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a5b04a26aae05a24bc4efb63e&id=64e6f35176&e=fe292e1416", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x800/1444746599-landscape-1444737165-gettyimages-454292259.jpg", "http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a30874/blake-lively-ending-preserve/", "https://twitter.com/megancarol"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:25:59.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
