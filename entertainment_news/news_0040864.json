Promoted stories \n“The arrangements I have with the charity are confidential and I don’t really want to get into that,” he said. \n“I absolutely believe in this affair. It’s been an extraordinary experience and a wonderful way of raising money for the charity, and for me it’s something that is important. \n“It is an important part of my calendar, and I’m delighted to have been asked to take part.” \nMoney raised from sales of the London sculptures will go to the Wallace & Gromit Children’s Charity, which supports children in hospitals across the country.
