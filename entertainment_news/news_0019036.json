The boy band has gone on to global fame with hits including What Makes You Beautiful and Drag Me Down. \nEric was born in 2014 to Simon’s close friend, Lauren Silverman. \n— Simon Cowell (@SimonCowell) August 11, 2015 \nSimon, 56, said: “He loves music, and when I say loves it, loves it! Fortunately one of the first records I got on tape of him playing along to was a One Direction record, so he’s got good taste.” \nSpeaking on Good Morning Britain about fatherhood, he said: “I’m great with puppies, I’m not great with babies. Because like a puppy will respond, babies at a certain age don’t do anything, so when he was about five or six (months old) I was like… I just don’t know what to do! Because he wasn’t reacting to me and I thought maybe he hates me. Oh No! He is Dad's little boy. pic.twitter.com/WUBis3vClj \n— Simon Cowell (@SimonCowell) June 22, 2015 Promoted stories \n“And they said: ‘No, take your time’, because once he gets a bit older – and then suddenly one day they are talking, listening, responding, and now talking to him, communicating, whole different ball game, and also they sort of become a bit like you. Which I don’t know is a good thing or a bad thing! He’s a funny little thing.” \nOne Direction singer Louis Tomlinson, 23, is also about to become a father. In July, it was revealed that he is expecting a baby with stylist Briana Jungwirth, after they had a brief fling. \nSimon told Susanna Reid he had passed on advice to Louis: “I just said enjoy it. If I had been his age and someone had said you’re going to have a baby, I’m not sure how I would have coped with it. Louis Tomlinson helping Simon Cowell with his Overs group on The X Factor 2015 (Thames/Syco) \n“But he did call me, and I said: ‘When you’ve embraced it, you’ll be amazed how much you are going to love it and it will change your life for the better’. And that’s it.” \nSpeaking about who he thinks will win this year’s X Factor, the talent show’s judge said: “I think I know who’s going to win but I’ve said this before over the years. Luckily we’ve got some great singers this year. But it’s the live shows when you really find out. \n“This time last year Fleur (East) wasn’t even on my radar and then it came to this part of the show and she was incredible.” X Factor judges Nick Grimshaw, Rita Ora, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Simon Cowell (ITV Pictures) \nOn new X Factor judges Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora, he said: “When you replace someone like Louis (Walsh), it takes a while for people to get used to the person they’ve really, really liked for 10 years, so regardless who was going to come in and take his role, there was always: ‘Well you’re not Louis’– and you’ve got to give people a little bit of time. \n“But now I’ve got to know him (Nick) as a friend. He’s passionate, he’s fun, loves the job, very different from Louis, but I think he’s doing a good job. And Rita I think is fantastic.” Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell (Ian West/PA) \nHe added: “I’ve got the ghost of Louis everywhere at the moment. What’s so weird is that when he was on the show I’d always have people complaining about him, now he’s gone it’s like: ‘Why isn’t he there?’ So I don’t know what’s going to happen. \n“I couldn’t just bring him back. I do like the idea of maybe having a guest judge, something like that, that’s a possibility.” Share article \nThe full interview airs on ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Thursday October 22 from 6am.
