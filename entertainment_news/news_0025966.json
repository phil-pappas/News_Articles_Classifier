Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images Three years ago, a group of 12 women stood on the podium as gold medalists at the London Olympics . Wednesday, five of those women raised the WNBA championship trophy in the air at the Minneapolis Target Center .\nThe Minnesota Lynx's 69-52 win over the Indiana Fever secured a third title in five seasons for the tandem of Maya Moore , Seimone Augustus and Lindsay Whalen, but new to the dance were Sylvia Fowles and Asjha Jones. Fowles, the 30-year-old late-season acquisition was named Finals MVP and collected 20 points and 11 rebounds in Game Five.\nJones, 35, didn't play a minute during the Finals, but entered the elite sorority of women's basketball players to have won an NCAA, WNBA , Olympic, and FIBA World Championship. She joins Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi and Swin Cash (all teammates of hers on the undefeated 2002 national champion Connecticut team), Moore and Kara Wolters (also UConn), Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes, and Tamika Catchings (who was on the wrong side of the ball with Indiana Wednesday).\nFor Moore, her mind-boggling streak of either winning at least one of those four major championships reached seven consecutive years. She had a mortal night of five points on 1-of-8 shooting Wednesday, following a month of some of the most clutch plays in league playoff history. After Game Five, Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said she would have thought her team would have been beat by 20 with Moore being held to that many points.\n\"Maya's about winning,\" Reeve added. \"She's one of the best people you ever come around. Her activity on defense was really good. Maya was really important tonight, even though the box score doesn't show it.\"\nThat 2002 team might be considered the greatest ever, but Moore's 2009 and 2010 undefeated teams involved Lynx teammate Kalana Greene, with Renee Montgomery a senior on the 2009 edition. In total, there were seven UConn national titles on the Lynx, seven LSU Final Fours, plus two NCAA finals from Devereaux Peters at Notre Dame, and Whalen's 2004 Final Four with Minnesota.\n\"There have been different elements of the journey of trying to be successful every single year,\" Moore said, \"and if things don't go perfectly, how do we handle it. The biggest struggle, is our perfectionism. It's really sweet to end this way.\"\nAlso picking up rings Wednesday were: Anna Cruz, the 29-year-old in her second season who won bronze and silver in the last two FIBA World Championships for Spain; Shae Kelley, the rookie from the Minnesota Gophers who transferred from Old Dominion; and Tricia Liston, in her second year from Duke.\n\"What a testament to this team,\" Reeve said. \"This was not an easy year for us by any stretch. We don't have Western Conference home court advantage without Renee and Anna. They kind of heard the words that they were older and this thing was coming to an end. We're not in the WNBA Finals without Rebekkah Brunson.\"\nYes, who can forget Brunson. She might not have been chosen for the Olympic teams and anointed with that superlative over her, but the 12-year veteran from Georgetown is now fifth all-time in rebounding and third on the offensive glass. She recorded a double-double of 10 points and 14 rebounds in Game Five and has controlled the boards in all three of the Lynx's title runs, plus Sacramento's 2005 championship. For the record, she was on the national team that won the 2007 FIBA Americas gold medal to advance the U.S. into the Beijing Games.\nIn comparison to other sports, the Lynx has taken the model of the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Blackhawks, by winning three titles unconsecutively. It has a strong nucleus and has added key role players where needed, and the addition of Fowles makes the dynasty even more solid.", "external_links": ["http://www.olympic.org/", "http://mooremaya.com/", "http://www.targetcenter.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:21:33.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
