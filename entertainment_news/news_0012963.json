(Guy Levy/BBC) \n“I’ve done a lot of pilots for quiz shows and I’ve wanted to work on one for a long time, so I’m thrilled to be involved with a show that I really enjoy,” she said of the programme, which invites contestants to answer quiz questions in a bid to bowl balls down cash lanes while avoiding rolling over “the edge”. \n“It came about very quickly, which rarely happens in television. Because there’s been a first series, there was already confidence behind it, so it was just a case of tweaking the format.” \nThe 42-year-old said she was drawn to the show’s unpredictability. \n“I’m a fan of the physical and mental side of The Edge. I like that the outcome can change; someone who races forward with questions may have a bad roll, and someone who wasn’t so fast may finish up in the final two and manage a good roll. There’s a risk that you can blow it all,” she explained. \nSo far she’s not been able to master the show herself though. \n“I’m a bit gung-ho,” she confessed. “I spend my time telling people to rein it in, and then my roll goes straight off the edge. \n“I’ve completed 25 episodes and I’m still not able to judge it. It looks like a simple skill but it’s really challenging.” So excited I love this show. https://t.co/lVqrZYYjW0 \n— Gabby Logan (@GabbyLogan) October 7, 2015 \nThere’s no doubt however, that Gabby is enjoying her move into quiz shows. \n“[After filming] I kept saying to my husband, ‘I’ve found my calling’. The relationships and dynamics that surface within a show such as The Edge really appeal to me.” \nGabby said working on live sports broadcasts for so many years had prepared her for pretty much any other kind of TV work. \n“I gained a really good grounding from sports presenting and journalism. I was very lucky to get in at a time when I could do that, and spend a long time learning my craft. And live sport gives you a great skill set for other areas of television.” Share article \nThe Edge begins on BBC One on Monday, October 12.
