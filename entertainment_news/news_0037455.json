(AP) — Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush shouldn't be running the country if he can't even run his own campaign, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Saturday.\nTrump was in Jacksonville on Saturday, the day after the Bush campaign announced it is cutting payroll 40 percent. He said Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, is embarrassing his family.\nTrump said he's only spent a couple of million dollars on his campaign and is leading in the polls. He said spending less and getting more is what the country should be doing.\nThousands of raucous supporters cheered Trump in Bush's home state during a riverfront rally. Trump also made fun of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, saying he's out of money and \"sweats like a dog.\"\n__\nThis story has been corrected to show that payroll, not salaries, is being cut 40 percent.\nPersonal Finance - Lifestyle Elections Donald Trump Jeb Bush", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:49:33.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
