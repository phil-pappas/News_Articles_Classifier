Later that year Thirty Acres was featured on the Travel Channel's \"Bizarre Foods America\" with Andrew Zimmern.\nNew York Eater said Nov. 28 will be Thirty Acres' last day and that the couple plan to move to Seattle, where they \"eventually\" hope to open something up.\n\"It wasn't financially stable, or the type of thing where we could sustain our family life with our new daughter,\" Kevin Pemoulie told New York Eater.\n\"That's probably for a lot of reasons. Maybe the timing wasn't right. Maybe Jersey City didn't want us, or we didn't want them at the right time. There's no negative here whatsoever.
