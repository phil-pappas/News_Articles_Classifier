High pressure was on top of the region, but now a cold front will be approaching from the west and stream in clouds overnight. Lows will range from the upper 40s north and west to the upper 50s in Center City.\nNOAA Wednesday morning will be cloudy with showers pushing eastward along the cold front; light showers will arrive by lunchtime with just 0.10\" or less of precipitation. Highs will be in the lower 70s with a southerly wind ahead of the cold front, but then we'll clear out overnight so temperatures will drop around 50(40s north and west).\nThursday will be sun-filled and with a westerly wind highs will be in the upper 60s ; a bit cooler on Thursday with highs in the middle 60s with a northwesterly wind, but clouds will increase overnight into Friday morning ahead of a weak front. Light showers will round out the work week, but we'll dry out just in time for the weekend....with a catch! Highs will just be in thr 50s with a northwesterly wind between 15-20mph and that Fall feel will definitely take over!\nFor now enjoy your night, but don't forget to follow updates on my Twitter account(@scott_derek) as well as check my 7-day forecast(& follow the animated radar) ANY TIME at www.scottderekwx.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:07:47.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
