Followers believe that the vegetarian festival and its accompanying sacred rituals bestow good fortune upon those individuals who religiously observe the rites as well as the wider community. Tweet During the festival, local residents of Chinese ancestry strictly observe a 10-day vegetarian or vegan diet for the purposes of spiritual cleansing and merit-making. Sacred rituals are performed at various Chinese shrines and temples and aesthetic displays such as walking barefooted over hot coals and ascending ladders with bladed rungs are performed by entranced devotees known as \"Ma Song''. Ma Song, or entranced horses, are devotees whom the gods enter during the festival. Devotees manifest supernatural powers and perform self-tortures in order to shift evil from individuals onto themselves and to bring good luck to the community. Ma Song fall into two categories: those who, having had an intimation of impending doom, want to extend their lives; and people specially chosen by the gods for their moral qualities. Throughout the festival fireworks and drums are sounded, especially during ceremonies. The louder the drums, the better, because the noise drives away evil spirits. Phuket's Vegetarian festival began in 1825, when the Govenor of Thalang moved the island's main town from Ta Reua,in Thalang District, to Get-Hoe in Kathu District. At that time, a large number of Chinese people worked at the tin mine in Kathu and the area was largely covered by jungle and fever was rife. A traveling opera company came from China to perform for the miners. Soon the whole opera company grew sick from an unnamed malady and they decided to adopt a strict vegetarian diet to honor two of the emperor gods, Kiew Ong Tai Teh and Yok Ong Sone Teh. The sickness afflicting the opera troupe soon disappeared. The people of Kathu were amazed at the groups recovery and asked how it was done. They were told the ritual vegetarianism and attendant ceremonies had been the apparent cure. People embraced the faith enthusiastically and the annual festival began from that time. Later, a man familiar with the festival volunteered to return to Kansai, in China, where he invited the sacred Hiao Ho-le or Hiao lan (incense smoke) and Lian Tui (name plaques), which have the status of gods, to come stay in Kathu. He returned to Phuket on the seventh night of the ninth month, bringing back holy writings for use in the ceremonies. Hearing of his arrival, the people went in procession to Bang Niao Pier to bring him and his sacred cargo back. This was the origin of the processions that figure so greatly in the festival. The afternoon before the festival begins, a great pole at each temple is raised - called the Go Teng pole - with which the gods are invited to descend. At midnight the pole is hung with nine lanterns, signaling the opening of the festival. Two important gods, Yok Ong Hong Tae and Kiew Ong Tai Tae, are also invited down at midnight to preside over ceremonies. Other ceremonies also occur throughout the festival, including: - the invocation of the gods Lam Tao (who keeps track of the living) and Pak Tao (who keeps track of the dead) - processions of the gods' images - feats of the Ma Song (self-mortification, piercing and bathing in hot oil) - bladed ladder climbing - fire-walking The festival ends with ceremonies at each temple and the send-off of the gods on the last night. 10 RULES FOR THE VEGETARIAN FESTIVAL 1.
