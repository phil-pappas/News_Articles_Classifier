It previously published a story claiming Shelton had cheated on Lambert and that contributed to their divorce. \nThe rehab cover story also proclaimed that Shelton had hit \"rock bottom.\" \n\"To be clear: Mr. Shelton has not hit rock bottom,\" the lawsuit states. It accuses In Touch of publishing the story without reaching out to the singer's lawyers or other representatives. \nThe lawsuit states Shelton, 39, has sought a retraction of the story but received no response. \nIn addition to monetary damages, Shelton is seeking an injunction that would prevent In Touch from repeating allegations in the disputed story. \nAnthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:32:04.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
