ABC's \"Black-ish\" did it in its second season premiere last month. \nIn other news, \"Truth Be Told\" premieres Friday night on NBC. \nStarring TV veteran Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Mitch, an ethics professor who majors in white guilt, and African-American stand-up comic Tone Bell as Russell, an African-American stand-up comic, \"Truth Be Told\" is being marketed as an edgy comedy about race, sex and other hot-button matters. In fact, it is a traditional laugh-track sitcom that lazily circles the taboos and only rarely scores a hit. \nCreator DJ Nash (the one-and-done \"Growing Up Fisher\" ) based the show on real-life experiences — he's a white guy who is married to a Korean woman and whose best friend is black. But based on the pilot, the characters on \"Truth Be Told\" are about as deep as the descriptions I just gave you of Nash's circle. \nThere's Vanessa Hudgens as Tracy, Mitch's \"ethnically ambiguous\" wife, and Bresha Webb as Angie, Russell's stereotypically sassy African-American wife. TV Minute: Vicki Hyman on 'Truth Be Told' NJ.com TV critic Vicki Hyman explains why she hated the new NBC comedy 'Truth Be Told.\" \nThey're all likeable enough, but the set-ups are straight out of a dog-eared playbook. Tracy hires a babysitter who is too distractingly hot for Mitch, turning him into the sort of drooling degenerate last spotted in a R. Crumb cartoon. Russell is jealous that Angie is still close with an ex-boyfriend. And the \"candid\" conversations that supposedly set this sitcom apart are barely a step above. \nThe two buddies are rapping along with Jay Z to \"Empire State of Mind,\" but Russell cuts off the song just as Mitch is about utter the N word. \n\"It's just not a word that you have access to,\" Russell tells him. \nMitch: \"But you should hear me to do it, because I don't pronounce the 'r'!\" \nThese are the jokes, folks. \nCompare to \"Black-ish,\" where even one of the premiere's tossed-off jokes about race are highly specific and telling. In a discussion about other outdated racial terms vis a vis the United Negro College Fund, Dre (Anthony Anderson) tells his boss, \"Be honest — you only wrote that check so you can say Negro.\" \nThe boss's response: \"I definitely didn't do it so I can't.\" \n\"Truth Be Told\" premieres on NBC Friday 8:30 p.m. on NBC, where your alternative, sadly, is the similar misfire \"Dr. Ken.\" Actually, \"Dr. Ken,\" starring Ken Jeong, is even worse . NBC recently gave a surprising second season order to another race-infused sitcom \"The Carmichael Show,\" also a traditional multi-cam comedy but with a sharper take on race. Check that out on NBC.com, or just log onto ABC.com and catch an episode of \"Black-ish\" instead. \nGrade: D+ \nVicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com .
