During the Canadian singer's visit to the show, Nicki Minaj surprised viewers when she joined him to rap a brand new verse from the recently-dropped official remix of \"The Hills\". Flaunting major cleavage in a skintight Balmain dress, Minaj came out on the stage midway through the song and delivered some bars like, \"Remember that time I showed up with just panties up in my coat/ High heels that was knee high and my legs was gripping that throat,\" and, \"You the president and I'm Biden/ Just slide in 'cause you safe, n***a - third base.\" The collaboration with Minaj was released on iTunes shortly before The Weeknd's appearance on \"SNL\". In addition to the Young Money raptress, he released another version of the chart-topping hit featuring Eminem . Later in the episode, The Weeknd returned to the stage solo and played his other biggest single \"Can't Feel My Face\". Both songs he performed that night peaked at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100. They were lifted off his latest album \" Beauty Behind the Madness \" which debuted atop Billboard 200 following its arrival a few weeks ago. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:46.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
