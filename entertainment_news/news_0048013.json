(Photo by Jon Furniss Photography/Invision/AP, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — These are trying times at the Broadway show “Therese Raquin” — first a show was interrupted by a man in the audience who threw flowers and now star Keira Knightley has had to withdraw from Wednesday’s performance. \nRoundabout Theatre Company said “a minor injury” to Knightley has forced the evening show to be cancelled. The theater company expects her to be ready for Thursday night’s show. \nThis isn’t the first time the show has made news even before it opens. Knightley, who plays the title character in the play, was onstage Oct. 1 with Gabriel Ebert when a young man in the mezzanine got up, went to the railing and shouted. \nKnightly did not break character, and the man was heard to say: “Five seconds is too long to wait for a response!” An usher came and escorted the man back to his seat. When security arrived, the man tossed the flowers on his way out. \nThe disturbance took place at the Studio 54 Theatre, the same location where last year actor Shia LaBeouf was handcuffed during a performance of “Cabaret” for yelling obscenities. \nKnightley made her West End debut in 2009 in the comedy “The Misanthrope” and two years later starred in Lillian Hellman’s “The Children’s Hour.” \nLast year, she revealed that she tore a muscle running through a door while filming “The Imitation Game.” \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:42:12.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
