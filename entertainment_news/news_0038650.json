To be fair, it's not everyday you see a vulture with its head stuck inside a dead pig's arse.\nIf you're wondering why the bird had its head around the unhappy end of the dead animal, the reason is that vultures usually get started on dead prey through the soft tissue of the rectum as opposed to dealing with raw, tough hide. It just so happens in this case that the bird got swallowed up.\nAccording to Fushille, the bird was stuck for about an hour inside the dead swine before freeing itself. And if you're wondering why he didn't try to help it, it's because \"vultures are prone to throw up as a defence mechanism\" and Fushille didn't want\"pig ass\" on him, which is fair enough.\nVia Metro\nMORE: Watch: Aussie teen makes epic Snapchat story after he's left home alone for the weekend\nMORE: Watch: Surfer has incredible close encounter with whale in California\nMORE: Watch: These pick-up lines from around the world are so atrocious it hurts", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEPg3Pt5HTQ", "http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/20/vulture-gets-its-head-stuck-up-pigs-backside-5450104/"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:06:28.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
