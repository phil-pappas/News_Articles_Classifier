Alicia Powell reports.   \nHolocaust drama \"Son of Saul\" continues its festival circuit run. Hungarian director Laszlo Nemes presented the film at the BFI London Film Festival. The film -- the tale of a Jewish \"sonderkommando\" death camp worker who finds a corpse he believes is his son's and sets his mind to burying him -- won the jury's Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. In a movie at times almost too intense to watch, Nemes and his cast show the \"sonderkommando\" teams who were used by the Nazis to convince newly arrived inmates at Auschwitz to strip off their clothes and enter the gas chambers -- on the pretense they should move quickly or their soup would get cold. Following the acclaim at Cannes, the director says he had not expected such big success for his film so soon. SOUNDBITE: Laszlo Nemes, director, saying (English): \"I don't think you make a film thinking of the awards. But you definitely have the hope of reaching audiences and possibly reaching audiences worldwide. So, yeah, it's been incredibly intense and for the film a great chance to travel and to be projected in many places. So, yeah, it's been rather incredible.\" Nemes filmed on 35MM rather than digital cameras as he believes film can better communicate the emotion of the movie. Some say the result is graphic and making the film had a profound effect on the actors and crew. SOUNDBITE: Levente Molnar, actor, saying (English): \"It was not easy to shoot this movie actually. Because when you are on set and having something to perform which is mainly unimaginable which was going on there. Even for me these days it's incomprehensible. We had our rough moments.\" Filmmakers reject criticism they depicted the \"sonderkommando\" in an overly understanding way, saying they worked painstakingly hard to remain faithful to facts.  //reut.rs/1Mpte0n", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:07:31.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
