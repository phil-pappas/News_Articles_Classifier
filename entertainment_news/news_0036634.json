The ale flavor is subtle (though more apparent if you pick around the caramel and brownie). Said another tester: “I love the concept, (but) I would like more beer flavor.”\nThe ice cream will be available at Ben & Jerry’s Scoop Shops and at retail stores ($4.89 a pint). New Belgium is also releasing Salted Caramel Brownie Brown Ale in bottles ($9.99), on shelves Nov. 2.\nA portion of the proceeds from this ice-cream-craft-beer partnership will benefit Protect Our Winters, which pro-snowboarder Jeremy Jones founded in 2007 to, notes a press release: “bridge the gap between the winter sports community and actions needed to address climate change.”\njhevrdejs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @judytrib\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56293e11/turbine/ct-ben-jerrys-new-belgium-making-ale-ice-cream-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:28:36.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
