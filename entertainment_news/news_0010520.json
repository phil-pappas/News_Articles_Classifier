The most important thing to say to the girls is to not try to be like the other girl.\n\"Not to try to fit in, but to try to really be profound thinkers that are excited about their differences and explore what they are and who they are and what can come out of the new,\" Hayek said.\nThe mother of 8-year-old daughter, who was honoured at the luncheon for her work with the Chime for Change charity, said women have to strength to give this world a new face.\n\"I think the voice of women can change the world, but we don't know our voice. We've never really investigated.\n\"We've been too busy for many, many decades and generations, trying to operate within systems that were designed by men.
