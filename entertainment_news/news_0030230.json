(PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nMark Cuban says he won’t hold an online Q&A session on Twitter because “I’m going to get 300 people calling me something stupid.” ¹\nConversations on reddit are “technically and visually daunting” to newcomers, and not very easy to use on smartphones. ²\nThose experiences, and countless others, are the driving force behind the October 12 launch of StageHound , a beta-tested fan engagement platform that solves the major issues confronting influencers who want to authentically connect online with their fans and followers.\nBacked by Silicon Valley angel investors, StageHound provides a safe and fun place for influencers and their fans to make personal connections, have genuine 1-on-1 conversations, and exchange ideas and synchronously share media content – all in a real-time social setting.\n“Now more than ever, we are witnessing influencers attempting to connect with their fan base using social media channels, doing AMAs (Ask Me Anything) and Q&A sessions. Influencers’ desire to connect with fans is more popular than ever and growing fast,” said Matt Coalson, co-founder and head of product at StageHound.\nCoalson continues, ”But using current tools makes it extremely difficult to have authentic, two-way conversations. There’s lots of distracting content, and interactions are confusing for both parties. They’re also generally not well-organized, causing people to feel left out and unheard. So we developed a real-time platform that captures the audiences’ attention, gets everybody involved and creates a memorable, high-energy entertainment experience.”\nStageHound provides significant controls such as moderated, structured and organized interactions that promote the marketing agendas of influencers and brands while keeping sessions troll and spam-free. StageHound is also platform-agnostic and can be branded and sponsored to the promoter’s specifications.\nBuilt and rigorously tested by gaming platform professionals, StageHound is specifically crafted to handle large numbers of concurrent users, and uses game mechanics to keep the audience actively engaged during the events.\nIn a typical StageHound event, questions are submitted, sorted, filtered and then voted upon by the fan community to ensure that the host can choose from the best ones. The format promotes structured 1-on-1 conversations while the rest of the participants can watch and interact with who's on center stage. Hosts can also showcase and share video and audio content – YouTube and SoundCloud for now – in a social setting where everyone is watching the same thing at the same time.\n“StageHound is designed to be used by anybody, even those with zero technical proficiency,” CTO and co-founder Kabriel Robichaux said.\nSeveral big names in entertainment and business are scheduled to host StageHound events following the official launch.\nPress is invited to join a live demo with StageHound’s co-founder and product chief on Monday, October 12 from 11am-2pm ET / 8-11am PT at http://www.getstagehound.com\nFor more information, please contact:\nCraig Stanford, Vice President, StageHound\ncraig(at)getstagehound(dot)com, +1 (415) 640-9554\nSources:\n¹ RE/CODE’s Code/Media event 02/23/2015 video at 23:00 ( http://recode.net/2015/02/23/mark-cuban-vs-the-world-the-full-codemedia-interview-video/ )\n² New York Times / Farhad Manjoo, 07/14/2015 ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/technology/personaltech/one-way-to-reform-reddit-give-users-a-share-in-profits.html )\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013446.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/technology/personaltech/one-way-to-reform-reddit-give-users-a-share-in-profits.html", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13013446.htm", "http://recode.net/2015/02/23/mark-cuban-vs-the-world-the-full-codemedia-interview-video/"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:49:25.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
