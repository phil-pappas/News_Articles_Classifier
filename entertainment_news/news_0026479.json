Our goal is to bring forth what all children share in common, not their differences. Children with autism share in the joy of playing and loving and being friends and being part of a group.\" \nSesame Street (Photo: Sesame Workshop) \nKids can already get to know Julia through a new online storybook called \"We're Amazing, 1, 2, 3!\" \nIn the story, fan favorite Muppet Elmo goes on a playdate with his pal Julia and helps another friend, Abby, understand Julia. \nIn the story, fan favorite Muppet Elmo goes on a playdate with his pal Julia and helps another friend, Abby, understand Julia. (Photo: Marybeth Nelson/ Sesame Workshop) \n\"Elmo's daddy told Elmo that Julia has autism,\" he says. \"So she does things a little differently. Sometimes Elmo talks to Julia using fewer words and says the same thing a few times. ... Oh, and sometimes Elmo waits a long time for Julia to answer.\" \nKnowing that, Abby finds it easy to make friends with Julia, too. \nBut Julia's storybook isn't the only story available: \n\"Sesame Workshop is uniquely positioned to play a meaningful role in increasing peoples' understanding about autism,\" Sherrie Westin, executive vice president of global impact and philanthropy at Sesame Workshop, said in a statement. \"This project is an extension of the belief we've always promoted: 'We are all different, but all the same.' I am passionate about this initiative, and am so proud of the partnerships with the autism community that have led to this.\" \nSee all the resources for parents, caregivers, teacher and kids at www.SesameStreet.org/Autism .
