He's done promo work for CNN and USA, commercials for Miller Lite and the NBA, and he's lent his voice to movie trailers for big pics like Fury and Unbroken . None of that ring a bell? If you've been watching Jane the Virgin (you should be! The show is great!), you'll know him as the \"Latin Lover\" narrator of the hit show (hi, can you narrate my life please?). Cosmopolitan.com talked to Mendez about how he got his start, what it's like being an anonymous TV star, and more.\nMore from Cosmo for Latinas 20 articles Latino Organizations Call on \"SNL\" to Drop Donald...

We always knew that the Mendez men had a very heavy and strong voice. There were no secrets in the family, because it was impossible for us to whisper. But I didn't get the hint until I got to high school. There was one Spanish class, where every time I'd say something, a couple of the girls would be like, \"Oh, could he do it again?\" That felt kind of weird.\nDo people recognize your voice before they recognize you? I don't think so, only because the character on Jane the Virgin has such a distinct accent. Obviously, I have a New York/New Jersey/urban accent, but this character's so \"Latin Lover\" that I don't think most people recognize my voice. I do know there is still something about my voice, because at Starbucks for example, when I place my order, people will turn their head to see who's talking. They're probably disappointed once they see me, because we never match what we sound like. It's true! You never look like what you sound like.\nWas the narrator always supposed to be such an important character, or did that develop more over time? If you look back at the first episode, you can tell that the dude's fun, but he's a little bit more reserved. Now he's like your viewing buddy. I knew there was something different about [him] when I got the script. I got the script and it said, \"Latin Lover narrator with a Hispanic telenovela accent,\" and it was a little off-putting. I was like, \"I don't want to do this shit,\" until I read it. What attracted me to the character once I read it was the hint of his personality. There's a line in the first episode right after Jane tells Michael she's pregnant, and the narrator says, \"What would serve Michael Cordero in the illustrious detective career he would go on to have was his ability to focus on facts, and the fact was ... this sucked.\" That took me aback a bit. I was like, \"Oh shit, this is going to be cool.\"\nWhy were you initially worried about the \"Latin Lover\" part of the character? Do you ever worry that you'll be typecast into stereotypical roles? I think just by being Latino in this country you're already kind of typecast, and I think it happens to a lot of my friends who are voiceover actors of color. As an American Latino, my language of affinity is English. Yeah, I learned Spanish at home, but my stronger vocabulary is English. But people always expect you to have this incredible mastery of the Spanish language. And as a voiceover actor, the fact that I have \"Mendez\" attached to my name already pigeonholes me. I've been told I sound African-American to some people, and so early on some of the agencies I freelanced with would send me on auditions for African-American roles and then people would see that my last name was Mendez, and be like, \"Well, is he really black?\" And I'm like, \"Who cares? It's what you sound like, right? I'm not putting it on, this is just how I speak.\" Especially being Dominican, we've always had a strong African root in our culture, but it's almost like we're not allowed to express it. So I'm used to being typecast. But I don't mind doing an Hispanic accent as long as they don't make fun of the accent and the accent's not the joke.\nFollow Alanna on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/640x800/gallery-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/320x160/landscape-1445267492-texasdenyingbabiesbirthcertificates.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x2000/gallery-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/480x600/gallery-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/768x960/gallery-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/320x160/landscape-1445275141-gettyimages-493141868.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1280x1600/gallery-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x800/landscape-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1445193647-screen-shot-2015-10-18-at-114022-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/320x160/landscape-1445263993-gettyimages-462346278.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/alannaknunez", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/980x1225/gallery-1445013098-gettyimages-486519340.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:11:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
