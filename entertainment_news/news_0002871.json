(Yui Mok/PA) \nIn an interview on Good Morning Britain, Louis said: “”It will definitely be emotional I think. Once we kind of take it in for all it is, because we’ve spent five years touring every year and not touring for a year next year is going to be quite bizarre. \n“You’re kind of counting down the shows now, thinking there’s not many left, so you’re really appreciating every moment, not that it’s the end. But still, it’s important.” \nHe told the programme: “There’s no doubt we’ll see plenty of each other, we will.” \nThe heartthrob said they are“like family now”, adding: “It’s like leaving school and leaving your friends behind.” Promoted stories The fab @Louis_Tomlinson & @Real_Liam_Payne play me @onedirection 's new single out fri.
