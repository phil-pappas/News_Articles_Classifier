And although the mom-to-be has a month to go, she did tell daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres which name she really likes for her future son. \n\"I do like the name Easton...Easton West,\" she admitted on The Ellen DeGeneres Show . \" I don't think my husband likes that name, but I do like it.\" \nThe baby boy, who reportedly is due on Christmas Day, will be the second child for the reality star and husband, Kanye West. They are already parents to 2-year-old North. \nKardashian also said she knows one name that won't make the cut. \"I don’t think we'll go another direction. It's definitely not South,\" she said. \"Every time someone says South, I just want to roll my eyes. ...It's not a good direction.\" \nAnd although Kardashian has been open about her struggle to have a second child, she said a psychic told her that \"'You’re going to have twins in 2018.'\" \nKardashian said she told the woman, \"'Lose my email. No I’m not!'\" \n  Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 7:01AM by", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:15.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
