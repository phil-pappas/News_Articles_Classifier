From there, he recounts how \"Toby\" and another educator, Doug Unger, advised him not to \"lose the magic\" as he struggles to work on a book.\n\"We don't know any good, real stories, which is why we have been writing all of these stories about kids having sex with crocodiles and so forth,\" he writes.\nIn one notable anecdote, he describes how Wolff confronted SU cheerleaders in 1987 to emphasize the importance of their work:\nI am in a workshop with Toby. One night, our workshop is being disrupted by the Syracuse University cheerleading squad practicing loudly in the room above. Toby grows increasingly annoyed. Finally he excuses himself. We're worried. In Syracuse, the cheerleading squad is about equal in status to the Mayor. We think of how we might console Professor Wolff if he returns with an S.U. megaphone squashed down on his head. But no: instead, here come the chastened cheerleaders, humbly toting their boom box, muttering obscenities.\nToby sits down.\n\"Let's continue,\" he says.\nSyracuse University cheerleaders are pictured at a 1997 football game. File photo by Dick Blume Other notable tales include how Saunders met his wife Paula Redick in SU's creative writing class and became engaged after three weeks of dating, his \"crap\" final thesis and how he toiled after graduation as a poor but happy tech writer to support their two children. By 1997, his first book had been published, he was teaching at SU himself and was on his way towards a career that now includes a MacArthur Fellowship and acclaimed titles like \"In Persuasion Nation\" and \"Tenth of December: Stories.\"\n\"My Writing Education,\" along with essays by James Franco, Henry Rollins and nearly 70 others, will appear in the collection \" A Manner of Being: Writers on Their Mentors \" this December.\n» Watch George Saunders' moving commencement speech at SU\n» National Book Award finalist George Saunders has 'no complaints'", "external_links": ["http://www.umass.edu/umpress/title/manner-being", "http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/my-writing-education-a-timeline"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:38:05.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
