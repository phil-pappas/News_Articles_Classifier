Now age 99 and resident of Windward Gardens in Rockland, she has decided to give a special hooked rug to the Waldoborough Historical Society and asked two of her former students, Kathie Hills and Sarah Monaghan-Houghton, to deliver it. Titled “The Rug That Could Not Be Hooked,” it came to the WHS museum on Oct. 1, accompanied by an illustrated book that tells the story of the rug. \nWhen Dixon was approaching her 87th birthday, 15 of her students, without telling her what they hoped to do, asked her this question: could a patchwork rug be made by several rug hookers? Her answer was: “Child, you can’t make a patchwork hooked rug. Everyone has their own hooking style!” \nHer answer did not discourage them, however, for they very much wanted to honor Dixon in a special way. They made plans for each one to hook a 7-by-7 inch square with a personal design on a canvas of linen. The backing, containing the lined spaces and border, was sent to each of the 15 rug hookers for a period of two weeks, with the understanding that it would be sent on to the next person after a square was completed. Each square of the rug carried with it lots of thought, for it depicted the craftswoman’s relationship to Dixon over the years that she served as teacher. \nThe rug was completed with a hooked black border and the women held an 87th birthday celebration in 2003 with a traditional Maine potluck meal, topped off with birthday cake, at Dixon’s home. Then they presented her with their gift, and she was most surprised. She took the rug with her when she had to leave her Waldoboro home, and it has offered her many hours of pleasure over the past years, as she placed it directly across from her special chair “so she could see it.” \nNow the rug, along with a book of pictures of each of the women who had a hand in fashioning it, resides in the museum on Main Street/Route 220. It is an artifact that will be carefully tended by the museum’s textile caretakers. The trustees are delighted with Dixon’s decision to give her rug to the collection of Waldoboro Rugs that form a key exhibit in the Hauck/Bailey Building. It is the generous gifts of Waldoboro citizens that enhance the collection and help preserve aspects of the way of life here for generations to come. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
