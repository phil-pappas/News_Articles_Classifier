Like, girlfriend has already run 10 miles, gotten a blowout, and made vegan banana bread pudding from scratch before you've even opened your lazy, useless eyes. How does she do it?! And how do we (me and you and everyone else) fail to?! Meh, better just go back to sleep and try again tomorrow .\nMore From Cosmopolitan No! Not today!\nAccording to lore/a press release I received, Lea does it all by journaling. \"By committing your goals to paper — which can admittedly be very intimidating, and sometimes even embarrassing thing to do — you are taking a big step toward making them a reality and not just a passing dream,\" she writes in her second book, You First: Journal Your Way to Your Best Life . (Lea's first book, Brunette Ambition ​, is a New York Times best seller. Duh.) Through journaling, Lea has created a \"safe space to dream\" for us muggles — and I have to tell you, I'm into it.\nAs a chubby nerd who grew up sandwiched between her more popular siblings, I spent a lot of my time writing down my hopes, dreams, and various short stories in different diaries. Of course, all that ended when my younger brother found my stack and proceeded to read one of my short stories (which were very advanced for my age and also featured myself as a blonde, a brunette, and a stunning redhead with green eyes) at the dinner table. I retreated to my room to tear up most of the remaining evidence of my dorkdom.\nBut times have changed! I'm now a chubby nerd who lives just with my husband and two dogs, and they can't judge me! Rather, they can, but really, who cares? It's just a man and some dogs. And I want to dream again! And I need a safe space to do so! And I just don't think I'm old enough to take Oprah's advice yet, so teach me, Lea! You're my only hope!\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Cracking the spine on the journal, I'm treated to an intro in which Lea tells me all about how great journaling is and about how I'm gonna have my life changed. I'm already sold, so I skim this stuff. That's OK, right? I gotta get to this transformation going before dinner time. My dream clock's a tickin', and it turns out I'm gonna need to put in some serious hours, as the book is divided into several sections. (Note: The whole program lasts a month of hardcore journaling and then six more months of checking back in to make sure you're achieving your dreams. Serious business. I decide to give it a week and if I'm not transformed into a totally different person, I'll burn the book in a fire. Seems fair.)\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Family The idea in this section is to explore your roots. I don't even know my grandfather's name on my mom's side. This is sad. I shoot off some emails to my parents and my aunt Laurie (our family's de-facto historian) and pat myself on the back for a job well done. I am crushing this journaling thing.
