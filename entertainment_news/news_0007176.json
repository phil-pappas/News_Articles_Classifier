There’s a spoiler in that last rt that has been REALLY DIFFICULT not to tell everyone. #DoctorWho \n— Sarah Dollard (@snazdoll) October 24, 2015 \nMaisie played immortal Viking girl Ashildr in The Girl Who Died, and made her second appearance as a highwaywoman in The Woman Who Lived. \nAt the end of the episode, Ashildr describes herself as the patron saint of the companions the Doctor leaves behind and was shown in the background of a present day selfie. \nMoffat has said that Maisie will not be the Doctor’s new companion, after it was announced that Jenna Coleman would be leaving the show as Clara Oswald this series. \nMaisie said last week that there was a good chance viewers would see Ashildr again and possibly in future series. (Simon Ridgway/BBC) \n“I’m hoping she comes back. Everyone’s been asking if she comes back. I hope so, but I have no idea. \n“I know they’ve had characters similar to Ashildr that have returned in future episodes and series, so we’ll see. I think there’s a good chance!” she said. \nFace The Raven also features the return of character Rigsy, played by Jovian Wade, who was last seen in series eight’s Flatline when he joined Clara to fight off some evil graffiti.
