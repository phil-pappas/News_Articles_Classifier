Bringing awareness to the phantom phenomenon during Breast Cancer Awareness month and near the Halloween holiday was suggested by friends of mastectomy survivors.\nSalt Lake City, UT (PRWEB) October 23, 2015\nA few weeks after her mastectomy, breast cancer survivor, university professor and radio host, Kim Power Stilson found it took almost more guts to go out of the house looking lopsided with one breast missing than it did to brave the surgery. When she finally made it out into public she noticed a strange pain (beyond the surgical pain) in her left breast, which was no longer there. At first she dismissed it, but later when someone reached across where her left breast would have been and felt the same pain she realized she might have phantom or ghost boob pain. She talked to Dr. Kenneth C Oliver DC, DACNB at The Neuro Clinic who confirmed her suspicions.\n“There are over 80 references in peer reviewed medical journals that discuss the fascinating application of mirror therapy and phantom pain. It’s time to show that ‘ghost boob’ can be treated and change this terrible pain from mastectomy for those who suffer from it.” - Dr. Kenneth C Oliver DC, DACNB at The Neuro Clinic.\n“For me the ghost boob pain was quite uncomfortable,” said Kim Power Stilson, 51, who recently published an eBook about her journey through breast cancer, called The Surthrival Tree. . “As challenging as it was to look lopsided it was even more stressful to feel my breast as if it were still there and yet still look lopsided. I felt odd and felt like I looked odd. ”\nAfter hearing about the \"No Bra Day\" and feeling it missed the mark in creating awareness for mastectomy survivors, a few of Kim’s friends decided they needed to speak out to support her and other women who had experienced a mastectomy by declaring a day that really shared the story. They choose the date of October 29th during Breast Cancer Awareness month and the “Ghost Boob” name because of its fun proximity to Halloween and because the name fit.\n“For those who have had a mastectomy it’s not just about healing from surgery it is also about getting back to living and that includes getting dressed, getting out, and living with the lopsided look and pain, ” said MaryLyn Linge, friend. “These women have had enough tough stuff in their lives. The goal for Ghost Boob Awareness Day is to add a little levity to a difficult situation by bringing awareness to women who really feel the pain of being lopsided.”\n“People’s support for my post-mastectomy pain has given me courage. My husband gave me a t-shirt with the word ‘flawless’ on the left side where my breast was,” said Kim. “I am going to wear that on Ghost Boob day in honor of all women who have braved mastectomy surgery, its ghost pain and lopsided aftermath.”\nCreated by friends of mastectomy survivors, Ghost Boob Awareness Day is Thursday, October 29th 2015. It's a day set aside during Breast Cancer Awareness month to bring awareness to mastectomy survivors who really feel the pain of being lopsided. The phantom pain is real.
