Talking to Yahoo! Movies to promote his new film \" Bridge of Spies \", Spielberg casually hinted that he would do \" Indiana Jones V \" with Harrison Ford on board to reprise his role. In the interview, Spielberg was with Tom Hanks and joked about his tendency to make movies with the same leading actors over time. He also mentioned that \"Bridge of Spies\" marked the fourth time that he had worked with Hanks. Thus, Hanks and Ford are even as the latter also had four movies with Spielberg. \"We've gotta figure this out because now,\" Spielberg said. \"Tom is tied with Harrison Ford: Harrison and I did four movies, Tom and I have done four movies.\" In the midst of the interview, Spielberg slipped a hint about making \"Indiana Jones 5\". \"Now I'll probably do an 'Indy 5' with Harrison. It'll be five for Harrison, four for Tom... [Then] I've got to make another one with Tom, so that will be five for Tom, five for Harrison,\" Spielberg continued joking. \"And I think I'm going to leapfrog that way for the rest of my career. With Daniel Day-Lewis in everything else!\" Although the director ended it with a joke, there is a possibility that it will actually happen. This is not the first time fans have heard news about \"Indiana Jones 5\". Back in May, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy stated her plans for a fifth movie, though she stressed that they hadn't even started working on a script yet. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Indiana Jones V News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:10:18.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
