The rock star ended up stealing the spotlight from Layla Grant during her Opry debut, further damaging her fraught relationship with Rayna’s label. \nJuliette Barnes turned to drugs to forget, as she continued to run from Avery Barclay and their baby. Tabloid gossip accusing her husband of cheating with her assistant only fueled her descent further. AfterCadence gave him a scare, Avery landed the gig producing Keen’s new project for Rayna, making him believe it’s finally time to let Juliette go. \nGunnar Scott agreed to help Scarlett’s boyfriend write a song for her, which ironically only magnified the fact that he’s still not over his old flame. \nLook for the next installment of Nashville next Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on ABC. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
