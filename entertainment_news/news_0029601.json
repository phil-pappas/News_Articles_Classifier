Comment Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 9:40 AM Updated at 12:04 PM Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 9:40 AM Updated at 12:04 PM Jennifer Lawrence is gearing up for her final Hunger Games press tour, and it seems that the actress is planning to go out with a bang. During an MTV campfire chat with her Mockingjay co-stars Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth , Lawrence called host Josh Horowitz \"a pervert,\" admitted to peeing in sinks, and stuck two fingers in Hemsworth's face and asked \"does this smell like your mom?\" Jennifer Lawrence says Donald Trump presidency would be \"the end of the world\" But the truly peak J.Law moment had to be when the Oscar-winner stuffed ten marshmallows into her mouth, before spitting them all out into a bowl and telling this story: \"That really does remind me of a date. I was 16 and I was chugging this Icee, which are 90 percent air or something. And then I burped and it all reacted in my stomach and all the foam started coming out. And I was like, 'Well, I'm not going to the bathroom.' So I just took the top off [of the Icee] and all the foam was just slowly pouring out of me [into the cup].\" Never change, J.Law .
