More than 4,000 gastroenterologists, physicians and other health care professionals from around the world will convene at the Hawaii Convention Center to review and present the latest scientific advances in gastrointestinal research, treatment of digestive diseases and clinical practice management. \"This year is the best ever in terms of the quality of the science being presented, as well as depth and breadth of the educational sessions,\" said John R. Saltzman , MD, FACG, Chair, ACG Educational Affairs Committee, Director of Endoscopy, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston and Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School . \n\"The abstract selection process was an extremely competitive process this year with 2524 abstracts submitted. There will be 67 presented as oral papers including the 10 top studies at the Presidential Plenary Session on Monday, October 19th . All of the posters of distinction are outstanding and worthy of oral presentations if there was enough time. There are also a great many outstanding clinical vignettes this year,\" noted Dr. Saltzman. \nNew for ACG 2015, the College offers a series of pre-recorded video press briefings which feature the insights of leading gastroenterology experts and the authors of several key abstracts that will be unveiled in Honolulu relating to FMT, constipation, obesity and metabolic syndrome.
