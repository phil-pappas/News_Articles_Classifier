There's a little bit more humour - and coming from Oliver as well. Stephen [Amell] plays a great straight man. He's really good at that stuff.\"Mericle also admitted balancing the comic book bits, the action and the romance is difficult, because the fans sometimes lend themselves toward one element\"The show, I think one of the reasons it's been such a success, is we're constantly shifting grounds between the three of those. I totally understand the fans - if I was a comic book fan, I come from a more drama side of television and I understand there's passion there and we need that.\" \n© The CW She added that there's some fans that don't know about how the comic book plays out or any mythology, so it's good to show all aspects of the characters.\"But I think, by the same token, I come from the point of view of, hey, there are people that like action shows that might not know the mythology all that well, and we want to have some relatability on the show and people that can bring in people that don't know that as well and I think that's a viable aspect.\"Having left vigilante life behind, Oliver has no choice but to return to the streets of Star City when terrorist Damien Darhk (Neal McDonough) emerges from the shadows. Arrow returns to US screens on Wednesday, October 7 on The CW. Sky1 airs the series in the UK.Watch a promo for the new season below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:13:23.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
