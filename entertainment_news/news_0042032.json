It also admitted that more than 10 million cars sold globally might be equipped with the “defeat device.” A total of 700 local plaintiffs have so far filed a suit against Volkswagen Group, Audi Volkswagen Korea and local dealers, demanding their purchase contracts be nullified and the German carmaker return the money. \nModified Date: October 26, 2015 5:28 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:19:21.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
