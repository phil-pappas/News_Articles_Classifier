Along the way, arms dealers in Germany threatened him, the Israelis sold him secrets and the British had him smuggling packages across the Iron Curtain.In conjunction with the release of The Outsider and the opening of the new Steven Spielberg-Tom Hanks thriller Bridge of Spies, Forsyth picked his five favorite spy movies for THR:\n© Everett/Rex Shutterstock/Rex Features 'THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD' - 1965 1. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965)\n\"It was the first movie that said there is no glamour in espionage. It's grubby, dishonorable people doing dishonorable things, with trickery and deception and lying through your teeth. And it's got a magnificent performance by Richard Burton .\"\n© Michael Caine and Sue Lloyd 'The Ipcress File' (1965) 2. The Ipcress File (1965)\n\"Back then, spy movies presumed that anybody who was a British spy would [have] a beautiful, posh accent, and suddenly here was this insolent cockney, Harry Palmer [ Michael Caine ], which was groundbreaking.\"\n© Collection/Rex Shutterstock/Rex Features 'Funeral In Berlin' (1967) - Michael Caine 3. Funeral in Berlin (1966)\n\"When I was a journalist, I was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin in the year after the wall went up [in 1961]. Funeral in Berlin was about an agent [played by Caine] being pitted against the East German regime on the other side of the wall. It was memory lane for me to see familiar streets, Checkpoint Charlie and the wall.\"\n© Provided by The Hollywood Reporter\n4. Three Days of the Condor (1975)\n\"I'd always watch [ Robert ] Redford . [And] the wonderful John Houseman plays the director of the CIA. Houseman is actually a Romanian refugee. Where he learned English, God knows, because he always spoke with this extraordinary accent straight out of Oxford University.\"\n© Moviestore/Rex Shutterstock/Rex Features 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' (2011) -David Dencik and Gary Oldman 5. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)\n\"The story was a groundbreaker because one of the team of spies was a traitor. Which one? In real life, James Jesus Angleton [the CIA's counterintelligence chief from 1954 to 1975] became convinced there was a high-ranking traitor inside the CIA. He went to his grave convinced.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:35:39.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
