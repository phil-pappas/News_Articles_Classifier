Proescutors said he knowingly caused physical injury to a woman. \nHe was arrested again two weeks later and ordered to stay behind bars when prosecutors said he texted the woman 122 times and called her 35 times despite a no-contact order. \nCastronovo has been with Journey since 1998, when he replaced Steve Smith.
