This is mindboggling, even for me.”\nRon Brandwein, Health Insurance Information, Counseling and Assistance Program Brandwein said a decision should be based on several factors, such as the senior's overall health, travel habits, medications and which plans include their doctors.\nIt's likely everyone signing up for a plan will have questions specific to their situation or their choices. Brandwein talked through some of the common ones that he and his crew of volunteers get from younger people helping their loved ones:\nHow do we get started in the process?\nEach October, Medicare sends every eligible person a handbook that lays out what will be covered in the coming year.\nMedicare is for people 65 and older and for people with certain disabilities. For our purposes, we’ll focus on the 65-and-older group. So, ask your loved one if they have a Medicare card. You’ll need the Medicare number when you enroll for coverage.\nIf a person is collecting Social Security when they turn 65, they automatically will be issued a Medicare card.\nWhat if they are delaying collecting Social Security when they turn 65?\nIf the person wasn’t receiving health insurance coverage through active employment, in order to start Medicare and not be subject to penalties later on, he or she will need to contact the Social Security Administration within their initial enrollment period. That initial enrollment period is three months before they turn 65, the month they turn 65, and three months after.\nWhat if they worked past age 65 and had insurance from their job?\nIf your loved one had coverage from their employer, he or she will need to contact the Social Security Administration within eight months of that coverage ending to initiate Medicare without being subject to delays or penalties.\nWhat are the choices for Medicare coverage?\nThere are two broad choices. One is traditional Medicare, which covers hospitalization (Part A) and outpatient services such as visits to the doctor (Part B). Traditional Medicare does not include prescription drug coverage, so you’ll have to buy a separate drug plan. We’ll get to why that’s important.\nHowever, you can add a Medigap supplement to traditional Medicare to reduce the cost of co-pays and deductibles for Medicare-covered expenses.\nThe other is Medicare Advantage, which is offered by private insurance companies that are approved by Medicare. These plans have Parts A and B, and include drug coverage. Medicare Advantage also may include extras, such as allowances for health clubs or wellness programs.\nIs traditional Medicare free?\nPart A coverage (hospitalization) typically is free for anyone who has paid into Social Security for 10 or more years.\nPart B has a monthly premium. If you are collecting Social Security, the premium is automatically withdrawn. Even people who have a Medicare Advantage Plan pay that premium. Plus, with traditional Medicare, you’ll need to help your loved one select a drug plan, which has an additional cost.\nMy parents have had the same Medicare plan for years. Why do we need to go over the choices?\nOnce they sign up, they’ll be automatically re-enrolled during the next year’s sign-up process. But plans don’t stay the same, and neither do your parents. Because premiums increase and benefits change, your parents may be paying more than necessary or not getting the types of services they need or want.\nMy parents are moving to Rochester from outside this area. Do I need to know anything special?\nSomeone eligible for Medicare has to buy the insurance in the area of their primary residence. So if that person is moving here, they’ll have to change their insurance. If that’s not happening now, the person can use a special enrollment period that lasts for two months around the time of the move.\nSo, what do I have to be thinking of to help them choose a plan?\nYou may be asking your parents or grandparents things that aren’t always talked about in families. But it’s important to know those things, in order to make the best selection.\nStart with their overall health. If you don’t live with them, you may not know how often are they hospitalized or see a doctor. Just like with your own insurance, there are charges for services. Plans that charge higher premiums have lower copayments, and plans with low (or no) premiums have higher copayments. It’s a tradeoff. If your person doesn’t use many health care services, it may make sense to go for a lower premium and pay more on the few occasions when you need care. Do they travel? Does that involve only day trips, or are they snowbirds? All plans offer emergency or urgent care for vacations or road trips. Some plans have a benefit for people who spend time out of the area, but that benefit varies by company. What’s on their prescriptions list? Even if they don’t take any medication now, it pays to sign up for drug coverage (called Medicare Part D). If they don’t sign up when they enroll in Medicare and eventually want medication coverage, they’ll pay a penalty that can add hundreds of dollars a year, every year. If they’re not using any, or many medications now, they may want to consider a Medicare Advantage plan with a zero-dollar premium . That way, they are not spending extra on drug coverage and they’re protecting themselves from the penalty in the future. If they are taking a lot of medications, know that drugs are classified in tiers that range from generics in tier 1 to very specialized (and expensive) drugs in tier 5. The insurer classifies the drugs into tiers, and the tier determines how much your loved one pays. So check how different companies classify the drugs your loved one uses. If they have trouble paying for their medication, sign them up for the New York state Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage , The plan helps with copayments and can pay the Part D premium for low-income seniors. Make sure your loved one’s doctors are in the plan you’re looking at . Double-check with the doctors (hospitals and other services the person uses) and with the insurer. If your loved one sees a provider who is not part of the plan, he or she could be responsible for the entire bill. What do we do when we’ve chosen a plan?\nIf your loved one currently is enrolled in a plan and wants to switch, do not contact that current insurer to cancel. Have the individual contact the new plan of choice, either via phone or online, and sign up for that plan. Once that sign-up is processed, Medicare will be notified of the change and will then notify the previous plan of the change and the previous plan will eventually issue a notice of cancellation. This is to make sure there is no period in which the individual has no coverage at all.\nPSINGER@Gannett.com\nFor more information\nThe Medicare enrollment period is Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.\nLifespan, which provides non-medical advice to seniors and their caregivers, is offering free Medicare 101 seminars.
