The \" 19 Kids and Counting \" star shared with her 1.7 million followers on Instagram on Thursday, October 22 a picture comparing an ultrasound image of her baby and images of her and husband Ben Seewald as babies. The ultrasound image showed her baby's face but it was unclear yet. Next to the ultrasound image were images of her and Ben as babies looking at the camera. The pregnant reality TV star captioned it, \"Sitting here dreaming about the moment when we will meet our little one face-to-face... and wondering if our baby will carry more Seewald or Duggar characteristics and features!\" Jessa then wondered if her baby would have mixed features of hers and Ben's. \"I'm thinking #BabySeewald will be a sweet mix of the two of us! What do you think?\" she added, before ending the caption with the countdown of the baby's due date, \"Just 10 more days till baby's due date!\" Foto kiriman Jessa Seewald (@jessaseewald) pada Okt 22, 2015 pada 9:24 PDT The ultrasound image went online just a week after the couple celebrated the impending arrival of their first child with a fall-themed baby shower at a friend's barn in Highfill, Arkansas. The event was filmed for Jessa and Jill Duggar 's upcoming TLC special \" Jill & Jessa: Counting On \". The fun-filled baby shower reportedly included games like a milk-drinking competition for the men and a diaper-changing challenge for the women. The final competition pitted Ben against other two contenders to make the best baby food, said a source. Jessa and Ben haven't disclosed the baby's sex yet. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:45:24.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
