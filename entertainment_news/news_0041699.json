At New York PaleyFest on Sunday, October 11, Lucy Hale gave an update on Aria's romantic relationship status with on-/off-boyfriend Ezra ( Ian Harding ). Hale told PEOPLE that her character hadn't reconciled with Ezra during the 5-year time jump, but teased that if it happened, it would be legal considering Aria's 23 years old now. \"It's finally not creepy! We love it,\" she said with a laugh. Further dishing on her character, the actress shared, \"Where they sort of left off, she's going away to college. That's what happens, you break up with the person you love, you go in different directions, and so I don't really know what their contact was in those five years. I want to say they probably didn't talk at all, because there is a scene in an episode back where she realizes he's back in town and you can tell there's still that butterflies-in-her-stomach feeling.\" Hale added that Aria's \"in a relationship\" with another man, and that \"she's very happy and in love.\" While she didn't share details of Aria's new beau, she revealed that Aria would eventually meet her ex Ezra again. \"It's sort of a different kind of a relationship,\" she explained. \"You've never seen them have a mature friendship like this, and they start working with each other.\" During the show's panel at PaleyFest, the creatives behind the drama series talked about introducing a new mystery in season 6B. \"The idea is you can actually start from this season right now and meet these girls. These young women are coming back to a town, very relatable, post college, helping an old friend, someone from high school, and having to relive some high school experiences,\" executive producer Oliver Goldstick said, \"So people who are coming into the show now new... I think the relationships that are here right now too, start off at great places.\" Exec producer I. Marlene King added, \"It's lighter in some ways [season 6B] because we are starting a new mystery...we get to rely little bit more heavily on the soap as we start this new mystery.\" King also addressed when the show would likely end. \"I think the fans will stay with us for so many more seasons,\" she said, \"but I think as a group we'll make a decision on when it's time to end, and right now it's sounding like season 7.\" Fans shouldn't be too upset though because even if it ended, \"there could be versions of the show that go on in a different form, so everything is possible.\" Also at the panel, they played a deleted scene from season 6A finale that reveals another of CeCe's accomplices. It shows Officer Barry Maple in a car with CeCe, giving her a set of shocking instructions. \"Pretty Little Liars\" returns with the remainder of its sixth season January 12 at 8 P.M. ET on ABC Family which will change its name into Freeform beginning in 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:31.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
