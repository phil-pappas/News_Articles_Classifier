The mayor pitched the CPS tax in his budget address more than a month ago, but his comments Monday mark the first time he’s indicated CPS would borrow against the new revenue stream to embark on a building program that would be more expansive than just $45 million per year.\n“The financial officers will work through how to deal with that. My guess is, like other things that they have done, they’ll bond so we can actually meet the obligations today, so kids and teachers are not being held in the penalty box, when you have the resources and capability to actually make a modern school system,” said Emanuel, who appoints the Chicago Board of Education.\n“My guess is CPS will do that, because there is no reason to hold back teachers, schools and parents when you have the ability to address a modern school for their children to learn in. So, I assume that will happen,\" he added.\nPreviously, the Emanuel administration would not say whether he’d direct CPS to borrow money for a building program. The district remains saddled with a heavy debt load, a massive budget deficit and a junk credit rating, all of which makes borrowing more expensive.\nThe mayor and his administration have declined to say which schools would benefit or which projects would be tackled first once the new CPS “capital improvement tax levy” is enacted. Emanuel has offered generalities about the money being spent on overcrowding and air conditioning. The Emanuel administration also has declined to provide a list of what it considers to be the city’s overcrowded schools.\nCPS to approve new charter school 'warning' policy Juan Perez Jr. Chicago Public Schools officials expect to approve two charter school operators' expansion plans for 2016 this week while announcing a policy said to allow a faster crackdown on low-performing charters.\nNearly a dozen new charter campuses were on track to receive a vote by the Chicago Board of...\nChicago Public Schools officials expect to approve two charter school operators' expansion plans for 2016 this week while announcing a policy said to allow a faster crackdown on low-performing charters.\nNearly a dozen new charter campuses were on track to receive a vote by the Chicago Board of...\n(Juan Perez Jr.) As Emanuel tries to collect enough votes to approve a budget laden with tax and fee hikes, a school construction program would give him a potential avenue to bring aldermen into his camp by giving them new projects to take credit for in their ward. The mayor was asked Monday whether he had discussed specific school projects with aldermen in the run-up to the budget vote, but he did not answer.\nEmanuel addressed the issue during a news conference in the middle of a Lakeview street to draw attention to tree trimming services the mayor said would be increased in next year’s budget. Joining him was Ald. Tom Tunney, 44th, who acknowledged he had yet to decide whether he’d vote for Emanuel’s budget, and said school improvements would factor into his decision.\n“I still have not made a firm decision on it. People in this neighborhood are concerned about public safety …” Tunney said. “I’m pushing for commitments at Lakeview High School to make sure it is a competitive high school. So, we have work to do.”\nMorning Spin: Rauner, Madigan can't even agree on where, how to meet Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield.\nTopspin\nIt's Monday, Oct. 26, two days before the Chicago City Council votes on Mayor Rahm Emanuel's record property tax increase.\nHow dysfunctional...\nWelcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield.\nTopspin\nIt's Monday, Oct. 26, two days before the Chicago City Council votes on Mayor Rahm Emanuel's record property tax increase.\nHow dysfunctional...\nRead the story Emanuel added another new wrinkle to the CPS tax issue Monday. He said some of the proceeds from the tax increase would go toward expanding high-speed broadband access.\nLast week, CPS announced the FCC had awarded the district a $37.7 million federal grant, which would ensure “every student in every classroom will have access to high-speed broadband and Wi-Fi.” Emanuel said part of the new tax money would go toward local matching funds required by the grant.\n“That’s going to be part of the school modernization, our local match,” Emanuel said. “Every school will receive some benefit, meaning if you have wiring today, you’ll be upgraded for the highest speed. If you have no wiring, you’ll finally get it.”\n Rahm Emanuel Chicago Public Schools Thomas M.
