But the organisation has now been reduced to a rundown shed. Actor Dileep has now come up with an offer to revive the organisation and said he will be helping Kanchanamala to give a second lease of life to it.\nThe offer has been applauded from all quarters, and many have even criticised the makers of the film for reaping profits without lifting a finger to help the real life people behind it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:26:58.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
