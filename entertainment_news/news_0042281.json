Photo: Richard Cornish \n1. Containers \nFour brightly painted shipping containers sit on the foreshore at Port Melbourne, just opposite Station Pier. This is ARTcontained​, a temporary art gallery and performance space where next weekend the Asanti Dance Theatre will perform a series of short African-drumming workshops. You can also have your portrait drawn by pop and comic artist Michael Fikaris​ for $20. Bring your dog and have it drawn by fellow comic artist Ben Hutchings. The programming continues until mid-April, with musicians such as blues guitarist Boadz​ (pictured) performing in this busy hub-by-the-bay. \nportphillip.vic.gov.au/ARTcontained.htm  \nMelbourne from Webb Dock Walk.

Good pub \nAdvertisement Mr Lawrence at The London is the new name for the London Hotel, a former wharfies' pub that now reeks of understated cool with its exposed steel beams, white tiles and 1950s Italian smallgoods ads. Come here for a good choice of craft beers and ciders on tap, an excellent wine list and fresh and healthy Middle Eastern-inspired food. Take a bench on the footpath and watch the joggers, rollerbladers and walkers pass by. Over summer the function room upstairs, with its large windows that look over Station Pier open to the sea breeze, can be a pleasant place for a quiet drink and plates to share. \n92 Beach Street, 9077 4992, mrlawrence.com.au \nBarber Lee Wilson from Uncle Rocco's.

It's one of the highlights of Westgate Park, a 56-hectare native bush and wetland park created from a former tip. The park's freshwater lake is home to a staggering number of native birds, including pied oystercatchers, cattle egrets, New Holland honeyeaters and superb wrens wading in the water or darting about the native scrub. Gravel paths meander through the park and there are barbecue and toilet facilities. One path leads under the bridge, offering a dramatic view of its monolithic pylons. \nparkweb.vic.gov.au \nThe view of Westgate Bridge from Westgate Park. Photo: Richard Cornish \n4. Good barber \nBarbers tell good stories. Lee Wilson has a great one: his own. He used to work in London as an anti-terror agent. He broke his back. He moved to Australia. He broke it again. He couldn't walk. Then he hung around Uncle Rocco's Barber Shop. He loved the camaraderie, the chat, the fun and the vibe so much that he retrained as a barber. He now cuts and grooms in that same barber shop, one of Melbourne's best and most dapper. It's called Uncle Rocco's Barber Shop after owner Fab Sfameni's uncle, who has a barber shop in New Jersey. Come here for sharp cuts, good coffee at the cafe next door, a peek into Globe's skate ramp behind the barber and Uncle Rocco's brand denim, T-shirts and shoes. \n1 Fennell Street, 0403 283 837, Mon-Fri 7.30am-4.30pm, appointments only, uncleroccos.com.au \nArtists' studios at Gasworks Arts Park are open to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Photo: Richard Cornish \n5. Gasworks \nTechnically in Albert Park, Gasworks Arts Park is a precinct with galleries, theatre, cafe and artist-in-residence studios dotted around a large site that used to be the suburb's gasworks. Dotted with trees and lots of open space, the park is shielded from the outside world by old factory walls. Artists such as Wen Shobbrook work in the factory buildings. You can visit most of them when they open their studios to the public on the third Saturday of each month. This coincides with the Gasworks Farmers' Market, one of the best in the state. \n21 Graham Street, Albert Park, 8606 4200, gasworks.org.au \n6. Dock on the bay \nMost of us don't think of Melbourne as a maritime city, but the view from the newly built observation deck at the tip of Webb Point reveals a city wrapped around Port Phillip Bay. This four-storey structure – which offers views over the city, across to Williamstown and down the bay – is reached via a 600-metre walking track from the car park at Perce White Reserve. Construction at the Webb Dock makes it noisy during the day. When the diggers stop, this is a peaceful spot to watch ships and pleasure craft heading up the bay, and cormorants resting on the rocks. \nNext week: Marysville\n@Foodcornish \n6reasons@richardcornish.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:30:38.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
