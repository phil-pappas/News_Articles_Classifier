In an interview on Monday after the incident, he acknowledged that while it was not \"okay to talk to people like that\", he did so because he was angry.\n\"It's exam time next week [and] they are preventing people from coming onto campus,\" Ouwehand said.\nThe video of Ouwehand was recorded on Monday morning by Twitter user Raeesa Pather.
