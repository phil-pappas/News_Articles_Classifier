The couple romantically kiss and embrace as he hands her a bunch of red roses.\nBritt was yesterday walked down the aisle by her father Steve, who also officiated the service in front of family and friends, among them country muso Bill Chambers.\nCatherine Britt and James Beverley seal the deal with a kiss. “The wedding has kept me positive, having something to look forward to. I’m pumped for it. I can’t wait to marry the love of my life,” she told Confidential ahead of yesterday’s nuptials.\n“I invested in a really beautiful wig for my wedding because I wanted to feel normal for the day, but I’m also kind of embracing the fact that you can’t ignore the elephant in the room — I am bald and that is the way it is.”\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?
