Michener Art Museum\nDOYLESTOWN, Pa. , Oct. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The James A. Michener Art Museum is excited to host Blanket Statements: New Quilts by Kaffe Fassett and Historical Quilts from the Collection of the Quilt Museum and Gallery, York, UK from November 14 through February 21 . The Michener will be one of only two museum venues in the United States for this stellar exhibition, and have supplemented it with extensive programming events and a sister exhibition, Pattern Pieces . Together, Blanket Statements and Pattern Pieces offer a celebration of patchwork and quilting, highlighting their status as art objects and as inspiration for other artistic mediums.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275468\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275469\nBlanket Statements features 20 new patchwork designs by the American-born, internationally known textile artist Kaffe Fassett, created in response to 15 historical quilts, dating from 1780 to 1949, which he selected from the Quilter's Guild collection. After their U.S. showings, the historical quilts featured in Blanket Statements will be archived in England and unavailable for public viewing.\nFassett is one of the most prolific and renowned patchwork artists of his time, garnering praise for revolutionizing quilt making with his bold and innovative use of vibrant color. His philosophy has inspired quilters and patchwork artists around the word to defy traditional quilting conventions. Fassett was born in San Francisco in 1937 and settled in England in 1964. In 1988 he became the first living textile artists to have a one-man show at the Victoria & Albert Museum. In 2013, Fassett was awarded the Turner Medal.\nKirsten M. Jensen , Ph.D., the Michener's Gerry & Marguerite Lenfest Chief Curator notes, \"Kaffe Fassett possesses an incredible eye for color and design; his selection of the historical quilts and his stunning responses to them reflect that sensibility. Visitors who might not be attracted to textiles initially will find the patterns and color in these pieces breathtaking - and the fact that a number of the quilts were pieced in Bucks County adds an exciting dimension to the exhibition.\"\nBlanket Statements is generously supported by Visit Bucks County, The Coby Foundation, Ltd., and Penn Color, Inc. Additional support is provided by Bucks County Foundation, Silverman Family Partnerships, Harriet and Charles Ermentrout , Byrne Sewing Connection, and GloriousColor.com.
