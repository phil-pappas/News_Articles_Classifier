According to TMZ , the \" Lawless \" actor was \"out of control and disobeyed police\" on the street. The arrest happened at around 7:45 P.M. outside a bar on 6th street. A source told the website that Shia was clearly intoxicated or high on drugs. The actor reportedly jaywalked in front of the police after he ran down the street. The cops warned him to stop it but he continued and acted bizarrely. The 29-year-old actor was then subdued and handcuffed. In some photos and a video obatined by the website, Shia wore a blue T-shirt and black shorts. He sported black socks and shoes of the same hue. He turned his face down when he was brought into the police's car. It wasn't the first time Shia was arrested for public intoxication. Last year, the actor was arrested at the Broadway musical \"Cabaret\" in New York. He was smoking cigarettes and yelling at the actors when watching the musical. He entered a guilty plea in September and was ordered to complete a six-month treatment for his drinking problem. His case was dismissed and sealed after he displayed good behavior in six months. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:11:00.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
