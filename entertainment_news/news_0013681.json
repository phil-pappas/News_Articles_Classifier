He says that I RSVP’ed that I would be in attendance at the Tybee Island political forum on Oct. 12. I don’t know where he got his information, but he was misinformed. It is simply a lie. I do not accuse Barton of being the liar, only that he promoted the lie. If you have documentation that I RSVP’ed before the event, please publish it.\nI wrote Shirley Wright on September 28 and again on October 5, explicitly telling her we would not participate unless the Forever Tybee Political Action Committee agreed that all questions be asked to all candidates. That’s not an unfair request, would you say?\nIf the questions are worth asking, they are worth asking of all candidates, unless you have an ulterior motive.\nWhat Freda Rutherford (Chairman, Forever Tybee Political Action Committee) orchestrated two years ago at the “debate” was nothing less than a freak show. Barton is an amusing and entertaining guy, with a very quick wit and a stylish persona, but he is not a fair or balanced moderator. This may be entertainment for him, but for the citizens of Tybee, their representation is extremely serious. This is not ancient Rome, where the crowd cheers for people to be eaten by lions. It makes for great theater, but not much content.\nMrs. Rutherford has spent the past week trying to get me disqualified. How is that for openness and transparency in government? She has no interest in the democratic process, whatsoever. Rough and tumble politics has to be stomached to a point, but the total loss of all integrity by Mrs. Rutherford and her inner-circle is disgraceful.\nRemember the old adage, “When you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas.”\nSTEPHEN FRIEDMAN\nTybee Island\nEditor’s note: According to copies of an email exchange between Ms. Wright and Mr. Friedman last month, Ms. Wright invited Mr. Friedman to participate in the forum on Sept. 21 at 10:42 a.m. That same day, seven minutes later, at 10:49 a.m., Mr. Friedman emailed Ms. Wright with the message, “I certainly plan to participate. Greatly appreciate the opportunity.” On Oct. 2 at 2:30 p.m., 10 days before the forum, Mr. Friedman emailed Ms. Wright that she had “received from me the guidelines for debate that are acceptable to Wanda Doyle, Barry Brown, John Bremer and me. I do not know where the Forever Tybee candidates stand on the issue, but I am sure you will be able to find out. If your group is not agreeable to the ground rules that are acceptable to the four independent candidates, please let me know at your earliest convenience and I will find out if they are inclined to participate or not.”\nWhere is your pride, Savannah?\nHighway 204 West/Abercorn is an embarrassment. It seems like every day a five- or 10-minute drive leaving Savannah from 3:30 p.m. on takes almost 30 minutes or more to get to King George Boulevard or Interstate 95.\nMy opinion is that the traffic lights need to be timed differently for this time of day to move the traffic smoother/faster from town. You will cut frustration and all the other stuff that goes with driving 204/Abercorn this time of day.\nThe traffic conditions could be a deal maker or deal breaker to newcomers coming in off I-95. Standstill traffic does not make friends for Savannah.\nMorning traffic coming into town isn’t any better — it is ridiculous. Leaders of the city and county get paid too much money.\nFirst impressions of newcomers like any other situation will make a decision whether or not to set up housekeeping here or go somewhere else where traffic can be a lot smoother and less frustrating.\nSpeaking of housekeeping, the trash along this route is something else when the traffic is at a standstill — it’s magnified.\nWhere is the pride?\nDARRELL PHELPS\nSavannah\nCapture the terrorists; harvest their organs\nThere are currently more than 120,000 people waiting for lifesaving organ transplants in the U.S. Of these, more than 100,000 await kidney transplants.\nTwelve people die every day because there is no kidney available.\nThere are thousands of terrorists killing innocent people. Why not capture them and use their organs for non-terrorist Americans?\nI’ll tell you why: The bleeding heart liberals would be outraged by this proposal — the same liberals who look the other way while innocent American babies are being butchered by Planned Parenthood for their organs.\nCLYDE PHILLIPS\nSavannah\nSave a life — arm yourself\nThis letter is in response to Pepi Streiff’s rant on enacting gun control (“ Elect leaders who support gun control ,” Oct. 10).\nFirst, the Second Amendment gives all citizens the right to bear arms, not the NRA or Tsar Obama. Gun free zones are the worst idea “doves” have concocted ever. Criminals and crazies don’t follow gun laws, victims do!\nSecond, the will of the people is leave us and our guns alone.\nThird, support our military and law enforcement officers, because when you don’t, all hell will break loose.\nFourth, arm yourself! Get a gun, learn how to use, clean, carry and load it correctly. You may just save yourself, your family, your friends or a stranger.\nJEFF MELL\nSavannah\nCounty: Wake up and remove dangerous obstructions\nAbout three years ago I was exiting Veterans Parkway southbound and turned left onto Chatham Parkway toward Garrard Avenue. As I proceeded through the intersection I noticed an ambulance and police cars at the intersection.\nThere was a motorcycle and an automobile involved in an accident. The motorcycle driver was killed. I was determined to find out why this happened.\nAfter a lot of study and investigation I found without a doubt what the cause was.\nThe groundskeepers had planted shrubs or bushes in the median, which had grown so large that an individual turning left in either direction from Chatham Parkway had dramatically reduced vision of the oncoming traffic. I wrote a letter to the editor and within two weeks the bushes were cut down. The conditions are today worse than they were then.\nWithout an exclusive left turn green arrow, you are making an exceedingly dangerous left turn.\nUnless someone in the county finally wakes up and removes these visual obstructions more fatalities will occur.\nROBERT COWART\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:17:52.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
