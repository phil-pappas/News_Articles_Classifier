I could feel evil chambering through my gut. \n\"Can traveler's diarrhea start before you've even gone anywhere?\" I asked my dog. \nHe whined and went outside while I popped a couple of Imodium and tossed the bottle into the suitcase, along with some wet wipes, Pepto-Bismol and Poo-pourri. \nThe flight to San Diego was uneventful, if spilling the whole bottle of Poo-pourri in your backpack counts as uneventful. (My apologies to everyone on the plane.) \nWe crossed the border into Tijuana, skipping the donkey bar and heading straight to my friends' vacation house. We drank, played cards, drank, went down to the beach, drank, fixed dinner, drank and played shuffleboard. Then we drank some more. And the next morning, to nobody's surprise, I had a bad case of Party Belly. Fritz \nOver the next few days, my stomach was the only one acting up, but then the boys went to the fish market and brought home a glorious tuna, which gave a couple of the others reason to read novellas in the bathroom. Then the last night, some potentially unwashed lettuce took a few more of us down to Poo Town. \n\"Let's spend a few hours in San Diego, eating huge, greasy burgers before our flight!\" said Kevin. \n\"Yay!\" screamed everyone but Camille. She wanted to lay in the mini-van and pray for death. \nBack at work the next day, I got word that Tim was considering going to the ER because his belly was in knots, his ass was crying and his poop was black. \n\"That's just the Pepto,\" we told him. \"And Mexico. And traveling. Stay away from sauces for a few days.\" Advertisement \nKevin was the only one untouched â€” we later discovered his penance was merely delayed. He'd made it back to Colorado without incident, went to a party and stayed up till 4 a.m. The next morning, back at the party house to pick up his wife's car, he felt a churning. He saw a cat cross the street. A leaf flutter to the ground. And then his belly churned a second time. The back door of the house slammed and Kevin decided to knock on the front door. His belly churned again. He knocked on the back door. His belly knocked back. He knocked on the windows. \n\"I can make it, they just have to let me in,\" he whispered. \nBut nobody was home. And now it was too late to get into his truck and race to the gas station. \nThe devil inside stretched his wings, doubling Kevin over in pain, as he knocked, and knocked, and knocked. And then he felt it. He didn't have a second to lose, so he skittered into the alley, squatted behind a car and pooped, using leaves to wash his bum and giggling to himself a little until he realized someone in the high rise across the street could be watching him. So he pretended to be throwing up. Grabbing a Chinese takeout box from a nearby trash can, he scooped the evidence up, chucked it back in the trash and ran away to find some real toilet paper. \nWe'll probably go again next year. \nRead more Fritz: coloradodaily.com/columnists .
