Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles helped co-write the song which is included in their album \" Made in the A.M. \" due November 13. The song is rumored to be about Taylor Swift , who dated Styles for several months in 2012. The lyrics include, \"If you like cameras flashing every time we go out/If you're looking for someone to write your break-up songs about baby I'm perfect.\" Swift is indeed infamous for writing songs about her exes and some of her tracks are believed to be inspired by Styles. The 1D member once responded to the rumors, \"We write from personal experience, and I think everyone does, so it would be hypocritical of us to be like, 'Oh you can't write about us.' And she's really good, so they're good songs. I'm really lucky in that sense.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:49:26.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
