Voiced by Brian Blessed (WITH HIS VERY LOUD VOICE!) and David Rintoul, Sir Boris and Sir Morris are the clumsiest clots alive. Their dog and hamster, each with its own suit of armour, are not much better. These back to back episodes of the cult show offer plenty of slapstick for younger viewers while keeping adults chuckling along as well. Alexander Armstrong narrates.\nGlasgow Film Theatre, October 12-16\nThe Walk (3D) (PG)\ntwo stars\nDir: Robert Zemeckis\nWith: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley\nRuntime: 123 minutes\nWIRE-walker Philippe Petit’s real-life bid to cross the Twin Towers in 1974 was famously, and Oscar-winningly, recounted in James Marsh’s 2008 documentary, Man on Wire. This dramatised reworking by Robert Zemeckis clearly has a lot to live up to, and fails. The 3D is used to impressive effect - there are lots of stomach churning gazes to the ground, a joy for anyone afraid of heights - but from the moment Joseph Gordon-Levitt opens his mouth to reveal an Allo Allo French accent, The Walk is going nowhere fast.\nThe Nightmare (15)\ntwo stars\nDir: Rodney Ascher\nWith: Yatoya Toy, Siegfried Peters\nShare article Runtime: 88 minutes\nFRESH from dissecting The Shining in his fascinating documentary, Room 237, Rodney Ascher turns his gaze to nightmares. Not just any old night terrors, though, but sleep paralysis, during which sufferers see a rogue’s gallery of shadowy figures menacing their sleeping hours. Spooky enough, but other people’s dreams are rather like other people’s holiday snaps, and once you’ve heard one version of the tale, you have pretty much heard them all. It would have helpful, too, to go wider than victims to learn what science has to say about what causes these distressing episodes.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-08T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:37:27.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
