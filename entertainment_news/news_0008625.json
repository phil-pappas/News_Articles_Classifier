Little Shop of Horrors runs for 10 performances at Central New York Playhouse, Syracuse October 16-31, 2015. Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 8pm, Sundays at 2pm. Plot: A deviously delicious Broadway and Hollywood sci-fi smash musical, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS has devoured the hearts of theatre goers for over 30 years. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken (Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN) are the creative geniuses behind what has become one of the most popular shows in the world.
