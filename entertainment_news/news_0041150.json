He plays a young student who will eventually be captivated by a seductive and mysterious model (Phoebe Walker).\nBenjamin told Bulletin Entertainment that he has a “bunch of intimate scenes” in the movie.\n“There are a lot of new challenges for me in this movie. One of it me being (naked)… In any case, intimate scenes ay talagang mahirap for me. We probably had one intimate scene in every shoot so that’s a lot,” he said.\nTo prepare for the scenes, the 26-year-old took special workshops under veteran actor Leo Martinez.\n“They really made sure we were prepared for the scenes… That way, when we go on set, hindi na siya awkward,” Benjamin said.\nHe finds Phoebe a “great actress” who has “a lot of potential,” and someone “to keep an eye on.”\nDirected by award-winning production designer and graphic artist Cesar Hernando, Benjamin says “Gayuma” is not all about sexy. “There are a lot of other surprises,” he said, noting that it is “a really good story,” and “very artistic.”\nFuture plans\nThe “Heneral Luna” star said he’d like to do action films in the future. “There’s barely any, so action film talaga. I hope we would be able to revive that (genre),” he said.\nBenjamin is not really choosy with roles but he has a clear sense of what makes a good project. “I always say na it’s parang relationship eh, may destiny ’yan. ’Pag na-meet mo ’yung tamang director, writer, script, it’s all meant to happen. So sana there is a script that is good or still being written, na hopefully we find each other.”\nHe added, “Pero if I say na ganito ang gusto ko mangyari sa career ko, that’s very assuming eh. I’m just very grateful of whatever is given to me, ’yun naman ’yun eh. And I do everything that I can to make sure the roles that come my way, I do my best in it.”\nQCIFF 2015\nAside from “Gayuma,” this year’s QCIFF lineup includes “Kapatiran” by Pepe Diokno, “Water Lemon” by Lemuel Lorca, Chuck Gutierrez’s “Iisa,” and Mihk Vergara’s “Patintero: Ang Alamat Ni Meng Patalo.”\nAlso competing is the first lead starrer of Amante Pulido, “Matangtubig,” which is directed by Jet Leyco. There’s also “Apocalypse Child” by Monster Jimenez and Mario Cornejo; and “Sleepless” by Prime Cruz.\nIn the documentary film category, the finalists are: “Translacion: Ang Paglakad Sa Altar Ng Alanganin” by Will Fredo; “Of Cats, Dogs, Farm Animals, And Sashimi” by Perry Dizon; “The Crescent Rising” by Sheron Dayoc; Universe Baldoza’s “Audio Perpetua;” and “Bingat” by Choy Pangilinan, Qubry Quesada, Joolia Demigillo, and Abet Umil.\nThe QCIFF 2015 runs from Oct. 22 to 31 at Robinson’s Galleria, Gateway Mall and Trinoma Cinemas. The QCinema Awards Night will be held at the QC Interactive Museum on Oct. 28.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:37:38.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
