Well, let’s look at the facts.\nThe way she went about hiring Sydney Blumenthal while secretary of state, and the way she exchanged classified information with him, even though he lacked a security clearance, were illegal.\nThe Benghazi investigators also discovered that Hillary was using an unsecured private email for official government business, also illegal and in violation of State Department regulations. It was later discovered that she had a personal email server at her home in upstate New York. It was also discovered that a State Department IT expert was sent to Hillary’s home to hook up her personal server, something which she then hid.\nThese are just a few of the illegal actions taken by Hillary. To date, Hillary is possibly looking at 13 felony violations. This is what she refers to as a vast right-wing conspiracy against her.\nHillary should not fear the Republicans; her biggest fear should be the FBI. Hillary did all of this by herself, and she has no one to blame except herself.\nDavid Baker\nRiverside\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
