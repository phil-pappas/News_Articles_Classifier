Her off-the-cuff delivery of her corrosive views and general sociopathic tendencies add the substance to the first half. It helps that the script is also good, but only in the safe hands of the cast. I won’t spoil the second half; suffice to say that the four supporting actors, Peggy (Izzy Weaver), Sidney (Paul Baker), Douglas (Ian Wilson) and Eduardo (Christopher Gardener) all brought unique characterisations that greatly enhanced the hilarity. To have such good rapport and strong delivery must surely be in part down to the direction (James Norton).
