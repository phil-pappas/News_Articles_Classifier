The city has declined to act on the revised document in the time since, citing uncertainty about the county’s willingness to participate in the raises.\nTo try to bring an end to the stalemate earlier this month, commission Chairman Al Scott attended a meeting of the City Council, where he assured Savannah officials he was in support of the pay increases and agreed to convene the policy committee to discuss the matter.\n“What I wanted to do was be able to take (the pay increases) immediately to the county commission for approval,” Scott said at the policy committee meeting Wednesday. “But I first wanted the policy committee to approve it, so I will have the sanction of the policy committee before I bring it to the county commission for approval. ... That in itself puts us on record of supporting the pay increases retroactive to July 1, which is what I’m trying to accomplish.”\nBy this week, Scott said, his staff had determined that the county’s true share of the costs for 2015 — a figure he said incorporated each government’s share of the police department’s costs and the average vacancies from July to December — was $246,515.99.\nSavannah City Manager Stephanie Cutter, however, countered that his proposal double-counted the vacancies, and the true cost to the county for the second half of 2015 is just more than $279,000.\nScott wasted little time in accepting that figure.\n“I’m perfectly willing to get staff to work that out, to entertain a motion for the $279,000, because it all has to be reconciled at the end of the year,” the chairman said. “I don’t have a compelling argument over $25,000-$30,000. I’m more than willing to move on that.”\nIn addition, the committee’s four members agreed to move ahead with the development of a request for proposals for a law enforcement consultant as outlined in the police merger agreement.\nThe agreement requires the two governments to “mutually select and evenly share the expense of an independent law enforcement consultant,” who will develop an evidenced-based formula for splitting costs for the police department by the third year of the new agreement.\nLeft unresolved at the close of the committee’s half-hour meeting was a request from Cutter for splitting the costs for new mobile data devices for officers in the field and for the formation of a new a police unit to investigate street-level drugs, sex trafficking and prostitution.\nThe committee opted to allow staffers to review the programs to come up with financing proposals.\nAlso unclear was which governing body would take up the committee’s recommendations first.\nAlthough the city council had been waiting for the county to show interest in the pay increases prior to approving the police merger agreement, the council will not take up the document at its meeting today, Cutter said.\nScott and County Manager Lee Smith could not be reached for comment Wednesday on when the county might take up the cost for the salary increases.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:05:32.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
