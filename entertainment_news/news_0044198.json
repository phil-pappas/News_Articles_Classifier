But if you guessed an iPad, you'd also be right. Either way, the first photo from Bridget Jones's Baby has been released, and it features Renee Zellweger clutching her very own bundle of joy.\nUniversal Pictures tweeted the photo Friday, along with an announcement that filming on the third installment on the British series had begun.\n'Bridget Jones's Baby' has started filming. pic.twitter.com/3bNvb3uNt9\n— UniversalPicturesUK (@universaluk) October 2, 2015\nHere's everything coming to (and leaving) Netflix in October\nThe iPad is a nice update from the old pen and paper diary, though we wish it didn't obscure Zellweger so much. Ever since we saw her new face , which she claims is the result of mere aging and happiness, we've been curious if we'd recognize the Bridget we once knew and loved when she returned to the big screen. This photo shows that twinkle in her eye, but not much more.\nZellweger will be reprising her role as the titular character, and Colin Firth has signed on to come back at Mark Darcy. Hugh Grant will not be in the film, but Patrick Dempsey is attached to it , indicating he may be assuming the role of \"love interest.\"\nReportedly, the movie will not follow the plot of the third book in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones series, where Jones is dealing with being a single mother after Darcy's death.\nWATCH: What happened to Renee Zellweger's face?
