I think this is very sad, and it's not OK. We had five elks, now we have only three.\nStrathmann said the zoo intends to seek compensation for the slain two slain moose.\nArne Nysted, chairman of the wildlife tribunal in Troms County, said the body does not intend to seek punishment against the hunters, as the incident appears to have been an accident.\nHowever, Katrine Grimnes of the Malselv police said no decisions will be made regarding potential prosecution until the hunters have been interviewed.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740281&h=Hunters+accidentally+shot+two+moose+through+zoo+fence", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740281", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1740281&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:06:57.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
