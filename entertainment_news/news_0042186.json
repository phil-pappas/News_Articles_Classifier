A girl being brought up as a man, getting married to another girl is a hard subject to convince the audience. \nBut once you believe the plot, the film might appeal better to you. Secondly, the songs and the back ground music did not do any good to the film, which are in fact key for a historic film to create that emotional connect. \nGunasekhar narrates the film so plain and missed on the cinematic highs audience expect. Apparently, the liberties he has taken were stock and hence did not help him win the attention of the viewers. \nThe director should have concentrated on narrating the story from the perspective of highlighting the lead role, instead of placing a leg on every boat.

Rudhramadevi Positives And Negatives: Read In Depth Analysis 4/10 Helpless \nIt is sad that Rudhramadevi was portrayed as a helpless woman most of the times. She lends the support of Gona Ganna Reddy, Chalukya Veerabadhra to face the threats while it is Shiva Devayya who acts as her brain. Warrior Queen?! We did not get to see. Rudhramadevi Positives And Negatives: Read In Depth Analysis 5/10 Allu Arjun \nAllu Arjun's star status and screen presence has helped the film but we doubt if the same star status has killed the warrior in Rudhramadevi. The climax dialogue where he says he has left Mahadeva Nayakudu only because he wants Rudhramadevi to kill him and prove her bravery, appears to have included to satisfy his star image. Rudhramadevi Positives And Negatives: Read In Depth Analysis 6/10 Glamour \nCan we not include sexuality and make a honest film on a warrior queen? Thank god they have edited out the item song of Hamsa Nandini. Rudhramadevi Positives And Negatives: Read In Depth Analysis 7/10 Casting \nWe find many artists out of place though we do not want to name them considering their legendary career or seniority. Rudhramadevi Positives And Negatives: Read In Depth Analysis 8/10 Prakash Raj \nThe actor once again proved what a great talent he is. His dialogues, diction and presence added a boost to the film. Rudhramadevi Positives And Negatives: Read In Depth Analysis 9/10 \nLast but not the least Chiranjeevi's voice over surely fills the spirit.
