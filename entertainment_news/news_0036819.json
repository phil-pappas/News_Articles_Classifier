Wait, don't leave! This information could be worth … $1 million.\nAnd there you have it, everything you need to understand about Internet fantasy sports. It's an obsessive pastime for the generation of sports nuts who live on their smartphones. And it's a rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar business that looks and sounds a lot like sports gambling: You win (or lose) cash based on the performance of individual players you select for a virtual team.\nThe industry is booming, which is why TV is inundated with commercials for FanDuel and DraftKings, the two biggest sites. These companies rake it in because Internet fantasy sports (football, baseball etc.) is not illegal Internet gambling. Under federal law it's classified as a game of skill, not chance, making it an unregulated digital business — no different in most states from, say, eBay or iTunes.\nDo you see any potential problem with an unsupervised industry in which huge jackpots are paid out depending on whether football players catch passes or baseball players strike out? Hmm, fantasy sports leagues didn't exist in 1919, but the Chicago Black Sox did.\nThere are no allegations of players throwing games in connection with Internet fantasy sports, but there is a burgeoning scandal involving FanDuel and DraftKings. The FBI and Justice Department reportedly are investigating, as is a Florida grand jury. Last week, Nevada suspended the sites in that state, declaring that they need gambling licenses. The Illinois Gaming Board says the games are under review; last week state officials told The Associated Press that Internet fantasy sports are probably illegal because games of chance and skill on the Internet are not allowed.\nDeluge of ads makes fantasy sports a grim reality Eric Zorn \"Blitz\" seems like the perfect word to describe last weekend's pitiless onslaught of football-game commercials for daily fantasy sports betting sites.\nAt nearly every break in the action, college or pro, viewers were hit with come-ons for DraftKings and FanDuel, the dominant companies offering the...\n\"Blitz\" seems like the perfect word to describe last weekend's pitiless onslaught of football-game commercials for daily fantasy sports betting sites.\nAt nearly every break in the action, college or pro, viewers were hit with come-ons for DraftKings and FanDuel, the dominant companies offering the...\n(Eric Zorn) The backlash has struck so quickly that it's like something out of Casablanca: Suddenly authorities are shocked, shocked to find Internet fantasy sports is a thing.\nHere's what sparked the sudden controversy: A manager at DraftKings acknowledged prematurely releasing important customer information about player selections for the third week of the NFL season. The same week, the manager won $350,000 playing fantasy football at FanDuel.\nBoth companies said the manager did not use insider information, and they banned their employees from playing fantasy sports anywhere. But you could practically hear the sighs of dismay from customers, as if the air were let out of a thousand deflated footballs (wait, wrong scandal).\nSpecifically, here's what made customers upset: The information prematurely published was the \"player owned percentages\" — meaning, an overview of which NFL players were picked the most by customers that week, and which were overlooked. The premise of fantasy sports is that each contestant creates a lineup for a mythical team that accrues points based on the individual performances on the field. If an insider knew which standout players were overlooked, it would increase the odds of drafting a unique lineup and winning a jackpot.\nSo one company failed to control valuable information, while both overlooked a potential conflict of interest in allowing employees to play for money at each other's sites. It turns out many of the best fantasy sports players also work in the industry. Most everyone else, by the way, is a likely loser. A Sports Business Daily study that looked at fantasy baseball found that 91 percent of profits were won by 1.3 percent of the players.\nHere's another surprising twist : Despite the fact that professional sports lives in fear of betting scandals, the leagues are in bed with DraftKings and FanDuel. The sites are major advertisers and sponsors. Additionally, DraftKings' investors include Fox, which broadcasts football and baseball, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the NHL. Investors in FanDuel include NBC, which has NFL rights among other sports, and the NBA.\nThere's a lot of money at stake for a lot of intertwined parties. To put it in fantasy sports terms, they're all big fish, while the small-time players are minnows. Possibly suckers, too.\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @ Trib_Ed_Board and Facebook .\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Fantasy Sports NFL Opinion Editorials Cleveland Browns New England Patriots", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55f893a9/turbine/ct-daily-fantasy-sports-blize-perspec-0916-20150915", "https://twitter.com/trib_ed_board", "https://www.facebook.com/TribEdBoard", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627f999/turbine/ct-fantasy-sports-internet-gambling-edit-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:22:44.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
