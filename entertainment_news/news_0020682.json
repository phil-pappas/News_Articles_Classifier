Most pumpkin beers don't contain actual pumpkin (or anything that resembles something from the squash family). Instead, a bunch of pumpkin pie spices are thrown into the mix, leaving you with something that resembles pumpkin pie in a glass in its most over-spiced form. It's not a pleasant experience.\n(And don't get me started on those cinnamon-rimmed glasses.)\nAfter you drink a pumpkin ale, your palate is absolutely destroyed, blanketed with spices. No amount of palate-cleansing crackers or water can erase that spice overload.\nPumpkin mania starts earlier and earlier every year. I saw the first pumpkin beers (I'm looking at you, Southern Tier Pumking) on the store shelves in July. Insanity.\nI know the logic behind this. These beers are huge sellers, especially for some smaller breweries with limited seasonal windows to appease the faithful and attract new converts. My whining about it won't do any good, because the pumpkin beers will probably be released even earlier next year. Who wouldn't love a big frosted mug of pumpkin pie spices while enjoying Fourth of July fireworks?\nIn the spirit of fall, here are some of my seasonal favorites. These beers are perfect for the crisper, cooler days:\n1. Stoneyard Pat's Pumpkin Ya Up\nWhen I earlier stated that most pumpkin ales are garbage, I should've known that a beer from Stoneyard would soften my stance a bit. Pat's Pumpkin Ya Up, named after bartender extraordinaire Patrick Beairsto, is a fuller-bodied, maltier take on the traditional fall classic. It features a subdued spice bill and resembles a hearty pumpkin bread in a glass (something that my mom, Donnalee Cleveland, would whip up like a magician). It's currently on draft at the bar in Brockport. Stoneyard makes beer in very limited batches at this point, so if you miss it, make sure to put it on your must-try list for 2016.\nOutside Auburn's Prison City Brewing and Buffalo's Community Beer Works, Stoneyard is producing the best beers in western New York. Nestled along the Erie Canal in the village of Brockport, Stoneyard has quietly been making some truly outstanding beers for the past 18 months.\nHead brewer Jeffrey \"Oz\" Osborne approaches beer with an engineer's attention to detail and a love of the more mundane aspects of the process. In the past few months, I've been blown away by Osborne's barrel-aged Russian Imperial Stout and his insanely juicy India Pale Ales (especially the brawny Juicehead). Osborne is a true hop savant.\nJack's Abby Copper Legend Octoberfest is one of the best Märzen-style lagers available in our region. (Photo: Molly Kinne/AJ's Beer Warehouse)\n2. Jack's Abby Copper Legend/Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest\nPumpkin beers overshadow my favorite fall seasonal (and arguably one of my favorite styles): Oktoberfest lagers. Oktoberfest or Märzens are traditionally brewed in March (before the dawn of refrigeration!) and then allowed to slowly ferment during the warmer summer months. They are then served in September during Berlin's Oktoberfest festival.\nThe ones I tend to like feature that beautiful deep copper color and are rich and hearty, especially in the malt backbone. That's why I love it when American breweries release true-to-style interpretations. Massachusetts-based Jack's Abby Copper Legend is a wonderful American representation of the style. I think it stacks right up to the German classics like Ayinger and Paulaner.\nSierra Nevada, an American craft brewing pioneer, actually traveled to Germany earlier this year to craft a true Oktoberfest collaboration beer with Brauhaus Riegele, based in Augsburg, Germany. The result is probably the truest American-brewed representation of the style to date with a wonderful malt sweetness that perfectly balances the bread-iness. According to SN, it's the first in what will become a yearly series of collaborations in this style. This first one was truly world-class, so it's exciting to think about where they might be headed next.\nThese beers are available at area Wegmans and independent bottle shops.\n3. North Coast Old Rasputin\nCalifornia-based North Coast Brewing is one of those breweries that I often overlook in my need to find the newest, greatest, up-and-coming beer. It's a big oversight, because it makes me forget about the awesome beers that are already in our market, the beers that usually just sit on our shelves with little or no fanfare.\nNorth Coast produces some all-timers for me, including the fantastic La Merle Saison and Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale. Old Rasputin is too often forgotten in the shuffle, and that's a shame. Coming in at 9 percent alcohol, it's a wonderfully chewy and full-bodied imperial stout that is darker than motor oil. It ages gracefully, and it's always available on shelves in our area. It's perfect for cooler fall nights and creates a great drinking experience as it warms. I can't recommend it enough.\n4. Swiftwater Peach Sour and Wet Hop IPA 5.0\nRight off the bat, I'm going to admit my bias. I've been friends with Swiftwater Brewing founder Andy Cook for a few years through our shared experience with the Upstate New York Homebrewers Association. And when Swiftwater opened on Mt. Hope Avenue earlier this year, Cook invited me to work there a few nights a week. I've made some absolutely incredible friends there.\nCook and his co-brewer, Pat Meehan, are doing some truly wonderful and unique stuff in the South Wedge. They aren't afraid to experiment. Out of the 60-plus batches they've brewed so far, fewer than 10 have been repeats. My favorite Swiftwater beer remains the May, a wonderfully robust Schwarzbier (or dark German lager). Right now, I'm particularly enamored with two beers: the Peach Sour and Wet Hop IPA 5.0.\nThe Peach Sour is the best kettle sour that Swiftwater has released. It's brewed with saison yeast and Brettanomyces claussenii (or Brett C). Brett is a wild yeast that can behave in unexpected ways. But Meehan and Cook aren't afraid to take chances. It's admirable. And then the beer was conditioned on 250 pounds of locally grown peaches. The resulting beer is turbid in appearance and features a tart peachiness. If it were available during the summer, I easily would've consumed gallons of it.\nOn the other end of spectrum is Swiftwater's new wet hop India Pale Ale, which features pounds and pounds of freshly picked hops from Pumpkin Hill Hopyard in Cayuga County. Wet hop IPAs are a great fall staple for that green and grassy taste. Both are on tap now at Swiftwater and are much better alternatives than the pumpkin spice brews that we're currently being bombarded with.\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Rochester/Rochester/635797676753771260-IMG-7409.JPG", "http://www.sierranevada.com/oktoberfest", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/06/Rochester/Rochester/635797676753771260-IMG-7409.JPG", "http://www.prisoncitybrewing.com/", "http://www.communitybeerworks.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f2d4ceca58a6a0c73acc03cf81ff9b74a2332db/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Rochester/Rochester/635797676753771260-IMG-7409.JPG", "http://swiftwaterbrewing.com/", "http://stoneyardbrewingcompany.com/beers-on-tap/", "http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/", "http://brewpublic.com/beer-news/sierra-nevada-partners-with-brauhaus-riegele-on-new-oktoberfest-beer/", "http://jacksabby.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:20:12.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
