Adrian our audio guy got told he looks like @Sethrogen on the weekend!” \nThe hosts probably weren’t expecting the Knocked Up star to see the tweet, let alone respond to it, but that's exactly what happened. \n“ @StavAndAbby that hurts my feelings!” wrote Rogen who has 3.31 million Twitter followers. \nThe HIT 105 team tried to capitalise on the reply and asked the 33-year-old actor if he’d like to “come on our show and talk about it in the next five minutes”. \nBut Rogen clearly wasn’t in a playful mood. \n“@StavAndAbby why the fu*k would I do that after you insulted me?” he wrote. \nSpeaking to news.com.au, Abby Coleman said they didn’t mean to offend Rogen. \n“I think it’s a compliment — I think Seth Rogen’s cute,” she said. \nBut Stav was less ... complimentary. \n“I didn’t realise Seth Rogen was so sensitive?” he said. \n“At least no one says they look like him in The Green Hornet … cos no one saw that piece of sh*t”. \nOh, and in case you’re wondering, here’s what Adrian the audio guy actually looks like: That’s the real Seth Rogen on the left and lookalike Adrian on the right.
