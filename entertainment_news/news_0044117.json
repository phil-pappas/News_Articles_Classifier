Jakub Hrusa, former music director of the Prague Philharmonia, is guest conductor.\nAlso on the program is Antonin Dvorak’s symphonic poem “A Hero’s Song,” and Benjamin Britten’s Violin Concerto No. 1.\nCONCERT PREVIEW Seattle Symphony: ‘Also Sprach Zarathustra’ 7:30 p.m. Thursday and 8 p.m. Saturday (Oct. 8 and 10) at Benaroya Hall, 200 University St., Seattle; tickets from $21 (206-215-4747 or seattlesymphony.org ). Masterworks programs are free to youth 8-18; two youth passes are available for every regularly priced ticket purchased.\n“Sunrise” is heard a couple of other times in Kubrick’s 1968 masterpiece. As with the mysterious, perpendicular “monolith” that shows up at crucial moments in the film — a visual echo of the giant rock that inspired German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to write his 19th-century novel “Also Sprach Zarathustra” (“Thus Spoke Zarathustra”) — the musical refrain alludes to Nietzsche’s ideas about the acceptance of fate, the endless cycle of construction and destruction, and the rise of the “superman” to withstand its effects.\n  Actually, “2001” does more than allude: Kubrick sidesteps Nietzsche to speak to the larger question of our place in the universe. So does Strauss in the extravagant, effects-laden, metaphysical design of his composition.\nFor Strauss, the question of reconciling human and cosmic destinies was unresolved, and that’s exactly how his “Zarathustra” ends: with an inconclusive, enigmatic and deeply stirring juxtaposition of two keys, C (played by basses) and B (woodwinds).\n“The piece,” says Hrusa in an email, “has many stretches of contemplation and an ending as open as a philosophical question, one of the most unresolved endings in musical literature (and definitely one of the most difficult to musically realize). The composition is also unique in its general shape, starting with an overwhelming opening which really shakes you terribly, and traveling through all imaginable realms of musical landscape (meditation, struggle, great impressive gestures, dance) into one crushing question mark. It’s a journey one can musically experience.”\nHow does “Zarathustra” stack up against another Strauss tone poem, “Don Quixote,” which SSO is performing this week?\n“ ‘Don Quixote’ is more literally programmatic,” Hrusa says. “It depends on what type of listener you are: some people are totally happy following music abstractly. What I know for sure is you don’t miss anything if you listen to ‘Zarathustra’ without knowing what it is ‘about.’ Listen to it as pure music.”\nGuest violinist on Britten’s Violin Concerto will be Norway’s Vilde Frang, who made her debut three years ago with the Vienna Philharmonic.\nHrusa calls Frang “simply wonderful. I have loads of admiration for her. Apart from her talent, I love her humility.”\nBorn in the Czech Republic, Hrusa studied piano and wind instruments, deciding at age 15 to make conducting his vocation. He became music director of the Prague Philharmonia in 2008, and left this year to take the reins of the Bavarian State Philharmonic. He is also principal guest conductor of the Czech Philharmonic and Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.\nAbout “A Hero’s Song,” Hrusa says it is “Dvorak’s last instrumental piece, which he wrote shortly before his unexpected death. It’s a proud vision of himself at that point in his life: the artist who is the hero. He describes what led him to his artistic victories, through all possible struggles, sadness, searching for consolation, winning battles. This is what connects it to Strauss’ ‘Zarathustra’ so wonderfully — that incredible musical journey we witness. The audience needs only an open heart.”\nTom Keogh: tomwkeogh@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:15:32.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
