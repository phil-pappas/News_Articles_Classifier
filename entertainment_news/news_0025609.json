Following on from our recently launched podcasts, we've got some big plans in the pipeline which we don't want to spill the beans on just yet but let's just say that there'll be more in it for you than ever before (and it won't cost you nothing either).\nTo kick things off, check out this competition right here which includes a limited edition Mad Max: Fury Road set, tickets, movies & more , and stay tuned for more to come.\nWhatever we do, know that we plan on digging up that TV, film, music and entertainment gold for you as we stride into adulthood with all the excitement of a student heading off to college for the first time.\nFor now however, let's take a look back to 1997 and see what was going down when we were still trying to understand why we couldn't use the internet AND call someone at the same time. Thank jaysis that's behind us.\nHow well do you remember 1997? Test your knowledge with this movie quiz to see how well you know the year of our birth.\nMORE: Happy Birthday has officially lost its copyright, expect to hear it a lot more\nMORE: Instagram is turning five next week, here's everything you didn't know about it\nMORE: Wanna come work for the best damn entertainment and beauty websites?
