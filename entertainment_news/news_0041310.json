Now I’m glad mine’s dead.”\nThe weepy giggling in the room was cut with a palpable gasp, as if a few hundred people had all been simultaneously kicked in the sternum while being tickled.\nFor Davidson, 21, that was an optimal result. On a recent night in his Brooklyn Heights apartment, in the middle of playing NBA 2K15 on his Xbox One with his friend Anthony and placing several orders from a local diner on Seamless, he talked about making people squirm just a bit.\nMost Read Stories Our state’s greatest gift to the nation just got canceled Clay Matthews tells Colin Kaepernick: ‘You ain’t Russell Wilson, bro’ Watch: Former Mariners great Ichiro Suzuki pitches — yes, pitches — for the Marlins Gun violence: Don’t fear gun laws; let gun-owners help pay to fix the problem Two high school football players hospitalized after serious game injuries Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “I’m like, ‘Heyyyy, I just want to talk about this, that everybody’s uncomfortable about.’ I like doing that. I like making things that are dark, awkward, weird things that you don’t really find funny, funny.”\nIn just a few years, Davidson has made this sort of shoulder-shrugging, post-trauma, post-trigger-warning comedy his calling card. His rise from cramped New York comedy clubs to TV and film has been rapid. On Saturday (Oct. 3), he began his second season as a featured player on “Saturday Night Live,” where he stood out last season for his deceptively plain-spoken, wide-eyed takes on young male immaturity.\nDavidson is 6-foot-3 and built like an ivy vine, slender and bendy. “You see him and you think, ‘This poor kid — I wanna buy him a sandwich,’ ” Dave Attell, one of his mentors, said. But while Davidson projects a slow-tempo innocence, it’s married to a profound, sad wisdom.\nIt is an approach unlike that of anyone else on the current “SNL” roster — there is something of Adam Sandler’s aw-shucks naiveté to him, and “SNL” founder Lorne Michaels likens his openness and warmth to Jimmy Fallon’s.\nHow Davidson uses those tools, though, is wholly his own. He made his mark on the first episode of last season, during a Weekend Update segment in which, billed as the “Resident Young Person,” he did a bit derived from his stand-up routine about how much money it would take for him to perform certain sexual acts on another man (with, for good measure, a quick detour about his mother’s sexual practices).\n“The sexual politics of it were not highly evolved,” Michaels said. “People would have judged the same material from someone else much more harshly.”\nBut Davidson has a way of nuzzling up to a difficult joke, unblinking but innocently. His stories move at a stroll. “He lives in the pauses,” Attell said.\nDavidson achieves a lot with small facial gestures: In one stand-up routine, the punch line to a joke about his sexual habits is just him widening his eyes. He is disarming, a teddy bear who’s seen too much.\nDavidson’s father, Scott, a firefighter with Ladder 118 in Brooklyn, was last seen at the Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed when the twin towers collapsed. Davidson has 8418, his father’s badge number, tattooed on his left arm. In his apartment is a replica of his father’s firefighter helmet.\n“It was sad how sad he was growing up,” Davidson’s mother, Amy, said. In school, he would act out. At one point, he said, he ripped all his hair out until he was bald. He became a “lab rat” for doctors studying the children of Sept. 11 victims.\nHe attended three high schools, convinced that the kids at each were mean, but “then I was like, ‘Oh! It’s me!’ ” he said. “Here’s how corny I was — my dad died in 9/11 and people still” were mean.\nDavidson began doing stand-up at 16; his mother would drive him to gigs in Manhattan from Staten Island. “He had a tough time growing up without a dad — I wanted him to be happy, and this made him really, really happy,” she said.\nIn comedy clubs, with their gaggles of oddballs and cranks, he found friends. “I just blended in perfectly,” he said. “I feel very safe — you can say whatever you want.\n“I loved the power and the freedom — you gotta listen to what I have to say,” he added. “It was the first time I felt that way.”\nJON CARAMANICA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:16:49.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
