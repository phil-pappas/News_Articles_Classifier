As you can imagine, him being the love of my life, regardless of us going through a separation or not it was extremely hurtful.'' \nAmber says the 'See You Again' hitmaker, 28, has already apologised to her for the mean lyrics, adding: ''Wiz actually apologised to me already, so I have forgiven him.'' \nThe stunning model is also eager to forgive ex-boyfriend Kanye, 38, who previously claimed he had to take ''30 showers'' before dating current wife Kim Kardashian West to get Amber out of his system. \nShe said: ''I want to forgive Kanye about what he said about me. I want to let all of that negativity go.'' \nMeanwhile, Amber's mother Dorothy Rose appeared to take her own swing at Kanye by holding up a sign that read 'F**k yo 30 showers'.
