She posted the footage on Instagram . \n\"My friend filmed my reaction. Totally emotional seeing it for the first time and so so so incredibly awed to be part of this incredible legacy #starwars #theforceawakens,\" she wrote as the caption. \nA video posted by @daisyridley on Oct 19, 2015 at 8:06pm PDT \nRidley, a British actress who has only been professionally acting since 2013, portrays Rey. Reportedly, her character is a scavenger who trades her finds on the world of Jakku. In the trailer, it seems that the voice talking to her, asking her who she is, is Gwendoline Christie's Captain Phasma. As of right now, she has no last name and that could be curious moving forward. \nJohn Boyega also posted an amazing video of his reaction to the trailer. \n\"THE TRAILER IS JUST EEEE ! Star Wars is back! g d l rd! You know what! Let me just relax because this kind God oooo! Lmao! Seriously congrats to everyone ! December 18th!\" he wrote with his accompanying video on Instagram . \nA video posted by @john_boyega on Oct 20, 2015 at 12:02am PDT \nHis character Finn is just as intriguing. In the latest trailer, Boyega's Finn is heard saying, \"I was raised to do one thing,\" as he pulls off his Stormtrooper helmet. \"But I've got nothing to fight for.\" \nWe've seen him in Stormtrooper gear, so is he a turncoat siding with the Rebellion? We also see him pat backs with Oscar Isaac's resistance pilot, Poe Dameron. \nProducers are keeping details close to the vest, so we'll just have to wait patiently until the movie hits theaters December 18. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
