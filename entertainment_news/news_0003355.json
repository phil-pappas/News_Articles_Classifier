Tines / The Detroit News) \nRestaurants are ensemble performances. The chef may get much of the credit, but it is really the staff from top to bottom that makes or breaks it. \nThat is abundantly clear at Selden Standard, the top-rated restaurant that will celebrate its first anniversary on Nov. 2. The staff works seamlessly with co-proprietors Evan Hansen and Executive Chef Andy Hollyday to offer an optimum dining experience. \nAnd so the anniversary will be marked by closing to the public for the day so that the staff has a chance to celebrate together in the setting that has become a midtown destination in record time. \nSince Selden Standard is open seven days a week, serving lunch, brunch and dinner, the crew certainly deserves a break. \nMy most recent visit was at brunch on a Sunday. The place was comfortably full, with people at the bar, at tables, at the handful of seats at the counter in front of the wood-burning oven. Diners also could be found on the patio in the rear with its strings of open-filament bulbs giving the place a festive look even during the day. \nIf the word brunch evokes thoughts of lavish spreads on groaning buffet tables, think again. That’s not Selden Standard style. Brunch here is a la carte, ordered from the menu, a simple one-page list of dishes with each one a specialty, from the two salads, arugula and pear with lemon vinaigrette and roasted beets with housemade ricotta, to the pastrami hash with poached egg. \nI had better stop using the word “house-made,” since at this establishment just about everything, including the butter for the scones, is made inhouse. \nAt my table, we ordered two of the main plates, the tortilla Espanola, a traditional Spanish egg and potato omelet, in this case with romesco sauce (minus the usual tomatoes but with the addition of almonds), and lemon ricotta pancakes with maple syrup and a scattering of fresh fruit, both lovely. Also on the day’s menu, shrimp and grits, chilaquiles with tomatillos, black beans and fried eggs, and mushroom toasts paired with a swirl of fresh greens. \nThe commitment to fresh and seasonal in both kitchen and bar was illustrated when I asked for a virgin Bloody Mary. The bartender explained that it wouldn’t look like the classic drink, since tomatoes are out of season in Michigan and they squeeze their own tomatoes for the juice, so it would be made with sherry vinegar and aromatic herbs, not exactly a classic Bloody Mary but a lot of the same basic flavors. \nThey don’t make them inhouse yet, but Hansen says, “We’re tinkering with pickles now.” \nThe current lunch menu parallels the brunch selection, with just a few carefully chosen dishes from a daily changing soup and a pair of sandwiches, roasted vegetables — seasonal, of course — and smoked pastrami, to flatbreads from the wood-burning oven. The menu expands greatly at dinner, with an array of grilled meats, including lamb and pork, and whole grilled trout. \nThe approach is as contemporary as the room itself with its white subway tile, cement floors and cedar-topped bar. \nThe proprietors like to call Selden Standard a neighborhood restaurant. There are a lot of neighborhoods that would love to have its style and substance in theirs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:18:52.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
