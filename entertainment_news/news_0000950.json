Multiple sources told the website that the \" Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" star was convinced that he would change. According to some sources, Lamar told Khloe, \"I am done with drugs.\" The 35-year-old athlete also thanked his estranged wife for coming to Las Vegas and taking care of him throughout the ordeal. He reportedly told her many times that he loved her. As previously reported, Khloe's lawyer Laura Wasser went to a court on Wednesday morning, October 21 and asked a judge to withdraw the papers Khloe and Lamar signed to end their marriage. The request was granted by a Los Angeles judge. While the pair haven't spoken to the press about the dismissal of their divorce, the news outlet reported that not everyone in the Jenner-Kardashian family thought Khloe's decision was good because Lamar had broken such promise before. On the other hand, Khloe's relationship and James Harden remains unclear following the dismissal of the divorce papers. Fans quickly reacted to the news about Khloe and Lamar calling off their divorce. Memes of Lamar and James separately went viral on social media like Instagram and Twitter. In a meme with a picture of Lamar smiling, the words read, \"When you fake die to get yo b***h back.\" Meanwhile, a meme with a picture of James looking fazed came with the words, \"When ya girl ex fake die to get her back.\" Foto kiriman El Monito Cabron (@el_monito_cabron) pada Okt 21, 2015 pada 2:29 PDT Foto kiriman IVE BEEN KNOWN TO GET SILLY (@savvy_the_amusing) pada Okt 21, 2015 pada 2:17 PDT \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:49.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
