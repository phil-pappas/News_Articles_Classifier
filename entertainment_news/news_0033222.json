My mom is employed by the government as a school teacher, my dad is employed by the government as a General Foreman at a school. And I have two younger siblings. I admit my family is more privileged than many other South African families, but a helping hand would have been appreciated.\nAs my matric results were not good enough for a bursary, I had to make another plan. My next option was applying for a student loan. After the second year my mom decided to save each year to pay for my studies. When my brother matriculated and made plans to study further I decided to study part time and to work full time to try and lessen the financial burden for my family.\nFast forward to 2015, I have finally made it to my third year. I'm competing my B.com degree in Finance and Information Systems and I have two subjects left to compete my degree. I just found out earlier this week that I don't qualify to write one of my exams and I am still waiting on results to find out if I qualify to write my other exam. I have a job that pays me well, but I have recently had to buy my first car so that I could actually get to work. On the one hand I'm excited because I've reached one of my goals, but I'm also half dreading my first instalment going off because I still have two years worth of student debt that I'm struggling to pay off. As well as my fees for this year.\nAt first I was irritated with these students protesting about fee increases. But then I realised that they are protesting so that no other South African should have to drown in student debt like I am, all because they want a better life for themselves and their families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:16:24.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
