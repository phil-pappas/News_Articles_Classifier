Are you under pressure because of the expectations? \nI never feel the pressure. It is a new film for me. \nYour earlier films were masala entertainers while Singh Is Bliing is a comedy film. \nAs a director you have to do all kinds of films. My other films also have a touch of comedy but this film is 80 per cent comedy. \nDo you share a good rapport with Akshay Kumar? \nWhile we were shooting Singh Is Bliing, Akshay made some mistake and he accepted it. He said one should bow oneâ€™s head to do better. During the shooting of a song, Akshay got burnt but he insisted on doing the shot again. He wanted to overcome his fear. \nPrabhudeva Do you also relate to Akshay Kumar the person? \nOnce he showed me a message that he had got from someone which said that a certain person needed a job. He felt that person should be given a job and we did, he is a part of the film. \nWhat do you think went wrong with your previous film Action Jackson? Were you disappointed? \nI think I went wrong with Action Jackson. There is always a second chance. Yes of course, I was disappointed. I am a normal human being. \nHave you ever been scared or nervous about dancing with anyone? \nIt was while dancing for ABCD and ABCD 2 because the dancers in those two films are too dangerous. They are dancers of international standards. So dancing with them was tough. \nHas dance changed in Bollywood? \nI think we do have good dancers now like Hrithik Roshan, Shahid Kapoor, Tiger Shroff. I am a choreographer for 28 years or so. It is part of my job to make actors dance. \nIs it true that you were going to work with Amitabh Bachchan? \nThere was an opportunity to work with him but things did not happen because of date issues. I hope to work with him. Whenever he calls, I will be ready.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:17:25.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
