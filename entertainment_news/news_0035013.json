Samantha Womack as Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders (BBC) \nLittle wonder fans lost it when the sound cut out during their talk. Could there be a more tense moment for an embarrassing tech-fail? \nTwitter was soon awash with EastEnders viewers venting. Some demanded a TV licence refund No mention of the sound loss during #EastEnders ? I want my TV licence money back. \n— Louise Jones (@louisejonesetc) October 22, 2015 Others wondered if they were at fault Did anyone notice the sound go in EastEnders? \n— Janette Irvine (@jannyp70) October 22, 2015 I thought I leaned on the remote but nope! No sound @BBCOne #Eastenders \n— Kelly (@kells_kells) October 22, 2015 Much annoyance at the timing of the fail What the bloody hell happened to the sound on #EastEnders tonight. Need to go to iplayer to see what Ronnie was threatening to do with Dean \n— Phi Thuggah (@PhiPhi__x) October 22, 2015 WTF. The one time I watch #Eastenders the sound decides to disappear. What did Ronnie say to Linda? I wanna know. #suspenseorwhat \n— AdenosineDiphosphate (@KeemaKiiWii) October 22, 2015 Fans went big on the apology angle How has @BBCOne not apologised for the sound muting on Eastenders. I have no clue what Ronnie planning on Dean! \n— Laura S (@LsFfc) October 22, 2015 No apology either from the sound issues! #EastEnders @bbceastenders \n— Katie Joy (@UYJewellery) October 22, 2015 Sound gone on eastenders,we hoping to get an apology for that \n— Beatrice Pinkie (@MissBeapinky) October 22, 2015 A few were content to gloat #EastEnders apparently some viewers lost the sound at the end of the episode.Happy to say it was fine here. Best ending for a while, as well \n— Old Man About Town (@OldManAboutTown) October 22, 2015 But some saw the funny side The sound's gone on #EastEnders , there is a God.. \n— Warren Kearney (@KearneyWarren) October 22, 2015 Share article \nEastEnders producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has teased an explosive Christmas in Albert Square so let’s hope there are no further sound issues.
