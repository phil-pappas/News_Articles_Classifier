This will make them the third official sponsor of IPL in less than nine seasons. The IPL is the most-watched domestic Twenty20 competition in the world. However, it has been ridden with controversies. Several players and top officials have been implicated of match-fixing and spot-fixing. One of the officials told Economic Times, “Pepsi had raised concerns about ethics in the IPL tournament and had been in discussions with BCCI on how these concerns can be addressed. The company is very clear that it doesn’t want to be associated with a controversy ridden sport.” But beyond, all the bad work, the tournament has been a boon for several young cricketers. It has brought in revenue, given domestic players a chance to rub shoulders with the best players across the world and given India many promising talent. The coming up of IPL has changed the landscape of world cricket. One of the officials involved with the development of Vivo told Economic Times, “Vivo is a mobile phone maker wants to establish its presence in India and the IPL will give it the platform it needs for visibility.” \n  1:56 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:13:30.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
