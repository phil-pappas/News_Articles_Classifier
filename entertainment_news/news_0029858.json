When he finally resettled in Louisville, burnt out and leaning way too hard on various substances, he decided it was time to turn down the volume. On everything. \n\"My school life, my home life, were basically in a shambles because of what I had been doing,\" said Wilde, 29. \"I was drinking a lot at the time, and some other stuff. I had just kind of reached the bottom. I started getting real dark and depressed as a result of the mess I'd made of my personal life.\" \nDon't worry. This is ultimately a happy story. Wilde's downward slide resulted in a 2010 solo album that is by no means happy, but it also led to the almost accidental birth of Quiet Hollers. He put the band together for an album-release show and there was a clear connection and chemistry. \nThis week the band celebrates the release of its second album, \"Quiet Hollers,\" and it's both a departure and a leap forward. Quiet Hollers' 2013 album, \"I Am the Morning,\" squarely placed the band — which also includes Nick Goldring, Ryan Scott, Aaron West and Jim Bob Brown — in the Americana genre. That's a broad tag that can mean a lot of things. Quiet Hollers premieres 'Cote d'Azur' video \nThe new album is bolder, more dynamic and textured, but still informed by Wilde's penchant for considered — and frequently harsh — self-examination. If a label had to be applied, Americana would still fit, but in many ways the songs on \"Quiet Hollers\" are more akin to what Bruce Springsteen was doing around the time of \"The River\" — confessional rock 'n' roll that taps into larger societal issues. \n\"The shift away from straight-up Americana, or alt-country, was both conscious and natural, in the sense that I wasn't censoring my songwriting to fit into a particular genre, but I also wasn't setting out to write any kind of specific song,\" Wilde said. \"What was more important to me was that I was creating the best songs and the best music that I have, so far, in my life.\" \nWilde was born in Boston, then moved to San Francisco, Holland, the Netherlands, Cuba and finally, as a teenager, Louisville. He had grown up obsessively listening to and playing music and, by age 10, was reasonably mediocre on piano and guitar. \n\"I had always been fascinated with musicians that I would see on TV or hear in house when growing up. My mother was definitely into music,\" Wilde said.\"Allegedly there's a video floating around somewhere of me doing a very spirited rendition of Tiny Tim.\" \nIn Louisville, a 17-year-old Wilde started an Oi! punk band, Straight Laced, which released a couple of albums. While touring with Straight Laced he met Iron Cross, one of the country's top Oi! bands, and was eventually asked to join. He also hooked up with Lexington's Brassknuckle Boys and five years disappeared in a haze as Wilde toured with both bands, a period he evocatively captures on \"Road Song,\" from \"I Am the Morning.\" \nThe cover of the new Quiet Hollers album \"Quiet Hollers.\" (Photo: Provided) \nHe isn't done with the road, however, just the haze. Now married with a 6-month-old, Wilde said both he and the band have a strong support system in place, a luxury that allows them to see how far they can take Quiet Hollers. \n\"My plan right now is to do Quiet Hollers as hard as I can for as long as I can, sensibly,\" Wilde said. \"This is all real new to us, being a part of something that seems like it has the steam to push forward. Everyone's on board and we're all ready ... to rise to the occasion and see what happens.\" \nReporter Jeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160 and jpuckett@courier-journal.com. 68 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Ls3EeO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:23:35.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
