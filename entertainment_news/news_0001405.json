Photo: broachphoto \nThree months ago, US President Barack Obama visited stand-up comic Marc Maron in his Los Angeles garage. It was not a surprise. He was there to talk with Maron on his much-beloved podcast WTF With Marc Maron .\nBut Maron was still a nervous wreck.\n\"It was mind-blowing, really,\" he says. \"My main fear was that I wouldn't be able to connect with him. Politicians are very good at servicing their agendas and moving through talking points and my fear was I would get mired in his rhetoric in some way.\"\nHours before the unprecedented POTUS podcast, Maron had sat in his living room eating cereal and playing an unplugged Gibson 335 to \"find his own space\". \nAdvertisement Secret Service agents combed the house for potential security issues and a sniper was positioned on the roof of the house next door,  much to the delight of its owner. Maron's pocketknife and a broken hammer, both part of the clutter on his garage desk, were removed. His cats were shut in a bedroom.\nThe comic was astonished that Obama wanted to visit – \"That's insane!\" he recalled thinking when it was confirmed. \"The President is just going to come over to my house? My two-bedroom, one-bathroom house and sit in my broken-down garage?\"\n   \nA photo posted by @marcmaron on Jun 19, 2015 at 1:40pm PDT \n \nAnd then he was there, sleeves rolled up and holding coffee in a takeaway cup imprinted with the presidential shield.\n\"He came into the garage, he looked around, he connected with the environment,\" he says.\n\"He made fun of me a little bit, put me at ease and we talked about some fairly big topics.\"\nHe and Maron discussed race relations, terrorism, fatherhood, fitting in, stress and the Charleston church shooting and gun laws (\"It's not enough to just feel bad,\" the President said. \"There are actions that could be taken to make events like this less likely.\"). \nThen Obama left, leaving Maron to have a little post-podcast cry and, in the interests of posterity, cover the president's cup in a glass salad bowl.\n  Too much? \nA photo posted by @marcmaron on Jul 6, 2015 at 6:26pm PDT \n \nIt is safe to say that such a meeting would not have happened a decade ago. \nOver the years Maron has struggled with alcohol, drugs, divorce (twice), recovery, success and fame. He has been sober since 1999 but, six years ago, Maron's stand-up career was in a slump.\nHe had been fired from American radio network Air America and his live shows were not attracting an audience.  Peers such as Louis C.K. and Sarah Silverman​ were finding the fame he wished for. \nHe first tried being funny live at a LA comedy club in 1987 aged 24 and it became a career in the mid-1990s when he moved to New York.\nHe toured, released CDs, hosted radio and TV shows and became a regular on Conan (at last count, 46 times). But a level of rage and fear fuelled his comedy, and wider success eluded him. \nThen he started WTF and many things fell into place. The aggressive and tortured Maron gave way to a more enlightened and engaged person. He is still curmudgeonly and self-lacerating, but his willingness to expose his failings, and a desire to dig deep in conversation with WTF  guests, spurred the podcast's success.\nA new kind of vulnerability and honesty has pushed his stand-up to new highs.\n\"I have a very compulsive and immediate need to connect with people,\" he says.\n\"Early on as a comic I don't think that was my goal. I felt that I was on stage at odds with an audience immediately.\n\"As the podcast has gone on, and I could connect with peers and celebrities and the President now, whatever has happened over the arc of the podcast, I've felt more comfortable with myself and people and with listening and connecting.\n\"After a certain point of doing some angrier, political satire, I began to seek out what I was angry about and where it came from,\" he says. \n\"And in the last few years I've been doing some of the best comedy of my life. Sort of coming to grips with my own struggles, whether they be in the real world or in my mind. I don't know that we always can tell the difference.\"\nAs a podcaster, Maron, who is touring Australia in October, has had many guests in his rundown, cactus and succulent-surrounded garage for  WTF, now   one of the most critically acclaimed podcasts, with between 7 and 8 million downloads a month.\nIn more than 640 episodes (it began in 2009), Maron's free-ranging chats have featured everyone from Amy Schumer to Mel Brooks, Anthony Bourdain, Lena Dunham, Iggy Pop and Sir Ian McKellen​.\nHis two-part interview with Louis C.K ., in which the comedian broke down while recalling the birth of his daughter, was rated the No.1  podcast episode of all time by Slate  magazine and dramatised by C.K. on his sitcom Louie .\nOne of Maron's most memorable conversations, he says, was with the late Robin Williams in 2010, when he talked candidly about divorce, drug use, sobriety and depression. \n \" That conversation is what defined this show from that point on and what defined my life in a lot of ways,\" Maron says in a new intro recorded for the episode.\n\"It seemed to be that he was ready to talk for almost the first time in his life in a way that he'd never talked publicly before. And I was happy to be there for it.\n\"It changed my life. And it changed many people's perceptions of Robin Williams.\" \n \n   \n \n \nHe bemoans how advances in technology have changed how people communicate.\n\"Most people would rather text than talk on the phone. The technology that we thought would make our lives more convenient has made it more convenient for us to do more things. I believe that two people talking for an hour, being connected, is some weird lost pastime.\n\"And sadly, it is a very nourishing thing to do to have a conversation with a peer about stuff.\n\"I find that people have come to see that as hampering or some sort of burden. Like, 'I don't have time', or 'I understand you have problems but it's not really my problem'.\n\"But what that kind of conversation yields is something truly amazing, an ebb and flow of emotion and moving through someone's stories in normal time.\n\"That's always been an exciting thing for me.\" \nHe still freaks out before a WTF  interview. \n\"I'm never entering completely confident and I think I may mistake that for not having a system to doing things. I think that may be my way of doing things. Fuelled by panic until I feel comfortable.\n\"You spend a lot of time, if you're a certain kind of person, feeling uncomfortable or different, like you're nervous in your skin, and I spend a lot of time in my head.\n\"So I think the getting outside myself, and also relating to other people over time has made me a little more comfortable in the world.\n\"It's made me, I guess, a better person.\"\nBREAKOUT: MARON ON ... Childhood  \"My parents were very self-involved and I was left to my own devices to build a set of ideals and principles and behaviours to get me through life. And I don't know that they were all that great. So, with  WTF , I was probably seeking some sort of connection and approval and guidance, things you might seek from a parent at a different time. \nAustralia  \"On one Sydney visit, writer Luke Davies, [author of the novel  Candy ],really saved my ass. I'd just separated from my wife, I was not in a good place and I got off the plane and I dropped my computer and my computer broke. He set me up with a Macintosh guy and took me out to Bondi beach. He took care of me. It was as good a time that could be had for a recently broken-up guy with a broken computer in another country.\"\nStand-up  \"I can confidently say I'm doing the best comedy of my life. I don't have the fears that I used to. I'm glad I've grown. I've definitely not gone soft but I'm not full of panic any more. I'm happy with who I am, even though that's a little crazy.\"\nMarc Maron performs at the State Theatre, Sydney, on October 15, and the Palais Theatre, Melbourne, on October 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:46:59.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
