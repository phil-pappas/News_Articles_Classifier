They sawed it in three pieces. \nBarrymore, star of \"Grand Hotel\" and grandfather of actress Drew Barrymore, displayed the pole in the garden of his California estate. \nAfter Barrymore's death, actor Vincent Price, known for horror flicks such as \"House of Wax,\" and his wife bought the item and also used it as a yard decoration. The couple donated it to the Honolulu Museum of Art in 1981. \nMuseum officials returned the cedar pole to seven Tlingit tribal members who traveled to Honolulu from the southeast Alaska village of Klawock for an intimate ceremony Thursday. \nThe tribal members wore leis as they sang songs and handed out gifts, thanking Hawaii for taking good care of the totem pole. The object was packed in a crate to be shipped to Alaska. \nLangdon learned the pole was used for burials, and he said there were remains of a man inside before Barrymore had it erected at his home. Langdon does not know what happened to the remains after they were removed from the pole. \nIt was among more than 100 totem poles that once stood in the old village of Tuxecan on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, which was inhabited by the Tlingit people, the museum said in a news release. \nOf the original Tuxecan poles, only two remain, both in Klawock, the village of 800 people where the tribe moved, according to the museum. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show Klawock has a population of 800, not 80.
