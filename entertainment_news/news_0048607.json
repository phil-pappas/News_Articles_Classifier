The EMMA recognizes the cable industry’s commitment to implementing best practices, while developing creative, strategic and innovative approaches to ethnic-targeted marketing.

Francia, GMA First Vice President and Head of Operations, GMA International; and Grace Labaguis, Marketing Consultant, East Coast USA \nThe awarding was held during Cable Diversity Week at the Marriott Marquis on Times Square, New York City on Sep. 30. \nWinning first place in the Print Category was the More to Love Print Ad for Telus featuring some of the Network’s brightest stars and most-wanted programs offered in the free preview of all three GMA international channels on Canadian pay television carrier Telus. With print being one of the most effective avenues for promotion and branding, the Telus ad was a significant factor in the increase of subscribers for GMA’s three international channels in Canada. \nIn the All Other Media category, the Alex Esclamado Memorial Award placed second, while Home Away From Home “Battad” episode landed third place. \nThe Alex Esclamado Memorial Award for Community Service was conceived by GMA International in partnership with the National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA) to strengthen its bond with the Filipino community and to increase understanding by the American mainstream of its multi-cultural identity. \nNamed after the late Alex Esclamado, a champion of Filipino-American empowerment, newspaper publisher-editor, and founding chairman of NaFFAA, the largest coalition of Filipino organizations in the U.S, the awards serve to honor exemplary services by Filipino-American organizations in various fields. NaFFAA has asked GMA to make the Awards a regular highlight of its biennial national conference. \nThe award-winning program Home Away From Home on GMA’s flagship international channel GMA Pinoy TV, showcases the lives of different Filipinos overseas who have been an important part in their respective communities and have excelled in their fields. \nThe winning episode focused on the Philippine American Association of Connecticut (P.A.A.C.), one of the oldest community-based cultural organizations in America, and its President Joseph Battad. The feature depicted the challenges faced by Filipinos abroad and showed how members of P.A.A.C. feel the warmth of home through their fellow Filipinos. \nMeanwhile, the Ilustrado World Premiere Tweet Up Promo, which utilized social media in the promotion of GMA’s first historical drama Ilustrado, landed third place in the Social Media Category. \nOnline viewing parties via the hashtag #Ilustrado on various social media platforms were used to gather program insights and photos of global Filipinos as they watched the pilot episode of Ilustrado. \nThe proudly Philippine-made GMA Pinoy TV Loudbasstard Bamboo Speaker, received second place in the Premium category. \nFusing tradition and innovation, the premium item, produced in collaboration with Loudbasstard, employs native Philippine elements through its distinct bamboo design. As a special item for GMA Pinoy TV’s 10th anniversary, the bamboo speakers, which were produced in three colors, were engraved with GMA’s three channel logos – GMA Pinoy TV, GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International. \n“These recognitions from a prestigious award-giving body are an affirmation of the quality service we extend to our fellow Filipinos, made more meaningful as we celebrate GMA Pinoy TV’s 10th anniversary this year. These awards strengthen our commitment to be of even better service to our fellow Filipinos living abroad,” expressed GMA First Vice President and Head of International Operations Joseph T. Francia, who also served as a panelist for the “Global Content Comes to Town” session at the 29th Annual NAMIC Conference held on Sept. 29. \nThe panel discussion focused on global content creation and the challenges faced by content creators in marketing their products abroad.
