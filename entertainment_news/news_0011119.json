The free app allows users to take part in Spirit Day, the largest and most visible anti-bullying campaign in the world supporting LGBT youth, by making their social media photos purple. The app also offers anti-bullying resources for students, parents, and educators. “Go Purple for #SpiritDay” is available for Apple and Android devices and can be downloaded here . \n“Toyota’s continued sponsorship of the ‘Go Purple for #SpiritDay’ app not only helps raise awareness of the important work being done by GLAAD, it’s a direct reflection of our values across the Toyota family. At Toyota, embracing and celebrating our differences has been strategic to our success,” said Mike Groff, President & CEO of Toyota Financial Services. “Education and communication are key components in ending bullying and the ‘Go Purple for #SpiritDay’ app gives users access to resources to help ensure their schools and neighborhoods are safer places for everyone. Because, when we end bullying, we truly let kids and young adults develop into creative, unique and productive individuals who make our communities stronger, happier and healthier.” \nMillions wear purple on Spirit Day , taking place on October 15, as a sign of support for LGBT youth and to speak out against bullying. Spirit Day was started in 2010 as a response to the young people who had taken their own lives. With GLAAD’s help, Spirit Day has since garnered widespread support from celebrities, TV news and entertainment programs, corporations, organizations, schools, local communities, and even national landmarks. \nAccording to GLSEN’s 2013 National School Climate Survey , 85% of LGBT students report they have been verbally harassed with 65% percent reporting that they have heard homophobic remarks frequently or often in school. GLSEN also reported that 30% of students missed at least one day of school in a given month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable in their school environment. \nShort URL : http://lgbtweekly.com/?p=64763   on Oct 11, 2015.
