Huth's lawsuit also states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion. \nHuth's claims were rejected for a criminal case because the statute of limitations had expired. \nCosby, 78, is scheduled to be deposed in that case Oct. 9. \nFallout from the allegations against Cosby continues, with the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit Catholic school, revoking an honorary degree it presented to Cosby in 2012. The school announced the decision Wednesday, the same day Brown University revoked a doctorate of humane letters it granted Cosby in 1985, and days after Fordham and Marquette universities rescinded degrees they bestowed to Cosby.
