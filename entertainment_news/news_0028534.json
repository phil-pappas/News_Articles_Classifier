On Tuesday, the label won the Mercedes-Benz Start Up contest for emerging designers, earning a fully produced runway show, an editorial spread in Fashion Magazine and a cash award in the form of a $30,000 bursary. \nAs an additional element to the Start Up program, finalists were tasked with creating a “Star Wars”-inspired design in the Disney-sponsored contest. \nSt-Jacques said they decided to bring a fresh approach to Princess Leia’s famed golden bikini worn onscreen by Carrie Fisher in 1983’s “Return of the Jedi” as the character was held captive by Jabba the Hutt. \n“We decided to empower Leia and bring back the chain and make a dress out of it that’s somewhat armour, somewhat very sexy,” said St-Jacques. \nThe pair had no reservations about putting forward their own vision of such a recognizable ensemble. \n“When something is so iconic, it’s easier for people to understand where you started,” said Belanger. \n“You can go quite far from the original design, and if you keep the right elements, people will recognize what you’re talking about and where you’re started from.” \nPeter Noonan of Disney Consumer Products Canada said the UNTTLD creation had a “wow” factor that set the design apart. \n“(It was) the beauty of it, the symmetry of it, the elegance of it,” said Noonan, managing director of licensing. “It would be something you would see at a holiday gala, but it wasn’t necessarily out of place. You could use different fabrications within that Princess Leia esthetic. \n“It spoke to us that it was timeless.” \nIn addition to their cash prize, St-Jacques and Belanger were bestowed with an iconic keepsake of their own from the film franchise. \nOscar-winning “Star Wars” set decorator Roger Christian — the original creator of the lightsaber — served as a guest judge in the contest, and presented the UNTTLD designers with their own commemorative laser swords. \n— Follow @lauren_larose on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:52:43.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
