The magazine is awarding Fallon its Elmer Award for Excellence in Humor. The Harvard Lampoon's Facebook page says the comedian will be crowned \"Emperor of Comedy\" and paraded through Harvard Square in a Roman chariot. The parade will start by the Inn at Harvard and end at the steps of the magazine's headquarters, Lampoon Castle. It's just the seventh time the undergraduate organization says it has bestowed the honor. Previous recipients include Jay Leno, John Cleese and Robin Williams. The 41-year-old Fallon took over \"The Tonight Show\" from Leno last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:44:18.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
