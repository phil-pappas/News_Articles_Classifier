Another has emerald eggs and knife-sharp claws. A third is mostly blind and only comes out at night. \nThe ostrich, the cassowary and the kiwi — and their equally eccentric cousins, the emu and the rhea — have a lot in common. They are flightless. They are songless. They live in the Southern Hemisphere. And most people know zilch about any of them. \n\"Big Birds Can't Fly,\" the latest PBS \"Nature\" special, aims to change all that, and succeeds in charming fashion, even if the title conjures up the Four Seasons singing about a \"Sesame Street\" character. \nThe program, which airs 8 p.m. Wednesday, should appeal not only to viewers who love birds but anyone who wants to learn more about the world they share with strange critters large and small. \nThe hourlong special, showcasing five species of birds in the ratite family, has all the hallmarks that have made the long-running \"Nature\" series so admired for more than three decades — most notably, its incredible and often never-seen-before footage of beasts and birds in the wild. \nIn this instance, it's shots of baby emus emerging from their shells in Australia, a bit-gruesome action sequence of a young ostrich trying to outrun a pack of cheetahs on the plains of Africa, and infrared video of crazy little male kiwis fighting at night in remote New Zealand. \nWhat's more, \"Big Birds Can't Fly\" features David Attenborough, whose expertise and \"voice of God\" narration add to the show's appeal. \nOne fascinating segment is a grainy black-and-white film clip of a young Attenborough from more than 50 years ago, when he visited Madagascar in search of traces of a prehistoric flightless bird so large it was called the elephant bird. \nA youthful Attenborough is seen reconstructing the fragments of one of the bird's huge eggs as though it were a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. The footage is a neat reminder that Attenborough is not just another velvet voice for hire. The 89-year-old knows his subject matter firsthand, and his enthusiasm remains undiminished if far more reserved. \nIt also helps that Attenborough sprinkles his narrative with the latest scientific breakthroughs on these \"Flintstones of the bird world.\" \nAs Attenborough explains, recent DNA research has shown that they are all related to prehistoric creatures that could fly, but that all evolved independently of each other on several continents. \nThe biggest concern with any hourlong educational documentary is whether you can watch that much footage and absorb that much information without suffering from factoid overload. Unless the show is really top-notch, it can seem a task akin to eating one's Brussels sprouts. \nNo worries. \"Big Birds Can't Fly\" is worth your time. The writing is consistently crisp and informative, and the editing is so seamless that the show flies by — which is more than can be said for the birds themselves. \nJim Wright writes \"The Bird Watcher\" column for The Record. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:39:00.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
