Denis Jones will direct.\n\"This is a true passion project for us,\" Steven and Maureen Van Zandt said in a joint statement. \"The incredible contributions that Bert Berns made to our culture have never had a real chance to be appreciated by the public or even been fully acknowledged by the music industry. It's time we celebrate his life and his work.\"\nVan Zandt, who most know as Bruce Springsteen's mugging, bandana-toting band mate, is no stranger to work behind the scenes — he recently produced pop veteran Darlene Love's latest LP, wrote and produced with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes for years, and even acts as the director of musical selection for the wildly successful video game franchise \"Rock Band.\"\n\"Piece of My Heart\" began off-broadway, at Pershing Square Signature Center in New York in July 2014, and was extended by popular demand through Sept. 2014.\n\"When you take the toughest, most emotional songs in Rock and Roll, pair them with the glamorous, romantic story of the bad boy who wrote them, then bring in a team like this one, you've got combustible dynamite!\" Shaffer said in a statement.\nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
