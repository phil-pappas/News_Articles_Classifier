Getty Images \nNick Gordon claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown’s family's lawsuit against him will ultimately prevent him from receiving a \"fair trial\". \nAccording to TMZ , Gordon states in legal documents that his late ex-girlfriend’s family's death lawsuit which portrays him as a \"murderer and scumbag\" will prevent him from ever receiving a \"fair trial\" if prosecuted. \nAccording to the legal documents obtained by TMZ , Gordon alleges that the Brown family have portrayed him as a \"murderer, a habitual batterer of women, a seducer of young white females, a thief and/or con man fueled by monetary gain and a chemist capable of making a toxic cocktail.\" \nAccording to TMZ , Gordon requests that the judge put an end to the Brown’s lawsuit against him. \nGordon requests that the judge cease the $40-million suit \"until the criminal process runs its course\". \nThe reasoning behind Gordon’s request, is that \"the civil case would force him to answer questions that could be used against him\" if he is ever charged.
