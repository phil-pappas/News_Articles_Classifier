He plays a rather smart and conniving character,\" says Akshaye Arjun, who plays one of the lead roles in the film. \"For his first time in a language he is not familiar with, Vinod managed to essay the role with very basic prompting. He shot with us in Bengaluru. Since his wife was in town with him, he would head straight back to the hotel after the shoot,\" adds Akshaye.\nBased on a real-life incident, the film captures the story of Seenu Bettanagere, who was murdered. The film has been directed by Seenu's own brother, Mohan Gowda Bettanagere.
