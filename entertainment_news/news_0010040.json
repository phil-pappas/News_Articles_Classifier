Boasting a new name, a new screen and new all-digital projection and sound systems, the biggest movie screen in the region reopens Thursday (Oct. 15) -- and with some help from an old animated friend.\nA newly restored 3-D version of 1989's animated Disney classic \"The Little Mermaid\" -- previously shown in New Orleans only in its original 2D format -- will join the aquarium's traditional slate of educational \"mission\" films when the facility gets on with the show, following a month-and-a-half-long closure for renovation started Sept. 8.\nDuring that time, crews gave the newly renamed Entergy Giant Screen Theater a planned $1.2 million overhaul. It went swimmingly, too, with director of theater operations Rodney Daniels saying the work actually came in under budget.\nAt first blush, moviegoers might not notice much of a difference.\nThere are signs trumpeting the new name of the theater, which became a necessity when it was decided to drop the IMAX designation it had carried since 1995. Additionally, the lobby has been repainted in deep blues and greens, accenting an existing dolphin mural.\nA similar, fittingly maritime color scheme carries over into the auditorium, complementing the highback seats installed in 2012. \"(We're) not paying homage to Tulane, but there are some Tulane colors,\" Daniels said during a tour of the facility Wednesday.\nRegular visitors also might notice that the screen, which used to stretch from floor to ceiling, doesn't quite go all the way as far down as did the previous screen. \"We lost a few feet, but not enough to where, in my opinion, it makes a difference,\" Daniels said.\nA cyclist rides past the the Aquarium of the Americas' newly renamed Entergy Giant Screen Theater on the riverfront Wednesday (Oct. 15). The theater reopens Thursday after a $1 million digital overhaul. (Mike Scott / The Times-Picayune) Mike Scott, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune It's when the lights go out and the show begins, however, that the real changes will become most evident.\nThat's because the meat of the renovation played out behind the scenes -- namely, in the suddenly roomier projection booth. That's where a Christie 4K digital projector has been installed -- two of them, actually, both projecting the exact same images but atop one another, to ensure maximum brightness in the facility's mammoth auditorium -- and replacing the older, much larger film projector.\nAlongside it are the main components of a new 11.1 Dolby Atmos sound system, which is much smaller than the system it replaced -- but which produces a much bigger audio footprint.\n\"I think the biggest thing people are going to notice is the sound,\" Daniels said.\nPreviously, the theater used a 5.1 surround sound system -- a five-speaker setup similar to that used in many home theaters. Now, as part of the new sound system, dozens of speakers line the ceiling and walls of the auditorium. More are situated out of sight behind the screen. The result gives filmmakers the opportunity to \"place\" sounds in specific parts of the auditorium, making it feel as if they are originating behind the audience, over their heads or in a specific corner.\nThe modernization of the theater came about partly because of Hollywood's ongoing transition to digital distribution methods, meaning the theater was finding it increasingly difficult to find mainstream movies still being distributed in traditional film formats.\nCase in point: \"The Little Mermaid,\" which will screen Thursday through Sunday (Oct. 15 to 18), and again from Oct. 22 to 25. It runs in conjunction with appearances on the same days by the famed Weeki Watchee Springs mermaids in the aquarium's underwater exhibits.\nIt will be joined by daily showings of such nature documentaries as \"Great White Shark 3D,\" \"Hurricane on the Bayou\" and \"Galapagos 3D: Nature's Wonderland.\" Ticket prices are unchanged from what they were before the renovation: $10.50 for adults, $9.50 for seniors and $8 for children 2 to 12.\nFor more information on the Entergy Giant Screen Theatre's upcoming slate, including showtimes and ticketing information, visit the Aquarium of the Americas website .", "external_links": ["http://www.auduboninstitute.org/calendar?tid%5B%5D=325&tid_1%5B%5D=327&date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Bdate%5D=2015-10-14&date_filter_1%5Bvalue%5D%5Bdate%5D=2015-10-31"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:37:52.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
