Researchers Roselyn Lee-Won from The Ohio State University, Leo Herzog from Hope College in Michigan, and Sung Gwan Park from Seoul National University, Korea note that the combined social connections capability and messaging features of Facebook may offer an appealing social media environment for users with social anxiety. \n“Problematic Facebook use seems to result from multi-factorial causes and personality attributes,” said Brenda K Wiederhold, from the Interactive Media Institute, San Diego, California and Virtual Reality Medical Institute, Brussels, Belgium. ”More research into the synergistic nature of these factors and additional issues that should be included in a prediction model of this phenomenon may help aid in future assessment and prevention plans,” said Wiederhold. The study was published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour, and Social Networking. \n 12 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:18:33.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
