(Photo: Mary Hance / The Tennessean) 274 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nI love shopping, I love consignment, I love Hendersonville and I love success stories. \nSo today, I give you news of some happy relocations and expansions of three consignment stores in Hendersonville. \nUp and Down Closet \nFirst up is the Up and Down Closet, which has relocated to a spot next to Publix in Hendersonville. This plus-size ladies consignment shop in Hendersonville, which opened in 2007 on a shoestring and a prayer, was the vision of six plus-size ladies who were tired of not having a good place to buy cute, affordable clothes and saw a need for plus-size clothing. In a previous column, I described it as \"one of local cheapdom's best success stories.\" \nThe entrepreneurial ladies had no real retail experience (other than liking to shop), so as a trial run, they signed a lease for six months. At the end of the lease, whoever wanted to continue the business could. Two became owners, two became employees, and now, more than eight years later, the ownership is all with Sherry Lawler. \nThe most recent challenge came when Lawler was told that the Kmart center, where the shop had been from the beginning, was to be torn down to make way for a new Hendersonville Kroger. The news was daunting at first, but Lawler's real estate search turned up some great space just across Gallatin Road, at 240 East Main St. (next to Publix) and business continues to grow. The shop, which is 500 square feet larger than the old one, now has 1,300 consignors â€” some of whom bring in a couple of pieces at a time and some bring in as many as 200. \nThis shop specializes in ladies sizes 14 and up to 30-32 and 6X, as well as shoes, handbags and accessories. Walk-ins are accepted, but appointments are highly recommended. The split is 50/50. The brands are all over the place (Cato and Old Navy, as well as Chico's, J.Jill, Coldwater Creek, St. John), And that mix is by design, Lawler said. \"We want to be somewhere that people with any size pocketbook can shop.\" \nShe added that \"most of the people who shop and consign here have gained and lost the weight two or three times. It is fluid. That is why we are called what we are called... 'Up and Down Closet' is the name.\" Details: http://www.upanddowncloset.com or 615-264-6569. Be sure to sign up for the customer loyalty card \nThe Mens Room \nAnother happy ending was the move of The Mens Room to a new location at 109 Walton Ferry Road in Hendersonville as a result of the same Kmart redevelopment . This men's consignment shop, that started out in space adjoining the Up and Down Closet, has ended up in a great storefront on Walton Ferry Road, with 400 more square feet and a better setup. \nOwner Kathy Wallace started the shop in March 2010 as a consignment store for big and tall men's clothing, but now caters to men of all sizes, with the larger sizes making up roughly half the store. She has more than 900 consignors and carries shoes, ties and other men's accessories, as well as casual and business clothing for men in sizes small up to as large as she can get. The split is 50/50 between the shop and the consignors. \nDuring my visit, young Carlos Alfaro was preparing for his freshman year at MTSU and was racking up an entire new wardrobe for pennies on the dollar, with some help from Wallace. Alfaro's clothing haul included 18 items for a total for right at $90, including Hollister jeans, a Gap hoodie, several new-looking polos, a nice leather belt and more. \n\"Our new location is one-and-a-half times bigger and $12 a month cheaper,\" Wallace said, noting that another plus for her new location is that there are lots of good affordable eating places nearby, including Thank God Donuts, which I have to say, was amazing!

Their target customer is aged 15-55, which they attract with brands like Tory Burch, Coach, Michael Kors, Lululemon, Anthropology, J.Crew etc. There are lots of designer jeans (brands like Joe's, J Brand, Citizens of Humanity, 7 For All Mankind and more) with most priced under $55, and the additional space also gives them room to carry some brand new merchandise like Umgee and Entro in the under $40 price range. \nI was happy to hear that they were also offering a special section of brands like Chico's, Jones New York, and Eileen Fisher brands to attract additional shoppers (as in older ones like me). \n\"We are also adding a designer section,\" Steenhoven said, explaining that shoppers seem to like having higher-end brands curated in a special area. The shop includes shoes, scarves, jewelry and lots and lots of handbags, that she says sell as fast as they come in. \nThe Steenhovens long-term plan is to open a sister shop in Williamson County and they are introducing themselves to that market through a free VIP pickup service, where she will work by appointment to come to consignors' homes to pick up their pieces. \"I do about five a week,\" she said. \"It gives us a lot of good inventory. We hope to eventually open in Brentwood or Franklin.\" \nDetails. See Bloom Designer Finds on Facebook or 615-477-2378 \nReach Ms. Cheap at 615-259-8282.

Peggy Armstrong is celebrating her 21st year as owner of this popular consignment shop, which has been in business for about 30 years. There are about 800 consignors.
