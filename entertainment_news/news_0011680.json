Twenty-six years after that 1989 movie hit theaters, that day is finally here.\nTo celebrate, AMC, Regal and other North American theater chains will screen the trilogy Wednesday (AMC at 4:29 p.m. local time, the time Marty arrived). The movie trilogy is being re-released on Blu-ray, and Pepsi is selling specially labeled bottles of \"Pepsi Perfect,\" the cola McFly orders in the second film.\n(Good luck getting your hands on a Pepsi Perfect, though -- they were mostly sold out .)\nWhat did 'Back to the Future II' get right?\nRead More And we offer this trivia quiz.\n\"Back to the \"Future's\" predictions about what life would be like in 2015 were part right (big-screen TVs!) and part wrong (hoverboards). We're still not sure about the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series, but right now it's not looking good.\nMaybe you can score better on our quiz.
