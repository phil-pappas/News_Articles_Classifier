It's a role meant to be redemptive, according to Director Eric Rivas. \n\"The first thing I thought was, I’d like to give this man a role with some redemption, considering his situation,\" he said. \"I didn't want to turn him into a bad guy.\" \nBrancato shows off his acting chops in a trailer for the film that was recently posted to YouTube, in which he is seen just a few seconds in apologizing to a woman in the hallway of a building. \n(WARNING: trailer contains profane language) \n\"Sir, can you keep it down out here?\" she asks. \"I have a baby in there sleeping.\" \n\"Sorry lady,\" Brancato responds. \"My bad.\" \nHis character shows up later to utter a classic expression of confusion right before his wife's true identity his revealed. \n\"What the f--- is this?\" his character asks. \n\"Tony, your wife is a witch, una bruja!\" actor Angel Salazar , who starred in \" Scarface \" responds. \nThe movie also features Melle Mel from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and another infamous ex-con, former club promoter Michael Alig . \nBrancato starred as Robert De Niro's son in \"A Bronx Tale\" in 1993 and was charged with murdering a police officer in 2005. \nRivas explained that the role is meant to be a reflection of Brancato's life as a man who made a mistake that he now hopes to atone for. \n\"What I’ve seen from meeting him and all that is he wants to redeem himself,\" he said. \"I literally wrote something that I thought would parallel his real life and his current journey.\" \nBrancato described his character as \"the only normal one\" in the movie and agreed that there were some parallels between his journey in the film and his journey in real life. \n\"I am still to this day trying to redeem myself for past bad decision making and mistakes,\" he said. \"We all make them in life, some worse than others, and in my case I made some pretty bad mistakes and some pretty bad choices.\" \nAlthough Brancato was described as a protégé of De Niro in the wake of his \"Bronx Tale\" performance, later landing roles in \" Enemy of the State \" and \" The Sopranos ,\" his life took a drastically different turn in 2005, when he was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Officer Daniel Enchautegui. \nBrancato and Steven Armento, his partner in crime, had been trying to break into a Bronx home at night on Dec. 10 when Enchautegui, who lived next door, heard the noise and tried to stop them. \nArmento shot the officer in the chest and was convicted of murder, while Brancato was only convicted of attempted burglary. He spent about eight years behind bars before being released in 2013, he said. \n\"I take full responsibility for how my bad decision making contributed to the death of that heroic police officer,\" he said, \"because if I wasn’t there, that wouldn’t have happened, and that's something that I have to live with for the rest of my life.\" \nHis other upcoming film projects include the boxing movie \" Back in the Day \" and the gangster movie \" Monsters of Mulberry Street .\" \nBrancato said he was very grateful for the chance to relaunch his acting career. \n\"To have my freedom again is a blessing, but you take it to the next level when you start getting opportunities to do what you love again,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:32:22.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
