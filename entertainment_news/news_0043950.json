Hello is the first track taken from the album and the video has been directed by Xavier Dolan. \nFans of 90210 will spot actor Tristan Wilds as the love interest in the video, which sees Adele walking around a dusty old house and wandering in the country. Tristan appears throughout and you can just about make out some low dialogue spoken by him and Adele during the video. \nTake a listen to Hello and watch the video below, then vote in our poll and tell us what you think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:39:49.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
