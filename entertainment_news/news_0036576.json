This is against our global commitment to child rights. Reducing the age is not a solution. (Also Read: 2 juveniles apprehended in connection with toddler’s rape) \n“Even if you reduce the age to 15 and then a 14 year-old commits a similar crime, would you again reduce the age?” asked Centre for Social Research Director Ranjana Kumari.”Government has to streamline the law and order situation and the punishment for adult offenders in such crimes has to be made stringent so that it sends out a strong message that rapes will not be tolerated in our society,” she added.According to Sanjay Gupta, Director of Chetna NGO, there are several unattended issues concerning children which needed to be looked into. He said studies should be done to understand crimes by juveniles. \n“This is not a new debate. We need to do homework on why such incidents are happening in society. There are several unattended issues of children which need looking into instead of just reducing the age of juveniles.”There is no engagement plan for school drop-outs or for children out of school. Also, sex education should be imparted in primary and secondary schools along with counselling sessions,” said Gupta. \nModified Date: October 19, 2015 10:27 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:41:00.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
