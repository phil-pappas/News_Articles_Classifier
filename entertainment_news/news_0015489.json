Sadarame, which was originally scripted by Bellave Narahari Shastry. Samashti's experiment on Sadarame is cleverly plotted and quite different from the original story. The story revolves around an innocent middle-class girl Sadarame, where a prince who was attracted to her and wanted to marry her, sacrificed his kingdom to his greedy father-in-law and left the kingdom along with the newly-wed Sadarame. Unknown to the new world, Sadarame was exposed to difficult circumstances by the cunning travelers of the story. With the help of her extravagant intelligence, Sadarame managed to escape from all the troubles and finally remains Miss. Sadarame.\nThis is a crazy and humorous journey that criticizes the present social scenario.\nThe artistes of the play are Krithi B Shetty, Halliga Raghavendra Prasad C, Chatradhipathi Manjunath MS, Kalahamsa Ravikumar JV, Halliga Kantharaju NC, Renuka Prasad C, Gangadhar Karikere, Leelavathi Thanuja R, Shrinivas Prasad C, Brunda KG, Kalla Anand P and Mithra Nagaraj M.\nIt is scheduled to take place on October 16 (7.30 pm) at Ranga Shankara, 36/2 8th Cross II Phase, JP Nagar.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/emotions/play"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:45:41.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
