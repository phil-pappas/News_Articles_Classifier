Photo: Supplied\nCanberra firefighters can be called to a multitude of jobs: bushfires, house fires, car crashes, white powder scares. Maybe even a cat stuck in a tree.\nBut firefighters tucked away in a suburban street in Evatt on Wednesday were undertaking a different kind of rescue operation.\nAt a time when Canberrans are ducking for cover from aggressive swooping magpies , a group of firies helped give a nest of clumsy, five-day-old chicks a second chance at life.\nFirefighters used a Bronto to rescue the baby magpies. Photo: Supplied\nACT Fire & Rescue West Belconnen station officer Paul Flynn was among firefighters and ACT Wildlife members who headed to Sprouleâ€‹ Circuit about midday to rescue a nest of baby magpies.\nAdvertisement Mr Flynn said a resident who discovered the nest a few days earlier phoned ACT Fire & Rescue when the chicks' mother disappeared.\n\"She started feeding the mother and the mother took the scraps back up to the babies,\" he said.\nSenior Firefighter Stuart Laing with the basket of rescued baby magpies. Photo: Supplied\n\"As of Tuesday night the mum seemed to have disappeared. [The resident] noticed currawongs were starting to look at the baby magpies.\"\nMr Flynn said the rescue wasn't a simple ladder-against-a-trunk operation.\n\"When we got there the nest was up about eight metres off the ground,\" he said.\n\"The tree was too flimsy and it was a bit breezy. We didn't think it was safe enough to put up a ladder.\"\nThe firefighters called for enforcements in the form of the Bronto, a fire truck with an attached crane and basket.\nMr Flynn said a senior firefighter, Stuart Laing, braved any chance of facing the angry mother and was hoisted up to the nest to retrieve the four chicks, which were carried down in a small basket.\n\"We thought, what happens if we get up there and the mother is nearby - she's going to really crack it,\" Mr Flynn said.\n\"There were four little chicks all up - one was quite runty. We didn't think he would survive. He was missing feathers. His jaw was out of alignment.\"\nACT Wildlife volunteers fed the hungry chicks an insect paste before they were taken to the shelter.\nMr Flynn said firefighters were called to the odd bird rescue however, he had never helped rescue native baby birds from a tree before.\n\"That's the first time I remember doing that,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:04:52.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
