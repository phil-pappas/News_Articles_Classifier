He had scheduled classes Tuesdays and Thursdays this semester, so he would've likely been on campus Thursday. \nSkarlatos is an Oregon National Guard member who in August, along with fellow Americans Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler (and a Brit and two Frenchman), prevented a gunman from opening fire on a train headed to Paris from Amsterdam. \nSkarlatos -- who has many friends in the area -- reportedly left rehearsal Thursday immediately upon hearing about the shooting and flew back to Oregon.
