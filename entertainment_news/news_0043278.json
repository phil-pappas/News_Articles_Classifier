The singer dressed up as Storm from X-Men for Ciara 's birthday party on Saturday and completely nailed it. (Would you expect anything else?) As for the birthday girl Ciara, she dressed as Catwoman, while her boyfriend Russell Wilson went as Batman. Based on pictures from social media, Beyonce's former Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland also attended the party. #HAPPYBIRTHDAYANGIE!! WOMENARESUPERHEROES A photo posted by kellyrowland (@kellyrowland) on Oct 25, 2015 at 12:46pm PDT Last year, Beyonce donned two costumes. For one, she and daughter Blue Ivy went as Janet and Michael Jackson. For the second, she and husband Jay-Z went as Frida Kahlo and Jean-Michel Basquiat. We can't wait to see if she'll bust out a second outfit this year, but it will definitely have a hard time topping her Storm getup.
