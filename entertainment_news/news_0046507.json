But this is the first time Vimeo has underwritten projects produced specifically for its platform.\nThe site doesn’t carry advertising, and instead is investing in original material to encourage more viewers to pay for content though either renting or buying access to shows and movies . The move is also designed to encourage more creators to post content.\nVimeo’s business model makes it something of the anti-YouTube . Creators can pay Vimeo a monthly fee to host their content; it isn’t geared for user-generated content. And the creators that sell or rent videos share 10% of their revenue with Vimeo. Individual episodes of shows can cost just 99 cents, while full-length movies can run $10 and multi-season series can cost a few hundred dollars.\nAmong the three new projects is a second season of the born-on-the-Web series “The Outs,” which made its debut on Vimeo in 2013. That show, which focuses on young gay life in New York City, was created by actor and director Adam Goldman. Now Vimeo is pumping money into a second season of the show, in hopes that it follows the same sort of pattern as “High Maintenance”-- a pot-dealer-centric comedy that took off on Vimeo and was eventually picked up by HBO.\nAccording to Vimeo Chief Executive Kerry Trainor, “The Outs” has a larger fan base than “High Maintenance” did prior to its second season. While he declined to share any viewership data on either show, he noted that Vimeo’s overall pool of creators and viewers willing to pay for content on demand continues to swell.\n“This show is very similar story to ‘High Maintenance,’” he said. “We are focused on creators who we think are taking Web video creative to new levels of quality--that is what Vimeo is about. And it’s got an already proven, loyal fan base. So it’s the perfect kind of bet for us.”\nIAC revealed over the summer that Vimeo’s paid subscriber base jumped 25% in the second quarter from the same period a year ago to nearly 630,000. These subscriptions start at $59.95 a year.\nVimeo now has 25,000 titles for sale from 8,000 creators and expects to have a million paying consumers by year-end, he said.\nAmong the other bets Vimeo is making on originals are an upcoming stand-up comedy special featuring Bianca Del Rio and a short film called “Darby Forever,” created by “Saturday Night Live” cast member Aidy Bryant.\nMs. Bryant’s project, which like “The Outs” will premiere in early 2016, is the latest example of a celebrity using Vimeo to produce an alternative passion project of sorts. Last year the comedians and actors Rob Corddry (“Hot Tub Time Machine”) and Mark Duplass (FX’s “The League”) used Vimeo to release and sell the original series “Wedlock.”\nIn each case, these are premium Web shows that are off limits to marketers.\n“We’re seeing more artists looking to do something directly with their fans. And they’re not going to do something like that on YouTube,” Mr. Trainor said. “And with us, they are free of any restrictions from advertisers.”\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/IACI/826418579x0x841596/EA812EB6-B798-466D-B5B8-B5D66FA0D6C1/IAC_Reports_Q2_2015.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:14:56.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
