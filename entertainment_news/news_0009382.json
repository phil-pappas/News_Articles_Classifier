The actress spoke about her role, preparation and her relationship with 9-year-old co-star Jacob Tremblay.\nFor 'Room' scenes in which Jack and Ma are held captive, Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson shot in a 10-by-15-foot room on the drama's Toronto set.

Seeing himself onscreen, \"it makes me feel good,\" he chimes, legs dangling off a bench in a Midtown movie theater. \"It makes me feel like, if you do lots of effort, you get all this stuff and awards and\" — he whispers — \"more toys.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBrie Larson charms her way through a Fallon game\nChestnut hair slicked back and smartly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater, Tremblay certainly has cleaned up since his ponytailed days in Room (opens in New York and Los Angeles Friday, nationwide Nov. 6), playing a 5-year-old boy named Jack who knows nothing of the outside world. That's because Jack has spent his whole life locked in a backyard shed with his fiercely protective mother (Brie Larson), who was kidnapped as a teenager, raped repeatedly by her captor (Sean Bridgers) and eventually plots a way to escape.\nBased on Emma Donoghue's best-selling 2010 novel of the same name, the tense thriller has proven to be a tear-jerking crowd-pleaser, winning the coveted People's Choice Award at Toronto International Film Festival last month. Past winners include 12 Years a Slave , The King's Speech and Slumdog Millionaire , all of which have gone on to win best picture at the Academy Awards.\nBrie Larson talks to her young co-star Jacob Tremblay during a 'Room' media conference at Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 14. (Photo: Mike Windle, Getty Images)\nBefore Room even published, Donoghue wrote the screenplay \"before anyone could tell me what to do,\" she says. \"I (was) happy for there to be no film rather than a soppy one or a creepy one, so I said a lot of 'No's.\" The Irish-Canadian author and mother of two eventually said yes after receiving an impassioned 10-page letter from filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson ( Frank ), himself a parent, who embraced the challenge of telling an often dark but ultimately uplifting story from a child's perspective.\nTremblay, whose only major credit before Room was voicing a character in The Smurfs 2, was found in a casting search of hundreds. Larson, meanwhile, has been a star on the rise, building her résumé with roles in 2010's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and 2012's 21 Jump Street and earning critical acclaim for 2013's Short Term 12 , playing a counselor at a foster-care facility for troubled teens.\nUSA TODAY\n'Room' wins TIFF People's Choice award\n\"She has this incredible ease in front of the camera,\" says Abrahamson, who first saw her in Short Term 12 . \"It's like she has this presence, but she's not self-conscious about it, she's not parading it. There's a truthfulness and believability to everything she does.\"\nLarson, 26, who pundits have identified as the best-actress frontrunner on awards site GoldDerby.com , went Method to prepare for the character of Ma. Adopting a carb-free diet and talking to a trauma specialist, she also cloistered herself at home for a month before shooting, avoiding nearly all communication with friends and family.\nAfter escaping the 'Room' where they've been held captive, Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay) flip through her belongings in her childhood home. (Photo: George Kraychyk)\n\"Through that silence, I was able to remember a lot of memories from my childhood that I had only seen through my child eyes,\" Larson says. In particular, she reflected on her experience growing up in a one-room Los Angeles apartment with her younger sister and mom, who was going through a divorce at the time but put on a brave face for her kids.\n\"You're always trying to find the way that you can reach whatever this character is,\" Larson says. \"I didn't know what my mom's experience was like during that period of time at all. But I found that the movie would be a chance to explore that thematically and see what came up.\"\nRoom was filmed mostly sequentially, which meant Larson and Tremblay spent the first half of the 10-week shoot squashed in a 10-by-15-foot space with Abrahamson and a crew. Playing games, cracking jokes and making toys to use as props, the actors had an instant connection that carried them through the heavier, more emotional moments.\nIn one particular scene midway through the film, \"Brie had gone to the very limit: bawling, crying, falling over,\" Abrahamson remembers. \"As soon as I called 'Cut,' Jake was there like, 'Hey, why are you still crying? We're not filming anymore. What's your favorite Star Wars character? Who would win in a fight: a saber-toothed tiger or a mammoth?' And that made her laugh.\n\"In a way that Jack helps Ma survive, Jake really helped Brie through this process.\"\nA mother and child are held captive in a 10-by-10 foot space for years. Ma does all she can to make Jack's life fulfilling, but as Jack gets older it becomes clear that they must escape into the real world.
