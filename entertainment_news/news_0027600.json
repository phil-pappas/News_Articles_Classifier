It stars Sarah Snook (the aforementioned radiant one) as Anna (now a tennis pro instead of an aristocrat). Last Sunday, Snook went up against Priyanka Chopra​, a former Miss World who plays FBI trainee Alex Parrish in Channel Seven's Quantico​ .\nQuantico drew an audience of 625,000 in Australia's mainland capitals and The Beautiful Lie drew 540,000. Between them they just about wiped out Channel Ten's Limitless , which managed a mere 455,000, putting a tiny dent in Ten's delight in its success with The Bachelorette , which keeps scoring above 900,000.\nThe Verdict launched with 520,000 viewers but dropped to 357,000 in its second week. Photo: Seven \nAs well as rolling out a squadron of new shows right now, the networks are being ruthless in disposing of any that don't quickly measure up. Seven axed a hypnotism show called Mesmerised after only one week because it drew 411,000. What does this imply about the fate of The Verdict , Karl Stefanovic's noisy homage to Q&A ? It launched with 520,000 and dropped to 357,000 in its second week (while its ABC inspiration pulled the usual 596,000). Stefanovic is a buddy of Nine boss David Gyngell, so he may last a little longer than Seven's hypnotist.\nAdvertisement OzTAM estimates these were the most watched shows in the week ending October 19:\n#1 The Block (Nine), 1.14 million\n#2 800 Words (Seven), 1.05m\n#3 Nine News Sunday (Nine), 1.05m\n#4 Seven News Sunday (Seven), 1.05m\n#5 The X Factor (Seven),1.02m", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:16.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
