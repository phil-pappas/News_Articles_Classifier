Oliphant is certified as a quality engineer and a professional building analyst through the Building Performance Institute. \"At 14 years old, I was already remanufacturing vending machines with my dad's company,\" Oliphant said. \"That is actually where I got started doing quality inspections. After getting my bachelor's degree at Southern Illinois University, I decided to focus on quality. I got certified as a quality engineer through the American Society for Quality. I do inspections to make sure I'm following the voice of the customer as well as industry standards regulations. What ultimately got me into home inspections was a friend at SIU. We ended up doing several claims during the flood of the Missouri River for FEMA.\" Oliphant also became a licensed home inspector for the state of Illinois. In doing so, he also started his own quality consulting business, which came to be known as Oliphant Innovations Inc. \"I decided to shift and bring quality to home inspections. Home inspections are just about adhering to a set of standards and regulations, and quality just means that you are keeping up with the given regulations for an industry,\" Oliphant said. \"My background is of continuous improvement and efficiency. I have been constantly working to make things better. Having this background means I make sure everything is running as well as possible.\" Having joined the home inspection organization, InterNACHI, continuous education is expected of him. They want their inspectors to be the absolute best they can, according to Oliphant. \"I inspect residential and commercial properties to inspect their overall conditions and to find defects or safety hazards. I also give recommendations on necessary repairs. With the energy efficiency aspect, I calculate air leakage to ensure there is no air flow and insulation in thermal boundary; the area of the home covered in insulation,\" Oliphant said. \"I use a blower door, which simulates a 20 mile per hour wind on all sides of the house to check for air leaks. I have an infrared camera that, during the home inspection, pinpoints hard-to-find leaks that normally would not have been detected. This also identifies hot spots, or wires, with infestation and/or inadequate insulation. Doing this certainly identifies potential safety hazards. I am the only one in the community using this technology.
