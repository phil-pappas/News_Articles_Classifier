Winning is seen as a ticket to playing the greatest venues in the world and has helped to launch the careers of pianists such as Maurizio Pollini (1960) and Martha Argerich (1965). \nThe juried performances are open to the public and always sell out. \nBorn in 1810 in Zelazowa Wola, near the Polish capital, Frederic Chopin fled his homeland just before the 1830 uprising against the occupying forces of Tsarist Russia.\nThe composer later lived in the Austrian capital Vienna before moving to Paris, where he died aged 39 after years of poor health. \nDescribed by 19th century German composer Robert Schumann as \"cannons hidden among blossoms\", Chopin's music remains a symbol of Poland's long struggle for freedom.\n\nChopin Poland Paris Conservatoire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:05:28.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
