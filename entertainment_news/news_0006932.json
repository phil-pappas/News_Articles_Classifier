(Playboy magazine) Related Links \nLos Angeles - It's the end of an au naturel era. Deciding that less skin is the key to future success, Playboy says it will no longer run photos of completely naked women. \nHere's a look back at some of the most famous models who have bared all - or most - in the magazine's pages. \n1. Marilyn Monroe. The first issue - December 1953 - featured the former Norma Jeane Mortenson on the cover, and sold more than 50 000 copies. \n2. Ursula Andress. The Bond girl made the June 1965 issue a best-seller and then returned to pose again at age 45 in December 1981. \n3. Barbi Benton. Modeling by age 16, by 18 she was a regular on TV's Playboy After Dark. Before long she began dating the show's host, Hugh Hefner. She appeared on the cover four times between 1969 and 1985, though she was never a Playmate of the Month. \n4. Cindy Crawford. The supermodel came off the runway to pose nude for fashion photographer Herb Ritts in July 1988. A decade later she and Ritts teamed up again for an October 1998 cover shoot. \n5. Pamela Anderson. The all-time covers champ, with a total of 13 appearances between 1989 and 2011. \n6. Drew Barrymore. Hard to imagine Drew as a sex symbol appearing on the Playboy cover with a pair of shocking pink panties, but her rebel self posed in just that on the January 1995 issue. \n7. Charlize Theron. SA's Golden Girl also took off her bra on the May 1999 cover. The now critically-acclaimed starlet probably won't go nude for anything less than an Oscar these days. \n8. Naomi Campbell. This runway model traded in her high fashion outfits for some raunchy nude poses in the December 1999 issue. \n9. Kim Kardashian. The reality TV star steamed up the cover in 2007 just as Keeping Up With the Kardashians started to air. Although she may have matured with a 2-year-old daughter and son on the way, Kim has found other magazines to bare it all . \n10. Lindsay Lohan. Before her stint at mandatory rehab, former child star Lindsay Lohan tried to pull off a Marilyn on the January/February 2012 cover.
