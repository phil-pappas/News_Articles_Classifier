Songwriter/producer Van Norden has released his latest single “ Love At First Sight ,” an EDM/pop inspired track with thumping trance beats and the soaring vocals of Natalie Major. It's a rush of excitement and energy that you can't help but dance to. Though influences like Basement Jaxx and Moby bleed through, it's not an exact copy. The release is especially impressive since dance music isn't Norden's specialty. Rather he is the lead songwriter and singer for LA based country roots band SPINdrifter. Judging from this single, it's clear Norden is a closet EDM fan. While the single is currently available to stream online, it can also be found the upcoming EP “At First Sight” out November 17. The release will feature more remixes of “Love at First Sight.”\nWhen he's not making dance music or fronting SPINdrifter, Van Norden can be found collaborating with acoustic artists both in Los Angeles and Canada. He's also worked with filmmakers and media artists giving him a wider scope which he applies to his music. To find about more about Van Norden and to hear more of his music, follow him on Instagram and Twitter .\nTracklisting:\n1. Love At First Sight - Radio Edit\n2. Love At First Sight - An_Hero Subliminal Remix\n3.
