Now 23, she’s ready to take on the demanding performance that requires equal levels of singing, dancing and acting. She saw the film shortly before she auditioned for the stage show and knew how much power it had when it debuted. \nAccording to the Internet Movie Database, the original film grossed more than $200 million, becoming the third highest-grossing film in 1983. \n“It translates really well to the stage,” Macchio says of the story of “Flashdance.” “It’s bringing the audience exactly what they want from the movie, including all of their favorite songs. But it’s also bringing another layer of plot, bringing in more back story to some of the characters.” \nThe show does feature new music, too, composed by Robbie Roth with lyrics by Roth and Robert Cary. Fans will still hear old favorites from the film, including “Gloria,” “Maniac” and “What A Feeling,” too. Other iconic moments, such as the famous water drop, will make their way on stage, too, Macchio adds. \nShe says it’s a very physically demanding role — something apparent from fans of the film, who only have to think of the dance training montage Alex Owens does to the song “Maniac” and picture a sweaty mess. She’s running in place, circling her hips and stretching her quads in a progressively more exhausting routine. Macchio says her past work has put her with Radio City and Lincoln Center on shows, but this is the most demanding role she’s had. \n“It’s a musical, first and foremost. It’s a lot of music. You’re singing the whole time. I try my best to rest when I can, though it’s hard because I love to talk,” she says with a laugh. “It’s taking a lot of self-discipline.” \nThough it tells the story of one woman’s journey to her dream, “Flashdance” tells a story anyone can relate to, Macchio says. The main character, Alex, works as a welder by day and as an exotic dancer at night, but she dreams of a chance at a career in ballet. \n“I feel like I’m telling my story, just in a different context,” she says of Alex’s journey. “With roles like this, you learn so much about yourself. \n“I think it’s appropriate for anybody from any background,” she continues. “It’s about a girl fighting for her dream. Everyone has. How far will you go to get that?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:56:50.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
