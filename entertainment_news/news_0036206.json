Cheryl takes the Groups to Rome, Simon takes the Overs to the South of France, Rita takes the Girls to LA... and Nick takes the Boys to the Cotswolds. Awkward. Join us from 8pm and we'll bring you all the action live as it happens. We can't wait to comment on all of the judges' interior design prowess (and also, we suppose, whether the acts are any good). In the meantime, here's 8 of the past best ever Judges' Houses moments - we wonder what kind of tears, celebrity cameos and pool-jumping antics we've got in store this evening? © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia22:22And that's it! It took two and a half hours, but we made it! We're so glad that our favourites Fourth Impact, Anton and Bupsi all made it through, but we are still so disappointed that Jennifer didn't make it. JUSTICE FOR JENNIFER. We're back tomorrow to go through the decisions for the boys and see Rita tackle the girls, so join us from 7.30pm on Sunday 25th October 2015 to catch all the action live as it happens! GOODNIGHT EVERYONE, and let's hope the ghost of Sinitta at Simon's house in the South of France doesn't haunt your dreams.22:18So it turns out that the actual live decisions for the boys won't be made until tomorrow and the whole shebang for the girls will happen then. There's more general awkward presenter chat with no one really knowing when to speak. We're not sure at how well the live judges' houses thing has gone, to be honest.22:16Nick and Mark have their decision chat. They describe one act as \"he excites me and terrifies me at the same time\". Brilliant. There's lots of shots to show how nice the house is and how lovely the furniture is, but come on guys. You aren't fooling us. It's still the COTSWOLDS. Rita Ora went to LOS ANGELES. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 22:15We have Josh Daniel, who we have always really liked from the beginning. He sings 'Style' by Taylor Swift, which is an INCREDIBLE SONG AND A GREAT CHOICE. We are also incredibly happy to see that he doesn't change any gender references. What we are however disappointed at is the fact Josh wears his coat throughout the performance and completely misses the opportunity to shed it at the \"takes off his coat\" line. Honestly, Josh. We know he doesn't have the best voice, but we really like him, so we hope he makes it through. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 22:12Next is Che Chesterman, who has had consistently amazing vocals throughout the whole competition so far. He's going to sing his mum and dad's wedding song, which is 'I Don't Know Much' by Linda Rondstadt and Aaron Neville. This reminds us of when Sam Bailey sang OUR mum and dad's wedding song, 'The Power Of Love' by Jennifer Rush, another gloriously 80's wedding song choice. Che absolutely BRINGS THE SONG HOME, and has a completely incredible voice. We bet his mum and dad are proud of him. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 22:08Next up we have Ben Clark! We unfairly speculated earlier about how upset Ben Clark must have been at ending up in the Cotswolds, and he actually looks fairly content. He sings 'Yours' by Ella Henderson, and manages to make it sound like it was always sung by a gravelly guitary type. Like, it could be his winners' single. We quite like it actually and will be disappointed if he doesn't make it through. But we can't imagine any of the other boys not making it through either. It's quite a strong category, actually, isn't it? © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 22:02This episode has now officially been on for two hours and shows no sign of finishing yet. We will be spending this advert break inspecting the mirror for any new wrinkles that have come on since the beginning of the episode.22:00Finally we have Mason Noise, who wants to be seen as a nice person again after having been called an arsehole. So he - and this is literally true - picks a song by renowned Nice Person and overall good contributor by humanity, Robin Thicke ('Lost Without U'). He is actually really good though, which is a little bit annoying. In fact, we think he might have been the best so far. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 21:57Next up we have Simon Lynch from the Isle of Man. He sings Too Lost In You by the Sugababes, which is basically the BEST SONG EVER, and it's a great performance. We have tingles, and usually we can be a bit bored by the ballads. Well done Simon. Mark calls Simon 'Twilight' which is pretty good nicknaming skills. Well done Mark.21:54Seann Miley Moore sings 'This Woman's Work' by Kate Bush, a song that always reminds him of his mum. We really like this song and it's an emotional performance. Whilst watching his performance back Seann bursts into tears and needs to be hugged by Che. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 21:51Nick introduces his Judges Houses' Mate to everyone... the Handsome Mark Ronson. We always wondered if he'd be a good X Factor judge himself, actually, so we're quite interested to see how he does.21:49Next up we have Nick. Back in The Past he meets his boys at radio 1, tells them about the Mason Noise swap fiasco (Seann Miley Moore is SO excited) and then reveals to them they are staying in the UK but getting there in a helicopter. No Nick. That's not enough. Jess Glynne got a free holiday to Rome AND to go in a helicopter.21:46Incredible.Anton watching himself back is like a proud parent at the school Nativity. #XFactorJudgesHouse pic.twitter.com/IVNY8OJi1r— Sian Welby (@Sianwelby) October 24, 201521:44Right, sorry, we're calming down. Given the track record of this show Jennifer will probably end up back on the show in a couple of weeks anyway, right?!21:43Watch Max win. Do we as a country really want an X Factor winner who HATES FUN?21:41Well, we're not sure how to feel about that. Anton? Yes. Bupsi? YASSSS. Max 'Person on the Bus' Stone? WHAT. Simon said before picking Max that he had changed his mind from previously, and we wonder who he had in mind. We personally feel Jennifer was robbed. ROBBED.21:40And the overs that Simon will be taking through are....(tension)BUPSI!!!(we may be many miles away, but our screams of joy are heard live on ITV)(more tension)ANTON!!!(no one has ever looked as happy about anything)(more live show mess with no one being able to hear what anyone is saying and oh god what even is this new format)(another ten second countdown OH GOD WHAT IS THIS FEATURE)Max. MAX.21:35It's time for Simon to make his decisions! First of all we have the Begging Round. We feel so uncomfortable watching people tearfully beg for their place. Anton of course delivers his begging speech like a Shakespearean soliloquy.21:32Simon and Louis have a candlelit chat discussing who they think they're going to put through. The log fire looks great. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 21:31Next up we have Anton. WE LOVE ANTON. As usual, his VT's come off a little more Children In Need than X Factor, but there you go, we still love him. Simon interrupts Anton's pre-audition chat by saying he thinks he just saw a ghost. (Did you really think Sinitta would let you get away without inviting her to Judges Houses', Simon?) Anton sings 'Superstar' by The Carpenters and he's really good, obviously. We love him so much. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 21:28We've got Kerrie-Anne next. She gave up her job as a teacher to come on X Factor (although she wouldn't have got the time off in termtime anyway, right?). She sings 'The Best Of My Love\" showing off some absolutely incredible pins (we can't believe that we just typed \"incredible pins\", who have we become? Well, we've been liveblogging for an hour and a half now) and some great vocals.The song choice is a little dated though, and it does get on a bit. Louis looks really bored throughout and at the ends says he doesn't think there's anything original about her. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 21:21Next up we have Max Who Hates Fun. Remember him? He hates fun. Unfortunately he brings a guitar, which doesn't do a whole lot for his Hating Fun image. He does an acoustic cover of 'Gangsta's Paradise'. You read that right. An ACOUSTIC COVER of GANGSTA'S PARADISE. Jesus, Max. You couldn't just let ONE thing remain fun? To be fair, if you enjoy white men in their mid twenties with guitars covering hip hop classics, if that's really your kind of thing, then he does a good job of it. And he does completely slay the last chorus. So well done Max. Maybe you can learn to love fun after all. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 21:16So Bupsi rocks up, looking absolutely incredible, obviously. She sings 'Pony' by Ginuwine, an absolutely inspired song choice and Louis loves it. OF COURSE HE DOES WHO WOULDN'T. She throws Simon a stage wink after the lyric \"get nasty, baby\". What a woman. We could all do with being a bit more Bupsi. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 21:14BUPSI KLAXON!!!21:11It's not too late for Sinitta to rock up, right? She could still turn up from behind a pot plant. Right?21:09Next up we have Ebru, who we absolutely LOVED at the Six Chair Challenge so we're hoping for good things. She sings 'Photograph' by Ed Sheeran and we aren't blown away. We also have always really hated the lyric \"you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans\" which we've always felt quite disturbing and not only because of how much we hate ripped jeans. (There's some lovely candlesticks in the background of this shot, by the way. Look out for them). As soon as she finishes the performance she bursts into tears. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 21:05First up we have Jennifer Phillips, 49 from Camden Town. She's singing a One Direction song, 'Drag Me Down', and she's very nervous to perform it in front of Louis Tomlinson, which is understandable as he is of course famed for his incredible vocals. It's obviously brilliant and it's nice to see her do something a bit different. We really like Jennifer. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 21:02Anyway, back in The Past Simon has whisked his Overs over to the South of France. His Judges' House Mate is Louis Tomlinson, who gives sage advice on nerves to people over twice his age.21:01There's an incredibly awkward exchange where Caroline points out that the judges don't actually live in their houses, hilariously to all viewers. However Simon replies with \"oh I do own this one. I just bought it!\" hilariously, and the two incredibly wealthy celebrities have a bit of house-owning banter. Meanwhile we are sitting at home watching the X Factor painfully aware that like most young people in the country we are unlikely to ever our own home. Simon can't remember if he owns a house! HOW HILARIOUS. Honestly.20:59TERRIFYING.WHAT? THEY ARE MAKING THEM BEG. BEGGING IS NOW A \"ROUND\" IN THE #XFACTOR. EVERYONE! THEY ARE MAKING THE BEG. WHAT? WHAT?— Vittoria Gallagher (@Vitt2tsnoc) October 24, 201520:55So it appears that next up we have Simon, and you know what that means? BUPSI. Thank God. This episode could do with some Bupsi. (We are literally not even halfway through this episode yet).20:53I mean, the only two groups we really loved did make it through anyway, but we still can't help feeling that we aren't sure that Reggie n Bollie making it through was the right decision talent-wise. BEKLN Mile in particular were robbed.20:52And the groups that Cheryl will be taking through are (tension)Fourth Impact!(very long pause and additional tension)Alien Uncovered! (general live TV chaos with nobody knowing when they're supposed to talk and Simon refusing to give Cheryl advice)(just in general, the most awkward and overlong process of saying out three names that there has ever been in the history of the universe)(there is now literally a ten second countdown THIS IS NOT NASA)Reggie n Bollie!20:47IT'S TIME! FOR THE GROUP! DECISIONS! Bear with us, as this is literally being decided live. The groups are all given a chance to plead for their place. It seems like Anton last week has had a bad influence on everyone. It's all the generic X Factor \"THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO US\" guff you'd expect, but there's quite an exciting moment where Alien Uncovered's microphone cuts out and quite a cringey moment where BEKLN Mile sing their plea. Fourth Impact insist that they are not only fighting for their dreams, \"but for their lives\". Literally, that is what they say. I wonder if the people who don't get through will fall through a trapdoor to Simon's hounds?20:44Cheryl and Jess have a little chat (which surely is meaningless as it is filmed quite some time before the actual live decision, right?) and there's some very nice upholstery going on. There's some dramatic footage of the contestants talking about How Much This Means To Them. Imagine if one year someone just went \"I'm not that bothered, really, but it was nice to have a free holiday.\" Imagine. © ITV / Thames/Syco/FremantleMedia 20:43Finally we have the New Kings Order. They used to be called the First Kings, but it appears they decided that rather than a name inspired by royalty it's better to have a name that sounds like a totalitarian regime that overthrew the royalty instead. One of them is a bit poorly and can't sing, and they sing 'This I Promise You' by N*Sync (great reaction to the \"dated 90's boyband\" criticism, guys). They sound good, but it is a little bit cheesy. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 20:40Next we have Reggie n Bollie. They introduce themselves as \"my name's Reggie, and my name's Bollie. And together we are REGGIE N BOLLIE.\" Guys, you're not Jedward. You're never going to be Jedward. I'm a bit worried they're going to send them both through just to shove them into red latex catsuits and have them perform 'Oops I Did It Again' and do their own backing vocals. They do 'Twist n Shout', and it's just full of joy, but we have seen better performances at karaoke on the working men's club on a Thursday night, to be honest. Our favourite thing about the whole performance is the live feed of Reggie n Bollie dancing and clapping along to their own performance back in the studio. In other news, Jess is now so bored of the performances that she needs subtitles as her voice is so monotone. Literally. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 20:33We now have BEKLN Mile, who used to be called just BEKLN. BEKLN was bad enough, to be honest - it sounded like a make of middling-quality extension leads - but, however, when asked to change their name, they have appeared to opened a dictionary and picked the first noun they came across to add on as a suffix. They sing Lay Me Down by Sam 'Really Exciting Musical Act' Smith. Maybe it's just us and our lack of understanding of 'Real Music' but we're a little bored. Get out the chairs, guys. We need a DANCE ROUTINE. Jess isn't sure if she would be consistently entertained watching it week in/week out though, but then again, we're not sure if Jess would be particularly entertained by anything, as everything she says just sounds to us like \"pint of milk. Bread. Cheese. Ham. Don't forget to bring the carrier bag, it'll cost you 5p otherwise.\" © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 20:28Next up we have Melody Stone, who used to be called Silvertone. We quite liked Silvertone but Melody Stone sounds a bit like something you would find in the New Look Label Lounge, which incidentally appears to be where they have gone to get their outfits. Although with all due respect, they have a lovely colour scheme, and we appreciate a band with a good colour scheme. They sing 'Heaven' by Emeli Sande and it's not like it's BAD or anything... but it's just not that special. It is not one of their better performances. There is a little box in the corner showing their live reactions and they all look a little bit gutted. Jess thinks they have amazing outfits but she's not sure where they would FIT. Which is probably a fair comment. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 20:21We are CACKLING.Preview of Alien Uncovered's wind tunnel makeover #xfactor pic.twitter.com/OyJEef5aZ1— Tony Bannister (@Ohanthonio) October 24, 201520:19Next we have Alien Uncovered, who used to be called just Alien. They have a CHAIR-BASED DANCE ROUTINE. We LOVE chair based dance routines! They sing 'Bad Girl' by Usher, and we're impressed. We used to not like Alien Uncovered very much, but we do feel that with every performance we like them even more. This is SO slick. Cheryl and Jess love it. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 20:15FOURTH IMPACT KLAXON. Fourth Impact used to be called Fourth Power, which probably sounded slightly more like a cult than Fourth Impact, so we aren't too bothered about the name change. They sing the part II remix of 'Love The Way You Lie' by Rihanna ft Eminem and it's quite lovely but in our opinion it doesn't have the 'impact' (see what we did there) of some of their previous performances. © ITV / Syco/Thames/FremantleMedia 20:13Cheryl describes her Judges Houses' Mate as 'important' and 'relevant' as they approach in a helicopter and it turns out they are....Jess Glynne! I mean, who cares how good friends Cheryl and Jess are? At least Jess is RELEVANT. That's all we look for in a friend, really. Relevance.20:12So it looks as though Cheryl's first up and we have a flashback to the past. All of the groups have met up at the airport (always a good sign, at least you know you're not going to the Cotswolds) and it turns out they're going to Rome! We went to Rome once, and what we mainly remember about it is that someone told us that Vatican City was the smallest country in the world but it was not a good idea to walk round the entire border of it in a day wearing new Primark sandals. The acts seem to be having a laugh though with lots of pizza and ice cream.20:10OH COME ON GUYS, WE LIKE THE NICE CLOTHES BUT WE'RE TEN MINUTES IN AND LITERALLY NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET.20:08The styling of the Overs' is on point and they all look great. We mean, you all know how we feel about BUPSI, but the others are looking great and suave too. It appears Jennifer has borrowed Monica's earrings. Simon, is obviously, wearing normal Simon Cowell clothes.20:07Nick admits that he feels excited but \"really really sick\" which endears him to us a bit. Rita's in some kind of red pleather number which is very On Brand and she looks great. We can't quite tell, but we think Monica 'Earrings' Michael might not be wearing earrings. We're shocked and confused.20:05We're live in the studio and it's not the same with a new voiceover person. We're horrendously disappointed. Caroline and Olly look great in a dress and a rollneck jumper respectively. All of the contestants are sat on the stage awkwardly and are joined one by one by their mentors. Cheryl's an interesting kind of tuxedo jacket and trousers with coiffed shoulder length hair and looks a bit like some kind of political candidate.20:00IT ALL BEGAN AT THE ARENAS. THEY BATTLED AT BOOTCAMP. THEY SURVIVED THE 6 CHAIR CHALLENGE. There was a lot of Hunger Games style melodrama. But they made it. They're here. They got a free holiday. Who will too, make it to live shows?19:58We have absolutely no idea what format this show is going to take, by the way, so bear with us. We're interested to see how well the live bits integrate with the pre-recorded and how that's going to work. And maybe we'll finally get to see how the endless charisma of Nick Grimshaw translates onto live television.19:56WE ARE SO EXCITED.We survived three weeks of Six Chair Challenges. We've earned a double bill weekend of Judge Houses and live decisions. #xfactor— Ryan Love (@RyanJL) October 24, 201519:49How about we think about the tale-as-old-as-time concept of Judges Houses Mates? We remember the glory days, when Simon would get Sinitta round, and Louis would ring up Shane off Westlife. You would believe that these people are friends. Whereas we can't help but wonder on how many occasions Cheryl and Jess Glynne have met.19:45Let's take a minute to think about the fact that Nick's Judges House is in the Cotswolds. Imagine being an X Factor contestant. Imagine being, for example, Josh Daniel, or Che Chesterman, or maybe Ben Clark. Let's go with Ben Clark. Imagine being Ben Clark, a guitary, gravelly sort, and KNOWING that your guitary, gravelly mates are going to rinse you for the rest of your life if you audition for the X Factor. Imagine deciding to do it anyway. Imagine getting through auditions, and then Boot Camp, and then the Six Chair Challenge, and then getting to the final 6 of the boys category. Imagine finding out that after one of your fellow contestants dropped out, someone who Simon Cowell explicitly thinks is an arsehole will be replacing him. You've come all this way. You've been through a lot of stress. But at least it's finally time for a free holiday. Where will you be going, you wonder? What kind of paradise? Ah, Rita's taking the girls to LA! The boys category's destination must be good. Simon's off to the South of France and Cheryl's going to Rome. You speculate wildly about where you might end up. Barbados? Fiji? The world is your oyster! And then you end up in the Cotswolds. IMAGINE.19:33Good evening, everyone! To quote the now departed Dermot, your Saturday night starts right here. Just half an hour to go until the Judges Houses' stage begins and we cannot WAIT to comment on everyone's patio heaters. We don't know too much about what's going on this evening, but we do know that for a Judges Houses' first some parts are going to be live. It will be interesting to see how that pans out... Want to be on The X Factor, but without Simon Cowell grimacing at you? The Bopheads app gives you the chance to appear in that funny bit in the ad breaks, all thanks to those clever people at TalkTalk.
