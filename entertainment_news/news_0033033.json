It was for me to privately understand what we were exploring.” Ben Foster as Lance Armstrong in The Program (Studiocanal) \nBen, who stars opposite Chris O’Dowd as sports journalist David Walsh in Stephen Frears’s biopic, said he tried to get in contact with Lance. \n“I reached out through someone on our set, who was friends with him, and at the time, he wasn’t interested in talking to me. And I don’t blame the man at all.” \nBen said he didn’t know much about the cyclist before he signed on for the role. \n“I never followed cycling. He wasn’t somebody that I paid a lot of attention to so there’s a lot to learn. And the more you learn about a subject, the more complicated it becomes,” he admitted. \n“I joke that I like research much more than making movies. I enjoy being a student of a subject so I could keep studying this for a very long time. That said, I’m glad to be away with it.” \nFor Ben, the subject of Lance is endlessly absorbing.

What’s fascinating is how intricate his story really is, if we steer the conversation away from, ‘he’s a good guy/he’s a bad guy’, and, ‘he’s a liar and cheat’. \n“He raised half a billion dollars for cancer research and awareness, and he ruined people’s careers who threatened this foundation. He lied to protect it at a time when everybody was lying and doping. It wasn’t that he was doing anything different, it’s just that he was doing it better.” Share article \nThe Program is in UK cinemas now.
