(PRWEB) October 02, 2015\nWhen author Steven Bundy’s children were about to graduate from high school and college, he gave them a book of idioms, thoughts and sayings he had come up with over the years.

He finally shares it to the world with the publication of “ Bundyisms ” (published by iUniverse).\nThis inspirational, coffee table book is full of idioms , quips, humor and Christian principles that readers can ponder and consider. The content ranges throughout various aspects of the author’s life, from bathrooms to bitterness. This collection gives insights to a variety of topics, including soda pop, godly wisdom and indifference. Bundy comments on each saying, provoking further thought.\nAn excerpt from the book:\n“A person who offers words of kindness without acts of kindness is like a barber shaving you with a bladeless razor. It feels good when it’s happening, but when it’s over you still need a shave.”\nA fun and motivational read, “Bundyisms” offers provocative sayings that will spark the flame of readers’ thought and send them to contemplate and reflect about life .\n“Bundyisms”\nBy Steven Bundy\nSoftcover | 5x8in | 236 pages | ISBN 9781491773222\nE-Book | 236 pages | ISBN 9781491774724\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nSteve Bundy is a retired pastor and human resources executive.
