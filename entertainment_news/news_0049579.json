It is no longer enough to simply raise our voices, march against corruption, demonstrate against service delivery, reversing all the gains that have been worked hard for by breaking, vandalizing property etc.\nThe ruling party has made itself immune to all these actions, they are stubborn and arrogant, they do not want to listen.\nFellow citizens, we also have to wake up, move out of our comfort zones. For those of us living comfortably because we have stable jobs, being able to afford a comfortable living or benefiting from this evil corruption.\nThe bigger picture is looking beyond our comfort zones so that all citizens of this beautiful country of ours rich and poor, can benefit from what this country has to offer.\n Just think of what the money wasted through corruption can achieve for this country if utilized efficiently. Among other things, this can spell the end to students studying under trees, students not getting reading material, service delivery protests, paying unnecessary toll fees, unemployment and even lessen our income tax rate.\nPeople, lets demand from the government a full account of how our money is spent and we have to expect a very high ROI from this tax we are paying. If expenditures cannot be explained, why should we be continuing to pay the taxes at the current rate?\nWe have to hit them where it hurts. it is hitting us as citizens, it must also hit them in their pockets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:07:41.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
