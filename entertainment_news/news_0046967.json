Photo: Supplied\nMy love affair with turntables continues. Playing records is different to every other music-listening experience out there. If you haven't done it for a while, do it! Invest in some equipment and buy your favourite artists' records. Independent record shops are popping up like man buns around the place, and even JB Hi-Fi has a growing selection.\nA basic record-listening set-up like I used to review these turntables doesn't need to cost a lot – the Polk bookshelf speakers are $549 and the Rotel RA-1- Integrated Amplifier is $599. Add a turntable and you'll be grooving.\nThe Audio-Technica has a start-stop button, but when you turn the Pro-Ject's power on it launches straight on in.\nThe Pro-Ject RPM 1 Carbon with 2M Red. Photo: Supplied\nThe tracking on both turntables is excellent, completely overlooking the scratches on my records that other, cheaper, turntables don't.\nAdvertisement The Audio-Technica has a USB, so you can connect it to your computer and transfer songs Though most records sold today come with digital download codes, or CD versions, some don't, making this useful.\nAnother difference is that the Audio-Technica is direct drive and the Pro-Ject has a belt drive.\nTHE VERDICT\nI can't fault the Pro-Ject for design and sound. However the Audio-Technica's dust cover and USB recording opportunities make it a more practical machine. On this one, however, I'd prefer the non-practical.\nPro-Ject RPM 1 Carbon with 2M Red\nRRP $699\nDespite a snake-like tonearm​ (it really looks reptilian), this is a spunky unit. You'll be wanting to position it in your home so you can take in the full view of the three reverse cone feet as well as the belt, which sits nicely in the centre. Its sound? Perfect.\nAudio-Technica LP120-USB\nRRP $599\nThe biggest challenge in operating this turntable is unravelling it from its packaging.\nOnce that's done, it's a simple case of following the easy (turntable-shaped) instructions. Maybe not as much depth to the sound as the Pro-Ject, but excellent clarity. It does have a dust cover and can play in reverse (for those hidden lyrics).\nCHECK THIS OUT\nIf you think the Audio-Technica turntable looks familiar, you might be thinking of the Technics turntable. Panasonic killed off the SL1200 back in 2010, but yep, vinyl is back. September's IFI (Europe's biggest consumer electronics trade show) had a new Technics turntable prototype, slated for a 2016 release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:27:00.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
