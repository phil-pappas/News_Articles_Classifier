Borkman has worked on many design projects and has been a consultant for a number of large-scale projects including a public sculpture for the artist Martin Puryear. \nRockland — The Apprenticeshop, 655 Main St., will offer two metalworking workshops this fall. Operating since 1972, The Apprenticeshop is a nonprofit center for traditional wooden boatbuilding and seamanship in Rockland’s North End. \nErica Moody will instruct a brazing workshop on custom pintles and gudgeons Monday through Friday, Oct. 26 through 30, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. This workshop will be both an overview and a hands-on exploration of basic soldering and brazing for small custom metal marine hardware in bronze. In making pintle and gudgeons for small-scale wooden boats, the class will cover cutting, drilling, bending, silver brazing, riveting and finishing bronze. Cost is $495. \nMoody is the founder of Magma Metalworks in Beverly, Mass., and has worked as a professional metal fabricator since 1994. Her work is featured in the July/August 2015 issue of WoodenBoat Magazine. \nDoug Borkman of the Rhode Island School of Design will instruct a three-day workshop in bronze casting Friday through Sunday, Nov. 6 through 8. Borkman teaches wood and metal shop practice in the RISD BFA and MFA Sculpture programs and previously taught at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. \nOn the first day of this workshop, participants will work with Apprenticeshop staff to build a small wooden cleat. On the second and final days, they will work with Borkman to cast that same cleat in bronze. Cost is $375 plus a $50 materials fee. \nClass size for both workshops is limited; interested participants are encouraged to register early.
