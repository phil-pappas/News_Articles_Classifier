Both the Hindu outfits have made a statement with their acts, that they will not allow any peace to prevail, with the friendly nation, one touching the Pakistan issue and the second one opposing the Kashmiri separatist leader to organise a press conference. \nIn the first incident, the Shiv Sainiks barged into the office of BCCI chairman Shashank Manohar for organising a meeting with PCB chief Shahryar Khan in which a possible talk on the India-Pakistan cricket match was to take place, while in the second one Hindu Sena activists threw black ink on J&K independent MLA Engineer Rashid. Now we ask the question here is how fair was it to defame the nation in the name of ultra-nationalism? (ALSO READ: Fringe is the new mainstream. Take it or leave it ) \nThe former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah shown his surprise saying that this is not the country he grew in. He said, “Its a series of attacks which suggests that there is less and less space for moderate thought. There was a lot more respect for the fact that India is an assimilation of religions and cultures. This is not the India that J&K acceded to, this is not the India I grew up in. There was a lot more tolerance, acceptability.” \nA victim of ink attack on himself and that too by the Shiv Sena for organising the book launch of former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid M Kasuri, Sudheendra Kulkarni said that this is not the way patriotism should be shown. Speaking to the media, he said, “It has once again sent a message to rest of world that Mumbai and Maharashtra are becoming more intolerant. Showing patriotism by doing these things is not the right thing. These things should not be allowed to happen.” (ALSO READ: Arrested Shiv Sainiks released for Rs 2,000 each; Is Mumbai Police succumbing to political pressure? ) \nCondemning the attacks and the hooliganism by the right wing, Congress and PDP too condemned the attack and said that what Shiv Sena had done on Monday would bring shame to the country. Now, with the criticism coming from all around, the question remains, will this bullshit end? Will this type of bringing shame to the country country? Will Shiv Sena and other Hindu outfit stop spreading hatred in the name of religion and ultra-nationalist approach? We all are waiting. \nModified Date: October 19, 2015 10:59 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:44.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
