I could've had a stroke.\" \nGomez said that her feeling that she's under constant scrutiny was part of why she's stayed mum about her condition until now. \"I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're a--holes,\" she said of the paparazzi and gossip magazines. \"I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\" \nPhotos: Lady Gaga is pretty in pink, Elisabeth Moss goes red and more red carpet looks \nShe also credited Taylor Swift with helping her be comfortable in her own skin again after Internet trolls and critics chimed in on her appearance. \"Taylor makes me feel empowered, like I can trust new people,\" she said. \"The way she cares about women is so adamant. It's pulling me out of my shell.\" View the original article on TVGuide.com *DISCLAIMER* : The information contained in or provided through this site section is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional advice.
