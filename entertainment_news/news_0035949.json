He arranged meetings in Atlantic City, New York City and Denver where he abused her, her attorney George Kontos said.\nCosby paid for Hill's education at Temple University and Spelman College, but she later decided to end contact with him and he stopped making the payments, Kontos said.\nHill stayed silent about her experiences until November 2014, when she gave an interview to a local Pittsburgh TV station after becoming emboldened by other women who had come forward, according to Kontos.\nCosby's representatives responded by depicting Hill as a liar and an extortionist who was out for money, Kontos said.\n\"We intend to prove that those claims were false and that they were meant to intimidate her and that they caused her much emotional distress and harm,\" Kontos told the news conference.\nHill cannot bring a sexual assault claim because the statute of limitations has expired, Kontos said.\nBut she said she hoped the defamation lawsuit would be \"one more step towards seeking justice for what happened to me and in holding Bill Cosby accountable for the false allegations that he's made against me.\"\nCosby, 78, could not immediately be reached for comment. His lawyers have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by the comedian and he has never been criminally charged over the allegations made his dozens of accusers.\n(Reporting by Suzannah Gonzales; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Eric Beech)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-16T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:58:04.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
