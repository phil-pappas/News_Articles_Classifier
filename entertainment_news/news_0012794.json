Georgians dodged a big soggy bullet last week when a deluge described as a 1,000-year storm missed the state and hit South Carolina between the eyes.\nAt least 11 people have died as a result of the floodwaters, with more than 500 roads still closed to traffic statewide and 26,000 South Carolinians without power. And as awful as it was, it could have been worse.\nIn the meantime, Georgia should lend a hand to South Carolina to help that state recover. As bad as conditions there are now, things could get worse in the Lowcounty as massive quantities of floodwater make their way to the coast. There but for the grace of God, go us.\nThe Palmetto State is still drying out and repairing damaged roads, bridges and earthen dams in a disaster that exposed the weaknesses in the state’s transportation infrastructure. While Georgians are lucky this massive storm system passed them by, this catastrophe offers lessons. The biggest is this: state and local transportation officials must redouble efforts to upgrade unsafe bridges and crumbling roads and to clean up drainage ditches and canals on this side of the state line.\nLocal governments often fail to adequately maintain drainage systems, letting ditches get clogged and overgrown with weeds. When floodwater doesn’t drain and floods roads and neighborhoods, people scratch their heads and wonder why. It’s really no mystery.\nFortunately for South Carolina, many of the state’s residents, leaders and emergency workers responded with calmness and bravery to the historic floods. Still, the event that S.C. Gov. Nikki Haley described as the kind of storm that hits only once every 1,000 years caught South Carolina with its pants down, closing major highways, including a long stretch of Interstate 95 and many roads in and around Columbia. It was something you’d expect in a third world country, not so close to home. But it wasn’t totally unexpected.\nSouth Carolina officials have long been reluctant to make the hard political decisions necessary to come up with the money to repair roads and bridges. Now, the state faces hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars’ worth of additional expenses to fix or replace key places of its devastated infrastructure. And they can’t expect Uncle Sam to come to the rescue with a blank check. While the federal government can be expected to cover some of the costs, even that could be a political problem.\nIf Congress decides to consider a special relief bill, South Carolina could face a kind of payback. Five of the state’s six U.S. House members and both U.S. senators voted against an aid package for Northeastern states after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\nIt likely will take weeks or months to document the full extent of the damage and to find out how much federal aid is coming South Carolina’s way. That aid likely will come with requirements that bridges and dams be built to stronger, more expensive standards. So the Republican-controlled state’s leaders — who recently shot down a business-backed effort to get an extra $400 million a year for roads by raising some taxes and lowering others — likely will have to grit their teeth and come up with matching funds.\nAs of Wednesday, about 260 roads and bridges were closed, many of them washed out, according to the S.C. Department of Transportation. Common problems include gaping holes where water washed out the support underneath bridges and roads, leaving them subject to collapse, a hidden danger motorists would never spot on their own. In the meantime, barricades are expected to block many roads for a long while.\nLike Georgia, South Carolina depends almost entirely on its gas tax to fund highway maintenance, and it hasn’t raised its gas tax since 1987. Even before the floods, 20 percent of the state’s 8,300 bridges were rated structurally deficient or structurally obsolete, and a road advocacy group made up of business leaders estimated it would take $500 million extra a year just to patch the pothole-dotted roads that shake vehicles as they drive over them.\nThe state periodically closed deteriorated bridges until they could be repaired, and even heading down interstates and major highways could rattle cars violently. Over the past several years, the state has paid tens of millions of dollars to settle claims over vehicles damaged by potholes or poorly maintained roads.\nSouth Carolina’s poor spending may have made the problems from the flood even worse, the rushing water a final blow against crumbling structures, some engineering experts have said.\nState officials reported at least 11 small dams have failed in a state where some 200 dams are considered high-hazard, meaning they could significantly threaten life and property if breached. The state spends less than $200,000 a year on dam safety, which is ridiculously low.\nDrinking water supplies, too, have gone wanting. Some customers have sued the state’s capital and largest city, Columbia, for diverting water system profits to pay for economic development projects even though the Environmental Protection Agency had ordered $700 million in fixes to the aging system. That decision was terribly short-sighted, as many residents in and around Columbia now have to boil their water before they use it.\nHaley made South Carolina a promise Tuesday: “We’re not going to stop until we get everything back up and fixed again,” she said.\nThat’s big talk, but she wouldn’t get into where the money will come from.\nThat’s because she doesn’t know, and it’s foolish to make a promise you can’t keep.\nGeorgians can’t afford to be smug. Earlier this year state lawmakers here replaced Georgia’s sales tax on gasoline with a more expensive excise tax that is expected to generate about $900 million annually for transportation project. In light of the disaster that hit South Carolina, Georgia lawmakers who worked on this measure and voted for it in the face of political opposition look like geniuses. The Georgia Department of Transportation must use part of this windfall to shore up crumbling bridges and roads. Deferring maintenance is foolish and always comes at a high price in the end. Just look at South Carolina as an example. The next thousand year storm might land in Georgia’s lap. That’s something Georgia’s leaders can’t control. But they can spend tax dollars wisely and repair the state’s infrastructure so what happened to our neighbors is less likely to happen here. Local and state leaders also must make mitigating the effects of future floods a top priority for every new development, road or infrastructure project in Georgia.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:34:20.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
