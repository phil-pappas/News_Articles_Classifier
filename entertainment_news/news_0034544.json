Not since, other than maybe to periodically bump into each other,” Redford, 79, began at the Crosby Street Hotel.\n“So I called and asked if there was anything he wanted to tell me. He said it was about loyalty, ‘That’s what it was really about Bob.’\n“His loyalty to Mary, his loyalty to his boss. Their loyalty to their boss. So that was enough for me to start.”\nDoes Redford see “Truth” as a bookend to his 1976 Oscar-winning classic “All the President’s Men” — albeit one with a less-happy ending?\n“There is a difference,” he answered. “It has to do with the boss. In ‘All the President’s Men’ you had the same thing: Two characters — just like you have Cate and myself — going against the odds trying to get to the truth.\n“In ‘President’s Men’ they had the support of their paper and the editor. Mary and Dan ultimately did not have the support of their bosses, and I think that that is the big difference.\n“Because when they didn’t have that support, they were kind of left alone out there to be skewered.\n“And to me both films share the same perspective: It’s all about hard work. ‘President’s Men’ was really about the hard work that these guys did; the work became the emotional point to tell their story about the work they did.\n“With Mary and Dan, it was about the work they were trying to do and to get the work done. That’s what they have in common.”\n( “Truth” opens Friday.)\n— cinesteve@hotmail.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Redford%E2%80%99s+respect+for+Dan+Rather+not+exactly+%E2%80%A8breaking+news"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:33:11.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
