Brittney has appeared on TV, radio and billboards.\nShe recently published “The Little Laughing Yogini” and shows no signs of being winded. Discover this thoughtful yogi’s take on mindfulness.\nFrom a holistic standpoint, how can we use yoga to bring about a more mindful attitude?\nYoga is key to mindfulness. When I began in 1998, I noticed the more I practiced, the less I was worried about wearing the crown of gossip. When we practice yoga we take time to tune in to our body. How does this pose make me feel? Am I tight there? Loose here? How is my breathing? Wow! Am I breathing? We dive into our mind on a physical level as opposed to just sitting with our thoughts.\nAnother form of yoga I use to reconnect to my inner child is known as Laughter Yoga. In a world where stress is worn like a pair of Jimmy Choos, Laughter Yoga helps us breathe deeper. We utilize our imagination with each exercise based on playing pretend. In a group, we connect through eye contact and without conversation. This reaches down to a soul level of connection. Eye contact itself is a powerful tool. These days, our fingers do so much of the walking in terms of communication. Laughter Yoga brings awareness back into our lives. My book, “The Little Laughing Yogini” is my foray into bringing Laughter Yoga to children.\nWhat’s your take on all these yoga posts on social media?\nAt first, they were my enemy. As a new yoga-prenuer in 2012, I was inspired and then I was tired. I began to obsess over the fact that I had to be like them or else I wouldn’t “make it”. There is currently a “celebrity-yoga” phase occurring. I longed for the days that I practiced yoga for fun and not competition. This lit a fire in my belly to take action and use social media as a tool to appreciate where others are in their journey. In others, I am able to see my own reflection.\nAs a yoga instructor and massage therapist, how do you aid clients with their body image?\nI have clients utter the saddest of things on the table. “Rub out my cellulite” or “Oops! I didn’t shave.” These types of comments created compassion within me.\nWhen a person is on the table, they are vulnerable and I am in charge. I can make them feel completely uncomfortable or at ease with a few words. I am conscientious of what I say in these moments and do my best to allow them to feel at ease, with not only me but also themselves.\nBody image has been my whole life as a girl and then a woman with a massive scar down my chest. As a teen, I dealt with scars from open-heart surgery as a baby. (This scar tissue will lock up every so often if I don’t do yoga.) I might not have the awareness of my body that I currently enjoy if it wasn’t for yoga.\nI have been told by others I must have a “yoga body” to make it in the yoga world. “You want to inspire others to look like you,” I have heard. I am here to say, “No! I do not want others to look like me, I want others to be happy.” I want them to feel like they can do anything regardless of their power suit. We have this amazing body, but we must flex our mind to keep it pliable like a child’s. Being comfortable and appreciative of our body is the first step to becoming who we want to be in this world.\nWhat led you to blend your yoga style with Reiki and how has it surprised you so far?\nI love all things unique. I saw opportunity for the public to experience something healing, fresh, and, of course, your energy! Participating in this class with you is unlike anything I have ever done and I was honored that you came to me with the collaborative idea. I am excited to see it is becoming more known and that we are able to give it to the public for free! The experiences people have during the class are tremendous, often I see people look and seem as if they feel lighter when they leave. This is always a favorite experience of mine!\nWe all have that inner, abusive demon. I’ll call yours “Twittney.” How do you diffuse Twittney with yoga?\nGiving myself the simple opportunity to breathe and move. It amazes me how often I sit in front of a computer and realize I am not truly breathing. An hour goes by and I am short of breath! This is one of the main causes of stress, the inability to breath and the lack of exercise. Yoga helps tame “Twittney” by offering me a moment to be in my body and out of my head. This grounds and replenishes me to understand that, yes, indeed all is as it should be and all is well!\nChris (Sutty) Suddeth enjoys his Mr. Mom status as a stay-at-home father to his daughter, Emma Belle.
