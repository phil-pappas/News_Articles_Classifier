He says the other inmate, Veronica Lewis, used a food chute into Quaid's cell. \nThe Quaids were arrested Friday in Vermont as they tried to enter the U.S. from Quebec. They're being held on bail on charges they left the country five years ago after being accused of vandalism in California. \nLewis is charged with shooting a firearms instructor in the face in June. A phone message and email to her public defender weren't immediately returned Tuesday. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:39:13.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
