Actually that was many a moment, but OK; another standout (read: disturbing) scene came during the foursome sex scene Matt's and Lady Gaga's characters had with two unfortunate hotties. Spoiler alert: the hotties died.\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail MTV spoke with Chasty Ballasteros, the actress playing Matt's primary sexual ​partner , and it turns out the scene — which took three days of filming — was a raucous fun time. Ballasteros said she had no idea her role would be such a big deal, as her audition was only for \"a swing situation\" with \"implied nudity.\" \"Normally we get the whole script to read,\" she said of her acting gigs,\" but [for Hotel ] only got our scenes in a sealed envelope, and literally did not read it until we got fitted for our clothes.\" And I mean, what was even the point of a clothes fitting?!\nMore From Cosmopolitan Ryan Murphy was a very hands-on director, apparently — \"he was literally a composer,\" Ballesteros said, with all the sexual choreography mapped out in his head. Lady Gaga was \"so confident,\" on set, Ballasteros added, describing Matt also as \"a pro,\" which is particularly great because it works as an accolade regarding his acting and his vigorous hip thrusts (although we all knew the latter were legit having seen Magic Mike ). \"And in between takes, we're set in that scene and we're all bloody and stuff, and we just sat there naked, just chatting,\" she reminisced — specifically, they chatted about \"cats, and the business, things we had for lunch.\" How lovely.\nFor more insight on the scene, and how all the blood packs burst (it's gnarly, as you'd expect), click through to MTV.com for the interview in full.\nFollow Alex on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://www.mtv.com/news/2342804/american-horror-story-hotel-checking-in-foursome/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444318657-tumblr-nvwj4fmnfu1rvrh68o1-540.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x215/gallery-1444318657-tumblr-nvwj4fmnfu1rvrh68o1-540.gif", "http://twitter.com/maybealexislost", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/placeholder_1444318657-tumblr-nvwj4fmnfu1rvrh68o1-540.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x215/placeholder_gallery-1444318657-tumblr-nvwj4fmnfu1rvrh68o1-540.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:22:32.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
