Filmmaker Slávek Horák poses that question in his debut feature, Home Care, filmed on location around his birthplace in eastern Czech Republic. \nIt’s a lovingly shot movie that shows off all the skills Horák picked up during two decades of making commercials in Europe, some for high-profile clients like Lexus. When he decided to turn his attention to fiction, he travelled back to his hometown of Zlin to think — only to be regaled each day with tales from his mother as she returned from her job as a home care nurse. \n“I was thinking of any lofty topic worthy of my ambition to make my first feature,” said Horák, 40, in a phone interview from his office in Prague. “But I had no quiet time because my mother is very talkative. I came to realize that her story was much more interesting than anything I was coming up with.” \nThe result is a bittersweet comic tale surrounding Vlasta (a role that won Alena Mihulová a best actress award from Czech film-festival goers) who must come to terms with her own frailty. \nThe strict traditional male-female roles of small-town life are laid bare each time Vlasta’s husband, played by celebrated Czech comic and actor Boleslav Polívka, enters a scene. He putters around the vineyard and his workshop, never learning how to turn on the washing machine or cook a meal. Making and consuming slivovitz — homemade plum brandy — is his most-prized skill. \n“It’s a very common feature for Czech males of that generation. They have a good heart, but they never show it. It’s not masculine to be emotional ... so they hide behind jokes and a lighthearted attitude. It’s like a protective shell,” says Horák. \n“They grew up in Communist Czechoslovakia and they didn’t have any role models other than their fathers who were equally shut in. I think the regime had a lot to do with it. Once you presented your true feelings, you were in trouble.” \nVlasta tries to branch out with the help of her new, more unconventional, friend Mlada (Tatiana Vilhelmová), a dance instructor and follower of New Age teachings who challenges her to widen her outlook. \nMuch of the film was shot in the home and garden of Horák’s parents without the help of a set designer, a purposeful decision the director made to follow the tradition of stripped-down Dogme filmmaking. The resulting scenes speak of great affection for less sophisticated, more innocent lives. \n“It’s also a tribute to the character of my mum. Her good heart is often abused by other people. I wanted to show that naiveté — this good heart — is one of the most valuable characteristics you can have.” \nThe main characters illustrate the divergence of village life in Moravia from Prague’s urban norms each morning when they toast each other with wake-up shots of slivovitz while still in their pyjamas. \n“These days, with this obsession with a healthy lifestyle, this little anachronism with the slivovitz makes me laugh every time I encounter it,” says Horák. “It’s very particular to this region. It’s a matter of honour to make so much slivovitz every year that it lasts until the next season.” \nHome Care was recently chosen as the Czech Republic’s entry into the running for Best Foreign Film at the next Academy Awards. \nVIFF shines a spotlight on films about health \nJames White \nOct. 9 | SFU Woodward’s \nJobless, drugged-out James White (Christopher Abbott, who plays Charlie in HBO’s Girls) has to pull himself together when his mother (Cynthia Nixon of Sex and the City fame) is diagnosed a second time with cancer. \nIt follows James through New York — from loud nightclubs to tony apartments and the streets between them — while telling the story of the connection between mother and son. \nDirector Josh Mond has already won several film festival awards this year for his directorial debut, to be released in theatres in November. \nAlice Cares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:37:59.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
