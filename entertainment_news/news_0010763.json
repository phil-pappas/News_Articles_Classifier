The Bachelorette Sam Frost and winner Sasha Mielczarek pictured in New Zealand. Channel 10 Cars For Sale \nSAM Frost believes she has found her Mr Right in Sasha Mielczarek. \nThe lovebirds were finally able to talk openly about their feelings for one another in tonight's Bachelorette grand final, which saw Frost choose Mielczarek over Brisbane soccer player and real estate agent Michael Turnbull. \nAt one point Frost was lost for words as she prepared to finally tell Mielczarek, 30, that she loved him. \nLast year the 26-year-old went through a public breakup with The Bachelor Blake Garvey and hoped to find love by going on The Bachelorette. \n\"I was so scared to put my heart out there again, and I had moments where I just thought I was going to be one of those people who never found the right person for them,\" Frost said. \n\"I never could understand why I had been hurt so much or why my relationships weren't working out, and then I met you and I realised that I have been waiting my whole life to meet you. \n\"I just never thought I was going to find love Sash, and I love you so much.\" Sam Frost and Sasha Mielczarek pictured during their final date on the show on New Zealand's North Island. Channel 10 \nRunner-up Turnbull handled his elimination gracefully. Frost thanked him for being so brave to go on the show. \n\"You've got to trust in your instinct,\" he said. \n\"Someone's got to go home; that's how this works.\" \nTonight's grand final saw Frost go on two final dates with Mielczarek and Turnbull on New Zealand's North Island. \nShe also introduced the men to her brothers and older sister Kristine, who openly asked them if they were on the show to find fame. \n\"I've been fooled before and I don't' want to be fooled again,\" she told Turnbull. \n\"You do seem too perfect. \n\"Blake said all the right thingsâ€¦ and we ended up with egg on our faces.\" \nBoth men declared their love for Frost in their final one-on-one time with her. Her tearful reaction to eventual winner Mielczarek said it all. \nThe show occupied five of the top 10 trending topics on Twitter tonight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:29:06.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
