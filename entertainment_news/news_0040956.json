And thus, it prompted her in writing “ Echoes of My Clan- A Gypsy’s Story ” (published by Xlibris). This novel tells the story of Carlota, a young, zealous Gypsy girl with an indomitable spirit who is forced to learn to live outside her people. Her free spirit is reflected and defined in the way she lives her life. She does not accept defeat and nothing can stop her while she takes life head-on. Her savoring and mesmerizing passage into womanhood is filled with passion, sorrow, humor, intrigue, trials, triumph and love.\nDr. Alberto Moreno Restrepo, author of “Una Mujer Llamada Anayansi” says:\n“With her novel “Echoes of My Clan,” Rocio Vargas Herrera has been able to clarify many of the doubts regarding the sentiments of the Gypsies and their way of thinking. Her lithe, articulate, and easy reading takes us by the hand through the experiences and sufferings of the main character: first as a child, who must live in the world of the whites or non-gypsy, and as an adult, during the terrifying days of the Second World War , including the repressive Franco era in Spain. Her indomitable character and sense of responsibility shape her way and catches us from the beginning. It’s an interesting novel, dynamic, entertaining, and a worthwhile read.”\nThrough the publication of “Echoes of My Clan,” the author hopes readers will realize that with love of family, respect for elders and compassion for one’s fellow man, everyone will be able to confront anything life gives them. This book will soon be available in Spanish format.\n“Echoes of My Clan: A Gypsy’s Story”\nBy Rocio Vargas Herrera\nHardcover | 6 x 9in | 330 pages | ISBN 9781503586178\nSoftcover | 6 x 9in | 330 pages | ISBN 9781503592391\nE-Book | 330 pages | ISBN 9781503586185\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nRocio Vargas Herrera was born of a Calo (Gypsy) father and a Gacho (non-Gypsy) mother in the Republic of Panama and currently lives in the United States.
