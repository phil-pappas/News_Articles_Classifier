Daniel Craig Is SO Done With James Bond - \"I'd Rather Slash My Wrists\" Daniel Craig James Bond \nRumours have been abounding in the last year that Idris Elba or Damian Lewis will be replacing Craig as 007 after 'Spectre'. \nMuch has been made of the rumour that Spectre will be the last James Bond film to feature Daniel Craig , and now there’s even more evidence to support that, with the actor himself saying that he’d “rather slash his wrists” than play 007 again. \nThe 47 year old has not confirmed whether he’ll be fulfilling his lucrative contract to shoot one more Bond film after Spectre or passing the prestigious role onto somebody else. Though he recently gave an interview to The Independent saying he’ll continue to play the iconic part “as long as he’s physically able”, it seems as though his attitude towards Bond is volatile. Daniel Craig REALLY doesn't want to do another Bond film \n“I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists [than make another Bond film]. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done, all I want to do is move on,” the actor told Time Out magazine . However, he did admit that he could be persuaded back, but it would “only be for the money”. \nMore: Daniel Craig isn’t interested in who succeeds him as James Bond \nIt’s difficult to imagine that Craig could get paid significantly more than he is already. According to The Sun, he’s in line to earn a staggering £39 million from Spectre alone – which is more than the combined earnings of all the other actors to occupy the role of 007 put together. \nWhat does seem certain is that Craig will, at the very least, take a significant break from the role, which keeps him locked in a gruelling gym regime to maintain his physique. He plans to enjoy family life “for at least a year or two - I just don’t want to think about it. I don’t know what the next step is, I’ve no idea,” he said. “Not because I’m trying to be cagey. Who the f*** knows? At the moment, we’ve done it. I’m not in discussion with anybody about anything.” \nCraig also greeted the suggestion that he might stay on the production team with a backstage role with ridicule. “Oh Christ no! How f***ing sad would that be? Oh look, it’s Daniel Craig, he’s on set again! No!” \nSpectre is released in cinemas on October 26th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:10:15.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
