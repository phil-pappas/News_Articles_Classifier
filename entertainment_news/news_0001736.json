Shea Legos are the building blocks of an art controversy 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Legos are suddenly political footballs for one of the world's most famous artists.\nSupporters of the legendary dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei have quickly organized a campaign to send him loads of Legos after the Danish company that makes the building block toys refused his bulk order.\nThe company has said it does not want its toys to be used for political purposes, Ai reported on Instagram. He had ordered millions of blocks to create an installation for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia.\n\"I was quite surprised when I found out,\" Ai told New York Times Sinosphere blogger Amy Qin. \"A company that sells pens cannot tell a writer that he or she can't do political writing or romantic writing. It's really none of their business.\"\nNow he has a new problem: How to handle incoming Legos from people all over the world who are responding via the hashtag #legosforweiwei.\nHoustonians may remember Ai's \"Circle of Animals,\" an installation of monumental bronzes representing the signs of the zodiac that was displayed a few years ago at Hermann Park.\nMeanwhile, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, another famous artist's Lego project is getting less serious play. Olafur Eliasson's \"the collectivity project\" contains more than 580,000 white Lego bricks. Museum visitors are invited to build an imaginary cityscape with them. Perhaps they'll be inspired to form something slightly different now?\n\"The collectivity project\" is on view in the lobby of the Caroline Wiess Law Building, 1001 Bissonnet, until Jan. 31. Museum admission is $7.50-$15; free on Thursdays.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/61/22/8852635/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/14/40/67/3280345/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/11/63/17/2569180/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/14/40/67/3280344/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/lego-ai-weiwei-political-donations/?_r=0", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/14/40/67/3280345/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/11/63/17/2569180/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/61/22/8852636/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/61/22/8852635/3/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/legosforweiwei?src=hash", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/61/22/8852636/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/14/40/67/3280344/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:22:22.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
