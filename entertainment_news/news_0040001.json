The grapevine has it that Vidyut Jamwal, who debuted in B’town with Force, the remake of Kaaka Kaaka, will reprise Karthi’s role in the remake. Similarly, there have been speculations doing the rounds about the female lead in the movie. It’s heard that Shruti Haasan is being considered by the makers to be paired opposite Vidyut. Interestingly, Tamannaah, one of Shruti’s counterpart in south, was the heroine in the original version. If everything goes well, Lingusamy will make his directorial debut in Bollywood with the remake of Paiyaa. Both the actresses remain good friends off screen and had acted in Tollywood film Aagadu, albeit not sharing screen space in the movie.
