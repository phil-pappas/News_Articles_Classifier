Anna has been parenting the couple's four children alone as Josh seeks treatment for personal issues, including pornography addiction.\n\"She's good,\" Amy said of her beleaguered relative. \"I talk to her a lot. She's doing good. She's strong. I wouldn't be handling it quite the same way.\"\nJosh admitted to cheating on Anna after it was discovered he had an account on extramarital affair site Ashley Madison in August. The scandal came just three months after he confessed to molesting five girls, including sisters Jill and Jessa Duggar , as a teenager.\n\"They don't speak on a regular basis,\" a source told Hollywood Life of Josh and Anna. \"He's been begging her not to leave him. He says he's determined to change, by the grace of God, and [he's] working hard to get to that place.\"\nAmy married Dillon King in September, and showed her support for Anna at the ceremony. She admitted to being \"furious\" with Josh after he entered rehab, and previously revealed Anna has been seeking comfort in her family.\nAnna and Josh married in 2008, and are parents to four children, including 3-month-old daughter Meredith. The Duggar family came to fame on TLC series 19 Kids & Counting , which was canceled in the wake of Josh's sex abuse revelations.\n  'Law & Order: SVU' will air Duggar-inspired episode Jessa Duggar shares baby bump photo at 36 weeks Anna Duggar 'doing well' following Josh Duggar scandals Jill and Jessa Duggar to star on new TLC specials", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:46:18.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
