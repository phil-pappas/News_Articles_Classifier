Unfortunately, since children today are constantly connected, it's no longer limited to school hours and has become a serious problem with even more detrimental effects for victims, including suicide. Having experienced depression due to bullying first-hand, author Nicola Mar chose to take on the topic in her young adult novel, Santa; .\nInspired by real girls who've committed suicide due to bullying, Santa; aims to educate young people – and adults – about the physical and psychological effects of bullying. Spanning the course of several weeks, Santa; details the physical and emotional deterioration of June, a victim of severe bullying after she survives an attack by her classmates. With no one and nothing to trust but faith, she struggles with the idea that the human spirit may not exist.\nTen percent of all proceeds from the sales of Santa; will be donated to Project Semicolon. A global faith-based non-profit movement, Project Semicolon exists to encourage, love, and inspire those struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts to move forward with their lives.\n\"Bullying has always been present in schools, but recently it seems to have become an epidemic,\" Mar states. \"I wrote this book hoping that people who read it will become more aware of what happens physically and psychologically to teens who are constantly bullied and threatened in school and online. Awareness is the only way we're going to change our society.\"\nFor more information on Santa; , please visit www.nicolamar.com .\nMedia Contact:\nKatie Benesch\n856-489-8654 x323\nEmail\nVideo - http://youtu.be/efqMB6V1Nm8\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273490\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273491\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/october-is-national-bullying-prevention-month---young-adult-novel-explores-the-real-effects-of-bullying-300153733.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nicolamar.com/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151002/273491", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151002/273490", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH18724&Transmission_Id=201510050840PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH18724&DateId=20151005", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273490", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273491", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/october-is-national-bullying-prevention-month---young-adult-novel-explores-the-real-effects-of-bullying-300153733.html", "http://youtu.be/efqMB6V1Nm8", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291605", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqMB6V1Nm8?version=3"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:59:11.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
