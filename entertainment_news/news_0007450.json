The former, a police procedural, has been canceled after six seasons while the latter, an alien drama, won't return after three seasons. \"The success of 'Rookie Blue' is a testament not only to the extremely talented team of Ilana Frank, Tassie Cameron, David Wellington and studio Entertainment One (eOne), but the electrifying cast that has resonated with legions of fans that have followed the show since season 1,\" said Christine Shipton, senior vp and chief creative officer of Shaw Media. \"After six seasons the series reached a natural conclusion, and this season's finale was the perfect wrap up for both our rookies and for fans, especially with the marriage of our favorite couple, Sam and Andy.\" The show stars Missy Peregrym and Ben Bass as young, ambitious cops right out of the Academy. The series premiere was television's top-rated scripted summer debut in 2010 with 1.9 million. The series finale, aired on September 3, drew 3.68 million viewers. Meanwhile, \"Defiance\" had a case of ratings struggle. The series starring Julie Benz and Grant Bowler premiered in 2013 in tandem with an online multiplayer video game from Trion Worlds! After a welcoming 2.73 million viewers, the series failed to pick up the pace and ended its third season this August with 1.17 million viewers. \" 'Defiance' was a truly groundbreaking series, delivering an immersive, cross-platform experience that transcended the television screen in a way that viewers had never seen before,\" Syfy said in a statement. \"We are incredibly proud of the work of the extraordinary cast, writers, artists and designers - and especially showrunner Kevin Murphy - who together brought the rich world of 'Defiance' to life over its three season arc.\" Murphy said, \"I got to collaborate with a group of stunning artists operating at the top of their game, and together we built a world. Because of that, there is no room for anything other than joy in my heart.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:20:13.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
