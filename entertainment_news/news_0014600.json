And the question we mull this afternoon is: Why stop now, Jimmy?\nStick around a few more days, or weeks. The weather's still nice. Fall's here. LA's not going anywhere.\nMost popular Best new TV shows, according to viewers 'Billy Elliot the Musical Live': As good as it gets Is 'The Walking Dead' a dying breed? Mets appearing on 'Kimmel' tonight Adele releases 1st song off upcoming album In fact, why not just stay?\nSomething about this week at BAM added a fresh and new element to this late night series, which remains in third place among the big three, and is still -- in a sense -- seeking that unique selling proposition besides the talented host. Not even \"live\" any longer, the title itself is a marketing misnomer, born of an old idea that never really panned out.\nBut this week in Brooklyn offered an alluring hint of something else -- an intriguing idea.\nKimmel was last here in 2012, just as superstorm Sandy blasted the Tri-state area. People had other distractions at the time -- watching Kimmel's run in Brooklyn did not rise to the level of even a diversion.\nThis week was different. We got a close look, and we saw a host re-energized, and a show that seemed to expand with possibilities. Even Kimmel's stature seemed to grow a bit. The guests were good, and from the ones I saw, seemed genuinely grateful and excited to be here.\nA few bits were inspired -- the return of Doc Brown and Marty McFly comes immediately to mind. (A few lines were inspired, too: Doc Brown: \"You mean people are watching this on TV?\" Kimmel: \"People ARE watching us on TV, although in reality, people are watching us on their toilets tomorrow.\")\nGood musical guests, too -- and Jay Z had a nice surprise at Barclays Center.\nThere's something about the Kimmel style -- a serrated edge that can draw blood -- that seems well-suited to the environs of Lafayette and Flatbush Avenue:\nHe seemed to enjoy himself.\nThe audience certainly seemed to enjoy itself.\n@Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Why not a permanent move here then?\nLots of obvious reasons why not, I suppose, leading off with money. Brooklyn is expensive. But then so is the El Capitan Entertainment Centre where the show originates from now.\nBrooklyn is not the center of the entertainment world.\nBut wait, it is ... almost. Brooklyn is very much an important and vital part of that world. At least \"Girls\" says so.\nBrooklyn is hard to get to. Subways, Uber.\nBut ... you're kidding, right? It's easy. There are subways and Uber.\nBrooklyn won't bring audiences.\nBut ... you're still kidding, right? Audiences will turn up at any show -- I assure you. I've seen evidence of this. So have you. What you want are engaged audiences, otherwise referred to as \"fans.\" Kimmel has a lot of fans in this area. Getting to Brooklyn shouldn't be an issue.\nIn fact, there is no good reason not to bring \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" here.\nThe advantages are easy to enumerate:\n1.) Many major films open in New York now, and the publicity tours begin here. Kimmel at the El Capitan is -- in a sense -- third stop on their tours, after \"Tonight Show\" and \"Late Night\" (which by the way has a decidedly more political/issue-oriented guest list under Stephen Colbert, so potential duplication would more likely be with Jimmy Fallon).\n2.) Kimmel is a New York guy. He's a Long Island guy, too. He is of this region, and his style, humor and perspectives are of this area. He may live and work in Los Angeles, but out there, he still seems like a host without a home.\n3.) With Kimmel here, there would be three major late night network shows in New York City. This would truly be the late night TV capital of the world.\n4.) Kimmel in Brooklyn would indeed be a unique show -- with a different vibe, feel, tone, energy. You could feel Brooklyn -- or at least the gentrified parts of Brooklyn -- surge through these shows.\n5.) BAM would be a magnificent venue -- but an impractical one. Clearly, BAM has other priorities besides hosting a late night show every night. \"Kimmel\" simply couldn't originate from here on a long-term basis, or maybe even a short-term one. That's a significant concern, maybe even impediment, but there are other theaters in Brooklyn. How about the Kings Theatre? Another magnificent venue.\nThose are the immediate reasons that come to mind. You may have your own.\nMeanwhile, check out Thursday's interview with Bradley Cooper -- a good one, and reminds me of another opportunity lost.\nMany years ago, Fox aired a series, \"Kitchen Confidential,\" that was raw but funny . The lead actor wasn't a big name at the time, but had just ended a nice run on \"Alias.\"\nThe numbers weren't great. Fox pulled the plug, prematurely.\nThe lead of that show was ... well, you know who.\nSo let's get this done, Jimmy. Move to Brooklyn! Don't pull a Fox and leave this beautiful borough prematurely. Opportunity and ratings await.\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Newsday", "https://twitter.com/Newsday/newsday-staff"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:40:08.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
