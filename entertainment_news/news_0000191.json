Cinque contacted Internet publication Animal New York regarding photos it published in 2014 of the famous artist lying naked on a mattress, Ratter reported . \nCinque requested that the website immediately take down the photos, as \"they disparage Mr. Basquiat and are prurient in nature,\" according to a screenshot of the e-mail on Ratter. \nThe apparently offensive images come from a 2014 exhibition called \"Jean-Michel Basquiat, Reclining Nude,\" which featured a series of black and white photos that Paige Powell, Basquiat's ex-girlfriend, took of the artist in their Upper West Side apartment in the 1980s. \n\"The photographs provide an intimate look into our private lives while we were together in the early 1980s,\" Powell told ArtDaily . \n\"They are at once vulnerable and trusting images of our love and the daily life of Jean-Michel Basquiat.\" \nOutside of the 2014 exhibition, a number of other publications — including The Huffington Post — ran the photos, but apparently Animal New York's publication was the straw that broke the camel's back. \nBucky Turco, who was the owner of Animal New York before the site was shuttered in July, commented about the request for photo removal: \n\"There's a reason why lawyers are lawyers and not art critics. The request to remove the photos is absurd. He has no legal standing. Also, anyone who uses the word 'prurient,' should never be taken seriously,\" he said. \nCinque did not immediately respond to calls for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:48:01.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
