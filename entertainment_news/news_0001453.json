We’re going to do ESPN’s Game Day downtown-style,” he says. \nHough says the decision to add Taste of Gameday came about as organizers were trying to figure out a way to unite the festivities going on at Bearfest Village with Taste of Springfield. \nTaste of Gameday will feature a panel of guests that includes MSU President Clif Smart, MSU alum/football pro Dennis Heim, television legend Ned Reynolds, Art Hains, the voice of the Bears and more. Taste of Gameday will also feature live music from Jonathan Joseph and Soul Society, giveaways and more. \n“It will get things started for a busy day downtown,” Johnston says. “We hope that it will encourage some cross traffic from our events and Bearfest Village. I think there’s enough time for people to enjoy both.” \nWant to go? \n• What: The 9th Annual Taste of Springfield featuring OktoberFest Village and Taste of Gameday \n• When: Saturday; food available 11 a.m.-3 p.m.; beer, 11 a.m.-9 p.m.; live music, 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Taste of Gameday kicks off one hour earlier, at 10 a.m., on Park Central East \n• Where: Downtown Springfield \n• Cost: Free; tickets to sample food are 10 for $10 (each sample requires two or three tickets); beer tickets sold separately \n• Info: www.itsalldowntown.com or 417-831-6200 \n• 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m.: Dart Frog \n• 1:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.: Brookline Station \n• 4-5 p.m.: Cory Jay \n• 5:30-7 p.m.: Justice Adams Band \n• 7:30-9 p.m.: Jesse and the Rips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:33:21.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
