He said people shouldn't assume all pet stores are puppy mills.\nIt is not the pet stores that are puppy mills, they are the places that sell the puppies. It's the farms that breed the puppies that are the problem. I'm so glad that you got a healthy puppy. Many are not because they breed from unhealthy dogs.\nThe animals that suffer are dogs in the puppy mills that make those puppies that you buy in pet stores. In many mills some of the female and male dogs are so neglected. Many live their whole lives in a cage and never touch the grass or ground.\nMany dogs do not get proper vet care or grooming. They never know what it is like to be cared for and loved. Their only purpose is to make puppies. He said \"all dogs deserve a good home.\" They will never know that life.\nI have two dogs that were rescued from a mill. My Lhasa apso was between 1 and 2 when I got her and she had already had had a few litters of puppies. My boxer was 1 year old and she was afraid to walk through doors and could not go up stairs. Many dogs never get past all those fears. I have had mine for over 6 years and they are wonderful companions. I hate to think what their lives would have been like if they had not gotten out of the puppy mill.\nNo one wants to put pet stores out of business, only puppy mills. Do some research about puppy mills!\nSharon Lialios\nArlington Heights\nRelated Article\nDon't assume all pet stores are puppy mills Discuss Small Business Letters to the Editor Arlington Heights Pets and Animals", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:13:11.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
