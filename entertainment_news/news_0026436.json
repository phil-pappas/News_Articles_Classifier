The hopefuls chose a variety of ballads to belt out, everything from Beyonce to Aretha Franklin. But there was one not-so-great song choice. \nBuxom blonde Hannah bounded onto the stage and belted out none other than Let It Go. And no one could quite believe it. \n1. What song are you singing, pet? Oh… \"I'm going to sing Let It Go….\" #XFactor pic.twitter.com/3OyHn39Y2d \n2. Let it Go? You know, that song from that little-known musical. Never heard of that song him my life if I am honest #xfactor #6ChairChallenge \n— Joshua Ritchie (@ritchie_joshua) October 18, 2015 \n3. You’ve probably never heard of it. It’s not really mainstream. Cause we haven't heard \"Let It Go\" enough… #XFactor pic.twitter.com/79AyqkPWwl \n— Jonathan Cheetham (@Jontroid) October 18, 2015 \n4. We’re sure we’ve heard that rendition somewhere else before… That was like when I sing Let It Go when I'm pissed. Out of time, and in my pyjamas. #XFactor \n— Vikki Stone (@vikkistone) October 18, 2015 \n5. There is a time and a place for singing this song. i think it should be a public rule that \"Let it go\" is just for singing in the shower. \n— Emma Gannon (@girllostincity) October 18, 2015 \n6. Has it ended yet? HAS IT? when people sing 'let it go' #xfactor pic.twitter.com/TK2ObKBs6F \n— Pamela Rabe Fans (@rabeisqueen) October 18, 2015 \n7. Is this really actually happening? imagine 1) singing Let It Go on #XFactor 2) when you're on the Overs category and 3) getting it wrong \n— may zelda watson (@mayzwatson) October 18, 2015 \n8. Is there a way we can never hear this song again? This song should be banned from life. #XFactor #LetItGo \n9. Where exactly are we letting it go, Hannah? Let it go …home #xfactor \n— Ｓｔｏｒｍ Ｋｕｎｉｓ (@StormKunis) October 18, 2015 \n10. The seaweed is always greener in somebody else’s lake. 'Let it Go' from Frozen is a bad choice of song. She should have sun 'Under The Sea' from Little Mermaid. #XFactor \n— Daniel Audritt (@DanielAudritt) October 18, 2015 \n11. If anyone needs us, we’ll be outside banging our heads against the wall until we can get this bloody song off our minds. That girl that sang the song from frozen needs to GO.. Sounding like a pub karaoke session nah m8 #XFactor Share article \n— Zeena Xena (@ZeenaXena) October 18, 2015 Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:33:13.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
