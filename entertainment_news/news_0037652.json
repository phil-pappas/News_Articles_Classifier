(AP Photo/Brett Davis, File) From Staff and Wire Reports\nATHENS — Georgia’s new bulldog mascot has passed his audition and finally earned an official title.\n“Que,” who has served as the unofficial replacement for Uga IX this season, will be formally named Uga X at Georgia’s home game against Georgia Southern on Nov. 21.\nQue is replacing his grandfather, 11-year-old “Russ,” who worked 25 games as an interim mascot from 2009-12 and then 38 games as the official mascot from 2012-14. Russ compiled a record of 44-19.\n“Uga is cherished by University of Georgia fans worldwide,” said UGA president Jere Morehead. “We are grateful for Russ’ dedicated service, and we look forward to welcoming Que as our new mascot.”\nThe 1-year-old Que made his debut as mascot in Georgia’s preseason picture day for fans, making his rise to official status only a formality.\nFrank “Sonny” Seiler’s family, based in Savannah, has bred the line of English bulldog mascots since Uga I made his debut in 1956.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14830740.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14830938.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14830938.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14830740.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:16:09.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
