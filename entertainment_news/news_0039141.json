In a very rare sight, the two join forces to save Hakeem who was kidnapped in the most recent episode. Dealing with his kidnappers, Hakeem struggles with how to feel and act like a man. Jamal does his best to get back in the studio and break away from being defined solely as a gay artist. Andre, in the meantime, is clashing with his father over a decision making in the company. He also works to shut down a division at Empire, until he discovers a disciple in the midst of Lucious' Gutter Life records. Meanwhile, Cookie is getting closer to Laz Delgado (guest star Adam Rodriguez ). Gushing about Cookie's relationship with the concert promoter, showrunner Ilene Chaiken tells Variety, \"You're going to learn a little bit more about him in the next episode. I thought there was some crackling tension between them. Clearly she's intrigued, and he's intrigued. They're flirting - straight up! I've never noticed Cookie sitting too long on that type of feelings. I think they're two people who are quite likely to act on their attraction to each other.\" \"A High Hope for a Low Heaven\" is currently scheduled to air Wednesday, November 4 as the show's slot next week is emptied for the World Series. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:18.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
