Digital Spy rounds up what the critics have to say below: \n© AMC / Frank Ockenfels 3 Mike Hale - The New York Times \" The Walking Dead , AMC's post-apocalyptic zombie fantasy, has always built toward and ebbed away from great set pieces of carnage and battle. Its 90-minute sixth-season premiere on AMC on Sunday night is essentially an episode-long combat operation, and it reaches for a new level of cinematic wallop. \"A double narrative that shows the preparations for, and execution of, an elaborate zombie-clearing action, it variously recalls Hollywood biblical epics, European art-house pastorals and the teeming photographs of Sebastião Salgado.\" Brian Lowry - Variety \"Picking up where season 5 left off, while embarking on new plots, The Walking Dead looks very much at the top of its game, with strong character material mixed with a massive set piece in the extended premiere made possible, no doubt, by its enormous popularity. \"The show has constantly reinvented itself by both shifting venues and turning over characters, a formula that has kept the programme's soap opera aspects fresh, even if the threat from marauding zombies remains continuous.\"In a perverse way, AMC's experiment with spinoff Fear the Walking Dead only enhances the original, having demonstrated that even a zombie apocalypse can be rendered mundane and lifeless by plodding storytelling and weak characters. And while the ratings were unsurprisingly good enough to justify a renewal, those six weeks in L.A. have likely done nothing quite so much as stoke appetites for another gory helping of the real deal.\" \n© AMC / Frank Ockenfels 3 Noel Murray - Rolling Stone \"To say that this show is coming back strong would be an understatement. 'First Time Again' is not just an incredible season premiere but is arguably one of the series' best instalments to date, combining moody \"What does it mean to be alive?\" philosophising with the kind of action-packed Big Mission that usually gets reserved for finales. \"From one of the chilling first shots - peering down into a ravine filled with armies of walkers, blockaded by freight-trucks - the episode heralds a heightened sense of urgency, rare for a drama where the characters have often been merely reactive. It manages to take stock of the ramifications from last season's bloody end, while loudly roaring forward.\" Rebecca Hawkes - The Telegraph \"While Lincoln's performance was gripping, and the scenes of the huge Walker-infested pit both gory and dramatic – those pale, nameless zombie extras really do make the show – the structure of the episode itself was a little odd, with a series of lengthy black and white flashbacks filtered through the main event.Ultimately, however, while these hints at future conflict were intriguing, the decision to flip between backstory and main event was too jarring, removing any sense of urgency: this was nowhere near as tense as the explosive cannibal showdown that marked the beginning of season five.\" Tim Goodman - The Hollywood Reporter \"Say this about The Walking Dead - there's an excitement to the notion of survival, even when it's played out in repetitive ways. That is especially true in this episode, which aims to go very big before some of the players go home.\" The Walking Dead hasn't tripped up much to lose viewers – they are insanely loyal – so the idea of doing the same thing over and over again isn't going to be the death knell for ratings. But there's always the hope that the series keeps being relevant by sticking to what makes it work (the humanity) and avoids the repetitive dramatic tricks (we trusted people we shouldn't have – again) that curtail its potential.\"Here's hoping the epic opening to season six points to a new, unfamiliar direction.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:06:33.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
