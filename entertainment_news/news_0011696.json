Stine"], "text": "Tweet Published: Wed, October 21, 2015 @ 12:00 a.m. \nR.L. Stine is a master of mystery, but his life is the subject of a book. His story is told in “It Came From Ohio!” subtitled “My Life as a Writer,” by Stine, as told to Joe Arthur and Susan Lurie. Scholastic Books published it in 1997 and updated it in 2015; it’s designed to appeal to fourth- to sixth-graders. Some tidbits gleaned from the book, as “Goosebumps” the movie opens Friday: \nv Initials: R.L. stands for Robert Lawrence and friends call him Bob. \nv Ohio roots: He was born in Bexley, a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, on Oct. 8, 1943, so he just turned 72. \nv Typing style: To the horror of typing teachers everywhere (if such a profession still exists), he is a one-finger typist but a speedy one. \nv Prolific: That didn’t stop him from writing roughly 330 books, including “scary ones, joke books, funny books, adventure books, choose-your-own-ending books, and so on,” he says in answering the 20 most asked questions in the back of “It Came From Ohio!” \nv Fearful: He was a fearful boy and clearly recalls being panic-stricken and embarrassed at a day camp when he could not jump into a swimming pool as part of a Red Cross badge test. That moment serves him when he writes about a child who is terrified. \n“Hellevator” (8 p.m., GSN): Be afraid. Be very afraid. From the twisted minds that brought you “Paranormal Activity” comes “Hellevator.” It’s a game show that challenges contestants to ride a haunted elevator and complete terrifying tasks before time runs out on them. \n“Do Not Disturb: HOTEL HORRORS” (9 P.M., INVESTIGATION DISCOVERY): These rooms are killer! \n“They Took Our Child: WE GOT HER BACK” (10 P.M., LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK): The names says it all but fails to answer this basic question: If you had her back, how were they able to take her in the first place? \nTV listings, B6 \n‘Downton Abbey’ costume lecture \nPOLAND \nLibrarian Kathy Richter will give a presentation on the “Downton Abbey” costume exhibit at he Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C., at 6:30 p.m. Monday in the meeting room of the Poland Library. \nRichter, who visited Biltmore this year, will show photographs of the costumes, and give a brief history of Biltmore Estate.
