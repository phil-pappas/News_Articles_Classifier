The answer isn't 42: it's a roomful of waxwork James Bonds. \nMadame Tussauds London has revealed wax figures of all the actors who have played James Bond, with five completely new waxworks joining the incumbent 007 Daniel Craig. \nAs fans prepare for the release of Spectre on October 26, Craig is joined by ex-Bonds Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. \nThey will appear at the tourist attraction for six weeks, before embarking on a tour of Madame Tussauds locations across the world on December 1. \nCraig, Connery, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan have previously been made into waxworks, meaning Madame Tussauds already had their measurements – but it was a first time for Lazenby, star of On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), who modelled for the museum's artists in Los Angeles in February. \nAccording to Madame Tussauds, the figures took four months for a team of 20 artists to complete, at a cost of £150,000 each. Each hair on all of the figures' heads was inserted individually by hand, a process which took six weeks. \nThe Bonds have been posed in dinner suits based on the original costumes and designed by Oscar-winning costume designer, Lindy Hemming. \nGeneral manager of Madame Tussauds London, Edward Fuller, said Bond fans could look forward to \"measuring up to their personal favourite 007, whether it's the Bond they grew up with, the first they saw in the cinema or the current incarnation they'll see in Spectre\". \nHe added: \"One thing is for sure, whoever your favourite Bond is – you can meet them here in wax.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:08:11.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
