It seems child kidnappers are on the prowl in these posh shopping establishments. Two women tried to kidnap the six-year-old son of a popular Kannada actor (who did not want to be named) in a mall in Rajajinagar on Sunday when the actor's wife and son were out shopping.\nThe three kidnappers were all women. While one of them started speaking to the actor's wife, two others had taken hold of the child and were gagging his mouth. The alert mother immediately started screaming, at which point the kidnappers dropped the boy and ran away. What has upset the parents is the fact that neither the mall security nor anyone else came to their rescue; nor did they make any effort to catch the kidnappers who made good their escape. Later, the actor's family watched CCTV footage and realised that these women were lurking in the mall for a long time, probably scouting for women with children.\nOn Wednesday, the actor who returned to Bengaluru after completing shooting for a film, confronted the security authorities at the mall. The incident could have happened to anyone, he said, and demanded an explanation on why none of the numerous security people came to help when his wife shouted for assistance. He was also upset to know that the many security people there could not speak the local language and hence were of no use in times of a crisis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:09:14.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
