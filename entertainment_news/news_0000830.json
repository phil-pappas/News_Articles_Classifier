The CRTC can discuss corrective actions with individuals, firms or organizations engaged in telemarketing, which may lead to a settlement that includes an administrative monetary penalty and other corrective measures. The CRTC can also issue warnings and citations, conduct inspections and issue notices of violation.\nAbout the National Do Not Call List\nThe National DNCL was launched in 2008 to protect Canadians from unsolicited telecommunications.
