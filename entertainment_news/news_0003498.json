(Also Read: Nancy Drew TV series in works) \n“I wanted to do something fun for the 10th anniversary and the publisher wanted like a foreword and I thought, ‘Well, maybe something more interesting.’“Meyer decided to rework the entire book in response to complaints from fans that Bella, who ultimately decides to become a vampire in order to be with Edward, was portrayed as the “typical damsel in distress.”\"It’s always bothered me a little bit. Because anyone surrounded by superheroes is going to be… In distress. We don’t have the powers. I thought, ‘What if we switched it around a bit and see how a boy does,’ and, you know, it’s about the same.” \nBut she does not think the new edition will be made into a movie like the original, which starred Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.”I don’t really see that happening,” Meyer said.While the new plot is very similar to the original, the writer said there are key differences.”I do feel like it’s really very much the same thing so I guess my hope is that maybe the younger readers will be reintroduced because a lot of my readers, you know, they’re all 10 years older now and so there’s a whole new generation.” \nModified Date: October 8, 2015 9:07 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:07:13.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
