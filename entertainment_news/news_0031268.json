It’s the way she reveals the vulnerable humanity behind a woman with a remarkable gift she wanted to share with the world, only to be thwarted by a system that limited, challenged and incarcerated black artists at every opportunity.\nLanie Robertson’s 1986 biographical play, which won Audra McDonald her sixth Tony Award last year, takes place in a run-down bar in Philadelphia in 1959, four months before the singer’s death at 44. Holiday enters smiling but barely keeping it together, chugging alcohol at every opportunity. Her pianist Jimmy Powers, played here by Geno Young, watches her with care and concern as he tries to keep her on track with the list of songs the customers demand.\nHoliday, however, is in a confessional mood. In between songs, she spills out details of her life to her “friends,” as she refers to the audience. She talks about her tough early life, including a stint in a brothel as a young teen and later singing with a white band at segregated hotels that banned her from visiting the bar, the dining room and even the restroom.\nLee finds the heart-rending link between the singer and songs. She sets up “God Bless the Child,” which she wrote, by sharing the time she asked her mother for help and her mother refused. “When a Woman Loves a Man” becomes achingly personal when she talks about the abusive men in her life. Under Sharon Benge’s subtle direction, Lee takes us on a journey where she becomes increasingly fragile as the collective weight of painful memories wears her down.\nTim Catlett’s gritty, brick-walled set, with Young on the upright piano beside Kevin Arthur on the bass, suggests an intimate dive. Barbara O’Donoghue’s costumes and Madalyn Russell’s stylish hair and makeup design provide the touch of glamour that make Lee’s Holiday as radiant as the gardenia in her hair.\nAs an added bonus, there’s an uncredited appearance by an extremely cute little dog, playing Holiday’s dog, that was very friendly to the folks in the front row Sunday afternoon.\nPlan your life\nContinues through Nov. 1 at Jubilee Theatre, 506 Main St., Fort Worth. $24-$28; $40 for on-stage seating. 817-338-4411. jubileetheatre.org.
