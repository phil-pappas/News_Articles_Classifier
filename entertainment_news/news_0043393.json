Twenty teams participated in the longest running homecoming event at UAB.\nThe Gurney Derby is one of the most popular UAB Homecoming Week traditions. Teams of four, two men and two women, race down and back on a stretch of 13th Street South while pushing a \"passenger\" on old hospital gurneys.\nMonkeys, a knight in a suit of armor and several stuffed animals got to ride on the gurneys this year.\nThis year, the Gurney Derby was blessed with perfect weather and the event drew a nice crowd. First place went to the School of Education. Their team made the circuit in a snappy 28.20 seconds.\nThe theme of Homecoming 2015 is \"Blazer Strong â€“ Go UAB. Go Blazers. Go Birmingham.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.uab.edu/alumni/142-uncategorised/550-homecoming-week-15"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:41:01.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
