Some reports even suggest that he is considering signing Hrithik Roshan. The filmmaker has, however, dismissed the casting buzz.\n\nSalman Khan, Hrithik Roshan and (inset) Kabir Khan \nKabir says, “These are just talks (rumours). I am the sort who likes to discuss ideas with stars. Hrithik is one of them. And as far as Salman is concerned, obviously, we would like to come back with a film. So, we are just discussing ideas, but when I lock it, I will make an announcement. I do not keep stars in mind while writing a script.”\nIn fact, the director-producer is yet to flesh out the script of his next. “I have a couple of ideas, but I am not sure if I will develop any of them. I am taking my time after having worked hard for the last couple of years. I will lock an idea by this year-end and work out a full-fledged script by mid-2016,” adds Kabir.\nHe reveals that he is making a conscious attempt to stay away from cross-border politics or bilateral relations, unlike his previous projects -- 'Phantom', 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', 'Kabul Express' (2006) and 'New York' (2009). He says: “Unfortunately, global terrorism is in your face; it invariably tends to become a part of my films. But, it wasn’t deliberate. However, now that people have pointed it out, I am trying to stay away from it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:23:01.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
