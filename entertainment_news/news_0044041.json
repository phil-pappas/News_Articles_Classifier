Naomi Campbell makes her debut in the episode as a fashion editor who does not get along with the Countess.

In \"Chutes and Ladders\", fashion mogul Will Drake brings couture to the Hotel Cortez, a model catches The Countess's eye, and John learns about the hotel's sadistic first owner. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:19.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
