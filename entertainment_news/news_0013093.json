Source: News Corp Australia \nThe tight production schedules of the match entertainment meant that not all artists can have their band perform fully live in the middle of the massive sports ground. \nGoulding and her backing vocalists sing live and her band mimes their “playing”. \n“I think technically the thing that people don’t understand is when I am given a gig like that, I don’t have the option of playing with my band live,” she said. \n“We’re given this amazing opportunity to play and they say ‘We ain’t got time for you to play live, we’ve got other singers to deal with, we’ve got Bryan Adams and whoever else’. \n“People don’t realise that most of their favourite artists, their favourite performers, have to do that all the time.” \nGoulding not only managed to get her gig back on track but defended herself admirably on social media afterwards as fans also rallied to support her.

I don’t bloody lip-synch. If I lip-synched I would be terrible at it,” she said. \n“Saturday was fun, we were all having such a laugh and whatever, it doesn’t bother me, I know people here know I perform well live. I’ve got other things to worry about right now.”One of those things concerning the On My Mind artist is her health. \nAs well as battling the flu before her AFL gig and Sunday night’s concert, the renowned fitness fanatic revealed she has had to stop exercising in the last week. Good times ... Goulding says Team Ellie had fun at the AFL Grand Final despite the technical glitches which railroaded her performance.

I’m fine, it’s actually something someone discovered last year but I never got it checked out. Which is terrible, I have been playing with my life,” she said. \n“So I have been very relaxed, I have been chilling and not being as militant about what I eat. \n“It’s nice to know you actually can’t go to the gym, you’re not allowed.” \nGoulding is finalising negotiations for her return to tour in support of Delirium next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:47:59.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
