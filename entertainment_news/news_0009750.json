The film focuses on some of the pointless aspects of the education system and this particular song, which features lead actor Kishore as a disgruntled lecturer, is laced with sarcasm about the ironic realities that are part of the life of college students. The lyrics, penned by the film's director Madhu Chandra, have gone down rather well with those who can take a joke (read â€” college students themselves). So much so that you have a lot of the student community across the state putting up one or another line from this song as their status message.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:25:17.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
