She can be queen, but also kid sister, killer or girl next door,” writes Benjamin Markovits in the Esquire story accompanying Emilia’s nude cover. \nLisa Hintelmann, editorial projects director for the magazine, called the actress the “all-around favourite”. \n“Emilia Clarke is unforgettable in Game Of Thrones and was hands down the number one choice of Esquire’s staff, friends and family,” she said. \nEmilia followed her brother into boarding school because “I fancied his friends,” she told Esquire, then she went on to study drama in college, pulling a couple of episodes on the long-running British daytime soap Doctors after graduation. She worked multiple jobs while living with friends before Game Of Thrones changed her life when it began airing in 2011. \nThe actress recalled some difficulties on the show early on. She was just 23. There was full frontal nudity, lots of sex, even a rape scene. She tells Markovits how she suffered along with her character.
