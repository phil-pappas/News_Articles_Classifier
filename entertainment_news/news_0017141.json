You couldn't get away with just focusing on a woman's size these days, but it seems to be all right to do that (to a man). It makes me a bit cross sometimes.\" \n\"So when I go out, I am particularly recognisable, I think. The only person I hang out with who is more recognisable is Matt Lucas, who is recognisable from 100 yards away. And he gets it constantly... people taking photos or double-taking.\" \nWhile he does get recognised thanks to his Office character, he said: \"Gareth was an odd-looking bloke, with the hair... so therefore people will always think of me as a pale, unhealthy, pasty-looking weirdo. \n\"And people also hear a West Country accent when I'm talking, when there isn't one. I am from Kent. My accent is Kentish.\" \nThe latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales, is due out in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:50:44.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
