Already, RGV unveiled the film's trailer around a month ago and it created a lot of interest among his fans. Now, the director is readying to release a new trailer on 18th October at 10:40 PM. Interestingly, RGV chose this particular date and time to release the trailer as Veerappan was killed on 18th October at the same time in an encounter with ​STF​ in 2004​. Killing Veerappan stars Kannada superstar Shivrajkumar playing the cop who killed Veerappan while Delhi-based theatre artist Sandeep Bharadwaj plays Veerappan. ​Killing Veerappan also stars Kannada actresses Yagna Shetty and Parul Yadav and it will release ​in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Hindi.​ Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:43:25.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
