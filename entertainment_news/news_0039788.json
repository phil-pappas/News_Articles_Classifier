This is what happened to @ollymurs when we had 12 weeks training to get tour ready During the 12 weeks we trained 3 times a week and Olly had 3 weeks where he didn't train. The tour itself was fantastic and it was great to see Olly improve every night as his strength, fitness, mobility and performance grew. This is what it's like to be trained by @rob_solly Picture taken from @ollymurs new book On The Road out now. #ollymurs #transformation #weightloss #personaltrainer #performancecoach #personaltraining #robsolly #fitspiration #fitness #youoptimised #agilityhealthperformance #techniqueovereverything #techniqueuberallesA photo posted by Rob Solly (@rob_solly) on Oct 13, 2015 at 10:03am PDTThe regime was designed to get Olly tour-ready on a deadline of 12 weeks. Interestingly, the training also seems to have had a dramatic effect on his selfie face.Murs recently previewed his latest single 'Kiss Me' from his repackaged Never Been Better album, which will be out on November 20.He currently hosts The X Factor with Caroline Flack, who earlier today shared a bizarre picture of her \"broken\" arm.
