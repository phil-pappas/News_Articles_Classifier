It's not as if one ingredient is particularly Japanese. But this pie has shown up at family reunions and the monthly church potluck for what seems like forever. It's decidedly Southern and is a twist on a pecan pie with fruit thrown in.\nNot that a pecan pie needs improving, but this is an interesting switch-up. In digging through my mom's and grandmother's recipe files, I found several copies of the same pie with few changes. But there is one variation that I love: Lemon juice and zest are substitutes for the distilled vinegar.\nFresh lemon and lemon zest always make things taste brighter and better. Suddenly this predictable pie is elevated to \"favorite\" status.
