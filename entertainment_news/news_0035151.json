Image copyright MGM/Columbia/Eon Image caption Spectre is Daniel Craig's fourth stint as 007 \nSpectre is the third Bond film chosen for the Royal Film Performance since its inception in 1946. It follows previous premieres for Die Another Day (2002) and Skyfall (2012). \nEarly reviews have been positive, with some critics awarding the film five stars. \nSpeaking to the BBC last week, Craig said he had not made any decisions about whether he would carry on playing 007. Image caption Red carpet preparations are well underway at the Royal Albert Hall \nThe actor, on his fourth outing as the superspy, had told Time Out magazine that he would \"rather slash [his] wrists\" than make a fifth Bond film. \nBut he told the BBC's Lizo Mzimba: \"I'm quite straightforward and I say things when I feel it and then I change my mind. I'm just like everybody else.\" \nSpectre was shot at Pinewood Studios and filmed on location in London, Mexico City, Rome and Tangier and Erfoud, in Morocco. \nThe shadowy organisation Spectre - which was previously an acronym for the Special Executive for Counter-Intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion - last made an appearance in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever, with Sean Connery as Bond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:05:02.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
