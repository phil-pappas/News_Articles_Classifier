Anyone who wears braces while also wearing pyjamas is not trustworthy to answer a phone correctly.

Her accent makes her words so much sassier. #TheApprentice \n— Kirstie Saunders (@KirstieLouiseS) October 21, 2015 \nAnd one of their first tests was to find out who could speak French within each group to make trading easier overseas. \"I have an A Level\"\"That's very good.\"😂😂😂😂 #TheApprentice \n— Frodo Swaggins (@hellyeh_) October 21, 2015 \"Guys I can speak French, listen to this\"*clears throat*\"baguette\" #TheApprentice \nThe teams were given a list of items to buy and one of these, of course, was manure, which the teams dug up themselves. \nSome were less country-wise than others… \n— The Apprentice (@bbcapprentice) October 21, 2015 Don't know about you but I always shovel manure in my suede stilettos! #TheApprentice #BBCApprentice \n— Pauline Martin (@ChampagnePaulie) October 21, 2015 \nThey were also asked to buy a particular cheese, but unfortunately, the girls bought the wrong kind. Important life lesson: never skimp on cheese. Never. (Never) #TheApprentice \n— Rowan Coleman (@rowancoleman) October 21, 2015 THEY BOUGHT THE WRONG CHEESE ALAN #TheApprentice pic.twitter.com/zzRqXnuwsA \nAs the episode went on, Vana’s attitude appeared to grate on Twitter users. Vana's attitude stinks #TheApprentice \n— James Flanagan (@JamesFl) October 21, 2015 Why is Katie Hopkins wearing a brunette wig and speaking in an American accent? #TheApprentice \n— Brian Butterfield (@MrBButterfield) October 21, 2015 When project manager thinks she's queen #theapprentice https://t.co/jHuqYe9eij \n— £transfinancal£ (@behlul_official) October 21, 2015 \nBut others appreciated her honesty. I love that Vanna is so honest and speaks her mind, calls people on their game-playing. I really hope it doesn't hurt her #TheApprentice \n— Roisin Hogan (@RoisinEHogan) October 21, 2015 \nUltimately, Jenny was sent packing after Vana dubbed her a “deadweight”. However, she didn’t go out without a fight, giving the longest ‘thank you’ speech in Apprentice history. Maybe. Longest ThankyoufortheoppourtunityLordSugar ever. #TheApprentice Nice speech there Jenny, changed my life #inspirational #TheApprentice Share article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:41:52.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
