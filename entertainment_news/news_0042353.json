JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images An Israeli Zaka volunteer stands next to the body of the attacker. Previous Next Enlarge An Arab armed with a screwdriver stabbed four Israelis on Thursday before he was shot dead.\nThe latest “lone wolf” attack at a busy Tel Aviv intersection stunned a country hardened by years of terror attacks and raised fresh fears that another Palestinian uprising was brewing.\nAnd it prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to temporarily bar lawmakers from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — a spot holy to both Muslims and Jews — that has become a flashpoint for violence.\nIn the past week, four Israelis have been killed in attacks and six Palestinians have died in the latest unrest. More than 130 Palestinians have been wounded in demonstrations and clashes across the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n“More bloodshed will only lead to more hatred on both sides,” said United Nations human rights honcho Zeid Raad al-Hussein, who called for calm in the West Bank.\nIsraeli officials did not identify the screwdriver-wielding stabber, whose victims included a female soldier.\nBut this was just the latest in a spate of attacks involving young Palestinians who don’t appear to have any connections to militant groups.\nJACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images Volunteers move the body of a Palestinian man who was shot dead after he stabbed four people, including an Israeli soldier, Thursday in Tel Aviv. Earlier, a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem stabbed a 25-year-old Israeli student in the neck, seriously wounding him, said Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri.\nThe Israelis arrested the teen but did not release his name.\nIn the West Bank, another Israeli man was seriously wounded after a young Palestinian stabbed him in the stomach, Samri said.\nThe Israeli army was searching for the attacker, who vanished after the lighting-quick attack.\nMeanwhile, Palestinian protesters clashed once more with Israeli soldiers at several spots across the occupied West Bank.\nNetanyahu’s move to ban lawmakers from the holy site put him at odds with the Jewish hard-liners in his governing coalition. They have been demanding harsh crackdowns on Palestinians and expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\nBAZ RATNER/REUTERS Israeli police officers patrol near the scene of the stabbing attack. Netanyahu, however, is desperate to avoid another bloody Palestinian uprising.\nMuch of the latest fighting has been fueled by Palestinian fears that Israel is trying to tighten its grip on the Temple Mount, which is where the Al-Aqsa mosque is located.\nNetanyahu has repeatedly denied that Israel is trying to monopolize the spot, which is the holiest in Judaism.\nIt is also the spot where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven.\nUnder the current rules, Jews are allowed to visit the compound during set hours — but not pray there.\nWith News Wire Services\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Palestinian assailants carry out stabbing attacks in Israel Palestinian president quits on pacts with Israel Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will remove muzzle on media", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:16:28.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
