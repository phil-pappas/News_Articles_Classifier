In fact, the ubiquity of social media and the apparent need to express one’s inner Fellini or Spielberg [and what’s wrong with that?] have created a perfect storm for filmmakers of all stripes. \nJoby has been in the business of video tools and peripherals for enough time to develop a solid sense of what works in the real world. \nThe Jib Kit lets you grab smooth, swooping camera moves at a sufficient distance from your body. Compatible with all action cameras [GoPro, Sony, Contour], the kit features two adjustable mounts that attach to cylindrical poles, such as an extension pole or monopod. Joby also sells a package with the Jib Kit and three aluminum poles. \nOne clamp of the Jib Kit goes towards the base of the pole, providing a handle to operate a pulley system, while the other goes at the end of the pole and features a camera mounting bracket. A pulley cord is included that can be tied to accommodate spacing the clamps between 35″ and 49″ apart. When installed, you can use your pole to capture unique jib-style shots, with camera tilts controlled by turning the handle on the base clamp. This allows for two moving planes: the camera can be tilting as the pole is swinging. The handle is like that on a bike, and hence a familiar ergonomic design. \nA 1/4″-20 screw on the handle grip lets you attach optional accessories, such as a Joby Arm and GripTight to support your phone for remote video monitoring and camera control. I found that with some experimentation, the remote phone was superfluous, although very helpful at the outset. \nThe entire rig is quite light, which is a boon when undertaking a long day of shoots. \nIt all packs into a handy carrying bag, making production hassles far less than what Spielberg encountered on the set of E.T.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:42:01.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
