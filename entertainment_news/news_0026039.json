By India.com Entertainment Desk on October 9, 2015 at 10:37 AM Comments \nKamaal R Khan is known for being a nuisance to Bollywood celebrities for his attention seeking tactics. The Deshdrohi actor KRK tries to stay in limelight by making some not so very decent comments on popular celebrities of the Bollywood industry. He comes up with rather controversial comments on anything and everything happening around. And he is back with what he does best! KRK is yet again targeting the Kapoor lad after having an ugly war with Rishi Kapoor. \nThis time KRK is targeting Ranbir Kapoor ahead of the release of Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor starrer Tamasha. What started this ranting was the brand new song Matargashti. KRK was so taken aback by the song that he made us take a walk down the memory lane of Ranbir Kapoor’s flop movies that still haunt him. (ALSO READ: Tamasha UNSEEN pictures will make you fall in love with Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika Padukone once again!) \nKRK tweeted: “This chutiyapa song of #Tamasha is proof Ki Ye Imtiyaz Ali Ne Badaa Karnama Kar Diya. If #Tamasha will become flop then Even Karan Johar can’t save Ranbir Kapoor from becoming super flop kapoor like Rishi, Randhir, Rajive etc. These washout films of Ranbir Kapoor will remain in the history forever as destroyers #Besharam #Roy #BomabyVelvet #Tamasha #JaggaJasoos” \nKRK is confident that Tamasha will be a flop just like his previous movies Besharam, Roy and Bombay Velvet. Although it is true that Kapoor has been delivering nonstop duds, but just going by the new song and deciding the fate of the movie KRK is being rather mean and not sensible. \nThe upcoming flick Tamasha seems to have taken some huge doze of inspiration from the earlier Ranbir-Deepika flick Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, but the brand new song Matagashti is a fresh never heard before peppy song.
