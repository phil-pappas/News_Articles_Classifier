Wells' science-fiction novel - and the cover letter from the network apologizing for the mass hysteria created by the realistic dramatization of a Martian invasion of Earth. It came from another collector and sold for $28,800.\nIn addition, a typed manuscript with Welles' handwritten directorial notes for a proposed television adaptation of \"Citizen Kane\" in the 1950s brought $20,480.\nWelles directed and starred in \"Citizen Kane,\" about the rise and fall of a publishing tycoon.
