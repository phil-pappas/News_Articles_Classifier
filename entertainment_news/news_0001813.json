Rollo Ross reports.   \nA second trailer has been released for 'The Revenant', after the first one posted in July reportedly got nearly 16 million views in three days. The film marks not only Leonardo DiCaprio's return to the big screen since 2013's 'Wolf of Wall Street', but also the first film by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu since his Oscar win for 'Birdman'. Based on a true story from the early 19th Century, DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a fur trapper left for dead by his colleague following a bear attack. That colleague is played by Tom Hardy, and DiCaprio's Glass will stop at nothing to wreak his revenge against his former friend. 'The Revenant' goes on global release in January.  //reut.rs/1MH9zf0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:05:35.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
