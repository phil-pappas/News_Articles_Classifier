It looked as though Mr Cowell might have changed his tune (if you‚Äôll pardon the pun) and was actually going to embrace the Overs. But it didn‚Äôt take long for him to unleash the sass. Pleased the old Simon is back, the show needed a bit of spark injected back into it. Everyone was being far too nice #XFactor \n‚Äî Gogglebox Scarlett (@ScarlettMoffatt) October 18, 2015 \nHere are Simon‚Äôs five sassiest moments from Sunday‚Äôs dramatic episode. \n1. Simon the X Factor contestant slayer started off by totally dismissing Holly Johnson, who had already been dumped and brought back at the Boot Camp phase. After all that, Simon shot down her rendition of Happy with a simple ‚ÄúHolly, this is very easy: it‚Äôs a no‚Äù. Ouch. Simon Cowell is the King of putting people down!! Holly stood no chance lol üòÇüòÇ #XFactor Promoted stories \n‚Äî Chris Kennedy (@CBrentfordFC) October 18, 2015 \n2. Next up was little Max Stone and his very sad eyes. Before Max had even begun to sing, Simon told him he looked ‚Äúhalf dead‚Äù and asked if he had ever done anything fun in his life. Poor stunned Max came out with a stunned ‚Äúerrr‚Ä¶this?‚Äù while Simon smirked smugly on. Simon seriously you can't say that about someone maybe max is shy! Don't be so rude & a bully! He has the voice that's what matters! #XFactor \n‚Äî Lauran Elder (@lauranelder) October 18, 2015 \n3. Vicky Ann Nash took to the hotseat next with a lovely rendition of Lisa Loeb‚Äôs Stay. But it wasn‚Äôt lovely enough for Simon, who claimed that Lisa didn‚Äôt seem ambitious OR focused. He‚Äôs really on a roll. That poor girl, poor Vicky #xfactor \n‚Äî Meshi Taka (@Meshi_Kiyang) October 18, 2015 \n4. Next in the firing line was Stephanie Court, who looked perfectly radiant in a sparkly dress and red lipstick. Simon bluntly said ‚Äúpeople just don‚Äôt like you‚Äù. Hands up if you‚Äôve ever felt personally victimised by Simon Cowell? What has Stephanie done that is so bad? She can sing #xfactor \n‚Äî Kelle Salle (@Kelle_S6) October 18, 2015 \n5. Anton Stephans took to the stage, staring out at the audience with his very unnerving buldgy eyes. Simon told Anton that he pulls some weird old faces and that it distracts everyone from his singing. Weird faces or not, its undeniable Anton has some great vocals #xfactor \n‚Äî Caramel Hazel (@miss_hazel06) October 18, 2015 \n6. Tonatha told Simon that she‚Äôs a ‚Äúsafe bet‚Äù because she ‚Äúwould love to be worked with‚Äù unlike other contestants (who is she throwing shade at, we wonder?) and that she has the performance and the look down. Unsurprisingly, Simon retorted she‚Äôs FAR from a safe bet. Sassy. Tonatha getting a bit big time with that comment! #XFactor #6ChairChallenge #xf2015 \n‚Äî MR SUPERPIDGE (@superpidge) October 18, 2015 Share article \nAfter much chair swapping, many tears and worried looks from Caroline Flack, Simon finally chose Max, Ebru, Jennifer, Bupsi, Kerrie-Anne and Anton and his final picks. Who will make it through to the live shows? Find out next Saturday at 7.30pm.
