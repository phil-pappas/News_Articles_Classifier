The thriller has the benefit of the network's best time slot, behind The Voice on Mondays. While the show averaged 10.6 million viewers last Monday, still below The Blacklist 's early performance in 2013, by Thursday that total had climbed to an impressive 15.2 million. \nCBS's Life in Pieces , also in a protected Monday slot (behind The Big Bang Theory ) was solid, though it had far less delayed viewing, while CBS movie sequel Limitless and ABC's The Muppets , both on Tuesdays, also posted promising starts. The Muppets are back in primetime with the debut of their brand-new, self-titled show. And they're a lot more grown up than we remembered. Newslook \nEarly-season turkeys included NBC's Thursday drama The Player; Fox's movie sequel Minority Report , which claimed just 3.1 million viewers Monday; and horror-comedy Scream Queens , which notched 4 million Tuesday. Though that figure had climbed to 7.3 million by Friday (including 1 million online streams) and was pronounced by Fox \"a model for contemporary viewership,\" it's still a weak showing for the opener of a heavily promoted new series from producer Ryan Murphy, whose American Horror Story did better on cable's FX network. \nOther shows occupy a middle ground: ABC's Quantico claimed 7.1 million viewers Sunday, which looks impressive only when compared to Revenge , which it replaced. And NBC's Heroes Reborn averaged 6.1 million Thursday (climbing to 8.7 million by Sunday), matching the franchise's last premiere in 2009. Nielsens: 'CSI' finale, 'Empire' return \nSome things don't change: The top three shows among all viewers last week were NBC's Sunday Night Football and CBS's The Big Bang Theory and NCIS, just like last year, with Fox's Empire close behind. Among young-adult viewers, NFL also remained tops, followed by Empire and Big Bang . \nHelped by a better Thursday Night Football matchup, CBS is roughly flat vs. last year, and has again won premiere week in total viewers, while NBC claimed the young-adult crown for the fourth consecutive year, also assisted by Sunday NFL games. NBC, ABC and Fox are down 10% to 20% from last fall's premiere week and in early results have suffered among viewers ages 18 to 34. 672 CONNECT 98 TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1KJpg4w TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:51:06.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
