Thanks so much guys. I’m pretty sure this is just because I have cute cats though,” she wrote. \nKeeping Up With The Kardashians star Kim trails behind with 48.4million followers while fellow music star Beyonce’s 47.5million seems almost pitiful in the wake of Taylor’s massive Instagram squad. \nTaylor has two moggies, Meredith Grey and Olivia Benson, and frequently posts p-awesome shots of her feline friends to the delight of fans. \nTaylor recently told NME that “people might need a break from me” after her world tour wraps up in December. \nBut the nearly 14,500 retweets and 1.2million Instagram likes on her new GQ cover suggest otherwise. Thanks @GQMagazine for my first cover :) pic.twitter.com/lzCz5MbMHT \n— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) October 8, 2015 Share article \nFans couldn’t get enough of the sultry cover shoot where Taylor flashes her thighs in just a black bikini and cover-up.
