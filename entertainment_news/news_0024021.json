Imagine them trying to throw these chairs using only their feet and their heads. Wouldn’t work!\nHere’s another angle of the melee, which police say also involved fans of the Polish club Slask Wroclaw. Slask and Sevilla supporters went at it when the two clubs played in a Europa League match in 2013. Slask fans were stabbed and their banner was stolen by the Spanish hooligans. Yesterday they sought their revenge in Manchester, not with knives, but with the preferred weapon of the the unhinged soccer hooligan: anything that’s not bolted to the ground.\nAs for who won the soccer match itself? What soccer match?", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-3283109/Violence-breaks-Manchester-Manchester-City-meet-Sevilla-Champions-League-hooligans-hurl-chairs-city-centre.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOXvRMyuKUg", "http://www.ultras-tifo.net/news/1849-sevilla-hooligans-attacked-slask-fans-and-stole-them-all-banners.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDhoF0cfrg4"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:57:59.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
