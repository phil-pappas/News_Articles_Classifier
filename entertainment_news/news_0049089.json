KNOW TOMORROW . . . .\nI am teaching Prana Power Yoga™ TODAY at 2pm at a very important event in Boston, and I hope you join me and many others as we come together to KNOW TOMORROW .\nTo face climate change it’s going to take all of us — a movement in which each and every one of us takes action to motivate our political and business leaders to protect our planet and our society.\nTODAY, Bostonians have the opportunity to come together for climate action. KnowTomorrow , a student run organization, is having its local national Day of Action event at the Ritz Carlton on the Boston Common. Join us and enjoy FREE yoga, food and music, while focusing on climate change and the need for all of us to take action.\nClimate change is happening NOW. Remember the winter we had last year? It was the first spring I checked out real estate in South Carolina online (really, I did). This is our chance to come together and take action.\nFrom 2:00pm - 6:30pm, bands such as Speedy Ortiz, Outasight, Will Dailey, Kate Diaz, Natalie Joly and Starcatcher will be playing, accompanied by FREE Prana Power Yoga™ and delicious treats from Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, KIND Snacks, Vita Coco and Naked Juice.\nThe climate crisis affects all of us, and so this event will feature speakers from across the community and economy, including the keynote speaker, Massachusetts State Senator, Ed Markey, as well as Harvard Professor James Engell, Adam Sachs from Biodiversity for a Livable Climate, Roger Noonan from The New England Farmers Union, Dylan Husted from SaveOhno, Joel Gamoran from Yeloha, Initiative: Eau, and Know Tomorrow Boston co-director Shana Gallagher.\nClimate change challenges are enormous, but so is the power and hope of this opportunity. Let’s rise together and fight for the right of the environment.\nCheck out www.knowtomorrowboston.splashthat.com and come support this amazing cause, so that we can all KNOW TOMORROW.\nEvent address: 10 Avery St, Boston, MA 02111\nLive an Inspired Life.\nNamaste!\nTaylor Wells", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:21:54.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
