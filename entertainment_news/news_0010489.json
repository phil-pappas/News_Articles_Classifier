I was at the bottom of the hierarchy at that point, so you definitely bear the brunt of everybody's frustration,\" he said.\n\"In the kitchen I feel very comfortable so that was a great thing. I think it helped because we had no cooking doubles we did all the cooking, and it was a functioning kitchen.\"\nMiller said she underwent intensive training for the role of Helene Sweeney.\n\"I worked really hard with two Michelin star chef Marcus Wareing in London and I studied chefs,\" she said.\n\"I watched services in many different kitchens, I interviewed different women and men who work in those kind of kitchens and watched how they moved and I really wanted to immerse myself in it.\"\n\"Burnt\" opens in cinemas worldwide from Thursday.\n(Reporting by Reuters Television in New York; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in London; Editing by Louise Ireland)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:06:58.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
