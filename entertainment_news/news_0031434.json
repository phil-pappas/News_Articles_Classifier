(AP) - The manager of a private New Mexico ranch says he will continue to let movie productions film at the site despite a recent flap over American Indian artifacts.\nDiamond Tail Ranch manager Roch Hart told The Associated Press he's happy a 20th Century Fox investigation found that the cast from \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" didn't take any ancient items from the ranch.\nThe film's star, Dylan O'Brien, had suggested during an interview that artifacts were taken.\nHart says actors did not leave designated areas and the ranch isn't missing any artifacts.\nBut he says the case has convinced the ranch to impose stricter guidelines for future productions.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
