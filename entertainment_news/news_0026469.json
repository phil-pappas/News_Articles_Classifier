Directors: Ryan Fleck, Anna Boden \nLady Luck deals us a winning hand with writer-directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden's coolly assured character study. \nEarlier this year, Mark Wahlberg headlined an ill-conceived remake of James Toback's seminal 1974 drama The Gambler. \nMississippi Grind shuffles its cards from the same well-thumbed narrative deck and even features a pivotal cameo from Toback in the film's closing moments, when the fate of battered and bruised players rest on the turn of one card or the roll of a die.
