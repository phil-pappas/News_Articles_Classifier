She also will compete with Ariana Grande and Meghan Trainor for best pop/rock female artist and her single \"Blank Space\" is among the nominees for song of the year.\nSheeran and The Weeknd each had five nominations.\nTrainor, country newcomer Sam Hunt, Britain's Sam Smith, rapper Nicki Minaj and Ohio-based indie rock band Walk the Moon, each had three nominations. Hunt and Walk the Moon also picked up nods for best new artist, along with The Weeknd, New Jersey rapper Fetty Wap and Swedish indie pop singer Tove Lo.\nMusic superstars Beyonce and Justin Bieber racked up just one nomination apiece after a quiet year on the music scene.\nThe American Music Award nominations are based on fan interaction as reflected on Billboard magazine and its website, including album and digital sales, touring, radio airplay, social media and touring.\nFan voting opened online on Tuesday and the 10 artist of the year nominees will be narrowed to five based on votes received by Nov. 11.\nSinger and actress Jennifer Lopez will host the American Music Awards show from Los Angeles.
