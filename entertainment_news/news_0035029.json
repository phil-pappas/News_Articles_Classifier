Check out a new full-length trailer for \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,\" the upcoming film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's best-selling horror parody book, which reimagines the classic Jane Austen tale as an insane episode of \"The Walking Dead.\" The film follows Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her four sisters, Jane (Bella Heathcote), Kitty (Suki Waterhouse), Lydia (Ellie Bamber), and Mary (Millie Brady), as they use their extensive training in the martial arts and weaponry to rid the world of zombies, all the while still looking for Mr. Right. Courting the young ladies are Mr. Collins (Matt Smith), Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth), Mr. Wickham (Jack Huston). and Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley), who just might be the one who makes Elizabeth give up her sword for a wedding ring. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies stars Lily James, Bella Heathcote, Lena Headey, Sam Riley, Douglas Booth, Jack Huston, Matt Smith, Charles Dance, Suki Waterhouse, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady, Jess Radomska, Emma Greenwell, Aisling Loftus Release: February 5th, 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:35:24.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
