The men were evacuated to a hospital for treatment.\nSamri said attacks were likely \"nationalistically\" motivated. Israeli media reported the stabber said after his arrest that he carried out the attacks in retaliation for the numerous Palestinian attacks on Israelis this week .\nDimona mayor Beni Bitton said the stabber is a \"mentally ill man.\" He told Channel 10 TV that two of the victims worked for City Hall, and that passers-by quickly rushed to help the wounded Arabs and provided first aid.\nPlay Video CBSN Stone-throwing Palestinians shot by undercover Israeli forces Palestinians throwing rocks at Israeli forces fled after undercover agents opened fire. Meanwhile, Jerusalem's mayor is warning Israelis to walk ...\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"strongly condemned the harming of innocent Arabs.\" He said whoever deploys violence will be brought to justice.\nA Palestinian later stabbed a 14-year-old Israeli in Jerusalem, lightly wounding him before he was arrested, police said.\nIsraeli security forces braced themselves for more unrest Friday after days of Palestinian attacks that spread this week from beyond the flashpoint of violence at Jerusalem's holiest site and across the West Bank to Israeli cities.\nIsraeli police barred young Muslim men from the sacred Jerusalem site as a measure to ensure calm. Samri said men under 45 are barred from the Al-Aqsa mosque compound while women of all ages can enter.\nThe age limit has been set intermittently in an attempt to ensure peace at the site, as it's mostly younger Palestinians involved in the violence.\nSamri said police are on high alert.\nThe unrest began about three weeks ago as Palestinians repeatedly barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque and hurled rocks and firebombs at police.\nIt was fueled by Palestinian allegations that Israel plans to change the delicate arrangement at the hilltop compound, holy to Jews and Muslims. Israel has adamantly denied the allegations and accused Palestinian leaders of incitement.\nThe attacks were initially confined to east Jerusalem, site of the sacred compound, and the West Bank - both territories captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war and claimed by the Palestinians for their future state. But this past week the violence has spread to Tel Aviv, Afula and other Israeli cities.\nWhat began as Palestinians throwing rocks and firebombs at passing cars and police morphed into a deadly shooting and a rash of knife attacks where Palestinians stabbed Israeli civilians and soldiers in the streets. Four Palestinians were killed after carrying out attacks against Israelis since Saturday. Three Palestinian protesters were killed in clashes with Israeli forces in the West Bank during that time.\nThe Red Crescent medical service says over 500 Palestinians were injured in West Bank violent protests since the weekend including about 100 from live fire.\nThe attacks have shocked Israelis and sparked fears of a new Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. However Israeli officials have downplayed that possibility, saying this is the kind of violent spike Israel has faced periodically in recent decades.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the attacks a \"terror wave.\"\nIsrael has significantly beefed up security in response to the violence in Jerusalem, and on Thursday police set up metal detectors at the entrance to Israel's Old City.\nThe hilltop compound is a frequent flashpoint and its fate is a core issue at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the two biblical Jewish temples. Muslims revere it as the Noble Sanctuary, where they believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.\nNon-Muslim visitors are only allowed to enter the site at specific hours and are banned by police from praying there. Many Muslims view these visits as a provocation and accuse Jewish extremists of plotting to take over the site. Israel has promised to ensure the delicate arrangement at the site and insists it will not allow the status quo there to be changed.\nBut Palestinians say that in the last two months, there has been a new development where Israel has intermittently restricted some Muslims from the compound when Jews visit. Israel says this is to reduce friction, but Palestinians claim that Israel intends to establish Muslim-free Jewish visiting hours. The site is so sensitive that even rumors are enough to trigger violence there.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/09/ed5dce2a-0332-448d-9115-42299ac1a91b/thumbnail/220x140/db6f64b8b7c13233bbc4ef81a60a4574/cbsntensionsinisrael453175640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:33:53.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
