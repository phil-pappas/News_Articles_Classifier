Vincent D'Onofrio is cast in the key role for the network's new drama \" Emerald City \", which had been scrapped in 2014 but then brought back in development again earlier this year. D'Onofrio's version of the Wizard of Oz is described as \"the enigmatic leader of Emerald City. A man of science in a world of magic, he rules through inspiration, fear and a tenous accord with the grand witches.\" Dubbed a \"modern and dark re-imagining of\" the classic tale \"The Wizard of Oz\", the upcoming series itself follows 20-year-old Dorothy Gale who is swept up into the eye of a tornado and \"transported to another world, a mystical land in great peril, where an all-powerful Wizard has outlawed magic and rules over the many kingdoms. This is the fabled Land of Oz in a way you've never seen before - where lethal warriors roam, wicked witches plot in the shadows and a young girl from Kansas becomes the headstrong hero who holds the fate of their world in her hands.\" Adria Arjona, who has guest starred on \" Person of Interest \" and had a role on \" True Detective \" season 2, has been cast as Dorothy. David Schulner is tapped as showrunner in addition to serving as executive producer along with Shaun Cassidy. \"The Cell\" helmer Tarsem Singh will direct the drama, which has received a 10-episode, straight-to-series order from NBC. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:51:31.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
