I was enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly,\" the \"Titanic\" star said.\n\n\"I certainly don't eat raw bison liver on a regular basis. When you see the movie, you'll see my reaction to it, because Alejandro kept it in. It says it all. It was an instinctive reaction.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:45:44.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
