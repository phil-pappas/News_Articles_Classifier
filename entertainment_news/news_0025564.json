WILLIAMS / STAFF WRITER\nPublished: Oct. 9, 2015 Updated: Oct. 11, 2015 12:59 p.m. LAKE ELSINORE ROUNDABOUTS What: The City Council has approved the use of traffic roundabouts as part of the I-15/Railroad Canyon Road interchange project.\nWhere: Railroad Canyon Road at: Grape Street/Summerhill Drive; northbound exit/northbound entrance to I-15; southbound entrance/southbound exit; Casino Drive at Auto Center Drive; Mission Trail at Lakeshore Drive\nWhen: Early 2016 – project approval; March 2016-Sept. 2017 – final design and right-of-way acquisition; start construction – Nov. 2017; Finish construction – July 2019\nEstimated cost: $22.4 million to $28.5 million\nTotal project : Roundabout option plus Franklin Street interchange: $80 million to $86 million\nFor more than a decade, city and transportation officials have puzzled over what to do about the daily traffic quagmire on Railroad Canyon Road at I-15 in Lake Elsinore.\nWith the interchange’s congestion now reaching gridlock during rush hours, the City Council has decided to keep with the city’s slogan, Dream Extreme, and go with a daring, unconventional solution.\nRather than simply opt for added lanes and ramps, officials decided in late September to replace the signalized Railroad Canyon Road intersections straddling the freeway with traffic roundabouts.\nFive of them. All within half a mile.\n“I’ve had the fortune to have lived in Europe, where I’ve been through roundabouts, and they work,” City Councilman Brian Tisdale said in an interview. “I’m convinced they’re going to work (on Railroad Canyon).\n“What we have right now is not working. It’s not even coming close. I can’t even take my own exit home because it’s such a nightmare.”\nThe council rejected two more generic options, both involving additional connecting ramps. Although both would relieve congestion well into the future, studies indicate the roundabouts would move traffic better, be safer, cost less and look nicer.\n“This provides the immediate relief that we need and, from my perspective, this is going to beautify that part of our town,” Tisdale said.\nIn past public meetings to discuss the options, some residents expressed skepticism, especially because of the close spacing of the circles. Some critics pointed with disdain to other roundabouts in the region.\nRoundabout specialist Scott Ritchie told the City Council he is confident the formula will work on Railroad Canyon Road with careful engineering.\n“Some are made better than others, and a lot of those ... talked about have not been designed well,” Ritchie said. “Maximum entry speed should be about 20 mph. If you can enter at a speed higher than that, it’s not been designed right.”\nInstalling five roundabouts on one corridor is unique, but not unprecedented. Ritchie’s company designed five that the Arizona Department of Transportation built on a highway that runs through Clarkdale between Sedona and Jerome. Their success inspired Clarkdale officials to employ the concept in other projects, Mayor Doug Von Gausig said.\n“I think they’ve worked out really well,” Von Gausig said. “Safety and mobility through a roundabout is better than it is at a traffic light. You never have a T-bone accident at a roundabout. Traffic moves through them very smoothly, we’ve found.”\nRitchie said studies show roundabouts reduce injury accidents by 80 percent and fatalities by 90 percent over signalized intersections. Responses to accidents at roundabouts come more frequently from tow trucks than ambulances, he said.\nAs proposed, the roundabouts would constitute the first in a two-phase project intended to quell congestion at the junction during the next 25 years. The second phase consists of a new interchange to the north at Franklin Street, a project estimated to cost $57.6 million.\nThe roundabout option is placed at about $22.4 million. The next-cheapest alternative for the first phase – $22.6 million – involves installing hook ramps from the freeway to Grape Street among other improvements. The most expensive alternative – $33.7 million – would add hook ramps to Casino Drive as well as Grape Street.\nConstruction of the roundabouts could take 12-18 months, and the other alternatives would take a minimum of 18 months, officials said.\nThe city has $8.6 million available for the first phase, and officials hope that by choosing the innovative design, they can win a $20 million grant from a federal program. Construction could start by November 2017 and finish in mid-2019.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9690 or michaelwilliams@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:36:24.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
