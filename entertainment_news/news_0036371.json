Close Three exhibits at Yale link arts and architecture View of the exhibition “The Ceramic Presence in Modern Art” at the Yale University Art Gallery. (Courtesy Yale University Art Gallery) Published October 25. 2015 12:01AM AMY J. BARRY, Special to The Day \nYale University has staged three dynamic exhibitions on view that encompass fine art and architecture — and the conversations and collaborations that each inspires. The exhibitions and related events are all free and open to the public and all venues are within walking distance of each other. \nCeramic art comes into its own \nAlthough critically acclaimed during the early 20th-century studio-craft movement, ceramic art is just beginning to be recognized as an integral part of the history of modern and contemporary arts. “The Ceramic Presence in Modern Art at Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) features the work of 16 leading modern artists, who have chosen clay as their expressive medium. \nThe more than 80 diverse objects on view are mostly from the Linda Leonard Schlenger collection, as well as YUAG’s permanent collection. \nA unique aspect of the exhibit is that the ceramic works are juxtaposed with great paintings, sculptures and works on paper in the gallery spaces to put them in the context of fine 20th- and 21st-century art. It is also to highlight the fact that many of the ceramic artists were close friends and colleagues of artists working in other media, with whom they taught, exhibited and collaborated. \n“So what’s really important to us are the pairings, the groupings and the sidelines, so it’s about the individual works, but it’s also about the works in conversation,” says Sequoia Miller, co-curator of the exhibit, and Ph.D. candidate in the History of Art at Yale University. \nFor example, Miller points out that ceramicist Peter Voulkos and painter Franz Kline knew each other and both drew from Abstract Expressionist ideas about art making, while artists like ceramicist Kenneth Price and the painter and filmmaker Edward Ruscha responded to each other’s works as young artists in the emerging 1960s Los Angeles art scene. \nMiller notes that the artists also relate through their common uses of line, color, composition and other formal devices. \n“We have a real dynamic interchange between artists on the biographical level, on the level of some of the strategies they’re using in their works, and how they’re thinking about ‘What constitutes an artwork?’” he says. \nEnvisioning the world as a ‘City of 7 Billion’ \nThe fascinating exhibition “City of 7 Billion: A Constructed World” at the Yale School of Architecture (YSOA) gallery examines the world as one single urban entity as a means to consider the impact of population growth and resource consumption. The significance of “7 billion” is that it’s the number the world population reached in 2011 — expected to increase by another 2 billion by 2050. \nThe goal of the exhibit, which is the culmination of a two-year research project on global urbanization and sustainability, is “to bring together abstract information from across scientific, engineering and architectural communities, and make it accessible,” says researcher and exhibition curator Joyce Hsiang. “It makes the invisible visible, so it can be understood.” \nThis is achieved through an imposing 14-foot spherical model of the material infrastructures that physically shape and connect the world; a 52-foot-long city topography model that analyzes the implications of population growth over time; a 255-foot panorama that wraps around the entire gallery that explores urbanization across air, land and water; and 14 sectional core samples of the world that look at the vertical footprints of human activity, plus drawings, animations and historical text. \n“This constant back and forth between what we know and don’t know, as well as what is urbanized and un-urbanized, all becomes part of this larger question of the global city,” says Bimal Mendis, co-curator/researcher with Hsiang. \nMendis and Hsiang agree that the world has become the most important design problem of the 21st century and that as crises and opportunities transcend national borders, the necessity for architects and designers to operate on a global scale has never been more urgent. \n“City of 7 Billion” runs through Nov. 14 at YSOA gallery, 180 York St., New Haven. Hours and more information at www.architecture.yale.edu/exhibitions . \nHomages to the square \nJoseph Albers was not only one of the leading pioneers of 20th-century modernism, he was chairman of the department of design at Yale University School of Art from 1950 — when he and his wife Anni moved to Connecticut — until 1958. Albers is attributed with training a new generation of art teachers. In 1971, he became the first living artist to have a solo retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Albers died in New Haven in 1976. \n“Search Versus Re-Search: Josef Albers, Artist and Educator” at Yale School of Art explores the integration of Albers’ teaching and artistic methods in an exhibition of 18 paintings, prints, drawings and studies by Albers, alongside 60 student works derived from his classroom prompts. Also on view is an original short film, along with other documentary footage about the artist. \nReferring to Albers’ paintings and drawings of squares, for which he is so famous, Brenda Danilowitz, chief curator at The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation says, “You see a lot of paintings with squares, but in most renderings, they are always concentric, whereas Albers created this format where the square kind of dropped down, so it was a complicated set of proportions, and he made the square his own and also gave it a kind of gravitas, a feeling that it wasn’t exploding in space but had a form, and almost a horizon because you could sort of see through it. And so his manipulation of those naked squares was one of the genius results he arrived at.” \nThe hope of the exhibit, according to exhibition curator Anoka Faruqee, is “to open up your view of the range of what Albers did, the breadth of his interests from color to line to structure, (that) is really what the show is trying to present and what he brought to his teaching.” \n“The diversity of the work his students produced just shows how Albers believed in teaching principles, skills, ways of living, almost,” Danilowitz adds. “He gave them a kind of confidence to break out of accepted ideas, and so there was this great explosion of new forms, new ideas, and it wasn’t that they were doing what Albers had taught them in the classroom. This to him was just the basis, just the underlying impetus for them to take that and go out with confidence and do different things.” A Josef Albers color study for “Homage to the Square”; oil on blotting paper (Courtesy The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation/ARSNY) “Hawthorne,” 1959, painted metal by John Chamberlain in “The Ceramic Presence in Modern Art” at Yale University Art Gallery.
