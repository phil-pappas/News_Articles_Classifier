It was brilliant to see and a great sign of the man that he was able to put his own woes behind him and think of the team's achievement first.\"\nO'Connell will undergo surgery this week, according to a statement from the IRFU. Fingers crossed he'll be back on his feet in time to watch Ireland continue on in the tournament.\nMORE: Watch: Sexton, O'Connell, and Henshaw talk about sleeping arrangements and blue movies\nMORE: Watch: Sminky Shorts is back with an episode about tomorrow's rugby game against France\nMORE: The 10 Best Tweets During the Ireland V France Match", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/budget16?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/RTErugby/status/653878413992792064", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/1ofakind?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/UL/status/653887130561847296", "https://t.co/FCpz0rlSJJ", "https://twitter.com/BrianODriscoll/status/653871348213776384", "https://twitter.com/Munsterrugby/status/653867287317991424", "https://twitter.com/kendoherty1997/status/653883361660944384", "https://twitter.com/GavinCoffey/status/653868281137336324", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/gentleman?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThanksPaulie?src=hash", "http://t.co/VixJuejvPR", "https://twitter.com/Paul_OConnell", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/hero?src=hash", "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/world-cup/rugby-world-cup-rob-kearneys-emotional-tribute-to-ireland-captain-paul-oconnell-31604147.html", "http://t.co/xNmt6YqIpX", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Leader?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/UL", "https://twitter.com/gavreilly/status/653862189103714304", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IRLvFRA?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/IrishRugby", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/legend?src=hash", "https://t.co/8blR5e2tJp", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShoulderToShoulder?src=hash", "http://t.co/XHRL6jPsJd", "https://t.co/7S9J9H9OA3", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqlyy7XopG8", "https://twitter.com/RonanOGara10/status/653894902560989184", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/thankspaulie?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/IrishRugby/status/653859696441487360", "https://twitter.com/colmtobin/status/653248177949306880", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RWC2015?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:59:42.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
