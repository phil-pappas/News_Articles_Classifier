The Bachelorette contestant Drew Woolford. Channel 10 Cars For Sale \nBRISBANE bachelor Drew Woolford can have a laugh at himself after going on The Bachelorette. \nThe 31-year-old sleep technician was eliminated from the reality dating show tonight after his strong initial feelings for Sam Frost weren't reciprocated. \n\"I really do wear my heart on my sleeve; you can't create that kind of stuff,\" Woolford told APN. \n\"I also think I didn't get much of a chance to be my usual, silly self.\" \nWoolford spent much of his childhood in Harvey Bay and went to high school in Mountain Creek on the Sunshine Coast before moving to Coolangatta and eventually Brisbane. \nWhile some reality TV show contestants stay away from social media, Woolford doesn't mind a bit of a ribbing from viewers or reading about his supposed hair care routine in the media. \nHe stood out for his colourful entrance in the show's first episode when he arranged for an owl to land on his arm and for his long, straight locks. \n\"I've been called a 'poor woman's Jared Leto',\" he laughed. \n\"I think it's funny when people pay me out.\" \nA keen cyclist, Woolford applied for the show on a whim after seeing a late-night TV ad. He had no knowledge of Frost's Bachelor heartbreak of last year, when Bachelor Blake Garvey proposed to her and then dumped her for second runner-up Louise Pillidge. \n\"I was genuinely that ignorant (about the show),\" he said. \n\"I wasn't in there for any air time. I was simply there to meet a girl. I thought 'this will be interesting, and more fun than Tinder'.\" \nThe Bachelorette airs Wednesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm on Channel 10. channel 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:22:46.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
