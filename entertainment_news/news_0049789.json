Using your Uber app, you can now conveniently book someone to give you a piggyback to your next location.\nWe are redefining what it means to be picked up by an Uber. Uber Back can get you to work, the shops — or, if you want to get out on the track, and you don’t have a horse.”\nOf course, it wouldn’t be Uber without driver reviews — although the criteria has been tweaked.\nEnjoy the ride. Source: YouTube\nThen things get even more ridiculous, with the “next level” options of Uber Back Black — or a combination of all of the above.\n“Want that extra level of comfort? Try Uber Back Black — all the benefits of Uber Back, just slightly elevated,” Mander says.\nSilver service. Source: YouTube\n“If you’re really looking to go next level, why not ride an Uber Back Black, in the back of an Uber Black? This is going to change the way young people travel. Uber — we’ve got your back.”\nAll aboard the bros express. Source: YouTube\nWe’re not sure if rides with Uber Back or Uber Back Black are covered by insurance, but at least piggyback rides aren’t likely to put cabbies out of business.\nThe Collective Noun sketch comedy video team is made up of Sam Borgert, Zach Mander, Dom Fay and Michael Parente, who post new videos every Monday and Wednesday on their YouTube channel.\n Uber Back is the ultimate cheap ride", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/uber-piggyback-rides-are-the-new-black/story-fnkgde2y-1227554001048", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXlJITUIX1Y", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/000737-c6f96efc-68a2-11e5-8a7a-1db252b8f9e4.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/000987-c6af05f6-68a2-11e5-8a7a-1db252b8f9e4.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227553/999931-c6661526-68a2-11e5-8a7a-1db252b8f9e4.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:02:47.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
