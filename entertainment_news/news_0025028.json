I've done horrible things.\" \nCookie empathizes with her son by admitting that she has done some terrible things herself before telling him, \"God knows your heart.\" (Photo: Reuters/Phil McCarten) Cast member Trai Byers attends a screening of the television series \"Empire\" in Los Angeles, California, March 12, 2015.

Henson Praying to God for First Black Actress to Win Emmy for Best Lead Actress in Drama \nWhile the fifth episode of the second season partially focuses on Andre getting baptized, the actor who portrays the polarizing character spoke The Christian Post earlier this year about learning how to adapt to people's perception of the show. \nLast year, people viewed Trai Byers' character as a villain without knowing the depth of his story, which includes unresolved childhood issues, a bipolar disorder, and potentially being ousted from a music empire he helped turn into a success. \nByers, who was once on track to become a pastor, began to receive threats from fans who likened the actor to the character he portrays on television, which reminded him to exercise his faith. \n\"On social media and on the street people were saying, 'If I see Trai on the street, I'm going to slap him in the face.' Whether it's true or not, it's not a good thing to hear,\" Byers told CP. \"Ultimately, knowing God and reading the Word, it helps with patience with people, understanding, empathy and sympathy that they might not have that I have. If God gave it to me, why not exercise it?\" \nAfter firmly establishing his acting career by securing notable roles like student civil rights activist James Forman in \"Selma\" last year, followed by Andre Lyon in \"Empire,\" Byers insists there is a bigger picture being painted. \n\"It's working out for the purpose of His glory. If I weren't doing my job and saying, 'thank the Lord, God is good' everywhere I go, I think I would be doing a disservice to Him,\" Byers explained. \"Who knows how long this life would last. Wherever I am, whether I'm an actor, whether I'm a teacher or whatever ... I'm going to shout to the heavens until it's over because it's not about us, it's about Him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:03:23.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
