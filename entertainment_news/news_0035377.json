It was something that could be remedied if more personal stories were shared, he said.\n“It’s the only way I know that people can become aware of each other and understand that our desires –- from whatever culture we come from –- are very much the same,” said Keitel.\n“Experience is a pathway to awareness. The thought is that this exchange of experience might lead us all somewhere in life.”\nBIFF continues until October 10.\nArts & Entertainment Media Harvey Keitel Busan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:41:58.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
