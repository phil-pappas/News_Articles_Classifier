He was 70. \nBurgess became known for playing Jean Valjean in a long-running Canadian production of \"Les Miserables\" and singing \"O Canada\" at Toronto Maple Leafs hockey games. \nHis passing last week united friends from the theatre and sports worlds, including stage impresario David Mirvish and former NHLer Darryl Sitler who spoke of Burgess's generosity and dazzling voice. \nIn lieu of flowers, the Burgess family is requesting donations to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children in his name. \nBurgess is survived by his son Jesse, mother Dolly Burgess and siblings Wayne, Missy, Cathy, Bill, Patty, Julie and their families.
