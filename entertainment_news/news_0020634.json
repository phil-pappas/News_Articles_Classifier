Around the world many countries are slowly becoming more accustomed to the idea of marijuana as a non-harmful substance and it is high time policy in South Africa embraces it and ease the laws against the possession and consumption of marijuana. “Cannabis is to date a genetically pure plant, occurring globally, which offers massive medicinal, industrial, agricultural, ecological, and socio-economic benefits to the man on the street.” (George, 2015) In 2010 the UN World Drug Report states that between 119 million people to 224 million people above the age of 18 used marijuana. (UN, 2010)\nIn this paper I look to give reasons and recommendations for why government must review the law/policy of marijuana in South Africa. The cannabis industry is widespread in South Africa with many diverse users of it, the government should look for ways to take control and ownership of this natural plant instead of criminalising what has been proven to pose no more of a threat than smoking a cigarette does. I will explain in detail why I recommend that government starts the process of decriminalising cannabis and takes control of its use and production for medical and commercial purposes.\nI write this paper from the perspective of the South African political party: “The Dagga party of South Africa”. The main goal of this organisation is the legalisation of Marijuana in South Africa. It was formed in 2009 but failed to take part in the 2014 national elections because of shortage of funds. (Gaye, 2014) However, it is registered and recognised political party by the Independent Electoral Committee.\nOne might be tempted to outright dismiss the whole point of this paper but what one fails to do is look beyond the generalization that cannabis is a harmful drug. In South Africa there has never been a marijuana related death since forever, so why do people perceive it to be bad and why is it illegal? Unqualified reports and studies have led people to believe marijuana kill brain cells, this is an argument that scholars at Cambridge University does not accept: “our results indicate that there might be decrements in the ability to learn and remember new information in chronic users, whereas other cognitive abilities are unaffected.” (Grant, 2003)\nThe problem this paper aims to tackle is that government is losing out on potentially millions in gross domestic product by criminalising the possession and use of cannabis. Dagga was made illegal in South Africa in 1928 which distorted what had become as traditional to South Africans as biltong. (King, 2011) The longer government procrastinates on the legalisation of weed, the more will fall under the black market and that increases the amount of crime in the country as compared to if one could simply walk into a pharmacy or supermarket and purchase their desired or government regulated amount of weed over the counter. Marijuana currently is not treated like other substances, for instance, alcohol or cigarettes, the government cannot claim taxes on cannabis because they do not have structures in place like the SA breweries to regulate and control how much of the substance can be consumed, where, when and how.\nThe current policy in place against marijuana is the law in terms of the Illicit Drug(s) and Trafficking Act 140, of 1992, it prohibits the possession and dealing of cannabis in its entirety inside our borders (Steynvaart, 2014). This act means that anyone found in possession of marijuana is subject to prosecution to the full extent of the law. This law’s downfall is when people that use it for religious, medicinal and recreational activities get arrested and prosecuted. This policy or law has been successful when you look at it from the nonmodern and uninformed perspective that cannabis is bad for one’s health, but it has been discovered and proved that this is not the case. The policy has been unsuccessful in it’s main aim which was to deter people from using cannabis, instead we have seen the use of cannabis increase in south Africa and in 2009 the country was named Marijuana capital of the world, “South Africans are the world dagga smoking champions. A report from a UN agency shows that around eight percent of South Africans use the recreational drug, twice the global average of four percent” (Hartley, 2009).\nA solution that is currently on the table is for the government to make the possession and consumption of cannabis legal and then implement laissez faire and let cannabis circulate in the same way it has been, but now without the threat of prosecution. In my opinion this option would not be the best, even though it would cost the government no money, it would bring out a state of anarchy where every Tom, Dick and Harry can now sell cannabis. Also there would be the risk of children coming into contact with the substance.\nThe best solution is for the government to nationalise and take ownership of all sorts of marijuana in the country and then formalise and create a safe way of obtaining marijuana, be it from a pharmacy or supermarket or even over the counter. This now would allow the government to place a heavy levy much like sin tax on marijuana. The government could even invest money into research to find a way that you can control the high you get from smoking the plant.\nRecommendation\nThe legalisation of Marijuana has been long overdue. The continued criminalisation of it only results in higher figures of crime in the country when there is actually nothing that goes against or is in breach of the bill of rights in our country as marijuana does not harm others, barely even oneself. I recommend that the government does away with the prohibition of weed in our borders in the act 140, of 1992. The government need to introduce marijuana farming into the agricultural system and this will create employment, boost the gross domestic product and also at the same time make hundreds of thousands of people happy and high.\nReferences\n1.
