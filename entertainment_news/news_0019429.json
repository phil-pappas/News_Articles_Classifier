The city has just one country radio station — and it came on air two years ago after a 17-year drought. But Music City musicians are partnering with a nonprofit that provides music education in city schools to help boost music as a core subject. \nThis week, Nashville songwriter Liz Rose helped 19 students from the Bronx write an original tune they called \"Everybody's Perfect.\" \nThe students at Pelham (PEH'-lum) Gardens School in the Bronx are among 500 students in 15 different schools around the city to participate. They receive 10 lessons from musicians on how to write lyrics, and one class in each school has a videoconference session with a musician in Nashville. \nThe Nashville-New York connection is through Country Music Association Foundation, which brought the program together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:33:30.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
