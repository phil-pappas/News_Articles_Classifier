The new photos feature Zellweger with her fake baby bump and her on-screen love interest Colin Firth . Colin reprises his role as Mark Darcy in the third installment of \"Bridget Jones\" movie series. He was spotted on the set of the movie in front of a building near a park in London. He looked dapper wearing a navy blue suit with a matching electric blue shawl. In one of the photos, he's seen hugging a brunette. Meanwhile, Renee looked messy as a pregnant Bridget wearing a baggy dungarees over a plaid shirt with an oversized cardigan. In the story, Bridget should have gained around 30lbs, but it seems like the new film will feature a slimmer Bridget. Jones was engaged to be married to Darcy at the end of \" Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason \", but it is not clear whether the couple will end up marrying each other because Firth didn't use a wedding ring while filming the movie. While Hugh Grant 's Daniel Cleaver won't be back, the new film introduces a new character played by Patrick Dempsey . Sharon Maguire, who directed the original \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" in 2001, will return to direct the third film with a script she co-wrote with David Nicholls. \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" is expected to arrive in the U.S. in 2017. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Bridget Jones's Baby News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:35:12.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
