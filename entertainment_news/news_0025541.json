With his long blond locks, thick glasses and off-key singing, he wouldn’t fit the part anyway.\nEarlier this year, Stone released his third album and major label debut, “Radius,” which sees him doubling up on keeping it real — part of the reason he travels with an eight-piece live band, refusing to use recorded backing tracks on tour.\n“And good God, I would be fat and happy, and have way more money in my bank account if I did,” he said. “And my band, when I can afford it, has two horn players out with it as well. All those people are human beings with stomachs to feed and rent to pay. They cost a lot more than a MacBook Pro.”\n— Aidin Vaziri \nAllen Stone: 8 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22. $27.50.
