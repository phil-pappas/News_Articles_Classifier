He was classically trained and learned to love everything from symphonic, choral and folk music to big band and small combo jazz. \nOver the years, Nowak has had the privilege of performing with many wonderful musicians, mostly in the small jazz combo arena. He has entertained on cruise ships as well as in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. Before moving to Bangor, he could be seen occasionally singing with the Unified Jazz Ensemble in Annapolis, Md. He also has performed on several recordings, both as a vocalist and trumpeter. \nNowak’s passion is music from The Great American Song Book, which includes songs composed in the 1920s, ‘30s and ‘40s and recorded by artists such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Mel Torme and Ella Fitzgerald. He said he feels this era produced some of the most beautiful melodies and meaningful lyrics ever written, as popular today as when originally performed. He released two CDs: “Once More with Feeling,” on the Red Canoe label; and “Don't Hold Back.” \nDoors open at 4 p.m., and the dinner is served at 6 p.m. Dinner shows are $20 per person with a set menu, which can be checked out online; admission for just the performance is $10. The inn also has a weekly Tuesday Jazz Supper Club and other events; for more information, call 505-5231 or visit belfastbreezeinn.com . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
