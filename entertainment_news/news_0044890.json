It was written in 1940 by Welles' collaborator Herman Mankiewicz and is the earliest known existing draft of the classic movie. \nA second draft was snapped up for $25,600, but it was the third and final revised shooting script, which includes handwritten notes from Welles and is signed by most of the cast, which smashed auction estimates at $44,900. \nThe manuscripts were sold by a close friend of the filmmaker, who died in 1985. \nThe auction lots failed to generate as much interest as Welles' personal copy of the working draft script, which sold for a stunning $164,000 at Sotheby's last year. \nThe 1941 film is considered one of the the greatest pictures ever made by many critics, filmmakers and fans.
