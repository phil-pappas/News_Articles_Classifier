That's the way it goes in TWD -land.\nMichonne (Danai Gurira) puts her katana to use in The Walking Dead season 6 episode 3 'Thank You'. Photo: AMC \nSo, let's call them Ten Little Indians. Remember your nursery rhymes (or your Agatha Christie) and you'll know how this will likely turn out. \"And then there were none.\"\nAdvertisement Surely that can't be true? Rick is the centre of the show, so he's off limits. Glenn has been there since episode two, more adept at escaping than Houdini – hell, than James Bond even; I fully expect him to get out of his next tight spot by reaching into his pocket to reveal … a helicopter! And there's Michonne, who just kicks ass, then scythes it in half with that mighty katana of hers.\nSurely these three are indispensable? The others? Well, not so much.\n\"Thing is, they aren't all going to make it,\" Rick (Andrew Lincoln) tells Glenn (Steven Yeun) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) in an impromptu half-time huddle behind a beech tree.\nSure enough, even before the opening credits, one of them is gone (he was mouthy, he dissed Rick, we all know how that ends).\n\"You try to save them – you try – but if they can't keep up, you keep going,\" Rick continues. \"You have to. You make sure you get back.\"\nThe New Black Dude Whose Name We Don't Really Know Yet has overheard this (his name is Heath, for the record, though I don't reckon I've heard it spoken once, and he's played by Corey Hawkins, who played Dr Dre in Straight Outta Compton , which probably means he's gonna sample that shit and mix it up with some sick beats and put it out as a single just as soon as he gets back to Alexandria), and that means he's now firmly in the camp of Those Who Think Rick Is an Asshole Who Can't be Trusted.\nTo be fair, it's becoming a pretty crowded camp site.\nCue the first wave of zombies. In the scuffling, a big white dude (so expendable that imdb and the official TWD website neglect to mention the poor actor's name) gets bitten on the shoulder, and Scott (Kenric Green) injures his leg. Skinny white chick Annie (Beth Keener) had already twisted her ankle, so now we've got the walking wounded trying to outrun the walking dead.\n\nBig White Dude says of his bite: \"I know what it means.\" Well, yeah, we all know what it means, but this is interesting: he's a soon-to-be zombie with a shotgun. Do zombies know how to cock and shoot, or just bite and chew?\n\"Is it bad?\" Big White Dude asks Michonne.\n\"It's about what you'd expect,\" she says, somehow resisting the temptation to go all sashimi on his ass.\n\"I didn't expect this,\" he says. Clearly, he missed the first five seasons or he would have expected PRECISELY this.\nBig White Dude tells Michonne he's a newlywed (well you would, wouldn't you; I mean, she radiates empathy and a subtle understanding of the intricacies of human relationships, does Michonne. Hell, give that woman a bleeding hearts column. Give her an oozing brain one too while we're at it.)\nHis wife of three months is back in Alexandria. \"She made me more, more than I used to be,\" he says. \"But if I could make it back, I'd want to say goodbye. Tell her that finding her in all of this, that was everything.\"\nAt this point a betting man (or woman) might place a bundle on Big White Dude not getting back to say anything of the sort. If only you could find a bookie out here. Who's for bundling Tom Waterhouse into a car and dropping him in the woods outside Alexandria? Hey, form an orderly queue, you lot.\nAnyway, back on the road Daryl (Norman Reedus) decides he's had enough of leading the Zombie Pride March, and heads back to Alexandria to lend a hand.\nSomehow, Nicholas the Coward Who Has Maybe Come Good (Michael Traynor) has led the limping survivors to a town he's raided before. They take refuge in a pet store, where Michonne tells Dr Dre that their only hope of escape is to lead the zombies \"away from here\".\n\"Because that's been working so well lately,\" says Dre. Boo-yah! Take that, Rick Grimes and your crazy-ass scheme to make Alexandria safe from zombie attack by leading squillions of zombies past the front gate. \nMichonne looks daggers at him – no, she looks big Japanese swords at him – and tells him he has no idea what it's really like out there.\n\"I've been doing runs since the start,\" he shoots back. \"I know what it's like out there.\"\nOh, she's been waiting for this.\n\"Have you ever done things that make you feel afraid of yourself afterward? Have you ever been covered in so much blood that you don't know if it was yours or walkers' or your friends'? Huh?\"\nHe says nothing.\n\"Then you don't know,\" she says. Boo-yah back at you, bitch.\nRick, meanwhile, is out on the road, running to the RV that he plans to use to lure the zombies to … well, to somewhere else. I'm still with Rick, but I am definitely thinking about buying a tent and maybe heading out to that camp ground with all the other doubters if this carries on much longer.\nRick runs into some zombies and quickly dispenses with them but now there's a gash on his hand, caused by his hand hitting the knife that was poking out of the neck of one of the walkers. Can you contract zombie virus from a needle stick injury? Cripes.\nOutside the pet shop, a mob has started to swarm. Imagine the local Pets R Us if word went around on a Saturday morning that they were giving away free kittens to every eight year-old who bothered to rock up. That's what it's like. Only more orderly.\nElsewhere in town, Glenn and Nicholas have run into a dead end and clambered atop a dumpster. Beneath them, gasping faces and grasping hands reach up, looking both empty and desperate; it's like the mosh pit at a Slipknot concert and Nicholas looks like he's thinking about crowdsurfing his way to the bar.\n\nIn fact, he's thinking about his exit line. Not for the first time this episode, he blanks out. When he comes to he looks at Glenn and says \"Thank you\" – presumably for not abandoning him, for not killing him, for giving him a shot at redemption.\nAnd then he turns his pistol on himself and blows his brains out.\nAs he falls into the herd below, Nicholas drags Glenn down with him. It's horrible, like I-didn't-think-this-show-could-shock-me-any-more-but-yes-it-still-can horrible, and Glenn is torn to shreds.\nThere is no pocket helicopter.\nThere is no getting back to Maggie.\nThere is no more Glenn. Say it ain't so!\n\nMy heart is pounding. Is this the latest allegorical shift of TWD ? Is this the \"no one is indispensable\" lesson we've all been learning in the corporate realm for the past couple of decades made flesh and blood? Mostly blood.\nI'm sorry, it's just too real.\nBy episode's end, Rick has unloaded a machinegun on a gang of attacking Wolves, and the noise has drawn a horde of zombies to his RV, which (naturally) won't start. He may or may not be contaminated but he looks utterly stuffed.\nAnnie is gone, Big White Dude is gone, a couple of others whose names we barely even needed to learn are gone. Nicholas is gone and, most shocking of all, Glenn is gone too.\nAnd then there were four. For now.\nFollow Karl Quinn on Facebook: karl quinn writer \nOn twitter: @karlkwin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:44:28.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
