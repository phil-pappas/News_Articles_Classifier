Supply Pod uniquely delivers products themed around upcoming sci-fi releases and scientific events.\nThe first box is based on the real-life science behind Andy Weir's debut novel, The Martian, which inspired the upcoming movie starring Matt Damon about an astronaut stranded on Mars.\n\"We can't say exactly what will be in the box because the mystery is part of the fun! But it might include survival gear, astronaut essentials, engaging collectibles and much more.\"\nThere are two options available for purchase, and more details are available at https://mysterybox.outerplaces.com\nThe Essential Pod ($29.99 plus shipping, handling and tax) contains science and sci-fi items that would be great to have if stranded on Mars.\nThe Deluxe Pod ($39.99 plus shipping, handling and tax) contains all the items in the Essential Pod plus a paperback version of The Martian by Andy Weir, currently No. 1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list.\nIn addition, 50 Deluxe Pod customers could receive an autographed copy of The Martian.\nFor brands, Supply Pod offers a dynamic opportunity to engage and introduce their media properties and products beyond traditional retail and marketing programs to Outer Places' passionate community of sci-fi and science enthusiasts.\n\"We are incredibly excited to be working with Random House for our box themed around The Martian. Weir's story of survival on Mars is arguably one of the most realistic works of science fiction in years, a fact that's not wasted on our audience of avid science and sci-fi fans. The level of excitement around Ridley Scott's adaptation is massive, and we believe Supply Pod represents the perfect opportunity for the loyal fans of The Martian to engage with this story in a new way.\"â€”Kieran Dickson, editor of Outer Places\nThe company is rapidly expanding its list of partners and will be adding new boxes in the coming months.\nSupply Pods are currently only available to ship within the continental United States.\nOuter Places is founded by Michael Donovan, whose past accomplishments include creating the American Girl Place retail concept.\nFor more information, visit https://mysterybox.outerplaces.com\nFor media inquiries or general questions, please contact: supplypod (at) outerplaces (dot) com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9teXN0ZXJ5Ym94Lm91dGVycGxhY2VzLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:18:40.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
