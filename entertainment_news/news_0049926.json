It includes over 200,000 photos hand-picked from some of the world's most acclaimed photography agencies, bringing the number of stock elements Dissolve licenses to over 1 million.\n\"We're building a collection to serve the needs of our advertising and creative customers, who are looking for fresh, culturally relevant, lifestyle-oriented stock photos,\" says Aaron Booth , Dissolve's Director of Products. \"We'll be growing the collection steadily but very selectively, keeping the focus on quality, so buyers don't have to sift through page after page of irrelevant or dated images.\"\nStock photography is a natural complement to Dissolve's product mix. The company was founded by former senior employees of Getty Images, Corbis, and Adobe, who have extensive experience building and marketing stock-image libraries.\n\"With the addition of stock photography, Dissolve consolidates its position as a key resource for today's digital storyteller or graphic designer,\" says Patrick Lor , CEO of Dissolve. \"Our team has unparalleled experience building stock collections that become essential resources for creative work.\"\nThe collection launches with images selected from five well-established stock photo agencies: Hero Images, Blend Images, Image Source, Maskot Images, and Cultura. Every image is licensed under a flexible royalty-free agreement that allows unlimited reuse, and includes model and property releases. Images are priced at USD $49 , $299 , and $499 , depending on resolution.\nKey demographics pictured in the collection include families at home and at play, kids and teenagers at school, and seniors living healthy lifestyles. The collection also includes tens of thousands of up-to-date business images that reflect the way people dress and interact - with each other or through mobile devices. While the bulk of the collection features human models, sophisticated wildlife, nature, and scenic photography is also part of the mix. Find out more about the collections or browse them all at dissolve.com/photography .\nStock photography on Dissolve is offered via the existing website at dissolve.com through a simple, easy-to-use search interface. As with its footage offering, Dissolve also offers free research to photo customers who don't have time to search. The photo collection is also part of the Dissolve Priority™ program, a service that saves agencies time and effort by giving them fast image research, 30-day invoicing, and access to unwatermarked comps.\nAbout Dissolve\nDissolve licenses stock video clips for use in commercials, television shows, documentaries, and feature films, and licenses stock photography for use in design and creative work.
