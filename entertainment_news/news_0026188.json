While stopping by Sway In The Morning on SiriusXM's Shade 45 on Monday, October 19, the British beauty set the record straight on the swirling rumors. Miller was rumored to have special relationship with Pitt as they're working on a project together. He's the producer of her movie \" The Lost City of Z \". The cheating allegations were first reported by In Touch magazine which claimed that Angelina Jolie was \"consumed by jealousy\" over Pitt and Miller's professional relationship. When Miller was asked about the allegations, she laughed. \"The brilliant thing about that rumor is that yeah I haven't really read too much about it,\" the 33-year-old actress said of the rumors, before clarifying, \"So this is the truth about that, Brad Pitt is producing the movie that I just wrapped but I didn't see him, he's not been to the set.\" Miller then claimed the idea that she's dating her film's producer whom she met only twice was crazy. \"You know he's the producer of the film and I've met him twice - it's insane,\" she said. In addition to Miller, a source close to Jolie and Pitt had previously denied the affair rumors as saying that it \"never happened.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:24.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
