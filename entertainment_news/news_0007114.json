The movie, Singh's debut feature, is about a man who is obsessed with success until he sets on a journey to find his true fate through music. \nCo-producer Shaan Vyas described the work as \"a mainstream film in Bollywood with songs but without the cliches.\" \nExecutive programmer Kim Jiseok said the festival's organizers selected the Bollywood film hoping it would allow the audience to reflect on what South Korean society may have lost in its pursuit of wealth and success.
