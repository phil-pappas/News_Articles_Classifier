Mavis’ proud father Dracula (Adam Sandler) welcomes Jonathan’s nervous parents, Mike (Nick Offerman) and Linda (Megan Mullally), to his humble home for the nuptials, which pass without a hitch. Mavis falls pregnant and gives birth to an adorable son called Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) and the couple consider moving to California to raise their child among other humans. Dracula is devastated - he believes that any heir to the bloodline should be raised in Transylvania, surrounded by other monsters. As Dennis’ fifth birthday approaches, Dracula waits nervously for the boy’s first milk fang to sprout, which will be proof that he has vampire blood coursing through his veins. Hotel Transylvania 2 strikes the same jaunty tone as its predecessor, treading a linear narrative path so young audiences remain engaged by little Dennis’ rites of passage. \nRating: 3/5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:29:56.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
