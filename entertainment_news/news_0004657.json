He was detained by troopers in Vermont after Canadian officials said he'd be deported. \nQuaid and his wife, Evi, are wanted in Santa Barbara, California, to face felony vandalism charges filed in 2010 after they were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned. \nThe pair skipped several court appearances and went to Canada, where Evi Quaid was granted citizenship. Randy Quaid's bid for permanent residency was denied. \nQuaid is to appear in court Monday on a fugitive from justice charge. It wasn't immediately known if a hearing will be held for his wife. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:00:05.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
