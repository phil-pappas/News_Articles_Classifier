It shows that Murphy had elevated levels of both drugs in his system when he died at the Backwoods Camping and Music Festival in Stroud. The manner of death was listed as accidental. \nThe autopsy also noted \"excited delirium\" may have precipitated Murphy's death. \nThe Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation has been investigating Murphy's death as a possible homicide, and spokeswoman Jessica Brown said Tuesday the case \"remains open and active.\" \nThe OSBI says Murphy, of Stillwater, stopped breathing after being subdued and placed in handcuffs by security. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:48:07.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
