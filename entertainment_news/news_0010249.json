The fans placed a full-page ad in Billboard magazine to congratulate the four-piece on their upcoming album, \" Made in the A.M. \", and thank them for everything they'd done in the past five years. A part of \"#TilTheEndFanProject\", the ad was organized by three \"girls in our 20s from Brisbane, Australia.\" Coming up with the idea last May, they set up GoFundMe and PayPal accounts for fans worldwide to raise money for their plan. The ad is featured in the October 24 issue of the magazine. \"We'll be here long after the lights have dimmed and the screams have subsided. 'An artist is nothing without fans and a fan is nothing without an artist,' \" read the message written above four microphones with the 1D members' names below them. \"Thank you for everything.\" The ad didn't go unnoticed by the One Direction members. After learning of the sweet present from their fans, the boys immediately took to Twitter to thank them. You guys are amazing, can't believe you did this for us!! Thank you for all your incredible support pic.twitter.com/EMrWfKjIQJ — Liam (@Real_Liam_Payne) October 22, 2015 \"You guys are amazing, can't believe you did this for us!!
