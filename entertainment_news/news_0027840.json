It's not any secret, is it?\" \nHer remarks drew criticism from anti-crime campaigners and now veteran singer Stewart has waded into the row, insisting Hynde was wrong to suggest women can 'provoke' men into rape by the way they dress. \nHe tells British magazine Event, \"I think a woman should be able to do and wear what she wants without feeling that she's going to be attacked. I don't go along with that saying, 'She was asking for it.'
