And if there is a recording from 1945, when the Cubs last won the pennant, I'm not aware of it.\"\nHughes, who has put in 20 years and called more than 1,700 defeats, deserves the chance to deliver the historic call. If only the Cubs would cooperate.\nBut as Hughes mentioned in the seventh inning Tuesday night, they have not led for a moment in the series. The Game 3 dagger came on a 3-2 pitch from closer Jeurys Familia.\n\"And the payoff pitch … strike three called,\" Hughes said. \"The ballgame is over and the New York Mets take a three-games-to-none lead in the National League Championship Series.\"\nHughes' broadcast far exceeded the quality of the home team. Working on WBBM-AM 780 with analyst Ron Coomer, Hughes painted a picture the way Jacob deGrom painted the bottom edge of the strike zone.\nI always get a kick out of Hughes' description of what everyone is wearing — including home-plate umpire Ted Barrett and his \"black hat, black shoes.\"\n\"There's something about baseball on the radio that is still a marriage made in heaven,\" Hughes told me Monday. \"You would think in this age of video, baseball on radio would go by the wayside, but that's not the case. As testimony, look at broadcast fees, sponsorship and salaries … though not necessarily mine.\"\nHughes is not one to complain, but his pipes were rusty Monday, the result of insisting on an open-air booth in the Sunday night chill at Citi Field in New York — and not getting home to bed until 5 a.m.\nEarly Tuesday evening Hughes said, \"Boy, it is nice to be back home, isn't it?\"\nAnalysts love working with Hughes because he sets them up like a veteran point guard.\nAfter Dexter Fowler took a low called-third strike in the first, Hughes said: \"Take a look, Ron.\"\nCoomer responded: \"I agree with Dexter. (He's) 6-foot-5 and this pitch is below the knees. DeGrom got a break.\"\nBoth came to life when Kyle Schwarber lined one into the bleachers in the first.\nHughes' call: \"He hits a drive to left-center field … It's got a chance … GONE!\"\nCoomer: \"Can you say 'Welcome back to Wrigley'!?\"\nAn early visit to Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks by pitching coach Chris Bosio prompted Hughes to say: \"He notices something.\"\nSaid Coomer: \"If (Hendricks) makes mistakes up, it's going to be a long night.\"\nIt's a wonderful coincidence that Coomer and Ron Santo share a first name.\n\"Lots of fans have told me they like when they hear me say 'Ronnie' because it reminds them of Santo,\" Hughes said Monday. \"I think I called Keith Moreland 'Ron' or 'Ronnie' a few times over three years.\"\nYou could hear the joy in Hughes' voice Tuesday when he recounted the time Mets third baseman David Wright approached Santo to express his admiration.\n\"That's a rare gesture for a guy on the opposing team to do for an opposing broadcaster,\" Hughes said.\nCoomer was not the only other contributor to Tuesday's broadcast. Television play-by-play man Len Kasper subbed for Hughes in the fifth inning.\nKasper told a story about deGrom having broken a finger on his left hand while helping a neighbor in Florida castrate a calf in 2013.\nHughes couldn't resist a friendly jab, saying: \"More of a television story than a radio story, Len.\"\nKasper: \"We're trying to paint a picture here, Pat. I apologize for that … no more conversations about livestock the rest of the night, I promise.\"\nIt turned out to be a pleasant diversion on a night in which the Cubs could relate to that calf.\ntgreenstein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TeddyGreenstein\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Ron Santo New York Mets David Wright Jeurys Familia", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56270e21/turbine/ct-pat-hughes-greenstein-media-spt-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:27:08.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
