'Rudhramadevi' will hit the screens worldwide in Telugu and Hindi on Friday.\n\"The Tamil version will release on October 16. The film's Tamil producers Thenandal Films released Vijay-starrer 'Puli' last week and hence have pushed the release of 'Rudhramadevi' by a week as they feel both the films will eat into their box office returns,\" said a source from the film's unit.\nThenandal Films has confirmed via their Twitter page that the Tamil version of 'Rudhramadevi' will release on October 16. Directed by Gunasekar, the film chronicles the life of queen Rudhramadevi, one of the last rulers of Kakatiya dynasty. The film, said to be made on a budget of Rs.80 crore, features an ensemble cast of Prakash Raj, Allu Arjun, Rana Daggubati, Krishnam Raj and Vikramjeet Virk in important roles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:21:45.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
