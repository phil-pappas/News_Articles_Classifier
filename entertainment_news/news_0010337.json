Image 31 of 31 Take a look back the Texas RenFest of yore 1 / 31 Back to Gallery The 41 st annual Texas Renaissance Festival kicks off this weekend in Todd Mission, just north of Houston.\nThings have sure changed in Todd Mission over the decades, but the sense of whimsy has always remained. Looking back at old photos you will see that most things haven't changed. There are more tattoos and selfies now, though.\nThe festival is one of the biggest attractions in Texas in the fall and every year more people flock to it for food, performances and fun.\nRELATED: Texas Renaissance Festival announces a few new additions to its grounds, calendar for 2015\nThe festival has a long history of hosting acts before they hit the big time.\nThe comedy/magic duo Penn and Teller performed in the late '70s doing their juggling and fire-eating act, not too different from what they still do. The only difference is that Teller had more hair and Penn was a bit smaller. Actor and magician Harry Anderson of TV's \"Night Court\" also worked at the park mingling among patrons at one point.\nRELATED: RenFest 2015 food options include deep-fried nachos on a stick, other oddities\nWe're all still holding out for a \"Game of Thrones\" weekend at RenFest.\nFans will get a chance to make new memories when the festival opens up on Saturday, Oct. 10 with Oktoberfest Weekend and runs until Nov. 29 with its holiday weekend.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800254/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/16/6800258/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800242/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800222/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800224/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800245/8/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800220/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800244/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800249/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800245/8/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/16/6800256/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800229/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800228/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800255/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800248/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800226/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800221/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800247/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800225/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800242/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800253/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/16/6800258/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800224/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800218/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800223/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800253/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800241/12/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800222/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800221/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800248/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800217/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800218/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800240/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800229/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800249/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/16/6800256/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800252/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800244/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800251/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800251/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800227/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800252/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800255/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/16/6800257/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800250/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800227/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800217/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800246/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800225/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800240/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800247/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800246/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800254/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800228/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800250/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800223/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800241/12/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800220/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/16/6800257/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/74/15/6800226/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:28:40.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
