At least one of the boys, Harry Styles , has known for sure what he would do once they split up. In an interview with Beats 1 Radio, he shared, \"I'll go from singer to estate agent.\" He continued saying, \"I like the little ones (houses) because then you throw in 'it's romantic', which means it's tiny, while 'it's cute' means it has a window.\" Band mate Liam Payne then jokingly added that he was sketchy about going solo after a career advisor warned him against it.\"My career adviser said to me, 'put singing last as you're more likely to be a fireman',\" he revealed. As for Niall Horan , he stated, \"I'd like to be a DJ, I'll be raving it up.\" Previously, it has been reported that One Direction would be taking an extended hiatus next year. The band's producer has confirmed the hiatus would be started after the band completed their fifth studio album which is set to be released this fall. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:09.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
