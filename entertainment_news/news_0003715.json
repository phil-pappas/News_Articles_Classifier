The R&B superstar announced via Hot 97 on Tuesday, October 13 that the project, titled after his 1-year-old daughter, would arrive on Black Friday, November 27. Breezy has so far dropped \"Liquor\" and \"Zero\" as the first previews of the album. This marks his first LP since \" Fan of a Fan: The Album \", a collaboration with pal/frequent collaborator Tyga , came out back in February, and his first solo effort since last year's \" X \". In support of his new music, Breezy recently visited some North American cities for his \"One Hell of a Nite\" tour. He's scheduled to bring the trek to Australia later this year, but his plan is currently in jeopardy after the country's immigration minister Peter Dutton stated late last month that he's set to deny the 26-year-old crooner's visa application due to his past domestic violence conviction. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:09:39.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
