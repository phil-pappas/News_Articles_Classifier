All Rights Reserved.CBS ENTERTAINMENT Associated Press October 14, 2015 06:29 AM Most reality competitions on network television -- once the darlings of the networks -- are trying to find the bottom of their ratings. \"The Voice\" and \"Dancing with the Stars\" keep rolling downhill from the days when they topped the ratings charts, and \"American Idol\" set some sort of land speed record for a fall from grace. But the erosion has been much slower for \"Survivor,\" while its competitors on Wednesday nights have crashed. The result: In its 16th year -- and 31st season -- \"Survivor\" is back on top in the 8 p.m. time slot. Last week gave the show a clean win, its 9.2 million viewers defeating ABC's \"The Middle,\" its closest competition, by more than 1.5 million. \"Survivor\" once put up gigantic numbers; the finale of the first season drew more than 50 million viewers. But for several years now, \"Survivor\" has watched its numbers decline at a slower pace than most veteran shows, revealing a core audience that just won't go away. Network officials say efforts to keep the show and its \"characters\" fresh seem to be paying off. At any rate, viewers have demonstrated unique loyalty, giving the show staying power. The current season, \"Survivor: Cambodia -- Second Chances,\" in some ways is cashing in on that loyalty, bringing back players from its first two seasons in Kelly Wiglesworth, Jeff Varner and Kimmy Kappenberg. CBS's other elderly reality show, \"The Amazing Race,\" continues to do well in its second year on Friday nights. It is sitting a solid second to \"Last Man Standing\" and \"Dr. Ken\" at 8 p.m., hooking about 6 million viewers a week. In this case, \"Race\" does not seems to have particularly strong competition.
