The concert starts at 7 p.m. and is preceded by a potluck supper at 5:30 p.m. \nKindred Hearts comprises three 3 siblings, Brian Woodbury, Amy Woodbury Dillon and Diane Woodbury Briggs; and their cousin, who is more like a brother, Kevin Lasselle. The group began its journey in 1995 and through the years have gone through many changes. There have been times when the group has not traveled, but God continues to lead them back to this ministry time after time. They have released three CDs over the years and have just released a fourth, “All In Your Hands.” \nHaving grown up in church, the Hearts’ music has been influenced by many gospel genres, but their family blend of harmonies is rooted in traditional Southern Gospel. Their style encompasses a mix of great Southern Gospel classics, traditional and contemporary worship, along with original compositions that minister to young and old alike. Their recent project features mostly songs written by group members. Their concert mix includes keyboard, bass guitar and acoustic guitar, and flexibility allows them to do a wide variety of concert formats. \nKindred Hearts’ mission is a simple one, to spread the Gospel message through song and word of testimony — building the Kingdom of God one life at a time. The church is located at 41 Old Route 1. For more information, call 446-3288. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
