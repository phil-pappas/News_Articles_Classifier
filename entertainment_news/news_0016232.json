The perpetual school boy had more than 40,000 screaming fans fixed to his every move at the band’s Sept. 8 concert. In a flash, Young dropped to floor, convulsing and kicking as he simultaneously scorched the fretboard of his guitar during the closing moments of the anthemic “Let There Be Rock.” Confetti guns erupted from all sides as Young was lifted above an adoring crowd. As seemingly endless red and white scraps of paper cascaded down on the frantic audience, tears welled up in the eyes of Kevin and Pat Vargo. It was just the sort of thing their father and husband, John, would’ve loved. BLUE-COLLAR MUSIC John Vargo was a blue-collar family man. A retired officer of the Hills and Dales Police Department, Vargo liked his music to reflect the way he lived life — working class. “He loved to watch musicians,” said Kevin, a Canton native and 2010 Perry High School graduate. “He was real into musicians who were all about the music, giving back to the fans and putting on a good show. That’s where AC/DC struck with him.” On the weekend of June 13, John was noticeably under the weather. At first, he and his family didn’t think it was anything more than the flu. But later that Saturday, he collapsed and was rushed to Aultman Hospital. Early Sunday morning, John passed away at the age of 56, the victim of a stroke. A FATHER’S GOAL John was born and raised in Cleveland in a home where Kevin said, “Things didn’t always go their way.” “He had a rough childhood. He never really had a father around.” John later attended the University of Akron, and it was there he would meet the love of his life, Pat. “We worked in the cafeteria together,” Pat explained. “He was always so friendly. He approached me many times just to say hello and ask me about my day. He always liked to tell the story that I burnt my hand on a pie when he asked me out. I was just so excited to go out with him.” John and Pat married in September 1983. They moved to Canton and had two sons, Brian and Kevin. “It was his goal to be the best dad he could possibly be,” Kevin said. “So for him to be able to do things like go to concerts with us, or to Indians games, that meant more to him than anything.” Page 2 of 3 - FAMILY TRADITION A week after John passed, the Vargo family struggled to make sense of things. The calling hours and funeral had been a whirlwind, but according to Kevin, went “as good as it possibly could have gone.” Kevin has since moved back home to Canton from Cleveland. Being close to one another has helped the family cope. Also aiding Kevin through the initial shock of John’s death was their shared love of music. “Classic rock really connects me to him,” Kevin said. “I was laying in bed one night, and I started thinking about something special we could do to honor him. I got up and started looking up classic rock concerts that were coming to the area. As soon as I saw that AC/DC was coming to Detroit two days before his birthday, I said, ‘That’s gotta be it.’” Music is the base for some of Kevin’s fondest memories of his father. “He used to play ‘Mr. Roboto’ by Styx on the stereo in our house and crank it way up,” Kevin said. “I couldn’t have been any older than 5 or 6, but he would blast that song, and I would literally run up and down the halls.” When John drove his sons to school or football practices, the radio never strayed from classic rock. When they ate dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings, it was John selecting rock songs from the jukebox. “It was ingrained in me to listen to it,” Kevin said. “When I was in high school, I really started to listen to classic rock on my own, and it became my favorite,” Kevin said. “Once I was into it and knew it, I was able to talk to him more about it. One of his joys was his knowledge of music and being able to pass it on to me.” IN JOHN’S HONOR A wave of emotions came over Kevin and Pat on the three-and-a-half-hour ride to Detroit. John had never seen AC/DC in concert, but he practically wore out the concert DVD of the band that Kevin had given to him as a Christmas gift a few years prior. “Back In Black” was his favorite AC/DC album, and when Kevin played high school football, the team ran onto the field to “Hells Bells” as John worked on the sideline chain gang. “He would’ve killed to see them,” Kevin said. “We went through a lot of unsaid things on the way. We both knew what we were both feeling. She really wanted to do it, because she knew how much it would mean to him. I wanted to do it because I love AC/DC, and so did my dad.” Page 3 of 3 - Pat said John would’ve been blown away by the gesture. “I know how touched my husband would be that his youngest son went to all this trouble, and that we went to something that meant so much to him,” she said. “While I was sad, I was also actually happy, because I knew we were doing something to honor John.” When Kevin and Pat arrived at the show, the view from their initial seats was impeded by a column. In a twist of what some might call divine fate, their seats were upgraded to the floor, some hundred yards closer to the stage than where they would’ve initially experienced the show. “We got our seats upgraded, and I was thinking of my dad the whole time,” Kevin said. “When the confetti came down, I was looking up, and I could just feel him there. It felt good. I grabbed a handful of that confetti and took it to his grave just to kind of bring a little piece of that home to him.” ‘THE BEST DAD HE COULD BE’ Two days after the AC/DC show, the family again honored John by attending a Cleveland Indians game together — Brian’s idea. “For my dad and I, music was our No. 1 bond,” Kevin said. “For my dad and my brother, it was sports.” Pat cherished both experiences. “It was a very emotional few days, but it was wonderful for family to be together,” she said. The days often are still difficult for the Vargo family as it experiences milestones and holidays for the first time without John. On Father’s Day, the family gathered around John’s grave site and listened to the Indians capture a walk-off win. Pat and John also would’ve celebrated 32 years of marriage last month. Coincidentally, John had been working as a security guard at Aultman Hospital. In his final hours, he was surrounded by not only family, but numerous friends and co-workers. Kevin said his father would’ve been touched at the outpouring of support, confirmation that John achieved his goal. “He ended up ultimately doing exactly what he wanted to do in life,” Kevin said. “Which was be the best dad he could be.” Reach B.J. at 330-580-8314 or bj.lisko @cantonrep.com On Twitter: @BLiskoREP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:41:29.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
