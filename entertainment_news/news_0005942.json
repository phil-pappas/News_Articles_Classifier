Numbers have not and likely won't be released for just how many Netflix subscribers streamed the film this weekend, but the theatrical numbers are not impressive. \"Beasts of No Nation\" brought in $50,699 from the 31 locations for a $1,635 per-theater average. Paul Dergarabedian , senior media analyst for box office tracker Rentrak, says the film was \"more of a test case scenario\" and \"was going to have a rough go in theaters anyway.\" Bleecker Street handled the theatrical release. The film cost $6 million to produce. Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:57:56.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
