(Photo: PTI) New Delhi: Making a strong pitch for handing over Delhi police control to city government, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday sought a meeting with the Prime Minister and Lt Governor in the wake of gangrape of two minor girls here.\nThe Chief Minister hit out at Delhi police saying it had \"completely failed\" to provide safety to the citizens, while urging PM Narendra Modi to \"either act himself\" or give AAP government the authority over law and order in the capital.\n\"PM sir, give control of delhi police to del govt for one year. If situation does not improve, take it back. Seeking time to meet LG n PM to discuss women safety in Delhi,\" he said in a series of tweets.\nPM Modi shud either himslf act or give control over Delhi police n public order to elected govt of delhi या खुद करो या दूसरों को करने दो\n— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) October 17, 2015\nSeeking time to meet LG n PM to discuss women safety in Delhi\n— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) October 17, 2015 PM sir, give control of delhi police to del govt for one year. If situation does not improve, take it back\n— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) October 17, 2015 In a major embarrassment for the city, two minors were brutally gangraped in the capital yesterday, incidents which come close on the heels of the rape of a four-year-old girl in northwest Delhi last week.\nKejriwal visited the hospitals where the victims were being treated and said that his government has the requisite funds to take over the control of police and provide security.\n\"The Central government is saying they don't have money to spend on Delhi police which has 16,000 vacancies. Then why are they keeping the police under them? Give us the control of Delhi Police. We have the funds and we are ready to provide security to the citizens of Delhi,\" he told media.\nTaking a grim view of the cases, he said, \"Repeated rape of minors is shameful and worrying. Delhi Police has completely failed to provide safety. What is the PM and his LG doing?\"\nKejriwal said that Modi is \"answerable\" if he wants police to be under Centre's control and requested him to meet Jung, who he said, was more keen on \"interfering in the AAP government's work\".\n\"The only task left with LG and Delhi Police is to interfere in our work. Rather they should focus on the safety and security of women in the capital,\" he added.\nAAP has been at loggerheads with Delhi Police over a number of issues, with the party accusing the force of bias against it on several occasions.\nPages 1 2 next › last » Tags: Delhi minor gangrape Arvind Kejriwal Delhi Police Narendra Modi nation Also Read Rajnath Singh assures all help to flood-hit Assam No big singers for Dandiya Government may consider any decision on land bill after Bihar polls Centre urged for CBI probe", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/655297275002945536", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/655297937837174784", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kejriwal%20modi_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/kejriwal%20modi_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151017/nation-current-affairs/article/act-or-hand-over-delhi-police-us-arvind-kejriwal-narendra-modi", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151017/nation-current-affairs/article/act-or-hand-over-delhi-police-us-arvind-kejriwal-narendra-modi", "https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/655296814606712832", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:08:45.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
