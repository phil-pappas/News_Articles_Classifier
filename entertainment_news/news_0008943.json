Here are 10 of the most hilariously scathing film reviews by top critics.\nNorth (1994) \nAdvertisement \"I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\"\nRoger Ebert 's scathing review of the Rob Reiner-directed film has cemented its place in the annals of movie critic history. The legendary film critic gave North zero stars, labelling it the worst film of 1994.\nNorth  was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards (a.k.a. the Razzies), which recognises the worst in film each year. It has a 15 per cent critics' approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes ' 'Tomatometre'.\nMovie 43 (2013) \n\"There's just one use for  Movie 43 , apart from it being ground into the landfill that it deserves to become sooner rather than later. It provides me with a handy new answer to a question I'm often asked: 'What's the worst film you've ever seen?'\"\nToronto Star reviewer  Peter Howell , went on to conclude his review with the line: \"I give Movie 43 zero stars as not just a critical rating, but also as a public service.\"\nThe Peter Farrelly comedy, which stars a long list of famous actors including Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Naomi Watts, Richard Gere, and several others, was labelled by various critics as \"the worst film ever made\". \nKate Winslet in a scene from Movie 43.   \nGigli (2003) \n\"After the schadenfreudian thrill of watching beautiful people humiliate themselves wears off, it has the same annihilating effect on your will to live.\"\nIt starred the hottest Hollywood couple of the moment, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez - but like the ill-fated 'Bennifer',  Gigli  was nothing less than a disaster, as  Newsweek 's  Jeff Giles so eloquently observed.\nNot only was Martin Brest-directed film a failure with the critics, it was also one of biggest box office bombs of all time, costing $54 million to make but grossing only $6 million. It has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 6 per cent and won seven Razzies (including the worst comedy in 25 years).\nGigli - starred a hot couple, but was an epic fail.\nArmageddon (1998) \n\"The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out.\"\nArmageddon received mostly negative reviews from critics, but none seemed to take exception with the film more so than Roger Ebert , who went on to list it as the worst movie on 1998 (closely followed by the Spice Girls' movie Spice World ).\nDespite the critics' reviews, the Michael Bay film was a box office hit, grossing $553.7 million worldwide. It has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39 per cent.\nBruce Willis and Will Patton in Armageddon .\nBattlefield Earth (2000) \n\"A million monkeys with a million crayons would be hard-pressed in a million years to create anything as cretinous as  Battlefield Earth .\"\nRita Kempley of the Washington Post was one of several critics who lambasted the film, which us based upon the 1982 novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and stars John Travolta as a dreadlocked alien.\nWith a Rotten Tomatoes rating of just 3 per cent,  Battlefield Earth  frequently appears on lists of worst movies. It won seven awards at the 2000 Razzies, as well as the award for worst drama in 25 years and the (not so) prestigious Worst Picture of the Decade. It held the record for most Razzies won by a single film until Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill came along. Which leads us to our next stinker ...\nJohn Travolta starred in Battlefield Earth , which held the record for most Razzies until Jack and Jill came along.

He's afflicted with the belief that we can't get enough of him.\"\nThe Adam Sandler film was co-written and produced by Adam Sandler, who stars as both Jack and Jill (Adam Sandler in drag). Adam Sandler.  SMH 's own Sandra Hall said it best.\nAs mentioned above, Jack and Jill swept the Razzies, winning ten awards. Heavily panned by critics, it has a measly 3 per cent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and continues to feature on several worst movie lists. Adam Sandler.\nAdam Sandler, and Adam Sandler in Jack and Jill .\nAloha (2015) \"Aloha isn't horrible, but it does have a pitiable odour about it, like a dog that's sat too long on the beach.\"\nA rom-com starring Emma Stone, Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams doesn't sound so bad. But, as  New York  Daily News reviewer Joe Neumaier  wrote, Cameron Crowe's latest film was \"meh\". \nAloha  was under fire before it even hit the big screen, with the public questioning why a white actress (Stone) was cast as a one-quarter Hawaiian, one-quarter Chinese character. And when it did hit cinemas, the reviews weren't much better. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film 19 per cent, describing it as \"meandering and insubstantial\". \nBradley Cooper, left, and Emma Stone in Aloha .\nStar Wars: Revenge of the Sith (2005) \n\"It marks a distinct improvement on the last two episodes, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones . True, but only in the same way that dying from natural causes is preferable to crucifixion.\"\nThe Revenge of the Sith was generally well-received by critics, scoring an impressive 80 per cent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes . But this comment from The New Yorker 's Anthony Lane was too good not to include.\nBut now onto a less successful film from George Lucas ...\nStars Wars III - Revenge of the Sith : Better than the previous two episodes, just.\nHoward the Duck (1986) \n\"Toward the end, someone remembers that the film is a narrative medium and throws in a shard of a story line.\"\nWidely considered Lucasfilm's biggest bomb, Howard the Duck , based on the Marvel comic, was heavily panned by critics upon release. Among them, Chicago Tribune reviewer Dave Kehr , who quips that \"Howard is about as lovable as a dishwasher\".\nThis is another film that was chucked in the \"worst ever\" basket by many. There are rumours that two Universal production heads got into a fistfight, arguing over who was to blame for giving the failed film the green light. It won four Razzie Awards in 1987 and rates 14 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes .\nHoward The Duck .\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2010) \n\"If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.\"\nOne more classic line from the King of Scathing Reviews Roger Ebert , who gave the Transformers sequel just one star out of four. Director Michael Bay himself admitted the movie was \"crap\", while lead actor Shia LaBeouf said the film became \"too big\".\nIt was nominated for seven Razzie awards, winning three. It has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 19 per cent.\nMegan Fox and Shia LaBeou are once again caught up in a battle in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:14:57.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
