This is a man-writes-dog story.\nIt began more than 20 years ago, on a day the famous playwright A.R. Gurney (\"Love Letters,\" \"The Cocktail Hour\") was frustrated.\n\"I was trying to write something, and it was going nowhere,\" he recalled in a phone conversation last week. \"So, I just picked up the newspaper and I saw an ad for a black Labrador puppy.\" Gurney, who was living in Roxbury, Conn., had his interest piqued and went to see the animal. \"If you know Labs, it was just cute and friendly.\"\nHe bought it, and when his wife came home, he said, \"I've got a surprise!\"\nAnd Mrs. Gurney's reaction?\n\"She exploded.\"\nA light bulb went on in the writer's head.\n\"It was,\" he said, \"like the dog was the other woman. I thought maybe that would make a good play.\"\nSo, inspired to fictionalize a real-life tale, he sat down and wrote \"Sylvia,\" a comedy about a stray dog (played by an actress) who's found in the park and taken home by Greg, a married man going through a midlife crisis and thus emotionally needy. He finds that his wife, Kate, is none too happy to welcome an animal into their home. Call it an interspecies triangle.\nThe comedy debuted off-Broadway in 1995, with Sarah Jessica Parker portraying Sylvia, a dog who talks, and it became a hit.\nNow it's ascending to Broadway for the first time. Currently in previews, it opens Oct. 27 at the Cort Theatre.\nAnnaleigh Ashford, who won a Tony last season for \"You Can't Take It With You,\" plays Sylvia, with Matthew Broderick (Parker's husband, of course) as Greg and Julie White, a Tony nominee last season for \"Airline Highway,\" as Kate.\nGurney said it was very difficult to get the play an initial production in the mid-'90s, with stage companies unwilling to risk the potential blowback of having a woman presented as a dog.\n\"I heard, 'It may be a good play, but we can't do it,' \" he said. \"Theaters didn't want to touch it. Finally, Lynne Meadow [artistic director at the Manhattan Theatre Club] said that, although she didn't care for dogs, she liked the play and would present it.\"\nHe credits its arrival on Broadway to the persistence of lead producer Jeffrey Richards.\n\"He just loves his dogs,\" said Gurney, \"and I think that made him like the play. We couldn't cast it for a year or two, but he stayed with it. He stuck to his guns; other producers would have dropped it.\" \nGurney, known universally as \"Pete\" — A.R. stands for Albert Ramsdell — was teaching humanities at MIT when he made his first big splash as a playwright, in 1982, with \"The Dining Room,\" a multi-scene play depicting different aspects of WASP family life.\nBecause of that drama and subsequent plays that charted the decline of a quintessentially \"American\" culture, with all its flaws and virtues, he became labeled as a chronicler of upper-middle-class white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.\n\"At first I thought that was limiting me, putting me into a corner,\" he said. \"It was at the heart of so many of my reviews. But then I realized that's what I was. I was writing about what I knew, my own culture,\" said Gurney, who comes from an old Buffalo family.\nOver the years, that identification has largely faded as he's written many, many plays on a variety of subjects. At 84, he remains remarkably prolific, with a new work being produced almost every season.\n\"I'm still trying,\" he said. \"Writing plays is what I do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:23:39.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
