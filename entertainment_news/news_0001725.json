With the help of Shockwave Studios in Akron, this Ohio team of musical resolution has anxiously set an official release date for October 4th 2015 which is the same day as the 500 Plates dinner and video documentary debut. 500 Plates will bring together 500 Akronites from each of Akron's 22 neighborhoods for a shared meal around one 500 foot-long table outside on a temporarily closed section of the Innerbelt Highway. The social event is showcasing stories and favorite household recipes from one resident in each neighborhood and of course Max is one of those residents. The Mad Max Six Pack 12 track ensemble is said to be Maxheat’s favorite audio project out of the 20 mixtapes and original albums he has organized, produced, mixed and mastered since 2001. “We used a few outside up and coming producers on this and Nujam got executive creative control. The combination freed me up to test my performance and technique a lot more and it gave me more time to hit that sweet spot. When we stream it live worldwide online, people are gonna get to see why it’s Maxheat,” stated the WZIP FM alumni. Access to the live album VIP screening will be available free through Maxheat.com. Max is no rookie. As stated by 101 Distribution in AZ, \"George Clinton tripped over a Prince string part while on the way to a meeting with Tu Pac, Devo and the Tubes. But, it's definitely your own thing cuz. Clearly, there are East and West coast elements in your sound and vocal style, yet you've created your own thing here. C'mon with it. Bring it on.\" - 101 Distribution, Phoenix. The Online event is sponsored by the Pro Flow Radio Show and the online VIP screening will be free to the public starting Sept. 27th 2015 at http://MadMax.Maxheat.com or http://SixPack.Maxheat.com.
