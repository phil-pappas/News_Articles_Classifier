Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.\"\n-- Ephesians 4:26-27 (NIV)\nWhen was the last time you were angry? I mean really mad at something or someone?\nMaybe someone cut you off in traffic yesterday or today and it made you mad. Or was it the sarcastic remark someone said that distressed you? Perhaps it's just a culmination of little things that keep piling up that eventually caused you to explode.\nAnger -- what is it? It's a normal response we have when we perceive our worth and value has been threatened. However, the feeling of anger isn't a sin; it's how we react to that feeling that can result in a sinful act. When our rage causes us to harm someone or ourselves, we have carried it too far.\nThere is a saying, \"Anger is one step from danger.\" Scripture instructs us not to allow the sun to go down without acknowledging our anger and decide how to resolve it or let it go. God knows the longer we stay angry, the more destructive it becomes.\nThere are a few instances in Scripture where Jesus displayed anger. But he didn't harm anyone or remain that way. Anger used constructively can motivate us to stand up for a righteous cause and make a difference.\nRemaining in the emotion of anger only hurts us. If we poured acid in a container, over a period of time it would erode and eat away at the container. Anger eats away at our souls and robs us of peace and joy. It can also cause us to bring on many destructive consequences when taken in our own hands.\nAs a nurse, I learned that many stress-related diseases are brought on by chronic, unmanaged anger. Stomach disorders, headaches, chronic muscle aches and pains, jaw problems and teeth grinding can be some of the ways anger manifests itself in our physical bodies.\nSometimes we can stay angry for long periods of time because we are so used to being angry that we don't recognize we are feeling that way. Noticing when we become angry and the types of things that trigger our anger can help us manage it properly. Choosing to forgive rather than trying to collect for a wrong done to us can set us free from the destructive results anger can cause.\nOur daily issues demand us to take charge of our emotional lives. Asking God to heal our hurts and strengthen us can lead us to a healthier, happier lifestyle.\nâ€¢ Annettee Budzban is Christian author, speaker, life coach and nurse.
