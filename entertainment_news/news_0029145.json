It's unclear whether it'd be a prequel, sequel or a reboot, but word is the network wants a big budget hit for when \"Game of Thrones\" ends and something to help compete with the growing flood of superhero TV shows, including Netflix's \"Daredevil,\" The CW's \"Arrow,\" CBS' \"Supergirl,\" Fox's \"Gotham\" and ABC's \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"\nGreen Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong's son is making music that sounds a lot like, well, Green Day. Jakob Armstrong, 16, has signed with Burger Records (the same label that BJA's other son Joey, a drummer, is signed to with band Swmrs) under his solo moniker, Jakob Danger. He's released a handful of tracks that NME describes as angst-filled grunge punk rock, similar to Green Day (and Sweet Children) in the late '80s and early '90s.\nTV's musical breakout hit \"Empire\" could get a spinoff series as early as next year, according to Fox TV Group co-CEO Dana Walden. \"If there's a character... that feels original enough, has enough momentum and enough of a storytelling engine, we will definitely look to spin 'Empire' off for next season,\" she said. Creator Lee Daniels already said last month that another series based on the hip-hop drama would happen, possibly as a prequel about Taraji P. Henson's character Cookie Lyon.\n» Read more at the Daily Mail .\nAnd Syracuse University alumnus Aaron Sorkin thinks everyone's too mean these days. \"I am dismayed at how entertained we have become at the expense of others. It doesn't speak well of us, and it's gotten much, much worse, obviously, with social media,\" the screenwriter complained while promoting his new \"Steve Jobs\" movie. \"It feels to me like a lot of people talking and nobody listening. It's just a little quippy for me.\" Then Sorkin admits he's \"got a lot of nerve\" to call anything quippy.\n» Read more at The New York Times .\nMore Buzz:\n» Alec Baldwin blasts Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump for 'BS warmongering' ( THR )\n» RL Grime drops festival-ready remix of The Weeknd's 'The Hills' ( Billboard )\n» Ian Somerhalder gets naked in 'Vampire Diaries' teaser video ( NY Daily News )\n» Tori Spelling says she slept with two 'Beverly Hills, 90210' co-stars ( Too Fab )\n» Mira Sorvino meets (and apologizes to) the real inventor of Post-Its ( Huff Post )\n» John Gotti's grandson marries in NY ceremony worthy of 'The Godfather' ( DM )\n» 'Terminator' sequels on hold indefinitely despite 'Genisys' success ( SlashFilm )\n» Video: Chris Young, Brad Paisley cover Eric Clapton's 'Change the World' ( RS )\n» O.J.
