TV series is based on Tavis Smiley's book 'Before You Judge Me: The Triumph and Tragedy of Michael Jackson's Last Days'. \nFans will be able to go into the last weeks of Michael Jackson 's life on a TV series. Author and talk show host Tavis Smiley signed an exclusive pod deal to develop a scripted series based on two of his books for Warner Bros. Television. One of the books, titled \"Before You Judge Me: The Triumph and Tragedy of Michael Jackson's Last Days\", recounts the final 16 weeks in the life of the legendary pop music superstar. It will \"examine the soaring highs and deep lows faced by the late pop star - his constant hunt for privacy in a life that was more public than almost any other, and the pressures he endured as someone whose fame made him socially fragile and almost unable to live.\" The book hits the shelves in June 2016. Jackson died on June 25, 2009 of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication. He was rehearsing for a farewell tour \" This Is It \" during the final weeks of his life. A concert film documenting the rehearsals was released following his death and broke box office records. The other book, \"My Journey with Maya\", tells of Smiley's 28-year friendship with author and civil rights hero Maya Angelou. The book is being adapted into a stage play as well by Smiley and director Kenny Leon. The deal came after Warner Bros. acquired the TV rights to Smiley's other book, \"Death of a King: The Real Story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Final Year\". The projects will be produced through the Smiley Group Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television or Warner Horizon Television. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:21:39.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
