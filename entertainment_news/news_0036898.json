Photo: BBC \nSomeone pop the Bolly and get the press release out ... the long-promised film version of the iconic media comedy Absolutely Fabulous is finally in production.\nThe film will reunite the hit TV series' two stars â€“ frantic London public relations executive Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) and her loyal, leeching best friend, magazine maven Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley).\nSaunders, who wrote and produced the series as well as starring in it, has promised a film version of Ab Fab for more than a decade.\nThe project is a collaboration between Fox Searchlight Pictures and BBC Films. The two studios confirmed filming would take place over the next seven weeks in the UK and France. The film is scheduled for release in 2016.\nAdvertisement According to sources, the first filming location is the French Riviera.\nThe film will also mark the return of the show's full ensemble, including Julia Sawalha as Edina's long-suffering daughter Saffron, Jane Horrocks as Edina's idiot savant assistant Bubble, and June Whitfield as Edina's mother.\nThough the two producing studios have not confirmed it, it's expected the film will also feature appearances by the show's much-loved minor characters, including magazine executive Magda (Kathy Burke), Patsy's colleagues Catriona (Helen Lederer) and Fleur (Harriet Thorpe) and Edina's former husband Marshall (Christopher Ryan) and his American wife, Bo (Mo Gaffney).\nAlmost all have returned through a succession of Ab Fab series and specials.\n\"I am thrilled and excited to finally start filming,\" Saunders said in a brief media statement issued jointly by Fox Searchlight Pictures and BBC Films.\n\"We are all taking our medication and hoping for the best.\"\nSaunders has written the script; the film will be directed by Mandie Fletcher, who has previously worked on the Absolutely Fabulous television series.\nFletcher's other credits include another Saunders' comedy, Jam and Jerusalem , which was produced between 2006 and 2009.\nSaunders is also an executive producer on the film, along with Jon Plowman, the iconic BBC comedy producer who first brought the series to the screen in the early 1990s, and Dawn French, who, with Saunders, wrote the French & Saunders sketch on which the series was based.\nAccording to Fox Searchlight Pictures and BBC Films, the film's plot will see Edina and Patsy swept up in a PR disaster and \"blamed for a major incident at an uber fashionable launch party.\"\nThe pair then become \"entangled in a media storm and are relentlessly pursued by the paparazzi\" and a forced to \"flee penniless to the glamorous playground of the super-rich, the French Riviera.\"\nOnce there, they \"hatch a plan to make their escape permanent and live the high life forever more.\"\nThough they have not yet confirmed any guest stars, Fox Searchlight Pictures and BBC Films said the film would feature \"a host of A-list stars from the acting, music and fashion worlds.\"\nBased on experience, that won't be a hollow promise.\nAbsolutely Fabulous has never had trouble pulling A-list guest stars, with actors Helena Bonham Carter and Minnie Driver, Spice girl Emma Bunton, supermodel Naomi Campbell, former models Britt Ekland, Anita Pallenberg and Twiggy, designers Terence Conran, Christian Lacroix, Stella McCartney and Zandra Rhodes and singers Marianne Faithfull, Elton John and Lulu among the TV show's long list of guest stars.\nThe original series aired between 1992 and 1995, lasting three seasons, and finished with a two-part finale titled 'The Last Shout'.\nIn 2001, Saunders produced a fourth series and in 2004, a fifth, as well as several specials. A 2004 special titled 'White Box' was the show's second intended series finale.\nIn 2012, however, timed to co-incide with the London Olympics, the BBC produced a sixth series, marking the show's 20th anniversary.\nThree episodes, including one set at the London Olympics, were produced by London-based Australian producer Justin Davies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:02:17.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
