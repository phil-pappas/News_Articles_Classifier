She will join the man who discovered and nurtured her, YTT host Johnny Young, in the Australian Recording Industry Association's hall of fame at the 2015 ARIA Awards.\nFive years ago, it was Arena who inducted Young – \"one of my favourite people\" - citing him as a personal and professional influence on her life in an emotion-laden speech. \"How do you thank someone who's taken you from crayons to perfume?\" she said then.\nAdvertisement Now, with a career that includes six ARIA Awards – four of them, including female artist of the year, in 1995, with her hit Chains – a Brit Award for best international newcomer and being named best French female artist in her then home of France in 2006, Arena will join names such as John Farnham, Cold Chisel, Slim Dusty and Dame Joan Sutherland in the hall of fame.\n\"What a thrill to receive this recognition for what has been an incredible journey so far,\" Arena said in a statement. \"I look forward to sharing this milestone with my peers along with the Australian public.\"\nThat award will sit alongside her Ordre National du Merite, in the category of chevalier, or knight, received from former French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009 for her contribution to the arts in France. It's an award which has only been presented to three Australians, the other two being a former governor and a former chief of the Australian navy.\nArena, who is 47, is still recording and performing and will release a new album, Eleven , on October 30. The ARIA Awards will be held in Sydney on November 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:20:00.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
