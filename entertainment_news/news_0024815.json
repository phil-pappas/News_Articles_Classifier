Wine Festival \nOn the north-eastern edge of Melbourne, where the suburbs give way to bush and mudbrick houses line the ridges, a maze of winding roads leads to old gold mining villages. The rocky ground and thin topsoil around St Andrews is perfect for growing low-yielding grape vines producing full-flavoured fruit. This small district, officially part of the Yarra Valley Wine Region, boasts more than a dozen small wineries, some open to the public by appointment. Next weekend sees 13 of them throwing open their doors or teaming up with local businesses, even the CFA, to show off their wines. Nillumbik Estate (open weekends and public holidays) is firing up the pizza oven and hosting musicians Louie & The Pride and Ben Smith. \nOpen Cellars is on next weekend, Oct 17-18, from 11am-5pm. A touring map can be downloaded at opencellars.com.au  \nPanton Hills Estate. Photo: RIchard Cornish \n2. Winery \nAdvertisement When the sun sets over Panton Hill the hand-hewn sandstone blocks of Teunis and Dorothy Kwak's winery light up in a glorious golden glow. The Tuscan-style winery was built in stages from 1973 using window frames and lintels from a historic city building. It includes floors lined with Welsh slate. This is a beautiful setting to try the estate chardonnay, cabernet franc (or the more unusual fortified chardonnay liqueur) and order a pizza to eat at the heavy wooden table. \nPanton Hill Winery, Sat-Sun and public holidays 11am-5pm, 145 Manuka Rd, Panton Hill. 9719 7342, pantonhillwinery.com.au  \nRob Hayley and his cast glass ammonite.

St Andrews Market \nFor more than 40 years this weekly gathering has been a cultural nexus where those who tuned in and dropped out rub shoulders with farmers, cooks and makers. About 100 stallholders set up by a tree-lined gully. Buskers play under shady gums and visitors munch on vegetarian tucker. This is the place to get hand-knitted toys, sourdough bread, dreadlock accessories, scented soap, unicorn high heel shoes, ceramics, home-grown apples and other expressions of imaginative human endeavour. A shuttle bus picks up from Hurstbridge station, meeting every morning train from 9.35am. Tradition has it that, after the market, visitors have lunch at the historic St Andrews pub, a diamond in the rough, popular with alternative lifestylers and motorbike enthusiasts.\nFor details visit standrewsmarket.com.au \nCemetery in the bush, Queenstown.

Smiths Gully Walking Track  \nThis short walking track starts opposite the St Andrews village hall and meanders through the bush before emerging about 1.5 kilometres away at the Queenstown Cemetery at the Smiths Gully goldfields. Look out for terrestrial orchids, flowering shrubs such as eremophila, mating echidnas, cuckoo-shrikes, treehoppers, pardalotes​ and emerging reptiles. \nDownload a walking trail map and guide from ntatourism.com \nSteak and mushroom pie from the Queenstown store.

Artist Rob Hayley works in stained glass using arcane techniques that haven't changed since the Middle Ages but he has also mastered modern techniques to make brightly coloured slumped and moulded glass sculptures. He draws inspiration from the bush and the night sky. His studio is open as he works (9 Dodd St, St Andrews, 0419 576 113), but some artists open only on special open studio weekends. The next is November 21-22, when 50 artists will open their studios to the public. Find out more at artistsopenstudios.com.au \n6. Bush Tucker Walk  \nWatsons Creek meanders through a eucalypt forest where ribbon weed floats on clear water, wallabies graze and eastern rosellas flit through the trees. A bush path takes hikers to a coranderrk​ (native mint bush), a tree with aromatic leaves and hard stems used by the Wurundjeri people to start fires. Interpretive signs show that the plant can be fashioned into spears that are accurate over 40 paces and how bracken roots can be roasted over coals. This beautiful short walk is a wonderful way to get close to the bush and learn about the culture of the local Wurundjeri.\nGawa Wurundjeri Aboriginal Resource Trail, Eltham-Yarra Glen Rd, Watsons Creek, Melways Ref 272 D5 \nNext Week: Meeniyan \n@Foodcornish \n6reasons@richardcornish.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:07:39.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
