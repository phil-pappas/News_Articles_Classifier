But that, after all, was the point of the show in the beginning: to challenge conventional public opinion on war, race, drugs, sexuality, religion and patriotism. \nThe story, by James Rado and Gerome Ragni, centers on a tribe of rebellious hippies dedicated to peace, love, freedom and happiness in a world torn by war, bigotry, conformity, political hypocrisy and environmental degradation. \nOf course, as young people, they’re also consumed by thoughts of their romantic entanglements even as they’re burning their draft cards and bras. \n“Hair” can be a chaotic enterprise but its experimental, unbridled style is part of its appeal. Like its free-spirited characters, “Hair” balks at the traditional rules. \nDirector Maegan McNerney Azar brings an admirable degree of clarity to the proceedings while eliciting broad, uninhibited and joyous performances from her actors, whose enthusiasm can’t be contained within the bounds of the stage. They frolic in the aisles, frequently interacting with the audience and coaxing a few patrons onto stage. \nDance plays a big part in the show as well. The swaying, hyper-kinetic choreography, by Azar and Madeline Jazz Harvey, is terrific. \nThe show really shines when the entire ensemble gets into the act, as in “Aquarius,” “Ain’t Got No Grass,” “Hair” and “Hare Krishna.” \nNow, for those aforementioned quibbles: A few solos on opening night sounded as if they could have benefited from some more rehearsal time. In addition, from where I sat, it seemed to me that the band occasionally drowned out the singers. This is a loud, rockin’ show — as it should be — but the vocals should always rise above the musical accompaniment. Diction was inconsistent — sometimes crisp, sometimes muddy. \nPerhaps the most dated part of “Hair” is the long-winded hallucinatory section in Act 2. Azar, to her credit, brings a creative momentum to this surreal riff on the Vietnam War. \nSalvo Donzella is appropriately assertive, even manic, as the grandstanding Berger. \nPatrick Fretwell is sympathetic as the ambivalent Claude, leading some of the show’s most stirring songs of affirmation (“I Got Life”) and helplessness (“Where Do I Go”). \nCourtney Dorn, as the earnest protester Sheila, brings a vibrant voice to songs such as “I Believe in Love” and “Good Morning, Starshine.” \nKenzie Wynne is endearing as the flibbertigibbet Crissy, sweetly singing “Frank Mills.” \nCarolyn Carrier-McClimon leads the excellent six-member band. \nMargaret Rose Caterisano is responsible for the colorful hippie costume design. \nThis zesty production of “Hair” continues through Oct. 25.
