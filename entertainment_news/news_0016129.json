The Moon is in Scorpio. Aries (March 21-April 19) \nThis is an excellent day (definitely better than most days) to wrap up loose details regarding inheritances, shared property, insurance disputes, taxes and debt. You can do this for your job and also for anything that is health-related or even related to a pet. Taurus (April 20-May 20) \nDiscussions with others, especially female friends or partners, will be quite productive today. You might have revolutionary ideas about how to deal with children, plan a vacation or work with sports, the arts, the entertainment world and the hospitality industry. Gemini (May 21-June 20) \nThis is a positive day at work for you. Whatever tasks that you set for yourself today will flow quite smoothly because unexpected support from others, as well as a chance to put a new spin on things, will help you achieve what you want to do. Good day to explore real-estate opportunities. Cancer (June 21-July 22) \nThis is a lovely, playful, creative day! A partner or a powerful individual that you encounter, especially in the general public, might help you. Explore creative opportunities in writing or doing anything with your hands. Plan a vacation. Enjoy fun times with children. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) \nThis is an excellent day for family discussions. Likewise, it’s a great day to work at home or get your home better organized. Interactions with female relatives will be positive. Whatever you do might somehow bring wealth to your home or boost your earnings. Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) \nYour communication skills are hot today! For starters, you’re in a positive frame of mind and eager to talk to others. In addition to this, you might see an entirely, fresh new approach to something. Naturally, others will think you’re a genius (instead of a clever, analytical Virgo). Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \nThis is an excellent day for business and finance and all financial dealings. You feel sympathetic to someone at work. However, behind-the-scenes deals and activities are what will really bless you today. You’re in a strong position of power now. Use it. Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \nToday the Moon is in your sign dancing beautifully with all the other planets. This means you feel confident, but probably emotional about something. Actually, this is a good day to ask the universe for a favor; you just might get a yes answer. Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \nYou will be successful in working alone or behind the scenes today because unseen forces will come to your aid. A family member, in particular, will be sympathetic to your needs. Whatever you do will also help promote your good name among your peers. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \nThis is a good day to schmooze with others. In particular, a conversation with a female acquaintance or friend could be significant for you. Travel plans or something to do with higher education, the law and medicine will likely take place. Stay on it. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) \nPeople notice you today. They might even be talking about you for some reason. Along with this, personal details about your private life will be under discussion. Be aware of this in case you want to hide something or steer things in a different direction. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) \nThis is a great day to get outta Dodge. Shake up your routine so that you can do something different. If you can travel to escape somewhere nice, do it. If not, do something different in your daily routine. Go someplace you’ve never been before. Be a tourist in your own town. If Your Birthday Is Today \nSinger-songwriter Natalie Maines (1974) shares your birthday today. You look at everything carefully and make sure of every possibility before you make a decision. You are not rash. People like you. This is the year you have been waiting for. It’s a time of expansion and great activity. Take advantage of opportunities. A major change might take place, perhaps as significant as what occurred around 2006. It’s time to try your wings!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:01:40.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
