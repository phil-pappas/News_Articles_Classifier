The performance will be held at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 17, in Leach Theatre of Castleman Hall, 10th and Main streets in Rolla.

Founded in 2003, “Classic Albums Live” is a concert series based in Toronto, Ontario, in which musicians play complete classic rock albums. The group is known for the dedication it has to faithfully recreating the sound of the original album. “Classic Albums Live” has performed Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run” and the Rolling Stones’“Sticky Fingers” as well as a 13-hour concert in which they performed the entire 213-song Beatles song catalog. “This is a great opportunity for the Rolla community to experience one of the greatest albums of all time,” said Roy Jacobs, a marketing representative for Leach Theatre. “‘Classic Albums Live’ will re-create the album to convey its original brilliance.” Tickets are $35 for adults and $25 for youth age 18 and younger.
