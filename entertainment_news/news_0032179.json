Photo / iStock Wellington's reputation has blown its way across the globe, with UK media organisation The Guardian confirming claims our capital is the world's windiest city. Another contender for the moniker was Chicago, although some suggest the Illinois entrant's nickname originated from political 'hot air' rather than its meteorological history. The Guardian focused on the iconic 'Solace in the Wind' statue on Wellington's waterfront. England-born local sculptor Max Patte said he often found inspiration in the gusty conditions, even if at times he found the weather \"exhausting\". \"You know you're home when there's a southerly blowing,\" Patte said. The Guardian said \"judging which is the world's windiest city is tricky, as no global database for cities exists and measurement techniques are not standardised\".Th findings were based mainly on reputation. Most Wellingtonians learn to embrace the wind, treating it as one of the quirks of the cultural and creative capital, but for outsiders the gusty statistics speak volumes. \"The North Island's strongest recorded gust of 154mph (248km/h) was measured on Hawkins Hill in 1962, just a few kilometres from the city centre,\" The Guardian said. As any good Wellingtonian should, acting mayor Justin Lester was able to breeze through the various benefits the city receives due to its unique weather offerings, saying \"sailors, windsurfers and kite-surfers come from afar to ride the vortex\". and \"air pollution is non-existent as any fumes are whipped away and wind power is harnessed for electricity\".
