Recorded at studios across States, including a stop-off at Sun in Memphis with a celeb rhythm section of Patricks Carney and Keeler on drums and Mark Ronson on bass, its variety is part of its strength, even if the sub-Aerosmith pop-metal of that track, Last Damn Night, is chiefly notable for the Stairway to Heaven gag King sneaks in to the lyrics.\nShare article Her sassy words, very much in the Amy Winehouse \"I told you I was trouble\" vein, are one of the sets main strengths, from opener Where the Devil Don't Go taking a step beyond the bluesman's pact at the crossroads, to the fickle ladette anthem, Ex's and Oh's, and hymn to hedonistic indulgence, Under The Influence, that follow. When things take a country turn, as they inevitably do, King strums the banjo, with Make You Smile remarkably sweet and tender by way of contrast.\nKeith Bruce", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-14T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:44:26.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
