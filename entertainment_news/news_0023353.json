By Indo-Asian News Service on October 19, 2015 at 1:53 AM Comments \nLondon, Oct 19 : Former One Direction member Zayn Malik has reportedly told his ex-fiancee Perrie Edwards he still loves her. Malik is said to have used a text message to open his heart to his ex-fiancee, reports mirror.co.uk. He ended their four-year relationship earlier this year with a single message out of the blue, despite having planned a wedding with the Little Mix star. \nHe has since been seen out with a string of girls, something which a source close to Edwards says is “killing her”. And friends of Edwards are said to fear that she will take him back. The source said: “Zayn has started messaging Perrie again saying he misses and still loves her. ”Although Perrie is trying to be strong and move on, it’s obvious to everyone around her she’s still in love with Zayn.
