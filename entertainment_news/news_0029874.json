The driver's name is being withheld pending notification of his family.\nThe accident occurred in front of 381 E. U.S. 6 when the driver of the pickup, a maroon 1998 Ford F150, went left of center into the path of a semitrailer that was traveling westbound, Sgt. Jamie Erow, public information officer for the sheriff's department, said.\nThe driver of the truck, John Jerdon, 59, of Walkerton, complained of pain to his back and neck and was transported to Porter Regional Hospital. He was not issued any citations.\nToxicology reports are pending for both drivers.\nThe county's crash reconstruction team was called to assist at the scene, as were the Liberty Township Fire Department, Porter EMS, the Indiana Department of Transportation, Porter County Hazmat and Joe's Towing.\nEarly Saturday morning, Juan Luis Lamar III, 19, of Hobart, died in a single-car accident on U.S. 6 in the Jackson Farms area of Jackson Township. The accident occurred at 12:38 a.m.\nErow said witnesses saw Lamar's car, a silver 2001 Jeep, going eastbound on U.S. 6 leave the roadway to the south, travel over a gravel access road, go back up an embankment, and go airborne across U.S. 6, landing deep in a wooded area on the north side of the road.\nAgencies assisting with the crash were the Liberty Township, Westville and Washington Township fire departments, and Porter EMS.\nPolice do not yet know if alcohol or drugs were a contributing factor in that accident.\nAmy Lavalley is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Post-Tribune Traffic Accidents", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625430e/turbine/ct-ptb-porter-fatal-crashes-st-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:37:39.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
