(PRWEB) October 22, 2015\nAuthor Gary Steven Schultz , in his debut novel, “ Kingdoms of the Heart ” (published by Archway Publishing), explores the timeless theme of forbidden love and how it affects the people involved.\nIn this story, set in the Early Modern Period in Europe, Prince Alexander reluctantly agrees to treat Princess Arayna as his diplomatic guest for an extended period of time, only to find that they have irresistible chemistry. He then risks everything to follow his heart in the matter.\nSchultz shares that people will be able to relate to the story because readers will be able to step into the struggles of the characters who are in the “right relationship, but are convinced that it is wrong by people around them.”\nSchultz explains that humans are fragile and tend to cave to societal pressure instead of following their dreams, and that this novel highlights that aspect of humanity. “Live life,” advises Schultz, “instead of allowing life to live you.”\n“Kingdoms of the Heart”\nBy Gary Steven Schultz\nHardcover | 6 x 9in | 268 pages | ISBN 9781480821842\nSoftcover | 6 x 9in | 268 pages | ISBN 9781480821866\nE-Book | 268 pages | ISBN 9781480821859\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nGary Steven Schultz earned a doctorate in psychiatric nursing from Boston College as well as having earned degrees in philosophy and theology.
