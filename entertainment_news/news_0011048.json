Picture: Instagram Raised by Cruise and his staff of Scientologists, Isabella, 22, a hair and make-up artist at Vidal Sassoon in London, is still a member of the controversial flock.\nHer new husband, who she has dated for under a year, British IT consultant Max Parker, reportedly is not, although he counts Scientologists among his closest friends.\nKidman has always maintained she will be there for her two adult children when they choose to return to her. If Parker is indeed unaffiliated with the organisation, he may prove Kidman’s best hope yet of bringing her daughter back to her.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8d19a9f1a8efbed85251c8dbf9f8dce1?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:13:02.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
