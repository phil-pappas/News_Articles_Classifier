By NATHAN DEEN MONROE, La. — The numbers take you by surprise when you look at the final stat sheet.\nDid Georgia Southern really rush for 455 yards in a game in which the Eagles seemed to coast to a 51-31 win over Louisiana Monroe?\nI didn’t even notice.\nHere’s what I did notice: They committed 12 penalties for 109 yards, the passing offense struggled again, and a 31-3 lead gradually became 31-24 by the fourth quarter.\nThe Eagles have scored 95 points in their first two conference games and racked up 1,076 yards of offense. Yet against Idaho and ULM, there have been phases when this team falls asleep at the wheel, and they wake up only when opponents start knocking on the door — whether throwing a pick six or allowing a deep touchdown pass.\nGeorgia Southern’s LA Ramsby ran untouched for a 40-yard touchdown in response to the Warhawks on Saturday, and Kevin Ellison ran for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to finally put the host Vandals away on Sept. 26.\nThat’s what I like to call tortoise-and-hare football, and right now the Eagles are playing the part of the hare. We all know what happens to him.\nAnd just like the tortoise, the Vandals and Warhawks had no business even sniffing the lead.\nThe outcomes of the Eagles’ first two conference games were a combination of letting their opponents hang around and their opponents declining that invitation, turning around to shoot themselves in the foot instead.\nNo one was sure what kind of ULM team would take the field in Saturday’s game after the Warhawks received the tragic news that injured backup quarterback Daniel Fitzwater had died just hours before kickoff. Would they come out fired up and take it to GSU early?\nThat wasn’t the case, though emotions were running high all game. ULM committed several costly penalties early and had its opening punt blocked by the Eagles for a touchdown.\nEverything that could go wrong did, and in the blink of an eye, GSU was up 31-3 almost without even trying.\nThe rout was on until the Eagles let off the gas and offered a glimmer of hope when they tried an onside kick just before halftime. ULM recovered and made GSU pay with a quick touchdown drive.\nNo big deal. Still a 21-point lead, right? The Eagles got the ball to start the second half and they could score again to erase any doubts.\nThey started to do just that but were forced to a fourth down at the ULM 13-yard line. No problem. Settle for the 30-yard field goal. Alex Hanks hadn’t missed all season.\nThe kick went wide right — a 7-minute, 9-second drive came up empty. Four plays later, the Warhawks were in the end zone on a drive keyed by a 69-yard pass from Garrett Smith to Ajalen Holley.\nTime to get serious. Ellison started the next GSU drive with a 21-yard run, and the Eagles were quickly in Warhawk territory. The offense stalled out again at the 37-yard line, and the Eagles punted. ULM was going to have a chance to make it a one-score game.\nSmith’s first throw was intercepted by Darius Jones at the 36. That sealed it. No way ULM could overcome that many mistakes.\nThe Eagles gained three yards and failed to convert on fourth down, practically giving the Warhawks 23 yards of field position.\nSmith was intercepted again, this time by Matt Dobson. Southern fans could rest easy as the game headed into the fourth quarter.\nLess than a minute into the fourth, however, Junior Williams jumped on Ellison’s throw to the corner and took it 56 yards the other way for a ULM touchdown.\nJust leave it to the ULM defense to collapse on the next drive after getting so close.\nBig test coming\nThe question is, what’s going to happen when the Eagles play a team that doesn’t make these kinds of mistakes? They could find out Oct. 22 when they travel to rival Appalachian State, a game that could very well decide who wins the Sun Belt this season. It could be a reality check.\nWith a well-timed bye week and then an Oct. 17 home game against New Mexico State, it’s best to have that reality check now.\nOtherwise, they could wake up and realize they’re out of the race.\nNathan Deen covers Georgia Southern athletics for the Savannah Morning News.
