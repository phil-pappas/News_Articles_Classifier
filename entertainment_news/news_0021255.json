I'm honestly just looking for an explanation for what I saw.\" \nBeing a paranormal investigator, I'm very skeptical and need proof before I believe in anything that could be considered paranormal. \nThe photo, if it truly has not been messed with or wasn't set up, is pretty intriguing. \nYou can clearly see wings on the creatures back and horns on its head. Its feet are cloven and the fur is dark brown. \nAnd it's obviously off the ground. \nI don't see any wires or string holding it up like a piñata. \nWhat is it? \n\"The mind plays tricks on you,\" Black admitted. \"A friend suggested that maybe it was an animal running and an owl grabbed it, the photo being a combination of them. That's still not my first instinct, but I don't know how to explain it otherwise.\" \nHis final statement on the incident was simply, \"I think I saw a large, flying mammal about the size of a deer.\" \nHave you ever seen the Jersey Devil? \nDo you believe in the legend? \nWhat do you think of the photo captured by Black in Galloway Township? \nEmail me at kroncace@njadvancemedia.com or comment below with your thoughts.
