The icing to the cake was that in last season's finale, Panjabi's last episode for the series, the two characters had a reunion -- via split-screen.\nView Gallery\nMargulies tried to extinguish the fire during an appearance at the New Yorker Festival on Sunday; she denied that there was any bad blood between herself and her co-star.\n\"Right, I've heard about [the feud]. Who says that? It's totally gossip,\" Margulies said. \"I heard that question had been asked to Robert King. There's no story there, sorry ... I actually had heard [that rumor] and I feel that it has been talked about and answered. I feel people just like to have gossip or make something into something that isn't there. There's no animosity on my part. It's a shame, because I wonder if it was two men, when one finds out that he f***ed his best friend's wife, if it would get that same attention, you know what I mean?\"\nView Gallery\nArchie Panjabi as Kalinda Sharma on CBS' \"The Good Wife.\"\nDavid Giesbrecht/CBS As for why the show used a split-screen?\n\"It was shot the way Robert wanted to shoot it, and the story line, too,\" she said. \"You also have to remember, there's difficulty ... [Panjabi] was also doing another show, called 'The Fall.' I went along with whatever Robert asked me to do and I did it happily.\"\nSounds good to us -- but not to Panjabi.\nThe actress, now unfettered from her \"Good Wife\" duties, hit back: \" @TheFallTV was not even in production at that time and I was in New York ready to film the scene!\"\nBut is it a feud if both parties can't agree? What do you think?\nhttp://t.co/7Ci8jY9lSf . @TheFallTV was not even in production at that time and I was in New York ready to film the scene!\nâ€” Archie Panjabi (@PanjabiArchie) October 5, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_good_wife/", "https://twitter.com/PanjabiArchie/status/651035191985631233", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/26/0d73ce78-1f82-454a-92bd-f595e304eeb6/thumbnail/620x350/00b2cf9594f0b667820fba8313369f49/julianna-margulies-the-good-wife-courtroom-promo.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/15/f162e7a9-8b9f-4f70-b847-2117cb98f7de/thumbnail/620x350/114bd8371b9e240bf9f645a2b159818d/101415d0319b.jpg", "http://t.co/7Ci8jY9lSf", "https://twitter.com/TheFallTV"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:15:17.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
