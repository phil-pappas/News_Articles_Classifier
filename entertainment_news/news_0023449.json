Ann Loveless and husband, Steven Loveless, garnered the most votes for their \"Northwood Awakening,\" a huge quilt and photographic print hybrid that depicts a woodland panorama. The work is on display at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum.\nAnn Loveless also won the 2013 public vote grand prize for a large quilt picturing a serene Lake Michigan shoreline.\nArtPrize officials awarded $500,000 in prize money tonight in categories decided by popular vote and juries of experts. The grand prize jury award went to New Yorker Kate Gilmore's \"Higher Ground,\" a site-specific, conceptual work part of SiTE:LAB's Rumsey Street Project, a group of abandoned neighborhood buildings given over to artists. Gilmore's work is a house painted pink, with swings mounted inside that allow a gaggle of women to simultaneously sway in and out of the windows in a choreographed commentary on gender roles and domesticity.\n\"Higher Ground\" by New York artist Kate Gilmore won the $200,000 Juried Grand Prize at the seventh edition of ArtPrize in Grand Rapids.
