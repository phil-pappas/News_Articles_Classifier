Through the song we try to tell people the importance of a girl child and the place she holds in her father's life,\" Supriyo told PTI.\nThe track that celebrates daughterhood airs Sunday on a special episode of MTV Coke Studio Season four.\n\"The entire credit for the song goes to my dear friend Debabrata Mukherjee, VP Coca Cola. We were watching a Tennis match together and during that time we got the idea about this song. My daughter is inclined to western contemporary music and that's why the song is an amalgamation of Hindi and English lyrics,\" Supriyo said.\nThe song has been composed by Piku music director Anupam Roy.\n\"He (Anupam) knows good music. He has been composing music for Bengali film industry from last five years. He recently composed the music for 'Piku' and people appreciated his work. He has a western contemporary feel to his music and that's why he was the first choice for the song,\" said the Sochta Hun Uska Dil singer.\nThe teasers of the song are already getting rave reviews from the industry big shots including Amitabh Bachchan.\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Babul Supriyo - Sochta Hun Uska Dil\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/YN0vDctyAcM", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://gaana.com/artist/babul-supriyo", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T10:21:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
