The Ashby resident and IRNE Award-winning actor is relishing the opportunity to play the plum role of linguist-educator Henry Higgins in the Lyric Stage Company of Boston revival, which runs through October 11. The latest Hub edition also features Shrewsbury native Jared Troilo as Lord Freddy Eynsford-Hill, Higgins’ rival for flower-girl-turned-lady Eliza Doolittle. For Chew — who has played Bob Crachit in “A Christmas Carol” at the Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts and performed in “Man of La Mancha” at Worcester Foothills — “My Fair Lady’s\" underlying themes could not be more apparent. \"The theme of education is so clear. It’s also about access. We understand the importance of how we educate people today. Even today we need to inspire people.” “One big thing,\" he added, \"is talking about communication. It’s the language barrier that keeps people from talking to each other.” Both actors praised director Scott Edmiston’s emphasis on the collaborative process. “He created an atmosphere that valued all our voices,” said Chew. Troilo, a Boston Conservatory graduate who performed in a Foothills staging of “The Mikado,” appreciated the fact that the Lyric Stage Company's edition gave considerable weight during the rehearsal process to the more ambiguous ending of the George Bernard Shaw play “Pygmalion” — the source of the famed Lerner and Loewe musical. “Until opening night,“ he said, “one way hurled more towards Freddy.” Echoing the dramatist’s reflections on the ending, he added, “Shaw felt she (Eliza) would have married Freddy.” In light of these observations, part of what makes this revival \"lovely\" (as Eliza would say) is how sympathetic Freddy becomes. \"In some ways Freddie is everything Henry isn’t. Freddy has the heart and Higgins the creativity,” Troilo said. At the same time, “They (Higgins and Eynsford-Hill) kind of both feel like they’re outsiders. In many ways they’re alike.” “He’s definitely one of the most sensitive people I’ve played in recent years,\" Troilo said. \"Freddy is someone who’s optimistic and a dreamer.” As a whole, “My Fair Lady” remains a brilliant blend of dreams and relationships — a combination that director Edmiston has realized as skillfully as Higgins transforms Eliza. Clearly this actors’ director has made this affecting staging highly personal with his own individual touches while retaining the show’s great intelligence and spirit. Songbird Jennifer Ellis captures both the heroine’s early outspoken frustration learning English phonetics — credit a handsome backdrop chart in Janie E. Howland’s imaginative sets — and her emerging elegance and sophistication as a stunning young woman — especially in Gail Astrid Buckley’s exquisite evening wear. Eliza’s blossoming proves most striking as she moves from being the source of Higgins’ and colleague Colonel Pickering’s wager to asserting her own needs and individual will in strong renditions of “Show Me” (to Freddy) and “Without You” (to Henry). Her rival suitors are played with equal heart by Chew and Troilo. Chew finds Higgins’ fleeting moments of vulnerability as well as his sometimes insufferable self-confidence. As an actor with a strong voice, he gives such lyrically rich numbers as “Why Can’t the English” and “I’m an Ordinary Man” uncommon resonance. At the same time, Troilo captures Freddy’s caring and inner artistry — whether immediately falling for Eliza or escorting her as she says goodbye to her native Lysson Grove section of London. His rendition of “On the Street Where You Live,” well-phrased and warmly delivered, provides a properly arresting first act curtain. Edmiston conveys the physical and emotional effect of Freddy’s long-term vigil waiting for Eliza by having him repeatedly writing to her and rubbing a sore foot — a sidewalk action that demonstrates the full impact of his attentiveness. Karen Perlow’s nuanced lighting reaches a high point when Eliza considers both Freddy and Henry in heightened photograph-like juxtaposition. Edmiston and company do such justice to both Shaw and Lerner and Loewe that audiences will wish they could stay all night at the Lyric Stage. Troilo will be continuing his love affair with musical theater in late November in Fiddlehead Theater Company’s revival of “The Little Mermaid” at Boston’s Strand Theatre. His multi-talented actress wife, Kira Cowan, will be choreographing the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:33:35.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
