There are many areas, perhaps even in your own area, where there is hardly such a supply shop from where you can hope to get arts and crafts items for the kids. Can you imagine the problems? Just imagine that it is the summer time and school is off. It is the time to engage the kids in some productive activity for developing their skills and creativity.
