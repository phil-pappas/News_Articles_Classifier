I'm the house's designated IT department, so I get an earful whenever there's no connectivity. Our Wi-Fi router's signal isn't able to cover the whole house, so for a few years now I've been using a Wi-Fi range extender.\nAn extender does exactly what you'd think, acting as a bridge so that wireless devices too far from the router can still access the internet. The model I tried worked well at first, but soon showed problems. It needed to be reset every day or so, and the signal wasn't that strong.\nI decided I needed a new and more capable range extender, so I've been testing the TrendNet AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender (trendnet.com; $87,99), which launched a month ago. A ferociously powerful tool, this model has a lot to like.\nThe AC1200 offers two types of Wi-Fi, AC and N. AC is much faster, able to handle 867Mbps, but its range isn't that great. N is slower, with a 300Mbps top speed, but its range is better. This extender offers both, and intelligently routes traffic on whichever network is the better choice at that moment.\nThe best way to test Wi-Fi is by streaming high-definition video, since that's likely the most demanding thing you'll want to do. When I'm on a phone or notebook connected to the AC1200 and I'm at the farthest point in my house from the router, video starts playing immediately and never buffers. That's all I could ask for.\nI had a little trouble with the initial setup, but TrendNet's support walked me through the issue. Once I reset the AC1200 and tried the setup a second time, all went well. You probably won't have an issue, but if you do just let them know.\nWi-Fi dead zones are a hassle and home IT pros know all about it. Get the TrendNet AC1200 and those dead zones might be a thing of the past.\nFollow TROY DREIER at http://twitter.com/TDreier or e-mail him at loggedon@mac.com.", "external_links":
