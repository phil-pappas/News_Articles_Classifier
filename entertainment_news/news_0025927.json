(Photo by Amy Sussman/Invision/AP)Invision Associated Press October 16, 2015 01:01 AM At 55, Mark Rylance is taking his most significant step into cinema, starring in not one but two films by Steven Spielberg: \"Bridge of Spies,\" in which he plays the Soviet spy Rudolph Abel, and next year's \"The BFG,\" in which he plays the titular giant. It's a fortuitous turn of events. Spielberg offered the then little-known Rylance a part in his 1987 World War II drama \"Empire of the Sun.\" Simultaneously, Rylance's friend Mike Alfreds was taking over the National Theatre and wanted him for the upcoming season. Torn between the options, Rylance left the decision up to fate. He rolled an I Ching divining dice, read its meaning and elected for the stage over Spielberg. His notoriety grew at the National, where he also met Claire van Kampen, whom he wed two years later. \"I met my wife by turning him down,\" says Rylance, smiling. \"Now it's come around full circle.\" Rylance, a two-time Tony winner (2007's \"Boeing-Boeing,\" 2011's \"Jerusalem\") is a chameleon, capable of a double bill of the grieving Olivia in \"Twelfth Night\" and the crookbacked king of \"Richard III.\" He's known for both his profound stillness and his soulful spontaneity. Al Pacino has said he \"speaks Shakespeare as if it was written for him the night before.\" Those qualities are on full display in \"Bridge of Spies,\" a Cold War thriller in which Rylance plays opposite Tom Hanks, an actor as at home on camera as Rylance is on the stage. Hanks stars as James Donovan, an insurance attorney enlisted to give the accused spy a legal defense. Rylance's quiet, wry Abel gives the film its glow. Spielberg calls Rylance \"a shape-shifter, a man of a thousand faces and voices who can play any part.\" \"Seldom has an actor been around for so many distinguished years on the stage and yet had not been fully discovered for the screen,\" Spielberg said. \"Mark understands that the camera records stillness better than in any other media. His transition from the stage to 'Bridge of Spies' was graceful and invisible.\" For Rylance, embracing movie acting has been a circuitous journey. As a young actor, he watched as his theater contemporaries -- Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh -- became famous on the big screen. Agents urged Rylance into TV and film so that he would be \"a complete actor.\" \"I just, time and again, was attracted by the theater where I was offered better opportunities,\" Rylance said. \"I auditioned for films and didn't get them. I think I had some stuff to learn about film acting. I don't think I was personally really ready for it. But I did come to resent it. I did eventually think: Why, why? You wouldn't tell the great Tamasaburo or Ganjiro-san it's not enough to be a Kabuki actor, you need to be a film actor.\" He rattles off some film experiences he's enjoyed: the Quay brothers' \"Institute Benjamenta,\" the 1995 A.S. Byatt adaptation \"Angels and Insects\" and a handful of British TV films, such as \"The Government Inspector.\" \"But I've made some bad films, too, that have not been enjoyable,\" Rylance said. \"At a certain point after one of them I did a few years back, I said, 'That's it. I'm not interested in this anymore.' \"I thought: I need to be happy with who I am, where I am. That can be the kind of miners' dust of being an actor,\" he said. \"Being dissatisfied with who you are can be the reason for becoming an actor, and it can become an illness.\" What do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:06:43.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
