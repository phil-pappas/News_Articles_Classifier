AP PHOTOS: Promoting James Bond from 'Dr. No' to 'Spectre' File - In this 1963 file photo, Scottish actor Sean Connery, left, actress Phyllis Newman and conductor Leonard Bernstein are shown at the US premiere of the James Bond movie \"Dr. No\" in New York. \"Dr. No\" was the first official Bond film adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel. The movie didn't have anything like the budget of future Bond films, including the upcoming \"Spectre\" which has its World Premiere on Monday Oct. 26, 2015, in London. Connery would play Bond in five further authorized films, before returning from a 12-year hiatus to star in the unofficial \"Never Say Never Again\" in 1983.
