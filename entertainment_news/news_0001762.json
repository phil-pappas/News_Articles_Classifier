It was weird, but became regular feature in every country that India toured. Let alone in India, it was unlikely to witness an entire stadium cheer for an opposition player. (Also Read – India lose 5th ODI by 214 runs; South Africa win Paytm Freedom series 3-2 in Mumbai ) 10 years back when South Africa toured India, the crowd was cheering for the visiting side in Kolkata. There was a reason. Sourav Ganguly ’s axing and the then Indian coach Greg Chappell’s middle-finger show had irked the crowd at Eden Gardens. This time, however, in all the celebration of South African landmarks, the crowd had their unflinching support towards the Indians. They celebrated AB Villiers’ sixes and centuries with as much joy as they celebrated the fall of his wicket. In fact, every time he walked out to bat, cheers of ‘AB! AB!’ engulfed the stadium. Like Harsha Bhogale mentioned, Brian Lara and Shane Warne too got warm reception when they toured India, but nothing like what was on display for AB. Maybe this was an after-reaction following the brickbats that the Cuttack crowd received on social media. Maybe it was a mob culture that followed witnessing how the Green Park crowd danced and cheered watching AB de Villiers ’ knock. Maybe Indian Premier League (IPL) created a new fan base for players from other countries. Whatever the reason be, they not only put up an excellent advertisement for cricket, but also lessened the damage done by the crowd at Barabati Stadium. By the time the caravan had moved to Mumbai, every single landmark – be it by Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis or AB de Villiers – got a standing ovation. The crowd even cheered Kagiso Rabada when he bowled a bouncer at close to 150 kmph. The ground that for decades heard just one chant ‘Sachin! Sachin!’ celebrated new heroes and modern masters. Victory and defeat served as a mere parcel to a much bigger cause. Even in India’s defeat, South Africans got a warm reception. Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi would’ve been proud. \nModified Date: October 26, 2015 4:45 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:21:09.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
