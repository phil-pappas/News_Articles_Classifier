Jay Leno was telling jokes. \nHost Jimmy Fallon pretended to pull a hamstring during his monologue, calling for an emergency replacement — his predecessor. Leno, who left the show last year after two decades in charge, is busy promoting a new car-focused show for CNBC. \nLeno got rolling right away with political one-liners. \nHe noted that presidential candidate Marco Rubio is being called the best communicator in the Republican Party, \"which is kind of like being the smartest Kardashian.\" \nIf Democrat Bernie Sanders wins, Leno said, \"he'll be the first socialist elected president since 2008.\" \nAnd if the Republican race comes down to Jeb Bush against Donald Trump, it will be like \"the tortoise and the bad hair.\" \nLeno, looking slightly paunchier than when regular monologues kept him in fighting shape, even poked fun at neighbors of the former California-based \"Tonight\" show. Fallon moved the show to New York when he took over. \n\"The economy is so bad that parents in Beverly Hills are being forced to raise their own children,\" Leno said. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:32:26.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
