Both Miller and Price are survivors and still work as stylists at the salon.\nLast year, though, at only age 36, Jones lost her battle with cancer, Grosse said.\nGrosse added that they've not only seen stylists at the salon devastated by a cancer diagnosis, but also so many of their customers.\nSo six years ago they decided to do things a little differently each October. They decided that the salon would give all of the money raised through the pink hair extensions to a local family who needs it to help pay for out of pocket expenses that result from a cancer diagnosis.\n\"As we have fought through cancer with these girls and several clients of our salon, we have changed up how we donate,\" Grosse said.\nLast year, they donated the proceeds to the Jones family.\nThis year, they chose the family of Monica Grund of Lake in the Hills, a client of the salon and Grosse's neighbor.\nThey've also added purple and green extensions as a choice this year, as Monica is in her second battle with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She has gone through chemo, radiation and is currently going through a stem cell transplant at Loyola, Grosse said.\nThe funds raised will go to help pay expenses for Monica, her husband, Mike, and their three children, Kyle, Katelyn and Konner.\nThe extensions are $12 a strand and 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the family.\n\"Unfortunately, there are so many people we know that are struggling with the illness that can use the financial help,\" Grosse said.\nHearing about the cause, the girls on the Heat United U13 soccer team based in Huntley joined together this month to get their pink hair extensions and show support.\nTwelve-year-old Heat United team member Olivia Breunig of Algonquin, who goes to stylist Kristin Miller, wanted to do something to help. So she and her mom Mary organized the team outing to Salon 37.\n\"Each October, we find a way to wear pink within our soccer uniforms to recognize cancer,\" Breunig said. \"This year I thought it would be great for us to get pink hair extensions to show our support, not only for a special local family, but everyone out there who is affected by cancer.\n\"I hope that moms reading this article will take their daughters in to get pink hair extensions, too. I just love mine and everything that it stands for.\"\nIn all, 15 girls on the Heat United U13 team got the extensions. Their donations raised $180 for the Grund family, and they hope the strands are shining brightly on the field during each of their soccer games.\nWhen someone asks where the girls got the pink strands, they tell them about Salon 37 and what they do with the money, Breunig said.\nTo get your own pink, purple or green extension this month, visit Salon 37 at 1415 Commerce Drive in Algonquin, on the east side of Randall Road.\nFor information, call Salon 37 at (847) 658-3737.\nâ€¢ Amy Williams' column covers all the news of business along the Randall Road corridor from Batavia to Crystal Lake.
