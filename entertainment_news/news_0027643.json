But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring \"the Martian\" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.\nBased on a best-selling novel, and helmed by master director Ridley Scott , The Martian features a star studded cast that includes Jessica Chastain , Kristen Wiig , Kate Mara , Michael Pena , Jeff Daniels , Chiwetel Ejiofor , and Donald Glover . www.themartianmovie.com\nAbout IMAX Corporation\nIMAX, an innovator in entertainment technology, combines proprietary software, architecture and equipment to create experiences that take you beyond the edge of your seat to a world you've never imagined.
