But her just-released album, “The Dash Between the Dates” (eOne Music) may be her most accomplished set of work yet – the full package of melodies, lyrics and earthy soul that brought her to the attention of world-renowned fellow musicians in the first place. “I think what’s different now is that I’m writing with wider-angle lens – a wider perspective,” Sharp said. “My writing in the past has been more about ‘you and me’ and very personal stories, but these songs are coming more from a learned, ‘life can feel like this’ kind of place. It can be real challenge to write from that wider place – it’s important to me that these sound like they come from a universal perspective. I had to dig a little deeper.” Sharp is bringing “Dash Between the Dates” on the road for a tour that arrives at the Milton Art Center in Milton this Saturday. Joining Sharp will be album co-producer Linda Taylor, a multi-instrumentalist and Sharp’s longtime collaborator. Taylor is well-known to fans of TV’s “Whose Line Is It Anyway,” having been one of that improv show’s featured musicians. Alongside Sharp she’ll play both acoustic and electric guitars and help her co-conspirator keep things interesting. “She’s officially a badass,” Sharp said, laughing. If Sharp’s songs sound more lived in, that comes in part from experience, she acknowledges. Having her songs recorded by the likes of Raitt – who also guested on Sharp’s last album – is “so very validating,” she says, but it’s decades of working in the music business that sharpened her chops. “I’ve been doing this now for 20 years,” she said. “Not being 25 anymore and having seen a few things, lost family members and friends, you start to look at the world in a different way. The pitfall in writing these types of songs is that you want that universal perspective without telling someone how they’re supposed to feel. It’s a balance of keeping what you do humble, but informed.” Music previewMAIA SHARP7:30 p.m. Saturday, October 17. at Milton Art Center, 334 Edge Hill Road, Milton, Tickets $15.
