Harlequinn​. $29.99. \nPretty Baby , by Mary Kubica is a tightly constructed and suspenseful tale. Photo: Supplied \nRecently there has been a flood of marriage thrillers, or domestic noirs, which mirror Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl in asking 'how well do we really know those we love the most?'\nAdvertisement These thrillers play to our darkness fears and insecurities about trust, fidelity and how easily we can lose everything, including our families.\nNow the writing team behind the pseudonym of A J Rich have extended these fears to include the family pet. The Hand That Feeds You opens with Morgan, a 30-year-old graduate student studying victimology, returning home to her Brooklyn apartment to find that her fiance has been mauled to death by her dogs, including two strays she has recently taken in.\nThat, however, is only the start of Morgan's problems. When she recovers enough to try to contact her fiance's family in Quebec, she finds out that his parents do not seem to exist. It turns out the guy she met on the Internet might not have been who he said he was. More troubling, he seems to have had other fiances, some of whom have met violent deaths. As Morgan investigates, she begins to wonder who was more trustworthy, the killer dogs or the lying fiance.\nThis is an easy flowing and engaging tale that moves along at a good pace. The plotting and the characters are interesting and the authors fill the book with fascinating details and insightful anecdotes. In the end Morgan's assessment of her fiance boils down to the simple: \"He never liked dogs and dogs never liked him.\" What more do you need to know?\nMary Kubica's​ Pretty Baby also deals with the risks of taking in strays.\nHeidi Wood is a good person. She is an enthusiastic recycler, works for a charity and takes in stray cats. When she spots a teenage girl standing in the rain on a train platform clutching an infant, Heidi feels compels to help. Despite the objections of her family, Heidi invites the girl, Willow, and her young baby into her home. What starts as an act of kindness, however, quickly spirals into something much nastier as Willow's secrets, and those of Heidi's family, come to the surface.\nThis is a tightly constructed and suspenseful tale full of carefully crafted characters and complicated moral dilemmas. Alternating the telling between Heidi, Willow and Heidi's husband, Chris, Kubica​ twists and turns her story to a suitably dark conclusion. Although a little slow to start, the second half of the book will have you anxiously turning the pages to find out what happens next.\nJeff Popple is a Canberra reviewer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:20:36.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
