This is not all. Her song from Indru Netru Naalai, Kadhale Kadhale, has also been receiving a wide acclaim. Interestingly, both the songs have been composed by Hip Hop Tamizha. Padmalatha says, \"After rendering a song for Uttama Villain, I got some interesting offers. I recorded a song for Indru Netru Naalai first with Aadhi. He's an extremely nice person to work with. Working with Aadhi is similar to working with an independent musician. You can never say that this song falls under one particular genre as he mixes several genres in one song. When I recorded for Kannala... we recorded in different styles. Later, he patched the song from different styles that I had recorded. This happened with Kadhale, too. In fact, my co-singer Shankar Mahadevan had even inquired from Aadhi if I recorded the song at one go like this. He patches them so seamlessly that the outcome is great to hear.\"\nPadmalatha has also recorded a song for Attakathi Dinesh's Oru Naal Koothu. \"I have sung two songs for the album. One is a melody with Sean Roldan and another is a folk number with Karthik. It is heartening for me to sing in different genres. I also have a couple of more songs in the pipeline, but waiting for the official announcement,\" she signs off.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:19:17.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
