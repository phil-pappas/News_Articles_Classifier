PUBLISHED: 18:55, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:20, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 ROCKSTAR GTA 5's Lowrider update is skipping Xbox 360 and PS3 fans, Rockstar has confirmed \nCome October 20, Xbox One, PS4 and PC gamers will be able to visit Benny’s Original Motor Works, buy and customise new Lowriders models via their in-game phone and purchase a fourth property in Los Santos and Blaine County. \nPlayers will be able to make big modifications to the fleet of new vehicles, including decking out engine blocks with covers and air filters, coating interiors with velour, leather and patterns, while also getting to choose custom colours and designs for dials and new steering wheel and custom shift levers. \nIt's a big change to GTA 5's usual setup and is the second update released from Rockstar that really gives some original new options. ROCKSTAR GTA 5 fans on Xbox One and PS4 can look forward to deeper car customisation \nPlayers can give these cars hydraulics, boost stereo performance with new speakers and subs and open up the vehicle doors, hood and trunk with their in-game phones. \n\"Get stocked with the fully automatic Machine Pistol or Machete from Ammu-Nation,\" the announcement statement from Rockstar reads. \n\"The upwardly mobile can also expand their garage space and fleet of vehicles with the addition of the oft-requested fourth purchasable property. \n\"There’s also tons of new clothing, hair and accessory options as well as 3 new Adversary Modes and more.\" — Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) October 15, 2015 \nIt sounds like a lot of fun and unfortunately, none of it is for Xbox 360 and PS3 players. \nRockstar have warned in the past that hardware limitation would play a factor in when update would trail off for last-gen owners and it seems we have reached that point. \nIf you look at both the Freemode Events introduced earlier this year and now the GTA Online Lowrider update , they are both on a different level, providing fresh new options that were probably not possible on the older platforms.
