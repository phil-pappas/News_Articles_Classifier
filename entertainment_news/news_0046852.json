We’ve won. That’s it. That’s what you want to do,” Adkins said this week.\nForming in the early ’90s and breaking through to the mainstream a decade later with hits such as “The Middle,” “Sweetness” and “Pain,” Jimmy Eat World was a rock band that got in touch with its sensitive side, unafraid to wear emotion on its sleeves and crafting infectious songs to match. The genuine nature of the band’s songs has led to its continued success, Adkins said.\n“Us making an effort to always present an honest version of ourselves has enabled us to connect with people who find something in what we do on a level that doesn’t really need tastemakers or cool factor to sustain – whether or not we have a song on the radio, whether or not there’s a video that’s going around with us,” Adkins said.\nJimmy Eat World will play the one-day festival-style reboot of Taste of Chaos at San Manuel Amphitheater in Devore on Saturday alongside bands such as The Used, Dashboard Confessional and Temecula’s Finch, artists that similarly have maintained a devoted fan base and married rock and emotion in their music.\nA decade after the Taste of Chaos tour debuted, the one-day festival seeks to capture some of the magic of the biggest alternative-rock artists from the new millennium. Some of the lineup, including The Used and Orange County-rooted Thrice, were part of early iterations of the original Taste of Chaos tour, which had evolved into hard rock bordering on heavy metal by the end of its run in 2010.\nSaturday’s festival embraces its poppier side, with sets from the All-American Rejects and Saves the Day as well as Glassjaw, The Movielife, Story of the Year, Greek Fire and Adair. Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus will also perform a DJ set.\nWhile Adkins said he tries to approach everything as mentally new as possible, there are some similarities in playing festivals.\n“You’re playing to some of your most hard-core fans, but there’s stages in the crowd, sort of like a javelin-throw distance,” Adkins said.\nThe inner ring is made up of the devoted fans who have waited hours, through other bands, to stake a prime spot. The second circle is what he described as the “mildly interested” people. “And then you’re playing to the people who are walking from food to the other stage in the very, very back,” he said.\nThe band has been working on new music, Adkins said.\n“We’re not making records for some imaginary listener that is cool. We’re doing this all for basically us as listeners,” he said.\nAnd that philosophy has resonated with loyal fans.\n“While maybe it prevented us from ever achieving that level of stadium-rock stardom or blogger ‘Best band since Nirvana this week’ cool, it’s enabled us to have a career out of it,” Adkins said.\nContact the writer: vfranko@pe.com or @vanessafranko on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:58:25.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
