They were talking about a whole month in the Stone Age. Jeremy Clarkson (Richard Kendal/BBC/Hat Trick) \n“They said very sternly that after dealing with the stresses of a dying mother and the BBC television chief Danny Cohen and a lost job and a million other things besides, I was about to become a drooling vegetable. I must go immediately to a prison where there would be no contact with the outside world.” \nThe 55-year-old lost his beloved mother last year. At the time, he was on a Top Gear tour in Russia. \nFollowing the March 4 fracas with his former Top Gear colleague Oisin Tymon, in which the producer had his lip split and had to take himself to hospital, the BBC sacked Jeremy. James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson (Brian Lawless/PA) \nThe outspoken presenter joked that yoga was the worst part of his rehab experience: “To fill the yawning chasm between the 5am roll call and 10pm lights out, hours and hours of what I’ve now decided is the absolute worst thing in the world — yoga.” \nJeremy has signed a big money deal with Amazon Prime and will relaunch his career on the streaming platform with a new motoring show alongside former Top Gear co-stars James May and Richard Hammond.

To the delight of millions, he was verbally bashed by team captains Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, and by panellist Richard Osman.
