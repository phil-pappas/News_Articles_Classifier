That's right. Yeah.' ”\nOkay, I'm going to be very clear about something.\nHad I ever won an Oscar, I would not forget. And neither would anyone else, because I would carry it with me wherever I went, like Kramer with his Tony Award in an episode of Seinfeld.\nAnd as you'll recall, Kramer hadn't even really won a Tony. He merely was a seat-filler at the ceremony who accidentally got whisked onto the stage with the excited winners.\nAnyway, to be fair, Arquette – the star of CSI: Cyber , which airs Sundays on CBS and Tuesdays on CTV – had been asked if winning an Oscar had changed anything for her. So I do understand the point she was making in that context.\n“It's strange, I think the public and the press think it does change things drastically, but it doesn't really,” said Arquette, who won an Oscar earlier this year for her role in Boyhood. “You don't get all that many more offers.\n“I got offered a lot of movies that weren't put together completely, or didn't have their financing, or were first-time directors, or weren't, you know, completely all there. So it doesn't really change things.\n“It changes things in people's perception of how things should be different for you, and people's perception of your value. I've kind of struggled a little bit with that. It was so much, I just stayed home for a few months and hung out with my family, let it all simmer down.”\nArquette describes herself as a \"practical actor.\" She starred in Medium from 2005 to 2011, and more recently had a recurring role on Boardwalk Empire in 2013 and 2014, before joining CSI: Cyber as the series lead.\n“To be invited to be the first female middle-aged lead in a CSI, which is a global franchise, I realize that is important,” said Arquette, whose show has added Ted Danson this season, shifting over from the original CSI.\n“I like all genres, I like television, I like being in people's living rooms. I like network TV because I like that poor people can get it for free. I'm a little bit of a socialist in that way.\n“I'm really happy to be working. They'll kick you out soon enough, so you might as well work while you can. I also know that unless I'm Angela Lansbury, I probably won't have a series when I'm 70 years old. She may be the only person who's ever accomplished that.”\nArquette appeared on Inside Amy Schumer last April in a hilarious bit about gender in Hollywood. Arquette, Schumer, Tina Fey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus gathered to celebrate the latter's “last f---able day,” which supposedly is the day when the media officially decides that an actress isn't “believably f---able” anymore.\nOne of the signs that your “last f---able day” is approaching is when they start remaking your movies with “younger, more f---able” actresses. “They're remaking Boyhood with Selena Gomez in my part,” Arquette says.\nThat came on the heels of Arquette's Oscar acceptance speech last February, which got a lot of attention when she called for wage equality for women in America.\n“That part of it actually has changed my life, probably more than anything, (in that) I could really just be a full-time speaking person, which is weird, and I don't feel qualified for it, by the way,” Arquette said.\n“But then again, I don't know who is. I want to try to be of service if I can. I don't pretend to know everything. I don't feel like a hero, I just opened my mouth and said what's been going on.”\nHero or not, here are the facts, Patricia Arquette: You are the star of CSI: Cyber. And you won an Oscar. Yes, you did.\nNever forget it. Kramer wouldn't.\nTwitter: @billharris_tv\nbill.harris@sunmedia.ca\nPatricia Arquette talks 'CSI: Cyber' and why she loves TV\nBy Bill Harris , Postmedia Network First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 12:42 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 02:14 PM EDT\nPatricia Arquette of CSI: Cyber sometimes forgets she won an Oscar - um, say what?\nListening to Patricia Arquette, I immediately thought of Kramer.\n“I forget that I won an Oscar,” Arquette said. “I mean, every time people tell me, I'm like, 'You're right, I did.
