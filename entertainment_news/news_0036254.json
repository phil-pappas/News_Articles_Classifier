The 29-year-old model took to Instagram on Thursday to share a before-and-after wardrobe malfunction picture. The \" Lip Sync Battle \" commentator wore the same dress in the before-and-after picture. She wore an assymetrical off-the-shoulder jumpsuit with a mixture of satin suede. The image on the left saw Chrissy with slightly messy hair and gloomy facial expression. The hem of her wide pants swept the floor but it ripped on the crotch part which was apparently caused by her growing baby bump. The image on the right showed the model looking gorgeous at the fundraising event. Her pants looked shorter than those in the image on the left. She captioned it, \"Tailors are a miraculous thing. The hem of my pants became my crotch patch. #crotchpatch #belly thanks for the side by side, mom.\" Foto kiriman chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) pada Okt 22, 2015 pada 6:46 PDT It wasn't the first time John Legend 's wife opened up about her wardrobe malfunction. Back in June, Chrissy posted on the social media a picture of her covering her tearing slit with a Swarovski clutch purse at the 2015 CFDA Fashion Awards. At that time, she wrote, \"Wardrobe malfunction of the highest caliber. Let's just say the slit took it upon itself to rip 5 inches higher.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:05:51.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
