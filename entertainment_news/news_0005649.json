Rawls rushed for 169 yards on 23 carries -- including a 69-yard touchdown -- in Seattle's 27-24 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 5. But head coach Pete Carroll said the team will be leaning on Lynch versus the undefeated Panthers.\n\"He looked really back to full health,\" Carroll said of Lynch from the Virginia Mason Athletic Center on Friday.\nAll-Pro middle linebacker Bobby Wagner is officially listed as questionable for Sunday's matchup with 4-0 Carolina after suffering a strained pectoral muscle versus the Bengals.\n\"I can't tell you what's going to happen with this,\" Carroll said. \"(Wagner) did get some looks today and catch him up on the game plan and he moves around fine, but it's a shoulder/pec thing so we'll have to wait for game time to see if it's safe for him to play.\"\nWagner, who missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday and was limited on Friday, played all but two defensive snaps with the injury last week, but head coach Pete Carroll said the team wanted to think long-term on Sunday with another game coming up Thursday night at San Francisco.\n\"He's tough enough to play with it,\" Carroll said of Wagner. \"It's just whether it's the right thing to do to get him back to health. We need to judge that when we get right up to game time. With another game coming up Thursday, we need to take that into account as well. It might be a tough turnaround if he does play, so we'll just take in all the factors and figure that out.\"\nLinebacker depth may be an issue on Sunday, with Wagner's backup Brock Coyle also listed as questionable after missing practice on Wednesday and Friday with a knee injury.\nAdditionally, reserve Nick Moody sprained an ankle in practice on Wednesday, the same day he was added to the team's active roster from the practice squad.\nIf Wagner is unable to play, outside linebacker K.J. Wright will likely slide inside, with second-year pro Kevin Pierre-Louis playing Wright's traditional weakside spot. Pierre-Louis missed the Hawks' last two games with a hamstring injury, but was listed as probable on Friday.\nDefensive tackle Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder) was also listed as questionable after being limited in practice on Thursday and Friday, while defensive tackle Jordan Hill (quadriceps), cornerback Tye Smith (hip) and defensive end Frank Clark (hamstring) were listed as doubtful.\nClark, the team's second-round pick out of Michigan in 2015, has played in all five of the Seahawks' regular-season games thus far, picking up three tackles.\n\"He just got a slight strain, a first-degree type of strain in his hamstring that happened in workouts, so we just have to see how he is by gameday,\" Carroll said.\nCornerback Marcus Burley will miss his second-straight game after undergoing surgery to repair a broken thumb, and Carroll said free-agent signing Crezdon Butler, who signed with the team on Wednesday, was preparing to play.\nCarroll said that wide receiver Paul Richardson (knee) had a chance to return to practice from the physically unable to perform (PUP) list after Sunday's game, but that the upcoming Thursday night game complicated the decision.\n\"Again, it's a tricky week. If it was a normal week, I would have said yes,\" Carroll said. \"We just need to see, we'll wait and see how the game goes and we'll take in all that information. But he is 100 percent ready to roll. He's really ready to go, and we're excited to get him back out there.\"\nCarroll said that cornerback Jeremy Lane is a couple of weeks behind Richardson in his recovery from arm and knee injuries he suffered in Super Bowl XLIX.\nAfter their Week 6 matchup versus the Panthers, Seattle has five weeks to decide when to bring Richardson and Lane back to practice. Once any player on the PUP list returns to practice, the team has 21 days to decide whether to add the player to the active roster or keep them on the PUP list for the remainder of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:57:13.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
