Robin Miller | romiller@theadvocate.com \nJason Petty will pay tribute to the music of the American West in “The Swinging Cowboys” on Friday at Manship Theatre. The Swinging Cowboys Actor/musician Jason Petty’s tribute to the music of the Great American West WHEN: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 16. WHERE: Manship Theatre in the Shaw Center for the Arts, 100 Lafayette St. ADMISSION: $45. TICKETS/INFO: (225) 344-0334 or manshiptheatre.org . \nHis musical journey begins with the pioneers, progresses to Western Swing and ends with music by such contemporary western musicians as George Strait. \nAlong the way, he’ll discuss how modern country music has lost its way. The show is both music and storytelling carefully married to preserve music history while educating audience members in a fun way. And though Petty portrays some of the performers whose songs he sings, he’s never really in character. \n“I’m not trying to be them,” he said. “I’m just singing their songs.” \n“The Swinging Cowboys” will feature Petty backed by Carolyn Martin and her Texas Swing band. The show explores stories behind western music, including a look at the first cowboys in the West who avoided stampedes by soothing cattle with their music. The music soon became a staple of early saloons and was eventually recorded by such cowboy movie stars as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. \nThen came Texas Swing. \n“Morris Brown and Bob Wills invented Texas Swing in the era of big band,” Petty said. “People wanted to dance, and face it, you really couldn’t dance to Roy Acuff. It was a genre of music that grew from scratch. Bob Wills said he was just trying to find enough dance numbers for the dance halls.” \nBut Texas Swing’s popularity soared, becoming a part of the western music story. \n“And I think the stories are so important,” Petty said. “When you know the story behind the music, it makes a difference in how you listen to it.” \nSongs included in this show are “Home On The Range,”“Streets Of Laredo,”“Cattle Call,”“Don’t Fence Me In,”“Back In The Saddle” and “Take Me Back To Tulsa.” \n“Western music is different from country in that it’s about place,” Petty said. “It tells stories about the place, and it has the same storytelling qualities of Irish music. And western swing is like bluegrass music in that it has the best musicians — they’re second to none.” Get The Advocate in your inbox", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:14:40.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
