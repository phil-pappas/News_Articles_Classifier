The song is a let-down when it comes to the lyrics. The next song Ria sung by Rabbit Mac and Deepak is a slightly better move forward with a catchy hook and chorus, and has a slight dub step influence. This is followed by Kung Fu Kumaari sung by Deepak and Ramya Behara takes the tempo higher with two singers perfectly suiting the style of the song. The mass tinged number is sure to be a hit with the audiences, but the cheesy lyrics could have been done away with. The next song Laychalo sung by Megha and Thaman himself is a groovy number mixed with a beautiful melodious hook that is sure to linger in the mind for some time; classic Thaman! The last song Bruce Lee sung by Sameera Bharadwaj and Simha keeps up the energy of the soundtrack and Sameera's voice shines through the track. Apart from a couple of songs, the rest of the album is sure to strike a chord with the masses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:27:59.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
