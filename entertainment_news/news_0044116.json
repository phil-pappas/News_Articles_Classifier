That's exactly what happened Thursday in Ludlow, England, when Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino joined Prince Harry for the Walking With The Wounded trek. The former Miami Dolphins great is in Britain serving as an NFL ambassador for the league's International Series that begins with Sunday's game between the New York Jets and the Dolphins at London's Wembley Stadium. While taking a break from the walk to toss the pigskin back and forth, Harry couldn't resist also tossing out a line from the 1994 Jim Carrey comedy that also featured Marino in a small-but-memorable part. \"Laces out, Dan!\" Harry shouted as the pair and some other walkers threw the ball back and forth. The line references a beef the villain in \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" had with Marino over a fictional failed field goal attempt that cost the Dolphins a Super Bowl. \nWalking With the Wounded is a 1,000-mile, 72-day trek across Great Britain to raise awareness about servicemen wounded in duty. Marino joined Harry on a 17-mile stretch of the trek in western England. The expedition will wrap up Nov. 1 in London at Buckingham Palace. That's Prince Harry (in the middle) yelling \"laces out, Dan!\" while playing catch with Dan Marino. #NFLUK https://t.co/YuVyEQTsAZ — NFL UK (@nfl_uk) October 1, 2015 Prince Harry throwing the ???? with @DanMarino .
