Janet Jackson bans Instagram use on Unbreakable World Tour? \nJanet Jackson has reportedly stopped her fans from taking photos and videos at her concert and posting them on Instagram. \nJanet Jackson has reportedly banned people from posting videos and photos of her concerts on Instagram. \nSeveral fans have received emails with a message saying ''a third party reported that the content violates their copyright'' and other social media users have had their accounts suspended, according to The Guardian newspaper. \nAnd one fan told the New York Post newspaper: ''Five emails from Instagram about the five videos I had posted. It seems like Miss Jackson's [legal] team is on fire. What a shame they don't understand the times we live in.'' \nHowever, the publication reported that the photo sharing app claimed people's accounts were being deactivated due to a ''bug'' and was not done on purpose or for legal reasons. \nA spokesperson for the company said: ''We have identified a bug that resulted in the removal of accounts that shouldn't have been removed. \n''We have fixed the bug and are in the process of restoring the impacted accounts.'' \nThe singer - who is currently on her 'Unbreakable World Tour' - will bring her live show to the UK in March 2016. \nA representative for the singer is yet to respond to the claims.
