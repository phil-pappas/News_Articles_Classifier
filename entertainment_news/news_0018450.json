She says the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. \nCosby's attorneys have not commented on her lawsuit. \nKarlan said in his ruling that he was troubled by the mistake by Huth's previous lawyer, but despite that he felt Cosby could still get a fair trial. \nHuth's former attorney, Marc Strecker, acknowledged he overlooked a portion of the legal code that states claims by adult plaintiffs that they were victims of underage sexual abuse should omit the defendant's real name. \"I made a mistake,\" Strecker said. \nLos Angeles prosecutors declined to file charges against Cosby over Huth's allegations, citing the statute of limitations. Prosecutors are reviewing Goins' allegations for a possible case. \nThe AP doesn't normally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse, but Huth and Goins have both come forward publicly in their lawsuits and at news conferences. \nKarlan also ruled Wednesday that Cosby's upcoming deposition in the Huth case will remain under seal until a December hearing. Cosby is scheduled to be deposed Friday. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:53:02.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
