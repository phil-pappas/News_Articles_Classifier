The events main stage will be located at Santander Bank, 257 New Dorp Lane.\n“I am really looking forward to seeing New Dorp Lane and Plaza full of Staten Islanders again,” said Councilman Steven Matteo. “Our food crawl earlier this year brought over one thousand borough residents to the Lane, and I believe our second Columbus Day event will be a great celebration of Italian-Americans and Italian culture. I know Maria Esposito, the New Dorp Merchants Group, the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation, PRcision, and my staff put together a great day of activities for people take part in.”\nLast year’s event was well attended, and organizers are expecting an even bigger turn out this time around.\n“Last year over 800 people joined us at our event to celebrate Columbus Day, and the beauty of New Dorp Lane,” said Maria Esposito, President of the New Dorp Lane Merchants Group and Owner of Norman Heil Insurance, Inc. “This year we’ve added some new elements, including bocce ball sponsored by BCB Community Bank and Schneider Realty Services, and a few other surprises for guests to enjoy.”\nLocal performances will also be featured including Mrs. Rosemary’s Dance Studio, Dream Dance Studio, Dragon Kim’s Karate School, and the New Dorp High School Cheerleaders.\nThe Columbus Day Festival has become the signature event for the Merchants Group. The merchants emphasize that not only are their events an enjoyable time for the community, but they serve a greater purpose as well. Daniel Clark, SIEDC’s Project Manager for the Group, explains “Events like these show people how local businesses can play a crucial role in contributing to a well-rounded community. New Dorp Lane & Plaza are important centers of activity on the Island, not only as economic hubs, but as central gathering places. We encourage people from all across the Island to take a stroll past our shops and restaurants on a fall afternoon, and take advantage of this iconic Staten Island neighborhood.”\nIn addition to the festivities taking place that day, people are encouraged to register online at http://www.NewDorpMerchants.org for a chance to win a prepaid “New Dorp Bucks” Visa Gift card.
