Pollock and friend Karl Hofmann started Simplified Building Concepts in 2006, selling building components online. It was Hofmann’s father-in-law — Mike Mumau, president of Kee Safety — who suggested Pollock and Hofmann start up the website to sell Kee products.\n“The industrial sector was very slow to uptake on the e-commerce realm, so we were able to build a Web presence around these components that no one else had done up until that point,” said Pollock, who had been a computer engineering student at RIT.\nThe two started the company from scratch with no outside funding, and did $180,000 worth of sales in their first year. Although Hofman left the company in 2007, Pollock continued on, and last year, the company had $7 million in revenue. This year, the business landed itself on the Inc. 5000, a list of the fastest-growing private companies in the country.\nIn 2009, Pollock started a second section of the business called Simplified Safety to focus exclusively on fall protection solutions.\n“The growth we’ve been experiencing doesn’t come from executing the same strategy year over year. We started off simply selling components and now we sell systems, components and products from lots of different companies,” says Pollock, a 19th Ward resident.\nWe spoke with Pollock recently about marketing, areas of growth in his business and more.\nBuilding trust among colleagues/employees: “In the beginning, a lot of our employees were our friends. We feel a lot of the reason we were successful was that we had the trust and love with each other to work out the differences across some gaps. Now as we’re growing, we have to bring in people who don’t have those established relationships, so how do you create that trust and those relationships? We’ve moved everyone into our office, instead of having half work remotely like last year.”\nFocusing on scaling the business: “We’re trying to adapt the way we’re working to accommodate the growth of our business. We used to have a lot of people doing very generalist kind of work. Sales guys would write the Quote: , interact with the customer and do the follow-up. We’re transitioning to having sales guys focus more specifically on managing the customer relationship. Technical people focus more on generating an accurate Quote: . So we’re breaking the process down to enable us to be able to scale as we grow.”\nOn lead generation: “We’re 100 percent lead generation through the Internet. Our route to market is through people searching the Web. Our sales force is predominantly responsive. We don’t have people cold calling or out there doing a lot of on-the-street work. That marketing section of the business drives the leads and the salespeople help to configure and understand the needs and the situation.”\nOn marketing: “We’ve created a blog because that’s how e-commerce runs these days. Content marketing is a big part of the business driver — releasing good content that is helpful, educational, assists other people but also exposes people to the idea of your product. So we focus a lot on deploying new content or finding existing content for our website. That’s how you have to stay alive.”\nOn harnessing existing relationships: “We really don’t have repeat customers at this point. I see that as a big area of growth for us, moving forward. We’ve had this huge stream of customers over the past nine years, and there are tons of relationships in there, and I don’t know that we’ve done a good job at harnessing those to continue to drive sales. So getting a structure in place and developing our process to do more repeat business is a priority.”\nFor more information: Simplified Safety, Inc., 803 West Ave. #128.
