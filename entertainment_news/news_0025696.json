'Octet' is heart of ensemble's repertoire 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nThe Academy of St. Martin in the Fields is a powerful brand in the classical music world. \nFounded in 1958 at a church in London's Trafalgar Square, the small orchestra was a breath of fresh air, with its light, transparent style and squeaky-clean technical prowess. \nRecordings - the orchestra has made more than 500 of them - soon made the Academy, as it's often simply called, world famous. \nIn 1967, the orchestra created a spin-off group, the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields Chamber Ensemble , a flexible group made up of the orchestra's principal players. \nIt's this small group, currently numbering just eight musicians, that Chamber Music Houston will host on Tuesday at Rice University 's Stude Concert Hall. The ensemble will play Franz Schubert 's \"Octet for Winds and Strings,\" Giacchomo Rossini's \"String Sonata No. 1\" and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's \"Horn Quintet.\" More Information \nAcademy of St. Martin in the Fields Chamber Ensemble \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday \nWhere: Stude Concert Hall, Shepherd School of Music, Rice University \nTickets: $20-$80; 713-348-5400, chambermusichouston.org \nViolist Robert Smissen , who has been a member of the Academy for three decades, spoke from Cleveland about the ensemble and its current tour. \nQ: What are the ensemble's artistic goals? \nA: The artistic goals are to enjoy playing music that we all adore! The chamber ensemble gives the principal players an opportunity to play and record the chamber repertoire, from quintets through to octets. \nQ: How active is the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields Chamber Ensemble? \nA: We come over to the States for a tour almost every year. We also have London engagements, and we tour in Europe, as well. But the chamber ensemble has to fit around the schedule of the main orchestra. Although we may not perform as frequently as some established string quartets, we all play regularly within the larger orchestra. So we're used to each other, but without the difficult relationships that can sometime develop within a quartet, when you're seeing each other day in and day out. \nQ: How would you describe the ensemble's style these days? \nA: I think our style bleeds over from the Academy's style. Without blowing our own trumpet too much, I'd say there are certain default settings we expect from everyone: a homogenous sound and everyone thoroughly understanding the score. On top of that, we're open to discussion about interpretation. Also, everything we play is very well considered because many of the players have played these pieces with other ensembles, so they bring their own experience and interpretations to the melting pot. \nQ: How did you decide on the repertoire for the current tour? \nA: Once we decided to tour with the Schubert \"Octet,\" which is an enormous piece, we looked for other pieces to fit in with it. There are many pieces we could have chosen, but we wanted the first half to be a kind of light, amuse-bouche for the \"Octet.\" \nIt's a real treat to tour with this music. We're performing the Schubert \"Octet\" on 15 nights, and it's fabulous to explore music in this way. We can really get under the skin of the music, and hopefully that shows in our performances \nQ: It sounds like you're in the midst of a pretty big tour. \nA: We're over here for three weeks. We've already played in Dallas and now we're in Cleveland. We're going to up Canada and out to California, so it's pretty hectic. \nWe've played in Houston many times, and we're very much looking forward to returning. We know the hall, and we know the audience. It's a little bit of a home away from home in the middle of a very busy schedule.
