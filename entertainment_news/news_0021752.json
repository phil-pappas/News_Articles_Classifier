More than three-thousand athletes were in Chattanooga for the 7 Bridges Marathon and Half Marathon on Sunday. This was the fifth year for the downtown event sponsored by the Seventh Day Adventist Church.The race was commentated by News Channel 9's Beth Neuhoff along with long time runner, Tim Bell and streamed live on You Tube and Channel 62 WDSI MyTV.The marathon and half-marathon saw record numbers of runners this year. The 5K was sold out. A 1K fun run took families around Coolidge Park where one little boy garnered a standing ovation as he finished with the aid of a walker.A marathon relay was also a part of the line up. People joined up to complete the marathon relay style as a team.One of several highlights of Sunday's race was Daniel Semsel who drove in from Dayton Ohio to run his 3rd marathon in 8 days. Semsel has competed in 53 marathons in 47 states all while carrying a large American flag. He runs to honor his fellow Air Force and other members of the military that have been killed. Sunday's run was to honor a female Airforce helicopter pilot killed last week in Afghanistan. Stemsel had her picture pinned to his back. He says a prayer for the fallen before and after the he runs in their honor.The finish line was only the starting point for a very public proposal. Chris Marshall dropped to one knee and popped the question. His girlfriend, Amani, said 'yes' as the crowd cheered. Both had just finished their first marathon in under 5 hours after training only 6 months.The top overall male and female marathon finishers based on gun elapsed time were from Alabama. They are Matthew Leonard and Lorna Wilson. The oldest runners made a new friend during the 5k race. Herbert Ingersoll, 88, and Philip Lewis, 83, completed their first 5k's. Ingersoll took up running at age 50 and hasn't stopped. He wants everyone to know that age shouldn't be the excuse. All races started and finished by near the Chattanooga Theatre Centre. The marathon crossed 7 bridges and the half marathon crossed 4 bridges. 7 Bridges Marathon a Success Monday, October 19 2015, 09:04 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:18:45.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
