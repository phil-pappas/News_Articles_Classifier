Director Robert Icke's production \"Oresteia\" transferred in August from the tiny Almeida to the West End, where it is reaching much larger audiences.\nBut wrenching ancient Greek dramas into the 21st century, as these productions have done with modern language, contemporary settings and by introducing modern plot points, has also served to underscore how tricky it can be to modernize the ancients.\nFor example, would a ruler of any modern civilized country sacrifice his daughter in order to assure success in battle, as Agamemnon does in \"Oresteia\"?\nIcke told an interviewer he saw the work, in which the sacrifice sets off a chain reaction of murders, including her mother Clytemnestra killing Agamemnon, as being like \"The Sopranos\" - but would Tony kill his own daughter?\nIn what is perhaps an overcorrection from the bloodiness of \"Oresteia\", Cusk, who famously wrote of her animal instinct to keep her children when she was divorced from her photographer husband some years ago, has taken a liberty or two in the usual ending of \"Medea\".\nMaybe Cusk did not think it necessary to go for the full bloodbath, since she had already made the point several times that women are pawns in a man's world, in Euripides's time or now.\n\"Did you know beauty is a mirror, a trick the Gods have devised?\" the messenger (Charlotte Rundle, made up to be half male, half female), says in the play's closing moments.\nThe penis is where the battle between right and wrong is fought, she says, noting: \"Truth must win the bout, or all hell is let loose.\"\nIn this production Medea exposes the truth, and gets her revenge, but audiences familiar with the play may wish a little more hell had been let loose.\n(Michael Roddy is the Entertainment Editor for Reuters in Europe.
