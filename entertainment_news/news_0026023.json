(Photo: Drew Davis / ArtPrize Seven) \nA Michigan woman won the top ArtPrize honor on Friday, her second time in the last three years.\nIn the seventh annual “radically open” international art competition, Loveless PhotoFiber — attributed to Ann and Steven Loveless of Frankfort — took the $200,000 grand prize through the public vote for “Northwood Awakening,” a collaborative piece at Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum.\nThe other $200,000 grand prize, awarded through a jury vote of art experts, went to “Higher Ground” by New York-based artist Kate Gilmore.\nThe ArtPrize winners were revealed Friday night at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre. Some 1,550 entries representing 48 countries as well as 42 U.S. states and territories vied for awards, organizers said.\nSince Sept. 23, 35,481 visitors cast 422,763 votes in two voting rounds, beating last year’s totals by more than 24,000, ArtPrize officials said Friday.\nOn top was “Northwood Awakening,” which ArtPrize described as “a large photographic print and quilt hybrid, depicting a serene woodland panorama, that seamlessly blends the combined textile and photo skills of Loveless PhotoFiber.” The work also was listed atop the Two-Dimensional category entries.\nAnn Loveless also won the public vote’s grand prize in 2013 for “Sleeping Bear Dune Lakeshore.”\n“Once again, reverence for technical skill in two-dimensional work — this time in a stunning combination of large-scale photography and intricate textile — has captured the imagination of the voting public,” ArtPrize Executive Director Christian Gaines said in a statement. “It’s a surprising and unexpected twist to have ‘Northwood Awakenings’ represent our first ever two-time public vote winner. We’re stunned and delighted, but we’re also reflecting on how this affects ArtPrize going forward.”\nOther public vote winners, who each earned $12,500, were: “Greatest Generation/Beta Team/November” by Fred Cogelow of Willmar, Minnesota, in the Three-Dimensional category; “REACH and SPLASH” by Andy Sacksteder of Port Clinton, Ohio, in the Installation category; and “Whisper,” by Emily Kennerk of Zionsville, Indiana, in the Time-based category.\nThe juried awards also were announced Friday. Gilmore won the Juried Grand Prize for a transformational performance juror Dan Cameron called “really kind of magical in a way that we’ve maybe lost sight of.”\n\"Hometown Hero\" is touchable art. The work invites involvement. By adding a name, date, or tiny doodles to the Stars and Stripes, visitors have an opportunity to commemorate the life of their hero. Not every hero wears a uniform or a red cape. Sometimes a small act of kindness goes unnoticed. Artist Pamela Alderman.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen \"Balancing Act\" is a life-size rock sculpture installation in the reflecting pool at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The illusion is that stacks of balanced rocks are supported by columns of water. The rocks are fountains themselves with water coming out of the top stones. There is lots of water action and sound with this installation. Artist Calvin Babich.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen The vision and mission for \"BREAKTHROUGH\" is to raise awareness of mental illness and fight the stigma on a personal and community level. The community is invited to participate in the creation of the artwork by visiting our \"breaking studio\" where they may break ceramics as a symbolic gesture of accepting and breaking down old and dysfunctional paradigms free of judgment or shame. Artist Breakthrough Team.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Historic photos of Grand Rapids are re-photographed as the scenes appear today. Printed on sheer fabric, the old photo hangs directly in front of the present-day image on cotton canvas and offers viewers the illusion of looking through the past into the present. They see the same scene, at the same time, from two different time periods. Artist Bolt & Gunnick  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Artist Judith Braun's statement: With my fingers dipped in charcoal I draw on the wall creating patterns of fingerprints. Some are abstractions of flora and foliage, and some evoke light and energy. On one hand they are Burchfield-esque landscapes, on the other they are meditations on touch and underlying structures of our universe.   Drew Davis Fullscreen Portrait of a fine Belgian equine and two friends. Based on combined/altered photo compositions with concocted background and hame. Carved in butternut. A \"high-mezzo\" relief, carved from a 4-inch base slab with laminations to right arm and part of the gate employed as a framing element at bottom. Artist Fred Cogelow.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen \"Triple Play\" is a series of tiger paintings done with acrylic on canvas. They are a work in progress and will be finished soon. I named them \"Triple Play\" because this event in a baseball game is so rare, like the Siberian tigers are becoming in the wild. Artist Anni Crouter.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen The works within \"Symphony of Gestures\" use exaggerated forms to explore the communal aspects of music creation and offer the viewer a renewed awareness of the human body, while providing a playful and meditative atmosphere where the norms of musical traditions are defied in an absurd fashion. Artists Sara Dittrich and Benjamin Buchanan.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen \"Whisper\" is about conversations: The conversations we have with ourselves or others and exploring how we respond. The viewer activates the sculpture by softly whispering into the microphone. The voice is expressed in a silent vibration, no audible words, only to be perceived by the chattering and clinking of the dishes on the table. Artist Emily Kennerk.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen \"Rolling Down\" is a waterfall created out of wood, inspired by the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his last address before he was tragically assassinated: \"Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\" \"Rolling Down\" is also a reflection on the current events in our society, highlighting the strife and tragedy coming out of competing ideologies, over-reactive authorities, lingering suspicions, and prejudicial actions. Artist Kroeze Krew.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Using Petoskey stones and fossils, a framed two-dimensional display with a square shape that measures approximately 9 feet tall by 9 feet wide with a depth of approximately 4 inches and a weight near 700 pounds. Subject matter is the state of Michigan map with all 83 counties. Artist Randall Libby.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Our piece represents the renewal of flora in our Northernwoods forests as it awakens from winter hibernation. First the leeks sprout and are soon followed by Dutchman's breeches, hepatica, Jack-in-the-pulpit, morel mushrooms and trillium. The freshness in the air and the wash of soft to vibrant greens pushing through the ground cover of dead leaves and the trees just beginning to bud awaken our senses and energize us. It gives us a feeling of renewal in our own lives as we hike the many trails in Benzie County like we have also been awakened from our hibernation. Artist Loveless PhotoFiber.  Drew Davis/ArtPrizet Fullscreen My project is a time-based piece that I hope will be captivating to a large audience. The art will be in constant motion throughout the entirety of ArtPrize. It consists of several \"hands\" made with latex gloves that are installed floating on water. The hands have a small mechanism inside which allows them to move and turn freely through space, making each viewer's experience unique. Artist Craig Merchant  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen \"Hwan\" means \"Maya\" in Sanskrit. It is an illusion similar to the transmitted image from a projector. The true entity is revealed only when the projection is blocked, leaving the blank surface. Ultimately, everything seemingly existent is nonexistential. There are two spaces. None for the dead, and for the living, or for those dreaming, and for those awake. I question where we are among these spaces. Statement by artist Seungmo Park.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Walk around the tree to take in all seasons represented in a combination of different color schemes of ornaments and decorations. See raindrops falling in spring, leaves in autumn and snowflakes in winter. The tree is made of over 1,000 pieces of colorful materials suspended on fluorocarbon lines. The lines are attached to grids which are hung in a pergola. \"Seasons\" took over a year to conceptualize, gather and prep materials, and then finally sculpt. Artist Robin Protz  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen I've named my two bronze statues \"REACH\" and \"SPLASH\" and they are my tribute to youth and spontaneity. The story they tell is of two teenage kids who took a hike on an unknown path. When they came upon a rope swing dangling out over the water, they kicked off their shoes, reached for the rope, and took the plunge. Artist Andy Sacksteder  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen : We are drawing a portrait of this stretch of Grand Rapids being momentarily disrupted by a fanciful swarm of giant fish descending to the sidewalk to steal everyone's wheels. City buses, tandem bikes, skateboards, razor scooters, roller skates and horse carriages are snatched from the streets. Every person and wheeled object in the drawing are portraits drawn from life. For close to two weeks we have been outside 14 hours a day talking with the public and drawing. Statement by The Tape Crew  Artist Andy Sacksteder Fullscreen \"The Race\" consists of three bicycles made completely out of wood and a 1970s photo of the artist; racing each other and racing into the future. Many types of wood were used in this project, including, oak, ash, mahogany, aspen, maple and bamboo. Artist Kurt Swanson.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen \"SENSI\" is a memorable experience. It is the boundary between old and contemporary. A universal representation of the five senses. A global image read by every individual on the planet regardless of his cultural background. \"SENSI\" is a tribute to human specificity, a didactic anthology of how we perceive the world through an aesthetic image of the senses. Artist Gianluca Traina.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Artist Kurt Swanson's statement: \"In a Promised Land\" revisits the aftermath of the horrific Tulsa race riot of 1921, which left Black Wall Street -- the most affluent black community in America at that time -- in ruin. What's even more unnerving is that many survey courses of American and African-American history have omitted this. One has to wonder how this is even possible, but in the American conscience, forgetting has always been easier than remembering.  Drew Davis/ArtPrize Fullscreen Like this topic?
