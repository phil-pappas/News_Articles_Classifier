In a chat with Zane Lowe for Beat 1 radio, the chart-topping singer explained that it would be the last time she named albums after her age. \"I think this will be my last age one,\" she said. The Grammy winner added, \"I'm sure I'm wrong with this, but I feel like there's been a massive change in me in the last couple of years. Having become a parent, and me and all my friends suddenly living grown-up lives and having responsibilities we haven't had before.\" \"I feel like how I feel about myself is how I'm going to feel about myself forever,\" she went on. \"I feel like the idea of naming albums after my age is always to show a photograph of what's going on in my life [at that time]. I feel like not that much is going to change profoundly in me from now on, in terms of how important years of my life are to myself.\" \"I think the next one is probably going to be called Adele. The real me,\" the mother of one said before quickly adding, \"I'm just kidding.\" Adele will release \"25\" on November 20. She just rolled out the first single titled \"Hello\" along with a music video. She made history with the visuals directed by Xavier Dolan. It became \"the 1st music video to be filmed with IMAX cameras.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:57:24.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
