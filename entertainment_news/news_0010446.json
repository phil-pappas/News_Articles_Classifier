Photo: Colin Page \nIt's widely acknowledged as one of the great musicals of the 20th century, but Larry Gelbart's​ City of Angels has never had a main stage production in Australia.\nNow, 25 years after the show took out multiple Tony awards (including best musical, best book, and best score) we'll finally get to see what all the fuss is about. Next month, Life Like Company will stage a limited season of the show that had almost 900 performances on Broadway and a nine-month run on the West End.\nWritten by Gelbart (best known for Tootsie and TV series M*A*S*H ) and with music by Broadway and jazz legend Cy Coleman, ( Sweet Charity ), City of Angels is no ordinary musical.\nSet in the steamy world of 1940s Hollywood, it's really two shows in one; one narrative follows the story of Stine, a pulp crime novelist lured to Los Angeles with the promise of turning his crime novel City of Angels into a Hollywood blockbuster, while trying to balance his failing marriage and his overbearing producer, Buddy Fidler.\nAdvertisement The other, playing concurrently, is the live enactment of his screenplay; Stine's fictional hero is gumshoe detective Stone, who enacts each scene on stage. When Stone starts to resent his creator, things take a turn for the meta, as it were, when he begins interacting with Stine.\nAll of the cast (which also includes Chelsea Plumley, Rohan Browne and Amanda Harrison), appear in both \"shows\" at once.\nIf that's not challenging enough, the two stories are acted out on a \"split\" stage – one half in exaggerated, vibrant technicolour, the other – the movie scenes – in black and white.\nAnton Berezin​ (a veteran of musicals including Cats, Anything Goes and Once The Musical ) plays Stine, while singer and actor Kane Alexander is Stone.\nWhen he wrote his musical comedy-thriller  in the late '80s, Gelbart said it was fuelled by his own grievances as a screenwriter; the work both honours and satirises the Hollywood film system of the 1940s.\n\"I don't think there's anybody in the writing community that likes the writer's role in the ... movie business,\" he said.\n\"The phrases have gotten a little grander but the practices haven't grown any less shabby.\"\nBerezin says City Of Angels has long been a cult favourite among musical theatre performers, even though it's only ever had amateur productions here.\n\"I started my career in musicals in the early 1990s and when I was starting out with auditions, it was all about City of Angels – that and (songs from) Les Mis was what everyone was singing for their auditions ... so singing some of these songs is a bit of a dream come true,\" he says.\n\"For us, in our early 20s and late teens, this show was what it was all about.\"\nHe and his partners in Life Like, wife Theresa Borg​ and business director Troy Sussman​, wanted to stage something new, something that would excite \"hard core musical theatre fans\".\n\" City of Angels jumped out; it's so iconic and the music is amazing,\" he says.\nAnd no easy feat to stage.\n \"The show lives in two worlds, and that's created through lighting and costumes,\" says Berezin.\n\"The sets are obviously very important but really, it's mostly about lights and costumes.\"\nThe show also boasts two separate scores – one  with typical musical theatre tropes (and wickedly funny lyrics) and the other a \"soundtrack\", in true film noir style. \nFor opera and jazz singer Kane Alexander, performing Cy Coleman's songs is a thrill. Alexander spent years living in New York and performing in jazz clubs,  and describes the musical's score as \"totally his world\".\n\"I'm really looking forward to getting my teeth into the repertoire and I know it well – I first heard the score in high school and Cy Coleman comes from that old jazz world that I love,\" he says.\n\"The score is a mix of sexy jazz and it's got that cinematic vibe as well.\"\nUnusually, Alexander started his career as an opera singer before moving to jazz and into acting. As well as varied musical roles and touring with Il Divo, he's appeared on Neighbours and Blue Heelers . He says the show is a witty celebration of film noir. \n\"Which is such an iconic style, and the script is fantastic; all delicious dialogue and voice-​overs,\" he says. \"It's quite intellectual, the way the story is seen through the author's eyes, with his imagination playing out on one side – it's really an insight into the writer's mind. It's an interesting way to tell a story; I've never seen anything quite like it before, particularly in musical theatre.\"\nBerezin agrees it's unusual to see such meta-theatrical devices in a musical comedy.\n\"The ideas here are really cool, with Stine's inner monologue expressed as a dialogue between the artist and his art,\" he says.\n\"It's an interesting take on the idea that the world is made of thought and imagining worlds into being.\"\nCity of Angels is at the Playhouse Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, November 5-8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:30:23.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
