Humira is an injectable.\nLilly sounded a similar note.\n\"If approved, baricitinib could help change expectations for people living with this debilitating disease,\" said David Ricks, Lilly's senior vice president.\nAnalysts questioned the new drug's safety because during the clinical trial baricitinib racked up serious adverse events at a similar rate as a placebo, but higher than Humira.\n\"We are particularly interested in the detailed safety data from the trial and also long-term safety, which we believe would be a major driver\" for sales of baricitinib for treating rheumatoid arthritis, wrote Dr. Mark Schoenebaum, a drug and biotech analyst at Evercore ISI in New York.\nHumira, which accounted for about two-thirds of AbbVie's revenues of $19.9 billion last year, is approved to treat nine conditions, making it one of the most prescribed drugs on the market. But it will lose its patent exclusivity late next year, meaning it will likely face competition from biosimilars.\nMorningstar estimates AbbVie could lose nearly 40 percent of its revenue by 2020. Seven biosimilars are in late-stage development.\nAbbVie said that Humira has a comprehensive record of clinical effectiveness, a \"well-studied safety profile\" and breadth of approved uses \"that will ensure it remains a strong, sustainable growth brand.\"\njrussell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @johnrussell99\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Drug Research Drugs and Medicines Medical Research Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ec304/turbine/ct-humira-under-threat-10151-biz-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:07:45.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
