His legal team has sent a cease and desist letter to New York Daily News after his nude shots began spreading online on Wednesday, October 7. According to the cease and desist letter obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Justin's legal team is demanding the removal of the nude pictures from New York Daily News' website within 12 hours. The pictures haven't been removed from the site yet. Justin's legal team says the publication of the nude photos is a violation of the singer's publicity and privacy rights. The photos also infringe on the \"What Do You Mean\" singer's trademarks. The cease and desist letter acknowledges that the nude photos are indeed Justin's, despite some speculation that the shots were photoshopped to look like him. \"We recently became informed that your company has obtained and is distributing unauthorized photographs of our Client including images showing him without clothing,\" the letter reads. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Browse Justin Bieber Pictures More Justin Bieber News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:01:35.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
