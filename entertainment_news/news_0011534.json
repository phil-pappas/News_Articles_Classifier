Buy Now CASEY KREIDER | Staff Photographer \nBailey, 3, left, and Marley, 10, right, are bonded and seek to be adopted together from the Humane League of Lancaster County. \nBailey and Marley want to supersize the love in your life! \nThis dynamic duo came into the shelter when their family’s living circumstances changed and they could no longer take care of the two dogs. \nBailey is a 3-year-old boxer and her brother, Marley, is a 10-year-old German shepherd mix. Because the two dogs are bonded to each other and cry when apart, we would love to find a home that would open their hearts to both of them. \nBoth dogs enjoy playing fetch and, although Marley is the senior of the two, he is a young dog at heart who enjoys going for walks with his sister. Bailey and Marley are housebroken, know some basic commands and enjoy treats and attention. \nMarley and Bailey are available for adoption today at the Humane League of Lancaster County, 2195 Lincoln Highway E. Regular shelter hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday-Saturday. Many of our available animals can also be viewed online at humaneleague.com . Call the League at 393-6551. \nWe would like to thank everyone who came out Saturday to make our annual Tailwagger’s Trot a huge success. It was a day filled with music, vendors, lots of fun, and, of course, our four-legged friends. Best of all, the event helped to raise funds and awareness to improve the lives of animals and the people who love them. We appreciate the hard work and support of our volunteers and the community!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:48:06.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
