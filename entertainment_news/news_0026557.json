After 20 years in the research and consulting fields, and 15 years at the helm of Arab Advisors Group, Jawad Abbassi, Founder and General Manager of Arab Advisors Group, will depart the research and analysis field. \n\nFollowing his role at Arab Advisors, Jawad will maintain an active role in the regional and global TMT sectors, as the Head of MENA in GSMA. \n\n\"Leaving the management of the company I founded 15 years ago, is a bitter sweet threshold. The team of Arab Advisors Group has contributed greatly and meaningfully to the TMT sector in the Arab World. The company grew in size and reputation and continues to be a pillar of reliable research, analysis and thought leadership in the region. I am confident that the team I leave behind at Arab Advisors and the new GM will continue to contribute greatly to the industry as well as generating excellent consistent returns to shareholders, myself included!\". \n\nBack in September, 2005, the Arab Jordan Investment Bank (AJIB) and Arab Advisors Group had concluded an agreement by which AJIB buys a 55% stake in Arab Advisors Group. The cash transaction allowed AJIB and the Arab Advisors Group to leverage strategic synergies to enhance the quality and scope of services of Arab Advisors Group. Arab Advisors Group -a private shareholding company registered in Jordan- is currently owned by the Arab Jordan Investment Bank (55%) and Mr. Jawad Abbassi (45%).\n\nTo date, Arab Advisors Group has served 720 global and regional companies by providing reliable research analysis and forecasts of Arab communications markets to these clients.
