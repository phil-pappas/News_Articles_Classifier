When he brought up this idea of Dance with Peter, I doubted initially, but he stuck to his guns, and look at where we are now.’ \nOn what is responsible for their success over the years, Paul said, ‘God made it possible. There’s also this thing about P-Square; we take our career serious. It started as fun, but it became business, and later, it became about the fans.’ \n‘Yes, we’re super stars, but you’re not a super star without super fans. We don’t have any competition; we only compete with ourselves. If you’re competing with P-Square, you’re wasting your time.’ \nIt should be recalled that Peter had also recently stated that the next phase for the brothers would be ‘Sing with Paul.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:41:40.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
