The American dream pop duo managed to keep the project a secret and unprecedented because they just released their fifth studio album \" Depression Cherry \" in late August this year. Beach House shared via Twitter on Wednesday, October 7, \"We are releasing our 6th full length LP on October 16th!!! It's called Thank Your Lucky Stars . More info soon.\" But the band refused to call it a surprise album. \"Just becuz we didn't send the record to press 6 months before its release does not make it a surprise,\" Beach House said on Twitter. \"Fans/press hear it at the same time.\" Regarding the speculation whether it's some leftovers from the previous effort, Beach House explained, \"We are very excited, it's an album being released the way we want. It's not a companion to depression cherry or a surprise or b-sides.\" The band also posted on Instagram a potential cover art of the album. It's a black-and-white vintage photo of a young girl holding a doll in box. \"We are happy to announce that 'Thank Your Lucky Stars' is coming out on vinyl and digitally on October 16th!\" they captioned it.
