BBC \nTributes are being paid to two giants from television's \"Golden Age\" of the 1970s, following news that BBC presenter Hugh Scully and ITN newsreader Gordon Honeycombe have both died. Scully, 72, died in Cornwall on Thursday (8 October) and Honeycombe, 79, died in Australia today (9 October). \nScully joined the BBC in 1965, co-presenting Nationwide before joining the Antiques Roadshow which he co-presented for 19 years before resigning to join an antiques auction house. It had been feared the new position may compromise the programme's neutrality. On leaving the show he said: \"I have particularly enjoyed my long association with the Antiques Roadshow, which has always been a delight and one of the best jobs in broadcasting.\" Gordon Honeycombe, former ITN newscaster, has died aged 79 http://t.co/ogjGmwZwuv pic.twitter.com/RJi3nvuj9I — ITV News (@itvnews) October 9, 2015 \nBBC Media and Arts correspondent David Sillito tweeted: \"Sad news - the BBC TV presenter Hugh Scully has died. 19 years on Antiques Roadshow and of course Spotlight and Nationwide in the 70s.\" We are saddened to hear the news of the death of Hugh Scully >> http://t.co/QkkdfM5ZIi — Antiques Roadshow (@BBC_ARoadshow) October 9, 2015 \nNewsreader Gordon Honeycombe, who was also a successful author, worked for ITV between 1965 and 1977, later returning to read the news on TV-AM in the 1980s.
