Hilary Duff has a number of handlers,including her manager mother, and they are making the producers of “Younger” crazy, a well-placed insider tells Confidenti@l.\n“Hilary is a gem, it’s her people who are driving everyone insane,” laughs our source.\nThe main issue, we’re told, is that Duff, who plays a twentysomething office assistant named Kelsey Peters on the TV Land series, doesn’t want to dress like her character would be budgeted to.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR IOS\n“How much do you think an assistant makes anywhere in New York City? Her people have been requesting designer clothing, shoes and handbags for her role, complaining that the actual star of the show, Sutton Foster, looks better and her clothing is cuter,” the insider said.\nProducers have also had to field an influx of calls from Duff’s momager — before the show even started filming — with requests for them to “cast a wide net” in finding her a pro who would be talented enough to style the actress’ hair.\nDuff’s camp also requests she that she gets to fly home to Los Angeles even when she only gets a few days off, instead of staying in New York where the show is filmed.\nMeanwhile, Debi Mazar, who plays Foster’s best friend and confidant on the show, is low-maintenance and does her own makeup. Our source says Mazar, one of Madonna’s best friends, likes to regale the crew with tales of her wild days with the pop superstar.\n“Debi actually toured with Madonna. She says things like ‘so I was taaawking to my friend Mado and . . .’ in that (thick New York) accent of hers,” says our source. “She’ll have fun saying, ‘Ugh, all my fans are outside of the trailer right now and paparazzi wanting to take my pickcha, it’s so annoying,’ knowing they are there for Hilary.”\nJust four episodes into the first season of “Younger,” TV Land renewed it for a second season and ordered 12 episodes. It launched on TV Land and Nick at Nite and Nick Jr. simultaneously, and the premiere episode drew 1.4 million viewers.\nRelated Stories Happy 28th birthday Hilary Duff!
