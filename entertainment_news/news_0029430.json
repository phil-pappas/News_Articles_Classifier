A new website created by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer ( schumer.senate.gov/wirelessdeadzone ), lets people rate cellphone service in dead zones on a scale from one to five.\nSchumer is promising to compare the actual experience of cellphone users with coverage maps published by carriers such as Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint to check their accuracy.\n“We hope and expect that this cache of data will provide ample evidence to compel the FCC to look into the coverage maps,’’ Schumer said. “And if the coverage maps are held under tighter scrutiny, wireless carriers will have to improve their service if they want to advertise. So that’s probably the biggest benefit of all. If they are forced to have good maps, they may be forced to improve their service.’’\nSchumer told reporters Wednesday that he’s experienced dead zones repeatedly in three parts of the Hudson Valley — Westchester, Dutchess and Sullivan counties — “but it’s from one end of the state to the other.’’\nVerizon Wireless, the nation’s largest cellphone carrier, defended its maps.\n“Verizon Wireless has always worked to ensure accuracy and transparency in communicating wireless coverage and limitations,’’ spokesman Andrew Testa said in an email.\nSchumer said his office will collect complaints until 6 p.m. Nov. 11 and then submit the information to the Federal Communications Commission.\nBTUMULTY@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:06:18.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
