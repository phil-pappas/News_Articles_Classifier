Was she jittery about the facing the camera for the film after a break? “Today I’m saying it with experience… once an artiste, always an artiste,” Aishwarya told IANS here. “People take a vacation, people take breaks… we are actors, who make one film in two years, and we are asked ‘You are doing a film after so long, how do you feel’…there are actors who do a film once in two years…so this also happens,” she added. Aishwarya, who was last seen on the big screen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s directorial “Guzaarish”, will be seen essaying the role of a lawyer threatened to fight the case of a criminal in “Jazbaa”. Given that she took a break from films to attend to her daughter Aaradhya, Aishwarya said she could relate to the role better after being a mother . “I would’ve chosen this script even five years ago…but the difference between then and today is that today I am a mother…so the way I would’ve played this part five years ago would have been acting in a different way. whereas today I am a parent, a mother . “So, when I played Anuradha Varma (the character), I do know what a mother is experiencing,” Aishwarya said. “Jazbaa” which is a Hindi remake of South Korean movie “Seven Days”, is produced by Essel Vision, White Feather Films and Viking Entertainment.
