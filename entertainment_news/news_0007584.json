But who knew that binge-watching \"Law & Order\" could actually make you a better person ? \nIt sounds almost unbelievable but researchers from Washington State University recently completed a study that showed that college freshman who watched \"Law & Order\" were likely to show \"decreased rape myth acceptance and increased intentions to adhere to expressions of sexual consent and refuse unwanted sexual activity.\" \nTranslation? College freshman who watch \"Law & Order\" are more likely to make sure they have consent before they have sex, are more likely to refuse sex if they don't want to participate, and are less likely to believe dangerous rape myths like \"she was asking for it by wearing a short skirt\" or that date rape isn't really rape. \nHoly Olivia Benson, that is great news! \nMore from The Stir : 10 Troublesome Trends on College Campuses \nSexual assault on college campuses is a major issue. Colleges and universities are now being mandated to do more to prevent sexual violance and it is interesting to think sponsering \"Law & Order\" binge watches in the dorms might actually be a realistic way to make sure college students develop good values and behaviors related to sexual assault. \nThe study also looked at what happens when freshman volunteers watched \"NCSI\" and \"CSI\" but only found that it was good old \"Law & Order\" that seemed to promote these positive changes to student attitudes. This is most likely to due to the fact that \"Law & Order\" dealt more explicitly with sex crimes and the impact of crime on victims. \nThat and they have Ice-T. You can't ignore Ice-T. \n\nImage via Janet Mayer / Splash News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:52:11.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
