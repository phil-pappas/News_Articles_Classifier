Dear Outsider: I think you should continue being true to the person you really are. If you’re feeling isolated now, consider what a fraud you will feel like if you join a religion and must pray to a deity you don’t believe in in order to “fit in.” While many churches promote church-related youth activities, you should explore what nonsectarian activities are available in your community. (Is that creepy or is it me?) Abby, we have nothing to hide, but our life is none of her business . Continue to be polite to your neighbor, but when she asks questions you would rather not answer, instead of answering her directly, respond with another question: “Myrtle, why do you ask?” If she presses for an answer, without being confrontational say, “It’s personal,” and change the subject. Be sure to keep your shades drawn on windows that face her house, and when you walk your dog, take a different route.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:32:09.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
