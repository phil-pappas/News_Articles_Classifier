He was just plain awful. He spent the pilot taunting George, terrorizing nurses, and almost killing a patient. (I guess that last part's understandable, since it was only his first day — but still.) What bothered me most was the fact that he was ever even assigned to Dr. Bailey's service: In the pilot, only Izzie, George, Cristina, and Meredith were her interns. What was the point of transferring Alex to Dr. Bailey too? Did the network not think that three powerhouse women and one brilliant but bumbling boy next door were enough? Did we seriously (to use the frequently overused catchphrase of the show's early seasons) need to add a white bad boy into the mix?\n What followed for Alex (played by Justin Chambers) was a veritable parade of douchebaggery. He started a syphilis outbreak. (Not hating on his casual sex game, but he's a doctor — he should know to use condoms.) He yelled at patients and treated women (actually, everyone) like they were beneath him. He somehow managed to both sexually harass and reject Addison Montgomery Shepherd. And he entered into a codependent relationship with Jane Doe/Ava that nearly destroyed both of them. There were flashes of compassion throughout — I'll admit I got choked up when he picked up Izzie and carried her away from Denny Dukette's death bed — and it was clear viewers were supposed to see him as a jerk with a heart of gold, in part because we were supplied with plenty of explanations for his behavior. He had an abusive father, a mentally ill mother, and a youth spent in foster care and juvie. But all those explanations were just that: explanations. They weren't excuses.\nMore From Cosmopolitan And yet now here we are, in a world where Alex is responsible enough to be Meredith's emergency contact. In a world where he's in a loving, honest relationship with Jo, someone with whom he's finally allowed himself to be vulnerable. In a world where, if my suspicious/fantasies are correct, he's going to be a committed father before the season is up. How did Grey' s pull this off?\nI can pinpoint the exact episode where things started to shift; actually, I can pinpoint the exact sentence . In season five, at Alex's wedding to Izzie, when he was asked if he'd prepared vows, he looked at her and said, \"Today's the day my life begins.\" Let's set aside the facts that (1) he stole that opening line and the whole speech that followed from a college valedictorian car crash victim and (2) he was marrying Izzie under the assumption that she was almost certainly going to die. For me, that moment was about him realizing he was capable of living a life where he was a better, more accountable man. It was him realizing he wanted to live like that.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail ABC From there the change was gradual, if not glacial — which is a good thing. If he'd made that declaration and then turned up as a brand new, happy, functional person at the start of season six, it would've been infuriatingly unrealistic. What's great about Grey's is that it plays a long game in terms of character development (perhaps because it's been on forever — no complaints here). The show is content to let its players change the way real people change: at a (sometimes agonizingly) slow rate, over time. The Old Alex didn't disappear completely. He's still a smartass sometimes. But he's a more confident, less cruel smartass.\nOf course, Jo is a huge part of Alex's transformation — he found an equal in her, a person with a similarly traumatic upbringing who could understand his defense mechanisms but not put up with them. And yet, she's not the sole explanation for his change. He wasn't the bad boy magically and instantly \"fixed\" by a romantic relationship — Grey's knows that's not how life really works. If anything, the women in Alex's life with whom he has platonic relationships — namely his \"person,\" Meredith, and his mentor, Arizona — are the ones who have inspired his evolution most.\nAlex and Meredith aren't sticking together because they have \"feelings\" for each other, nor are they friends out of some empty \"hey, we're the last Dr. Bailey interns standing\" solidarity. They're a chosen, sometimes dysfunctional family. When Meredith disappeared after Derek's death, Alex worried about her incessantly and called her repeatedly. And when she gave birth to Ellis, he dropped everything to be with her after the hospital called him — again, as her emergency contact.\nAs for Arizona's impact: Well, she encouraged him to work with the kids and babies, and he's become kinder and more determined to be the sort of man they can look up to as a result. Plus, we get to see him holding tiny humans on the regular. In short: McDreamy who?\n​Follow Lauren on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x2272/gallery-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x681/gallery-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x909/gallery-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x1090/gallery-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSzl_h5KVSE", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x1818/gallery-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg", "https://twitter.com/L_Hoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x1392/gallery-1444327269-gettyimages-93367469.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:23:12.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
