The County also knows how to put on one incredible tasting tour. Tour attendees traveled to a variety of stops on Saturday and Sunday to take part in the 18th Annual Wayne County Apple Tasting Tour Weekend. Offering almost every type of apple you can think of, plus vineyards, corn mazes, petting zoos, homemade goods, cider-inspired treats and more, there really was something for everyone to enjoy. Wayne County hosts the Apple Tasting Tour every October, partnering with local farms, farm markets and wineries. The tour is advertised as a challenge, with interested parties attempting to visit each stop on the “tour” throughout the month. This year’s tour features twelve venues and includes places such as Burnap’s Farm Market & Café in Sodus, Thorpe Vineyard in Wolcott, Young Sommer Winery in Williamson, and the Apple Shed in Newark.\nEach stop listed on the tour brochure, available at Appletastingtour.com , offers something unique. For starters, the variety of apples differ from venue to venue in addition to their flavor, color, size, texture and scent. Events, activities, produce, games, raffles and wine testing also vary depending on the location.\nFor Joan Allen, owner of Long Acre Farms, the Apple Tasting Tour is a great way to invite people to explore Wayne County. “People can come and sample fresh New York apples and really see the diversity of the county. Each stop on the tour is different and it's fall in New York, which is just beautiful. Plus, it really tickles your heart to see the generations of families that come out year after year,” she shared.\nIn addition to enjoying apple samples at Long Acre Farm on Sunday, a multitude of children were enjoying the child-sized corn maze (don’t worry, there is also a more challenging maze for adults). “The kiddie maze is awesome for parents who are strapped for time, and it is also interactive so they can learn as they are going through it,” stated Yashy Murphy, a writer from Toronto, Canada, who traveled with her family to explore western New York. “Plus, it only lasts about twenty minutes, rather than an hour or more.”\nFor tour attendees who want to sample other food and drink items, many of the stops offer cider-themed goods such as cider doughnuts, cider slushies, sweet cider and hard cider. Other food items include fresh maple syrup, honey, and award-winning grapes.\nWith fall foliage about to hit peak season, the Apple Tasting Tour provides an incredible way to see stunning scenery plus an opportunity to try some of the areas best apples and other produce. With three more weeks to take the apple tour challenge, there is no better time than the present to gather up the entire family and head over to Wayne County.\nTo learn more about the tour challenge and download a tour “passport,” visit AppleTastingTour.com .\nMZEPPIERI@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:03:52.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
