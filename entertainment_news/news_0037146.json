The comedy show will begin at 7:30 pm with the house opening at 7 pm and is co-sponsored by 1000 Islands Harbor Hotel. Special overnight hotel accommodations are available at the 1000 Islands Harbor Hotel. It is the intent of the Thousand Island Comedy Festival to present a full comedy festival next summer at the Clayton Opera House and this is a preview show for the festival as well as a benefit for the Opera House “which has provided so much great entertainment for the Thousand Islands Region over the years” according to the comedy show’s host and producer Michael Kinnie. Headlining comedian Mick Lazinski has toured with George Carlin and Joan Rivers. Carlin described Mick as, “one of the funniest!@#$% guys in the world, and people should know his !@#$% name.” Rivers added, “I have three things to say about Mick, brilliant, brilliant, and !@#$% brilliant.” When Mick won the “Laugh Across America” competition in Las Vegas comedian Robert Klein was quoted as saying, “I knew Mick was the winner 30 seconds after he stepped on the stage.” Mick’s national television appearances include: Comedy Tonight, Evening at the Improv and Comedy on the Road, which paved the way to appearances on the Late Show and Tim Allen’s Showtime Comedy Club All-Star s. He also appeared on VH-1 Stand-Up Spotlight and had multiple Comic Strip Live and Full Frontal Comedy appearances. He’s been a favorite at the now closed Lake Ontario Playhouse in Sackets Harbor for over a decade. Co-headlining the comedy benefit, MIKE STANKIEWICZ was also a favorite at the Lake Ontario Playhouse and at comedy clubs and colleges across the country. Mike regularly performs on cruise ships and was featured on Comedy Central and A&E’s Comedy on the Road . Mike was also the winner of the prestigious\"Best of Philly\"award presented by Philadelphia Magazine. Mike plies his wares everywhere from Las Vegas to Atlantic City, from Mobile to Montana. He's a modern day Kerouac, according to Mike’s website “you probably passed him \"on the road”! The comedy show will run about ninety minutes and also feature Mike Kinnie as the Master of Ceremonies and possibly an extra special guest comedian or two. Tickets are $15 per person with the proceeds benefiting the Clayton Opera House and the Thousand Islands Comedy Festival.
