The decision, taken yesterday by European Union Chair of the Contact Group of Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), will come into effect from December 1.

In addition, Indian ship-owners are likely to benefit significantly on account of savings on insurance and associated operating costs.

The extension of the eastern limit of the HRA from 65 oE to 78oE led to security concerns on account of the presence of private security personnel onboard merchant vessels transiting the piracy HRA, and the presence of floating armouries off the Indian coast. \nThe shipping industry also incurred additional costs for insurance and implementation of various recommendations for transit through the piracy HRA. In addition to deployment of Indian Naval ships in the Gulf of Aden since October 2008 for anti-piracy patrols, robust action by the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard led to the arrest of 120 pirates from four pirate mother-ships between January-March 2011. \nAffirmative action and increased surveillance contributed towards the decline of piracy incidents in the East Arabian Sea and the last reported piratical activity in the East Arabian Sea was in March, 2012, the statement said. The absence of piracy in the Indian maritime zones and adjacent seas, the security concerns and financial implications of an extended HRA led to India seeking a review of the HRA, with the support of numerous countries \n  11:01 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:47:12.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
