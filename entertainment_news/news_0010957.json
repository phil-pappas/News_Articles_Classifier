According to a newspaper, Sony executives have told the 47-year-old actor to shut up and stop bashing Bond. It is said that there were problems while re-shooting some scenes at the set prior to the release of the film, The Independent reports. A source said that Craig was injured on the set and needed knee surgery, and they were still doing re-shoots last month. Earlier, Daniel Craig, who plays James Bond in 'Spectre,' said that he would rather break a glass and slash his wrists than do another 'Bond' film, adding that all he wanted to do was move on.(ANI) Â»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:29:23.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
