Bryan's incredibly supportive, loving and a brilliant father figure. Sandra says he's perfect.'' \n'Entertainment Tonight' has confirmed that Sandra has recently been seen out and about with a toddler, although she has yet to comment on the adoption reports. \nSandra previously gushed that being a mother makes her feel complete. \nShe said: ''I was putting [Louis] to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in. And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.'''
