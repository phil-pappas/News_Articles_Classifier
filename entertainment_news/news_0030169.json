Brendon was arrested in May, a few months before he arrived in Ireland, for public intoxicatio at a comic-con in South Carolina and before that in March when he was charged with property damage for thrashing a hotel room in Florida.\nThis time around, Brendon's been charged with robbery, obstruction of breathing and criminal mischief. Lt. Bob Jillison of the Saratoga Springs Police Department said that alcohol was involved when Brendon allegedly choked his girlfriend after she tried to return some property to him and told him she intended to leave. It's understood that Brendon then threw her car keys and mobile phone into the street when she tried to call for help.\nBrendon was released from jail on a $20,000 bond last night and made no comment through his lawyer or Facebook.\nVia THR\nMORE: Robin Williams' daughter posted a beautiful message about dealing with depression on Instagram\nMORE: Antonio Banderas is going to fashion school so he can make men's capes a thing again\nMORE: Watch: Amy Schumer talks being drunk & eating Jake Gyllenhaal's cake with Stephen Colbert", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/buffy-star-nicholas-brendon-arrested-828792"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:06:34.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
