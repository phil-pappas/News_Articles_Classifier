New moons are always a time for beginnings and important decisions, but this one — presaging fall frolics — packs a special wallop.\nARIES (March 20-April 18)  No, Ari! No, that person does not \"just want to be friends.\" You Rams are nothing if not impulsive and that's especially true where emotions are involved. Now, with the sun and new moon dancing in your one-on-one house, be certain to say what you mean and mean what you say.\nTAURUS (April 19-May 19)  Monday's sun/moon meld impacts the nitty-gritty of your life in ways hard to imagine. Cosmic biggies have you in their sight  What's on the line? \"Just\" those daily components that make things work or not work. Like the \"little\" people who can empower you. Or not.\nGEMINI (May 20-June 20)  The sun shines, the moon waxes, each setting off your sensuality sensor. You want to romp and play, form amorous attachments or make existing ones livelier. Easy does it; this is a time when babies can get started. If that's not part of your game plan, be aware that creativity comes in many flavors.\nRelated Stories Minerva's Sunday Horoscope: 10/11/15 Horoscope for Saturday, 10/10/15 by Christopher Renstrom Horoscope for Friday, 10/9/15 by Christopher Renstrom Horoscope for Thursday, 10/8/15 by Christopher Renstrom Horoscope for Wednesday, 10/7/15 by Christopher Renstrom CANCER (June 21-July 21)  This year's theme continues to embrace both work-a-day issues and lofty ambitions.

Begin your regimen on Monday.\nLEO (July 22-Aug. 22)  Monday's sun-moon combo opens a window of opportunity centered around personal communications. You could invent a new computer or at least a new program. Consider the P.R. potential of a trailblazing blog. Whatever path you choose, your legendary communication skills will be showcased.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)  As lucky Jupiter continues to launch his magic thunderbolts from your sign, you feel increasingly psychic. Make a decision Monday regarding your bank account, then act on it. Happily, the help you may seek comes through someone close — possibly as close as the next pillow.\nLIBRA (Sept. 22-Oct. 22)  The mysterious moon and sizzling sun spark a moment of truth as they appear for their annual meet up in your sign.

Use it wisely.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)  Even the most-evolved Scorpio requires a reality check once in awhile.

Think: Wishes are horses and Archers will ride.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 21-Jan. 18)  Much of 2015 has been about passing \"Go.\" Come Monday, you pull the \"Get out of jail free\" card. Now at last you get a breather. A psychic type like you doesn't need a gypsy. You already know your future involves chairing a Boardwalk Plaza conglomerate.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 19-Feb. 17)  The pressure's been building for a long time. You crave adventure and will find it one way or another. Is a decision in order? Look for Monday's new moon to throw light on the situation. Just make certain that you and your bank balance are on the same page.\nPISCES (Feb. 18-March 19)  Does anyone really understand how hard you struggle to keep Humpty Dumpty together? Happily, Monday's sun-moon rendezvous heralds a solution to a joint funds issue. It's called good karma. Make the right decision Monday and the whole year will fall into place.\nMinerva's Mailbag \nQuestion: Now that my karmic Saturn return has left Scorpio, what fate awaits with Saturn in Sagittarius? I was born June 15, 1956.\nAnswer: Saturn returns are biggies. With the first (which happens when one is between 27 and 31), a person leaves youth behind and enters adulthood. With the second — 30 years later — it's about maturity. Undoubtedly you've learned lots from experiencing delays and frustrations. The good part is that you get to keep all that moxie. It's not a flash-in-the-pan Jupiter kind of thing.\n\nNext on the agenda is Saturn's residence in your one-on-one house. Partnerships of all kinds will come up for re-examinations. This can be a positive thing. Significant decisions will be made. Things that you've worked hard for will finally come through.
