Benghazi Committee Chairman and Tea Party member Trey Gowdy is known for being a no-nonsense kind of man — but now he’s being likened on social media to a variety of scary movie characters.\nThe South Carolina congressman is already known for not holding back his thoughts. He told Hillary Clinton last weekend that she was “ not worth 18 months ” of his life when responding to critics who claimed his investigation into the Benghazi attacks was a political effort to go after the former Secretary of State.\nTHE MANY FACES OF HILLARY CLINTON DURING BENGHAZI HEARING\nBut now social media users are poking fun at him, and comparing his likeness to famous characters in popular films.\nHere is a list of five characters who resemble the politician:\nLord Voldemort of the “Harry Potter” movies\nJ.

Pictures, Jaap Buitendijk) Enlarge Gowdy and \"Harry Potter\" character Draco Malfoy could be long-lost brothers.\nGowdy’s slick, flaxen hair seems to be modeled after another “Harry Potter” bad boy — pure-blood wizard Draco Malfoy.\nSome believe that Gowdy and Malfoy may have been separated at birth, with both sporting looks of regret on their faces.\nSilas of “The DaVinci Code”\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images Silas from the movie, \"The DaVinci Code,\" and Gowdy seem to exude a certain sense of pain.

Enlarge HO/REUTERS Actor Michael Douglas is shown in his role as Gordon Gekko from the 1987 Oliver Stone film \"Wall Street\" in this publicity photo released to Reuters September 15, 2009. Twenty-two years after appearing on the big screen, and one year after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers, the film character Gordon Gekko continues to resonate on Wall Street. The \"strip and flip\" corporate raider played by Michael Douglas will make his comeback in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street 2,\" which began filming in New York this week. The sequel is set in 2008 during the run-up to the financial meltdown with Gekko emerging from two decades behind bars. To match feature LEHMAN/GEKKO.
