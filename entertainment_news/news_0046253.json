City officials are discussing long-term plans to replace aging water and power lines and upgrade Riverside Public Utilities' technology. , PETER SUROWSKI, FILE PHOTO Related article » IF YOU GO What: Riverside City Council will discuss a proposed long-term plan to upgrade and modernize the city's water and electric utilities.\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 6.\nWhere: Council chambers at Riverside City Hall, 3900 Main St.\nInformation: The meeting agenda and a report are at: www.riversideca.gov .\nReplacing old power lines and water pipes and modernizing Riverside’s public utilities with high-tech meters and other technology could cost up to $1 billion over the next decade.\nUtility officials have not yet discussed how such improvements would be financed, but they’ll ask the City Council to approve the conceptual long-term plan for the utilities’ future on Tuesday, Oct. 6.\nThe plan would speed up the replacement schedule for aging electric and water infrastructure, convert city streetlights to energy-saving LED bulbs, create facilities to capture and reuse more recycled water, and expand the city’s fiber optic network.\nIt would also create a road map for the utilities’ work force, including revamped job descriptions, improved recruitment and better training.\nThe Riverside Public Utilities board approved the plan Friday, Oct. 2. It is projected to cost between $500 million and $1 billion overall, but specific projects and spending would be discussed and voted on at future meetings. Officials plan to review utility expenses and discuss any proposed rate changes in 2016.\nA key element of the plan is to accelerate how quickly water mains and electric poles, wires and transformers are replaced. Water pipelines are expected to last 70 years, but the city’s current replacement schedule is 130 years, Riverside Public Utilities General Manager Girish Balachandran said.\nRIVERSIDE: Repair to leaky pipeline restores downtown water pressure\nIn July, some customers lost water pressure when a 79-year-old water main at Mission Inn and Park avenues ruptured.\n“Right now we’re not replacing our infrastructure at a sustainable rate,” Balachandran said. “We have a gap today and the gap widens every year.”\nThe 10-year plan would shorten the replacement cycle to 100 years for water infrastructure.\nThe city began upgrading customers’ electric meters around 2010, but utility workers still have to drive around the city to read them. Riverside is “about 10 years behind the rest of the industry,” Balachandran said. Long-term plans include meters that send information every 15 minutes instead of once a month and can notify the utility about outages.\nThe long-term plan would be funded from some combination of spending reserves, selling assets such as utility-owned land or water that’s not needed for Riverside customers, borrowing, cutting other costs and raising customer rates, which Balachandran called “the last resort.”\nUtility board member Andrew Walcker called the plan “forward-thinking” at Friday’s meeting, but city critic Vivian Moreno questioned how much ratepayers would be charged to pay for it.\n“We have a lot of people that are having trouble (paying their utility bills) even now when we’re conserving,” she told the board.\nBalachandran said the plan will take years to put into place. The utility’s policy on reserve funds, which Moreno and other critics have questioned, will be discussed beginning in December, and a study of utility costs will start in April.\nUtility officials will present various aspects of the long-term plans and related financial issues to the community over the next year, with a new rate plan potentially taking effect in 2017.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9461 or arobinson@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvrtmt-b88529278z.120151005163525000g1bcdhmi.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvrtmt-b88529278z.120151005163525000g1bcdhmi.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:16:18.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
