I couldn’t have asked for a better kick-start for my trip, literally felt like living life on the edge. I definitely recommend my brother Akshay (Kumar) to do this.” \nAccording to the sources, when Sidharth told his friends he is going to New Zealand; the first thing that they told him was to ensure he does as many adventure activities as possible. This is when the young ‘Student of the Year’ actor decided that he will begin his trip with an adventure. \nAs soon as he had his safety gear in place, Sidharth stepped on the narrow path-way only to realise that this is the best way to kick-start his New Zealand adventure. He had a bird eye’s view of Auckland, its hills, the harbour and the islands beyond. \nThe 30-year-old actor was last spotted in Karan Malhotra’s ‘Brothers’ along with Akshay and Jacqueline Fernandes. \nSidharth will be next seen in Shakun Batra’s ‘Kapoor and Sons’ along with Alia Bhatt and Fawad Khan in lead role.
