After J. Randy Taraborrelli announced he's releasing an unauthorized biography of Beyonce Knowles , Jonathan told INSIDE EDITION that he was the one who made up the rumors. \"It was all a publicity stunt,\" Jonathan said of the rumors about Jay-Z cheating on his wife Beyonce. Of why Jonathan picked that publicity stunt to promote Rihanna, he said, \"I was desperate at the time because I wanted to have a hit record.\" He also admitted his decision could be considered reckless as it might put Rihanna in danger, \"I agree, we were young and stupid.\" Regarding the infamous elevator fight between Jay-Z and his sister-in-law Solange Knowles at the 2014 Met Gala, Jonathan thought that it wasn't set up. However, he thought the power couple might have exploited it for their \"On The Run\" tour that summer. \"I don't think they set it up, that they're gonna stage a fight but their handlers took advantage of it,\" said the music industry publicist. Jonathan said that he regretted what he did to the people affected by the rumors, especially Beyonce and Rihanna. \"I didn't think it would be this big story. But now, seeing Beyonce on the cover of this book and knowing that people are profiting from speculations and opinions about her really turns my stomach.\" Of what he's going to say to the two singers, he said, \"I'd say I'm sorry.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:04:57.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
