At its new location, Galatoire’s Bistro has thrived in large part thanks to its consistency and fabulous food from Chef Kelley McCann. \nThis month, the restaurant will start a new guest chef dinner series. In this week’s One-on-One, I spoke with Galatoire’s Bistro’s new general manager Jason Gilfour about his career and staying alive in the Capital City market. \nWhen did you arrive in Baton Rouge? \nIt was roughly about six months ago. I was intending to move up to the Baton Rouge market. I looked at all the establishments. I was more familiar with some than others. \nWhere had you been working? \nI was working for Motivated Seafood, a seafood manufacturing facility down in Houma. I relocated there after Hurricane Katrina. I had been in New Orleans for 12 years before Katrina. I was fortunate that I had a home to go to. \nThe first time we met, you had mentioned you had humble beginnings in the food industry. Tell me about that. \nYeah, I started working for a mom and pop restaurant in Thibodeaux — the Shore Line Restaurant, a seafood restaurant. It was semi-fine dining. I was there at a young age. I was fortunate to have the position. The guy paid me cash until I was old enough to get a paycheck. That’s 30 years ago. I’m 42 now. I worked my way through school and college in the restaurant industry and worked my way into a management position. I’ve been in the food industry from one angle or another ever since. \nSo you missed the restaurant atmosphere? \nYeah, you could say that. I missed the pace of it. The industry has grown by leaps and bounds. The wonderful thing is that the restaurant industry is a community. We know one another, but at the end of the day, we’re competing. It’s about outperforming each other day-to-day. It was an easy transition. \nWhat has been your goal as general manager of Galatoire’s Bistro? \nReally, I’ve been allying myself with [owner] Melvin [Rodrigue] and the Galatoire’s concept, the direction they’re going in. It felt like a good fit for me from the start. It’s really about the staff, too. I’m looking to facilitate the talents and skills of the people who are already in place. They’ve been teaching me about the history and culture of the restaurant along the way. The focus is consistent quality. That can be a challenge day in, day out. It’s about keeping a mindset and awareness, the attention to detail, so there is consistent quality. \nBeing in the city for 10 years, what does that mean for the restaurant? \nWe feel that milestone. We want to be engaged in the community here. We see social groups and outings and those working with a charity to help produce funds for some cause or another. We want to be engaged in those things. Our longevity has opened us up to lots of folks that approach us on a regular basis.
