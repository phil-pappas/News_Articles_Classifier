Respect the grounds',\" O'Brien said. \"They were very strict about littering and don't take any artifacts like rocks, skulls ... anything like that. And everyone just takes stuff, you know, obviously.\" \nO'Brien, 24, didn't say what was taken, but he said later illnesses were blamed on the artifacts that were removed from the ranch. O'Brien said he also got sick, but it was unclear if he also admitted stealing any items. \nA representative for O'Brien did not immediately return an email from the AP. \nNew Mexico Film Office director Nick Maniatis said his agency would work with 20th Century Fox on the investigation. \n\"If artifacts were taken, we believe they should be returned immediately. Twentieth Century Fox has been extremely cooperative and shares the Film Office's concern and sensitivity toward the matter,\" Maniatis said. \nDiamond Tail Ranch, which sits between the Sandia and San Felipe pueblos, is near the historic Hispanic village of Placitas and an abandoned mining community. Jeep tours of the area bring tourists to the mountainous region where artifacts and petroglyphs can be spotted up close. \nHart said the ranch had been open for filming but had imposed strict rules. \n\"We charge $10 per cigarette butt,\" Hart said. \"And if cast members were caught stealing anything, they were kicked off the property. We didn't care if you were in the film or not.\" \nHart said 20th Century Fox officials told the ranch they want to find out if items were actually stolen or if O'Brien was embellishing a tale during his \"Live with Kelly and Michael\" appearance. \nMaxine McBrinn, curator of Archaeology for the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture in Santa Fe, said it's illegal to take American Indian artifacts from public land, but not private land. \n\"Regardless, it's disrespectful,\" McBrinn said. \"When you remove an item, you destroy the archaeological information in the contexts it provides. You have done damage to the information.\" \nFollow Russell Contreras on Twitter at http://twitter.com/russcontreras . \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:34:41.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
