We got lots of photos of local houses totally tricked out for trick-or-treater. Open graves, hellhounds, even a huge illuminated spider web were spied. Creeptastic! \nTake a look at the photos in the gallery above to see some of our favorites. If you've got photos of Halloween decor guaranteed to send shivers down our spine, post them in comments or tweet them @njdotcom with #JerseyWeen. Make sure to include the location where the picture was taken so people can see your ghoulish creation in the flesh. \nJohn Shabe can be reach at jshabe@njadvancemedia.com .
