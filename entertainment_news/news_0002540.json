We have created a trompe l’oeil, a three-dimensional illusion that plays on the eye and makes visitors think they have stepped onto the flying carpet, which then weaves its way over Kidderminster.

Our fantastic three-dimensional carpet allows people to really look at some of the most important designs that have originated from the town and were used to carpet palaces and embassies all over the world.” For more information on events in and around Kidderminster click here .

Be the first to comment \nMuseum staff have worked with Birmingham-based Street Advertising Services to create the illusion. \nMeanwhile, the Museum wants people to ‘tweet their feet’ as they are on the carpet and join a gallery of images that will appear on its website. The exhibition will run until December 31. Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
