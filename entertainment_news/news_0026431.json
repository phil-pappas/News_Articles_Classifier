When Larson, 26, gets an Oscar nomination for her performance in the movie Room, people may well be surprised to recognize the actress from Trainwreck, Short Term 12, Don Jon, The Gambler or The Spectacular Now. Maybe you saw Larson in 21 Jump Street or Rampart, or on TV's United States of Tara. \nWhat you remember are the characters she portrays. \nLarson stars in Room as Ma, a young mother who has been held captive for several years and whose son was fathered by her abductor. Ma, now 24, and her child Jack, five, live by themselves in a small garden shed. They have no contact with the outside world except visits from the kidnapper; as they can never leave, Ma has created a whole world for Jack in their tiny space. The film, which is based on Emma Donoghue's bestselling novel, is a thriller as well as an homage to maternal love and the power of the imagination. \nThe awards buzz started for Room even before the movie played at TIFF and won the People's Choice Award, considered an important Oscar predictor. (Previous winners include The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire and 12 Years a Slave, all Academy Award winners.) \nLarson, who was at TIFF last month to promote Room, is pleased by all the Oscar talk but sees it as the icing on a pretty terrific cake. \n\"The movie has already meant so much to me,\" she says. \"I knew it had the potential to have great, magical, powerful abilities, but it's like capturing lightning in a bottle — there's a big difference between filming something and having it transcend the screen. It's very rare that that actually happens, and so, to be part of a film that does that, and is really connecting people to themselves, to something very deep inside of them — that's when film is at its absolute best.\" \nLarson says the creative process is what she's after, a passion that led her to acting while she was still a child. She started at age seven. \"It became a playground for me to be able to express all these things that were confusing to me, or things I wanted to know more about, to try on different people, different ways of doing things.\" \nSurprisingly, Larson says she was very shy growing up. \"So I'm not sure why I pushed my mom to get me acting lessons, but I'm so grateful for it, because I can see myself in an alternate reality as this kind of recluse, who just writes all day and never sees the light of day.\" She laughs. \nLarson is also a singer/songwriter. She released an album in 2005 (Finally Out of P.E.); more recently, she sang with the band Metric in the 2010 movie, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. \n\"But I don't think I could have got that far, or been anything public, if I hadn't, at a young age, been put in a situation where I'd get on a stage and do monologues,\" she says. \"And eye contact was always very difficult for me, so being in a situation where 80% of my job is eye contact and reading someone's pupil — I mean, I know how Mark Wahlberg's pupil dilates! Like, you get very close with people and you see the way things are expressed. I don't think I could have been comfortable with all that had I not been doing this career.\" \nUnlike some of her peers, Larson managed to get through adolescence without having any growing pains in public. Home-schooled, the actress describes her teen self as straight-laced and not particularly interested in the scene. \n\"I love art, and philosophy and folklore, and I believe in the medium,\" she says, \"and I believe in living my own life and having a very colourful, interesting experience, for the sake of knowing all the colours and all the different ways life can be, so I can bring truth back into cinema.\" \nShe continues, \"The work I do, and what makes me feel comfortable as an actor, is seeing it as an act of service. It's not about me, it's not about my face, it's not about furthering my personal gain. It's about creating a magical experience, so audience members can go through a journey and I can help participate in what that journey is, and what they feel, and what conclusions they get to at the end of it.\" \nRoom opens in Toronto this Friday. It will expand to other cities throughout the fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:13:37.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
