He is the first Metra officer to be killed in the line of duty.\nThe jury began deliberating at 4 p.m. Cook's wife, Pam, and their two children, Jessica and Jimmy, were at the courthouse in Markham Tuesday for closing arguments.\nProsecutors argued that Nicholson and another man were planning to rob people on the night of Cook's death.\nA key witness for the state was that other man, Jeremy Lloyd, who testified as part of a plea agreement that he was looking to commit armed robberies with Nicholson when they came upon Cook's marked car.\nLloyd said he watched as Nicholson raised a gun toward the open driver's side window of Cook's car and heard two shots as he turned away and fled.\nThere was no physical evidence linking Nicholson to the killing, but prosecutors told the jury that testimony and circumstantial evidence — linking Nicholson to a string of crimes leading up to Cook's slaying, including the attempted murder of a Harvey officer — is enough to convict.\nThe defense emphasized the lack of physical evidence against Nicholson and said the stories that supposed eyewitnesses gave over the years changed or that they flat-out lied.\nNicholson is serving consecutive sentences at Stateville Correctional Center on charges that include attempted murder. He won't be eligible for parole until 2145.\nOfficers filled Circuit Court Judge Frank Zelezinski's courtroom Tuesday morning for the trial that, as one witness from the Illinois State Police crime lab testified during the trial, involved \"one of their own.\"\nNick Swedberg is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright © 2015, Daily Southtown Homicide Crime Trials and Arbitration", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dacc8/turbine/ct-sta-metra-cop-murder-trial-st-1014-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:47:47.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
