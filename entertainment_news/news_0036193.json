Dumaplin\nOctober 23, 2015 Mark Reyes\nAvid viewers of the GMA-7 series “The Half Sisters” have reason to rejoice – the show has been extended until January next year.\nDirector Mark Reyes attributes their success to one thing: “Ang gagaling ng mga artista ko, that’s it.”\nHe said stars Barbie Forteza, Thea Tolentino, Andre Paras, and Ruru Madrid have improved vastly as actors.\n“I don’t even have to tell them where their characters are coming from, because they know it so well. Sometimes pa nga, they’re the ones who point out na ‘Direk, ’di ba dati ganyan, so dapat hindi dapat ganu’n na…’ Sabi ko, ‘Oo nga, you’re right,’ parang ganu’n,” he related.\nMark particularly likes it that they now find it easy to cry on cue.\n“Kaya nga ‘festival of tears’ ang tawag ko dito sa show na ’to eh,” he quipped.\nHe also recognized the excellence of the show’s supporting cast including Gloria Romero, Gina Pareño, Eula Valdez, Eddie Garcia, Jean Garcia and Cherie Gil.\n“We are lucky to have them on the show. Sabi ko nga before, ‘We have the real deal here,’” Mark said.\nHe admitted that he initially didn’t believe “The Half Sisters” will hit its stride as quickly as it did. “It’s weird because, usually, (for a series) it’s either slow burn ’yan before you get the traction. But here, from day one, we had traction eh. I don’t know what’s with the show,” he said.\n“Sabi ko nga, if we reach three months, we’ll be thankful, if we hit four months, all the more na we’ve done our jobs right kasi umabot tayo ng four months… Aba, pagdating ng fourth month, nagdere-deretso na,” he added.\nMark is proud of the show’s excellent storyline.\n“That’s our rule of thumb, the minute that you don’t have a story to tell, stop. That is the mandate,” said he.\nMark describes the next arc in the story of “The Half Sisters” as “kind of edgy,” and “controversial.” He related needing to get approval as “it is a bit sexual, it could be too mature for their (lead actors’) age.”\nHe explained, “S’yempre we’re not only concerned about the success of the show, we are concerned about the future of our artists… You know naman sometimes ang mga tao, hindi nila mahiwalay ’yung fact from fiction so, let’s see.”\n“The Half Sisters” airs weekdays afternoon on GMA-7.
