No? And yet this is exactly what is happening in our country.\nA country is only as good as its leaders; and the leaders are only as good as the voters who elected them to power – which says a lot about the people in this godforsaken country of ours.\nAsk yourself: While all the grandstanding, shenanigans, and tomfoolery is going on in parliament, who is running the country?\nI’ll tell you: No one!\nEvery single “leader” in the ANC, when held up to the light, has a closet full of skeletons. And yet the mindless masses are quite content to let these shady characters pilot our ship.\nThis is the ship on which we are sailing. A ship called the SAS Republic of South Africa – dead on course for destruction and chaos.\nHelmless, pilotless, navigatorless, rudderless, leaderless. Hopeless. With the mindless masses aboard as passengers.\nLet’s be quite clear: I despise Zuma and everything he stands for. But, make no mistake; Zuma and his cronies are only in power because the majority of people voted for the despicable, corrupt, rudderless, power hungry ANC.\nNever, in the history of this country, have we seen the mindless masses in a constant state of turmoil – rioting, striking, and protesting against the very government they have voted into power.\nWhy do I refer to them as “mindless?”\nWell, what else would you call people who vote for corrupt, incompetent, uncaring, politicians? With “leaders” who know nothing about “leading.” And a “government” who knows nothing about “governing.”\nAnd an embarrassment who knows nothing about being a president.\nTruly, our ship is bound for destruction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:28:24.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
