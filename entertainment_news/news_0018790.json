(Photo by Paul A. Hebert/Invision/AP, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press LOS ANGELES â€” \nTestimony has concluded in a copyright infringement case against rapper Jay Z over his 1999 hit \"Big Pimpin'.\" \nLawyers for the rap superstar played deposition testimony Tuesday from a former lawyer for the heir of an Egyptian composer who wrote flute notes included in the song. He was the trial's final witness. \nThe notes are from a 1957 love ballad written by composer Baligh Hamdi and appear throughout \"Big Pimpin',\" which was Jay Z's first major hit. Producer Timbaland paid $100,000 in 2001 to settle a claim about its usage. \nLawyers for Hamdi's nephew, Osama Ahmed Fahmy, contend that Jay Z and Timbaland do not have a valid right to use the song. \nClosing arguments are tentatively scheduled to begin Wednesday but the judge must settle several issues first.
