Conservatives had objected , citing church doctrine, but they couldn't muster the votes needed to block passage of the final document.\nWith the badly divided church hierarchy before him in St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday, Francis took veiled aim at those in the church who place more importance on doctrine and law than on God's mercy and forgiveness.\nPlay Video CBSN Vatican, doctors deny reports pope has cancer The Vatican is denying reports the pope has been diagnosed with cancer. The doctor who allegedly treated the pontiff also says it's not true. CBS...\nHe warned them of the risk of \"becoming habitually unmoved by grace,\" of turning a cold shoulder to God's most wounded children and of a \"spiritual illusion\" that doesn't let them see the reality of their flock before them and respond to it.\n\"A faith that does not know how to root itself in the life of people remains arid and, rather than oases, creates other deserts,\" he said, adding that moments of suffering and conflict are precisely the occasions for God to show mercy.\n\"Today is a time of mercy!\"\nWithout changing church doctrine, the 275 synod \"fathers\" on Saturday approved a 94-point final document on responding better to the needs of today's Catholic families. The text covered a host of issues - migration, poverty, single parents and polygamy - but the most disputed section of the document concerned whether civilly remarried Catholics can receive Communion.\nChurch teaching holds that without an annulment, these Catholics are essentially committing adultury and cannot receive Communion.\n90 Photos Pope Francis in America Pope Francis visits Washington, New York and Philadelphia\nWhile the document doesn't chart any specific path to receiving the sacraments as originally sought by liberal prelates - and doesn't even mention the word Communion - it opens the door to case-by-case exceptions by citing the role of discernment and individual conscience in spiritual direction.\nThe key paragraph 85 says a case-by-case approach is necessary when dealing with remarriage since not everyone bears the same responsibility for the preceding divorce. It passed with only one vote more than the two-thirds majority necessary.\nIts passage will give Francis the room to maneuver that he needs if he wants to push the issue further in a future document of his own. German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, who spearheaded the German theological initiative that was decisive to getting the majority, said he hoped that Francis would issue it during his upcoming Jubilee Year of Mercy, which starts Dec. 8.\nSpeaking to thousands of people in St. Peter's Square after Mass Sunday, Francis recalled that the word \"synod\" means to \"walk together\" - a key concept for the pope, who has called for the church to walk with the faithful and accompany them through life's ups and downs.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/25/5bef0636-2520-4161-a8e1-ae194f8796ed/thumbnail/220x140/a30c8498dc9b05a06a5d57bda02533b9/2015-09-23t202406z1277946087gf10000217560rtrmadp3-pope-usa.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/22/ab30da70-d9e1-45a9-9d3f-00f92dc6fa29/thumbnail/220x140/dcc301b1ed82a6d581220521c6490c53/cbsn1021poperumor458917640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:22:42.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
