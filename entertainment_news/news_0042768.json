To me, it's all about brand and a good platform. Branding defines the authenticity and trust any product upholds, so it's of utmost importance to me and it should be for any business entity. \n\"Personally, for my industry, it starts with outlook then delivery, that's why I take my dressing and presentation seriously. I'm not moving from Joy FM, no matter the juicy amount presented to me, because what I have here offers me a good platform and fits my brand. It gives me exactly what I need right now,\" Lexis Bill told Showbiz in an interview. \nHe is just not ready to jump to the highest bidder, particularly at a time when loyalty is becoming a rare commodity among top radio presenters who are continuously being pursued by big money and poached by competitors. For him, Joy FM is the “perfect platform” to build his brand and allow him to live his dreams. \n“Joy FM is the hallmark of excellence. It epitomises what we call real radio experience or professional radio. Everybody will attest to the fact that for over 20 years, the station has held its own and has carved a niche for itself as paving the way for many other radio stations.” \nAccording to him, he had no plan of entering the media and he almost appeared destined for medicine, as was the wish of his father who wanted his son to become a medical practitioner. \nBut while in his first year at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), his love for poetry took him to a campus radio station to request for a poem he heard them reading. His rich voice gave him away and the following day he was put on air. \nIt was the beginning of an inspiring journey from campus to the studios of Joy FM and GHOne where the anchors Men's World Show. He also hosts other social and corporate events. \nAs a business-minded personality, Lexis Bill runs a corporate fitness company, a gym, a media agency for corporate public relations and advertising, a production house and an event-planning company. \nHe holds the strong belief that radio stations must create an environment which allows talents to blossom and also be appreciated. \n\"I think radio station owners should reward and appreciate talent in every possible way. Owners should ensure that their talents have opportunities to upgrade and better themselves. \nIn the same light, presenters should seek further education and upgrade their knowledge. It's the only way they can stay relevant in the business.\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:02:01.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
