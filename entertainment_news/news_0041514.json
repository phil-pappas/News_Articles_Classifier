Joe Camilleri will perform at next year’s 100 Hole Hike. Picture: Valeriu Campan Source: News Corp Australia \nBIG gigs and big hearts will come together to raise money for people with acquired brain injuries in the lead-up to next year’s Hundred Hole Hike. \nMusicians will gather at 13th Beach Golf Course for a series of Friday night concerts titled Music to a Tee. \nThe star-studded line-up includes Jack Howard’s Ambassadors of Love this Saturday, Joe Camilleri’s Black Sorrows on December 4, and ARIA Hall of Fame luminary Renee Geyer on January 8. \nKaringal’s Hundred Hole Hike will conclude the series on Friday, January 22. \nEstablished in 2013, the marathon golf event sees more than 30 amateur and professional golfers tee off at dawn and play 100 holes of golf in one day. \nWithout a buggy, players will walk more than 60km and play an average of 475 shots to raise money for an ABI clubhouse at the Eastern Geelong Community Centre. \nThe clubhouse offers people with an ABI, their carers and family members a place where they can receive peer and social support. \n“In two years, Music to a Tee has raised over $50,000 towards building the ABI clubhouse,” Karingal Foundation executive officer Caroline Moore said. \n“By coming along to one or all of these events, audiences not only get a great night out but also know that their money is going directly towards this wonderful resource for people who live with ABI.” \nFor more details on Music to a Tee, visit karingal.org.au/foundation. Hundred Hole Hike golf bookings are essential.
