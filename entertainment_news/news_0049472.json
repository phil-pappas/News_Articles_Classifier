Los Angeles College of Music (LACM) announces the addition of Ron Sobel as Music Business Department Advisory Chair and David Joyce as Vocal Department Chair. This comes just a few short months after the addition of former Norah Jones' guitarist Adam Levy as Guitar Department Chair.\nRon Sobel will advise and assist in the development of the curriculum for LACM's brand new music business program, which debuts Fall 2015, chaired by Erin Workman . He brings a unique perspective from 16 years as Vice President / Creative Affairs at ASCAP's Los Angeles office and from his work in new media and licensing. During his tenure at ASCAP, Ron was influential in signing Alice in Chains , Soundgarden , Pearl Jam and others. In 2000, Ron took over as President of North Star Media and served until 2009, when he left to partner with Steve Winogradsky to found entertainment law firm Winogradsky/Sobel, which provides legal services, artist development, music publishing/administration, corporate strategic media development, and music clearance and licensing services. He also served on the Board of Directors of the California Copyright Conference for 18 years, was chair of the Music Business Division at McNally Smith College of Music from 2009-2010, and is a frequent speaker at USC, CSU Northridge and UCLA.\n\"For me, I'm thinking about two, four, six years in the future when these kids graduate, what's the market going to look like? Five, eight, ten years ago we didn't have the words Facebook, Twitter, Uber or Lyft – in music things are changing just as rapidly. I'm trying to drive the curriculum to be just as proactive and teach skills like critical thinking, so our graduates are prepared to evolve with the industry,\" said Ron Sobel .\nVocal Department Chair David Joyce won a Grammy Award for his work performing with Clare Fischer 2+2 Band , and brings with him a wealth of experience performing, recording and producing with artists including Natalie Cole , Chris Isaak , David Byrne and many others.

Joyce takes the position after already serving on the faculty at LACM. Commenting on his vision for the program and new curriculum updates, he says, \"I have a big vision for what's possible for the students here in the vocal program, the standards are high, the workload is intense, but they have a great opportunity to learn a lot, to grow a lot, and to create contacts that will help carry them forward.\"\nWatch an interview with Music Business Department Advisory Chair Ron Sobel and Music Business Department Chair Erin Workman :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHYChy5zJM\nWatch an interview with Vocal Department Chair David Joyce :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qPQYR9phak\nThese additions to the staff at LACM come at a time of exponential growth for the school.
