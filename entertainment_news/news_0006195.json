Nothing at all. A free education makes sense and nobody can argue its importance. But when it comes down to the reality of it an education is most certainly a privilege. As for people telling themselves it is a right well good luck!\nWho are your parents? Do they flatter you and tell you the world owes you something?\nAs a child I would tell me dad how unfair a matter was and he would smile at me and tell me how unfair life is. He never budged and bless my good dad he lives still and even at the age of 40 when my questionable decisions have left me vulnerable. My dad will still tell me what he told me when I was young.\nWork gentlemen, work... I remember complaining about the government once and he asked me, \"Is there a law that says you may not become a millionaire? \" I said no and he said \"shut up and work gentleman.\"\nI love my father so much. He never ever lied to me. He still doesn't.\nIf your parents tell you that someone owes you something in this world. Then first look at their lives and see what they achieved. See the excuses they have and the excuses they still make.\nMy dad came here in tough times, he couldn't speak any English.\nPeople talk about inequality, its the quality of parents we have.\nYes, Wits is expensive and probably should cater for the poor. But lets get practical and change the way we think. Protesting is just protesting, it does not solve the problem.\nVote for leaders that make your rand go further.\nVote for leaders that do not buy expensive cars .\nVote for a better future. No whites in SA owe anybody anything.\nThey are part of the freedom that we all have.\nIf your parents have nothing , blame them. Don't blame others .\nGod says that all the silver and all the gold is his.\nMake your prayers and supplications known when you wake up and live with expectation.\nI cannot blame anybody for my failures and nor can you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:32:24.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
