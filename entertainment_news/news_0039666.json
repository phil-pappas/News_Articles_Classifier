A proposal from Riverside City Manager John Russo known as \"Chow Alley\" would extend the Main Street pedestrian mall south of City Hall as a place for outdoor dining and events.\nConcept: The plan would close Main Street between 10th and 11th streets and install landscaping and cafe tables. Parking lots between Main and Market streets would house food vendors and public art.\nPros/cons: Visitors and workers at courthouses and other downtown buildings would have more options for lunch and leisure, but some might object to the loss of parking along Main Street and in two nearby lots.\nMeeting: The City Council's land use committee will discuss the proposal at 3 p.m. Thursday in the council chambers at Riverside City Hall, 3900 Main St.\nAnyone who has bemoaned a lack of lunch options near Riverside’s downtown courthouses, law offices and government buildings may cheer the city’s proposal to create a pleasant outdoor space with food vendors, public art and a farmers market.\nKnown as “Chow Alley,” the proposal from Riverside City Manager John Russo would take advantage of underused space – city and county parking lots between Market and Main streets south of 10th Street.\nIt also would call for closing Main Street between 10th and 11th streets to cars and installing landscaping and cafe tables to make it an extension of the pedestrian mall that now ends on the north side of City Hall.\nThe parking lots and a vacant building between Provident Bank and the new public defender offices would give way to shady areas, public art and structures such as shipping containers that could house pop-up restaurants or other culinary offerings.\nThe area could be a daytime spot for people to eat or relax, and public events could be held there at night.\n“I think it’s an exciting idea, but it really needs to be fleshed out,” said Councilman Mike Gardner, who represents downtown. “We’ve always wanted to try to bring more of the entertainment district south of 10th Street.”\nSome downtown visitors and workers were intrigued by the proposal.\n“That’d be cool,” Riverside County Superior Court Commissioner Rob Nagby said Wednesday. “For jurors, there’s not too many places to eat around here.”\nNagby usually brings his lunch – he’s watching his weight – and eats in the courthouse, he said, but he’d probably take his food outside if there were tables and shade. He also lives nearby and would enjoy checking out events there while walking his dogs.\nBlanca Briseno, an Eastvale resident who was downtown Wednesday for jury service, worried that the plan would make it harder to park near the courthouse.\nBut having more places to eat within walking distance could be a plus, she said, because “you don’t want to get in your car and then lose your parking space.”\nGardner wasn’t sure how many parking spaces would disappear if the Chow Alley plan went forward, but he said it’s not hard to find parking downtown if you’re willing to walk a little.\nAn online satellite photo of the area appears to show about 110 spots in the two lots and along the street.\nCity leaders have discussed the idea with Riverside County officials, who agreed to lease the county-owned space to the city for $1 a year, according to a city report.\nThe proposal would cost an estimated $1.18 million for design, construction and other expenses. It’s projected to bring in about $56,700 per year from leases to vendors, which adds up to $1.7 million in revenue over 30 years.\nThe council’s land use committee will discuss the proposal at 3 p.m. Thursday. The proposal would need approval from the full City Council.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9461 or arobinson@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxg14-b88534048z.120151008172705000g6dcf7dr.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxg14-b88534048z.120151008172705000g6dcf7dr.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:40:45.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
