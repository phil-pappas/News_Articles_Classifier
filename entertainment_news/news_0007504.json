In 2005, Whedon wrote and directed a feature film sequel, \"Serenity,\" but that still wasn't enough. \nYears after \"Firefly\" left the air, the cast still reunites frequently for special events and conventions, including this year's New York Comic Con. \nSo when someone asked Nathan Fillion (Captain Mal Reynolds), Alan Tudyk (Hoban Washburne), Gina Torres (Zoë Washburne) and Jewel Staite (Kaylee Frye) if they would come back for a second season, they jumped at the suggestion. \n\"Full-time, please,\" Fillion said, according to Variety . \nUnfortunately, \"Firefly\" wasn't the first to fall victim to network brass with itchy trigger fingers. Here are a few others shows canceled too early: MARK SELIGER/ABC “My So-Called Life” is considered one of the best high school dramas, but fans only saw one season of Angela Chase’s life. \n\"My So-Called Life\" \nThe ABC show starring Claire Danes, Jared Leto and Brian Krakow, is considered one of the first teen dramas to tackle modern, real life issues. The show's star, Angela Chase, deals with child abuse, teenage alcoholism, drug use and school violence. \nThe show lasted just 19 episodes from August 1994 to January 1995. \n\"Veronica Mars\" \nWriter and producer Rob Thomas' noir drama about teenage P.I. Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) combined season-long story arcs and weekly mysteries as Veronica and her friends struggle to move on from devastating events. \nThe show lasted just three seasons on UPN and The CW before cancellation, despite Thomas' pitch for a fourth season with Veronica in the FBI. \nThomas' characters have come back to life recently via silver screen, an effort from $5.7 million fan-raised Kickstarter, novels and a web spin-off, but fans still want more. RON P. JAFFE/WARNER BROS Rob Thomas’ “Veronica Mars” has recently found life again in books and a movie, but the show’s three-season run still wasn’t enough for fans. NBC “Freaks and Geeks” launched the careers of most of its stars but didn’t find much fame in its own right while it was still on TV. \n\"Freaks and Geeks\" \nBefore they were stars, Linda Cardellini, John Francis Daley, James Franco, Samm Levine, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Martin Starr and Busy Philipps were just high school students in Paul Feig and Judd Apatow's \"Freaks and Geeks.\" \n\"Freaks and Geeks\" launched the careers of nearly everyone who appeared in the show, from the main cast to guest stars, but, while it was critically-acclaimed, NBC canceled it after just 18 episodes. \n\"Twin Peaks\" \nConsidered a cult classic, Mark Frost and David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\" follows FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper's (Kyle MacLachlan) investigation into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in a creepy small town in Washington. \n\"Twin Peaks\" garnered 14 Emmy nominations in its first season and four in its second, but low ratings caused ABC to cancel the show after 30 episodes. \nLuckily for fans, a 1992 feature film, \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me,\" serves as a prequel and epilogue to the series and Showtime will air a limited series with most of the main cast next year. ABC Photo Archives/ABC Photo Archives/Getty Images “Twin Peaks,” which wil return soon in a limited series, was canceled after 30 episodes. \n\"Sports Night\" \nFor all of his success, Aaron Sorkin's TV shows rarely end as he wants them to: they're either canceled or he leaves and loses control. \n\"Sports Night,\" the show about a fictional sports news show and its cast of characters (Josh Charles, Peter Krause, Felicity Huffman, Joshua Malina, Sabrina Lloyd and Robert Guillaume), was canceled after two seasons and 45 episodes on ABC. VIVIAN ZINK/ABC Aaron Sorkin allowed “Sports Night” to end after two seasons so he could focus on “The West Wing.” \nSorkin, however, had the chance to bring the show to HBO, Showtime or USA, but turned down the opportunity to focus on \"The West Wing.\" \n\"Bunheads\" \nAfter the immense success of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Amy Sherman-Palladino looked like she had another masterpiece with \"Bunheads,\" about a former Las Vegas showgirl who ends up teaching dance in the sleepy town of Paradise, California. Adam Taylor/ABC Family “Bunheads,” from Gilmore Girls creater Amy Sherman-Palladino, was canceled after two seasons. \nStarring Sutton Foster, Kelly Bishop, Kaitlyn Jenkins, Julia Goldani Telles, Bailey Buntain and Emma Dumont, \"Bunheads\" lasted just 18 episodes before ABC Family canceled it. \n\"Enlisted\" \nKevin Biegel's \"Enlisted,\" starring Geoff Stults, Chris Lowell, Parker Young, Keith David and Angelique Cabral, was doomed from the start. \nFox began airing the half-hour comedy about three brothers, all soldiers stationed in the same unit in Florida, mid-season on a Friday night, a timeslot that rarely succeeds. Episodes were also aired out of order to try to put the stronger plots first, but instead just confused viewers. Jennifer Clasen/FOX “Enlisted,” a comedy about a ragtag group of soldiers on a base in Florida, aired out of order and on a Friday night, a death trap for even the best shows. \n\"Enlisted\" was pulled from the air after nine episodes, with the four final episodes airing two months later. \n\"Pushing Daisies\" \nBryan Fuller's gorgeously shot \"Pushing Daisies,\" starring Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Chi McBride, Kristin Chenoweth, Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz, focused on Ned, a pie-maker who was able to bring things back to life with a single touch. BOB D'AMICO/© 2007 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. “Pushing Daisies” was canceled after 22 episodes. \nThe show was nominated for 57 awards and won 18 of them, including seven Emmys, but was canceled after two seasons and 22 episodes. \n\"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\" \nNahnatchka Khan's \"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\" never had the ring of reality, but that might have been part of its appeal. \nJune Colburn (Dreama Walker) moves to New York and in with party girl Chloe (Krysten Ritter), the eponymous b****, as she tries to figure out her new life after her company shuts down on her first day; James Van Der Beek also stars as a fictionalized version of himself. Bob D'Amico/ABC “Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23” lasted just 26 episodes. \nThe over-the-top show ran out of order throughout its second season before being canceled by ABC, which would later run the remaining eight unaired episodes. \n\"Enlightened\" \nThe HBO show about a 40-year-old woman (Laura Dern) who tries to get her to life back together after a mental breakdown at work, won her a Golden Globe for best actress in 2012 and was nominated for a Best Television Series at the Golden Globes in 2012 and Outstanding Lead Actress and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series at the 2013 Emmys. Lacey Terrell/ HBO Laura Dern’s “Enlightened” lasted two seasons. \nDespite its critical reception, and a three-season plan by creators Dern and Mike White, HBO canceled the show after two seasons and 18 episodes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:26:17.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
