The Norman Rockwell exhibit at The Fort Collins Museum of Art is entering its final weeks. The show has been a surprise hit, rekindling a local admiration for the country's most sentimental — yes, some may say overly sentimental — artist. The show's strength comes from its exhaustive look at the artist's work as an illustrator. It includes all 323 covers he did for the \"Saturday Evening Post,\" assembled by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass. The scenes track decades of quaint American history, detailing the way we celebrated holidays, raised children and fought wars. The museum is planning several side events, all listed on its website. Through Nov. 1, Fort Collins Museum of Art , 201 South College Ave., Fort Collins. Adults $7. 970-482-2787 or ftcma.org . — Ray Mark Rinaldi\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:06:10.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
