She will be the first person to cut somebody else's throat if she has to,\" Roopal told PTI.\nThe 26-year-old actress is, however, all praise for Mandana's former partner on the show, actor Keith Sequeira.\n\"I want Keith to win because he is sensible, smart and genuinely nice. I really want him to go ahead. He is very mature, the way he talks shows that... He has clear, nice chances of winning the show,\" she said.\nKeith, whose girlfriend Rochelle Rao is also on the show, hit headlines for his bonding with Mandana while they were tied together as a part of the 'Double Trouble' concept.\nBut the young star feels people read too much into things. \"Keith is very caring and friendly with all the girls.\nMaybe with others it was not shown and only the part with Mandana was shown but as a co-contesatnt I am saying there is nothing going on between Mandana and Keith.\"\nRoopal said Kishwer Merchant and her boyfriend Suyyash Rai have come well prepared on the show.\n\"They have come prepared with what they have to do on the show and Prince (Narula) is a part of their preparation.\"\nShe added the friendship between the couple and Prince isbecause they about each other participation on the show from before.\n\"Prince has always been friendly with Kishwer and Suyyash and I am quite sure that is because they have a lot of common friends.\n\"Those common friends even called me before entering the house saying, 'So and so friend of mine is entering so you can get friendly...' I am sure he has done the same with those two as well because they are friends with that particular person. So, they knew about each other entering the house from before and that's why they're playing in a group,\" she said.\nRoopal, a popular face on TV, blames less visibility as the reason behind her ouster.\n\"I went inside the house for an experience. I wanted to stay for long but only by being myself. I do not have a habit of reacting to every small thing. This show is about visibility, which I did not get hence I am out.\"\nHer exit followed ex-boyfriend Ankit Gera's elimination.\nRoopal said though people expected fireworks between the duo, they were least interested in picking fights with each other.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:45:53.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
