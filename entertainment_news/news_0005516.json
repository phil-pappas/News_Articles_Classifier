Comment Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:42 PM Updated at 2:46 PM Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:42 PM Updated at 2:46 PM Dance Moms star Abby Lee Miller has been indicted on fraud charges, Pittsburgh's Action News 4 reports. Miller was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets, and false bankruptcy declarations, allegedly hiding approximately $755,000. \"Federal bankruptcy proceedings can be a lifesaver for honest individuals overwhelmed by debt resulting from any number of legitimate reasons, but allegations of fraud and abuse threaten the integrity of the bankruptcy process and the public's trust in it. We take our responsibility to pursue allegations of bankruptcy fraud seriously,\" said Special Agent in Charge Scott S. Smith of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Pittsburgh Division. The 20-count indictment alleges that when Miller reorganized her dance studio in 2010, she schemed to defraud the bankruptcy court by hiding the income she earned in 2012 and 2013. She allegedly created bank accounts to hide the income and instructed others to conceal income.
