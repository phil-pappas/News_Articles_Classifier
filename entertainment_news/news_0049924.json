George RR Martin clutches his award from the recent Emmys. Photo: Michael Kovac \nGame of Thrones creator George RR Martin has teased fans by slamming the door on longstanding rumours of a blockbuster movie finale – and then just as quickly opening it again.\nThe latest round of GoT film speculation fired up after Martin reportedly said at an Emmy Awards after-party that it was all happening.\nBut now in a blog post Martin has urged fans not to believe all that they read, \"especially not online\".\n\"I don't know where this latest round of 'there's going to be a Game of Thrones movie' nonsense is coming from, but suddenly it is everywhere, and all of us connected with the show and HBO are being bombarded,\" he said. \"But nothing has changed.\"\nMartin admitted that he might had been the original source of the rumours of a series-ending film \"three or four years ago\".\nAdvertisement But, just as all hope was fading, he added that the idea remained \"powerfully attractive\".\n\"Not just to me, but to many people connected with the show,\" he continued. \"Actors, directors, producers, writers. How not? It would be a great way to end.\"\nAfter that definite maybe, Martin appeared to back away again.\n\"Which doesn't mean it is going to happen,\" he said. \"There is great enthusiasm for the notion, sure, but not necessarily from HBO. They are in the TV business, not the feature film business.\n\"And those of you with long memories may recall all the rumours about a Sopranos movie... a Rome movie... a Deadwood movie. Rumours is all they were. And that's all this one is too, at least for now.\"\nAnd then, having muddied the pool still further and left GoT tragics much to ponder and analyse, the great man signed off – but not before taking a tilt at both journos and brass band fans\n\"Don't take any of this stuff seriously,\" he said. \"Clickbait journalism is to journalism as military music is to music.\"\nGlad that's all settled, then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:15:55.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
