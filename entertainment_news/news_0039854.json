Dunant came across the aftermath of the battle, in which some 20,000 were killed, and enlisted the help of civilians - mostly women - to help tend the wounded. His observations and written account describing the humanitarianism of volunteers in comforting the wounded and dying - the essence and inspiration of the Red Cross ‘brand’ - resulted in the first Geneva Convention in 1864. This set out the principle of neutrality among army medical personnel and volunteers aiding injured soldiers, which later evolved into the seven core principles of the International Red Cross - humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. \nThis legacy flourished during New Zealand’s wartime experiences. During WWI the Red Cross was characterised as \"drawing the net of mercy through a sea of pain\" through fundraising and domestic skills to the care of returned men, Professor Tennant writes. The uniformed branches of Red Cross nurses and VAs (Voluntary Aids) expanded during WWII, along with provision of food parcels sent to POWs. This involved intensive volunteer labour to fundraise, pack and send some 4700 cases of goods overseas weekly during WWII. \nNapier quake a milestone for disaster response \nThe 1931 Napier earthquake prompted the development of a major disaster relief effort, which has since evolved to encompass highly sophisticated disaster preparedness, management, training and response teams that now extends to many neighbouring Pacific nations. \nA section of the book is devoted to the colourful campaign posters of the many Red Cross relief projects, including a dramatic poster featuring spray can art, designed by Saatchi and Saatchi for the New Zealand Red Cross in 1995, with a missile and the words \"Only one thing stops the Red Cross.\" \nProfessor Tennant lectured in history at Massey’s School of Humanities for 30 years before the start of this project and has written books on the history of the non-profit sector, including The Fabric of Welfare: Voluntary Organisations, Government, and Welfare in New Zealand 1840-2005 (2007). \nShe says just about every New Zealander feels some affinity with the Red Cross, which has 97 million volunteers, staff and members worldwide. The New Zealand Red Cross is one of 188 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world. Professor Tennant aimed to write an accessible history complete with profiles of key personalities who helped shaped the organisation. She is passionate about the role of a historian in connecting stories and knowledge of the past to a wider audience. \n\"Each national Red Cross Society has its own history which involves an interplay between local conditions and membership of an international ‘Movement’ - an expression which implies that the Red Cross is not simply a charitable society, or an international non-governmental organisation, but something larger…and potentially transformative,\" she says in the book. \nThe hardcover volume is published by the New Zealand Red Cross and can be ordered through its website. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
