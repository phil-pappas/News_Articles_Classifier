During his monologue, he poked fun at himself and brought out his \" 30 Rock \" co-stars for a TV reunion. \"I'm back. It feels so good to be here. If you didn't see it on the news, I was in a terrible car crash a year ago. It was awful. But it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world,\" he began. \"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?' \" the 49-year-old funnyman joked about his traumatic brain injury. \"But the truth is, I never did! I might actually be a few points higher now.\" The comedian thanked his comedy family for their support. Alec Baldwin , Tina Fey , Jane Krakowski , and Jack McBrayer then joined him in a fake 2012 episode of the NBC sitcom in which Morgan's character \"almost died.\" Morgan later reprised his role as animal enthusiast, Brian Fellow that he first introduced during his \"SNL\" stint in 1999. He also spoofed \"Family Feud\" and teamed up with Demi Lovato in \" The Martian \" parody. On top of that, the show did a sketch of Democratic presidential debate with Baldwin as Jim Webb and Larry David as Bernie Sanders. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Saturday Night Live News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:50:30.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
