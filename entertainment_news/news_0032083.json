The settlement covers Beck's fans who purchased Beck's, Beck’s Light, Beck’s Dark and Beck's Octoberfest beers since May 2011.\nOnce they get over the psychic trauma of having been hoodwinked into drinking American beer, betrayed Beck's drinkers have until November 20 to go to Becksbeersettlement.com and claim a refund of up to $50 per household, provided they have receipts.\nBut even without proof of purchase, you can still get up to $12 in cold, hard Beck's cash.\nThe Becks' brouhaha is the first semi-alarming report stemming from the New Beer Order created when Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to purchase SABMiller for $104 billion, joining longtime rivals Bud and Miller and creating a super brewery that will be the world's biggest beermaker by far.", "external_links": ["https://www.becksbeersettlement.com/Home.aspx", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-approves-settlement-over-becks-beer-1445397277?alg=y"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:24:52.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
