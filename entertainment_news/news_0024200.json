He was detained for trying to meet family of truck driver who was burnt alive in Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir last week. Malik was stopped by security forces when he entered the house. He was then not allowed to enter as he forcefully tried to enter the house of the victim. Malik had gone there to condole the death of the Zahid who was killed by a mob. Zahid was killed by a mob after a romor spread that he was smuggling cows. Although police who reached the spot later rushed him to hospital, he succumbed to injuries. Police recovered ten cows from the truck. Others who were present had fled after the scene as the mob approached . (Also Read: Mob kills man in Himachal Pradesh for smuggling cows) Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had expressed shock over the incident and held politics of hate and intolerance responsible for it. He had said, ”One more precious life has been lost to the politics of hate and intolerance that is posing a grave challenge to the state and country’s plurality. I have no words to condemn the dastardly act which consumed the life of a poor and innocent young boy for no fault of his.” Protest was witnessed in South Kashmir as news of Zahid’s death spread in the valley. However, police investigation said that cows in the truck died due to food poisoning and cow slaughter was just a rumor. The rumor was just to create communal tension in the area. \n  4:16 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:10:13.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
