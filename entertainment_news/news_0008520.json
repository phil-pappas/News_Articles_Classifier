The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn’t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel. Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years. Not since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life — for good, for bad, forever. Finders Keepers by Stephen King is an ambitious and well-crafted hard-boiled thriller which can be read as a stand-alone though it is the middle book of a trilogy. Its masterful pacing and riveting plotting makes it a heart thumping read, intensely thrilling and absolutely gripping. Wolf Mountain: A Werewolf Novel of Haiti By JR Pinto; 224 pages; Aug. 30, 2015 In the tent cities of Haiti, beneath the light of the full moon, a howl cuts through the night. Something ancient has come down from the mountains … to feed. Back in New Jersey, Asher Greene spots an item in the paper about werewolf attacks in Haiti. In a desperate effort to jumpstart his career in journalism – and his life – he flies to Port-au-Prince on his own dime to cover the story. Fate throws him into Haiti just as “Baby Doc” Duvalier is returning from exile, giving Greene the scoop of his lifetime. His success in Haiti now assured, Asher Greene pursues the werewolf story with the help of Coco Bernard, his Haitian-American guide and translator. He expects to write a simple story on native superstitions. Instead, the killings continue. Bodies are ripped apart by the light of the full moon. They follow a trail that leads to the chimeras – the deadly Haitian gangs freed by the earthquake. And, behind it all, the legend of the jé-rouge – the Haitian werewolf. Greene pursues the story to disprove the legend but is instead led into a world of sorcery and the occult.
