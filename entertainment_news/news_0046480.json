The structure also sheds light on the gaps in memory that exist between parents and children, Kevin said.\n“One of the things that I’ve realized over time is that some of my memories were not accurate. So one of the things we didn’t want to do was pollute each others’ timelines,” he said.\nOne pivotal part of the story is when Alex came out as a teenager after Kevin asked him if he was gay. It’s a decision the father says he later came to regret.\n“I had robbed him of an important part of his own development by guessing and leading the conversation,” Kevin said. “I definitely should’ve waited because it did end up impacting our relationship for a very long time.”\nAlex says he often relied on teenage journals to recall the past, and that the writing process offered ample time for “self-reflection.” Through reading his father’s chapters, he says he discovered a more vulnerable side to his TV-personality dad.\n“Learning that dad wasn’t as perfect as his TV glossy image … it was a revelation for me.”\nThe book’s tagline says the father and son confronted “hard truths” to become “better men,” and Newman says that meant looking at his own prejudices.\n“I had to frankly confront my own homophobia and get over it,” he said.\n“It’s made me a better man because, as much as I embraced Alex (and) loved him unconditionally, it took me a long time to adjust to his new life, his new friends, his boyfriends, and not have visceral feelings about it myself,” he said.\n“All Out” was published by Random House Canada and hits shelves Tuesday.\nPhotos “All Out,” a new memoir co-written by journalist Kevin Newman, deals with his son Alex coming out as gay and the challenges of self-acceptance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:44:43.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
