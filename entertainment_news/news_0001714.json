We now have full confirmation that the album will be released on November 6, along with a video for two brand new songs off of it, \"Flesh Without Blood,\" and \"Life in the Vivid Dream.\"\nThe video was directed and edited by Grimes herself and it's the perfect way to kick off Halloween week, if you're into that being a thing that gets kicked off.
