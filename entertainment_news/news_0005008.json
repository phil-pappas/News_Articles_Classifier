Vin Diesel , who voiced the character, recently shared his vision of how Groot may return in the sequel. \"I've talked to [director] James Gunn about that. I can't give it away but I would love to see gigantic Groot,\" Diesel told IGN. The hunky actor went on teasing, \"I'd love to throw him into a forest and see how much mass that he consumes after devouring all the trees.\" At the end of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", Rocket planted one of the splinters of Groot and it grew into baby Groot. In contrary to Diesel's wish, the movie helmer Gunn recently said fans could expect to see a younger, smaller Groot in the sequel. Besides Diesel, other main actors including Chris Pratt , Zoe Saldana , Dave Bautista and Bradley Cooper are expected to return for \" Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \" which is slated to arrive on May 5, 2017 in the States. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:18:24.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
