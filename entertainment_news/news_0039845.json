Photo: Supplied \nFREE TO AIR Agatha Christie’s Partners in Crime ABC, 8.30pm  \nThe third instalment in this terribly British crime caper takes a darker turn after Tommy (David Walliams) is given a mission to steal a file from MI5 – or his son’s life will be in danger. He must keep his mission secret from Tuppence (Jessica Raine) – but of course he gets her in on it.  While the tone is more earnest, there are still some quaint  Cold War gags to be had in this final episode, and Raine and Walliams are  fun to watch.  \nLadyboys: The Band ABC2, 9.10pm  \nAdvertisement This documentary series feels like a reality program parody, but apparently it’s ‘‘real’’. Former boilermaker Scott, from the north of England, left Blighty to live in Thailand, like 85,000 of his countrymen, and (also apparently like many of his countrymen), has settled down with a ladyboy, Pang. She runs a ladyboy bar but Scott’s visa prevents him from helping out – so he’s found himself a new venture: he’s teamed up with Barry Upton, former member of ’70s Eurovision winners Brotherhood of Man and the producer who created late ’90s pop-dance supergroup Steps – you know where this is going. Upton lives in Pattaya and runs the local radio station, and is dead keen on Scott’s idea to create an all-ladyboy band. They’ve got the name – Gurlz (no, really) – now they just need to find the perfect ladyboys. Tonight the pair hold auditions for the clutch of ladyboys who have turned up after Scott and Barry handed out flyers at ladyboy bars. A highlight is Upton explaining that for a successful five-piece band, “only one or two need to be able to sing”. \nYou’re the Worst  Eleven, 10.30pm  \nThis Millennial single-camera ‘‘anti-relationship’’ comedy has a feel of Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney’s British series Catastrophe about it, although the setting and the gags are probably a bit more edgy, if not always as funny. The ‘‘non-relationship’’ of Gretchen (Aya Cash) and Jimmy (Chris Geere) continues its odd course as Jimmy finally gets to see Gretchen’s apartment, albeit briefly; he flees when he discovers what a frat boy-like, disgusting mess she lives in. Jimmy’s flatmate Edgar (Desmin Borges), meanwhile – arguably the best character – is struggling with his PTSD, and after his emotional speech at a war memorial opening is cut short, thinks he’s found a sympathetic ear in some veterans keen to hear his war stories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:32:07.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
