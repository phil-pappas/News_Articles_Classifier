A lesser work from a great playwright, this is O'Neill's only comedy, a leisurely and sweet remembrance of things past that takes it title from a line in \"The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám.\" KEVIN BERNE/AMERICAN CONSERVATORY THEATER Sid Davis (played by Dan Hiatt, second from right) regales the Miller family with gags in Eugene O'Neil's \"Ah, Wilderness,\" being presented by American Conservatory Theater through Nov. 8. ( Kevin Berne ) \nFramed by the gauzy walls of Ralph Funicello's scenic design, \"Wilderness\" summons us back to 1906, to the dreamy realm of memory and missing. It's a gentle Fourth of July visit to a Connecticut beach house kissed with fog and sea air and notably missing the gloom of \"Journey.\" This is the past as a sun-dappled paradise, a place untroubled by loss or regret. \nRichard (an exuberant Thomas Stagnitta) is a gawky 17-year-old writer with a head full of Shaw and Ibsen, eager to prove his idealism. He fancies himself a rebel, penning lusty valentines to his sweetheart Muriel (a fetching Rosa Palmeri) and ranting about the sham of American traditions, from Independence Day to temperance. O'Neill reportedly based the character on himself and his own intellectual bravado as a young man. Advertisement \nRichard's siblings are nothing less than heartwarming. Eleven-year-old Tommy (Brandin Francis Osborne) longs to set off fireworks. Sister Mildred (Christina Liang) lives to practice her signature and tease her brothers. Richard's parents, the pragmatic newspaperman Nat (a deft Anthony Fusco) and his prim wife Essie (a wry Rachel Ticotin) are suitably doting, although mother dear can't abide by Richard's budding socialism or his fascination with some \"fast\" girl named Hedda. It's all quite precious. Even Richard's drunken liaison with a lady of the night named Belle (Caitlan Taylor) is downright cute. Although nothing touches the mixture of ecstasy and angst that radiates from Richard's moonlit tryst with Muriel. \nStill there are hints of his later and far darker masterpiece here. You can hear the echoes of the damned James and Mary Tyrone in the supporting characters, in the bitterness of the perpetually soused uncle Sid (Dan Hiatt) and in the gentility of the spinster aunt Lily (Margo Hall.) Both characters try to keep their chins up but it is clear they can't live with or without each other. They have lost their gamble on love. \nBut make no mistake, this is a long-winded romantic comedy where the shadows of life, the intimate barbs of the long-married, for instance, are dispersed by the general air of happiness and affection. Stangl's nuanced ensemble finds the truth and university of the text, the brilliant ways O'Neill captures the awkwardness of a first kiss or the regrets of middle age, but it's still a long day's journey into nostalgia. \nContact Karen D'Souza at 408-271-3772.
