Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, his Punjab counterpart Parkash Singh Badal, Rosaiah, some top judges, besides Governor ESL Narasimhan, would attend the event, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said here tonight. Prime Minister Narendra Modi would lay the foundation stone for the capital city on Vijayadashmi (October 22) and the state government is making elaborate arrangements for the event. Naidu visited the place, where the foundation stone would be laid and reviewed the arrangements made with ministers and senior officials stating that there could be some rumour- mongers out to create some trouble during the function, he appealed to the people to remain alert and not be carried away by any such thing.

Congress bifurcated the state without the new Andhra Pradesh not even having its own capital city, he said. He also disapproved of Opposition Leader and YSR Congress chief Y S Jaganmohan Reddy announcing that he need not be invited for the event and that he would not attend. On the oppositionâ€™s demand that the PM should announce special category status for Andhra Pradesh during his visit, Naidu reiterated that the Centre should hand hold the state till it stood on its own feet so that it can contribute to the national growth. \nModified Date: October 21, 2015 2:27 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:37:26.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
