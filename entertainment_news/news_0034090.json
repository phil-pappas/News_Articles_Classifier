Another shows bodies piled up and torched at a garbage dump.\nView gallery Relatives and friends of the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa take part in a demonstration in Igu … Independent investigators and parents of the students have rejected the government's conclusion that the cartel killed and incinerated the students at the landfill after confusing them with Los Rojos gang members.\nOmar Garcia, one of the students who survived the attack, called for a boycott of the movie.\n\"This is part of a campaign to smear us and back the government's version (of the events),\" Garcia told AFP.\n\"The investigation must continue to get to the truth,\" he said, charging that the film is a \"new attempt to by the government to mislead.\"\n\"It's a total lack of respect because the filmmakers never approached us or the parents\" to find out if they agreed to be represented in the movie, Garcia said. \nView gallery A masked man paints graffiti during a demonstration in Iguala, Guerrero State, Mexico, on September  … Juan Jesus Montes, who was among 200 actors to take part in a casting call, said he only learned what the movie was about on the first day of shooting.\nThe 34-year-old actor portrayed a fictional character nicknamed \"El Flaco,\" who accuses another student of being a drug gang member.\n\"I'm an actor. I went to act, nothing more. Given that it's a delicate issue, I did it with respect and started checking all available information (about the case),\" Montes said.\nMontes, who has appeared in soap operas, said he felt \"between a rock and a hard place\" due to the students' criticism of the film.\n\n- 'Alternative, historic or uncomfortable truth?'-\n\nMenendez said he decided to use actors for half of the movie because there are no images of \"key moments\" in the drama.\n\"That's why we decided to recreate and dramatize it,\" he told Radio Formula, adding that the other half of the movie is in the classic documentary style.\nMenendez acknowledged that his film is closer to the conclusions of the attorney general's office, which months ago declared that its investigation was the \"historic truth.\"\nHis movie, he said, \"is neither a historic truth nor an alternative truth. It's an uncomfortable truth.\" \nThe Iguala case has inspired others to write books about the horrific night. Even a comic book, \"Vivos se los Llevaron\" (They Took Them Alive) has been made.\nNext Tuesday, another documentary about the tragedy will make its debut, \"Mirar Morir\" (Staring at Death), focusing on the army's role in the case.\nArts & Entertainment Media Mexico City college students", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:50:44.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
