(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP) More News Headlines The Associated Press LONDON — \nGreek director Athina Rachel Tsangari's comedy of manhood \"Chevalier\" was named best picture at the London Film Festival on Saturday, during a ceremony that honored Cate Blanchett with a major career award. \nIt was a fitting finale to a festival that sought to showcase the work of talented women both onscreen and behind the camera. \nPolish director Pawel Pawlikowski, who headed a prize jury that included actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Kristin Scott Thomas, said Tsangari's film about a battle of egos among six men on a yacht was \"both a hilarious comedy and a deeply disturbing statement on the condition of Western humanity.\" \nTsangari — whose film beat much-praised contenders including child-soldier saga \"Beasts of No Nation\" and searing Holocaust drama \"Son of Saul\" — thanked \"all of the strong women who have inspired me — and all of the strong men.\" \nDuring a black-tie dinner ceremony at London's 17th-century Banqueting House, Blanchett was awarded the British Film Institute Fellowship by her \"Lord of the Rings\" co-star Ian McKellen, in recognition of a career that has already netted her two Oscars, for \"The Aviator\" and \"Blue Jasmine.\" \nThe award was preceded by a compilation of clips from Blanchett's 20-year film career, interspersed with praise from directors including Peter Jackson, Todd Haynes and Richard Eyre. \n\"It's a cross between an obituary and a tribute,\" Blanchett said. \"I feel like I've died and gone to heaven.\" \nBlanchett said she'd never thought of her work as career, or even a choice. Acting, she said, \"chose me.\" \nBlanchett starred in two films at the festival: Haynes' 1950s-set lesbian romance \"Carol\" and James Vanderbilt's \"Truth,\" in which she plays TV news producer Mary Mapes, who was fired over a story about former U.S. President George W. Bush 's military service. \nAmerican director Robert Eggers' Pilgrim horror film \"The Witch\" won the festival's first-feature prize. Jennifer Peedom's Himalayan study \"Sherpa\" was named best documentary and \"An Old Dog's Diary\" by Shai Heredia and Shumona Goel took the short-film trophy. \nThe 59th annual London festival aimed to put strong women center stage, opening with Sarah Gavron's political drama \"Suffragette\" and featuring 46 female-directed films among its 240 features. \nThe 12-day event brought a slew of awards-worthy female performances, including Blanchett and Rooney Mara as clandestine lovers in \"Carol,\" Brie Larson as a mother in an extreme situation in \"Room,\" and Maggie Smith as a redoubtable eccentric in \"The Lady in the Van.\" \nFounded in 1957 to show the best of the year's world cinema to a British audience, the London Film Festival has boosted its profile in recent years with bigger movies , more glittering stars and prizes to boost emerging awards-season contenders. \nIts prize-winners have a strong track record at the Oscars. The last two London winners, Andrey Zvyagintsev's \"Leviathan\" and Pawlikowski's \"Ida,\" faced off in this year's foreign-language Academy Award race. \"Ida\" won. \nThe festival wraps up Sunday with Danny Boyle's \" Steve Jobs ,\" starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple founder. \n___ \nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:18:40.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
