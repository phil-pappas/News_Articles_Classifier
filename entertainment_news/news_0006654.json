He is married to the “ethnically ambiguous” Tracy (Vanessa Lachey, “Dads”). They have a 4-year-old Asian daughter, Sadie (Alex Jayne Go), who is curious about her naughty bits.\nTheir African-American besties are stand-up comedian Russell (Tone Bell, “Bad Judge”) and wife and pediatric resident Angie (Bresha Webb, “Grey’s Anatomy”).\nThe excuse of a plot has the quartet coming into a set of Jay Z tickets, courtesy of Angie’s ex, and sparking Russell’s jealousy.\n“I misunderstood,” he tells his wife. “I thought when we got married, we were going to stop dating other people.”\nRussell can’t resist snooping in his wife’s cellphone for messages. That’s kind of where the story ends for them.\nMitch and Tracy have a crisis: Can they find a baby sitter who meets Tracy’s exacting requirements so they can go to the concert?\nThey have other neighbors who are bringing home yet another­ girl baby, but Tracy­ thinks it’s bad form to steal a sitter.\n“I’m just going to ask them, Jew to Jew,” Mitch says.\nThey seem to find an ideal child-minder, until Russell thinks he recognizes her from another line of work.\nPerhaps NBC hopes “Truth Be Told” will strike the same gold as “The Carmichael Show.” The difference comes down to viewpoint and focus, two qualities this show lacks. These couples are just the sort you’d dodge at the office or at a party, so why you’d want to unwind with them on your TV is NBC’s headache.\n“Truth Be Told”: Not much fun here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:24:50.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
