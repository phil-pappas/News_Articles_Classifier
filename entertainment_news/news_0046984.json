It originally screened on German TV, which accounts for its 148 minute running time.\nThe Choir\nRed Violin director Francois Girard returns with another music-themed film, this one starring Dustin Hoffman as one of those hard-but-inspirational teachers so beloved of screenwriters. In this case he's the choirmaster at a prestigious music school. Kevin McHale (wheelchair-bound Artie Abrams in Glee) is the rebellious but gifted new arrival.\nShare article The Green Man (15)\nOriginally screened in 1990 as a BBC Two mini-series and based on Kingsley Amis's 1969 novel of the same name, The Green Man stars Albert Finney stars as a roguish hotel owner who's as fond of women and he is booze. He also enjoys a ghost story or two – the shade of a 17th century occultist is supposed to haunt his Green Man Inn – though when events take a turn for the supernatural, the stories don't seem quite so funny.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-04T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:15:17.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
