The Tamil version of the movie might swoop into 350 more theatres worldwide on October 16th. Rudhramadevi (3D) (U/A): Book Your Tickets Right Away! \nGiven Anushka's popularity in Tamil Nadu, the film is expected to collect big in its first weekend. Having collected more than 25 Crore rupees in the first 3 days from its Telugu version (share alone), the film is sure to give a tough competition to straight Tamil movies when it releases here. \nIlayathalapathy Vijay 's Puli too might face a stiff challenge from Rudhramadevi this weekend. Puli is still running in many theatres in the state, but that might change once the Anushka starrer gets released. \nHaving collected close to 75 Crores from its first week, Puli has ventured into its second week. Come October 16th and the Vijay starrer would've entered its third weekend. \nSince the movie is yet to gather 118 Crores ( Puli 's budget) there will be some pressure on the fantasy flick as it enters its third weekend with Rudhramadevi for company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:09:34.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
