But it died a short time later.\nLocal resident Anna Iker snapped a photo of the snake while watching her kids play in the water, CBS Los Angeles reported . It's one of two seen in the area this week.\n\"I was really shocked because we don't even see land snakes around our neighborhood,\" Iker said.\nThe black-and-yellow snake, which is common south of the border, may have been drawn north by warmer ocean temperatures attributed to the El Nino condition.\nExperts say it's highly venomous, but it is unlikely to attack unless grabbed or otherwise molested.\nThe Los Angeles Times says the body was sent to the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, where it was examined Saturday and samples were taken for DNA analysis.", "external_links": ["http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/3308017-el-nino-blamed-for-poisonous-sea-snakes-in-local-waters/", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/anvload.html?key=eyJtIjoiY2JzIiwicCI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJ2IjoiMzMwODAxNyIsInBsdWdpbnMiOnsiaGVhcnRiZWF0Ijp7ImFjY291bnQiOiJjYnNsb2NhbC1nbG9iYWwtdW5pZmllZCxjYnNsb2NhbC1zdGF0aW9uLWxvc2FuZ2VsZXMtbG9zYW5nZWxlcy11LGNic2xvY2FsLXN1YnByaW1hcnktc3d0di11bmlmaWVkLGNic2xvY2FsLW1hcmtldC1sb3NhbmdlbGVzLXVuaWZpZWQiLCJwdWJsaXNoZXJJZCI6ImNic2xvY2FsIiwiam9iSWQiOiJzY192YSIsIm1hcmtldGluZ0Nsb3VkSWQiOiI4MjNCQTAzMzU1Njc0OTdGN0YwMDAxMDFAQWRvYmVPcmciLCJ0cmFja2luZ1NlcnZlciI6ImhlYXJ0YmVhdHMub210cmRjLm5ldCIsImN1c3RvbVRyYWNr", "http://lat.ms/1Xc9IMu"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:00:39.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
