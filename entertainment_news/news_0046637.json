USA Network has pulled the plug on the action drama that stars Aaron Tveit and Daniel Sunjata among others. Created by Jeff Eastin and debuted as a summer series in 2013, \"Graceland\" delves into the lives of an elusive group of undercover agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and US Customs, who live and operate under one roof. USA Network has not released an official statement over the cancellation but sources told EW that the ratings was the final strings. \"Creatively, it was a great show that had a successful run for three seasons, but the ratings didn't justify bringing it back from a financial perspective,\" a source close to the network told EW. The finale, aired on September 17, drew 913,000 viewers and a 0.33 rating in the adults 18-49 demo. Eastin actually kept his hope high for another season, telling THR last month, \"Our numbers keep creeping up; I'm very happy about that.\" On Thursday afternoon, Eastin took to Twitter to thank fans, writing \"Just got the word, there will be no more #GracelandTV. Thank you to the best cast, crew and fans in television.\" Tveit tweeted, \"I send my love and enormous gratitude to my cast, crew, creators, @FOXTV, @USA_Network! Had the time of my life!!!\" adding \"and extra love and thanks to the greatest fans ever!!\" Erik Valdez, who plays Carlito Solano, tweeted, \"Thanks to @jeffeastin for taking a chance on me and being so supportive along the way...\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:36:52.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
