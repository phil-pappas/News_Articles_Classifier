Seriously, the show came back less than a month ago. I'm guessing I Am Cait screwed things up a little for the franchise, in terms of scheduling, but what is E! even doing if it's not providing us with new Kardashians episodes every week, all year round. YOU GUYS HAVE ONE JOB. But set your grief aside, and let's get on to last night's episode.\n Cait of the Union: If there's one thing this micro-season of KUWTK has accomplished, it's answering my \"Wait, where are the Kardashian girls during I Am Cait ?\" questions by showing us more of what they were going through in the early months of Cait's public transition. Khloé is still furious at Caitlyn for \"bashing\" Kris in the media and then not apologizing. And as much as Khloé's my (usual) favorite, it's really hard to hear her say, \"It's not a real relationship anymore,\" about Caitlyn, whom she still hasn't met.\nMore from Keeping Up With the Kardashians Recaps 20 articles \"KUWTK\" Recap: Khloé Takes a Sad Call From Lamar...

At any rate, they do meet, and we see a bit more of Khloé and Caitlyn's conversation than we did on I Am Cait . What's fascinating is that their argument about Caitlyn's comments in the press boils down to Caitlyn saying, \"I'm telling the truth,\" and the rest of the Kardashians saying, \"That's not actually what we do.\" I'm not accusing the rest of the Kardashians of being liars, but their typical media policy means they're not always frank and forthcoming about feelings. Or anything else. They're very polished that way. Their interaction wrapped up the same way it did on I Am Cait : with Khloé promising Caitlyn that all these communications could be solved by Cait learning how to group text. Here's hoping.\nNot-So-Great Scott: This might just be the last we see from Scott Disick on KUWTK , although that's practically unimaginable. (Of course, I typed that sentence before watching the \"Next season on…\" trailer, which promises a showdown between all three Kardashian sisters, Kris, and Scott, because of course it does.) I do believe, for the record, that Kourtney and Scott's current breakup is for real and for good, but that doesn't mean he'll be 100 percent out of the Kardashian family picture forever. Scott takes Kourtney out on a nightclub appearance that goes surprisingly well, but it's a red herring; soon, he's back in Vegas, and you can tell shit's about to get real because the footage is out of focus and Scott is smoking.\nAlso, at one point during all the drama, Kim gravely informs Kourtney that she no longer wants Scott to be in Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. \"I just don't feel like I want [his] energy in the game.\" AT LEAST WE'RE FINALLY DISCUSSING THE REAL ISSUES.\nAfter Scott disappears to France, it's clear it's over. That's not much of a surprise to viewers, who've known since July that the relationship was finished. And frankly, we don't learn much more about how the breakup went down than we've been able to glean from the Kardashians' veiled statements and social media posts since. Kourtney continues to be a pretty closed book, although watching Kris lose her mind when Cousin CiCi calls to tell her about the leaked photos of Scott with Chloe Bartoli gives us plenty of emotions to work with. (It's also interesting that KUWTK would allow CiCi to do most of the ranting on their behalves, rather than doing it themselves.) Also, we get to see Kourtney assert that interventionists are basically like bounty hunters, which is … something.\nBut there's one more unguarded moment, where Kourtney actually breaks down and cries, which long-term viewers of KUWTK know is a huge deal — normally when she's sad, she awkwardly laughs. The show follows it with clips of Kourtney and Scott through the years. I'm a sucker for those two, and I freely admit that, but I totally cried.\nKylie's Big Day and Kris's New Dude: In the midst of all of this, Kylie's finally moving into her house — she follows the interior designer through the house wearing a sparkly mini-backpack, which makes her seem even more like an actual child making grown-up decisions. Kris brings her boyfriend Corey by to hang out, which is awkward, but not as awkward as a few minutes later, when Kris announces to her children that she's \"probably having too much sex.\" And it all gets even more awkward still when Khloé and Malika sit Corey down to, like, encourage him to share what his intentions with Kris. Seriously, I want Kris to be happy, and I am not here for the way our society tries to desexualize older women — so do you, Kris Jenner.\nStars: They're Not Just Like Us: \"Not your type of person.
