He envisions a future where no one goes hungry, where land ownership is fair, and where growers' traditional crops become prized foodstuffs for nations of gastronomes.\nHe lays out the reasons — and the mechanics — to accomplish those things in \"Food & Freedom: How the Slow Food Movement is Changing the World\" (Rizzoli Ex Libris, $24.95), recently published in John Irving's English translation of Petrini's 2013 book, \"Cibo e Liberta.\"\nPetrini is also the author of \"Slow Food Nation,\" and if you've read his previous book, you'll be familiar with many of principles that Petrini discusses here. \"Good, Clean and Fair,\" for example, is the Slow Food rallying cry — it is Petrini's idea that food should taste good (leading to gastronomical pleasure); it should be clean (free from pesticides and pollutants, thus sustainable); and it should be fair (priced in such a way that its growers can make a living wage, thus free from exploitation).\nWhat you'll learn here, however, is that Petrini and his associates originally dismissed \"good, clean and fair\" as \"banal.\" Still, says Petrini, the phrase stuck, and now the slogan \"has traveled around the world in different languages. You can hear it at U.S. farmers markets; it stood out on a huge banner ... to welcome me to an elementary school in Kenya; I have seen it in Japanese and Korean ideograms ...\" and now, he says, \"Thanks to the immediacy that we ... had mistaken for banality, the title has evidently hit the mark.\"\nIn the first quarter of the book, \"Liberated Gastronomy,\" Petrini lays out the essential logic and history of Slow Food's beginnings. He explains how he and his group of self-described gastronomes began with wine appreciation and moved into a deeper understanding of how terroir affects food (including wine) and flavor. It is not a long leap, he notes, from appreciation to what he calls \"eco-gastronomy\" — an awareness that tainted soil will never have terrific terroir, and that food grown and harvested by exploited workers will never be fair.\nSalone Del Gusto Jacopo Raule / Getty Images An exhibitor shows some cheese from Basilicata on a stand at the Slow Food's Salone del Gusto and Terra 2014, on Oct. 24, 2014 in Turin, Italy.

(Jacopo Raule / Getty Images) The first quarter is both chronological — explaining Slow Food's earliest days — and logical, as Petrini develops the thinking that led to \"good, clean and fair.\" Describing a meal at a restaurant oddly named The Slow Food Hotel in Lare, \"situated in the Njoro district near the mountain forest of Mau\" in East Africa, he celebrates the drought-tolerant Lare pumpkin, a staple food of the people of the region. Petrini notes that the pumpkin is \"threatened by other more productive, non-native varieties,\" but says that because it can be processed into preserves, flour and juices as well as eaten as both fruit and leaves, the pumpkin \"ensures relative food self-sufficiency in critical periods\" like the monthslong drought he saw when he visited.\nThat meal of pumpkin-based sauces and stews, chapatis made with pumpkin flour, and more, from porridges to desserts, helped Petrini realize that \"the finest recipes of our own regional traditions have the same characteristics: the common memory of hunger past and the knack of women for making a lot with a little.\"\nNew translation Rizzoli In \"Food & Freedom,\" Slow Food founder Carlo Petrini argues for food cleanly produced (without pesticides or pollutants), that tastes good (leading to gastronomical pleasure) and is fairly priced (so that growers can make a living). In \"Food & Freedom,\" Slow Food founder Carlo Petrini argues for food cleanly produced (without pesticides or pollutants), that tastes good (leading to gastronomical pleasure) and is fairly priced (so that growers can make a living). (Rizzoli) This is the kind of understanding that Petrini calls \"liberation gastronomy.\" He uses the phrase to convey the idea that understanding a traditional food's place in its region can lead an appreciative eater to take a deeper interest in that region's social justice issues, its politics, its economics and its culture. It is an important idea, and it is at the root of his assertion that Slow Food is \"changing the world through gastronomy.\"\nThrough most of the remainder of the book, Petrini uses case studies from his global travels to illustrate other points, examining various issues through the lenses of his visits to other Slow Food centers. In Istanbul and New Orleans, in Haiti and Uganda, Petrini sees ways that Slow Food is working to improve the lives of people around the world.\nIt is an inspiring vision. Change, Petrini implies, will never come from the top down. Lives will only improve with change from the ground — literally — up.\nThis isn't an easy — or a fast — read. John Irving's translation is accurate but occasionally (and necessarily) a little clunky: Americans don't speak about \"valorizing\" a thing, for example, but it is a valuable concept to come to understand.\nBut for anyone who has a passion for food, it's an important book. Read it slowly, in appreciative nibbles, rather than gobbling it down like a fast-food meal during a time-crunched lunch break. Be a gastronome, and appreciate it as you read it and later, in its recollection.\nRobin Mather is a senior associate editor at Mother Earth News magazine, and the author of \"The Feast Nearby,\" a collection of essays and recipes about eating locally on a limited budget.\nPrivacy Policy Dining and Drinking Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561aeafc/turbine/ct-carlo-petrini-book-cover-jpg-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561aeb0b/turbine/ct-carlo-petrini-book02-jpg-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ae9cc/turbine/ct-carlo-petrini-book-food-1014-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:16:35.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
