You never know what kind of drama some terrible man is going to throw you way â€” the news that he's been embezzling money from his company, for example, or the revelation that he's been sleeping with your coworker. Some fictional women react to these situations with a mixture of strength and ferocity, like Cookie Lyon on Empire or Mellie Grant on Scandal. Others, however, are just evil. Below, a list of some of the meanest women to ever grace the small screen. Hide your kids, hide your boyfriends, and hide your fear (because they can definitely smell it).\n 1. Georgina Sparks, Gossip Girl\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail The CW More From Cosmopolitan Here is a brief list of just some of the things Georgina, who only appeared on a handful of episodes each season, did on Gossip Girl . (1) Sold her show pony for cocaine money. (2) Impersonated a woman named Sarah so she could seduce Dan. (3) Blackmailed Serena into thinking she killed a guy. (4) Pretended her baby belonged to Dan when it did not. (5) Abandoned said baby. (6) Told everybody about Rufus and Lily's long-lost love child. If you live on the Upper East Side and have not been blackmailed by Georgina Sparks, then you may as well move to Brooklyn because you are definitely a nobody.\n2. Cersei Lannister, Game of Thrones\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail HBO Cersei's evil tendencies were established in the pilot episode when she asked her twin brother (also her lover) to push a small child out a window, and it's only gotten worse from there. She finally got her comeuppance last season when the High Sparrow made her walk through King's Landing naked while a mean septa yelled \"shame\" 800 times, but you know she'll be back. A Lannister always pay her debts!\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail 3. Chanel Oberlin, Scream Queens\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Fox via Getty Images Sure the show has only been on for two weeks, but Chanel is already on her way to becoming a legendary TV bitch. She shoved her maid's head in a deep fryer, for god's sake. Even if it was an accident like she claimed, that insane tirade about how she likes her pumpkin spice lattes definitely proved that she's evil at heart.\n4.
