So she went out and got a six-foot-tall metal rooster she named Beyonc√©, placed it in front of the door of her Texas home, and rang the bell. Knock-knock. \nIn her blog, \"The Bloggess,\" Lawson gives readers the best kind of roller-coaster, laugh-till-you-cry ridiculousness at times, but she can be scarily vulnerable at others, particularly when she writes about her anxiety disorders, depression, and habit of cutting herself. \nIn Furiously Happy , the follow-up to her best-selling Let's Pretend This Never Happened , Lawson tries to fall more deeply into those dark places. The title comes from a blog post in which she decides to be \"furiously happy\" as a response to her depression. \nLawson's writing is almost desperate in its attempts to make the reader laugh. And she seems reluctant to open the door and let us in to her \"horrible things.\" Maybe she wants to keep readers at a distance, worried we'll all fall into her pit of despair if we look too deeply. \nHer descriptions of helping people with mental illness miss one very, very large truth: Most people who fight battles such as hers do not have weapons or safety nets like hers. Singer Amanda Palmer is not going to create a hidden balcony for me at her concert, as she did for Lawson. And most partners cannot or will not drop everything and fly to hotel rooms for panic-attack blanket huddles. Lawson can reach out at 2 a.m. to her Twitter tribe for help, but what most sufferers of depression get is the sound of silence. \nThe chapter that reads truest is Lawson's \"interview\" with Victor, in which he pretends to ask her questions she thinks will come up in interviews. She tries to explain how depression works in her body and mind, and what doesn't work when she is depressed. Instead of forcing the funny, it comes naturally, even when talking about horrible things. \nFuriously Happy will be familiar territory to Lawson's faithful. I wish it were vulnerable in the same way as Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half , that landmark illustration of depression that started conversations in many households. \nStill, Lawson has her moments, and for those, this book is worth it. The world needs a third book from her, one that will let her dive deeper into her own issues while making us feel better about our own. \nDawn Fallik is a former Inquirer staff writer and an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Delaware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:02:34.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
