Pictures \nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — It was appropriate that a recent interview with Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton to discuss portraying hard-hitting political consultants in “Our Brand Is Crisis” (opening Friday) took place on a late Sunday morning. At that moment, millions of Americans likely had just been watching the Sunday talk shows that focus on the state of politics in this country and around the world. \nHowever, Bullock — who not only stars in the movie, but produced it as well — pointed out, “What we showed in the film is happening now for real — the backstabbing, the political chicanery and the rest. It happens every day, but not just in America, and not just in politics. \n“Every big business has its spin doctors, attorneys and manipulators, including the dark ones they never talk about who go in, fix and destroy things and then clean up the mess afterward. It’s everywhere. Wherever there’s money and power involved, you have levels of this happening.” \nIn “Crisis,” Bullock portrays Jane Bodine, a brilliant yet deeply flawed woman who has achieved great success in managing political campaigns — but also suffered spectacular defeats. Thornton plays Pat Candy, Bodine’s longtime nemesis who in the film is again her opponent as the two of them are backing opposing candidates in a fictious Bolivian presidential election. \nThornton noted that he sees a strong connection between political consultants and the world of Hollywood. While consultants often have to “play pretend like actors,” Thornton said that “the people we play in this film — the behind-the-scenes people — are really more like the producers or directors or studio executives who really run things in Hollywood.” \nAsked if making this film made her look at politics any differently, Bullock observed, “We knew it was like this before we made the film. That’s the sad part. This was evident to us years ago. \n“Once you see behind the curtain, so to speak, you can’t ‘un-see’ it. Our goal here was to create a fun commentary on the absurdity of it. After all, it is the theater of the absurd.” \nThe use of consultants to manipulate political outcomes, she said, is a global effort. “The win is all-important in every country. That’s kind of sad, because it’s often about winning at all costs. It doesn’t matter what culture it decimates. It doesn’t matter which people it harms. It’s all about the win. Period.” \nIn the film, Anthony Mackie plays Ben, the chief political consultant hired by the establishment candidate in Bolivia, who takes the chance to hire Bullock’s Bodine character as his strategist to help win what initially appears to be an unwinnable campaign. \nThe actor said he reached out to real-life political types for advice before he tackled the role. \n“I talked to [James] Carville a little bit. I talked to a good friend of mine who is a senator, plus another good friend who is a congressman — just to get their take on it.” \nFor Mackie, politics today is difficult — but for all the wrong reasons. \n“Look, everybody has a closet full of skeletons — some more scary than others,” said the actor with a smile. “Now, as a politician you agree to expose your skeletons — especially in this day and age. \n“Not that long ago, before we had social media and 24/7 news cycles, and so much investigation into the personal lives of people in public life, personal issues didn’t really matter. In those days, the president could be a complete louse, but we voted for him because he got us new highways in St. Louis or Chicago. But now, you have to be a golden boy, you have to be Christian. You have to be nice in order to get elected. \n“Instead, I wish we could have politicians today who stand up for what they believe in and articulate that to us, instead of us worrying about what you do Friday to Sunday on your personal time.” \nLike many people, Mackie is distressed by the degree of negative campaigning. “Instead of discussing the really important issues about education or crime or national defense issues, they’re more concerned with taking out the razor blade and chopping a piece of dirt off of their opponent’s past.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:20:14.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
