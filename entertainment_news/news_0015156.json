With a slightly different twist, and a location tucked away in the heart of the city, the event is set to be unforgettable. In a beautiful outdoor setting, you can expectdelicious food, chai and coffee stalls as well as a great performance byParvaaz, inspiring speakers and performances by the children from our NGO partners. Throughout, there will be an AIESEC activism wall, a late night storytelling session and secret movie screenings, acoustic circles and more activities planned all night. \nThis year, we have partnered with 4 NGO’s who all run homes for the homeless and destitute: The Baale Mane Trust, Adarane Trust, Rainbow Homes, and The New Ark Mission (or Home of Hope). All of these NGOs work to prevent homelessness in Bangalore by giving homes and a brighter future to boys and girls, the mentally and physically disabled and the elderly. 100% of the funds we make through ticket sales will be split equally between our 4 NGO partners. \n“Under the Stars is a great chance for NGOs, organisations and individuals to come together for one evening with a common cause. It is also a completely unique concept in India, and so gives people the chance to try something different.” said Emily Parkes, External Relations Manager of The Baale Mane Trust. \nThe organising partners of this year’s edition are The Baale Mane Trust, The India Cares Foundation, RECAL NIT Trichy Alumni Association and a number of dedicated individuals. As Devi, an organising volunteer from the Association for India’s Development believes: “ Your one night under the stars can make a real difference to someone who has to sleep out every night.” \nWe have collaborated with a number of organisations to bring you the best Under the Stars event yet, and the fun won’t stop all night long! So, be involved and bring in DaanUtsav (Joy of Giving Week) in style and with only a blanket, pillow and mat and the company of some friends and spend one night out the in the open, under the stars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:50:46.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
