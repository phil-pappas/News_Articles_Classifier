Peter Pan re-imagined on the streets of L.A. #indiefilms, #TVpilots http://bit.ly/1LmcwBk\nNEW YORK , Oct. 22, Stonestreet Studios ( www.stonestreet.net ) co-founders/owners, Alyssa R. Bennett and Gary O. Bennett , today announced the up-coming release of Fountain & Never , an original short-form web series written and directed by Antonio Macia and produced by Stonestreet Studios.\nFountain & Never ( http://on.fb.me/1MGQUCR ) re-imagines JM Barrie's Peter Pan as an urban street tale and follows the lives of six foster kids who have aged out of the system, left to struggle on the unforgiving streets of Los Angeles .\nThe first nine episodes of Fountain & Never will have its premiere screening for an invited audience on November 10 th in New York City at Stonestreet Studios.\nDirector/Writer Antonio Macia ( Holy Rollers, Affluenza, Anne B. Real ) filmed Fountain & Never over the span of 14 days using natural light and explored the gritty realism of inner city Los Angeles locations.\n\"In creating Fountain & Never, I wanted to highlight the challenge kids in the foster care children face as they age out of the system. Many of them turn 18 and are forced to face the world alone. They are ill-equipped to survive,\" said Mr. Macia.\nMacia is an alumnus of the Stonestreet Studios Conservatory for Screen Acting & Production associated with New York University . He looked to current Stonestreet Studios' actors to find his 'Peter Pan' cast of lost boys and girls.\n\" Antonio Macia has molded an amazing ensemble of millennial actors whose performances linger long after each episode concludes,\" said co-producer Gary O. Bennett .\"\nMacia explained he was drawn to a short-form web series because, \"It allows me as a storyteller to condense and heighten the drama, yet still create fully formed characters and plot lines.\"\nFilm and TV industry professionals interested in attending the November 10 th premiere should contact Stonestreet Studios via admin@stonestreet.net or ( 212) 229-0020.\nView the trailer here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd6gjf0RaW0&feature=youtu.be\nABOUT Stonestreet Studios\nStonestreet Studios ( www.stonestreet.net ) is celebrating 24 years as a New York City based, fully operative, multi-purpose, visual production studio, founded by wife and husband, award-winning producer, writer and director team Alyssa Rallo Bennett and Gary O.
