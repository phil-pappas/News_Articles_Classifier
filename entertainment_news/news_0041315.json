Bablu Patel alias Jani Mia, 25, a native of Kalburagi in Karnataka, died on the spot while the injured, Mr Mahesh and Mr Balaraju, were rushed to Osmania General Hospital by locals and the police. The attacker Md Arbaz, 22, an autorickshaw driver from Syednagar, is allegedly addicted to marijuana and whitener, said sources. Police suspects that he is mentally ill. “There are no strong motives for the attack. We are verifying if he was having psychological issues,” said Banjara Hills ACP Uday Kumar Reddy. The incident took place on a street in NBT Nagar. \"The man was carrying a knife and he attacked Bablu from the side. He stabbed him multiple times on his stomach and upper body,\" a witness told the police. The second victim, Mr Mahesh, a mentally challenged person living in the area, was answering nature’s call when he was attacked. \"He attacked him from the behind. However, he escaped before he could stab him again,\" said the ACP. Arbaz also injured one Mr Balaraju, who was walking along the road, when he swiped his knife at him. He then tried to stab two more people who had come out of nearby shops. However, they escaped without any injuries. Police said when people start gathering, Arbaz ran away. Investigation officials are also verifying if he has any criminal records. A team of Commissioner’s task force police arrested the accused Arbaz from Banjara Hills.
