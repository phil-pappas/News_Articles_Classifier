The agony of da feet is immortalized in a brand new exhibit.\nThe Museum of the City of New York celebrates the New York City Marathon just days ahead of its Nov. 1 running with a first-of-its-kind exhibition exploring the 45-year history of the world-famous road race.\n“The New York Marathon: The Great Race” opens on Tuesday with 120 spectator photographs, historic video footage of famous finishes, as well as key profiles and milestones in the event’s long and winding history. The curators have pulled 26 fun facts, one for each of the marathon’s 26.2 miles, that will inspire you to hit the road.\ncourtesy Museum of the City of New York Runners pass the marathon halfway point at the Pulaski Bridge, as seen in this photo from the City Museum of New York's \"The New York Marathon: The Great Race\" exhibit. 1. The first New York City Marathon in 1970 featured just 127 entrants running four laps around Central Park. This year’s race boasts more than 50,000 runners rounding the five boroughs - making it the most populous marathon in the world.\n2. Only 55 men finished the first NYC Marathon, and the sole female dropped out due to illness. But the 2014 race saw more than 20,000 sole sisters crossing the finish line, and some 30,000 men.\n3. The first-ever winners scored inexpensive watches and recycled baseball/bowling trophies. That’s a far cry from this year’s $100,000 first place prizes, along with time bonuses of up to $50,000, depending on how fast the elites finish.\ncourtesy Museum of the City of New York Marathoners ran through 2.3 million paper cups dispensing more than 32,000 gallons of Gatorade last year. 4. Women were barred from running marathons until the Amateur Athletic Union (the one-time governing body of distance running) finally lifted the ban in 1971 - provided they started either 10 minutes before or after the men. So in 1972, the six female New York City Marathon runners waited for the starting gun to signal their 10-minute head start - but once the gun went off, they sat down in protest against the discriminatory policy, and started with everyone else.\n5. The first five NYC Marathons were held entirely in Central Park. But New Yorker George Spitz dreamed of re-routing the marathon through the city’s streets to celebrate the 1976 U.S. Bicentennial. It was such a huge success that the marathon has been a five-borough race ever since.\n6. The youngest person to ever complete the marathon was 8-year-old Wesley Paul from Columbia, Missouri in 1977, who finished in a blistering 3:00:37. Several kids actually ran in the first few years of the race, but a mandatory age minimum of 16 was set in 1981, and later raised to 18.\ncourtesy Museum of the City of New York Mile 14 of the marathon in Long Island City. 7. Along with a cannon blast, Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” is always played over the loudspeakers to signal the start of the marathon.\n8. Runners face their longest and steepest incline of the race right at the start. The Verrazano Bridge slopes upward 136 feet in the first 3/4 of a mile.\n9. Approximately 26 tons of clothing are discarded by runners within the first few miles. The clothes are collected by volunteers and donated to Goodwill.\ncourtesy Museum of the City of New York The Brooklyn leg of the marathon is the flattest and the fastest. courtesy Museum of the City of New York The Brooklyn leg of the marathon is the flattest and the fastest.

The Bishop Loughlin High School band plays the “Rocky” theme song “Gonna Fly Now” over and over again at Mile 9 until the last runner goes by. They’ve done this each year since 1979.\n12. Volunteers handed out 2.3 million paper cups to runners, dispensing more than 62,000 gallons of water and 32,000 gallons of Gatorade last year alone.\nDavid Handschuh/ASSOCIATED PRESS Norwegian schoolteacher Grete Waitz won the New York City Marathon a whopping nine times. 13. Crossing the Pulaski Bridge marks the halfway point in the Marathon at 13.1 miles. After this, the average pace slows from 8:24 minutes per mile to 9:14.\n14. The steep Queensboro Bridge around miles 15-16 is considered one of the toughest points in the course. And with no spectators allowed on the bridge, it is also the quietest.\n15. In addition to runners from the USA (59% of participants), the 2014 marathon saw finishers from 136 different countries, from Albania to Zimbabwe.\nKathy Willens/ASSOCIATED PRESS Meb Keflezighi became the first American to win the New York City Marathon in 27 years in 2009. 16. The top 50 fastest men’s marathon times are held by runners from Kenya and Ethiopia - with the exception of one American, Ryan Hall, with the 47th fastest time. Of the top 100, Kenyans posted 64 of the fastest times; Ethiopians hold 34, the Moroccans claim 3, and the USA has 2.\n17. The marathon was broadcast live for the first time in 1981 on WABC-TV, and the network continued its coverage until 1993. Then after a nearly 20-year hiatus, ABC/ESPN resumed televising the race in 2013.\n18. Due to the ever-increasing number of entrants, a partial lottery system was launched in 1983. The first 8,000 applications were accepted automatically, and the remainder were entered in a drawing. But by 1996 the marathon instituted a full-lottery application process. New York Road Runners members, charity organizations, and streakers (annual multi-year participants) are generally guaranteed entry.\ncourtesy Museum of the City of New York The Wheelchair and Hand Cycle Division became a formal category of the New York City Marathon in 2000. courtesy Museum of the City of New York/Adrian Kinloch The Wheelchair and Hand Cycle Division became a formal category of the New York City Marathon in 2000.

He was a Vietnam veteran who had lost his legs in battle 17 years earlier. He covered the course using only his arms to propel him, stopping to talk with vets, the homeless, and others who were inspired by his mission to finish the race.\n20. The Wheelchair and Hand Cycle Division became a formal category of the New York City Marathon in 2000. In 2014, 244 athletes with various disabilities, as well as 200 volunteer assistants, participated in the race.\n21 . Norwegian Grete Waitz was the world’s first great female marathoner. She won the New York City Marathon nine times in the 10 years between 1978 and 1988 (more than any runner in history) and set world records in three of those races.\nCraig Ruttle/ASSOCIATED PRESS After the 2012 marathon was canceled in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, hundreds of runners, wearing their marathon shirts and backpacks full of supplies, took the ferry to hard-hit Staten Island and ran to hard-hit neighborhoods to help.

She was spotted her leaving the course after only 10 miles and taking the subway to Columbus Circle before walking to the finish. Ruiz was stripped of her medal and her Boston Marathon medal five months later, where she was also accused of cheating.\n23. New York Road Runners founder and New York City Marathon father Fred Lebow established the Fred’s Friends (now Fred’s Team), the first official charity of the NYC race, after he was diagnosed with brain cancer in 1990. Last year, 8,500 charity runners raised a record $34.5 million for hundreds of charity organizations.\n24. After 27 years, in 2009 Meb Keflezighi became the first American winner of the New York City Marathon since Alberto Salazar’s third win in 1982. Keflezighi is attempting to regain his title at this year’s race on Nov. 1.\n25. The marathon was canceled for the first time in its history in 2012 after Superstorm Sandy ravaged the Tri-State area. Instead, many runners traveled to Staten Island or elsewhere in and around the boroughs to support recovery efforts.\n26. Katherine Singluff from Brooklyn became the one millionth New York City Marathon finisher last year, scoring guaranteed entry into the race for life and a shopping spree for marathon gear.\nAnd a bonus .2 : Marathon founder Fred Lebow succumbed to brain cancer in 1994, just two years after he crossed the finish line of his great race with his dear friend/women’s champion Grete Waitz, who also died of cancer in 2011. A memorial statue of Lebow stands at Central Park’s East Drive and 90th Street - but it’s moved to the marathon finish line at Tavern on the Green each year in the days surrounding the great race. Many runners touch his feet for good luck.\nWarga, Craig The statue of New York Road Runners legend Fred Lebow waits as the marathon finish line is constructed at Tavern on the Green in Central Park. ALEX BRANDON/ASSOCIATED PRESS Marathon founder Fred Lebow (60) and Grete Waitz (F39) finished the 1992 New York City Marathon together, just two years before he passed away.
