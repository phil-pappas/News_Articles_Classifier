FILE PHOTO Related article » MAYOR-GO-ROUND\nDec. 2013 -- Council votes 3-2 to name Alan Long mayor even though then-Mayor Pro Tem Kelly Bennett was in line to serve per the council's traditional rotation system. Councilman Harry Ramos named mayor pro tem.\nMay 2014 -- Bennett resigns from the council in May of 2014. Her seat on the dais is filled by Gene Wunderlich, who is appointed after saying he had no plans to run in the upcoming election.\nOct. 2014 -- Mayor Alan Long steps down as mayor but stays on council following his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence. Councilman Harry Ramos, serving as mayor pro tem, leads meetings for a couple of months.\nNov. 2014 -- Long, Rick Gibbs are re-elected and Jonathan Ingram is selected by voters to fill seat vacated by Wunderlich.\nDec. 2014 -- Council votes 5-0 to name Ramos as mayor and Randon Lane as mayor pro tem. Although he voted for the selections, Councilman Gibbs decries the decision of 2013 to cast aside the rotation system, which he voted against, and says Ramos needs \"seasoning.\"\nOct. 8, 2015 -- Council votes to 4-0 to strip Ramos of his mayoral title after the release of an 81-page report that alleges multiple violations of the city's Code of Conduct.\nOct. 20, 2015 -- Council votes 4-1 to name Randon Lane mayor and Rick Gibbs mayor pro tem.\nThe Murrieta City Council on Tuesday night tabbed Randon Lane, a public affairs manager for the Southern California Gas Company, to serve as mayor until at least the first meeting of December.\nLane, who previously served as mayor in 2011, will be taking the gavel that was stripped from Councilman Harry Ramos, who was removed as mayor on Oct. 8 following the release of an 81-page report that detailed numerous violations of the city’s Code of Conduct.\nThe vote was 4-1 with Ramos dissenting. Rick Gibbs, a council member who has served since 2005, was named mayor pro tem. The council will select a mayor and mayor pro tem for the 2016 calendar year at its first meeting of December, which falls on Dec. 1.\n“I’m torn and troubled by this issue,” Ramos said, reading from a prepared statement ahead of the vote. He went on to criticize the process that led the council to remove him from mayor, calling it a “kangaroo court circus,” and said he will try to secure a writ of mandate that would restore his title.\nThe other members of the council did not deign to address Ramos’ comments, choosing instead to proceed with the nomination process. Gibbs nominated Lane as mayor and himself as mayor pro tem, which was seconded by Councilman Jonathan Ingram.\nRamos, elected in 2012 as a grassroots candidate, is up for re-election in 2016.\nHe has rejected calls from residents to step down from the council before that because he feels he has been unfairly targeted due to his political leanings, which have frequently found him as the lone dissenting vote in 4-1 decisions.\nThe investigation into Ramos’ actions as mayor was launched after former councilman Doug McAllister and a coalition of residents used the public comments portion of a meeting to air a long list of alleged breaches of the city’s Code of Conduct.\nDuring the investigation, a former employee for a Temecula radio station was contacted about Ramos’ actions at a Chamber of Commerce mixer in January.\nThat woman would eventually file a lawsuit against Ramos and the city, claiming Ramos sexually harassed her after the event.\nAt the Oct. 8 meeting, the council also cut off Ramos’ funding for travel outside of the city and removed him from regional commissions and boards, ending his tenure as a representative of the city.\nContact the writer: aclaverie@pe.com , 951-368-9698, @PE_Claverie", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwl1y2-b88546281z.120151021112515000g14cn8eg.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwl1y2-b88546281z.120151021112515000g14cn8eg.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:18:37.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
