Chopra was the 2000 Miss World winner. \nThe error was noted online by viewers, and ABC responded with an apology and posted a corrected version of the \"Nightline\" story online. \nChopra, a Bollywood star who plays an FBI recruit in \"Quantico,\" responded to the mix-up on Twitter by posting \"LOL\" and linking to another post that read, \"Uh oh, @Nightline!\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:17:46.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
