Myrna was born in Harlem, New York one beautiful day in August. Her ambition was to be a “kept woman.” She obtained her goal, but it only lasted ten years. Several interruptions occurred, but despite her setbacks, Myrna climbed the corporate ladder with a high school diploma and has traveled many roads in life. Here is her story—the life of a self-made star.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “And All the Time I Loved God” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
