( Paul Aiken / Staff Photographer ) \nPairing cheat sheet \n• Chicken & herbs: India Pale Ale \n• Seafood: Witbier \nAs the craft beer scene continues to grow, so does the need for breweries and brewpubs to offer high-quality, appropriately paired eats and sweets to enjoy while folks consume their favorite craft ales and lagers. \nFortunately for craft beer aficionados, Boulder County is not lacking available options. \nClark is a man of many hats. He is brewmaster and head chef, he founded the brewpub, coordinates events and even maintains his own backyard beehives. \nHis multifaceted story starts early. \nWhen he was 14, years before he fell in love with beer, Clark first fell for food. The Maine native attended the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt., and spent time in various kitchens across the country before moving to Boulder, where he was bit by the homebrewing bug. \nBecause of is cooking background, Clark was fascinated by beer's ability to be tweaked and altered to match particular flavor profiles — he was hooked. Before long, his production was far outweighing his consumption. \n\"The hobby had sort of taken over my basement and garage,\" Clark explains, looking back and laughing. \"I would have just hundreds of gallons of things fermenting and all sorts of experimental stuff. My wife was getting kind of mad at me ... my hobby was sort of taking over our house.\" \nWhen Clark first considered opening BRU, he had been an active homebrewer for nearly a decade. Wanting to bring his passion for quality food and beer together under one roof, Clark opened BRU Handbuilt Ales & Eats in February 2013. BRU's crispy pork bahnmi comes with cilantro, lime aioli, pickled cucumber and \"BRU\"ster sauce. BRU's Extra Special Bitter might pair well with this sandwich.

Pairings can contrast or complement different flavors and even cleanse the palate. \nAs far as the comparison between pairing meals with wine or beer, Clark believes there is no question: Beer pairs better than wine does. \n\"I find beer to be a much more malleable and complex beverage... the brewer has the ability to sort of build beer and make it as complex or simple as they want,\" Clark said. \"If we have a complex beer, we obviously want to have a complex dish along with it to match intensity with intensity.\" \nSome beer lovers find sours simply revolting and others are bored by pilsners. In the same sense, there is no universal right answer for how to pair beer with food; it all depends on a consumer's palate and what he or she is trying to get out of the pairing. \nAs far as Clark's personal preferences, he asserts that you can't go wrong pairing BRU's cheddar and corn fritters with its Extra Special Bitter or one of the brewery's IPAs. \nI am quite partial to BRU's tomato, basil and mozzarella sourdough pizza, matched with a Citrum IPA. The brew's lemon zest and juniper complement the rich and slightly acidic notes of the pie. \nPairing beer and food doesn't have to be as complex as matching a bourbon barrel-aged tripel with butterscotch budino — although it's amazing. It's all about what you're looking for. Pairing beer can be as simple as matching a burger with a brown ale. \nEvery month, Clark and his BRU crew hold dinners that gather beer lovers, foodies and everyone in between. Their next dinner is scheduled for 7 p.m. Nov. 11. Tickets are available at BRU. An India Pale Ale would be a good choice to accompany BRU's crispy fried chicken with red-chile honey, buttermilk biscuits and pickled collard greens.
