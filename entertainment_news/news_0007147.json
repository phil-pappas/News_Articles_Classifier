The green fairy can be seen popping up in bars and restaurants in Detroit this season.\nOne reason for the piqued interest in the spirit, which was banned in the United States from the early 1900s until 2007, may be because last month Two James Spirits released Absinthe du Nain Rouge. The potent spirit is 120 proof and is available at the distillery’s Corktown tasting room.\n“It’s similar to gin in the sense that it starts out with a spirit that you macerate botanicals in, and we have variety of different botanicals that we put in there including wormwood, which is the famous ingredient that makes absinthe absinthe, at least in the traditional sense,” says Two James distiller Joe Lordon. “Then we re-distill the absinthe and from there we take it and give it a coloration so when it comes off the still it’s basically colorless. The green color happens from the second maceration. From there we proof it down to 120 proof.”\nLordon says the Two James tasting room will serve the Absinthe du Nain Rouge the traditional way, with cold water poured from a fountain over a sugar cube and mint leaf into a glass. Two James Spirits is at 2445 Michigan in Detroit.\nOn Thursday , the Whitney mansion will debut its Absinthe Room as part of the third floor Ghost Bar. The small space is decked out with plush seating, a fireplace and a view of Woodward.

A special Sunday seating 11 a.m.-4 p.m. will be titled Death in the Afternoon in honor of absinthe-lover Ernest Hemingway. The restaurant will serve an absinthe and champagne cocktail and a light brunch.\nThe Whitney is at 4421 Woodward. Call (313) 832-5700 for reservations.\nAt Republic Tavern in the Grand Army of the Republic Building, 1942 Grand River, the fall cocktail menu is home to Mr. Green, a liquorice drink made with St. George Absinthe, Sambuca, Drambuie and lemon. The nose-to-tail restaurant recently launched its fall food menu, too, which is stacked with small plates of comfort foods like roasted carrots, corn fritters with avocado mousse, and apples with butternut squash and roquefort cheese.\nDeliciously brief \n■ Last week Greektown Casino-Hotel debuted its newest attraction, the Rock Bar and Lounge.
