More power to them but I just don't relate!\" \nThe 34-year-old is expecting a son with her husband on Christmas. However, she is doing anything but enjoying the process. Free Sign Up CP Newsletter!

I just always feel like I'm not in my own skin. It's hard to explain,\" she said. \"I don't feel sexy, either â€” I feel insecure and most of the time I just feel gross. People just don't tell you all of the gross things that happen during pregnancy or after.\" (Photo: Reuters/Danny Moloshok) TV personality Kim Kardashian and musician Kanye West arrive at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles, California, August 30, 2015. \n\"Do you know you basically have to wear a diaper for two months afterwards?! LOL! No one told me that! #SoSexy,\" she said. \"But I will say, as much as I really hate the whole feeling of being pregnant, I enjoy the challenge of getting my body back after it's all over. I feel so accomplished when I'm back to where I want to be. ... So for all my complaining, it's 100 percent worth it and more!\" \nKardashian previously spoke about being blessed by God with her second child, despite readying social media comments that accuse her of hiring a surrogate to carry her child. \n\"I'm grateful to God for this miracle and no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way this time they truly don't affect me. First they say I'm too skinny so I have to be faking it. ... Now they say I'm too big so I have to be faking it. ... SMH,\" she tweeted . \"Some days I'm photographed before I eat and look smaller, some days I've just eaten and I look bigger. It's all a part of the process.\" \nAccording to Kardashian West, she would have publicly documented the process of surrogacy if she chose to ask someone else to carry her second child with West into the world. After facing harsh criticism for her weight gain and pregnancy fashion when she was pregnant with her first child, 2-year-old North West, Kardashian West insists she's comfortable in her own skin. \n\"U know me well enough 2know I would document the process if I got a surrogate,\" she previously tweeted. \"Everyone's body is different, every pregnancy is very different. I've learned to love my body at every stage!\" During her first pregnancy with North, Kardashian suffered from a dangerous condition called preeclampsia that results in high blood pressure and possible organ damage. These days, she is grateful to have avoided the condition in her second pregnancy thus far. \n\"I'm blessed to even be pregnant and luckier to not have preeclampsia so far, so I don't have the swelling issue, \" Kardashian West wrote in her series of tweets. \"They also say your body carries a boy different than a girl. Wishing all of the moms out there a happy and healthy pregnancy and delivery! #MiracleFromGod #Blessed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:17:11.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
