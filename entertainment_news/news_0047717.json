The May release of Mystery Glue again features the original line up of Graham, Bob Andrews, Brinsley Schwarz, Martin Belmont, Andrew Bodnar and Stephen Goulding. \nOften cited as a major influence on amongst others Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Paul Weller and Bruce Springsteen, Parkerâ€™s song writing prowess and live intensity is the stuff of legend. Share article \nWhether onstage or in the studio the chemistry and energy between Graham and the Rumour was riveting yet by 1980, after 5 studio albums together and 2 live sets, they split, Graham pursuing a solo career that has seen him record some 25 albums in the years since. \nVisit www.the-brook.com Pioneering punk band to play Hampshire gig Sorry, an error occurred.
