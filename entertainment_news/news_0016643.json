ABC has cut the drama's episode order to 10 for its first season, Deadline reports. The series was originally handed a 13-episode count for the season. Since its premiere, the drama has slipped to a 0.9 rating among adults in the 18-49 demographic, though it faces stiff competition from Sunday Night Football on NBC and The Walking Dead on AMC during the same timeslot. On Blood & Oil , set in the oil fields of North Dakota, a young couple played by Chace Crawford and Rebecca Rittenhouse find themselves pitted against oil tycoon Hap, played by Don Johnson , in his return to prime-time TV. Blood & Oil is the third drama to have a trimmed episode order thus far, with both Fox's Minority Report and NBC's The Player shortened. Blood & Oil airs Sundays at 9/8c on ABC.
