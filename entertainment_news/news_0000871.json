Jared Leto's stern Joker graces the new cover of Empire magazine, giving fans the first head-to-toe look at his \"Suicide Squad\" character in full costume. \nLeto's Joker is suited up in a purple snakeskin trench coat; matching violet cane; blue baggy, drawstring \"Arkham Asylum\" pants; plenty of black ink; and slicked back, green hair. He has no shoes, no shirt, but likely problems galore. \nThis is a far cry from Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's takes on Batman's arch nemesis. \nJared Leto in full costume as his \"Suicide Squad\" character Joker. Courtesy of Empire \nLeto also opened up for the very first time about the physical and mental toll of playing the Clown Prince of Crime. \n\"There was definitely a period of ... detachment,\" Leto said, according to ComicBookMovie.com, about his method acting, which involved staying in character around his costars. \"I took a pretty deep dive. But this was a unique opportunity and I couldn't imagine doing it another way. It was fun, playing those psychological games. But at the same time, it was very painful, like giving birth out of my prick hole.\" Check out Jared Leto's Joker on the cover of Empire! #SuicideSquad pic.twitter.com/z4EzksFAqF â€” SPIN 1038 (@spin1038) October 26, 2015 \nLeto even pranked his castmates, including Jim Parrack, who plays his henchman, Jonny Frost. \n\"I was just thinking that the Joker would probably just say, 'F-- you,' and hang up,\" Leto, who called Parrack with orders to spray paint roses and fill a backpack with nails, said. \nHe also sent Margot Robbie, who plays Harley Quinn, a dead rat and bullets to Will Smith (Deadshot). \"Not a single word exchanged off-camera. He was all in on the Joker,\" Smith said about Leto's commitment to the role in a recent interview. \nLeto also revealed how he breathed new life into the classic villain. \n\"I always get the sense that the Joker may be much older than people think,\" he said. \"It's something different. If you don't break rules, you're not going to strike new ground. I think I'll be cooling down for the rest of my life.\" \nDirected by David Ayer, \"Suicide Squad\" also stars Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, Adam Beach as Slipknot and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. \nThe movie hits theaters on August 5.
