A Glimmer is a being of light. They are what make the world glow. There are Glimmers of love, hope, compassion, joy and truth.\nAgnello is introducing Ignate Knorr, the Glimmer of Respect. This is the second book in the award winning Glimmer series. Ruby Shroo, the Glimmer of Truth, is the first book in the series.\nRuby Shroo was born when a courageous truth was told. Glimmers are born every time a good deed is done and truth told.\nGlimmers have been around since the beginning of time. When the earth was formed, all the love and joy on this beautiful planet produced these little beings of light.\nAgnello explains the book, \"Ignate is a glimmer of respect who loses his glow because the man he surrounds loses respect for everyone. Ruby helps get Ignate's glow back. Friends always help friends and respecting people keeps your Glimmers of Respect glowing bright.\"\nOn The Lamb Productions has won two Mom's Choice Awards for their books.\nWebsite: http://onthelambproductions.com/\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Onthelamb\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/187897744676022/?fref=ts\nMedia Contact:\nOn The Lamb Productions\nRobert Agnello\nEmail\n917-626-1777\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274901\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emmy-award-winning-author-robert-agnello-publishes-new-book-in-the-glimmer-series-300155812.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Onthelamb", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emmy-award-winning-author-robert-agnello-publishes-new-book-in-the-glimmer-series-300155812.html", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/187897744676022/?fref=ts", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151007/274901", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH22193&Transmission_Id=201510080830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH22193&DateId=20151008", "http://onthelambproductions.com/", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291961", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274901"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:35:38.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
