(AP) — A Tampa-based radio host has admitted that he attempted to tamper with ratings by trying to influence the listening habits of a person participating in a Nielsen survey.\nBubba The Love Sponge Clem said during a news conference Tuesday that he was \"humbled and embarrassed\" about the incident.\nIn a statement Monday, Beasley Media said Clem was contacted directly by someone who had a ratings device to measure listening habits. Nielsen calculates ratings by putting listening devices that resemble pagers on people.\nClem, who's been off the air since Sept. 26, returned to his show Tuesday morning. No punishment has been announced, but Beasley said it would require Clem and his staff to undergo ratings compliance training.\nClem provides syndicated programming as an independent contractor to WBRN 98.7 in Tampa.\nArts & Entertainment Bubba The Love Sponge Clem", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:02:51.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
