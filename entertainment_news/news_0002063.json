Submitting for placement into the marathon is a highly competitive endeavor and selection is a sign of highly regarded current presence and future potential as musicians. Foxtrax are honored to participate in an event so cherished by music lovers and look forward to sharing their personal spin on indie rock with the thousands of people who attend this year's events –those in both the audience and fellow marathon bands who are out to have a good time and hear great new music.\nComplete information on the CMJ Music Marathon is yet to be announced but, those looking to ensure attendance at Foxtrax's performance can stay up to date on the marathon through CMJ's official website, as well as get updates through Foxtrax's official Facebook page (Facebook.com/foxtraxband) and Twitter feed (Twitter.com/FoxtraxBand) (@FoxtraxBand). Foxtrax can also be found on Instagram, YouTube, Bancamp, SoundCloud and Amazing Tunes platforms.\nAbout Foxtrax\nIndie rock trio, Foxtrax, comprised of: Jon Stenz (drums), Jared Stenz (bass) and Ben Schneid (vocals/guitar), formed at the beginning of 2015 but, don't let the brief length of their time as a group mislead. It is no direct parallel to the band's work ethic or the reception of their music – on the contrary – public interest in their work and live performances, from media and fans alike, has only grown continuously since day one. Astutely combining an unfettered passion of classic rock with an eclectic songwriting aesthetic that honors the styles of bands like The Strokes, Coldplay, Foster the People and Arcade Fire, Foxtrax are embracing the modern stylization of now, while respecting musical foundations of the past.\nConsistently inspired to create, Foxtrax not only turn to playing music but also make it their mission to connect with and inspire others in all aspects of everyday living. They have channeled this intention through their band's philosophy, “Follow Your Foxtrax,” which is meant to encourage everyone to pursue their own ambitions.\nHaving already played the likes of New York City's Pianos, The Bitter End, the Bowery Electric and now a sold out show at Mercury Lounge, following the release of their debut EP, “The Cabin” (recorded/produced by Reed Black [Karen O, Vampire Weekend, Erin McKeown]), Foxtrax continues to look and move, toward higher ground; constantly exuding a comportment and commitment akin to that of a respected veteran band –which they are hailed as being well on their way to becoming.\nAbout CMJ Music Marathon\nCMJ Music Marathon, now celebrating its 35th anniversary, is one of the world’s most important platforms for the discovery of new music. Throughout one vital week every October, CMJ features live performances in New York City's storied venues as well as exclusive parties and cutting edge conference events.\nFoxtrax Press Contact\nKira Grunenberg\nFoxtraxband@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:59:40.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
