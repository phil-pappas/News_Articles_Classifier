I only wanted to know where to move,\" said Guzman, who claims there was no place to park and that there were other cars in the same area, according to the station.\nGuzman reportedly refused to hand over her driver's license when asked for it several times, prompting the officer to act.\n\"I was just screaming help me, help me, my daughter, I was worried about who was going to pick up my daughter,\" Guzman told CBS Miami.\nBut she was taken to jail.\n\"Spending the night in jail over picking up your kids from school is unimaginable,\" said Guzman.\nGuzman added that it was a humiliating ordeal that she will never forget.\nParents who drop off or pick up their kids from the school say parking is a major problem and that citations are given out on a daily basis to those parking where they should not.\nObservers said Guzman's particular situation could have been handled better by both sides.\n\"He could've told her to get out of the car or simply give her a ticket and leave,\" said Amanda Tarrant, who told the station she watched as Guzman was pulled from the car.\nAlissa Cordero said Guzman could have also helped prevent the escalation.\n\"I understand that parking can get a little crazy but it would have been simple if she would've moved instead of fighting him and making a big deal about it,\" she said.", "external_links": ["http://up.anv.bz/latest/anvload.html?key=eyJtIjoiY2JzIiwicCI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJ2IjoiMzMwNDgwMSIsInBsdWdpbnMiOnsiaGVhcnRiZWF0Ijp7ImFjY291bnQiOiJjYnNsb2NhbC1nbG9iYWwtdW5pZmllZCxjYnNsb2NhbC1zdGF0aW9uLW1pYW1pLW1pYW1pLXVuaWZpZWQsY2JzbG9jYWwtc3VicHJpbWFyeS1zd3R2LXVuaWZpZWQsY2JzbG9jYWwtbWFya2V0LW1pYW1pLXVuaWZpZWQiLCJwdWJsaXNoZXJJZCI6ImNic2xvY2FsIiwiam9iSWQiOiJzY192YSIsIm1hcmtldGluZ0Nsb3VkSWQiOiI4MjNCQTAzMzU1Njc0OTdGN0YwMDAxMDFAQWRvYmVPcmciLCJ0cmFja2luZ1NlcnZlciI6ImhlYXJ0YmVhdHMub210cmRjLm5ldCIsImN1c3RvbVRyYWNraW5nU2VydmVy", "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/10/09/parents-partially-blame-school-parking-for-mothers-arrest/"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:16:42.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
