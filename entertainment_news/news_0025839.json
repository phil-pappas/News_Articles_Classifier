Opening Friday, the film stars Ashley Judd, Patrick Wilson and Whoopi Goldberg. \nBut the Lehigh Valley also figures into Trigiani's formative years. Trigiani was born in Roseto, Northampton County, where her family has deep roots. \n\"I have the most wonderful, warm memories of Roseto,\" Trigiani says. \"I had relatives all up and down Garibaldi Avenue. I loved Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, the school, the people. \n\"It was my dad's birthplace, my grandfather's birthplace. It holds deep meaning for me in that regard, as my memories of my grandfather are very dear to me. He was a very special man, kind and decent, and calm.\" \nThe author's grandfather, machinist-turned-mill owner Michael A. Trigiani, was also something of a closet filmmaker who spent years shooting home movies of both his family and important events in Roseto. \nIn the late '80s, Adriana's grandmother gave her a number of canisters containing her grandfather's 16mm films that had been shot between 1936 and 1960. \nAfter taking the footage to DuArt Labs in New York City to have it restored, Adriana marveled at the beauty and richness of the images. \n\"My grandfather really had an eye,\" Trigiani says. \"He made his own camera mount on the back of a car. His handheld camera work was so steady. He was using a steadicam before it was even invented.\" \nWithout those precious home movies, Trigiani might never have followed her dream — or at least one of her dreams — of becoming a filmmaker. \nIn the early 1990s, Trigiani used her grandfather's footage as a \"narrative ribbon\" in \"Queens of the Big Time,\" a documentary about Our Lady of Mount Carmel's annual Big Time Celebration. That experience influenced \"Big Stone Gap.\" \n\"[My grandfather's footage] gave me a style,\" Trigiani says. \"I took my grandfather's films of real people, and took that concept and used it in Big Stone Gap by casting locals with movie professionals, stars if you will. \n\"I love the mix of real and fictional, of real people and actors. It's delicious and surprising, and for me, authentic.\" \nOn a more practical level, \"Queens of the Big Time\" helped pave the way for \"Big Stone Gap\" by introducing Trigiani to scores of producers and industry insiders. \n\"I had won a prize for the documentary 'Queens of the Big Time' at the Hamptons Film Festival,\" says Trigiani, who lives in Greenwich Village with her lighting designer husband, their daughter, a cat and a dog. \n\"A producer asked me what was next, and I told him 'Big Stone Gap.'\" \nBut getting \"Big Stone Gap\" made wound up taking nearly 20 years. Oddly, even though Trigiani is best known as the author of a series of best-selling books, \"Big Stone Gap\" first took shape as a screenplay. \nTrigiani was living in New York, working as a producer and writer on a number of TV shows when she began to feel the pull of her home in Virginia. \nAfter writing the \"Big Stone Gap\" screenplay, a book agent friend convinced Trigiani to turn it into a novel. \n\"I wanted to start a family and figured I'd try to write a novel because it would keep me at home,\" she says. \"It was an experiment [which] taught me to take a risk. I fell in love with writing books.\" \nAnd readers fell in love with Trigiani. The best-selling \"Big Stone Gap\" became the first in a series of novels that include the blockbuster \"The Shoemaker's Wife\" as well as three additional novels set in Big Stone Gap. \nTrigiani's books are so popular, in fact, that she was dubbed by USA Today as one \"the reigning queens of women's fiction.\" The New York Times called her \"a comedy writer with a heart of gold\" and described her books as \"tiramisu for the soul.\" \nWhat was it about rural Virginia that so inspired Trigiani? \n\"Big Stone Gap has many similarities to Roseto but instead of the Italian roots, it has the Appalachian dynamic, which is rich in Americana, including native American, African American, Scots, Irish,\" says Trigiani, whose family moved to Big Stone Gap when she was 6 to open a clothing store. \n\"I love Big Stone Gap because it was different from what I came from, and I found the history exotic and the storytelling fascinating. Virginia history is the history of our nation, and I'm still interested in it because of my education in the Wise County public school system.\" \nShot entirely on location in Big Stone Gap, the film revolves around Ave Maria Mulligan (Ashley Judd), a self-described spinster who, when she's not making deliveries from her family's pharmacy, keeps chaste company with her longtime beau Theodore (John Benjamin Hickey), and exchanges good-natured barbs with local hunk Jack MacChesney (Patrick Wilson). \nAve Maria has, more or less, resigned herself to a quiet life when she's caught off guard by the unearthing of a family secret, an unexpected marriage proposal and a once-in-a-lifetime visit to Big Stone Gap by movie queen Elizabeth Taylor. \nThe rest of the cast includes Jenna Elfman, Jane Krakowski, Judith Ivey, Anthony LaPaglia, Jasmine Guy, Chris Sarandon and Wilson's wife Dagmara Dominczyk (as Elizabeth Taylor). \nIn retrospect, Trigiani is glad she was forced to wait more than a decade to bring \"Big Stone Gap\" to the screen. \n\"I think everything works out for the best,\" she says. \"In art, what's always interesting is that whatever you create captures the moment, wherever that moment lands. \n\"The movie 'Big Stone Gap' captured the moment we made it. The books, four of them in the series, helped me have a bounty of material when I was on my feet making the movie. I knew where Ave Maria was going emotionally, so in that sense, it helped me.\" \nFinding financing and convincing investors she was the right choice to direct \"Big Stone Gap\" was Trigiani's biggest challenge. \n\"No one else ever asked to direct it, or inquired about directing it,\" she says with a laugh. \"However, it was important for me to direct it, because at long last, I could show the great people I grew up with as the beautiful, bright, amazing, flawed, yearning, complex folks they are — and not the stereotypical one-note portrayals I have seen in the media. \n\"That was important, but as an artist, it's most important to tell a great story.\" \nWhen she began working on the film, she took inspiration from screenwriters who flourished during Hollywood's Golden Age. She re-read the work of Anita Loos (\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\") and Philip Dunne (\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\") and imagined it was the '30s and \"Big Stone Gap\" starred Bette Davis (or Myrna Loy), Gary Cooper and Marie Dressler in the roles played by Judd, Wilson and Goldberg, respectively. \nAs much as she'd have liked to work with those Hollywood legends, Trigiani was happy to have directed Judd, who hails from nearby Kentucky, and the Norfolk, Virginia-born Wilson who, in a strange coincidence, had family living in Big Stone Gap. \n\"Patrick's grandmother, Carol Wilson, came to see me when 'Big Stone Gap' was published in 2000 and said Patrick has to play Jack,\" recalls Trigiani. \"Patrick was in his 20s. I told her that I loved his work but he was a little young. She assured me he could do it. \n\"Thirteen years later, she had passed away, cameras rolled and Patrick was 40. He had aged into the role and he plays Jack brilliantly. Ashley was always in my mind for Ave Maria. I went to see her eight years before the cameras rolled. She was a delight and had great ideas. She too, was brilliant, prepared and surprising. Everything she is shows up in her work.\" \nTrigiani says she couldn't have imagined the movie being shot anywhere but Virginia. Going back home to make a movie was one of the most memorable experiences of her life. \n\"It was fantastic. But it was also very nuts-and-bolts. I recognized that every day was a fantastic opportunity and I seized it. I could hardly wait to get to the set every day.\" \nAt the heart of the story is a message of hope. \n\"I want every person that feels stuck in their life, or feels that life has passed them by, or feels hopeless to go to this movie,\" she says. \"You will feel redeemed and feel hope again. This movie will not go VOD for at least a year, on purpose. It is being shown in theaters because we believe that it should be seen in community. It's about community, about locking arms and taking care of one another.\" \nTrigiani learned about the importance of community from an early age. Her parents were part of a close-knit group of Italians living and working in Roseto. \nThe author calls the people of Roseto \"tenants of love, faith and family. The Rosetans are good people, and they have good hearts. I remember how they looked out for one another and supported one another when times were tough. They lived loyalty.\" \nFrom her family, she learned lessons she still uses today. \n\"My moral compass was set by my parents, but my grandparents held it,\" she says. \"Viola Trigiani taught me to fight for what I believed in. She believed in standing up for yourself, for your truth. If someone tried to lie, steal or cheat — and who hasn't had that happen to them? — she'd call them on it. And that included protecting any concepts you had or ideas you had. I can't tell you how that has held me in good stead in Hollywood. \n\"My grandfather died in 1968, so I didn't have him long enough but I remember every word he ever said to me. He taught me three important things that I have never forgotten: how to tie my shoes, how to eat soup properly and how to play checkers. Think about that. One practical thing, one that involves good manners, and one that involves relaxing. That about sums it up.\" \nGrowing up, Trigiani didn't have to look too far for inspiration. Asked to name her biggest influences, she has a long list. \n\"My grandmothers Viola Trigiani and Lucia Bonicelli. My mother Ida Bonicelli Trigiani. My teachers. My librarians. The women I babysat for! Great books. Good movies. Music. The world. I wanted to see everything and do everything.\" \nAs a kid, she imagined she'd move to Manhattan and make a living sleuthing. \"I dreamt always of living in New York City and being 'Harriet the Spy' by Louise Fitzhugh,\" she says. \nWhen she finally told her librarian mom and garment manufacturer dad she wanted to get into the arts, they were less than overjoyed. \n\"My dad told me that there were only three areas that any person should go into: food, clothing or shelter,\" she recalls. \"Now, I look back and I think, 'He's kinda right.' You'll always work if you do food, clothing and shelter.\" \nShe won her folks over by sticking to her guns. \"I just stayed at it,\" she says. \"I'm a middle child and I always thought, 'I only have one life to live and I'm going to do it my way. If it goes belly up, who cares?'\" \nTrigiani was ambitious from an early age. At 15, she went to work as a news reporter for WNVA Radio. \n\"It was the greatest thing ever because I got to write a great deal,\" she says. \"I got superb on-the-job training. I had to write [segments] that were concise. I learned to time my writing to the format. I learned to distill something down to its essence, and all of that is very important in screenwriting. \n\"I also learned how to have a real humane take on the world. Listen to people and their stories and their feelings. Pay attention.\" \nAfter moving to New York she honed her writing skills as a playwright before going to work in television. She wrote 15 pilots for the likes of Jasmine Guy, Raven Symone and Mario Cantone as well as serving as a writer/producer for \"The Cosby Show\" and \"A Different World\" and executive producing \"CityKids\" for ABC/Jim Henson Productions. \nShe also oversaw \"Growing Up Funny,\" a television special for Lifetime that won an Emmy nomination for Lily Tomlin, and wrote a handful of television specials and series featuring Tomlin, Madeline Kahn, Dolly Parton, Whoopi Goldberg, Laraine Newman and Marlo Thomas, among others. \nThe most important lesson the filmmaker learned from her TV work: Always respect and take care of the crew. \nAs busy as Trigiani is, she still gets back to Roseto to visit her extended family and even makes her way to Scranton to check in with the folks of Michael Patrick King, the creative engine behind \"Sex and the City\" and her longtime BFF. (Trigiani's books are tucked throughout the HBO series and resulting movies). \nStill to come from Trigiani are more stories that \"entertain and enchant … and ease your burden.\" \nSays the author, \"I'm working on another novel. And the audience will tell me if they want another movie. I hope they do. I've got one for them.\" \nAmy Longsdorf is a freelance writer. \n610-820-6704 \n'BIG STONE GAP' \n• What: A comedy set and shot in Big Stone Gap, Va., which centers on family secrets and self-discovery.
