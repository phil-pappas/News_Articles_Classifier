They used Toneapi.com to detect and interpret emotions found in text to discover that the 1D idol was the happiest of all.\nToneapi.com technology identifies emotional patterns in tweets such as joy, rage, anger, surprise, trust and annoyance to determine who was the cheeriest celebrity posting opinions, views and comments on Twitter.\nStyles, 21, who looks set to pursue an acting career, was rated No 1, narrowly ahead of the singer songwriter Adele. The study also revealed the Top 50 happiest and most popular celebrities on Twitter are dominated by the music industry (60%), with Justin Bieber , Timberlake, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars all making the Top 50.\nThis contrasts with TV and film stars who represent 26% of the top 50, but features high-ranking celebrities such as chat show stars Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres and movie star Emma Watson .\nSisters Khloe and Kim Kardashian joined Paris Hilton in the Celebrity category (6%), footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney were represented in Sport (4%) and the happiest Leaders (also 4%) were comprised of the Dalai Lama and Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi .\nChris Johnston , CEO at Adoreboard the tech company behind Toneapi.com, said the results could have implications for the way popular brands communicate on social networks such as Twitter.\n\"As part of the research we've identified that those celebrities who express strong emotions like joy or rage on Twitter are more likely to receive retweets or favourites. We found that the strength of the emotion expressed by a celebrity - known as their 'activation levels' - provides a good indicator as to how often they will be engaged with and shared. This insight applies equally to brands who should be conscious that strength of emotion could be an indicator of how likely a marketing message could spread across Twitter.\"\nThe research is part of a campaign aimed at increasing people's awareness of how they communicate emotions in written text ranging from e-mails to press releases. People can log onto Toneapi.com to uncover the level of emotions expressed in any written content.\nGary McKeown , an expert in communication and emotions at the School of Psychology at Queen's said: \"We are emotionally curious beings. This translates to online and broadcast worlds in which we pay attention to celebrities who are, in some ways, virtual social group members that we value. More intense emotions are likely to attract more attention and can prime action tendencies in an observer. In an online setting this would typically mean an increased likelihood of a retweet, a favourite or a Facebook like.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273090-INFO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201510011526&Transmission_Id=201510011143PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201510011526&DateId=20151001", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:54:58.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
