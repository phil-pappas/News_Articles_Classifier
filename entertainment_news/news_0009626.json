Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle from \"The Lego Movie\" are facing off against Lord Vortech, who, to blend into the setting, is sporting a cowboy hat and handlebar mustache. \nThis scenario, which takes place about a third of the way into the \"Lego Dimensions\" story, solidified my love for this game. \nLet's begin with the obvious: If you do not like TT Game's previous \"Lego\" titles, you likely will not enjoy \"Lego Dimensions.\" Many of the key gameplay elements, from smashing everything in sight to collecting the studs they leave behind to solving wacky puzzles, remain. \nTrue, there also are quite a few new gameplay ideas, including a number of abilities you'll pick up as part of the story as the game progresses, but it doesn't negate the basics that don't really change. \nHowever, if you have ever enjoyed a previous \"Lego\" game, even just a little, then you should give \"Dimensions\" a try because it is, without question, TT Games' bricky masterpiece. \nFeaturing a simple conceit — bad guy is mixing up the dimensions and it's up to iconic characters to save them all — \"Lego Dimensions\" actually gives a plausible reason to mash up any number of characters from across the pop-culture spectrum. \nBut unlike its toys-to-life competitor, \"Disney Infinity,\" the only other game to feature characters from diverse properties, \"Lego Dimensions\" justifies mixing up its characters during the game's story. \nAnd mix them up it does. \nWhat starts as a few characters coming together to stop the evil Vortech progresses to a point where dimensions cross and blend like never before. \nTaken alone, the wacky story would be enough to recommend playing this game. But there is so much more. \nToys-to-life games are notoriously expensive. In the case of \"Lego Dimensions,\" purchasing everything released will set you back more than $500, a staggering amount of money. \nIn this case, it buys you Legos. Characters, vehicles, gadgets and, occasionally, even bonus levels from properties such as \"The Simpsons,\" \"Back to the Future,\" \"Dr. Who,\" \"Scooby-Doo!\" and more. \nWhile you can make it through the entire game with just the Starter Pack, a lot of content will remain inaccessible without at least one figure from each of the game's 14 total properties. \nYou need them to unlock the Adventure Worlds, one for each of the included properties, and these massive worlds include studs to collect, races and quests to complete and much, much more. \nAdditionally, there will be six extra levels, available with Level Packs, three of which were released at the game's launch. \nIt's a metric ton of content that will keep fans playing for a long, long time. \nWhat really sets \"Lego Dimensions\" apart from other toys-to-life games is the way it treats play. Instead of merely placing figures on the pad and controlling the in-game versions of them, you will spend time building toys, rebuilding different versions of them and moving them around the toy pad (called a Gateway here). \nAll the building and moving pieces about keeps you active outside the game and adds to the experience. \nPlayers can breeze through each level fairly quickly if they aren't concerned about finding special bricks and mini-kits, collecting studs and exploring for secrets. That's not what the designers intended, though. \nExploration is key, and revisiting each location to unlock additional secrets is all part of the fun. \nEven the seemingly brief level packs feature secrets to unlock and plenty of reason to play through more than once. \nThe only part that's rough is waiting for additional packs to release, to unlock the game's remaining secrets. \n\"Lego Dimensions\" will drain your bank account, but fans of the toys and games will find plenty here to love. Scooby-Doo is among the bonus levels offered in \"Lego Dimensions.\" ( Courtesy image )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:13:10.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
