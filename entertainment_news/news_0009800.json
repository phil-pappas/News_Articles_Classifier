The CW More + \n\"America's Top Model\" is moving off the fashion runway. \nThe long-running show, currently airing on The CW, will end after this season, it was announced on Wednesday. The network confirmed the reality competition will go off the air after 12 years and 22 seasons. The final runway walk is slated for Dec. 4, though there's talk of a retrospective episode for 2016. \nTyra Banks, host and executive producer of the show, addressed the news on Wednesday via Instagram, writing: \"Thinking #ANTM #cycle22 should be our last cycle. Yeah, I truly believe it's time. Our diehard fans know we've expanded the definition of beauty, presented what Flawsome is, tooched and booched and boom boom boomed, shown the world how to show their neck, rocked couture/catalogue/commercial poses, have found our (and your) light, strutted countless runways, gone on tons of go-sees, added guys to the girls mix, and have traveled around the globe and back again. Yeah, it's time. It really is.\" A photo posted by Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) on Oct 14, 2015 at 12:44pm PDT \n\"'America's Next Top Model' was a successful franchise for two networks, first at UPN and then The CW, and it became not just a ratings hit, but a global pop culture phenomenon,\" said CW president Mark Pedowitz. \"I want to thank Tyra and Ken for all their years of success in establishing a show that was not just popular in the U.S., but all across the world.\" © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.
