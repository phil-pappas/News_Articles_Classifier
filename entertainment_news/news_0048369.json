CBS.com. Peih-Gee Law never saw it coming. But on Wednesday night's episode of \" Survivor : Cambodia ,\" her second chance ended abruptly, just as it will for 16 of the remaining 17 contestants left in the game.\nPhoto courtesy of Monty Brinton/CBS Entertainment Â©2014 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Used with permission. In case you missed it, here is the full Episode 3 Recap . And follow me on Twitter ( @tomsantilli ) for all of my Survivor coverage, including my exclusive exit interview each week.\nPeih-Gee first competed on Season 15, \"Survivor: China,\" back in Fall of 2007, lasting 36 days in the game. She was somewhat of an odd choice to make the list of finalists that fans would eventually vote on for this current season, since her season was not fresh in the minds of newer fans, but it was old enough for original fans to have forgotten her. Even more surprisingly, she actually made the cut, showing that there was still a lot of love out there for Peih-Gee. The truth is, the producers and Probst have wanted her to come back for a long time. She missed the cut a few different times for a few different reasons, but she has always been toward the top of their list as a player they wanted to see back in the game.\nBut her second chance started off with an unfortunate turn, when Abi's personal item, a bracelet, went missing and ended up being found by Abi in Peih-Gee's bag. This started Peih-Gee off on the wrong foot with Abi and that riff ended up being her downfall. Peih-Gee also (obviously) didn't fare too well following the tribe swap, where it at first looked like she was in the majority of her tribe. The original idea was to target Savage, but that changed when Abi was swayed to flip-flop and vote out Varner. And they had every good reason to do so, since he had just had some kind of emotional meltdown following the Immunity Challenge. But Peih-Gee saw Abi's flip as a final straw and turned her sights on Abi. Looking to break-up the close bond of Peih-Gee and Woo instead of the loose cannon Abi, Savage and Tasha ultimately decided to blindside Peih-Gee, making her the third person - and third straight original Ta Keo tribe member - to leave the game.\nI had a chance to chat with Peih-Gee today, about her time in the game, what she felt went wrong, and to get some insight into the Jeff Varner meltdown that we DIDN'T get to see on TV.\nTom Santilli, Survivor Examiner: Hi Peih-Gee! Like I've said to everyone I've talked to this season thus far, it's great to talk with you, but sorry so soon in the season!\nPeih-Gee Law: I know right, well that's all right (laughs).\nTom Santilli: So let's go back to the whole \"bracelet incident.\" That really seemed to be the catalyst of the relationship break-down between you and Abi.\nPeih-Gee: (Laughs) Oh, bracelet-gate. I'd love to be able to take credit for it, but it simply was a complete accident. We were all given bags to use on the beach, and we all decided just hey, everyone take a bag and put your name tag on it and that will just be your bag. So I saw a bag that was hanging up that didn't have a tag on it, and I thought I checked it and I didn't see anything inside, so I just put my name on it. And unbeknownst to me, her bracelet was inside it. She kept interrupting everybody while we were trying to build the shelter, trying to get us to help her look for her bracelet, which was already sort of irritating if you're just trying to get work done. But I do remember specifically telling her, oh your bag was hanging on that branch right there? Hey, I think that's where I actually took my bag from. I was like, if you go find the bag that has my name on it, you'll probably find your bracelet in it. She was like oh I already looked and I didn't see it. So I just sort of didn't really think much more of it. I had no idea that she had found it in my bag much less that she was going around telling everybody that I was a thief and that I had stolen it. Luckily, nobody believed her and everybody actually came up to me and was like, hey, have you heard what Abi is going around saying about you? So that's bracelet-gate (laughs).\nTom Santilli: Take me back to the Live Reunion Show. You are seated in a row next to T-Bird Cooper and Stephanie Valencia and Jeff Probst announces that only one of the three of you has been voted onto the show. What is going through your mind in that moment?\nPeih-Gee: Man, it was such a bummer at first. We were the first row of people that you knew someone was not going to make it onto the show. And when he said only one of you is going on, I thought immediately that it was T-Bird. I was just like oh T-Bird made it, she got on, it's over. But I smiled and kept telling myself don't cry, don't pout. So when he revealed that T-Bird wasn't getting on, you're really shocked, and then it all just happened very fast. I was really, really surprised and happy. I didn't think I was a shoe-in, by any means. But it was just an exciting moment.\nTom Santilli: I'm not really sure you can address this, but there was rumor that you tried - and got caught - smuggling a few items onto the show, including flint. Care to comment?\nPeih-Gee: I've been commenting on it, so I don't see why not! (Laughs) So I'm a jeweler, and I actually fabricated and made a few things, I made earrings out of fishhooks. They were basically some generic earrings that I put some pearls and gemstones on, but for the hook, what I did was take a steel hook and I used a whole plate of them. So those were cool and those I got to keep. But I had also got in a piece of flint, that I had covered in twine and had sewed it to my cardigan to make it appear as if it were a fastener, or a button. That one got taken away from me, but (laughs). Let me just say to those of you out there that consider this cheating, this wasn't something that I brought on to just benefit myself, it would have benefited my entire tribe. But it's also not that different from someone who gets to wear a pair of reading glasses and then they use it to make fire. I just happened to have a jacket that helped me make fire (laughs). Ever since my first season, it was just something fun that I had always wanted to do.\nTom Santilli: I think that's fantastic, and it also goes to show just how early people begin playing the game, well before they are in the game.\nPeih-Gee: You better start preparing way early if you want to do well on Survivor.\nTom Santilli: So what can you tell me about Jeff Varner's \"meltdown\" after the Immunity Challenge? I heard that much of what went down didn't make it to air.\nPeih-Gee: I think we got the basic gist of it. I was fairly out of it after that challenge, just the sun and heat and the dehydration was really getting to me after that challenge. So I almost wasn't paying attention to it. But he basically didn't like that Tasha had called him a rat, and I think he really felt attacked. So his reaction was like, oh you want to call me a rat? I'll show you who is being a rat. He basically kind of blew up everybody's game. Maybe it seemed a bit magnified to us, but you never want to hear someone on your tribe or your alliance putting your name out there.\nTom Santilli: But because of all of that, Varner suddenly had a huge target on his back. But when you talked with Woo and Abi, and Abi tells you she is voting for Varner no matter what the two of you do, instead of just going with that, you sort of took that as the last straw with Abi. It's easy to look back now, but why not just go with the \"anybody but me\" approach and vote out Varner?\nPeih-Gee: Of course. But here's the thing: Abi had flat out said, I'm doing whatever Tasha tells me to. So she had just let me know that she had completely jumped ship, that she was completely in Tasha's pocket. If I vote out Jeff, I've already lost Abi, so that's like two losses in one vote. That's not really worth it. So that's why I tried to protect him after that, I was more thinking about my long-term game. If I would have just gone along with it and laid-low, it probably would have been Jeff instead of me. But hey, hindsight.\nTom Santilli: Being voted onto the show, there has got to be added pressure, knowing that you don't want to let down your fan-base. In your CBS .com day-after interview (video above), you mentioned you felt like you had disappointed them. Do you still feel that way?\nPeih-Gee: It's especially a lot of pressure because you got voted in by fans. So just to know right off the bat that people liked you and wanted to see you play again and see what you could bring to the table this time around...and especially for me. It's been eight years since I've played. So that was really hard for me, I felt like I had a lot of support and that I was in a good position going into this. But I will say that I feel I have gotten nothing but a lot of support from the fans, even after I was voted out early, and that definitely helped take the sting away a little bit.\nTom Santilli: There has been a lot of talk about old school vs. new school Survivor players this season. You identified on the show as more of an old school player. Did it surprise you at all, from going into the game, that you ended up being more of an old schooler? Had you imagined you would have played more of a new school-style game?\nPeih-Gee: Yes. Nobody was more surprised than me to find out that I identified way more with old schoolers. But the older I get, the more that that style of play makes sense to me. And I don't really regret the way that I played. There is a small part of me that hates that Survivor has evolved to the point that someone like Abi, who plays the game with a lot of...without allegiances and somebody who is just a talky, sort of irritating person to be around, that someone like her, people want to now keep her around because people now recognize that person's value as a goat. As somebody easy to beat in the end. It does make sense strategically, but in my heart, it's sort of a tough pill to swallow, that somebody would be kept around who is very irritating to be around.\nBe sure to join me next Wednesday for another episode preview, full recap and instant analysis, and of course, the next exit interview next Thursday.\nPlease check out one of my favorite Survivor sites, SurvivorFever.net .", "external_links": ["http://www.survivorfever.net/", "http://www.twitter.com/tomsantilli"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:43:04.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
