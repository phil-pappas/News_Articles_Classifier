Security Council endorsed the deal.\nRoyce cited a host of factors, including the Iran-Russia alliance backing Syria President Bashar Assad; Iran's testing of a long-range ballistic missile in violation of U.N. sanctions; the conviction of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian on espionage charges while other Americans are also held by Iran; and a lack of cooperation by Iran in disclosing its previous bomb work.\n\"If this is what the last 90 days look like, the next few years look like a disaster,\" Royce said.\n(c)2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved\nVisit CQ Roll Call at www.rollcall.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1739843&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1739843&h=Obama+touts+Iran+deal+%27Adoption+Day%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1739843"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:02:45.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
