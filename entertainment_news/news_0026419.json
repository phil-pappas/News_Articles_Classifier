This Southern suburb of Nashville , known for its Civil War attractions, historic preservation accomplishments and quaint Main Street appeal, is getting a second look for its live music, attracting locals and visitors alike. Though this vibrant town sits on the edge of Music City , Franklin is coming into its own distinct singer-songwriter, back porch vibe described in part as Americana. But Americana for this quaint, yet trendy town goes well beyond the music. The Williamson County Convention & Visitors Bureau sees that common thread, the essence of Americana lived out in everyday life, and has captured it as the heart of their brand messaging. \n\"Americana is a story, a sound, a vibe. Franklin lives and breathes true Americana,\" said Ellie Westman Chin , President & CEO of WCCVB. \"Americana is an experience that means something different to everybody. It's in the history and the shared stories. It's the hum and energy of Main Street and it's the live music happening in Franklin and throughout Williamson County .\" \nAlmost every night of the week there is live music playing at local hot spots like Gray's on Main, Kimbro's and Puckett's Grocery with a steady lineup of music. Puckett's in Leiper's Fork (the original location) fills the house on Thursday nights with Open Mic Night designed for up-and-coming musicians as well as surprise performances by music stars and legends.\nWhen taking in the music scene in Franklin , the experience requires a night out at Music City Roots. This weekly live radio show features the finest roots and Americana music that embraces the traditional and the progressive. Season Three begins October 23, 2015 on its flagship station Nashville Public Television and around the country on American Public Television. Each Wednesday night, four musical guests perform to an audience of 300-600 people from the historic Factory at Franklin . Included in the 14-week series are performances by Americana superstars Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell as well as sets by outlaw country legend Billy Joe Shaver , bluegrass award winners Balsam Range , newgrass founders Sam Bush and John Cowan , songwriting luminary Mary Gauthier and rising blues phenom Jarekus Singleton.  The series is expected to be on at least 85 stations nationwide through distribution by American Public Television.
