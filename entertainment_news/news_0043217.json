Permission given to use photo by Microsoft Microsoft has been pushing its efforts for Xbox One and Windows forward over the past year or so, and whether we've heard from folks working within the Xbox division or others within Microsoft outside of the division, the message has been positive for both products. It seems as though Microsoft is heading toward an inevitable, seamless future.\nIn a recent discussion with Business Insider , Xbox Group Product Manager Peter Orullian talked about the future he and Microsoft see for both Xbox One and Windows. \"Everything will be unified at some point. This is a really big, important part of that,\" Orullian said.\nMicrosoft has expressed great interest in bringing both the Windows and Xbox experiences together as one. For the firm, it behooves them to do that, and the same can be said for bringing more and more Xbox One IP over to the Windows platform. Microsoft doesn't have much to lose in doing that.\nGigantic and Fable Legends are two IPs that will be coming to the Windows or PC platform, and there will likely be more brands to join those two in the future. There has been some talk of Halo coming to PC, however, the talk we've heard makes the likelihood of a move like that seem as if it won't happen anytime soon.\nSpeaking of Halo , our review for Halo 5 Guardians is up now and if you want to head over and check it out, you can do so through this link .
