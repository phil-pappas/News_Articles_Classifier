It is not that, really, as some people who spotted me are trying to say,” Jaguar told Pulse. \n“I had an urgent meeting I was rushing for and with the kind of traffic in Nairobi, I found it wise to use a boda boda else I would be caught in the jam,” he explained. “I was leaving the country for an overseas trip and the youth group I was meeting had to get some serious matters sorted and this was the only option I could get to reach them. \nBesides, did you expect me to fly a chopper on the highway or get a presidential escort to clear the highway?” he joked.
