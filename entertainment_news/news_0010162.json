Benny opined that each composer has a different way of working but the music remains the same. Language is the only difference if one comes down to comparing all music industries since making good music remains the common goal. “It is just that there are different working adaptations with different composers but otherwise music is all the same. Everybody wants to make great music and try their level best to be unique,” the singer told IANS on the sidelines of the ‘Mirchi live in concert with Benny Dayal’ here on Saturday. “It is a great experience being part of all these industries and there aren’t many differences other than the language . The only motive is that everything falls together as one,” he said. Charting out the only difference, the “Highway” singer shared that timing is perhaps the only facet that separates Bollywood from music industries of the south. “When I was down south, in Chennai, the recordings used to start early morning around 10 a.m., while in Mumbai, it all happens post-noon and recording starts late in the evening… that is the only difference,” the 31-year-old said. Benny has sung for films like “Thalaivaa”, “Delhi-6”, “Ladies vs Ricky Bahl”, “Cocktail”, “2 States”, “Hasee Toh Phasee” and “Bang Bang”.
