PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 01:01, Sat, Oct 17, 2015 PH Some dogs misbehaved, others played ball... \nLynn Terry didn't know what to expect when she started taking snaps of dogs in a vintage photo booth to raise awareness for local animal shelters. \nHer pictures became a worldwide sensation and eventually inspired her new book, Tails From The Booth. PH More pretty pooches strike a pose...

Behind that curtain these posing pups and mischievous mutts become superstars in their own right. \nThe first photos posted immediately went viral, gathering praise and recognition from new media and blogs. One article received 215,000 likes and was shared over 40,000 times. \nSince then, Lynn's joyous images have appeared on some of the world's largest websites, from ABC NEWS, Today and People magazine to Good Morning America. \nAnd it's not hard to see why... PH Just one of the blushing beauties in Tails From The Booth PH Not everyone completely understood the principle of sitting still... \nAfter beginning with a photo booth series of photographs of dogs for a local pit bull rescue groupm Lynn custom-built a more suitable photo booth for dogs. \n\"I put two dogs in a booth that were mates and they started looking at each other and licking each other and seemingly laughing at each other in quite the same fashion as we humans do when we hunker down in a photo booth,\" Lynn recalls. \"I knew instantly I had generated something interesting.\" \n\"With the recent loss of my own dog, I decided to hold a campaign for Valentine’s Day where people could get photos in the booth with their furry loved ones. \n\"A particular set of pit bulls came that day and upon editing the photos, I knew right away we may have captured a moment even more fantastic than the first series. \n\"I posted them online and within 24 hours my email was blowing up and these images had gone viral. I was contacted by agents and book publishers and so began the genesis of the book. PH And they called it puppy love \nTails From The Booth is the result of many enjoyable hours capturing the fascinating and endearing interaction between the dogs. \n\"Being able to spend most of my days photographing these animals brings a lot of joy to my life,\" says Lynn. \n\"I’m happy and honoured I could bring a little piece of joy to others.\" \nLynn particularly noticed the enthusiastic response from owners of dogs that aren't usually perceived as being typically cute and cuddly. \n\"Whenever I look at this photo, it brightens up the moment. I love animals and love how you captured these beautiful Pit Bulls,\" wrote one fan. \n\"Thank you for what you do with the photos to show the breed in a good light,\" said another. \nHearing that she brings so much joy and pleasure to the people who see her photographs, simply adds to her own enjoyment, admits Lynn. \n\"Some of the best moments during those few weeks after the images went viral, were all the random kind emails I received from complete strangers,\" she says. \n\"It was so wonderful when people dropped me quick notes to say lovely things like, 'This is my favourite photo of all time. I look at it every day and smile.'” \nTails From The Booth by Lynn Terry (Canongate, £12.99) is out now.
