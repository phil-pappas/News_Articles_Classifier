This touching, at times funny and thought-provoking book, is filled with stories shared from communications with people who have died in a variety of circumstances including war, car crashes, murder and illnesses such as cancer and AIDS. In every chapter, a colorful cast of characters describe the feeling of peace they felt after “returning home.”\nAn excerpt from “Satnav for Your Soul”:\n“I thought I’d tell you what it’s like, being what you call ‘dead’. Funny really, ‘cause we are more alive than you are; we can see everything you know, everything—even the stuff you don’t want us to! … I mean it is a bit odd at first, like being plonked in a foreign country. Everyone speaks the same language which is a help, but you don’t know your way around when everyone else seems to—a bit like your first day at senior school, only without the death grip on your bowels.”\n“Satnav for Your Soul”\nBy Susan Pengelly\nHardcover | 6 x 9 in | 220 pages | ISBN 9781452584614\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 220 pages | ISBN 9781452584607\nE-Book | ISBN 9781452584591\nAbout the Author\nSusan Pengelly lives in the region of North Devon, England, and teaches mediumship and meditation mind work.
