And while many find his blokey schtick annoying, it's foolish to deny his talents - from serious journalistic chops that make him a stand-out when big stories break to that other, more ephemeral quality that finds him completely at home when asked - to borrow from Paul Keating - to throw the switch to vaudeville. He's Ray Martin with added clown.\nBut quite how  those varied talents are best utilised in a permanent prime-time role still remains uncertain - especially after Thursday night, when what had seemed on paper a natural fit for Stefanovic proved to be anything but.\nOf course, it is unfair to lump the host with all or even most of the blame - he found himself ringmaster of an incoherent production burdened by too many guests, an grabbag of mismatched segments and a reliance on rowdy conflict that turned many viewers off.\nSelfie time ...

Or perhaps, with some major re-thinking, it can find its feet and thrive.\nWhatever happens, that long-time staple TV story - \"What's next for Karl?\" - is going to run for a little while yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:46:59.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
