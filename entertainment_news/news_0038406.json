The music runs from 7 to 9 p.m. both nights. \nSeth Warner Trio Friday \nWarner, who manages the Olin Arts Center at Bates College and served as executive producer for several internationally acclaimed classical recordings, has appeared at venues as diverse as the Stockholm Folk & Blues Connection, the Boston Early Music Festival, K+D Music Cruise on the Rhine River in Germany, live on WGBH radio and, recently, at Joe's Pub in New York City. \nHighlights from Warner’s two-decade career include performances and collaboration with The Parker String Quartet and tours with blues singer Francine Reed. He plays Bourgeois Guitars, hand-built in Lewiston, exclusively. Attendees can expect a full range of Americana roots including classic country, folk and blues. \nPutnam Smith Saturday \nSmith, who hails from Portland, could be an old-world troubadour fresh from the 19th century: he lives in a log cabin; plays his grandfather's banjo; and prints up the jackets of his CDs on an antique letterpress. Yet this rootsy multi-instrumentalist songwriter (he also writes and performs on guitar, mandolin, fretless banjo and piano), steeped as he is in old-time Appalachian traditions, is very much a storyteller for the modern age. \nSelected as an Emerging Artist at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival (2011) and noted as One To Watch (Rob Reinhart, Acoustic Cafe), Smith has begun to establish himself as an acoustic tour-de-force. Engaging folks with humor, charm, and storytelling, Putnam has performed in more than 35 states, from East Coast to West. \nRock City’s menu is available until closing. For more information on this and other events happening at the coffeebar/cafe, call 594-4123 or find it on Facebook. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
