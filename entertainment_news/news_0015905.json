The much-loved 1964 Tony Award sensation, Fiddler on the Roof , scheduled for its fifth Broadway revival in November, is often seen as a nostalgic look at a simpler, vanished time.\nThe splendid production at Casa Mañana, however, clarifies the struggles that bring out the vulnerability of Tevye the dairyman, his wife, Golde, and their five daughters as they try to wrest slivers of individual happiness from the constraints of the traditions that keep their families close in their Russian shtetl of the early 20th century.\nYou get big, richly harmonized familiar numbers from a large, deep bench of talent. Under the direction of Tee Scatuorchio, the cast also conveys poignant, wrenching looks and glances. In addition to a deep, warm voice and funny delivery as Tevye, Bruce Winant emotes turmoil as his eyes meet the anguished ones of his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, eloquently played by Sarah Stevens, when she begs her father not to make her marry the elderly butcher.\nLife is hard in Anatevka, where Russian soldiers are under the czar’s orders to create regular disturbances in the Jewish community, Tevye works long hours to feed his family, and the only option for his daughters is marriage, with husbands difficult to find for women without dowries.\nLike a Jewish twist on Jane Austen, there’s education to be had in courtship. Tzeitel begs her father for permission to marry the poor man she loves. Hodel, played by Sophia Kaiafas with spirit and sweetness, pushes him further by asking only for his blessing for her pick. The choice of Chava, played with wounded but determined spirit by Mary McElree, challenges him most of all.\nKatie Dill’s handsome set, bathed in Samuel Rushen’s vibrant lighting, fills the stage with an image of crowded cottages pressed close together, smartly revolving to reveal a kitchen here, a sewing shop there. Tammy Spencer’s costumes convey the homespun reality of their lives.\nAmong the standouts of the strong cast are Mary Gutzi, who gives us a Golde with a tender heart under her brusque manner, and Mary Stout as a deliciously oblivious Yente with no clue as to how amusing she is. As the suitors, Noah Putterman brings nervous, earnest charm to Motel, Shayne Kennon a proud passion to Perchik, and Dennis Wees a sensitive determination to the book-loving Fyedka.\nFiddler offers a reminder of how threatening change can be. It’s also telling of how little we know about the big picture. History tells us when Tevye’s community is forced out, what they perceive as tragedy will be their salvation. It’s estimated that more than 2 million Jews who stayed in Russia died in the Holocaust just a couple of decades later.\nPlan your life\nContinues through Oct. 4 at Casa Mañana, 3101 W.
