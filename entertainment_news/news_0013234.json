Sometime between 1:20 pm and 1:40 pm, Boehner's office informed NBC that the speaker would have to miss the 5 pm taping because of today's events. \nThe \"Tonight Show\" will proceed with its other scheduled guests -- Michael Fassbender, Brie Larson and musical guest Cee Lo Green -- and will not seek a replacement for Boehner, the NBC spokesperson told CNN. \nAs of now, Boehner is still set to resign at the end of the month, though there is no clear successor in place. \nBoehner said in a statement he will remain in his post until a new speaker is elected, though he has yet to announce the date for the new vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:05.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
