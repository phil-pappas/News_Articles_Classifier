Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images On Sept. 28 , 2015, Roger Waters presented the New York City premiere of â€œRoger Waters The Wall\" at The Ziegfeld Theater . The documentary which was co-written and co-directed by Sean Evans and Roger Waters details one of the most elaborately staged theatrical productions in music history as Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters performed the band's critically acclaimed album \"The Wall\" in its entirety. The film is 132 minutes. A fabulous soiree followed at The Redeye Grill . Notables who attended the premiere included Kelly Rutherford, Willa Rowlinson, Kemp Muhl, Lena Hall, Josh Stamberg, Taylor Louderman, Nick Mason, Rula Jebreal, DeeDee Luxe, Trudie Styler, Sting, Kiera Chaplin, Eric Ripert and Rosanna Scotto. Director Sean Evans told on the red carpet, \"I helped build the tour with Roger, I started on it in 2009, we spent a year building it, I was out on the tour for the majority of it. Somewhere along the way we talked about making a film. We kicked around the idea of bringing in a third party director, but we decided to tackle the task ourselves, and here we are.\" He said the message of the film is \"it's an anti-war movie. It's a call for peace. You know, stop killing each other.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/roger-waters-talks-new-film-event-wall-378006", "http://rogerwatersthewall.com/", "http://redeyegrill.com/", "http://www.bowtiecinemas.com/locations/ziegfeld/"], "published": "2015-10-01T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:53:11.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
