But little did he know that the woman’s other lover had been tipped off on his habit and on this day, he had laid a trap on him. \nAccording to sources, the said man deflated the tyres of the politician’s car, after which he proceeded to the house where he caught the two in the act. And after an awkward verbal exchange, the politician headed to the car only to find that all the tyres were flat! What a shame, and with people milling all around him, knowing well what his mission in their neighbourhood had been. \nThe popular politician from Lower Eastern lost his political bid during the last elections while the ‘mpango’ is a businesswoman.
