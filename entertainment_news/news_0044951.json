However, because of his injury, he has been told by doctors he must have complete rest for at least seven days.”Forsyth’s publicist and friend Ian Wilson took him to hospital. \n“Bruce is shaken and stirred. He was really looking forward to doing the TV show so professionally it couldn’t have happened at a worse time, not that something like this can come at a good time.”But he is a lucky man really because he fell and he is alright. He has got concussion so you have to be very careful. All the tests which were substantial have come up fine, but at the same time, at any age when you fall over and bash your head it is not good.” \nForsyth revealed his sadness at having to miss out on the show, which is due to film at London’s Dominion Theatre tomorrow, saying, “I was really looking forward to this show and working with such a talented cast, and I am really sad not to be part of it.”Alexander Armstrong will take over in his absence. \n  10, 2015 9:05 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:21:14.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
