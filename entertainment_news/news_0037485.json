Making up for lost time. Making up with everything I ever did and never did.\" \nThe singer also offered an apology of sorts for the delay in readying the new album, which has been rumored to be coming, oh, any time now since about 2013. \n\"25 is about getting to know who I've become without realizing,\" she said. \"And I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\" \nReleased in early 2011, Adele's sophomore album, \"21,\" sold more than 11 million copies in the U.S. alone and is the biggest-selling record this decade. The album swept the 2012 Grammy Awards, winning album of the year and song of the year for \"Rolling in the Deep.\" \nSince then, Adele, 27, has kept a low profile, giving birth to a son with businessman Simon Konecki in 2012 and resurfacing for occasional projects such as the theme song to the James Bond movie \"Skyfall,\" which won her an Oscar. \nBut now it appears the publicity machine for \"25\" is gearing up. Wednesday's statement followed a teaser promo, likely for for a new Adele song, that aired last weekend on British TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:12:11.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
