Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves to supporters as he leaves an event, Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015, in Franklin, Tenn. By ERIK SCHELZIGAssociated Press \nFRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is channeling 1970s action star Charles Bronson in defending Second Amendment rights in the aftermath of the shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine dead. \nTrump said in a rally in suburban Nashville on Saturday that he has a handgun carry permit in New York. He adds that any attacker will be \"shocked\" if he tries to assault the real estate mogul and that he will emulate Bronson in the vigilante film \"Death Wish.\" \nTrump says that the Oregon shootings could have been averted if instructors or students had been armed. \nTrump's positions on gun control have evolved significantly over the years. He once backed an assault weapons ban and longer waiting periods for purchases. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
