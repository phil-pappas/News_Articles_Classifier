Russell ( Ted Danson ). \"They never used to do that. They are dating!\"\nWhy CSI: Cyber will scare the crap out of you\nAlthough D.B. voices concerns that a pair of blackhats dating violates the deal they made with the FBI when they joined Avery's team, Avery is a little more forgiving. \"They only have each other,\" she says. \"Everyone deserves to get laid.\"\nThat said, Avery isn't sure the fling will last. \"Nelven is a very improbable match,\" she says, bestowing the couple with a proper 'shipper name. And just wait until you see how confused D.B. is by the idea of portmanteaus.\nCheck out the clip above and watch CSI: Cyber Sunday at 10/9c on CBS.\n(Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)\n CSI: Cyber Patricia Arquette Ted Danson Shad Moss Hayley Kiyoko", "external_links": ["http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/csi-cyber/660994/?rss=tv-hotlist&partnerid=spi&profileid=09", "http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/patricia-arquette/169017/?rss=tv-hotlist&partnerid=spi&profileid=09", "http://www.tvguide.com/news/csi-cyber-sneak-peek-who-is-hooking-up/?rss=tv-hotlist&partnerid=spi&profileid=09", "http://www.tvguide.com/news/why-csi-cyber-will-scare-the-crap-out-of-you/", "http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/shad-moss/819708/?rss=tv-hotlist&partnerid=spi&profileid=09", "https://www.tvguide.com/videos/embed/7d297fb9-93bb-4deb-a091-1e2c31363fce/", "http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/ted-danson/176332/?rss=tv-hotlist&partnerid=spi&profileid=09", "http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/hayley-kiyoko/307360/?rss=tv-hotlist&partnerid=spi&profileid=09"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:16:20.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
