The theme of the issue is “REBEL,” and it features a myriad of body positive influencers in both its exclusive editorials and interviews, including Tess Holliday, Hayley Hasselhoff, Georgina Horne, Rain Dove, Joby Bach, and Harnaam Kaur. Often deemed a pioneer of the plus size fashion and body positive communities, d’Amour founded the publication in 2012 as her reaction to the lack of genuine diversity in the glossies. Today, VOL•UP•2 has built an identity surrounding inclusivity above all.\nAlthough plus size fashion and “body positivity” are terms that have been making headlines the past couple of years, individuals who deviate from mainstream interpretations of beauty are still often left behind in the world fashion magazines. Having also featured amputee models, models in wheelchairs, pregnant models, models with cancer, transgender models, female bodybuilders, elderly models, plus size models at the higher end of the size chart, and very slender, mainstream models, VOL•UP•2 has never failed to prove its passion for utmost diversity.\n“[We] showcase women who are often forgotten by fashion in a positive light, and in doing so, actively change how we see beauty.” — Velvet d’Amour\nOnline and print copies of the October issue of VOL•UP•2 are available for individual purchase at http://www.volup2.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2x1cDIuY29t"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:20:46.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
