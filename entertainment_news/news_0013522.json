Photo: Network Ten \nThe sci-fi series Limitless is being overshadowed on Sunday nights by Quantico and The Beautiful Lie , which is a pity because one of its attractions is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio playing a potentially sinister FBI boss named Nasreen Pouran.\nMastrantonio is one of those charismatic supporting actors who adds credibility to any series or movie she's attached to.\nShe was nominated for an Oscar for The Color of Money in 1986, and dominated James Cameron's first underwater extravaganza, The Abyss, in 1989. You've seen her as Anthony LaPaglia's sweetheart in Without a Trace and as a murderously protective mother in Grimm .\nAnnabel Crabb thinks perhaps Scott Morrison has a soft centre, in Kitchen Cabinet. Photo: ABC \nWhere the writers of Limitless are going to take her character is as much of a mystery to Mastrantonio as it is to the viewers. She's been searching for clues and hints about Naz, who is apparently Iranian, in the scripts she's read so far. She reports:\nAdvertisement \"She's very well-appointed. Let me just say, she dresses a particular style. Her office is decorated in a particular way that, as I've been told, this woman has means. She's financially independent, really, and the FBI calling came to her later.\n\"She's divorced. I wear no jewellery on my hands just to ensure that nobody is misled in any way. So, I don't know. I would be very interested, because she would have come of age, if we're going to look at history, in 1979, you know.\n\"I mean, she's my age [56]. So, that was the revolution [in Iran]. That was when it was all happening. So, I don't speak with an accent. So, presumably had I been raised in Iran up until then I would, but culturally and everything, I would love for it to be, because I just think it could be damn interesting.\"\nLets hope Limitless lasts long enough for us (and Mastrantonio) to find out.\nLimitless airs on Sundays at 8.30pm on Channel Ten. \nBeneath the meringue Malcolm Turnbull cleverly gave the job-least-likely-to-make-you-popular to his biggest rival for the Liberal leadership, Scott Morrison. Morrison already had a reputation as a hard man, even before he became the treasurer, and being the constant bearer of bad news for the next few years will be unlikely to advance his standing in the opinion polls. But Morrison fights back this week with an image-softening exercise – feeding Annabel Crabb in the first episode of the new season of Kitchen Cabinet .\nWhen she knocks on the door of a house he's rented on the NSW south coast, he hands her a bunch of pink flowers and serves her Sri Lankan pastries nicknamed \"scomosas\" by his staff. He speaks of his love of the singer Tina Arena: \"I think she's wonderful … such a classy lady.\"\nMorrison seems nervous in Crabb's company, clearly worried about what she'll ask. He denies being a religious extremist or \"happy clapper\", but looks upwards as he discusses the surprise arrival of his first child after 14 years of IVF, saying: \"That's a constant reminder to me of who is charge\" (apparently not a reference to Malcolm Turnbull).\nMorrison says he was just doing his job when he presented himself as a tough guy during his time as Immigration Minister: \"Those who were thinking of making the voyage and, more importantly, those who were thinking of running the smuggling needed to think that … their worst nightmare had arrived.\"\nFor dessert, Crabb has brought a vacherin, a kind of pavlova-cake she describes as \"hard on the outside, gooey on the inside\" and wonders if Morrison is \"constructed the same way\". Viewers may conclude he comes across more like a sponge with pink icing – sweet on the outside, bland on the inside.\nKitchen Cabinet is on Wednesday at 8pm on ABC. \nFor more, go to smh.com.au/entertainment/blog/the-tribal-mind .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:18.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
