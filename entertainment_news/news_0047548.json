Johnson Jr. has been named as CEO at one of the area's fastest growing companies. 5Linx Enterprises announced on Friday that William Faucette Jr. will replace Craig Jerabeck as CEO of the Henrietta-based direct sales company and 2012 winner of the Rochester Top 100, an annual ranking by the Rochester Business Alliance Inc. and KPMG LLC for fastest growth among local private companies.\nThe company said Jerabeck resigned his position after 14 years of service. No specific reason was provided by the company.\n\"This is very good news for our company and the greater Rochester community,\" said Jeb Tyler, who co-founded 5LINX with Jerabeck and Jason Guck. \"It is a brand-new day for our company, and we expect to continue growing, continuing to expand internationally, and continuing to create new jobs in Rochester.\"\nConfirmed: @5LINX names William Faucette Jr. as CEO. He was chief of staff for ex-ROC Mayor William Johnson. pic.twitter.com/pKUilVsmA9\n— Todd Clausen (@ToddJClausen) October 2, 2015 Faucette, 45, rose through the ranks at the city of Rochester over an eight-year period, eventually serving as chief of staff in the Johnson administration for about four years. He was the youngest senior manager to ever serve the city at the time. The Stanford University graduate joined 5Linx as an independent representative shortly after it was founded in 2001.\nHe became vice president of sales of the company about eight years later, and later added duties in compliance, field operations and product development. He was previously recognized as one of \"30 Leaders Under 30\" by Ebony Magazine, and was named Citizen of the Year by the Alumni Association of the African American Leadership Development Program.\n\"This opportunity came up over the last couple of weeks and it’s kind of a natural progression in terms of the roles I played here,” Faucette said. \"It is sobering in the sense that you recognize it’s important we get it right for everyone's benefit, and it’s not something I take lightly.\"\nHe takes over 5Linx at a time when it looks to regain its form as the area's fastest-growing company, growth that allowed it to build corporate offices in Henrietta about seven years ago, offer BMWs and Bentleys to top performers and penetrate markets in five counties with more than 100 local employees and 90,000 independent representatives.\n5Linx was recently named as the 84th largest direct sales company in the world by Direct Selling News. The local company markets products and services in the home, business and wellness categories. Some items include identity theft protection systems and discount travel packages as well as nutrition and weight loss services, Faucette explained.\nJerabeck started his career in telecommunications in Rochester. He founded @Wireless Enterprises in 1997, a franchisor of retail stores, and before that co-founded Cellular Unlimited, which sold cellphones upstate in the late 1990s. In 2001, he started 5Linx with Guck and Tyler. The company employed about 260 people at one time.\n5Linx sold off its telecommunication business earlier to Birch Communications, a sale that took about 30 percent of the firm's revenues with it, Faucette said. Still, the company will be profitable this year and plans to be even stronger next year.\n\"Now we’re focused on growing as we have prior years, so we are very exciting about that,\" he said. \"I take the commitment to the community seriously and am looking forward to not only succeeding professionally relative to the things we do for 5Linx employees and representative across this county and others, but also a good corporate citizens.\"\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ToddJClausen/status/650039208334245888", "https://twitter.com/5LINX", "http://t.co/pKUilVsmA9", "http://5linx.com/"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:51:23.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
