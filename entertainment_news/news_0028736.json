We're really excited – there's a great spirit with all the supporters over here going for it, and [we're] feeling more brave than we did four years ago.\" \nDiscussing the Rugby World Cup final before the semi-final has even been played is a dangerous exercise – but Dobbyn says he feels confident the All Blacks will beat the Springboks. \n\"I think it'll just be joyous. It'll be a dodgy first half but the points will hit the board. The All Blacks are definitely on form,\" he said. \nWatch the video above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:16:21.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
