TBS said Monday that the episode will air on Nov. 10. \nO’Brien said he’ll be joined by his longtime assistant Sona Movsesian, who is of Armenian descent. \nSaid O’Brien: “I think it’s every boss’ responsibility to take their assistant back to their ancestral land. That’s why I’m going to make sure my next assistant was born in a five-star resort in Tuscany.” Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).
