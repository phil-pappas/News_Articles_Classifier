The right-hander hit 11 sixes and three fours in his knock.\nIndia medium paceman Bhuvnehwar Kumar ended with figures of 1-106 in his 10 overs, the second most expensive in ODIs behind Australian Mick Lewis’s 0-113 against South Africa in 2006.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:20:55.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
