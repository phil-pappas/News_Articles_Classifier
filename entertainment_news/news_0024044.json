In tonight's episode, the Doctor and Clara find themselves in 17th century England, where a deadly highwayman going by the name of Knightmare stalks the dark streets of London. However, after finding some mysterious loot that's clearly not of this world, he comes face to face with the Doctor, who is on the trail of an alien artefact. The Time Lord is soon forced to face the consequences of his actions as he encounters someone who refuses to let him turn his back on the things he has done - but as if that weren't bad enough, he also ends up facing the hangman's noose... which is not good... obviously enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:07:31.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
