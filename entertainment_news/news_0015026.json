Throwing up the house lights and bounding through the audience broke the ice as he chatted like old pals to young and old. \nOne unsuspecting 18-year-old has a string of gags related to him as Paddy recalled the days of blankets, not duvets, car chokes and no Facebook: \"We had friends too ... But guess what: ours were real!\" \nWarning us that we would leave the show either saying, \" I want to have children\" , or \"I want to have a vasectomy!\" , the lavatorial humour came thick and fast. Amid the on- screen images portraying the parents' reality of food-smothered toddlers, bomb site bedrooms and CBeebies' Mr Tumble, there was even a picture of Paddy on the loo! \nHis tales of adult faeces and a sexual encounter were somewhat alarming although the physical comedy as he rolled around the floor was a hoot. \nTales of ovulation kits and DIY health check packs were funny too, though the masturbation gags grew a little lame. Share article \nThe second half mixed things up with his comical musings on topics as varied and random as reality TV, spiders, Sunday league football and Sports Direct staff. \nOverall it was a funny evening with a likeable if non-TV sanitised host!
