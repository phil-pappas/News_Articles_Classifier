Just as kids dress as horror and science-fiction film characters on Oct. 31 to elicit sugar-packed treats, shock rockers employ elaborate stage sets, makeup and songs about monster movies to provoke visceral audience reactions and post-concert nightmares. \nRhythm-and-blues singer Screamin' Jay Hawkins (\"I Put a Spell on You\"), who emerged from a coffin onstage and used a skull-shaped microphone in the 1950s, was arguably the original shock rocker. \nAlice Cooper, the shock rock godfather, incorporated onstage executions — no, they weren't real — and wrapped himself in a live Burmese python while performing. Kiss wore ghoulish makeup — admit it, some of you dressed as Kiss for Halloween! Latter-day spooky, Halloween-inspired acts include Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson. \nThere are even entire music genres devoted to singing the praises of creature features. Lodi's the Misfits created horror-punk, while the Dead Elvi perform psychobilly, a tongue-in-cheek rockabilly subgenre whose songs are based on horror and science fiction films. \nThis weekend's Halloween-themed activities include the Chiller Theatre horror convention in Parsippany and a Misfits show in Sayreville. Worry about taking the kids out on the 31st. This weekend enjoy yourself with some hard-rock-Halloween fun.
