It follows a high profile visit to China by Treasury chief George Osborne, who seeks more Chinese investment.\nThe two governments are already cooperating on nuclear power development, with China making a major investment in a new plant in southeast England.\nPrince William, who recently made an official visit to China, recorded a speech for broadcast on Chinese TV outlining the need to combat illegal wildlife trade.\nHe referred to his daughter Princess Charlotte when he warned that children born this year, like her, \"will see the last wild elephants and rhinos die before their 25th birthdays\" unless urgent steps are taken.\n\"We have a responsibility to act on the facts we have today,\" William said.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
