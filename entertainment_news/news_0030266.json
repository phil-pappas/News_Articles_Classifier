Unfortunately, there is bad news for fans as Marvel is rumored to drop one of its major titles, the \" Inhumans \" movie, from its slate. According to Bleeding Cool, after Marvel did some rearranging of titles for their upcoming Phase 3 to give space for \" Ant-Man and the Wasp \", the studio is now planning to continue the rearrangement and cancel \"Inhumans\". The reasons of the cancellation may be varied, but sources said that the main reason might be because of the clash between Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and Marvel CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Feige recently managed to split with Perlmutter and now he reports directly to Disney. The decision will probably lead to a further divide between Marvel TV and Marvel film, which substantially becomes a problem since the Inhumans were firstly introduced on \" Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \" and are likely to remain included on the TV series in the coming years. The report claimed that it was the TV side that pushed to cancel the movie, considering the time and cost needed to establish the saga of the Inhumans. However, Perlmutter still maintains oversight of Marvel's TV group, publishing, animation and other New York-based operations. Meanwhile, Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel TV, continues to report to Perlmutter. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Inhumans News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:08:26.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
