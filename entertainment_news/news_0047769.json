Last year, it established control of one of Syria's 14 provinces, the northeastern province of Raqqa, which borders Iraq.\nThe provincial capital, also called Raqqa, has been declared the seat of ISIS' self-declared caliphate, which spans a third of both Syria and Iraq. The group also has strong presence in neighboring Deir al-Zour province. Both provinces are oil-rich and constitute the stronghold of ISIS in Syria, with access to the border.\nThe group, with hundreds of Western and Arab fighters, has a presence in northern Aleppo province and has been fighting with rebel groups there. It has also established strategic presence in the central province of Homs, taking over the ancient city of Palmyra in May and recently the key town of Qaryatan , which gives it a chance to advance toward Damascus, the city of Homs and other major towns.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Competing terrorists: U.S. faces fight with Khorasan and ISIS In addition to targeting ISIS positions with airstrikes, the U.S. military is also going after Khorasan, part of the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Fr...\nJABHAT AL-NUSRA AND ALLIES : This al Qaeda affiliate is the second strongest extremist group in Syria, with a presence in northern and western areas. It has allied with a myriad of local groups. A close ally of JN is the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham, or the Free People of the Levant.\nRecently, Ahrar al-Sham has tried to portray itself as a moderate rebel group fighting both Assad's forces and IS extremists. Like many moderate groups, Ahrar al-Sham appears to be gaining support from the Gulf countries, who are staunch opponents of Assad, and Turkey.\nUnder the umbrella group known as Jaish al-Fatah, or Army of Conquest, they secured control of the northwestern province of Idlib. This umbrella group includes fighters from Russia's Chechnya region and some Central Asian countries. The coalition groups divide up security and combat efforts across the large province, whose borders are a few miles from Assad's coastal stronghold.\nPlay Video CBS Evening News The problems in training Syrian rebels One of the key parts of President Obama's plans to combat ISIS was to have American-trained Syrian rebels on the ground. Holly Williams reports o...\nMODERATE REBELS : Dozens of armed factions have operated under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army, with a Western-backed military command.\nRecently, some have been trained under a struggling U.S. program to train rebels to fight ISIS militants. There are fewer than 80 such U.S.-trained rebels in Syria, and a dozen others were killed or kidnapped by al-Nusra. These moderate groups have been eclipsed by better-armed and more radical Islamic groups, who fight both government forces and the Islamic State.\nThese moderates are mostly Syrians and are spread across the country. Some have broken off to work in coalitions with al-Qaida-affiliated and other ultraconservative groups. Syria expert Charles Lister estimates there are about 100 armed factions in the country. Some of these have come under attack by Russian warplanes.\nPlay Video CBS Evening News Kurds wage offensive against advancing ISIS militants Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers are on the offensive fighting to stop ISIS militants from reaching a major battle just 35 miles from Baghdad.

But this summer, coalition ally Turkey, with its own sizable Kurdish opposition, began bombing Kurdish rebel fighters in Iraq, threatening the anti-ISIS alliance.
