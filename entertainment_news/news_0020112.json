She tells Markovits how she suffered along with her character. \n“Once, I had to take a little time out,” she said. “I said I needed a cup of tea, had a bit of a cry, and was ready for the next scene.” \nThat’s what the English call “mucking in,” or striking a balance between helping out and getting your hands dirty while maintaining a smile on your face, Markovits writes. Clarke, he said, is good at it.
