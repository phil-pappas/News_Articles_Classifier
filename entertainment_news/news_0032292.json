Who stayed, who was stolen by another coach, and who didn't get a second chance and had to head home? If you missed any of the first battles episode, find video of all the duels below:\nTeam Adam\n1. Jordan Smith vs. Regina Love, \"Like I Can\"\nWinner: Jordan Smith\nStolen: Regina Love to Team Gwen\n2.

Three steals were issued on Monday out of an eight possible. Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams only have one more free pass remaining, while Blake Shelton was the only coach who did not steal an artist in this first episode; he didn't even attempt to.\nFour of the five the artists who turned four chairs in their blind auditions advanced through their battles in this episode - Jordan Smith, James Dupre, Barrett Baber and Mark Hood. Dustin Christensen was the sole loser, but he was stolen by Team Adam, so he advances through to the next round of the competition anyway.\nAs a result of the steals, only three artists were actually eliminated from the show on Monday - Dustin Monk, Tyler Dickerson, and Celeste Betton. Among those three, only Dustin Monk turned more than one chair in the blind auditions.\nThe Top 48 is now the Top 45.\nThe Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m ET/PT on NBC.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oxh2-z-YuA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klunlPSbtNE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcNvyQIzE6s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReW7ABTqXMY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRpZAK_tXHk", "http://www.nbc.com/the-voice", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN9NVZpZTr4"], "published": "2015-10-13T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:05:57.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
