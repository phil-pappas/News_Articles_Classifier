The two were set up as chalk and cheese, Davey as the fun-loving larrikin and Tony the shy mature type. \nDavey interrupts alone time between Tony and Sam. \n\"Two polar opposites, going head to head, it's a bit of a worry\" said 30 year old construction manager Sasha. Despite this, both parties took the date deathly seriously. \"This date is do or die,\" said Davey. \"I feel like my head is on the chopping block\" said Tony.\nAdvertisement The date began with the men actually gambling, via roulette, on alone time with Sam on a yacht. Tony won but Davey interrupted. \nAs the date proceeded, it became clear that Davey was getting the advantage. When asked about possibly being a father, Davey appeared committed. \"The main thing that got me involved is that you're so family orientated, my family is so important to me,\" he said. At one point Tony even asked \"Is it awkward\", setting the tone for the entire evening. \nFrosty lets Tony down gently. \nWhen Sam asked if the pair believed in soulmates, Tony stumbled and stalled asking for a definition while Davey swooped in. \"A soulmate is someone who you feel the most comfortable around.\"\nSam herself didn't appear to enjoy the bizarre and disjointed date despite it's James Bond-like aesthetic. \"Sitting at the dinner table I can sense there's a lot of tension in the air,\" she said. Eventually Tony was put out of his misery and sent home on a liferaft.\nNext was a group date for the remaining contestants. Each bloke was required to set up an activity at birthday party for 30 primary school ageds children as a way to test the men's abilities with kids.\nThe show wastes no time and Tony is sent home on a life raft. \n\"Bon voyage calmness,\" said Alex at the beginning of the date betraying his lack of enthusiasm. But it was soccer player and real estate agent Michael Turnbull who won Sam's heart with a touching fairy tale about a princess called Sam and a magical prince named Michael. \n\"It was a perfect result for me, I'm super stoked,\" he said drawing on a cliche from sports press conferences. Michael and Sam went back to her home for a romantic dinner and the pair shared their first kiss at the Bachelorette pad.\nBy the rose ceremony, both Michael and Davey had received roses leaving Dave, Sasha, Kayne, Richie and Alex unsure of their fates. In the end however it was 25 year old  Mandurah man Kanye who was sent home leaving only six men in the mix.\nRichie gets amongst the kids activites. \n\"I would have loved to get to know her a bit more, but that's the game,\" he said.\n@bhakthi \nMoments before kissing for the first time at the Bachelorette. \nSpectrum", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:40:32.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
