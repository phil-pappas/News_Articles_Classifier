Curfew was imposed in four police station areas.While the procession was underway in a peaceful manner, there was a sudden stone pelting from somewhere and the rallyists turned violent and started targeting the police personnel escorting them. Police resorted to a mild cane charge and fired rubber bullets to disperse the unruly mob. It also lobbed tear gas shells on the crowd after it targeted police vehicles and set on fire a police outpost.
