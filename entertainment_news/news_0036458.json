Hulu's recent acquisition of the streaming rights to \"Seinfeld\" for $160 million certainly provided a jolt to Seinfeld's earnings, in addition to the money he makes from standup tours and his Crackle series \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\"\nKevin Hart came in second on the list with $28.5 million for the year. His movies, including \"Think Like a Man Too,\" \"Get Hard,\" and \"The Wedding Ringer,\" plus his sellout arena tour, helped propel him from fifth place, which was his position when Forbes last ranked comedians' earnings in 2013.\nTerry Fator and Jeff Dunham both ended up high on the list due to their time in Las Vegas. Fator earned $21.5 million and Dunham nabbed $19 million last year, thanks in large part to their Vegas residencies.\nRussell Peters tied Dunham with $19 million. His role as a judge on NBC's \"Last Comic Standing\" added to his coffers.\nBuoyed by his \"Parks and Recreation\" fame as fan-favorite Tom Haverford, Aziz Ansari pulled in $9.5 million. His seven-figure advance for his book \"Modern Romance\" also helped improve his ranking.\nThe bottom five on Forbes' list include Louis C.K. at $9 million, Gabriel Iglesias at $8.5 million, John Bishop at $8 million and Dave Chapelle with $7.5 million.\nReflecting the the comedy industry as a whole, women are notably absent from Forbes' list, which is comprised of comics whose primary source of income comes from ticket sales, measuring earnings before subtracting management fees and taxes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:09:01.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
