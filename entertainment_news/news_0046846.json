That's the premise of Newsies , the musical based on the Newsboy Strike of 1899, which opens Tuesday at the Auditorium Theatre. The Broadway production was extremely popular with audiences, running more than two years and winning more than 20 major theatrical awards and two Tony Awards. Life as a child laborer in turn-of-the-century urban America, though, was no occasion for singing and dancing.\nConditions were particularly bad in New York City, where in 1899 the famous Kid Blink led thousands of newsboys to stop selling the New York World and Journal for two weeks, winning public acclaim and the right to return unsold papers to the publishers for a refund.\nNewsboys were, after all, child laborers, working long hours for little pay in a society yet to develop any real protection for them. Many were orphans who slept on the streets.\nIn Rochester, the plight of newsboys was occasionally a cause for public concern. An in-depth Rochester Union-Advertiser story in 1889 estimated that there were about 500 of them in the city. Some could earn up to $10 a day — the equivalent of about $230 in 2015 — while others \"find it necessary to sleep on the downy side of a plank.\"\nThe article praised the boys' industriousness and creativity, in business as well as the coining of nicknames. Among those profiled in the article: Baldy Sours, Big Fish Market and Little Fish Market, Raise You Five and Bricktop Robinson (also, more troublingly: Rags, Cigarette Fiend, The Big Tramp and Tragedy Charlie).\nAn 1879 article in the Rochester Union-Advertiser suggested opening a home for newsboys and bootblacks where they could sleep, eat and get some basic education.\n\"An institution of this kind makes the boys feel as if there was someone who took an interest in their welfare, and they were not entirely social pariahs, their hand against every one and every one’s hand against them,\" the newspaper argued.\nOthers were less sympathetic. An 1871 visitor complained in particular about those who sold newspapers on trains.\nNewsies is based on the Newsboy Strike of 1899. It opens Tuesday at the Auditorium Theatre. (Photo: Deen van Meer)\n\"The railroad newsboy is a fraud, a nuisance, a swindle, a vermin. He is too insignificant to be noticed, yet he won’t go unnoticed,\" the man alleged on his way out of town. He was cautious to add, though: \"In case this gets into print (before I leave town), will the Local please write a brief but touching obituary notice for a faithful correspondent, and say, ‘He wrote not wisely, but too well!’”\nA week later, 15 agents of the New York Central co-wrote a response: \"There are a great number of old fogeys that travel on the railroads that think everybody are nuisances, even the conductors, and grumble if the train stops five or ten minutes to take water. We think the gentleman (sarcasm) who wrote that in your paper is one of them kind. … If he gets on one of our trains we will give him reason to put something in the papers about us.\"\nOne Rochester boy, Jack Ross, gained national acclaim in 1915 after a 12-year quest to find his parents.\nAs a young child, Ross was sent to live with his aunt in New York City. When she moved, he somehow lost touch with his parents in Rochester, according to a story in the Rochester Herald.\n\"When he became old enough, he started out on his own and took a bundle of newspapers under his arm to pay his own way,\" according to the 1915 article. \"For years young Ross has been a wanderer with the definite object of discovering the whereabouts of his parents. ... His travels across the country have taken Ross to many strange places, but he has not wanted for friends, and he is well known in every newspaper office east of the Rockies.\"\nRochester newsboy Jack Ross in 1915 after being reunited with his parents. (Photo: From the Albert R. Stone Negative Collection, Rochester Museum and Science Center, Rochester, New York.)\nThanks to a tip from a Chicago musician, he learned his father was a fireman in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He went there and was finally reacquainted with his family.\nHe stopped back in Rochester long enough to have his photograph taken, \"one of the luckiest fellows imaginable in having located his father, mother and sister, to whom he is greatly attached.\"\nIt was only at the turn of the 21st century that adult contractors replaced children in selling newspapers, in part because of child labor restrictions, a more sprawling population and safety concerns.\nOne of the latter-day greats was Patricia Davis-Griffin, who in 1982 was named New York State Newspaper Carrier of the Year, the first person from Monroe County to win that honor.\nWith the help of her family, she delivered both the Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union seven days a week, rising at 5 a.m. to get them on doorsteps around the 14608 area code before going to school.\nPatricia Davis-Griffin, in 1982 when she was named best newspaper carrier in New York, and today. (Photo: Provided photo)\nThe money helped support her family, since her mother had a disability and could not work. She has parlayed the work ethic she learned there to a 28-year career at Frontier Communications.\n\"I liked saying hello to the elderly people and interacting with people, not just staying at home playing hopscotch,\" she said. \"I learned how to talk to people, and that's what I do in my job now. ... To be honest with you, if I could still do it, I would.\"\nJMURPHY7@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe93db0c9d5b5d81368829e24daf925896f2f3aa/c=117-0-883-1021&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793802717632545-Leap-S1-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27a2d84eb362bad23620b6f6b7a12fece4db553f/c=0-0-640-481&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635792922611923691-IMG-0403.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792242075433870-jack-ross.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793802717632545-Leap-S1-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635792922611923691-IMG-0403.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6613d7bb221e5019ccb18ca3b00fc398c4f4a29f/r=500x363/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792242075433870-jack-ross.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4f7114f7836a3163648ef2df408eee7e50afa1f5/c=66-0-4012-2967&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792242075433870-jack-ross.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d96614334f8e53ee78330253492a014151910e8f/r=391x400/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793802717632545-Leap-S1-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635792922611923691-IMG-0403.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:53:01.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
