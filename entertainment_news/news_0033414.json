Colloca Estate Winery in Fair Haven (where the state park is) hosts their Annual Harvest Festival this Saturday. And, believe me, if you want to find a way to spend a lazy Autumn Saturday afternoon, this is it!\nLocated just off Rt. 104A on West Bay Road in the Village of Fair Haven, which is just east of here, it’s a convenient, yet out of the way attraction. I know you can make it there in just a little over an hour. I drive out to our cabin next door to the vineyard almost every weekend.\nThe actual fest starts at noon, but the tasting room, dominated by a huge and cozy fireplace and a great view of the pond, opens at 11:00. Activities include Estate Tours for the 100 acre site and of the 900 feet of great frontage on the Bay at 1:00 and 3:00. They’ve got music at 2:00 and 4:00 and Food and Vendors on site all afternoon. And of course, wine tastings!\nAnd in case you get hungry from all this activity, their menu includes everything from corn crab chowder to pulled pork sliders with apple slaw … and wood fired pizza and Panini’s to cheese and charcuterie platters.\nThey’re even having a pumpkin carving.\nBut the stars of the show are the wines. Yum. I’m particularly fond of the reds … cabernet to die for.\nLeaf peeping is available, at no extra charge. And, if you go, wave as you go by!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:04:24.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
