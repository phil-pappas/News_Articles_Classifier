Dion Lewis then went out and produced 138 yards from scrimmage in a 40-32 flogging of the Bills.\nWednesday, Ryan wasn't showing much love for rookie Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota, either.\n\"I don’t think the kids' gonna have his way against us; I don’t think that’s gonna happen,\" Ryan said when he was asked whether his defense needs to show a little pride Sunday in Tennessee and not let a rookie, playing his fourth NFL game, beat them.\nThere is no question that Mariota does not pose the same threat Tom Brady and Eli Manning did to the Buffalo defense, but the former Heisman Trophy winner from Oregon and No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft has gotten his pro career off to a nice start.\nMariota has completed 62.9 percent of his passes for 833 yards with eight touchdowns and two interceptions in the Titans' 1-2 start. That's a QB rating of 109.2, fifth-best in the league, four spots higher than Buffalo's Tyrod Taylor (104.4).\n\"It's three games in, it's early, but he's really done a nice job handing the whole thing,\" said Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt. \"He's gotten a lot of reps, which has helped prepare him, but coming from a program like he did, playing at the level he did, certainly all the attention he got from the Heisman and being a high-profile player, has helped him deal with some of the things that come besides just playing football.\"\nThere were concerns about Mariota coming out of Oregon's spread offense that he'd struggle playing the NFL way. So far, that hasn't been an issue. Not only has he thrown the ball accurately, he has remained disciplined and has scrambled just five times for 25 yards.\n\"Drilling down to the football part of it, he's done a nice job because some of the things he's had to do here at this level for us is a clear departure from what he did in college,\" said Whisenhunt. \"To be able to take that and translate it to some of the limited success he's had on the field is a credit to him and how hard he's worked. We know he's going to be a really good quarterback in this league and that's exciting for us.\"\nMariota, soft-spoken as ever on a conference call with western New York media, said he's not trying to play any particular way. He's just doing whatever comes naturally which, of course, was one of the reasons he was so good at Oregon.\n\"I'm just playing within myself,\" said Mariota. \"For me it's just playing my game, whatever comes natural to me. I don't look to run, or try to stay in the pocket to pass, I just let the game flow and whatever I think is best, I'll make that decision and see if it works out.\"\nBills cut Thigpen: Along with swapping out kickoff specialists Billy Cundiff for Jordan Gay, the Bills also changed punt returners as they cut Marcus Thigpen and signed free agent Denarius Moore.\nThigpen managed only 47 yards on nine punt returns in the first four games, along with 29 yards on three kickoff returns. Last season he joined the Bills late and had a punt return touchdown that helped Buffalo upset Green Bay. Moore will step in to fill Thigpen's duties, and likely be a more useful contributor as a receiver with Sammy Watkins still sidelined due to a calf injury.\n\"We picked up Moore to give us a spark in the return game,\" said Ryan. \"Sanjay (Lal, the Bills' receivers coach) had him in Oakland and for the last three years has tried to get this kid. He'll handle our punt return duties this week.\"\nMoore joins the Bills after spending the 2015 offseason with the Cincinnati Bengals and the first four years of his career with the Raiders. The 6-foot, 190-pounder from Tennessee originally entered the league as a fifth-round pick (147th overall) of the Raiders in the 2011 NFL Draft. Playing in 51 career games with 37 starts, Moore has accumulated 142 receptions for 2,169 yards and 17 touchdowns. He has also returned 42 punts for an average of 6.8 yards.\nPush-ups for penalties : In a move that seems a bit sophomoric, Ryan said Wednesday that players who incur penalties during practice are going to pay the price by having their teammates do push-ups.\n\"If a guy gets a penalty during the practices, then we're gonna make sure that all of us are gonna do 10 push-ups or whatever,\" Ryan said. \"The rest of the team will, and that person will stand up, just to see how many people he is affecting. Penalties are still gonna happen, but we gotta eliminate them to the best of our abilities, especially the self-inflicted ones.\"\nThe Bills lead the NFL with 47 accepted penalties including a whopping 17 last week in the loss to the Giants.\nAaron Williams back: Safety Aaron Williams, who has missed the last two games with a neck injury, was back practicing in full Wednesday and is expected to play. Good timing because the man who replaced him, Bacarri Rambo, may not be able to play due to a quad muscle injury.\nAs expected, LeSean McCoy (hamstring), Karlos Williams (concussion), and wide receiver Sammy Watkins (calf) all sat out practice. Williams seems to have the best chance to play Sunday in Tennessee, but that is still uncertain. Also missing practice due to rest days were defensive tackle Kyle Williams, and wide receiver Percy Harvin. Guard John Miller was back, though only in limited duty.\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:05:21.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
