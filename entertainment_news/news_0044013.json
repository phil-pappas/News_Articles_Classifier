Frankie Bridge (Dominic Lipinski/PA) \nFrankie said: “I was so disappointed not to be able to perform in this year’s Strictly tour, as I’d been so looking forward to continuing my Strictly journey. But following the birth of my son in August, I’m thrilled to have been asked to join the 2016 tour. \n“It will be great to get my dancing shoes back on and be part of the Strictly family again. Roll on January!” \nFrankie came joint runner-up with Simon Webbe to winner Caroline Flack in the 12th series of the competition. Frankie and Kevin Clifton (BBC) \nShe partnered with Kevin Clifton, who is currently whirling EastEnders actress Kellie Bright around the dancefloor, but it has not been announced if he will be joining her on the road. \nFrankie will join competitors and professional dancers from the current series of Strictly as they attempt to dazzle judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Craig Revel Horwood, who also directs the tour. \nThe Great British Bake Off presenter Mel Giedroyc has already been announced as the tour’s new host. Frankie has two sons with husband Wayne Bridge (Yui Mok/PA) \nThe tour kicks off in Birmingham on January 22 and will play 30 dates across Sheffield Arena, First Direct Arena Leeds, Manchester Arena, Liverpool’s Echo Arena, Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle, The SSE Hydro in Glasgow, Nottingham’s Capital FM Arena and The SSE Arena in Wembley before a finale at London’s O2 Arena on Valentine’s Day.
