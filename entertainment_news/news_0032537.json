Every casual conversation manages to steer towards how life-changing it is to give up carbs or eat like cavemen did.\nTerry Crews seems to be guilty of the same sort of thing — only he gave up sex for 90 days, which he spilled to HuffPost Live on Wednesday .\nThe former football player and Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor said that for 90 days it was “ no sex , all relationship, all talk, all cuddle” with his wife Rebecca.\nWhich raises a few key questions from me, mostly could they do hand and mouth stuff? Could they jerk off? 90 days is a very, very long time — certainly longer than the 40 days during which a very horny Josh Hartnett didn't have sex in 2002 .\nCrews added, “I found that at the end of that 90 days...I knew who she was, and it wasn't about 'Let's go out because I know I'm gonna get some sex later.' It was like, 'Let's go because I want to talk to you. I want to know you'.\"\nIn all honesty, “let’s go out because I know I’m gonna get some sex later” might be the only reason why I leave the house.
