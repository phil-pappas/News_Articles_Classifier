The Rev. Steve Markle brought her onstage and asked her the biggest tip she'd ever received. She said about $10.\nThat's when Markle told her the teaching at the church had been about generosity so the congregation had taken up an offering for the driver. She broke into tears.\nThe Columbus Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1LFzFf6 ) reports that the congregation was wrapping up a sermon series on \"I was Broke. Now I'm Not.\" The church draws about 500 to 600 people each week.\n___\nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1LFzFf6"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:32:03.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
