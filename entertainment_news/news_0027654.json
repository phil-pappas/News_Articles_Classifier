Originally based in Lodi, the band has a repertoire consisting almost exclusively of songs about Martians, monsters and dozens of other b-movie horror and science-fiction film characters. \nThe music is accented by the band members' stage garb, replete with skulls and spikes. \n\"As a kid I always watched 'Chiller Theater,' 'Creature Features' and B-movies on TV,\" said bandleader Jerry Only, 56. \"I made my first model, of Godzilla, when I was 4. When we started the band we thought we might as well be about what we liked.\" \nThe Misfits play their annual home base Halloween concerts on Saturday in Sayreville and Tuesday in Manhattan. \"These shows mean everything to us,\" said singer-bassist Only (given name Jerry Caiafa), now a Sussex County resident. \n\"They're like family reunions for us.\" \nThe Misfits literally became a family band when Only's 30-year-old son, Jerry Caiafa II, joined as their new guitarist. \"It's very exciting and I'm very proud of him,\" Only said. \"He started as a guitar tech and a monitor guy on the crew and now he's in the band.\" \nThe Misfits also include drummer Eric \"Chupacabra\" Arce. Previous guitarist Dez Cadena stepped down from his post to battle throat cancer. \nOn Saturday, the band will perform their \"Static Age\" album in its entirety. The disc — recorded in 1978 but not released in full until 1997 — includes horror-punk anthems \"Teenagers from Mars,\" \"Last Caress\" and \"Attitude.\" In Manhattan, the Misfits will play their \"Walk Among Us\" (1982) and \"Earth A.D.\" (1983) albums, whose highlights include \"I Turned Into a Martian,\" \"Night of the Living Dead,\" \"Skulls\" and \"Green Hell.\" \nThe Misfits' influence spreads far and wide, from latter-day horror-punk bands like AFI, the Alkaline Trio and Japan's Balzac to heavy metal icons Metallica. The band's songs are short bursts of energy with catchy hooks that at times contrast their ghoulish subject matter. Some Misfits material has a 1950s feel, thanks to chord progressions that mirror those of the earlier era and original singer Glenn Danzig's Elvis Presley-like crooning. \nThe band formed in 1977 and broke up in 1983, leaving behind myriad unreleased songs that later surfaced on several compilations and a comprehensive box set. Only resurrected the Misfits in the mid-'90s. The band then included Only's brother, guitarist Doyle — he also played with the original incarnation — and singer Michale Graves. The lineup released two albums, \"American Psycho\" (1997) and \"Famous Monsters\" (1999). Only took on vocal duties following Graves' departure in 2001. Ramones drummer Marky Ramone also performed with the Misfits for several years. \nThe Misfits' last studio album, \"The Devil's Rain,\" was released in 2011 and was followed by the live disc, \"Dead Alive!,\" in 2013. Both albums feature the Only-Cadena-Arce lineup. \nOnly said the group is currently writing new songs. \n\"It's great for my son to relive our old stuff onstage while helping write new material,\" he said. \"I've also got family members on the crew. It's great because it ensures the band will continue well into the future.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:20:20.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
