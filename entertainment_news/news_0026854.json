Although massive growth is not likely to continue, consumers have indicated that their waning interest for traditional brews have been diverted to hard cider products or newer brews.\"\n“People are looking for healthier alternatives, particularly when it comes to refreshing beverages,” says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing Review. “One of the things that people realize is that if the beverage has apple cider vinegar in it, more health benefits will be gained. The AC Brew is a refreshing beverage invention which contains apple cider vinegar but is delicious to drink at the same time.”\nThe AC Brew is a beverage invention with apple cider vinegar as its main source of natural nutrients. Everyone knows that apple cider vinegar is good for the digestive system and even aids in the proper function of the body’s immune system. However, a lot of people are still apprehensive to include this in their daily diet due to its strong and overly tangy taste. This invention is formulated to provide people with their healthy daily dose of apple cider vinegar without the unpleasant taste. It includes other natural ingredients such as tea and Stevia which helps in improving its overall flavor.\n“The AC Brew will provide people with a healthy alternative to drinking delicious beverages,” says inventor Roy G. “Most people love to drink instant cold beverages to quench their thirst while having something sweet and tasty. The AC Brew is a beverage invention unlike anything else in the market because not only is it delicious and refreshing, it also provides people with a healthy dose of apple cider vinegar, an ingredient known to provide a whole lot of benefits to the body.”\nEarl McKinley, a vegetarian and health food blogger from Los Angeles, CA, has this to say about the AC Brew: “For those who are conscious about what they drink, it is difficult to purchase something that is not riddled with harmful preservatives. The AC Brew is a beverage invention which provides people with an all-natural drink with healthy ingredients such as apple cider vinegar that is surprisingly refreshing and tasty.”\nThe AC Brew is a beverage invention which will provide so much health benefits without sacrificing flavor.\nAbout World Patent Marketing\nWorld Patent Marketing is an innovation incubator and manufacturer of patented products for inventors and entrepreneurs.
