A traffic accident, however devastating and heartbreaking when a life is lost, is not necessarily a criminal matter.” \nThe accident occurred before Jenner, formerly known as Bruce, announced she was transgender and transitioned into her new identity as Caitlyn. The scene of the horrific crash. Source: Supplied \nSheriff’s investigators previously determined that Jenner, 65, was travelling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions at the time and there was enough evidence to support a vehicular manslaughter charge. \nThe case was then referred to the district attorney’s major crimes division. \nAfter the accident, Jenner released a statement expressing sympathy to everyone involved in the accident. \n“I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them.” Jenner is facing separate lawsuits by Howe’s stepchildren and the driver of the other car involved in the collision. \nThe crash has shadowed Jenner’s much-lauded transgender transition that was announced in a two-hour television special with Diane Sawyer. \nA Vanity Fair cover story revealed her new identity, and a reality TV series I Am Cait chronicled her new life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:36:52.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
