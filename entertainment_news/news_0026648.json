Haha. I am wondering if I should show the picture...body-shaming is always wrong! What do you think?\" \nThe Fast & Furious star then posted a picture of his definitely ripped abs to really hammer home his point. \n\"The pic from yesterday... For those who wanted the show... For all the angels that love dad bod regardless...\" he wrote . \nThe Last Witch Hunter opens October 23. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
