Spectators pose for photos on Wembley Way as they arrive for the NFL game between Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium in London, Sunday, Oct. 25, 2015. By The Associated Press\nThe latest from NFL games around the league on the seventh Sunday of the season (all times EDT): \n8:31 p.m. \nThe Carolina Panthers enter Sunday night's game against Philadelphia playing for a franchise record. \nA win against the Eagles would be their first 6-0 start and would mark their 10th straight regular-season victory. \nThe Panthers are 5-0 for the second time in their 21-season history, the other time coming in 2003 - the year they pushed all the way to their only Super Bowl appearance. \n- Aaron Beard reporting from Charlotte, North Carolina \n5:25 p.m. \nSan Diego Chargers rookie running back Melvin Gordon continues to pay for his two fumbles last week in loss at Green Bay. \nGordon didn't play the first half against the Raiders, who had a 30-6 lead in the third quarter. \nGordon fumbled twice at Green Bay, losing one, and was benched for the second half. He's lost three of his four fumbles this year. \nGordon said during the week that he looked forward to getting back into action. \nBut on Sunday, his powder blue throwback jersey didn't have a hint of a grass on it. \n- Bernie Wilson reporting from San Diego \n___ \n4:40 p.m. \nUnbeaten New England didn't have to worry about a final attempt at a rally by the New York Jets. \nThe Washington Redskins took advantage of their last chance to finish off the biggest comeback in franchise history. \nTom Brady threw for 355 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and the Patriots took a two-game lead in the AFC East with a 30-23 win over the Jets. \nNew York was down 10 in the fourth quarter but recovered an onside kick after a field goal in the final seconds. A false start penalty when Ryan Fitzpatrick was trying to spike the ball after a completion ended the game with 1 second remaining, preventing a final play 37 yards from the end zone. \nKirk Cousins' third touchdown pass of the game with 24 seconds remaining finished off a 31-30 win over Tampa Bay after the Buccaneers led 24-0 in the second quarter. \nMatt Ryan had 251 yards passing and a touchdown, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards to help Atlanta bounce back from its only loss in a 10-7 victory over Tennessee. \nMiami broke a franchise record for points in a half with 41 in the first half of a 44-26 win over Houston. \nSt. Louis rookie Todd Gurley had his third straight 100-yard game, rushing for 128 and his first two touchdowns in a 24-6 win over Cleveland. \nIn other early finals Sunday, Jacksonville beat Buffalo 34-31 in London, Kansas City topped Pittsburgh 23-13, Minnesota rallied past Detroit 28-19 and New Orleans held off Indianapolis 27-21. \n___ \n4:00 p.m. \nJohnny Manziel has replaced an apparently injured Josh McCown late in Cleveland's game at St. Louis. \nMcCown left favoring his right arm with just under 4 minutes remaining. He had been sacked four times and lost two fumbles. \nIt's the first appearance for Manziel since he was questioned Oct. 12 by police in Avon, Ohio, after the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner argued with his girlfriend while driving on a highway. The league has said it is investigating the incident. \nThere was little fan reaction when Manziel entered the game, but the public address announcer incorrectly credited McCown with the first of three straight completions by Manziel before the 2-minute warning. \n___ \n3:35 p.m. \nThe Redskins finally did something positive during a third quarter. Imagine that. \nWashington entered Sunday having been outscored 46-3 in the first 15 minutes after halftime, and coach Jay Gruden said all week he was making that a point of emphasis. \nSomething clicked. \nKirk Cousins tossed a pair of 3-yard touchdown passes in the third quarter - he hadn't thrown more than one in an entire game all season - sandwiched around a successful onside kick, helping the Redskins outscore the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 14-0 in the period to make a game of it. \nThe Bucs, who took a 24-0 lead, did their part to assist the Redskins, compiling seven penalties for 57 yards in that quarter alone. Washington was down 24-21 going into the fourth. \n- Howard Fendrich reporting in Landover, Maryland. \n___ \n3:30 p.m. \nTom Brady isn't getting much help from his receivers against the New York Jets, who took a 17-16 lead on an 80-yard drive capped by a 9-yard scoring pass to running back Chris Ivory in the third quarter. \nThe Patriots had 10 dropped passes going into the fourth quarter. \nBrandon LaFell, playing his first game this season after sitting out with a foot injury, has five of the drops. Julian Edelman dropped what should've been a touchdown pass. \nThe Patriots have slowed Ivory in the running game. He had 29 yards on 14 carries going into the fourth. He came into the game with 460 yards rushing. \n___ \n3:10 p.m. \nAdrian Peterson and the Minnesota Vikings are starting to take control in the third quarter at Detroit. \nPeterson, held to 14 yards on his first 11 carries, broke free up the right sideline for a 75-yard run that gave Minnesota first-and-goal from the 3. The Lions did hold the Vikings to a field goal, but Minnesota leads 25-17. \nIf Detroit rallies to win this game, the Lions can thank defensive back Glover Quin and defensive end Ziggy Ansah, who hustled back to prevent Peterson from scoring a touchdown on his long run. \nBut the Vikings have scored 19 unanswered points since a bright start by Matthew Stafford and the Lions. \n- Noah Trister reporting from Detroit \n___ \n3:00 p.m. \nColts fans at Lucas Oil Stadium booed Andrew Luck as the team left the field trailing 20-0 at halftime. \nNew Orleans intercepted two of Luck's passes during the first half Sunday. Luck was 9 of 19 for 79 yards. \nThe second interception came on a drive that looked like it would end with points as Indianapolis reached the Saints' 18. \nNew Orleans cornerback Kyle Wilson intercepted Luck, prompting boos as the offensive unit came to the sideline and again when the Colts headed for the locker room. \n___ \n2:45 p.m. \nMiami has broken a 48-year-old team record for points in a half, with Lamar Miller running 85 yards for a touchdown to give the Dolphins a 41-0 lead over the Houston Texans. \nIt was the second first-half blowout in two days at Sun Life Stadium, where Clemson led Miami 42-0 at intermission on Saturday. The Tigers went on to a 58-0 victory against the Hurricanes. \nRyan Tannehill was 12 of 12 for 231 yards and four touchdowns in the first half, and Miller had 175 yards on 14 carries. \nMiami's previous record for a half was 35 in 1967. \n___ \n2:35 p.m. \nTom Brady was all fired up for a showdown with the New York Jets. \nThe New England quarterback had been roughed up by the Jets' pass rush for most of the first half Sunday. After a completion to Brandon LaFell with 3:04 left in the half, Brady threw a fist in the direction of Quinton Coples, then went face mask to face mask with the Jets linebacker. \nWhen the replay was shown on the stadium video board, the crowd started chanting Brady's name. \nThe Patriots lead the Jets 13-10 at halftime. \n___ \n2:30 p.m. \nThe first quarter of Sunday's game between the Colts and Saints was strange, to say the least. \nNew Orleans used all three of its timeouts before the quarter ended - two of which were lost to challenges that weren't overturned. \nSean Payton threw the challenge flag twice after Marques Colston and Benjamin Watson both had catches ruled incomplete after bringing the ball in and eventually losing possession as they came to the ground. Both challenges were used on the same drive. \nWhen the second challenge wasn't overturned, New Orleans faked a field goal on fourth down and picked up 22 yards when Luke McCown threw to Benjamin Watson. Then, the Saints punched it in with Khiry Robinson from one yard. \nOn the next Saints possession, Drew Brees scrambled to avoid a sack and heaved a desperation pass off of his back foot only to be intercepted by the Colts' Vontae Davis. However, a defensive holding call on the play negated the turnover. Payton then used the Saints' final timeout before the first quarter ended. \n___ \n1:31 p.m. \nThe Dolphins' Jarvis Landry ran about 100 yards for a 50-yard reception in the first quarter against Houston. \nLandry caught the pass from Ryan Tannehill near the left sideline at the Texans 35 and almost stepped out of bounds. He cut back around linebacker Brian Cushing, ran past six other defenders as he angled toward the right corner of the end zone and again reversed his field before falling across the goal line across the field as he was tackled from behind by Cushing. \n- Steven Wine reporting from Miami. \n___ \n1:30 p.m. \nAll in one fell swoop, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got Mike Evans and their first-quarter offense going. \nEvans, off to a quiet start to Year 2 after a tremendous rookie campaign, caught his first touchdown pass this season - a 40-yard touchdown pass from Jameis Winston on Tampa Bay's third play from scrimmage against the Washington Redskins. \nIt was also the Bucs' first TD in any opening quarter this season. \nHeading into Sunday, Tampa Bay had been outscored 38-9 in that period. \nProbably helps that the Redskins are missing both of their starting cornerbacks, DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver, who are injured. \n- Howard Fendrich reporting from Landover, Maryland. \n___ \n1 p.m. \nThe NFL's experiment of streaming the Bills-Jaguars game went off without any massive glitches but showed why it might not be viable for more than the occasional game. \nMany fans reported intermittent choppiness in the feed. Some of that likely stems from their own Internet connections, but it's a reminder of why a streaming-only option is probably not a widespread option for the time being. \nJacksonville's wild 34-31 win over Buffalo in London on Sunday, which started at 9:30 a.m. EDT, was available only through Yahoo worldwide everywhere other than the two home markets, where it was televised on CBS. \n-Rachel Cohen reporting from New York. \n___ \n12:10 p.m. \nThe top wide receiver active for the Chiefs on Sunday against Pittsburgh has eight receptions all season. \nGood luck with that, Alex Smith. \nJeremy Maclin passed the league's concussion protocol after getting hurt last week in Minnesota, and he practiced Friday. But the Chiefs' leading receiver was inactive against the Steelers, which means Smith won't have the biggest weapon left in Kansas City's popgun offense on the field with him. Jamaal Charles is already out for the season with a knee injury. \nRunning back-turned wide receiver De'Anthony Thomas has just eight receptions this season, making him the Chiefs' top pass-catcher aside from tight end Travis Kelce. Jason Avant and Chris Conley, who is starting in Maclin's place, have just seven receptions apiece. \nAt least Smith and the Chiefs have this going for them: Pittsburgh's pass defense is allowing more than 280 yards per game, 26th-best in the league. \n___ \n11:41 a.m. \nKeep Adrian Peterson in your lineups. \nThe Minnesota Vikings star running back is active Sunday at Detroit, a day after being downgraded to questionable with an illness. \nPeterson had 134 yards rushing and 29 carries, both season highs, last month at home against Lions. In his first 13 games against the Lions, Peterson ran for 100-plus yards eight times and scored 11 touchdowns on the ground. \n- Larry Lage reporting from Detroit \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nKevin Harlan and Rich Gannon typically call games for CBS, but on this particular football Sunday, their microphones say \"NFL on Yahoo.\" \nThe league is experimenting with streaming the matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars from London. With kickoff at 9:30 a.m. EDT, it is available only through Yahoo outside of the teams' home cities, not just within the United States but around the world. \nThe NFL wants to figure out whether there's significant money to be made in distributing games \"over the top\" - streaming them directly to fans. Yahoo and other tech companies such as Google and Apple could be future partners in how the league broadcasts the sport, to go along with its traditional deals with the television networks. \nViewers in Buffalo and Jacksonville are able to watch Sunday on their local CBS stations. Everywhere else, anyone with an Internet connection can see the game for free. The stream is available on any device through various Yahoo properties, including Tumblr, and the NFL's website and app. \nFans are still able to watch on their televisions if they own connected devices or sets. \n___ \nA previous version of this story incorrectly listed T.J. Barnes as the New York Jets player arguing with Tom Brady. It was Quinton Coples. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
