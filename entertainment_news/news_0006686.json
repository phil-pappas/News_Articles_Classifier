But at the same time I was torn because as a kid you want to do things. \n''And my mum was very keen on keeping me away from temptation. I was not part of the social scene in high school. I wasn't going to parties, I wasn't drinking, I wasn't smoking, I definitely wasn't smoking weed, I wasn't having sex.'' \nHe added: ''I was a late bloomer, really late bloomer.'' \nThe 'Sure Thing' hitmaker - whose real name is Miguel Jontel Pimentel - started to go against his mother's strong views and opinions when he reached college. \nHe explained: ''It was like living a double life. I was doing a lot of things I'm not supposed to be doing, that are viewed by the Bible as immoral. So I decided, if I was going to that, I wasn't going to pretend to be something I'm not.'' \nHe added: ''I'm still very much in touch with my spirituality, I never gave up on God. I just found my own way.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:23:58.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
