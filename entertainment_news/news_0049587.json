The national awards program feature exceptional designers in the categories Kitchen + Dining, Master Retreats, Kid-Tastic Spaces, Outdoor Living- Elevated, Big City Digs, Organically Inspired, Posh Public Spaces, Small Spaces That Live Large, Crazy for Color, Great First Impressions, Design With a Passion and Honorable Mentions.\n\"We are all very proud of Tatiana and her accomplishments,\" said Todd Jackson, Founder and CEO of Jackson Design and Remodeling. \"Tatiana is an exceptional designer and her nomination in this national awards program is proof of her hard work, commitment and talent. She inspires our design team to think outside the box while delivering extraordinary service to our clients.\"\nMachado-Rosas is nominated in the Kitchen + Dining category for her innovative work on an open-concept kitchen and dining space in a San Diego home. The JDR team led by Machado-Rosas, along with Design Assistants Olga Trujillo and Priscilla Jimeniz and Residential Designer John Kavan, changed the location of the kitchen to take advantage of the home's gorgeous views and to make the new kitchen the focal point of the home. The homeowners have an appreciation for both classic and modern artistry and wanted a kitchen that would showcase their taste for elegant and artistic design. The refined black and white palette of the new kitchen is balanced by the contemporary feeling of clean, disciplined lines, while the cooktop's custom hood punctuates the space with originality.\nWith the kitchen relocated, the breakfast area now flows easily into the formal dining room. The homeowner's fascination with interesting \"statement\" light fixtures is expressed in the space, which is now open, light-filled and connected to the rest of the home and to the natural surroundings with French doors in a stylish bold black. Now open and fluid, the kitchen and dining areas are graceful and chic while also offering a highly functional environment for spending time with family and entertaining. Oak flooring with a distinct dark brown stain and a hint of whitewash contribute to a unified feeling in the space.\nTo view all of the nominated designers' projects and to vote, click here .
