Which is why the Fort Lee Film Commission is bringing it to North Jersey on Saturday – the first screening for the general public since it was shown on TV more than 60 years ago. \nA \"tor\" is a high, craggy hill. The high tor of \"High Tor\" is on the Palisades, near the Tappan Zee (there is a High Tor State Park in Rockland County). \nThis is where playwright Maxwell Anderson happened to be living in 1936. And it’s what inspired him to write his non-musical play \"High Tor,\" a Drama Critics Circle winner for 1936-37 that originally starred Burgess Meredith — now remembered as the Penguin on TV’s \"Batman,\" but back then a Broadway leading man who also lived in that part of Rockland County, along with many other theater folks. \n\"Helen Hayes was living there, and Katharine Cornell had a place up there,\" says Yranski, senior film and video historian of the New York Public Library from 1978 to 2009. \"A lot of Broadway people used to commute by speedboat up the Hudson River after they finished their plays at night.\" \nFor TV’s musical \"High Tor,\" two decades later, Anderson snagged one of the top entertainers of the era for his lead: Bing Crosby. But because Crosby hated live broadcasts (then standard practice for entertainment specials), it was arranged that the CBS special would be filmed in Los Angeles, Hollywood-style, at the RKO studios. \nThis made \"High Tor\" TV’s first de facto TV movie. It also opened the door to a possible theatrical release later on. \nNor was this \"High Tor’s\" only first. For a key role, Crosby selected 20-year-old Julie Andrews, fresh from her success in Broadway’s \"The Boy Friend\" and about to make theater history as the original Eliza Doolittle in \"My Fair Lady.\" Officially, 1964’s \"Mary Poppins\" was Julie Andrews’ film debut (she won an Oscar). But as Yranski points out, it was really \"High Tor.\" \n\"One of the great things is seeing how absolutely spectacular Julie Andrews looks and sounds in the piece,\" Yranski says. \"She has her full four-and-a-half octave range, she’s good in the romantic as well as the wistful scenes, and you can see the star quality coming out that Disney will later capture in ‘Mary Poppins,’ even though that was a good eight years away.\" \nAndrews herself would disagree; she called her performance \"very stilted.\" But her slightly nervous quality, Yranski says, was very apt for the character she plays: Lisa, the ghost of a 17th century Dutch woman killed in a shipwreck, still waiting for the ship that will bring her home to Amsterdam. \n\"High Tor\" is a whimsical romantic fantasy in the \"Brigadoon\" mode. Crosby plays a lovable layabout (the kind of character he played to perfection in dozens of movies) who is pressured by his fiancée (Nancy Olson) and a greedy developer (Hans Conried) to sell his land on the Palisades to strip-miners. Trapped by a landslide on High Tor, he comes upon a bevy of ghostly Dutch settlers from 300 years ago, who help teach him the true value – beyond money — of his land. \nA timely story for us now, in an era when fracking and overdevelopment are staple topics of the editorial pages. But a particularly relevant story for those of us who live at or near the Palisades, says Tom Meyers, executive director of the Fort Lee Film Commission. \n\"There’s this question of building above the tree line, this constant battle to preserve the Palisades,\" Meyers says. \"As the area becomes more populated, it’s important to understand that one of the great assets of living in this area is having the Palisades in your back yard. From our point of view, this is a great tool to educate people that this struggle to preserve the Palisades goes on. Every generation has to become a stakeholder.\" \nLike the Palisades, \"High Tor\" hasn’t necessarily been valued at its worth. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:54:39.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
