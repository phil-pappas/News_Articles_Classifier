John Madden does. The legendary football coach and broadcaster, inducted into the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame on Sept. 19, said in a video interview that, growing up in Daly City, his first play-by-play hero was McDonald, who called San Francisco Seals baseball games in the ’40s. His home run call, said Madden, was “It’s gone! It’s out Aunt Maggie’s window!” As a broadcaster himself, Madden was teamed with Gene Nelson on KSFO, then Frank Dill and Mike Cleary on KNBR, then Al Hart and, now, Stan Bunger on KCBS. “All Hall of Famers,” he noted. On TV, it’s mainly been Pat Summerall and Al Michaels . “That’s pretty good. I’m the luckiest guy in the world.”\nLuck was given a lot of credit by this year’s inductees, at a luncheon at the Basque Cultural Center in South San Francisco, but there also was plenty of talent in the room. Dusty Street , presented by Norma Dale , widow of the marvelous DJ Bobby Dale , said her induction was “bittersweet,” as three people crucial to her career were gone: Dale and two fellow KSAN staffers, DJ Abe “Voco” Kesh and program director Tom Donahue . “He saw something in me,” she said. MC Terry McGovern saw something, too. He recalled his first morning at KSAN. Street, who’d just finished her all-night shift, popped up in front of him, lifted her blouse and said, “Welcome to KSAN!” Street shouted, “I did that to everyone!”\nNewscaster Gil Haar , recalling his debut on the radio, noted that he was 14 in 1944 and paused to let the audience do the math. Haar, who was let go from his last job, on KFRC, in 2001, said, “I’m really honored, as much as anything else, that anybody remembers me!”\nKCBS reporter Mike Colgan recounted how radio journalists could operate in the old days. There were five local reporters from different stations who comprised CNN — “the Colgan News Network” — in the ’70s. Unable — or not particularly interested enough — to cover multiple stories in a single day, they agreed that each would tackle a different news conference or event, dub his best soundbites onto cassettes, and share them with the others, thus amazing their bosses with their ability to be everywhere.\nHarvey Stone , former manager at KBLX, was also an innovative sort, beyond helping make “The Quiet Storm” format an industry phenomenon. In his earlier years, he said, he had an advertising agency, called “Shticks and Stone.” “And I was the No. 1 shtick.”\nAnd Lissa Kreisler , co-host of the morning show on KBAY, marveled at being at only two stations in 27 years. Talking about her family, she remarked that she’s “shared everything” on the air. “I’ve told everything, I think, but my bra size.” Kreisler attributed her longevity to having taken advice from her first boss, Bill Weaver , to do radio “for your community,” and “to make a difference.”\nThe induction, which also honored the late KSFO music librarian Elma Greer , KSFO programmer Peter Scott and Ken Nielsen , a pioneer engineer and teacher, ran smoothly, as few speakers went over the time limits of three minutes for presenters and six for inductees. The only flagrant violator was former TV reporter Rigo Chacon , who ignored the “ Ralph Barbieri chimes,” sounded in honor of the former KNBR star whose acceptance speech in 2011 went on for 24 minutes. Chacon took almost nine minutes to introduce Colgan. Afterwards, McGovern quipped: “Ralph Barbieri just called Rigo and said, ‘Right on!’”\nGiants in the house: Belated thanks to the Giants. Sure, it was another odd-year disappointment, but they acquitted themselves well, on the field and on the air. One major boost to the broadcast team was retired third base coach Tim Flannery , an overnight sensation on Comcast Bay Area Sports. “Flan” now has more time for his music (he’s released more than a dozen country-rock and bluegrass albums) and fundraising work (for Bryan Stow and for his Love Harder Project, which raises funds to battle violence and bullying.) He took his act to Slim’s last month. His opening act? Pitcher Jake Peavy , who learned guitar from Flannery a dozen years ago. Backstage, Peavy insisted that he never wanted to play music to a big crowd, but onstage, he was a natch, with a brawny Southern rocker of a voice. It didn’t hurt that the evening before, he’d won a game and smacked a home run. The crowd was with him and his band from the first pitch.\nIn the audience were Stow, Angel Pagan and ex-Giant Andres Torres , who joined Peavy onstage and brought on Flannery’s band, the Lunatic Fringe. Coach and company did a robust set, including tunes from his latest CD, “Three Ring Circus,” with a cover a shot of his three World Series rings. Between sets, I spoke with Pagan. A while back, I wrote an item about how the Giants’ announcers pronounced his name. All but Jon Miller say “Angel,” while Miller uses the Spanish “An-HEL.” Which does he prefer?\n“I’m happy with both,” he said. “But I love how Jon Miller pronounces my name. He can do some Spanish broadcasting, he’s so good. But I enjoy listening to all of them.”\nPoster child: The producers of the documentary, “KSAN Jive 95: The Movie,” have launched a crowdfunding campaign at Indiegogo ( http://igg.me/at/igg-ksan/x/10281214 ). Among the perks being offered: A new KSAN poster by Shirryl Bayless , daughter of Wes Wilson , the legendary Fillmore era poster artist. \nThe film is in production. Says co-producer and former DJ Kenny Wardell , “The 10-year period of ‘Jive 95,’ from 1968 to 1978, was pivotal in the formation of many new concepts and ideas not only about radio, but also about the culture.”\nBen Fong-Torres is a freelance writer.
