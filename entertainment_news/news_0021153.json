Rough Cut (no reporter narration)   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) It was all about business and clean colours at Sao Paulo Fashion Week on Monday (October 19) as some of Brazil's top designers showed off their latest winter lines in Brazil's premier fashion event. The 40th edition of SPFW started on Sunday (October 18) and will run through Friday (October 23). Hot out of the gates was ANIMALE, the Rio de Janeiro based, high-end women's label. The winter collection of the SPFW staple did not let down with its clean, flowing looks accentuated by large overcoats and bags to compliment solid colors of black, white and earth tones splashed with reds and greens. The creative director for SPFW, Paulo Borges, said the 40th edition was even more special as it comes as Brazil faces its worst recession in decades. Sao Paulo Fashion Week is regarded as the world's fifth largest fashion week and is considered the premier fashion event in Latin America.  //reut.rs/1MAqXzj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:18:50.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
