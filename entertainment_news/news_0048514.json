The release of the film was postponed after one of the film’s producers Anwar Kabir procured a stay on the film’s release from the Madras High Court stating that the other producer of the film, Ram Kumar, owed him a sum of `1 crore and `30 lakh. He contended that the film be allowed to release only after the sum due to him was paid. Accepting his plea, the High Court granted a two-week stay on the release of the film. Sources say that recently, the case came up for hearing again and director Ram Kumar submitted a cheque for `58 lakh to the court. After this, the stay on the film’s release was vacated. The film, which features Narain, Srushti Dange and Suri in the lead, is a comedy which will focus on farmers’ issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:09:59.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
