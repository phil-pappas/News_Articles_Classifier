Police said the two victims, one 16 years old and the other 20, were seriously wounded.\nThe attack took place in Pisgat Zeev, a Jewish settlement in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel considers the entire city its undivided capital.\nEarlier Monday, elsewhere in Jerusalem, police officers noticed a Palestinian man acting suspiciously and ordered him to take his hand out of his pocket, Israeli police spokesperson Luba Samri said. The man then attacked an officer with a knife, but the officer was wearing a protective vest and was not injured, she said. Other officers shot the attacker dead, police said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:05:38.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
