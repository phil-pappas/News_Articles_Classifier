What's even worse, more than 17 million Medicare beneficiaries will see their Part B premiums rise 52%, more than 10 times the recent rate of health care inflation. It's all part of a perfect storm caused by low inflation and the Social Security Act.\nUSA TODAY\nTips for Social Security recipients worried about no COLA for 2016\nThe \"hold harmless\" provision of the Social Security Act forbids the cost of higher Medicare Part B premiums from being passed on to most beneficiaries when they don't get a raise in their Social Security benefits, according to the Center for Retirement Research. So 70% of Medicare beneficiaries will pay the same Medicare Part B premium in 2016 as they did in 2015: $104.90. The other unlucky 30% of Medicare beneficiaries are left to pick up the tab.\nAt the moment, most of that 30% will see their premium rise to $159.30 per month. But 3.1 million with incomes above $85,000 could see premiums rise to anywhere from $223.00 per month up to $509.80.\nThe people hit with higher premiums include new enrollees during the year (2.8 million); enrollees who do not receive a Social Security benefit check (1.6 million); high-income enrollees (3.1 million); and dual Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries, whose full premiums are paid by state Medicaid programs (about 10 million).\nUSA TODAY\nMedicare Part B premiums to rise 52% for 7 million enrollees\nThe culprit: The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) did not rise enough in the 12 months ended September 2015 â€” used to determine the COLA, according to a report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Thursday that inflation, as measured by the CPI-W, fell 0.6% over the 12 months ending September. For Social Security beneficiaries to receive a COLA, the CPI-W must rise. Social Security recipients did not receive COLA adjustments in 2010 and 2011 because of low inflation.\nUSA TODAY\nAARP: What's wrong with Social Security COLAs\nThe only way that could change for seniors in 2016 is if Congress changes the hold harmless law or if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decides against the increase.\nThe Part B premium for 2016 will be announced this fall. If the past two years are any indication, Medicare recipients should get the final word on premiums before the end of the month.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2015/10/07/medicare-part-b-premiums-rise-2016/72621746/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef1990275b9b4a707053cba9dc9bab108a6ae0cb/c=0-108-2122-1307&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805120669832056-ThinkstockPhotos-135448176.jpg", "http://imgur.com/WghJwpE.jpg", "http://imgur.com/cMdgh4g.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/10/14/faqs-social-security-colas-aarp/73033652/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe99da13e1362b2994f7026a550963ed44d82f36/c=35-0-373-338/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798182159155834-med-costs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b696fc57ec6d833de1b2045dd095ed16864c7d0/c=0-14-187-201/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791308218615771-Deb-WHitman-AARP-Photo.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/10/15/tips-social-security-recipients-worried-no-cola-2016/73993428/"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:27:59.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
