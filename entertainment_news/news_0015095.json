Close In ‘Suffragette,’ recreating the silhouettes of social change Carey Mulligan in the film “Suffragette,” which follows proto-feminists in London’s East End, fighting for the right to vote. (Steffan Hill/Focus Features via The New York Times) Published October 19. 2015 12:01AM RACHEL LEE HARRIS, New York Times News Service \nScouring flea markets and consignment shops for a vintage coat may be the makings of a leisurely weekend afternoon for chic, 21st-century bohemians, but for working-class women in early 20th-century Britain, finding a used coat at a bargain price was a matter of survival. \n“These women aren’t going for a delicate afternoon tea in the gentle Edwardian puffs of the day,” said Jane Petrie, the costume designer of the film “Suffragette.” \n“They need money for food. They have to run after their children,” she added, so the vibrant secondhand markets of the time afforded them a sturdy, albeit worn, wardrobe. \n“Suffragette,” released in theaters Oct. 16, follows a subset of those enterprising women: proto-feminists in London’s East End, fighting — at times with bricks and bombs — for the right to vote. \nThe movie mixes fictional characters like Maud Watts (played by Carey Mulligan), a poor factory worker and new convert to the cause, with real-life figures like Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep), a leader of the suffragist movement. In keeping with the project’s historic underpinnings, Petrie used as many authentic pieces as possible in the film, some almost 100 years old, she said, to “really bring out the sense of poverty in the clothes.” \nShe approached the film as she would any other “gritty urban drama,” she said, and pored over the work of early street photographers like Edward Linley Sambourne. \n“I didn’t want any theatrical devices, and then, I thought, we might get something real.” \nPetrie and Mulligan spoke by phone from London about the influences on the suffragist’s silhouette. Here are excerpts from the conversation. \nThe recruit \nThe film opens with a close-up of Maud’s back. Sweat stains the spine of her thin blouse as she scrubs linens in an East End laundry. \n“These women worked in horrendous conditions, in ill health, horrible hours,” Mulligan said, “so there was definitely a weight to the costumes of everyone working in the laundry, all of us hunched over, reflecting this sense of drudgery. Maud wasn’t dressing for effect; she was dressing for survival.” \n“Tired” is the word Petrie used to describe Mulligan’s looks early in the film. \n“Everything has a sort of sag to it, but there’s no weakness,” she added quickly. Like the women in the film, the clothes were “strong, sturdy, just in need of some relief.” \nOn set, repairs were necessary several times a day to keep the clothes from coming apart at the seams. During a riot scene in front of Parliament, several women, including Mulligan and a sister soldier played by Anne-Marie Duff, are dragged through the street by the police. \n“Anne-Marie’s shirt had to be sewn up after every take,” Mulligan recalled. “It was in tatters by the end, but it was worth the effort.” \nRespectability was another big part of Maud’s survival, Mulligan said, “and when she loses that”— through her association with radical suffragists —“she loses everything.” But that’s also when Maud’s look begins to transition, she said. She adopts a small bow tie, brighter fabrics, jauntier hats. \n“She becomes more eclectic because she’s getting hand-me-downs from women who had more money than her. She’s empowered and begins to emulate these women she’s meeting.” \nThe chemist \nFor the more radical activist Edith Ellyn (a chemist based on several suffragists and played by Helena Bonham Carter), Petrie said she looked for women who were “doing unusual things with their lives, women who were involved in the early days of flight, playing golf. There were a lot of young, sporty women, and that’s the look at lot of suffragettes went for.” \nThere are glimpses of early women’s sportswear in the film: jumpers, even trousers, “kind of like today’s gaucho pants,” she said. “A-line skirts were coming in, lines were getting cleaner, moving away from the residue of the bustle. There’s even the hint of Edith’s waistline starting to drop, so you can just see the 1920s coming. Clothes were becoming more versatile, more free; you could see them starting to shed some of those Edwardian layers.” \nWomen who were incarcerated for their activism, as Bonham Carter’s character often was, received a medal from the suffragists upon release, and those who went on hunger strikes earned extra bars for their medals. \n“Edith’s health is in decline, and you can see it’s because of her many bars,” Petrie explained. \nTo recreate the medals, she went to the British company that originally made them, Toye, Kenning and Spencer, which kept an archive and was able to reproduce the awards from the original die casts, she said. “It was a really lovely thread connecting us to the women who originally wore them.” \nThe leader \nEmmeline Pankhurst’s look was no great departure from that of the real-life suffragist organizer, Petrie said, “but I definitely pared it down. Her clothes would have been busier than what I did. There would have been more layers, more ruching, pleating going on, but I didn’t want to get too concerned with all the layers and fashions of the day and distract from what she was doing there.” \nPetrie noticed in an old photograph of Pankhurst that she wore a long jacket reminiscent of an American preacher’s robe, and she sought to recreate it for the film. \nThe Pankhurst character has very little screen time “to make an impression on the audience,” Petrie said, “so I wanted it to be a very clear, straightforward image. The minute you see her, and she raises her arms, you can see the long sleeves of the robe. There’s almost a studiousness to them, a respect. You know that she’s there with something to say. She’s ready to preach and inspire the admiration of the crowd.” Helena Bonham Carter in the film “Suffragette.” (Steffan Hill/Focus Features via The New York Times)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:51:40.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
