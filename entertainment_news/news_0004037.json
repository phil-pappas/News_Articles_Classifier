I was, like 115 pounds. Then when I filmed a movie last summer, I actually went under 100 pounds. It was crazy, but things have leveled out, and I'm back to normal.\"\nThe actress said although her fluctuating look prompted insecurity, she is thankful for her family and friends for being her support. \"I knew that the people around me had my back,\" she explained. \"Now I really empathize with people who have issues with their skin, because it can get you down.\"\nSay hello to our November #HealthCoverStar, @victoriajustice!
