Behind them Helen George and Aljaz Skorjanec, Jamelia and Tristan MacManus, Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton, and Peter Andre and Janette Manrara all scored 32 out of 40. \nTomorrow night another couple will be leaving the competition and we think that Jeremy Vine and Karen Clifton, and Kirsty Gallacher and Brendan Cole should be feeling a little bit worried. \nThe leaderboard for the evening was: \nKatie Derham and Anton Du Beke – 33 Helen George and Aljaž Skorjanec – 32 Jamelia and Tristian MacManus – 32 Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton – 32 Peter Andre and Janette Manrara – 32 Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice – 31 Anita Rani and Gleb Savchenko – 27 Ainsley Harriott and Natalie Lowe – 26 Jay McGuiness and Aliona Vilani – 25 Daniel O’Donnell and Kristina Rihanoff – 23 Carol Kirkwood and Pasha Kovalev – 22 Kirsty Gallacher and Brendan Cole – 21 Jeremy Vine and Karen Clifton – 20 \nStrictly Come Dancing 2015 continues tomorrow night at 7.15pm.
