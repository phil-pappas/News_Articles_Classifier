Mia Dyson will support The Waifs at their upcoming concert at Music Botanica. PICTURE: JENNIE WARREN Source: Supplied \nBEING the support act on somebody else’s national tour may not have the status, but it does have its advantages, according to Mia Dyson. \nThe musician has forged an impressive career of her own, picking up an ARIA Award for her efforts and last year being anointed the Double J Artist of the Year. \nSo Dyson is hardly the up-and-coming artist one might expect to join a big-name band on their tour. \nBut ahead of her gig supporting The Waifs at their sold-out Music Botanica engagement in Cairns on Sunday, she seemed to be pretty happy to have found herself in that role. \n“I love the no-pressure thing. I feel like you’ve got everything to gain and nothing to lose,” she said of not being the headliner. \n“You’re playing in front of someone else’s audience and with a bit of luck you can win some people over.” \nDyson has known The Waifs for about a decade. (“They’re such lovely people ... and such a hoot to hang out with.”) She said that wanting to tour and knowing The Waifs had their new album Beautiful You on the horizon, she approached them with a question. \n“I was like, ‘Hey, have you got a opener? Do you reckon I could join your tour?’” \nThe rest, of course, is history. \nDyson’s upcoming 2016 EP featuring the song Tearing up the Lawn will showcase a new writing partnership between the musician and her husband Karl Linder. \n“He’s quite a wordsmith,” she said. \n“Even though he’s never been a songwriter before, we just started writing together and found this incredible kind of musical union there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:37:47.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
