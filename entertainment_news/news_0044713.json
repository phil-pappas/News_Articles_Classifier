There wasn’t a grand meeting for Hroniss Grasu . He wasn’t called into coach John Fox’s office and informed he would be the starting center in the days following Will Montgomery’s broken left leg. The team sent the only message needed to Grasu when they lined him up with the first unit in practice.\nHere you go, rookie, you’re up.\nMatt Forte, Hroniss Grasu, Charles Leno Charlie Riedel / AP Matt Forte celebrates with Hroniss Grasu (55) and Charles Leno after his game-winning touchdown.\nMatt Forte celebrates with Hroniss Grasu (55) and Charles Leno after his game-winning touchdown.\n(Charlie Riedel / AP) “That was the plan going in early in the week but it was kind of contingent on how he did throughout the week,” left guard Matt Slauson said.\nGrasu did so well that Slauson didn’t take a single rep at center the entire week giving you an indication of how the coaches evaluated the third-round draft pick from Oregon. They didn’t go into the game against the talented Chiefs’ front seven expecting him to be flawless. But the belief was Grasu could go out and function. He did allow the Jaye Howard sack that resulted in a touchdown on a Jay Cutler fumble was a rough play on the second series. Kansas City ran a stunt and Grasu didn’t anchor and got pushed back by Howard. Cutler should have held onto the ball but there was a bit of a jailbreak inside.\n“It was a great call by them,” Grasu said. “We had guys picked up besides one guy that just came through. It was a really good call by them. The only thing we could do about it was get up and move on. That’s what we did. We kept fighting. We kept chopping wood.”\nI asked Slauson if he sat down with Grasu and talked to him after the defensive touchdown staked Kansas City to an early 7-0 lead.\n“No,” he said. “We were good. It was a stunt that we knew they were going to run and when they ran it we had it almost picked up. The problem is they added a new wrinkle to it. It was an extra pick that they hadn’t showed. It was an extra back side pick and then the loop coming around from the strong side went farther around another pick. So that was a new wrinkle that we weren’t ready for and the thing about it is, it’s just a great stunt. That is one of the best stunts I have ever seen. We came off on the sideline, we looked it, we adjusted, nobody panicked. We’ve got to do a better job here, here and here, this is how we do it. OK. Move on. Let’s go.\n“Hroniss did really good. He balled. He played confident. For your first start to see a guy like (Chiefs nose tackle Dontari) Poe and in a stadium like this on the road, I thought he did great.”\nHroniss Grasu Chris Sweda / TNS Hroniss Grasu (55) can't stop the Chiefs from forcing Jay Cutler to fumble near the end zone for a touchdown.\nHroniss Grasu (55) can't stop the Chiefs from forcing Jay Cutler to fumble near the end zone for a touchdown.\n(Chris Sweda / TNS) Grasu said he wasn’t particularly nervous for the opportunity after being inactive during the first four weeks of the season.\n“Going in I told myself to just treat it like practice,” he said. “I did that my whole career at Oregon and it helped me out, just trust your training, your preparation and trust the process of what the coaches are doing here. The greatest thing about that game was no one ever panicked. No one flinched. For a group like this O-line, working such a short amount of time together, it’s even more impressive what our coaches could do to get us ready and what the older guys can do to help.”\nCome on. No nerves at all?\n“No,” he said. “I am just a calm guy. You just trust yourself and you don’t let pressure get to you. I had a good feeling about it throughout the week. It was a good week of preparation. I was just doing my job.”\nIt’s worth wondering if Slauson would have remained at center this week had his fill-in at left guard, Patrick Omameh, not suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him in practice all week and kept him out of the game. But it’s probably a moot point now because barring struggles like he didn’t have against the Chiefs or an injury, it’s a good bet the job belongs to Grasu. You could see improvement as the game went on as he anchored better and the fastest way for him to grow is to play more.\n2. I think the best thing about Jay Cutler’s game in this early part of the season has been his pocket presence. He hasn’t been rattled and plays haven’t fallen apart when he’s been pressured. In fact, he’s created extra time for receivers to come free from their man or find a soft spot in the zone on many occasions in pretty much every game. You saw it on multiple occasions here where he moved around in the pocket or stepped up in the pocket to make a connection.In fact, that’s really what’s happened on some of the biggest plays for the offense this season. Cutler has had stretches of strong play in the past but with the offensive line in a patchwork state right now, he might be better than he’s ever been in the pocket. Some of the statistics don’t look too good. Of the 30 quarterbacks with at least 100 attempts, his completion percentage of 60.2 ranks 23rd. He’s averaging only 6.6 yards per attempt and that’s lower than you’d like, ranking 22nd out of 30, behind Kirk Cousins and Nick Foles, among others.\nPhotos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler.\nIn Cutler’s defense, he’s been playing with a mix-and-match group of wide receivers as Alshon Jeffery has missed four consecutive games and starter Eddie Royal sat out this game as well. That’s what makes his presence in the pocket even more impressive really. Cutler has been poised while under pressure with some guys running routes for him that should probably run their most meaningful routes for the week as a member of the scout team.\n3. You can’t overstate the performance by the offensive line against a defense with some real threats, including outside linebacker Justin Houston -- one of the very best pass rushers in the league. I’m looking forward to re-watching the game and I suspect it was the finest work to date for right tackle Kyle Long because Houston didn’t make a lot of noise. Charles Leno, in his second start for Jermon Bushrod (concussion/shoulder), looked pretty solid again. That was my initial reaction. Offensive line coach Dave Magazu deserves some props and it’s a shame that coach John Fox’s policy is to keep position coaches off-limits to the media for the majority of the season.\n“Sometimes it takes time to either find the right group you want together and sometimes things like this happen where you lose a guy or you lose two guys and you have to try to figure out a way to get everybody on the same page very quickly,” offensive coordinator Adam Gase said in preparation for the Chiefs. “The good thing is with what Dave has done as far as repping guys starting in OTAs, this is not unfamiliar territory for anybody so at some point guys have practiced with each other. It might not be that five or whatever we’re going to end up doing but combinations may have worked together at some point. So it’s not as big of a freak out as people want to make it. It’s more of just getting guys comfortable through the week. That is why we say it is a one-week season all the time. You have all week to get ready and you have time to get ready. Does it take some time to get used to how certain guys may do things together? Yeah. It comes quickly.”\nKyle Long Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune Kyle Long has a conversation on the sideline in the third quarter at Arrowhead Stadium.\nKyle Long has a conversation on the sideline in the third quarter at Arrowhead Stadium.\n(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) Gase said that Long has been very hard on himself in the transition to right tackle from right guard but pointed out he played two games with a cast in his right hand and that he’s handled some tough opponents. He’s also been encouraged by Leno.\n“Chuck had limited exposure in that preseason game (at Cincinnati),” Gase said. “Everyone wanted to be so negative about him. That’s why I said it’s preseason and it’s so early and to just jump on that and say, ‘That’s my evaluation.’ We’re talking about guys that get evaluated over the course of years, not 30 snaps.”\nWe’ll see what kind of update the club offers up on Bushrod this coming week. The bye might be arriving at the right time for him.\n4. No. 2 running back Jacquizz Rodgers had his right arm in what looked like a cast and it was in a sling as well after the game, a bad sign for the veteran who left the game with what was announced as an elbow injury. That might mean a little more work for rookie fourth-round draft pick Jeremy Langford, who had two carries and one reception for 14 yards.\nLangford could get a little more playing time if Rodgers is out but don’t look for a substantial jump. Langford scored a touchdown in the Week 2 loss to the Cardinals on the final play of an 11-snap drive. He was on the field for all 11 plays but didn’t get any offensive action the next week at Seattle and then only had three snaps last week against the Raiders.\nYes, the plan has been to play Langford a little bit more but it’s not quite that simple.\nJeremy Langford Charlie Riedel / AP Jeremy Langford is stopped by the Chiefs' Eric Berry and Derrick Johnson in the first half.\nJeremy Langford is stopped by the Chiefs' Eric Berry and Derrick Johnson in the first half.\n(Charlie Riedel / AP) “Couple times it has been personnel groupings, trying to mix him in there and it didn’t quite go the way we wanted as far as getting what we needed from the other side,” offensive coordinator Adam Gase said. “It’s trying to find some time to be able to make sure Matt (Forte) is not taking every rep the entire game and it is more because Matt needs to be a stud in the third and fourth quarter.”\n5. Christian Jones was asked to call the defensive signals when Shea McClellin went out with a knee injury on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter. After the first series, the equipment staff popped the speaker into Jones’ helmet.\n“It’s muffled and it’s fuzzy so it’s hard to hear,” Jones said.\nSo, Jones asked the coaches to signal the plays in from the sideline as well and that way he could ensure what he thought he was hearing was what defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was dialing up from the coaches’ booth.\n“Once the game kept going, I felt more comfortable doing that,” said Jones, who had never called defensive signals at Florida State or in high school. “They just never had me do it before.”\nOutside linebacker Pernell McPhee have a thumbs up for Jones’ work as a fill-in.\nChristian Jones Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune Christian Jones breaks up a pass intended for Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce in the fourth quarter.\nChristian Jones breaks up a pass intended for Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce in the fourth quarter.\n(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) “Awesome,” McPhee said. “He didn’t miss a beat. He was on point with everything. I hope my boy Shea can get healthy because he is our general of the defense.”\nLaRoy Reynolds, signed Sept. 29 with a goal of having him help on special teams, was pushed into service on defense in the base package. It’s the first time he’s ever played in a 3-4 scheme so he’s learning on the fly.\n“We’ve got a pretty good group and the guys were helping me on the sideline,” he said. “They were helping me with a lot of the calls. It’s still a learning process for me but this was a good opportunity to get out there and help the team.”\n6. I am interested to see how the Bears choose to match up against Lions receiver Calvin Johnson next week at Detroit. They asked Kyle Fuller to shadow him from side to side last season but that was a decision driven primarily by the fact that Option No. 2 was 5-foot-8 Tim Jennings. The Bears have taller cornerbacks now with Fuller (5-11), Alan Ball (6-2) and Tracy Porter (5-11). Porter, of course, was the one that drew the assignment to follow Oakland’s Amari Cooper in Week 4. Interestingly, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said it was not something he’s done a lot in the past.\nIn a perfect world, a defensive coordinator has a cornerback on each side with good size and terrific athletic ability. But cornerbacks are not created alike and there is a lot that goes into it. A lot of it depends on what coverages being used. The Bears have been playing a lot of Cover 3 with some Cover 4 (quarters) and Cover 1 mixed in. Generally speaking, coaches will want smaller defensive backs to play up closer to the line of scrimmage to take away underneath stuff and the quick timing routes and the better point of attack or defenders with length, you prefer them to handle the deeper shots downfield. If you’re talking about straight man to man coverage though, it’s size for size, length vs. length and catch radius vs. defending radius.\n7. With each passing week the number of questions about wide receiver Alshon Jeffery’s status only multiply. Jeffery sat out his fourth consecutive game with a hamstring injury. If there is an upside to him sitting this coming week at Detroit (I don’t know if there is ever an upside to a player not playing), it’s that the Bears have a bye the following week meaning he could get even more time to ensure his body is ready for the rigors of the season.\nJeffery has had two full practices since Aug. 11 and that’s two months now. Remember, it was a calf muscle injury that kept him out of all of the preseason. You have to figure he’s going to need at least two full practices and maybe more before they cut him loose in a game and he was held out last Friday and was limited before that. The goal is to get him back on the field as soon as possible but one more muscle injury and you could talk about half of the season being gone.\n8. Before Pat O’Donnell was held out of the Raiders game in Week 4, there were questions about whether or not the Bears would consider using him on kickoffs as well, or at least see if he could handle double duty. Robbie Gould has nine touchbacks through five games although the Bears have not kicked off nearly as much as some other teams that have scored more. His touchback percentage is 39.2 but you should also recall he was instructed to pop up some kickoffs against Oakland.\nFacing former Bears special teams coordinator Dave Toub, special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers instructed Gould to mix it up with some pooch kicks and regular kickoffs, three of which were touchbacks.\nNow that O’Donnell has returned from his sprained right knee, is double duty even a consideration? O’Donnell kicked off at the University of Cincinnati and Miami in college. At Miami in 2013, O’Donnell had 79 kickoffs averaging 63.1 yards with 37 touchbacks and two out of bounds. He totaled 43 touchbacks on 136 kickoffs in 2011 and 2012 at Cincinnati.\n“I know when I evaluated him coming out of Miami (for the 2014 draft), that was part of the evaluation,” Rodgers said. “He did enough to get an evaluation. He has done some of those things in practice. He’s got some background in that.”\nBut Rodgers makes the clear point it’s two distinctly different jobs.\n“I don’t think it is natural as say a sam linebacker learning to play mike,” he said. “Those are very like type skills. The punt and kickoff, the only thing that is in common is the ball is hitting your foot. It is a totally different leg swing. You’re using different muscles. It takes practice. It’s not like you just roll it out there and kick the ball off the tee. There is a little more to it than that.\n“Robbie is going to kick off for us. We will continue to ask different guys to do different things across the roster but that is not something we feel like is in our best interest right now.”\nGould has also been in the best interest for the team with field goals. He’s 11 for 11 now with field goals and passed Kevin Butler for the franchise’s all-time scoring mark.\nGould is currently at 1,118 points. His 11 field goals this season are two more than he made in all of 2014. Gould opened the 2012 and 2013 seasons by making his first 11 field goals. He made his first 13 tries in 2011 but his best year was in 2006 when he opened the year with a franchise record 24 consecutive field goals before missing a 45-yarder at New England in Week 12.\n9. Kickers test out their range in pregame and Kansas City kicker Cairo Santo s said his outer limit on Sunday was 57 or 58 yards based on his work in pregame. So, count Santos among those that were surely surprised when coach Andy Reid called on him to attempt a 66-yard field goal with two seconds remaining. We’re not in Denver, Andy. Santos said he hit one field goal from 65 yards in training camp and has hit from 67 at Arrowhead in the past during practice and with the wind. His attempt was way short and right.\n“I knew it was outside my range but we had to give it a chance, given the circumstances,” Santos said. “So we tried our best.”\nMaybe a Hail Mary works better there. Low percentage? No question. But there’s always the possibility of a defensive penalty as well and Alex Smith could get the ball to the end zone from midfield. I’m not saying Reid cost the Chiefs the game there but a 66-yarder when you’re not in the thin air of Denver seems like a reach.\n10. Got a lot of complaints via Twitter that the touchdown when quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled and Ramik Wilson recovered in the end zone for the Chiefs was blown by the officials. Most of the complaints said the play should have been blown dead because the ball was not in the end zone when Cutler was first hit. That’s true. But the ball came out before Cutler went to the ground and when the ball popped out, it very much was in the end zone. I believe that play was correctly ruled. As far as the controversial replay review of Marc Mariani’s attempt to get to the goalline on the 2-point conversion, I don’t know that there was indisputable evidence to overturn it. There didn’t seem to be a perfect angle that was clear. Bottom line there is the receiver needs to be in the end zone or be able to clearly cross the goalline.\n10a. Strong safety Antrel Rolle , who was held out to miss a game for the first time since his rookie season in 2005 with the Arizona Cardinals, was not wearing the walking boot he was outfitted with last week for his right ankle. I asked him if he had a high ankle sprain and Rolle replied, “I’m taking it day by day.” Rolle was listed as doubtful for the game and he did not participate in practice last week. We’ll see what his status is like come Wednesday.\n10b. Be interesting to see what coaches come up with in film review for tackles. Safety Adrian Amos was credited with only two tackles in press box statistics.\n10c. Might not have been a better defensive play for the Bears in the game than the pass breakup Tracy Porter had on the quick slant to Jeremy Maclin with just more than two minutes to play. The Bears don’t have a defensive back playing with more confidence than Porter right now and that’s why he makes the most plays on the ball.\n10d. The Bears’ pass defense ranks third in the NFL allowing 185.8 yards per game. The opponent passer rating is 28th though at 105.8.\n10e. Would be remiss if I didn’t mention another solid outing for Marquess Wilson . Two big pass interference calls for him the last two games and some clutch catches. Great job of tracking Jay Cutler’s pass on the touchdown.\n10f. The Bears brought in punter Michael Palardy for a tryout last Friday and it’s not because they were concerned Pat O’Donnell knee would be an issue again. The bet here is they used Palardy, who punts with his left foot, to prepare returner Marc Mariani for talented Chiefs punter Dustin Colquitt, also a lefty. It’s not uncommon for teams to bring in a left-footed kicker to help prepare their returners. Palardy was a kicker and punter at Tennessee and has spent time with the St. Louis Rams and Oakland Raiders. Some believe that left-footed punters produce more muffs but you’ll have a hard time convincing special teams coordinators of that.\n10g. Fox has assigned the crew of Chris Myers, Ronde Barber and Jennifer Hale to work Sunday’s game against the Lions from Ford Field.\n10h. The 0-5 Lions opened as a 3-point favorite over the Bears for Sunday’s game at Ford Field.\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Jay Cutler Kansas City Chiefs Hroniss Grasu Robbie Gould John Fox Detroit Lions", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb80c/turbine/chi-alshon-jeffery-chicago-bears-photos-012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb8d4/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-10-thoughts-biggs-20151012-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb8da/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-10-thoughts-biggs-20151012-004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56003aef/turbine/chi-alshon-jeffery-chicago-bears-photos", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bcfb3/turbine/chi-cutler-ct0031643628-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb951/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-10-thoughts-biggs-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb8d6/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-10-thoughts-biggs-20151012-006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb7cb/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb8e0/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-10-thoughts-biggs-20151012-005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb8dd/turbine/ct-bears-chiefs-10-thoughts-biggs-20151012-003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb7cc/turbine/chi-cutler-wre0031641930-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56003af7/turbine/chi-alshon-jeffery-chicago-bears-photos-011"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:24:25.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
