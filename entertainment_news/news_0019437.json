The event will support the REMIX Project , a nonprofit dedicated to improving creative education opportunities for underprivileged youth.\nFormed by some of Chicago’s brightest young business leaders, the Chicago Leadership Alliance (CLA) seeks to spread knowledge of the city’s nonprofit space. By raising funds for REMIX, the CLA is furthering its mission to leverage the talents of Chicago’s brightest young leaders to improve the city in which they live and work.\nAccording to Corey Jenkins, Director of Programming at The REMIX Project, the nonprofit envisions that the event will create both awareness and support for the growing creative community.\n“Our participants are extremely talented, and they’re not given the opportunity to grow in the communities they reside in,” Jenkins said. “The REMIX Project is designed to harness the talents of these individuals and help improve their skills. Because CLA has such a strong influence in the Chicago community, their support is critical in spreading awareness of our mission.”\nFrom musical performances, a live art demonstration and interactive displays of the participants' work the night will be centered on showcasing the students’ creative work. This will include several on-stage vocal/rap performances, an art gallery, and an in-house DJ showcasing the work of REMIX producers. Event attendees will also be able to bid on and purchase the art and photography.\n“Our team is proud to work with a unique organization like The REMIX Project,” said Ashley Wood, social chair of the Chicago Leadership Alliance. “As leaders of the Chicago community, we understand the importance in investing in the city’s next generation of creative leadership. Because The REMIX Project is striving to help young, creative individuals build their talents, they are the perfect match for CLA.”\nThe event will include several open bars and heavy appetizers themed around Chicago neighborhoods. Cocktail attire is preferred.
