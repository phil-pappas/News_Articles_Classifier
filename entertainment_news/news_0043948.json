The collection takes inspiration from India's resplendent architecture, which is famously seen in the Taj Mahal. Arches, domes and elaborate stone inlay patterns find their way into this exclusive jewellery collection.\n\"I have a passion for jewellery and jewellery styling! It's a real energy boost to select and mix jewellery pieces every morning for the look of the day and its different situations -work meetings, lunch with friends, a fashion event, a formal dinner. I want to share this passion and help consumers feel comfortable and confident about styling jewellery that fits the season's trends and each woman's style,\" said Nathalie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:53:27.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
