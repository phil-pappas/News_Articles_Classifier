She explains how you can connect with your inner being and send healing messages to yourself and to others with a technique called theta patterning. One can also project into theta a vision held for one’s own life or for a larger organization, she said. \nIn 1990, Dr. Jonas Salk told Eaton that she was a visionary and that she can “hold the vision so that other people can walk into it.” She is offering classes on “holding the vision.” “Going Deep: My Transcendent Journey into Theta Consciousness” is available through Amazon; at the Belfast Co-Op and Coyote Moon in Belfast; and through the author. For more information about classes or to arrange for a signed copy, call Eaton at 338-1424 or email thetapatterning@gmail.com. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
