For more than 30 years, AQS has been the leading voice in quilting inspiration and advice, through a broad suite of products—magazines, books, live events, contests, workshops, online networks, patterns, fabric, and catalogs. At AQS, we believe that with inspiration and advice, the creatively-minded individual can take their quilting projects beyond what even they had imagined. The leading authors in quilting choose to publish with AQS; the best in quilt artistry select AQS events to display their work; the newest quilters learn from the knowledge and inspiration of AQS members.
