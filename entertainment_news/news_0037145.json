The brand new figure was officially launched by the attraction at a VIP celebration at DC's The Loft at 600 F. The event was inspired by Efron's latest film, We Are Your Friends-- where he plays an aspiring Hollywood DJ.\n\"We are thrilled to introduce a brand new figure of Zac Efron to the legendary line-up at Madame Tussauds,\" said Therese Alvich , Regional Manager Madame Tussauds Washington DC. \"Zac has continued to gain popularity and is beloved by his fans. We are so happy to offer our visitors the chance to get up close to one of their favorite celebrities.\"\nThis is Zac Efron's second Madame Tussauds figure and will be the first to visit Washington DC . In 2009, Zac's inaugural figure was unveiled in London . His newest figure required over 250 precise measurements to capture each detail and was hand-sculpted by a team of 20 Studio Artists. The Madame Tussauds team referenced countless images and videos, creating a more mature and sophisticated Efron. The heartthrob is dressed to impress, styled in a grey fitted suit, perfectly capturing his effortless contemporary yet laidback style.\nOne lucky fan helped wish the star a happy birthday at the DJ'd celebration thanks to Girls' Life Magazine . This past August, the popular magazine for teen girls held an exclusive contest at their Annual Fashion Bash, providing fans with the chance to win tickets to attend the once in a lifetime opportunity to celebrate with the celebrity.\nMadame Tussauds is excited to spread the word via social media channels using #MTDCEfron.
