Merwin , Robert Bly ), appeared on PBS with Bill Moyers , and won many important awards.\nMore Information Famous\nPoem by Naomi Shihab Nye\nIllustrations by Lisa Desimini\nWings Press, $15.95\nBut I knew her before the first chapbooks in the mid-’70s, before she added Nye to Shihab — when she was still singing her songs about chickens.\nThere have always been two Naomis — the poet writing about injustice and the author of books for kids and young adults.\nIn both cases, it is serious work and not that different.\nThe adult poetry concerns the startling insights of everyday moments, and the books for kids reflect a childlike sense of wonder. The reverse is also true.\nThe opening line of “Famous” — included in her adult book, “Hugging the Jukebox,” winner of the National Poetry Series — is simple enough: “The river is famous to the fish.”\nIt begins big — with water — for without it, nothing lives. It ends with the buttonhole — “not because it did anything spectacular, but because it never forgot what it could do.”\nThat’s some journey from the element that takes up more than 70 percent of our planet to the human invention that we take for granted.\nThat’s also the range of her work, from “Jukebox” (1982) to more significant titles, like “19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems from the Middle East” (2002), a finalist for the National Book Award, to Naomi’s strongest, most heartbreaking book, “Transfer” (2011), about the loss of her father Aziz Shihab .\nDuring those two decades there have been a half dozen poetry books, novels and poems (mostly for younger readers), plus several anthologies.\nAll this time, Naomi has been traveling and teaching throughout the United States and in many countries. She has been prolific and became “famous” in our literary culture.\nThe artist Lisa Desimini is also “famous” in the world of kids’ books, creating the art for 30 titles, including several with her own texts. But the artwork and the poem keep the creators in the wings, while their charmingly ironic take on the idea of fame becomes a bright yellow star coming through opened curtains on center stage. And that’s just the dust jacket!\nThroughout the poem, there are brightly colored equivalents to the images; but also additional visuals, like the magazine rack where Desimini plays a clever game with fame, including “How to spend your 15 minutes!”\nHowever the book is not only for kids. The intention of the artists is, according to Naomi: “Lisa and I imagine ‘Famous’ as a possible gift book for people of all ages. People who have been famous to us, whom we wish to encourage, who are at the crossroads, who are graduating, who are nervous about the future, and who want to be more or other than they are.”\nIt was designed by Bryce Milligan , who has written and reviewed such books, and it is one of the most beautiful publications brought out under his Wings imprint, which has published an incredible diversity of multicultural titles.\nEven our most cynical masks will fall off in the wake of this absolutely delightful and charmed collaboration.\nRoberto Bonazzi ’s “Outside the Margins,” a collection of literary commentaries, has just been published by Wings Press.
