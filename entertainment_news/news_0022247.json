They helped put the first three Calder Cup banners in the rafters. They helped turn the Amerks crest into one of the most recognizable logos in pro hockey. Once inside the building, ties to the franchise past continued. Yes, this is a new year, a new team, a new outlook. But the first 59 years won't be forgotten.\nFlora Allen made a return to sing the national anthem. She was a staple of Amerks hockey in the 1980s and 1990s. When she belted out the Star Spangled Banner with her unique blend of fervor and reverence, it brought chills and cheers before every game.\nWhen the late John D'Amico was in town as an officials' supervisor, he would always say that Allen's rendition of the Star Spangled Banner was the best he'd ever heard. Having worked more than 2,000 NHL games as a linesman, D'Amico knew a little about anthem singers, too.\nAs the lights came back on Friday following the anthem, greats of the past emerged for the ceremonial puck drop. There was an Amerks Hall of Famer for each decade: Joe Crozier for the 1950s, Dick Gamble for the '60s, Doug Gibson for the '70s, Jody Gage for the 80s, Wendy Charron to represent her late husband, Craig, for the '90s, and Chris Taylor for the 2000s. Current captain Cal O'Reilly joined them.\nCrozier coached the Amerks in 1983-84, when Randy Cunneyworth was a third-year pro. Now Cunneyworth is again coaching the Amerks, his ninth season behind bench but his first here since 2007-08.\n\"It was nice to see (Crozier) again, he looked good,\" Cunneyworth said. \"Seeing those legends out there was a bit of an inspiration for these guys.\"\nSaid Matt Ellis, who scored three goals in the 6-3 victory over the Lake Erie Monsters: \"With a lot of the Hall of Famers here, people that have been champions, it was extra special.\"\nThe night became very special for Ellis, too. He hadn't had a hat trick since the 2007 Calder Cup playoffs against the Manitoba Moose. He was playing for the Grand Rapids Griffins. It was the fifth season of what is now a 14-year pro career.\n\"I haven't had many so I definitely remember them,\" he said with a big smile.\nHis rookie linemate, Jean Dupuy, certainly enjoyed the night. He assisted on the three goals.\n\"He was great,\" Ellis said. \"It was a pleasure to play with him, to be honest with you.\"\nThe most meaningful performance may have come from goalie Nathan Lieuwen, however.\nHe stopped 35 shots and was very sound in a difficult game for a goalie. There were breakdowns, there were scrambles and there were giveaways. But as the last line of defense, he bailed out his teammates often.\nBuy Photo Amerks goalie Nathan Lieuwen denied Markus Hannikainen on a breakaway just 1:51 into the first period.

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nAnd he reaffirmed, not so much to himself but to the hockey world, that he's back, that's healthy, and that's he's still an NHL prospect.\nLieuwen hadn't played a real game since Dec. 19. Lingering concussion issues were causing him vision problems and the organization shut him down in January.\nThey weren't sure what they'd see when training camp began, so he was eased back into action. He played the third period of two NHL preseason games. \"Baby steps,\" Cunneyworth termed it. \"And I think that was the right way to do it.\"\nHe then played all three periods of the Oct. 3 Amerks preseason game at Binghamton, a 6-2 victory.\nOn Friday, in a game that mattered, he looked like the Lieuwen who was among the AHL's best in 2013-14. That year he had the fourth-best save percentage (.922) and eighth-best goals-against average (2.34) in the league.\nHe has always taken pride in being able to make the important save, the one that swings momentum. He made several of them on Friday.\n\"There's the pivotal moment in a game when there needs to be a save made,\" he said. \"Not necessarily a miraculous save, but just a timely save. To get that back tonight is rewarding.\"\nHe should be getting another reward on Saturday: a promotion.\nThe Sabres need a goalie because Robin Lehner is hurt. There's little doubt that Lieuwen will be backing up Chad Johnson when the Sabres play the Tampa Bay Lightning at 1:05 p.m. Saturday in Buffalo.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/10/Rochester/Rochester/635800330872548100-lieuwen-save.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce59334bc8f2b42eb282b32c80cb81c5fa77a5a8/c=0-143-2594-1609&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/10/Rochester/Rochester/635800330872548100-lieuwen-save.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:04:27.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
