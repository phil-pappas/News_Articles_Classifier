But the fights in her upcoming release Ganga, she says, were taxing even for a seasoned veteran like her. \"There are several fights in the film â€” an introduction sequence shot over 10 days in a location near the international airport, another at a timber factory, and, of course, the climax sequence, which was an unforgettable experience,\" says Malashree.\nThe climax, which has three shades, was shot over 18 days and included the entire cast, as well as nearly 40-45 stuntmen. \"Much of the sequence was shot underwater, for which we used a huge tank. The team did try to heat the water, but given the size of the tank, that was just impossible in the time frame we had. So we shot in cold water that not only had me shivering, but also made it difficult to breathe. After every shot, I was literally in tears, but the end product has come out well, so it was worth all the effort,\" says the actress, who will also be seen fighting baddies amid 15-20 horses as part of this scene.
