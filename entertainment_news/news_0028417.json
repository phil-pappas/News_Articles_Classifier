Courvoisier replaced the first president of WoVO – Dustin Ebaugh – earlier this year. “Without Dustin’s guidance and steadfast adherence to strong principles, this growth never would’ve happened,” said Courvoisier.\nWoVO advocates for the voice acting profession. The association promotes, educates, mentors, and generally represents the needs of voice talent in the marketplace. WoVO accepts union and non-union members, and qualifies all applicants into either an “associate” or “professional” membership category. The qualification is based on a vetting of the applicant’s work history, and is voted on by an Executive Board of 10 officers.\nWorld-Voices Organization, Inc. recently launched a technical certification standard for its professional members who wish to establish their status as a knowledgeable audio technician.\nAlso, WoVO is actively promoting its new online directory that lists all its professional members, their profile, and their demos. VoiceOver.biz asserts on the website: “All the voices you needand all proven pros.” People looking for voice actors for their projects can peruse the listings, request auditions from talent they choose to hear, and hire for their projects, all at no cost. WoVO members in the professional category enjoy the exposure on this site as a bonus of their membership.\nWoVO creates online communities of members and prospective members in Facebook Groups , a LinkedIn Group , during bi-monthly #WoVOChats, international virtual meetup groups, monthly newslettters, and an annual Conference (WoVOCon), usually held in Las Vegas in April.\nWoVO was founded by board members Ebaugh, Courvoisier, Chris Mezzolesta, and Dan Lenard. Other board members include Peter Bishop, Randye Kaye, Brad Venable, Elizabeth Holmes, Katherin Vasilopoulos, Pam Lorence, and Karyn O’Bryant. A 5th founder, Atty Robert Sciglimpaglia, is the organization’s counsel, but does not participate in board votes.\nWoVO has international members representing all continents except Antarctica (for now).\nVoice actors interested in joining this vibrant world-wide community of voice actors can enroll for a one-time $25 application fee, and an annual $49 membership fee by visiting the World-Voices Organization, Inc. website.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10WOVO/prweb12990434.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=4422336", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10WOVO/prweb12990434.htm", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/353341054723209/"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:27:02.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
