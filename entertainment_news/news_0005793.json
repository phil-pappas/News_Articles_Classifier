Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd. Pop music sounds like a middle-schooler-on-Nickelodeon's parents left the house for the weekend.\nGranted, when you hear the name UB40 (performing Friday at the Hard Rock Hotel), you recall feel-good reggae-pop classics \"Red Red Wine,\" \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" and \"Here I Am.\"\nBut Astro and his British mates have addressed British imperialism and the Ethiopian famine, with a dance beat. The name UB40 is an ode to British welfare: \"Unemployment Benefit Form 40.\"\n\"As far as I can see, it's only reggae artists addressing social issues,\" Astro says.\n\"I think all the other artists are so intertwined by corporations, they wouldn't dream of saying anything vaguely political, for fear of losing their franchises.\"\nAstro is generally correct. Many musicians hand over their social courage badges to multinational conglomerate executives looking to hype up nonthreatening tent pole acts.\nWe have found out what happens when musicians en masse want to be stars without enemies. Booty songs. Ah, yes, we all love a good booty. It's big. It's round. It's a booty.\nTo be fair, some stars are exceptionally outspoken and lead by example, from Miley Cyrus to Demi Lovato to, um, who am I forgetting?\nAstro files a surprising addendum to his complaint. He doesn't think political music actually changes the world.\n\"That's been proved time and time again. If music could change the world, then Bob Dylan would have single-handedly stopped the Vietnam War,\" Astro says.\nThis is where I disagree. Political music takes time, time, time to turn the leaves. The hippies, playing music in the sails, won great victories against staggeringly repugnant political cruisers. Later, Madonna alone popularized liberated female sexuality via sociopolitical videos and songs — during the Apartheid-Reagan years, no less. How less interesting would America be if she had never strutted her proto \"slut walk\"?\nIf nothing else, political songs help like-minded listeners feel less alone in their ideals, with the added bonus of making political opponents slurp up grump sauce.\n\"At least you know other people are thinking and feeling the same as you, around the world. That's a comforting feeling, to know you are not on your own,\" Astro said.\nSo here's Astro's plea to pop-minded musicians everywhere: Put aside your \"mundane pop rubbish\" and \"bloodcurdling love songs\" for a moment, and pen a political song.\n\"I think the world is waiting for it,\" he says. \"Life isn't all fun and games. There are more serious things to worry about than your girlfriend's messing about with somebody else.\"\nDoug Elfman can be reached at delfman@reviewjournal.com .
