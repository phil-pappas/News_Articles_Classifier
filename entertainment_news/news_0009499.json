Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained his silence for days, searching for the most inoffensive statement he could make in the light of the incident. Of all the things he said, he backed President Pranab Mukherjee’s words, “We can’t allow the core values of our civilisation to be wasted. The core values are that over the years, civilisation celebrated diversity, promoted and advocated tolerance, enjoyed plurality,” Modi’s public statements can put the most efficient Public Relations manager to shame. But, the question is, does he truly believe in what he says or professes? If India was indeed about celebrating diversity and promoting tolerance, beef wouldn’t have been banned in the first place. Let alone, all that has transpired since the ban. And why just the ban on beef, the temporary ban on porn to safeguard the fabric of ‘Indian culture, books like ‘The Great Soul’ or other movies and documentaries which didn’t show the situation Gujarat in a light that our Prime Minister would’ve liked – have all been forced away from the public. Speaking of tolerance, nine years back, Fanaa was banned because the lead actor of the film Aamir Khan was actively voicing out to save Narmada river.Films like Firaaq and Parzania were about how people who were affected during the Godhra Riots of 2002 go about their lives. But it was shunned away from the people of Gujarat as if the incident never happened. It was quite similar to what happened to BBC’s documentary on the Nirbhaya Rape-Murder case ‘India’s daughter’ in 2015. Speaking on the Dadri lynching incident he said, “Hindus should decide whether to fight Muslims or poverty. Muslims have to decide whether to fight Hindus or poverty. Both need to fight poverty together. The country has to stay united, only communal harmony and brotherhood will take the nation forward. People should ignore controversial statements made by politicians, as they are doing so for political gains.” While he did make a valid point to the people with Indira Gandhi-esque ‘Garibi Hatao’ speech, why did he not criticize the keepers of Hindutva? Why did he keep quiet when members of the Bharaitya Janata Party (BJP) beat up an MLA in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly for organizing a beef party at home? Why has he kept quite to all the atrocities carried out by right-wing members belonging to BJP or its affiliates from venting out their frustration physically or by imposing bans? Isn’t it time for Narendra Modi to step up and first clear the ill-acts of his party members, before sending out fluff in the form of promises of taking care of stopping the ills of the country. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 9:04 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:26.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
