With 48 talented singers chosen for the battle rounds, the pack soon began to narrow down when teams faced off in the ring, performing duets to determine whether or not they were chosen to move onto the next phase of the competition. The first battle pairing of the season pit Team Adam’s Jordan Smith and Regina Love against each other to the Sam Smith hit, Like I Can. While the two vocalists were evenly matched, it was Jordan’s relatability that gave him the edge and made him Adam’s pick to continue on. “His voice is the unicorn. And his ability to connect with people on a human level is just as powerful as his talent, which is very rare,” he said. But it wasn’t long before Gwen Stefani swooped in and stole Regina over to her team. The “ultimate four chair turn battle” then saw Barrett Baber up against Dustin Christensen , who both hailed from Team Blake. The two singers nailed Marc Cohn’s folk rock hit, Walking in Memphis, which prompted Blake to make the difficult choice to stick with Barrett, leaving Dustin open for Adam to steal over to his promising team. The guest mentors return when the battle round continues next week. \nMaksim Chmerkosvkiy is back: \nA “switch-up night” in the ballroom mixed and matched dancing pairs and left some celebrities thriving and others faltering during an eventful week on Dancing with the Stars. Former professional partner and mirrorball champion Maksim Chmerkovskiy returned as a guest judge and couldn’t help notice the undeniable chemistry between one new pair, as Alek Skarlatos and Emma Slater could barely keep their hands off each other during rehearsals. Luckily, their connection translated perfectly onto the ballroom, where the duo delivered one of the steamiest Rumba’s the show has ever season, gaining a 29/40 and pushing Maks to call Alek the “dark horse” of the season. Bindi Irwin and Val Chmerkovskiy pulled out a 37/40 with a lively Cha Cha that the guest judge quickly dubbed “the dance of the night.” But it was Alexa PenaVega and temporary partner, Derek Hough who ruled the week’s leaderboard with a tango that earned them the first perfect score of the season. Thankfully for the newly-formed pairs, there was no elimination, as one couple will be ousted next week based on the past two rounds of dances. \nThe last straw: \n“A lot has changed and you can’t deny that,” Kim Kardashian said, perfectly recapping the season 10 finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which aired with plenty of dramatics this week. First, an emotional Kourtney Kardashian struggled through a tense break-up with long-time boyfriend Scott Disick, when the father of her three kids went on a “crazy bender” and disappeared to France. Once a family friend called Kim, it was revealed that a photo of Scott, cuddling with a brunette stylist, was plastered on the front cover of the Daily Mail. “He took the yacht and the jet and the women and Saint Tropez over Kourtney and the three kids. He just showed his worth,”cousin Cici explained over the phone. A usually strong and stable Kourtney broke down to her sister. “I’ve worked so hard to keep this family together. It just makes me so sad for the kids,” she said. And while one family relationship crumbled, a new one was confirmed when the Kardashian sisters were newly acquainted with their mother, Kris Jenner’s new beau, Corey Gamble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:55:05.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
