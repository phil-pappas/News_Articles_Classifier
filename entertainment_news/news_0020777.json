For a 3-piece band, they pound out a lot of sound! \nA rather small framed Mayberry might be small in stature but has a voice that can move mountains and part seas. Her stage presence is something else as well. Backed up by Cook and Doherty, they make a big sound that not very many bands can match. \nThey hit the ground running and belted out their debut album staples like \"We Sink,\"\"Lies,\" and \"Recover,\" and had plenty of new material like my favorites \"Clearest Blue,\" and \"Leave a Trace.\" It doesn't matter what song you choose off of any of their albums, you'll find there isn't any of them you don't like! \nKeep an eye out for these guys. When you only have 2 albums out and you're filling up a venue like the Fillmore, you know you're doing something right! Keep it up you three, I see a lot of good things coming your way! \n----", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:55:48.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
