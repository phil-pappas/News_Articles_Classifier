A representative for the Grammy winner confirmed the engagement on Friday. \nGreen will release a new album, \"Heart Blanche,\" on Nov. 6. \nThe former \"Voice\" coach said he and James didn't want to promote their engagement. \n\"We're a collective power together because our private life is sacred. But you know ... maybe it is time for the world to know that I have a very secure situation and a loving woman supporting me the entire way,\" he said. \nGreen was previously married to Christina Johnson.
