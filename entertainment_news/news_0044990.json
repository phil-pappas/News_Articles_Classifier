Yes, tickets for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 went on sale today at all of your various online movie ticket outlets. And yes, we have a new poster with allegedly one last mini-trailer debuting in Best Buy stores tomorrow in a Samsung Virtual Reality tie-in. That works, since I may have to make a trip to Best Buy tomorrow anyway so I can multi-task and be somewhat informed when the trailer (presumably) drops online on Monday. But here's the interesting part: While the official national release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 will begin on Thursday, November 19th at 7:00 pm, fans will actually have an opportunity to buy tickets to see an advance 24-hours early presentation of the fourth and final Jennifer Lawrence-as-Katniss Everdeen movie on Wednesday the 18th. The catch? Well, if you call it a catch, you have to sit through The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part I first.It's not unusual for studios to do double/triple features leading up to the premiere of a new installment of a given franchise. Obviously Walt Disney did their eleven-film Marvel movie marathon leading up to the opening night premiere of Avengers: Age of Ultron , and if I recall Lionsgate/Summit did Twilight: Breaking Dawn part I and part II double-features leading up to the film's Thursday night debut. And you can (responsibly) bet that Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. will have Man of Steel / Batman v Superman double-features offered for Thursday March 24th for those willing to see two movies at twice the price.There's nothing wrong with that, and it's the kind of thing I might have indulged in when I was younger (and I could somehow guarantee a packed audience). And the event will feature exclusive onscreen content and giveaways. But this is noticeably different in that those attending the two-fer event will get to see the film a day earlier than everyone else. Also, for what it's worth, and I'm quoting from the press release, fans that purchase tickets via Fandango, MovieTickets, AMC, or Cinemark within the first 24 hours will receive a BONUS copy of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 as a digital download. Additionally Fandango users will receive an exclusive, never-before-seen clip from the upcoming film as well as a personalized, commemorative movie ticket to share online. But yeah, the real news nugget in this press release is that Lions Gate Entertainment is letting the cat out of the bag a full 24 hours early for those willing to splurge for a double-feature. It's not world-changing or anything, but it also means that Lionsgate is clearly not chasing any kind of opening weekend records. I would imagine the ability to see the new movie a day early would encourage far more people to do a double feature (even if they do arrive until the start of the second movie) than would a conventional theatrical double feature which allowed fans to see the movie at around the same time everyone else was.So this may take a slight bite out of the conventional debut weekend numbers and will make comparisons just a little more annoying for box office nerds like myself. But just be aware that anyone who would plunk down the extra cash for a double-feature on a Wednesday would darn-sure be likely to buy a comparative ticket for Thursday night anyway. So yeah, I'm counting the double features sales as part of the weekend bounty when the time comes.The press release, which basically touted the beginning of advance ticket sales, had something of a hidden lede, so I just thought I would highlight it. It's not a huge deal, but I am always in favor of studios finding a way to make the theatrical debut of a major movie into something of an event. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 debuts in American theaters in 2D and IMAX on Wednesday November 18th if you're willing to spend the time and money. For everyone else, it's Thursday the 19th at 7:00 pm. May the odds be ever in its favor.", "external_links": ["http://www.quarterquell.org/2015/09/breaking-mockingjay-part-2-final.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:27:16.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
