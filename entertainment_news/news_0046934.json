The track called \"Can I\" has now resurfaced online after Oliver El-Khatib played its official version in its entirety on OVO Sound Radio over the weekend. On their new collaboration, Queen Bey keeps repeating the phrase \"Can I\" and \"Baby?\" while Drizzy tells her over the slow-tempo clapping beat, \"Before I turn the lights out, tell me who the f**k you wanna be.\" Drake is no stranger to working with Beyonce. The duo previously collaborated on \"Mine\" off the R&B diva's 2013 surprise self-titled album. The former Destiny's Child member was also the inspiration behind the Canadian rapper's 2013 tribute song \"Girls Love Beyonce\". Drake hasn't set an official release date for his \"Views From the 6\" album. However, he's been entertaining fans with new music from last February's \" If You're Reading This It's Too Late \" and last month's \" What a Time to Be Alive \" which is his joint mixtape with Future . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:34:32.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
