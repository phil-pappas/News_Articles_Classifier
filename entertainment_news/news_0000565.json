Here's your chance to cast your vote. For millions of Americans, McDonald's french fries are the gold standard. But maybe you mock that. You say you've been to the mountain and can name dozens of places with immeasurably better fries.\nThat's fine. You can still nominate your favorite independent Northeast Ohio fry spot until 5 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 1, by CLICKING HERE .\nBut among the chains listed below, who does the best job?\nFact is, for a whole lot of people fast-food French fries - served in a bag and thrust out a drive-thru window - are the only fries they really know.\nThere's plenty of hype, of course. McDonald's bills theirs' as \"World Famous Fries.\" Wendy's calls theirs' \"Natural Cut\" (so does Sonic). BK keeps things simple and just calls them fries.\nEndless variations, too. Steak 'n Shake offers a slew of versions of their \"Thin 'n Crispy\" shoestring fries -- cheese, chili cheese, Cajun-seasoned. Chik-fil-A features \"Waffle Potato Fries,\" Hardee's has \"Crispy Curl fries,\" while at Church's Chicken they're called \"Crinkle Cuts.\"\nFans head for Popeye's Louisiana Kitchens for the spicy \"Cajun Fries\" and Arby's for their \"Curly Fries.\" KFC goes the jojo potato route and sells Seasoned Potato Wedges.\nWhich are the best? That's a matter of taste. Express your taste by voting for one of a baker's dozen in the widget below.\nClick here to load this Caspio Online Database .", "external_links": ["http://b2.caspio.com/scripts/e1.js", "http://b2.caspio.com/dp.asp?AppKey=95d31000d3e21c42dc754f979111"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:52:27.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
