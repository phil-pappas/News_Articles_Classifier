The Rockport-based band features three members of the Randolph family (Whitney, Resa and their daughter Emily), joined by Peter Proeller on claw hammer banjo. \n“Pirate” John will kick the evening off at 5 p.m., performing a half hour of spooky tales from Edgar Allan Poe, Washington Irving and Maine native Ruth Moore. Miners Creek will then take to the floor at 5:30 p.m. with a 45-minute set of music. The storyteller will return for a longer performance, and Miners Creek will wind up the show with a second set of music. \nBarnswallow Books is offering the party as a free community event; there will be light fare, yummy cake, coffee and cider. Everyone is invited to come early to browse the curated shelves of old and new books of this honest-to-goodness community bookshop, in the heart of Rockport village. Attendees will want to be dressed warmly and in their seats by the time “Pirate” John takes the barn floor at 5 p.m. \nFor more information about the event, email minerscreekband@gmail.com. Barnswallow’s main bookshop will remain open all year and feature a small café, beginning in mid-November. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
