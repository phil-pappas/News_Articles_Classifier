To help celebrate the American Humane Association’s national Adopt-A-Dog Month, Rochester Animal Services (RAS) and Verona Street Animal Society are offering a 50 percent discount on all dog adoptions during October. This discount was made possible thanks to a Helping Heroes Grant that was awarded to RAS through the Petco Foundation. RAS is the City of Rochester’s animal care and control agency that offers adoptions, spay and neuter services, lost and found programs, volunteer and foster opportunities. The agency provided shelter for almost 2,000 cats and over 2,400 dogs during 2014. They also achieved a save rate of 71.24 percent during that same year. The Verona Street Animal Society, in conjunction with the City of Rochester, helps raise awareness and provides resources that help RAS effectively carry out its mission.\n“The support from Petco Foundation is critical to our efforts to help more people and their pets in Rochester,” said Rochester’s Mayor Lovely A. Warren. “Owning a pet contributes to a better quality of life for all of Rochester’s citizens.”\nAn adoptable dog from RAS/Verona Street Animal Society competes in an agility course.

According to Director Chris Fitzgerald of Rochester Animal Services, an adopted dog can bring multiple benefits to someone’s life. “Whether you want an exercise buddy, a best friend for your child, a partner in agility competitions, a constant companion for an aging parent or simply a fuzzy face to greet you after a hard day at work, an adopted dog can be all of these — and more,” he stated.\nIf you have been thinking about adopting a dog, Fitzgerald says there are several things to take into consideration. First, opening your home to a dog brings with it numerous responsibilities, as they are completely dependent on their owner for all of their needs. Second, the personality and qualities you are looking for are more important than a dog’s appearance and size. For instance, if you live in a smaller apartment, an older shepherd mix may be a better fit than an energetic terrier.\nRAS has dozens of wonderful dogs just waiting to be adopted. You can view adoptable pets at Rochesteranimalservices.com or Vsas.org/adopt . In addition, you can experience an in-person RAS/Verona Street adoption event. The next adoption event is happening on October 18 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at PetSmart, located at 917 Holt Road in Webster.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06d6c9ddf96647b60bf2daa165ceae760bf06eb5/r=500x311/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800129382208770-verona-3.jpg", "http://vsas.org/event/adoption-event-44/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c8e20deaae64cfc403eb5ba8ca28166176c8dfb3/c=82-0-877-598&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800129382208770-verona-3.jpg", "http://Vsas.org/adopt", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635800129382208770-verona-3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:07:46.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
