Compiled by Tony Hicks Posted: 10/19/2015 02:58:52   03:01:14 PM PDT Word on the street is that Madonna and ex-husband Sean Penn are hooking up again. \nWell ... I don't know about the street. But the Internet says so. \nThe stars, who were officially together from 1985 to 1989, have reconciled, according to RadarOnline. \nPenn has been pictured at Madonna concerts twice the past couple months -- most recently on Oct. 14 in Vancouver. He was also at a New York City performance Sept. 17, after which he introduced her to his daughter Dylan Penn. \nMadonna plays SAP Center tonight (Oct. 19), so if you're going, keep an eye out for Penn. Take his picture if you want, he always likes that. \nRadar says Penn plans to join his ex-wife on the road. He's reportedly booked into the same hotel as she is in Vancouver, and will follow her to Los Angeles. An insider told the website there's a chance he could accompany her to Europe later this month. \nWhile playing New York's Barclays Center on Sept. 29, Madonna talked about Penn to the crowd, according to MSN. \n\"I did a show at Madison Square Garden the other night if you heard about it,\" Madonna said. \"And my ex-husband was there! Could you imagine? He had been at my show 30 years earlier when I was at Madison Square Garden, and he was very upset with me for wearing a costume that was too revealing. That's not a lie. Anyway, after the show he wrote me a letter and said he finally appreciates my art. And that is what I have to say about marriage, OK? Thirty (expletive) years later.\" Advertisement \nMadonna plays SAP Center in San Jose tonight (Oct. 19), so if you're going, keep an eye out for Penn.
