The explosions rocked the train station where several unions, civic society organisations and pro-Kurdish People’s Democracy Party were due to hold a rally. \nThe rally aimed to protest conflict between the state and Kurdish militants in southeast Turkey. Hundreds of people gathered at the station when the blasts occurred, private Dogan news agency reported. There were no claims of responsibility for the attack. Witnesses said the first blast took place in front of a train station and the second occurred across the station. \nTurkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan condemned the attack, which he said targeted the unity of the country. The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democracy Party (HDP) leader Selahaddin Demirtas blamed the government for the explosions, saying that it was impossible for the Turkish intelligence to not know about the plot.

However, the health ministry denied the accusations, saying that 55 ambulances were dispatched to the scene and 10 were kept on standby. \nAnkara is set to hold snap elections on November 1 amid increased tension and polarization among major political parties that failed to form a coalition government in June elections. Turkey resumed offensive against the outlawed Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) in late July after two policemen were killed by the terrorist group, apparently in retaliation for a suicide bombing in the Suruc district of southeastern province Sanliurfa on July 20, which killed 34 pro-Kurdish activists and was blamed on the Islamic State (IS). \nViolence has since escalated sharply, with the PKK stepping up attacks on security forces. More than 100 members of Turkish security have been killed in clashes. Hours after the blasts, the PKK called on its fighters to halt activities for a “fair and just election” in Turkey unless they face an attack, a news website close to the organization said. The PKK is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the European Union and the US. \nModified Date: October 11, 2015 3:05 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:11:47.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
