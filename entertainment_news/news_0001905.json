It was just amazing to watch him work.\" \n\"In this movie, Robin's Genie transcends time and space. So does Robin Williams. It's perfect that he played a genie because he's kind of a genius,\" says Musker. \"He was unique because of that lightning-quick improvisational ability and yet always being able to connect to the story.\" YOU MAY ALSO LIKE...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:01:38.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
