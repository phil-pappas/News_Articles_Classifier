News later confirmed ), Chrissy did not take kindly to Instagram commenters offering their opinions also. She retweeted a few folks commenting that she simply must be carrying twins, or even triplets, because she's SO BIG ALREADY etc. etc. but shut that all down with a tweet clarifying that \"I did IVF. One at a time. It isn't twins.\"\n\"I can see the damn thing,\" Chrissy continued, \"get out of my uterus!\" Another good pun would have been \"it's uterUS, not uterALL OF Y'ALL,\" but that might have been too complicated for social media.\nChrissy did later also note that the bumpy ride is \"karma\" of sorts, as she's loved commenting on all her friends' bumps in the past. So there you go.\nFollow Alex on Twitter . â€‹", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/655791796191014912", "https://instagram.com/p/8_CUaFJjd1/", "http://www.eonline.com/news/707692/chrissy-teigen-responds-to-speculation-that-she-s-expecting-twins-or-even-triplets-get-out-of-my-uterus", "http://twitter.com/maybealexislost", "https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/655791165732556800"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:11:00.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
