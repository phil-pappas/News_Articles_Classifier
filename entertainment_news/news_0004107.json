The people have shown that vigor and that decisiveness which lately one only reads of in books about the anti-colonial struggle in which our illustrious forebears kicked out the illegitimate authorities who imposed themselves on their lands.\nThe powers that be deem our #WitsFeesMustFall protest to be out of line, and Wits management keeps circulating e-mails in which they claim that the protestors are a \"minority\" disrupting the desire of 32, 000 others to learn. This is simply not true. Not only is the number of protestors much more than that (lest they would not have been so successful as to cause the entire school to close operations for the entire two days), but also the protestors are marching on behalf of the 30000 or so attendees. What this blunder, this miscalculation shows is our university's appetite for spin, their desire to lie through their teeth - the vilest lies of course have been the attempted justifications for the fee hike.\nThe dispatches which keep being sent show the management's failure to appreciate, or barely even understand, the cause. The people on the street are the signposts of discontent and disenchantment on the part of the great majority of the student population. The fee increment is out of the affordability of many students; the current one was bad enough already. Instead of gesturing us the finger, and telling us we are on our own, the university structures should be doing the best that they can to lobby for funding for students who will be affected by the increment. They should, in other words, do what a university is supposed to do. Only through co-operation between the university, the government and the private sector will students manage to get off the road, get back into the lecture halls and resume their education, knowing that their right to do so will not be curbed by a shortage of money.\nFor this to happen, the university management will have to come to the ground, they will have to be more receptive to the students and what they have to say; this is the agreement we make with the university when it accepts our applications! It is rather sad that we have had to resort to leaving our classrooms and sitting on roads for us to remind the university of that contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:25:36.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
