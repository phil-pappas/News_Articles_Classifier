But she said in a September interview with Alan Cumming on the CBS show \"Remember That Time?\" that those days are over.\n\"That's the good thing about getting older,\" she said. \"You don't have to do that sort of thing anymore. My pleasure pillows are purely for my husband now.\"\nMirren is married to director Taylor Hackford.\nMirren said that despite all the nude and topless scenes she's done over the years, it really wasn't something she was keen on. It just didn't seem to be a big deal, she said.\n\"I never wanted to do that, but you know, I thought, pffft, does it really matter?\" she said.\n\"I was sort of doing nude scenes in the first moment I started doing movies. It was the era.\"\nBut she's always been good-natured about the response.\nIn 2011, she even let \"Saturday Night Live\" send up her \"legendary boobs\" in a skit called \"Helen Mirren's Magical Bosom.\"\nShe said the skit was \"incredibly flattering.\"\n\"Well, I didn't know my boobs were legendary, quite honestly, at that point,\" she told Cumming.", "external_links": ["https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/helen-mirrens-magical-bosom/n12985", "http://www.cbs.com/shows/alan-cumming/video/46148316-90C9-C11D-2706-A2816AFCFE61/helen-mirren-remember-that-time-/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:35:00.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
