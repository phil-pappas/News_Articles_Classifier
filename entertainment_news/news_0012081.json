Handout , Files \nDracula \nOct. 14 to 17, Oct. 21 to 24 | Metro Theatre \nOct. 8 to 10 | Surrey Arts Centre \nOct. 27 to 31 | ACT in Maple Ridge \nTickets and info: $25 (adults)/$18 (seniors), metrotheatre.com \nFor those who think they’ve been drained dry by vampire revamps, a new version of Bram Stoker’s famous creation offers two exciting twists. \nThe Royal Canadian Theatre Company’s upcoming Dracula revives the original 1927 Broadway smash that launched Bela Lugosi’s movie career and led to him being cast in Universal’s 1931 Dracula. \nBut this Dracula features a steampunk setting and a sexy foil, as the bloodthirsty ghoul’s arch-nemesis is no longer another alpha male with a stake to grind, but an attractive woman. \n“What we have done is explored things they wouldn’t have explored then by casting Van Helsing as a woman,” said Ellie King, director of Dracula and founder of the Royal Canadian Theatre Company. \nStoker’s Dracula was written in 1897, toward the end of the Victorian era, and was “a kickback against sexual repression,” she said. \n“It’s like, if you squeeze toothpaste in the tube too far, it’s going to spread out in another direction. And that’s basically what Dracula was. I wanted to explore this by casting Van Helsing as a woman to look at what would happen if this ultimate sexual predator, this animal, was to meet a female as strong, or almost as strong as himself.” \nThe Count is played here by Kurtis Maguire, the vampire hunter Van Helsing by Kathryn Stewart. Other cast members include Elyse Maloway, Hannah Williams, Adam Olgui, Paul Fisher, Aaron Paul Stewart and Jamie O’Neill. \nWhen trying to figure out ways to present the material in novel ways, King hit on the idea of setting the play in the retro-futurist Victorian style of the steampunk esthetic. \n“It seemed like a natural fit,” she said. \n“Steampunk itself has a dark, Gothic-y feel, and this play is written as a melodrama Gothic thriller. It’s a perfect combination.” \nTo give the play a steampunk look, King went to her sometimes collaborator, Andrea Hughes. \n“She came up with some sketches and ideas, and I thought they were wonderful,” the director said. \nHughes contributed some of her own ideas, including the suggestion that the costumes of some of the characters evolve during the play. \n“As they are drawn more into the world of the vampire, they become more steampunk,” King said. \nKing calls Hughes’ design for sexy Van Helsing “stunning.” Hughes also brings her touch to the lighting design. \n“She knows how to light,” King said. “She doesn’t over-light, she gives mood atmosphere, she totally illuminates the piece.” \nThis isn’t King’s first vampire rodeo. \n“When I first came to Canada 33 years ago, I didn’t know anybody,” said the British expat. \n“There was an ad in the local paper for a play, a local community theatre show. And it was Dracula, with the same script. I played the maid. So this is sort of like a flashback to 33 years ago, but it’s a very different treatment. We are playing it much more naturalistically than they would have done back then.” \nHer updated Dracula has some mature content. But, depending on their level of sophistication, King says, children “10 or 11, and upwards” might enjoy it. \n“Live theatre tends to be more immediate and scary than film. There are moments that might be disturbing for younger people. There’s no explicit sex or violence. It does get a bit shout-y at times. For teens and young adults, it’s not your usual theatre stuff.” \nThere’s one creepy moment in particular that she is excited about. \n“In the play, there is a stage direction for an appearance by Dracula, which is fairly mundane. I had this vision of how I wanted him to appear, stressing the fact that this is an animal out to feed, that this isn’t a Twilight, sexy teen heartthrob vampire. \n“There’s one moment that I wanted to create, and we’ve actually created that moment. I don’t want to give it away, it has a little bit of shock value to it. That would never have been in the original and has not been done, to my knowledge.” \nDespite the cobwebs that have gathered over the years in the house that Stoker built, King believes there’s still life in the undead. \n“Even though the script is older, and we’re kind of blasé about vampires and the whole vampire universe these days, I’m hoping that it still has the power to scare,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:42:55.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
