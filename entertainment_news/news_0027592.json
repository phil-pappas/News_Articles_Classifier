After enough funny roles, Carrey mixed it up with darker roles in \"Eternal Sunshine\" in 2004 and the heavily criticized \"The Number 23\" in 2007. After a series of less-than-loved films, Carrey managed to make it back to his Lloyd Christmas bowl cut in \"Dumb & Dumber To.\" Here's hoping there's some old-school Carrey still burning and on the way.\nBill Murray \"Broken Flowers\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama After earning his stripes from comedies like -- you guessed it -- \"Stripes,\" \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Caddy Shack\" in the 1980s, Murray's comedic roles started to peter out in the mid 1990s after \"Kingpin.\" Soon after, he would join one of the best Hollywood crews under the direction of Wes Anderson in \"Rushmore,\" but in 2003, Murray started getting serious with compelling roles in \"Lost in Translation\" -- he was nominated for an Oscar -- and 2005's \"Broken Flowers.\" In 2012, he played FDR, and in 2014, he played a strong lead in \"St. Vincent,\" but now he's back to comedic genius in a small role in the rebooted \"Ghostbusters\" and the upcoming fall film \"Rock the Kasbah,\" as well as the highly anticipated Netflix holiday release \"A Very Murray Christmas.\"\nSteve Carell \"Little Miss Sunshine\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama Though his appearance on \"The Office\" finale saved the show , it turns out when it comes to film, Carell is better in the dramatic roles, aside from his blubbering incoherent role as Brick in the \"Anchorman\" films. It started with \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" a family-centric indie in 2006, just after \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" and progressed with \"Dan in Real Life\" in 2007 and \"Crazy Stupid Love\" in 2011. Amongst those films were comedic duds like \"Evan Almighty,\" \"Get Smart\" and \"Dinner for Schmucks,\" giving us the clear impression that comedy is best left for Michael Scott, a \"you want to slap him so much, you love him\" kind of guy. The only time he was nominated for a big award outside of \"The Office\" was this year for \"Foxcatcher.\" Case closed.\nMelissa McCarthy \"St. Vincent\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama While she may have shit her bridesmaid dress on \"Bridesmaids,\" viewers were impressed by her genuine motherly role in 2014's \"St. Vincent,\" next door to Bill Murray. Although she comes off as a sisterly Chris Farley type and will likely fill the funny Venkman void in the upcoming \"Ghostbusters,\" McCarthy has managed to pave her own way with underrated comedies like \"Spy.\" McCarthy is talented and has a dangerously hot celebrity you didn't know she was related to.\nRobin Williams \"Good Will Hunting\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama The late comedian puts down the jokes and puts up his dukes in the 1997 Matt Damon drama, for which he won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Though he was a regular potty-mouthed funny man on stage, constantly doing impressions and occasionally bombing on TV, Williams single-handedly flipped from \"Jack\" and \"The Birdcage\" in 1996 to the role of his life in 1997, the same year he made \"Flubber.\" Williams was one of the most diverse actors of our time, but he got a bad rep right after \"Hook\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" those amazing movies in your VHS collection. We believe the word for that is \"Jumanji.\"\nAdam Sandler \"Punch Drunk Love\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama When people think of Sandler, it's the \"abba-dabba-gadoo\" of his early man-child roles, or they think of him as the Hollywood crew that sells out for high-paying crap comedies. But in actuality, amongst all his terrible movies made in the past 15 years, Sandler has delivered some decent dramatic roles. There's the 9/11 griever in \"Reign Over Me\" and the cancer-ridden, dark Apatow comedy \"Funny People,\" but nothing can top his impressive performance in \"Punch Drunk Love.\" It seems his only good movies are dramatic ones, but his most financially successful ones are the rotten movies getting rotten reviews . Luckily Netflix is throwing up some Hail Marys with less comedic roles like \"The Cobbler,\" so just sit back and wait for him to quit. Should be any day now [checks watch for next 30 years of bad movies].\nBen Stiller \"Greenberg\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama It seems like Stiller plays the same insecure, overprotective, anal lead in every comedy, from \"Along Came Polly\" to greats like \"Meet the Parents.\" But he impressed us with the dark -- very dark -- role in 2010: \"Greenberg,\" a story about a unabashed, untrusting pillhead trying to get his life on track. Outside of his \"Night at the Museum\" movies, Stiller has been fairly quiet since 2007's \"The Heartbreak Kid\" and 2008's \"Tropic Thunder.\" Stiller fans who miss his comedy will be happy to know \"Zoolander 2\" isn't so far away.\nKristin Wiig \"The Skeleton Twins\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama The \" Saturday Night Live\" great left her NBC slot to get more involved in film, but along the way she's managed to pick up some dramatic roles, aside from the \"Bridesmaids\"-type comedies. In 2014, she joined another comedic great, Bill Hader, in the dark brother-sister flick, \"The Skeleton Twins, followed by the dramatic romance, \"The Diary of a Teenage Girl\" in 2015. Now that people got their fill of Wiig's range for acting, they can enjoy her 2016 hilarity in \"Zoolander 2\" and \"Ghostbusters.\"\nMarlon Wayans \"Requiem for a Dream\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama No drama is more disturbing than the needle-poking, horrifyingly scored Jared Leto-lead \"Requiem for a Dream.\" If you can get through it once, you might've noticed funny man Marlon Wayans as Leto's unlikely sidekick. When you put it up against \"White Chicks\" and \"Scary Movie,\" it's a big jump for Wayans, who played the role with the grace of a true drug addict.\nJonah Hill \"Moneyball\"\n© Provided by Mandatory Entertainment, Movies, Comedic Actors Doing Drama When you saw Jonah Hill pouring booze into a gas can in 2007's \"Super Bad,\" you didn't think he was ever going to get himself an Oscar. How could he? He fell in line with all the other overweight, underappreciated actors who eventually got skinny . But when Brad Pitt's \"Moneyball\" was on the table, Hill made himself available for a more serious role, earning an Oscar nomination for best actor in a supporting role in 2012. On top of that, he continues to cleverly ride the coattails of other famous actors, including Leo in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and Channing Tatum in \"21 Jump Street,\" the former of which earned him another Oscar nom.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.mandatory.com/2012/05/08/10-former-fat-guys-who-look-totally-different-thin/", "http://www.mandatory.com/", "http://www.mandatory.com/2014/09/23/hollywoods-most-famous-crews-who-does-it-best/", "http://www.mandatory.com/2015/09/28/10-tv-series-finales-that-saved-the-show/", "http://www.mandatory.com/2015/09/15/10-upcoming-fall-films-that-should-be-on-your-radar/", "http://www.mandatory.com/2015/07/31/21-vhs-tapes-you-most-likely-had-in-your-childhood-collection/", "http://www.mandatory.com/2014/04/29/celebrities-you-probably-didnt-know-were-related/3", "http://www.mandatory.com/2015/04/16/the-12-most-famous-saturday-night-live-one-season-wonders/", "http://www.mandatory.com/2015/10/02/the-most-hilariously-rotten-reviews-for-the-worst-movies-on-rott/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:44:33.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
