My wife is from Baltimore, and she really likes the Orioles, so ...\"\nHey, at least it's not Cardinal.\nThe 28-seater will be open Tuesday to Saturday, and will offer a single tasting menu ranging from 15 to 20 courses. Customers will be offered two beverage pairings, one that will include cocktails, wine, beer and perhaps cider, and a somewhat more expensive, all-wine pairing.\nSandoval will be joined in the kitchen by two former sous chefs at Senza. \"We've got a good team already,\" he said.\nOriole's food will represent a natural extension of Sandoval's work at Senza, he says, with one important difference. Senza was strictly a gluten-free restaurant; Oriole will have abundant gluten-free options and other dietary accommodations, but will not be strictly gluten-free.\nSandoval is keeping mum on Oriole's exact location, except to say it'll be in the West Loop. \"It's a unique location,\" he said. \"In the middle of everything, while not in the middle.\"\nThe goal is to have Oriole open before the end of the year, but Sandoval is realistic about the delays that can occur.\n\"Whenever it opens,\" he said, \"it'll be really cold out.\"\nPhil Vettel is a Tribune critic\nPrivacy Policy GT Fish & Oyster Boka", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616eed6/turbine/ct-senza-chef-sandoval-to-open-oriole-in-west-loop-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:08:01.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
