I was extremely frustrated.” Christoph Waltz (Matt Crossick/PA Wire/Press Association Images) \nHe’s won two Academy Awards for roles in Quentin Tarantino movies, and said of the famed director: “He changed my life. He wrote the stuff that he offered me to win an Oscar with.” \nHe can currently be seen as the villain in the latest James Bond instalment, Spectre. \nHis Bond co-stars, Daniel Craig and Naomie Harris, and Bond theme singer Sam Smith were also guests on the show. \nDaniel, who has recently been quoted as saying he may not reprise the role, told Norton: “I’ll genuinely say that I have never done any job for the money. I can’t think about another one right at the moment because we have literally just finished this one. Now all I care about is getting the film in front of an audience. But, we’ll see.” Share article \nThe Graham Norton Show airs on BBC One on October 23 at 10.35pm Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:09:25.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
