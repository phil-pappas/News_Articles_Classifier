He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\"\nThe 50-year-old Rock -- a veteran of \"Saturday Night Live\" and star of several films -- confirmed his appearance with a tweet that said \"Look who's back.\"\nRock last hosted the Oscars in 2005, when \"Million Dollar Baby\" won best picture. He got mixed reviews, with some panning his performance and others praising his biting humor.\nMany at the time took offense to his jabs at several actors, including Jude Law and Colin Farrell.\nRock most recently wrote and starred in rom-com \"Top Five\" and directed Amy Schumer's stand-up comedy special on HBO.\nLast year's Oscars was hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, who struggled through the show. It was the lowest-rated Oscars telecast in six years.\nArts & Entertainment Celebrities Chris Rock", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:50:03.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
