It's an awkward situation, but Adalind is determined to be a better mother this time around (not hard, since her first baby keeps getting kidnapped). Let's just say she'll go to surprising lengths to live a relatively normal life with her baby daddy and half-Grimm, half-Hexenbiest child. Catch up on all this week's Mega Buzz But what do you call such a hybrid? A Hexengrimm? A Grimmerbiest? No matter what wacky Wesen name Monroe can dream up, at least the baby will go by a much more common name, one that is full of meaning for Nick. What are your best guesses for Baby Burkhardt's name? Grimm returns on Friday, Oct. 30 at 9/8c on NBC. Crave scoop on your favorite TV shows?
