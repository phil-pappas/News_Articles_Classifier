When the State Library of Victoria forecourt was last year made over into native grassland, passers-by routinely stopped to inquire what was going on. They shared photos of it online.\nIn a measure of how much \"landscape\" has started to figure in our thinking, this year's Australian Institute of Landscape Architecture (AILA) conference – traditionally an insular landscape-architects-talking-to-landscape-architects affair – has become a full-blown, multi-disciplinary festival.\nSound artists, designers, horticulturalists, environmentalists, philosophers, engineers, early childhood academics, you name it, will approach our connections with what AILA​ terms the \"urban ecosystem\" from an assortment of vantage points. \nContemporary intervention: Jeppe Aaraard Andersen for Chippendale. Photo: Simon Wood \nEverything from private gardens to city infrastructure to the \"rights\" of animals and plants will be up for examination. While plants won't feature in all of the festival projects – the temporary \"Krump Park\" at one end of Sandridge Bridge, for example, will likely be vegetation-free as will the installation by sonic-spatial-social artist Luke Jaaniste at MPavilion – there will be more of a horticultural element than we have come to expect in discussion about the landscaping of our cities. \nAdvertisement A pop-up green space in the Bourke Street Mall will illustrate some of the environmental, aesthetic and health benefits of gardens. People are invited to take tours of both historic parks and \"contemporary interventions\", while philosopher Damon Young (who wrote /Philosophy in the Garden/) will speak about the different relationships particular writers have had with their plants and gardens.\nLandscape architects, artists and others will also participate in a \"research summit\" and give lectures that will variously bring in our ecological responsibilities and how the design of open spaces is influenced by background noise, sunlight (or its absence), wind, building height, usage and – increasingly – climate change.\nThe Margaret Court Arena development by Aspect Studios, in the Melbourne Park Western Precinct \nLandscape architect Claire Martin, one of three creative directors for the event says our approach to our surrounding environment is much altered since the 19th century when most of Melbourne's \"beautiful but precious\" public gardens were established.  She says there was devaluing of parks in the 1900s (\"The only park we got in the 20th century was Birrarung Marr\"), but that – partly in response to climate change – we are now seeing a 21st century \"hybridisation of green infrastructure\".\nShe says projects like the High Line – the intensely-planted and wildly popular park established on disused railway tracks in New York – has re-awakened people's interest in plants, planting diversity and re-using existing spaces. \"Horticulture and plants are making a massive come back within landscape architecture.\" \nThe increasing prevalence of green walls and roofs (the festival's opening party is being held in the sculpture garden on the roof of the NGV International car park) is, Martin says, an indication of how landscape architecture and architecture are starting to merge. \nBox Hill Gardens, Melbourne, Victoria \n\"We are seeing cities as a built environment, not just buildings with landscapes in between. There is a mutualistic relationship between people and their environments and we are trying to get people to reconnect with the city and each other.\"\nAt the festival, Sydney landscape architect Sue Barnsley will look at what we \"love and long for\" in our landscapes, while Australian-born US-based artist and engineer Natalie Jeremijenko (who once transformed the area around Manhattan fire hydrants into miniature parks with flowers, grasses and mosses) will discuss the \"rights\" of nature and how you can raise awareness about the environment through unlikely ways, such as her Environmental Health Clinic, which operates like doctors' rooms which you visit with environmental maladies. \nSpanish landscape architect Marti​ Franch​ Batllori​ has much to say about the beauty of landscape as both an intimate one-to-one experience and as something that is across-the-board fundamental to the construction of cities, while early childhood education specialist Dr Barbara Chancellor and others will discuss the future of play in the city – for children, teenagers and adults.\nJust as the City of Melbourne is currently calling on people to \"join the conversation\" on new plans for City Road, University Square and the Domain Parklands (almost 123 hectares of space that includes the Royal Botanic Gardens, Alexandra Gardens and the Kings Domain, among other gardens), Martin says the AILA​ festival is a way of engaging people with the landscapes of our cities.\nThis Public Life, Festival of Landscape Architecture runs from October 10-20.
