Now, in an interview with The Guardian , he has labelled him a 'talentless little pr*ck'.\n\"Some of these young kids have grown up in a world that doesn’t understand or respect copyright material or intellectual property. They look at songs as interactive playthings,\" he said. \"I didn’t think he was cool. I thought he was a talentless little prick. And I still do.\"\nOcean wasn't the only star to fall foul of Henley ; when asked his thoughts on Kanye West , he said: \"I don’t like him, either. He won’t be president. He’s either incredibly arrogant or incredibly insecure, or some combination of the two.\"\nSo there'll be no future Paul McCartney -style collaborations for Henley, in other words.\nMORE: Watch: Miley describes herself as an 'international phenomenon' on Fallon.
