Later on, the actress recreated the moment, painting \"Anushka hearts Dude\" on a lock, and throwing the key into La Seine on the 'love-lock' bridge in Paris.\nFor all those who are wondering who Dude is, let us clarify that it's not the cricketer who is currently the captain of the Indian Test side and the IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore.\nVirat Kohli comes a close second to her \"ideal movie partner\", who happens to be her pet Labrador, Dude.\nNow, Mirror has learnt that the 27-year-old actress is taking her commitment to Dude one step further. This Diwali, Anushka launches 'Pawsitivity,' a campaign aimed at sensitising people about the adverse effects of noise, air, water and soil pollution on animals.\n\"The focus of the initiative is to generate interest amongst the youth and children through innovation and technology. Animals make the world a better place and it is our responsibility to be sensitive towards them as they don't have a voice,\" she explains. \"When someone bursts a firecracker, they don't realise how badly it affects animals and birds. I want people to care and avoid making noise.\"\nAnushka also points out it's a proven fact that in most Indian cities, noise pollution levels go up to 80-100 per cent around Diwali, as bursting crackers is an accepted ritual everywhere. \"But the noise created by these crackers scares animals, destroys their everyday life patterns and causes death in some cases,\" she adds.\nSo ahead of Diwali, the actress will launch an extensive social media campaign which several Bollywood stars are expected to join. The larger goal is to bring down the decibel levels in residential areas and reduce noise pollution in general.\n\"Diwali is a festival of lights and happiness. It can be celebrated in a safe, healthy manner. Spare a thought for our voiceless friends,\" she pleads.\nThe actress, who turned producer earlier this year with NH10, had lashed out against the Yulin Dog Meat Festival of China in June. She also started a campaign on Twitter to put an end to the festival, that centres around the slaughtering of thousands of dogs every year in Southern China. The campaign was supported by Alia Bhatt, Sonakshi Sinha and Jacqueline Fernandez.\n\"Animals don't have a voice, you do. Help end this cruelty,\" she had reiterated, pointing out that celebrity figures should be prominent advocates of animal welfare and constantly campaign for animal rights.\nIn the West, Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey had flown to Louisiana in 2005 to support the rescue of 70 deserted pets through his initiative 'Growing Up With Pets,' which teaches parents the importance of a pet in a child's life.\nSimilarly, Leonardo DiCaprio has campaigned to protect wild elephants with the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Africa while Anne Hathaway has proposed \"All-vegan celebrity weddings\" and \"Custom vegan heels,\" which supports the cruelty-free movement by making sure no animal products are seen on celebrities, even on screen.\nAnushka herself turned vegetarian in 2014 and now is out to ensure that every Dude has his day, even on Diwali!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:29:25.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
