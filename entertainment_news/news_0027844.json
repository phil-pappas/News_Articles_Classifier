Jones Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015, 10:40 AM \nAmber Rose and Blac Chyna have reportedly pulled the plug on their new MTV reality show. \nBest friends Rose, 31, and Blac Chyna, 27, were nailing down the final contracts for the upcoming show in late August. However, the website is now reporting the show has been cancelled, though the reason why is unclear. \nBlac Chyna and Rose have apparently told friends that they’re each too busy with other business obligations. Rose is working on developing her own talk show and Blac Chyna working on her own product deals, TMZ said. \nThe publication alleges, though, that the real reason the show won’t be happening is because Blac Chyna and Rose are no longer friends. The reason for the end to the publicity-filled friendship? Blac Chyna didn’t attend Rose’s L.A. slut walk last weekend and instead opted to party with rapper Future in Atlanta.

Kim Kardashian apparently called Rose after her slut wak and expressed a desire to keep things amicable. \"'Without being able to trash the Kardashians, they just felt like their show does not have much weight anymore,'\" said an anoymous Radar source.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:07:23.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
