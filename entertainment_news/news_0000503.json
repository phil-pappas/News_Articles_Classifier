Participating Dayton area bakery-cafes will give 100 percent of the proceeds from all pink ribbon bagel sales to two area charities — the Pink Ribbon Girls and the Miami Valley Hospital Foundation. \nThe bagels sell for $1.29 each. Throughout the rest of October, 13 cents from each pink ribbon bagel will be donated. \nIn addition, you’ll find donation canisters at the Panera Bread registers. Panera is encouraging customers to take a photo with their bagels, shaped in the form of the iconic pink ribbon They feature cherry chips, dried cherries and cranberries, vanilla, honey and brown sugar and are baked fresh each morning.
