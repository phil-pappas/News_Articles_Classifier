(LOS ANGELES) -- Khloe Kardashian and some of her family -- Kim, Kendall, Kylie and Kourtney -- have taken to their websites to announce an apparent online time out in support of Khloe's estranged husband, Lamar Odom, as he fights for his life in a Nevada hospital. \n\"As a family we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar,\" reads the statement, posted Thursday night. \"Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time.\" \nOdom, 35, was found unconscious at The Love Ranch, a legal brothel in Crystal, Nevada, Tuesday and has since been hospitalized in Las Vegas for further treatment. \nIn addition to the recent message on the websites, many members of the Kardashian family have taken to social media to ask for prayers for the two-time NBA champion. \n\"Please pray for Lamar #ourfighter,\" Khloe's mom Kris Jenner wrote on Instagram Wednesday night, along with a picture from the former NBA star's glory days with the L.A. Lakers. \nOdom's close friend and brother-in-law Rob Kardashian also took to Instagram to say, \"Praying nonstop for my Brother !!\" while Kourtney posted a sweet throwback of Lamar and her son, Mason. \"Believing in the power of prayer for this beautiful soul,\" the caption reads. \nOdom and Kardashian were married in 2009, but divorce papers were filed in late 2013, which were singed by both parties earlier this year. The divorce is not believed to have been finalized. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
