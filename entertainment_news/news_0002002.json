I would be more than grateful to come to Australia to raise awareness about domestic violence.Im not the pink elephant in the room anymore \n— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) September 29, 2015 \nHe had previously been rebuffed in his efforts to enter the UK in 2010, after pleading guilty to what the Home Office said was a serious criminal offence. \nBut the Yeah 3x singer is not the first celebrity to face embarrassment at the borders, with dozens of famous faces having fallen foul of immigration control. \nHere are six others. 1. Selena Gomez Russian rejection: Gomez was turned away reportedly because of her pro-gay stance (Matt Sayles/Invision) \nA far cry from rejection on the grounds of a dark criminal history, Selena Gomez was refused a Russian visa in 2013 reportedly because she supported gay rights. \nThe actress and singer was forced to cancel several gigs because authorities allegedly felt she broke a law forbidding the perceived promotion of “nontraditional”– or gay – relationships to children. Promoted stories The Beatles: Making visa complications cool since 1964 (AP) \nIn the sixties, Beatlemania had shaken up youth culture on every corner of the globe. \nFew countries, however, tried to quell the rising rock n roll phenomenon with legislative intervention. \nIsrael did just that, resolving in 1964 that the Beatles were to be banned from playing in their country because of the “negative influence” they would almost certainly have on young Israelis. 3. Akon Always watch where you stage your parties (Todd Williamson/Invision) \nFor R&B star Akon, it was a poor choice of filming location for his music video which complicated his travel plans. \nThe 2010 video for Sexy Chick with David Guetta featured an army of women in bikinis partying in front of a giant statue of Buddha. \nSri Lanka, a Buddhist country, perhaps unsurprisingly took issue with a sacrosanct religious site being turned into a place where Akon could watch “bootie movin” and promptly banned him. 4. Snoop Dogg In the Dogghouse: Snoop is the master of travel bans (Matt Crossick/PA) \nBy all accounts, it would probably be quicker to list the countries in which Snoop Dogg hasn’t annoyed the authorities. \nIn 2006, the rapper was banished from Blighty following a brawl at Heathrow – which he was eventually cleared of – which saw a duty-free shop vandalised. \nHis criminal convictions stopped him entering Australia the next year and in 2012 his possession of marijuana ensured he was not afforded clemency by Norwegian immigration authorities. \nAdd to that an arrest in Sweden this year and you have a pretty formidable list of countries Snoop has ticked off. 5. Tyler, the Creator Tyler, The Creator’s potty mouth was enough to cross the Home Office (Jack Plunkett/Invision) \nControversial rapper Tyler, the Creator was turned away at the UK border last month on the orders of the Home Office after it was deemed his music encouraged “violence and intolerance”. \nThe songs in question, from 2009 and 2011, were famed for their shock value, including Yonkers, which described a violent attack on singer Bruno Mars. BASED ON LYRICS FROM 2009 I AM NOT ALLOWED IN THE UK FOR 3-5 YEARS ( although i was there 8 weeks ago) THAT IS WHY THE SHOWS WERE CANCELLED. \n— Tyler, The Creator (@fucktyler) August 26, 2015 \nBut Tyler has long insisted his lyrics were written from the perspective of an alter-ego and claims he hasn’t written similar songs since. \nDespite the ban, it gives us small joy to think at one stage the furious sounds of Tyler, the Creator could have been ringing around the halls of the Home Office. 6. Brad Pitt Even Brad Pitt has had his share of overseas struggles ( David Davies/PA) \nFor more than 10 years, the world’s biggest film star was banned from the world’s biggest country. \nBrad Pitt incurred the wrath of the Chinese state in 1997 with his appearance in the film Seven Years In Tibet, which the authorities felt portrayed Chinese military officers in an overly negative light. Share article \nHe and the film’s director found themselves banned from entering the country until the Shanghai International Film Festival in 2012, when all was apparently forgiven and forgotten.
