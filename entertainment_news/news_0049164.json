Picture: JARRAD SANG. Source: Supplied \nTHAT not all audiences are the same is not surprising. But just how audiences differ may be. \nJosh Cunningham of long-running Australian band The Waifs has noticed a difference in how US audiences respond to the group’s music compared to their Australian compatriots. \nThe US delivers a “more of a sedate listening crowd,” he suggests. \nAustralians are enthusiastic and energetic, Cunningham says, pointing out that The Waifs enjoy both audience’s responses. \n“Maybe it’s just a function of the kind of venues that we play over there,” he says by way of a caveat. \nHe recounts a Waifs’ gig in the US state of Colorado that was visited by some Australian relatives. \n“They were blown away, because they said: ‘There’s 5000 people all sitting down, watching you guys play and they’re quiet’.” \nWhether Cairns audiences reflect Cunningham’s broad experience of Australian audiences will be tested when The Waifs perform their sold out show at Flecker Gardens later in October. \nJust who The Waifs are is not something as easy to answer as one might expect. That the band comprises Cunningham and sisters Vikki Thorn and Donna Simpson is certain. \nBut playing with them at the Cairns show will be Ben Franz and Dave Ross Macdonald. \nThey have been with The Waifs for years: Dave for 17 and Ben for 15, Cunningham says. \n“There may be a time when we might want to do just acoustic trio kind of stuff like we did in the past, and we’d always reserve the right I guess to do that,” he says. \n“Outwardly, publicly, the identity of the band’s always been Donna, Vikki and myself, but I guess, the guys have been playing with us for so long that they’re really part of the identity of the band too.” \nTo see Cunningham’s point regarding the outward image of the band, one need only look at The Waifs’ Facebook profile picture (it is minus Franz and Macdonald). \nThe band have previously ventured to Far North Queensland before. \nIn 2011, they visited the Tanks Art Centre. That same year they released their album Temptation . \nUntil earlier this year, that record remained the group’s most recent full-length release. \nIt was in August that the group released their latest offering, the ARIA-nominated Beautiful You which charged on to the ARIA Albums Chart. \nTwenty-three years into their careers, at least one thing has not changed. \nThe three songwriters have always written individually and though an attempt was made to write collaboratively for the album, old habits die hard. \nDespite their separate writing (Cunningham acknowledges subtle stylistic differences among the songwriters), there is also a commonality. \n“We all write from the heart, write from experience”. \n“(We’ve) never been, kind of, pretentious or trying to make up stories or push an agenda. \n“It’s just more stuff that’s happening in our lives and stuff that means something to us and try to put it as simply and in a way that, I guess, probably resonates with a lot of people.” \nCHECK The Waifs perform at the sold out Music Botanica at Flecker Gardens on October 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:01:51.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
