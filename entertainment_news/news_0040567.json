The remaining stars will be doing everything to make sure it's not them, so we should be in for some pretty spectacular moves this evening.As we saw last week with Jay's quickstep, anything could happen, so join us from 6.35pm when the show kicks off on BBC One and we'll bring you all the action... © BBC Pictures / Guy Levy20:20That's your lot for tonight though? Do keep hitting the comments to let us know what you made of tonight's action. Who was the best? Who was the worst? And who do you think will be going home? And stick with DS for all the Strictly coverage you need!20:17Right, so Kellie and Helen are at the top of the leaderboard... while Jeremy is down at the bottom. But will that stay the same after you've cast your votes? The voting is now open!20:14It's an 8 from Craig, a 9 from Darcey, a 9 from Len and a 9 from Bruno for a total of 35! Not too shabby at all, Kellie.It's no #Strictly secret that @kelliebright76 and @keviclifton are top dancers! pic.twitter.com/8eDBEe4TfY— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201520:13Darcey calls Kellie's jive \"extraordinary\", while Len says he'd like the clocks to go back right now so he can watch it again! \"That was ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK AND VICTORY!\" Bruno yells. And then Craig goes in with some criticism: \"But it was clean and sharp,\" he adds. We think they liked it, you guys. What did you reckon?20:12We can definitely get on board with Kellie being a secret agent in a hat. And the jive ain't half bad either! There's so much going on in it - our heads are spinning and we're going to need a nap afterwards but it's seriously impressive. Kellie is thrilled too - she jumps up and down when the dance is done!20:10Righto - time for our final couple of the night. I know, already! It's Kellie Bright & Kevin Clifton, who will be taking on the jive. If it's anything like her Charleston, we should be in for a treat... © BBC / Ray Burmiston 20:08After Tess apologises for Bruno saying - oh, let's be honest, \"bollocks\" - he says he didn't even realise. Goodness. Let's move quickly on to the scores: 8 from Craig, 9 from Darcey, 8 from Len and 8 from Bruno for a total of 33. He's heading back up again! What did you think of that?Rocking the #Strictly studio, it's @jaymcguiness and @AlionaVilani! pic.twitter.com/tDF8IfoRzl— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201520:07\"You're the opposite of Sampson - you've had your hair cut, and you've gone from strength to strength,\" he announces. Bruno has the audience in hysterics after saying something rather naughty indeed - Darcey can barely even look at him and now has her head in her hands. It's all kind of gone to pot to be honest.20:06Craig thinks the dance could have had more \"menace\". We can only assume this is just because he's essentially the male version of Cruella de Vil, because we were SCARED. He does praise Jay on his technique though, while Darcey says they were the best arms she's seen on a male celebrity ever. But she too agrees Jay needs to have \"attitude\" and should care about Aliona less.20:04Goodness! We're feeling a bit scared of Jay, who is going at this paso doble full throttle. If the judges want attack, by golly they've got it. He's nailed the character, but the technique looks pretty good too. It's not quite his jive, but we think Jay's back on track.20:02Next up: Jay McGuiness & Aliona Vilani. Will he be able to recover from his quickstep nightmare? He's said he felt like he was in a blind panic - so can he avoid that this time around with his paso doble? He brings his Wanted mate Nathan Sykes along for training. Or, er, ping pong. Whatever. © BBC / Ray Burmiston 20:00Helen says she was \"really nervous\" before she danced - and thought she might forget the steps! No worries, in the end. And here are the scores: 9 from Craig, 9 from Darcey, 8 from Len and 9 from Bruno for a total of 35! Those are Helen's first 9s... and it's the highest score of the night so far.19:59If the judges were complaining about Jeremy's smile, what will they say about Helen's grin? She looks like slightly terrified. But that's by the by because she gets a standing ovation from the audience, and Craig says: \"One word: fab-u-lous.\" Bruno thinks they're heading for the top, while Darcey praises the \"beautiful details\" in the dance. Len's actually the one who has a couple of criticisms - but says the train-themed dance was \"right on track\". Nice work, Helen!19:57This quickstep basically begins with Helen running away from Aljaz, as if any woman would ever run away from Aljaz. I mean, that's just not believable. Of course, Helen is consistently good and she's pulling it out of the bag again tonight with a crisp and clean dance.19:55Helen George & Aljaz Skorjanec are next up - and yes, Aljaz has denied those rumours that Helen is bitchy. Now that's out of the way, how will their quickstep go? \"This is really fast,\" Helen says in training. Clue's kind of in the name to be honest. © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:54Here are the scores: 3 from Craig (ouch), 5 from Darcey, 6 from Len and 4 from Bruno for a total of 18. \"Fair enough,\" Jeremy says graciously - but Claudia cheers him up by telling him he's number four on Grazia's lust list. Crikey.We couldn't take our eyes off of @thejeremyvine and @karen_hauer! #Strictly pic.twitter.com/NKhEAyWSrH— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201519:53\"I found it a bit lifeless this week - maybe because next week is Halloween and you're trying to get into a zombie character.\" Bruno just can't be kind this week, can he? Craig drawls that it was shapeless and plodding: \"It looked like you were dragging a log.\" Karen grins that she'll take one for the team. And Darcey's there to say that she found Jeremy's smile \"incredibly charming\" - but tells him not to tense up when he's nervous.19:51Len says he smiles throughout Jeremy's dances: \"I love the effort that you've put into it.\" And he praises Jeremy for maintaining his height despite being such a tall man. \"It needed a bit more flair but I always enjoy watching you,\" he concludes. Bruno has the giggles, mind. \"It was a waltz by the book - a book that went out of publishing about 50 years ago because they burned it.\" Ouch.19:50I mean, Jeremy looks a bit like a dad at a wedding but that's no bad thing, right? He basically drags Karen across the floor at one point, and there aren't so many places to hide in a waltz (as compared to his exuberant party dances). But he's really trying hard and looks like he's having the best time. It is nice to see another side of him too, right?19:48ELVIS COSTELLO! Just hanging out with a video message to Jeremy, who'll be dancing to 'She'. \"I've been to see him in concert 23 times,\" Jeremy giggles like a fanboy. It's kind of adorable - will his desire to do 'She' justice help him out?19:48YES. Next up are Jeremy Vine & Karen Clifton! He's desperate to stay in, so presumably he won't be wearing a shower cap this week. © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:47Miranda Hart is both a) backing Carol and b) making us hungry.Behind on @bbcstrictly coz had the urge to cook sausages but @carolkirkwood my fav contestant ever. Doing it for us non dancers with a smile— Miranda Hart (@mermhart) October 24, 201519:46Claudia says the judges were \"extra harsh\", but let's see if the scores will be. It's 4 from Craig, 6 from Darcey, 6 from Len and 5 from Bruno for a total of 21 - 12 less than last week. Oh dear!What a simmering #Strictly Salsa from @thekatiederham & @theantondubeke to banish the cold autumn evening! pic.twitter.com/SkVL50gPeY— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201519:44Bruno praises Katie for going for it (\"I thought you were a nice girl!\") but says she lost the timing and needs to work on grounding her Latin. He obviously does some thrusting to demonstrate. Len looks genuinely disgusted. And here's Craig, who complains about the hip action - poor Katie looks gutted. \"That sadly, was just a shimmy and a dreadful, dreadful salsa.\" No need to be quite that brutal, Craig.19:43Darcey says there was lots of fun and speed - but says it wasn't the right \"spice or hotness\", and calls it \"messy in places\". She adds: \"Latin, sadly, isn't your strength.\" Asked if Len loves her in Latin as much as in ballroom, he replies, baffled: \"I love her wherever she is, I suppose.\" But he says Katie wasn't shaking her assets enough and thinks she's the opposite of Jamelia, who's uncomfortable in ballroom.19:41A trip to the salsa club - it's a Strictly tradition for Katie and Anton! But how will their salsa compare? We're not sure about Katie's upper body wiggling, we'll be honest, and she seems a little uncertain coming out of a lift. In fact, we spot a couple of stumbles, sadly. But aside from that, she's properly got into her character, and the final spinning lift is pretty spectacular (though the final position is a little awkward). Definitely a mixed bag, that one.19:39Next up? Katie Derham & Anton Du Beke... who topped the leaderboard last week! Of course, Craig still thinks Anton is wasting an opportunity with Katie - can Anton prove him wrong this week? © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:37There we go: Jamelia can't help but have a little cry. \"I can't stop crying!\" she laughs. \"I think it might be me,\" Claudia worries. But let's see if Jamelia's sobbing after the scores: 5 from Craig, 7 from Darcey, 7 from Len and 7 from Bruno for a total of 26. That could be worse, Jamelia!A carriage AND a proposal?! That #Strictly Foxtrot from @jamelia & @tristanmacmanus had it all! pic.twitter.com/Qa79T52Ufm— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201519:36Len says Jamelia has a mental block about ballroom and gets \"uptight\" - but he says she had \"a style\" and adds it wasn't all bad. And Bruno says the first half was \"like a nice cup of Horlicks\" - very pleasant and warm - but agrees that she lost it after making a mistake. Tristan reminds Jamelia to think about the positives as they head up (\"Stuff like that happens!\")19:35Craig says the end of the dance ruined it because of an \"illegal lift\" - he says it went \"horribly wrong\". He also complains about Jamelia's feet being far apart: \"You looked like you'd just jumped off a horse.\" But Darcey praises her top line... though she says Jamelia lost it when she came out of hold. Jamelia looks like she might have a little cry.19:33Well, we're not sure this is as good as Jamelia's Charleston last week, sadly. It just seems like she's thinking about it a bit more - maybe a bit less sure of herself. As the dance continues, it does get a little better, but Jamelia just doesn't look as comfortable. What did you think?19:32Forget mums - Jamelia's brought her kids along to help out in training (and act as the judges!) \"Keep practising,\" one of them tells Jamelia, tactfully.19:31Shall we have another couple? It's time for Jamelia & Tristan MacManus, who'll be taking the foxtrot on. They're going to have a carriage on the dancefloor, but not a horse - cue Claudia trying to pretend she's holding on to a horse off screen. We admire her commitment... that's about the best thing we can say. © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:29Here are the scores, though: 4 from Craig, 6 from Darcey, 6 from Len and 5 from Bruno for a total of 21. What did you think about Ainsley's dance? Was that scoring fair?19:28\"It was a mix of the 'Shake, Rattle & Roll' and the Shake N Vac,\" Len announces, firmly pitching this show at people who remember the existence of Shake N Vac. On the other hand, the audience giggles when he says Ainsley needs to get on his balls more. We love you, audience.#AinsleyHarriott & @RealNatalieLowe threw everything into that #Strictly Jive (even the kitchen sink!). pic.twitter.com/7xsp9J5Ytj— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201519:27Craig agrees it needs to be more technical now (\"too much of your own thing going on\") and says he didn't enjoy it. Oh dear. But Darcey says Ainsley's there to entertain everyone. \"The character sometimes overtakes occasionally,\" she adds. Can you imagine Ainsley dialling that down though? I mean, would it even be possible?19:26\"There was so much shaking that it made it almost curdle,\" Bruno gasps, saying it was a \"very individual\" version of a jive. He does say the timing has improved, but says the kicks and flicks need to be different. \"You go into your own impersonation of a dance,\" he says. That's what we like, Bruno!19:24Ainsley's limbs are all over the place. We don't think this is a good jive, but honestly, we're so distracted by Ainsley's energy and AMAZING facial expressions. And to be fair, he's remembered the whole routine...19:23To help Ainsley's stamina, timing and co-ordination (and so that the producers have a fun VT), Natalie brings in a light reaction machine. This ain't The Cube! Will it work, though?19:22HOORAY. It's time for Ainsley Harriott & Natalie Lowe! They're giving the jive a go this week and we basically cannot wait. © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:21Even Louie Spence is a fan...@therealkirstyg did a great job this evening elegance and class well done x— Louie Spence (@louiespence) October 24, 201519:21Claudia says the \"J word\": Kirsty is having a \"journey\"! And here are the scores: 7 from Craig, 7 from Darcey, 8 from Len and 7 from Bruno for a total of 29! Quite a turnaround, right?We're dizzy after that #Strictly Waltz from @therealkirstyg and @brendancole! pic.twitter.com/8rtUcqTvca— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201519:19\"Your stock is on the rise and your assets are definitely worth investing in,\" Bruno announces, saying that the change in one week is unbelievable (he says she was at one with the music and Brendan). \"You were actually dancing tonight so that's one good thing,\" Craig begins. But of course here he goes about the problems (he does finish by saying she was \"shining\"). And Darcey says the dance was a \"wonderful surprise\".19:18Kirsty doesn't look particularly happy when the dance finishes - she's feeling dizzy, apparently! Len can't quite make his mind up: \"You took longer to get down them stairs than I would with one knee and a crutch.\" But he says Kirsty pulled it off big time when she did: \"I thought she was going to be wooden!\" He even says it was Kirsty's best dance.19:17We do love a dance that starts at the top of the stairs, but my, Kirsty takes a long time to get them. When she does, it still just seems a little stiff to us - although we obviously like it when the spins get going. Kirsty has some stamina, that's for sure - we're getting a bit dizzy watching.19:15\"The Viennese waltz is a very soft, romantic dance. Kirsty is not a soft dancer.\" Alright, Brendan - say what you really mean.19:14Kirsty Gallacher & Brendan Cole are taking to the dance floor next - will they be able to recover after being in the bottom two last week? © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:13\"Have you seen, I'm Blue Peter today,\" Peter announces. Erm. Let's move quickly on to the scores: 7 from Craig, 7 from Darcey, 8 from Len and 7 from Bruno for a total of 29. What do you think about that?Did @mrpeterandre and @Jmanrara's Rumba get your heart pumping? #Strictly pic.twitter.com/MuZ0c8XUIG— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 201519:12Bruno says Peter is \"immersed\" in the character and dance, but agrees that he can be too staccato sometimes: \"You have to caress it.\" Oo-er! Craig also has his criticisms (about the hips and his stompiness) but adds that Peter placed Janette really well. What did you think of Peter's dance? Was it good for a male celeb doing the rumba?19:10Darcey says Peter has loads of \"emotion\" and \"tender love and care\" for Janette - but warns that he has to be \"juicy\" with his ends. She's being fussy because she knows he can do well! Len is grinning though - he says the rumba can be really tough for male celebs but Peter pitched it \"pretty damn good\".19:09Well, Peter's dancing to 'Thinking Out Loud', which will probably win him votes almost immediately (we are putting a bet on someone dancing to Adele's 'Hello' next week). The audience basically gasps at one of his sexy hip swivels, too - parts of the routine are ever so slightly stiff, but overall this is a very nice routine - especially the bit where Peter makes Janette's heart pop. Nice.19:07Ooh, this is interesting - next up are Peter Andre & Janette Manrara. This has to be the earliest they've ever performed, right? They're doing a rumba this week - given that Peter had no idea what a rumba was earlier this week, will he be able to pull it off? © BBC / Ray Burmiston 19:05Here are the scores! Anita's very happy with her 8 from Craig - it's followed by 8 from the other judges, too, for a total of 32. \"Oh my God, wow!\" Anita gasps, vowing not to cry because Klingons don't. We're now accepting that we've just completely missed this Star Trek thing.19:04\"I'm with it,\" Len huffs when Tess says he likes a traditional tango. \"I know on Countryfile you put on your wellies, but tonight you came out and gave it some welly,\" he adds, in one of his most tenuous puns yet, before saying she looked like a \"panther\" and praising it. Bruno takes the Star Trek comment and runs with it, bizarrely, before saying he loved Anita's \"arrogance\". By the end, no-one quite knows if he's finished or not, because no-one quite knew what he was saying.19:02Hooray! Craig says he loved the choreography in the routine - he does note one moment when Anita lost balance but says overall he loved it. Darcey loved the Star Trek feel to the dance (nope, us neither). But she says Anita has the others fighting a place in the competition!19:01We really are not on board with this choice of music at all - it just does not work for a tango. But will people be able to look past that at the dance? We hope so, because Anita is showing off some real skill and that was a good dance in our eyes.19:00Georgia's not the only one who's got her mum involved this week - Anita's ma is down from Yorkshire! Will that little boost help her out? We think it's a bit bizarre that they're doing a tango to 'Sweet Disposition' but there's certainly a lot of attack going on - and Anita spins round in between Gleb's legs. Behave now.18:59Time next for Anita Rani & Gleb Savchenko! They've been opening up about their \"intense\" relationship this week - will that fieriness help their tango? © BBC / Ray Burmiston 18:57Here are the scores. Gulp. It's a 4 from Craig, a 6 from Darcey, a 6 from Len and a 5 from Bruno for a total of 21. \"Craig's 4 is faintly ridiculous,\" Claudia complains.18:56Len points out that Carol has had no dance experience ever - and points out there was elegance, style and content. \"You came out and you gave me what I expected - a very nice, stylish Viennese waltz.\" What did you think?18:55I mean, Craig does actually agree with Bruno but says Carol is trying hard: \"I can see some light, darling, at the end of the tunnel.\" Darcey says Pasha gave her a lot to think about and she didn't make any mistakes - but she gives her some advice about feeling like her arms are breathing. Bruno is gesturing wildly at the end of the desk. Obviously.18:54Bruno says he could see there was a lot of content in the dance but complains about Carol's free hand: \"It looked like you were clearing the desks.\" He tells her to \"feel\" it more: \"It's all kind of bland-ish.\" Bit harsh, no? Even Len looks horrified, while the audience boo. And here's a turn-up for the books: \"That was nasty, Bruno,\" Craig complains.18:53Oh, you know, we know Carol isn't the best dancer and maybe it's because the Viennese waltz is an inherently lovely dance, but she looks pretty graceful. Sure, the footwork isn't perfect and it's not going to be as good as Katie's dance last week, but this is a huge improvement for Carol - nice work.18:51To conquer her dizziness, Pasha is taking Carol to a theme park. SURE WHY NOT. Carol is spending the entire time laughing though which is very nice.18:50Time for another one! Next up are Carol Kirkwood & Pasha Kovalev, who are taking on the Viennese waltz. She has admitted she's spent most of this week feeling dizzy so will she get through it? © BBC / Ray Burmiston 18:49\"Now the party really begins because it's time for the terms and conditions.\" What is the best way to get Claudia Winkleman to marry us?18:48Eww, Giovanni's shoulder kept dislocating during training? No. NO. This is not something we want to hear. Eww. Here are the scores though: 7 from Craig, 8 from Darcey, 8 from Len and 8 from Bruno - a total of 31!18:47Here's Craig complaining about \"poor\" movement into and out of the lifts and says her legs were \"uncontrolled\". He gets mightily boos from the audience, mind! Darcey says she wanted to join in with the dance - can we please see that? Anyway, she says the judges are only being fussy because they know Georgia can go far.18:46Len calls the routine \"terrific\" and says it was \"full of vim and vigour\". And he praises her for \"working her assets down below\". Goodness me! (He does also notice one slip - but says no-one else will have seen it.) And here's Bruno calling Georgia a \"gorgeous little crumpet\": \"It's good to see you so alive.\" He advises her to be a bit more careful with her dismounts but says he loved it.18:44Ooh, loads of spins! She almost loses but holds it together... and there's even a Dirty Dancing lift in there, plus a few cartwheel lifts. We're exhausted just watching this to be honest. Can we have a lie down?18:44Aww, Georgia's mum has shown up with the family after a bit of a down in the dumps phone call from her daughter. Any mum doing the conga gets our vote. But will Georgia? Well, this salsa has certainly started well - full of energy, and loads of hip action too. It's not perfect but we're really impressed - Georgia has improved loads in our eyes.18:42Right, shall we have our first couple of the night? It's time for Georgia May Foote & Giovanni Pernice! They got their highest score of the series last week, so can they keep it up with the salsa? \"I feel like a sausage,\" Georgia complains. We're not... entirely sure why? © BBC / Ray Burmiston 18:40\"I'm feeling absolutely chipper,\" Len says about his operation. Good news! But here come the 12 celebs still battling it out in the competition... Anton's wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Presumably with Katie as a partner he feels like he's on holiday the entire time.18:39Tess is \"ready to party\" apparently. I mean, we're in our pyjamas but we're game if she is. We might need to smarten up a bit though because here come the judges looking very dapper. Len is in situ waving his arms about - of course, he had knee surgery this week so we'll let him off.18:37Doo-doo-doo-doo-do-do-do...18:36HERE WE GO! Remember, do get involved in the comments and let us know everything you're thinking about the celebs, the dances and the judges...18:35Len Goodman is looking pretty cheery at the moment. We wonder how long that's going to last....@grumpylgoodman is chomping at the bit backstage ready for the start of the show!
