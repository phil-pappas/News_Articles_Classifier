The FCC dangled big number offers to local broadcast TV station owners today. Give up your signals and retire in luxury. What are the most valuable TV stations in town - living or dead? Jonathan Takiff, Inquirer Columnist Posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015, 1:54 PM \nWhat would it be worth to Philly TV stations to go out of business, to give back their frequencies to the Federal Communications Commission for auctioning to mobile phone companies next year? \nThe FCC’s incentive auction bid opening prices came out today – and the numbers are shockingly good for some, mediocre for others. \nLocally, the WPHL TV 17 frequency is most prized – worth $663 million if the broadcaster were to roll over and die, followed by WCAU – NBC10 , valued at almost $647 million if it opted to go \"dark.\" If the stations took the alternative route of relocating to lesser grade VHF frequencies – no loss for the 90 percent of viewers who watch on cable/satellite - what the stations gave up could still be worth a lot of moolah - between $258 and $490 million, EACH. \nThe area’s next most valuable station, surprise, is public broadcaster WYBE TV35 – valued at $585 million to just go away, and still worth plenty – between $234 million and $439 million – if it moves willing to a high or low VHF frequency, respectively. \nBy contrast, WPVI- TV6‘s signal is worth a “mere” $203 million in the FCC’s guesstimation. That’s because it held on to its original VHF channel frequency during the analog-to-digital transition. UHF frequencies are much more desirable in the digital world, especially for pushing mobile phone signals through stubbornly resistant walls of homes and office buildings. \nWhen the bidding process starts, the actual offers will almost surely go down, says Washington, D.C.-based communications attorney Peter Tannenwald. Especially if a large group of stations are willing to consider a sale or relocation of assets. \n“It’s a reverse bidding process,” explained Tannenwald. The bidders say ‘are you still interested in selling if I offer you $450 million? How about if I offer you $400 million?’” The last card players who leave the table win. \nHow aggressively bidders envision their future growth (especially in wireless internet and TV) and crave more bandwidth also will play into the final bids. Sprint has already indicated it will sit out the auction process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:16:26.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
