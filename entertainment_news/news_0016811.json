The Back Bay Competition & Conference competitors from Swing & Sway Dancing in Rockland included Harper Gordon who, at age 17, was the youngest dancer in her level (age 16 to 35). \nGordon, a senior at Camden Hills Regional High School, competed in three levels of American Smooth: in the Pro/Am Silver 2, she danced Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot and Viennese Waltz, winning third place in each; in the Open Silver, she danced the same four dances again, winning second place in each. In the WDSS Closed Sliver American Smooth Scholarship, she won the bronze. \nGordon began dancing when she was 3 years old and has studied ballet, modern, hip-hop and belly dance. Two years ago, she joined Swing & Sway and began dancing with owner/instructor Christian Clayton. She said ballroom the hardest dance form she has ever studied. \nThis was Gordon’s second and last national dance competition she will participate in, as she is getting ready to leave for college next September. Once in college, she would like to join the college dance team as it is a combination of everything she loves — dance, sports and community service. \n 4401, ext. 115;  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:24:48.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
