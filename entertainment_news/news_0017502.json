News. \nWhat's more, a source revealed he is breathing on his own but wears a mask to aid the flow of oxygen and has attempted to speak, though he's mainly using hand signals and giving thumbs up or thumbs down to communicate. \nMeanwhile, the 35-year-old star has reportedly said \"hey baby\" and \"good morning\" to his estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, 31, who has been with him since he was admitted to hospital and has barely left his side. \nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star - who filed for divorce from the athlete in December last year following four years of marriage - has slept by his side since the ordeal. \nThe insider explained: \"Khloe still hasn't left his side and looks very tired. \n\"As soon as Lamar wakes up, she rushes over to hold his hand. She sleeps on a pullout bed next to Lamar.\" \nLast week, an insider said Lamar had suffered \"loss of oxygen but also a possible stroke\" and \"is slowly making progress\" but he's \"not out of the woods yet.\" \nA 911 call made from the brothel confirmed Lamar took cocaine last Saturday and owner Dennis Hof revealed he was taking herbal Viagra and drinking cognac. \nDoctors have reported that Lamar Odom will undergo rehabilitation for \"many months\", telling his close friends and family that his recovery will likely be a long and difficult journey as the amount of permanent damage to his body is yet to be determined. \nA source told gossip website TMZ.com: \"Lamar will have physical, speech, and other therapists working with him for the foreseeable future.'' \nKhloe Kardashian has been by his side since he was admitted to hospital and has promised to support him every step of the way. \nThe insider added: \"She has vowed to stay with him through the entire ordeal ... and that includes all therapy. \n\"She has kept a constant vigil by his bedside so far and she is determined to see this through.\" \nMeanwhile Kim Kardashian West posted this sweet message on her Instagram account: A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:51:31.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
