But when police learn the impoverished victim has a million dollar life insurance policy suspicions arise. Could the beneficiaries, two seemingly innocent grannies, actually be cold blooded killers?\n“Death of a Hollywood Publicist”- While driving home from a movie premiere, successful Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was fatally shot in Beverly Hills. Police zero in on a suspect’s location after receiving a tip that he was bragging about being paid $10,000 to murder the publicist—but before they can make the arrest the suspect commits suicide, leaving the city of Los Angeles wondering who else, if anyone, wanted Chasen dead?\n“Audition for Death”- Aspiring movie actress Kristi Johnson’s dream came to a tragic end when she was murdered and her body discarded in the Hollywood Hills. She had been on her way to audition for what she hoped was the next Bond girl but instead she ran into someone far more nefarious than a movie villain.\n“Movie Theater Massacre”- The Silent Movie Theater is a beloved Hollywood institution—the only movie theater in the world devoted exclusively to silent movies. But the calm silence was abruptly broken when its beloved owner, Laurence Austin, was shot and killed. On the surface it looked like a robbery gone wrong but behind the curtain it was someone much closer who masterminded the hit.\n“Child Actor Killer”- An actor with a string of successes including multiple commercials and a role on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, when Skylar Deleon realized his career was heading nowhere he turned to a life of crime. Although he left a number of bodies in his wake, Deleon became infamous for murdering retired couple Tom and Jackie Hawks while pretending to buy their 55-foot yacht.\n“Robert Blake: Killer?”- On May 4, 2001, Bonny Lee Bakely, the wife of \"In Cold Blood\" and \"Baretta\" star Robert Blake, was gunned down while sitting in Blake’s parked car outside their favorite Italian restaurant. The murder became an immediate media sensation with many pointing the finger at Blake and the actor eventually went bankrupt while defending his name in a case that dragged on for over a decade.\n“Slaughter on the Studio Steps”- Oscar®-winning screenwriter Robert Lees had a turbulent career in Hollywood and at 91 years old he showed no signs of slowing down. But when he was brutally murdered and decapitated inside his Hollywood home—his head found inside a nearby apartment along with his dead neighbor—could the killing be linked to Lees’ past or is it the beginning of a killing spree? The investigation ends with a dramatic takedown on the front steps of Paramount Studios.\n“The Movie That Helped Catch a Killer”- Drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood sends a message by abducting his indebted customer’s 15-year-old brother, Nicholas Markowitz. Nicholas is having the time of his life partying with his kidnappers but, little does he know, the clock is ticking and he’ll soon be dead. The story inspired hit movie \"Alpha Dog\" but during production Jesse James Hollywood was captured, giving producers a new ending to their movie.\n\"Dr. Feelgood\" – Premieres Saturday, November 28 at 10pm ET/ 7pm PT\nWe trust doctors with our lives. They heal us when we’re ill and guide us on a path toward healthy living. In Hollywood being famous doesn’t make you immune to sickness so what happens when the person celebrities entrust with their well-being uses that power to seek fame, make big bucks or execute something far more sinister? REELZ original series \"Dr. Feelgood\" examines the terrible true stories of physicians whose practice led to controversy, mystery and tragedy for their notable clients. Each one-hour episode delves into one celebrity’s search for happiness through physical enhancement, weight loss or performance booster and the prolonged debate that followed. Can doctors in the immediate orbit of celebrities remain objective and clear-headed in their diagnoses and treatments? And where does the responsibility lie: with the client who wanted and took the drugs—or the expert who prescribed them? \"Dr. Feelgood\" is produced by Asylum Entertainment and new episodes will air Saturdays at 10pm ET/ 7pm PT.\nEpisode topics for \"Dr. Feelgood\":\n“Michael Jackson & Dr. Murray”- The premiere episode on November 28 focuses on Dr. Conrad Murray’s catastrophic story—a classic case where the aura of celebrity may have clouded a doctor’s better judgment. What was the true nature of Dr. Murray’s relationship with Michael Jackson and did it go beyond that of doctor and patient? Analysis of that fatal day and an investigation into Jackson’s use of the anesthetic drug Propofol may hold the answers to Dr. Murray’s complicated role in the King of Pop’s death.\n“JFK & Dr. Max” - A physician to global leaders and celebrities, Dr. Max Jacobson’s most famous patient was the 35th President of the United States. With JFK’s seal of approval, New York’s high society and Hollywood’s elite opened their wallets and veins to the syringes of “Miracle Max” as he was known. Did his magic amphetamine-laced elixirs actually influence the course of history? This episode explores the rise and fall of President Kennedy’s Dr. Feelgood.\n“Anna Nicole Smith & Dr. Eroshevich” - A cautionary tale of excess and indulgence, Anna Nicole Smith’s death is a tragic example of how a celebrity’s chaotic lifestyle can overshadow the professional reasoning of those caught in the whirlwind. In 2007 the former Playboy model overdosed on prescription drugs and Anna’s manager and lawyer Howard K. Stern, Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor were accused of conspiring to prescribe the excess drugs.\n“Elvis and Dr. Nick”- The celebrity entourage is an exclusive and coveted group to belong to—and Elvis’ “Memphis Mafia” was no exception. But when Elvis’ doctor Dr. Nichopoulos became a member of the party train, the doctor’s integrity was at stake. Could he ever truly make objective decisions or did he become a yes-man to the star’s growing drug addiction, supplying him with his daily fix?\n“Marion Jones & Victor Conte”- In fall 2007 when Olympic superstar Marion Jones was stripped of her gold medal for having taken performance-enhancing drugs, the man behind the scandal was nutritionist and cocky entrepreneur Victor Conte, the BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Company) founder who had been funneling steroids to famous athletes including Major League Baseball stars Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi from 1988 until 2002.\n“Brian Wilson & Dr. Landy”- Behind Brian Wilson’s Beach Boys fame and gold records was a man suffering from drug addiction, alcohol abuse and mental illness. His family enlisted the aid of radical psychologist Eugene Landy, a doctor with an impressive client list—and unfulfilled aspirations of working in the music business—but the relationship spiraled into psychological abuse, mind games and virtual imprisonment of the rock legend.\n“Howard Hughes & Dr. Thain”- When the effects of debilitating OCD and excruciating chronic pain took hold of Howard Hughes, the American business tycoon and Hollywood honcho became a broken, bed-ridden man addicted to Codeine and Valium. As he sank deeper into a world of addiction and mental illness, could his doctors and closest allies be trusted—or were they actually conspiring against him to take control of his wealth and business assets?\n“Celebrity Wives & Dr. Jiffy Lube”- For wives of a certain age Dr. Daniel Serrano was a miracle worker. With clients including Priscilla Presley, the handsome Argentinean physician promised that, unlike Botox or collagen, the results of his injections would be everlasting. But behind closed doors he was filling their dreams—and faces—with toxic industrial grade silicone instead of the expensive European products he promoted.\nAbout REELZCHANNEL—Hollywood Happens Here\nREELZ is a leading independent cable and satellite general entertainment network, connecting its viewers across America with the magic, wonder and excitement of Hollywood wherever it happens.
