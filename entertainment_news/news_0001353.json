(Harold Filan) Mark Olsen Contact Reporter \nActress Maureen O'Hara died Saturday in Idaho at age 95, but memories of her life were shared from all over the world from stars of all generations. \nStar of such films as \"The Quiet Man,\"\"How Green Was My Valley\" and \"The Parent Trap,\" O'Hara was in Los Angeles for a tribute at the 2014 TCM Film Festival and also received an honorary Oscar at the 2014 Governors Awards. \nActress Jessica Chastain posted a photo of herself with O'Hara, dedicating it \"from one tough redhead broad to another.\" \n\nActress Mia Farrow shared two posts, first declaring O'Hara \"beautiful, kind, strong\" and then including a photo. (Many have frequently mixed up O'Hara over the years with Farrow's mother, actress Maureen O'Sullivan, and some comments online seemed to have made the same mistake. O'Sullivan died in 1998.) \n\nTough guy actor Ron Perlman called O'Hara \"incomparable\" while posting a picture online. \nThe Twitter account for The Retro Set, a classic film blog, posted an undated photo of O'Hara with puppies. \n\nFilmmaker Edgar Wright posted an unusual and knowing tribute to the actress by including a clip from Steven Spielberg's film \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,\" which includes a clip from \"The Quiet Man,\" the John Ford-directed 1952 film starring O'Hara and John Wayne. \nThe clip makes for a fitting nod to the power of movies and why the legacy of a performer such as O'Hara will live on long after they are gone. \nMORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:14:33.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
