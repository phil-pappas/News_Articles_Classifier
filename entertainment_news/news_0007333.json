Sales experience is not required for the part of Willy Loman. But the six actors playing musicians in the world premiere musical \"The Bandstand\" had to be actual musicians, says composer Richard Oberacker.\n\"Since it's about a swing band, those guys have to play, because that's who the characters are,\" Oberacker says.\nMusical theater actors who serve as their own accompanists have become, if not an actual trend, at least a stunt that directors have been using lately to great effect.\nHarry Connick Jr. pounded the keyboards in the 2006 revival of \"The Pajama Game.\" Recent New York revivals of \"Sweeney Todd\" (2005) and \"Allegro\" (2014) featured actors who served as their own onstage orchestra. The latter two productions, helmed by Scottish director John Doyle, actually stemmed from very prosaic necessity, Oberacker points out.\n\"He was coming from a very small theater in England that didn't have enough money for an orchestra,\" he says. \"So he came up with this idea: What if the actors played the score as well? That's very different than what 'The Bandstand' is.\" \nPut another way: The character Mrs. Lovett in \"Sweeney Todd\" isn't a tuba player — though she became one, in effect, when Patti LuPone played her in the 2006 revival. But Donny Novitsky in \"The Bandstand\" is really supposed to be a piano player and bandleader. So Corey Cott, (\"Newsies\") who plays him in \"The Bandstand,\" had to be one, too.\n\"He really sings, plays the piano, he has to act, and he has to legitimately lead the band when he's onstage,\" Oberacker says. \"It's really involved. The casting took a long time to get right.\"\n12-piece pit band, too \nNaturally, no show about swing band musicians would be complete without jitterbug dancers — so theatergoers can expect an eyeful as well as an earful. And in addition to the six musicians onstage (Cott, Joe Carroll, Brandon J. Ellis, James Nathan Hopkins, Geoff Packard, Joey Pero), there is a 12-piece band in the pit. Some of the greatest moments in \"The Bandstand,\" Oberacker says, happen when the two bands join forces.\n\"There are moments in the show where the [actors] play alone, and other moments where they play with the pit orchestra,\" he says. \"And the sound is fantastic. It's such a great effect.\"\n\"The Bandstand,\" directed and choreographed by Tony-winner Andy Blankenbuehler (\"Hamilton,\" \"In the Heights\") and co-starring the Tony Award-winner Beth Leavel (\"The Drowsy Chaperone\"), is more than a jazzy period piece about a group of World War II vets who form a swing band to compete in a radio contest. It also has to do with a transitional moment in American pop culture.\nThe year 1945, when the story takes place, is actually the tail end of the swing era: Changing tastes and (in New York) new cabaret laws helped bring about the decline of 25-piece big bands and the rise of smaller combos playing bebop and rhythm and blues. Moreover — and this is what \"The Bandstand\" is really about, Oberacker says — many returning vets found the happy-go-lucky music of the big bands no longer spoke to them in the wake of their traumatic experiences overseas. They wanted something grittier and more truthful. Which is how America got, ultimately, from Glenn Miller to Bob Dylan.\n\" 'The Bandstand' is really about truth,\" Oberacker says. \"We speak to the fact that the music was changing and this new sound was around the corner, what ultimately would become rock-and-roll, that was going to be done by smaller, scrappier combos. Music started to be more truthful, more youth-oriented and more sexy in some ways, and more rebellious. That's what you see in 'The Bandstand,' even though it's set solidly, squarely in the Forties. You see this group of people, these vets, struggling with how do they tell the truth about what they went through in their music.\"\nThe six vets who form the band find that the music helps them bond, helps them heal, helps give them a voice. But what they're saying is not what the country is ready — yet — to hear, Oberacker says.\n\"The contest and NBC and the nation as a whole, they want comfort, and they want things to go back to the way they were,\" he says. \"They want to forget, gloss over, put the war in a neat little package, up on a shelf. And it turns out that's a little bit at odds — a lot at odds — with what the band needs to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:37:48.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
