Sen is now out of danger.\nWest Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee also paid a visit to enquire about his condition, on the day he was admitted.\nGanguly started his career as a stage actor and later worked in television and films.\nHe acted in acclaimed films like 'Gaynar Baksha' by Aparna Sen, 'Laptop' by Kaushik Ganguly, 'Byomkesh Bakshi' by Anjan Dutta, 'Iti Srikanta' by Anjan Das and 'Mahulbanir Sereng' by Sekhar Das.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:20:39.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
