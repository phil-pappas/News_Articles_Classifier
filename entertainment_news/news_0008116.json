Ecco Press\n, which is a division of Harper Collins , is publishing the book, due out next fall as Lehane is still writing. Lehane will adapt the screenplay for the studio after he is finished with the novel. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but one insider describes it as a Hitchcockian thriller set in Boston . Sources say the new book by Lehane, best known for his New England -based crime dramas like \"Mystic River,\" \"Gone Baby Gone\" and \" Shutter Island ,\" will be unlike anything he has written to date.\nLehane's books have long garnered critical acclaim and commercial success, and the author has recently taken to adapting his own novels, the first being Fox Searchlight's crime drama \"The Drop,\" starring Tom Hardy\n. Lehane has since begun writing scripts not based on his own work, such as the upcoming Travis McGee\npic \"The Deep Blue Good-By\" and the remake of \"The Prophet\" for Neal Moritz\n. Lehane's next novel to be adapted into a feature is \"Live By Night,\" which Ben Affleck\nhas made his next directing gig following his Oscar-winning pic \"Argo.\" Lehane will produce. He is also developing a TV show based on his best-selling novel \"Shutter Island\" for HBO and Paramount Television, which is being described as an origin story for his original novel which was adapted into a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio\n. The film deal was brokered by Amy Schiffman\nat Intellectual Property Group and Jason Hendler\nat Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush & Kaller. Lehane is also represented by Ann Rittenberg\nat the Ann Rittenberg Agency for publishing as well as CAA for TV/screenwriting.\nÂ© 2015 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=6035310&c3=10000&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:07:12.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
