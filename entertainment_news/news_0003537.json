In their eyes, Arabic script is merely a supplementary visual that completes the horror-fantasy of the Middle East.\"\nAs Amin explains, the trio views Homeland as a \"thinly veiled propaganda,\" that promotes fear and mistrust of Muslims of all backgrounds. \"For four seasons and entering its fifth, Homeland has maintained the dichotomy of the photogenic, mainly white, mostly American protector versus the evil and backwards Muslim threat.\"\n\"It was our moment to make our point by subverting the message using the show itself,\" they said.\nWhile producers wish they had paid more attention to what was being written, for the moment they seem okay with the incident and even admire what the artists' were able to accomplish.\n\"We wish we'd caught these images before they made it to air,\" said showrunner Alex Gansa in a statement to Mashable . \"However, as Homeland always strives to be subversive in its own right and stimulus for conversation, we can't help but admire this act of artistic sabotage.\"\nEarlier this month, Homeland star Claire Danes addressed her controversial relationship with Billy Crudup during an appearance on The Howard Stern Show.\n Claire Danes addresses controversial Billy Crudup relationship Claire Danes receives Hollywood Walk of Fame star Watch: 'Homeland' Season 5 trailer is now online", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/arabic-graffiti-accusing-homeland-racism-832336", "http://www.hebaamin.com/arabian-street-artists-bomb-homeland-why-we-hacked-an-award-winning-series/", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://mashable.com/2015/10/15/homeland-is-racist-graffiti/#2wQEQ.s.fuqn"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:49:50.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
