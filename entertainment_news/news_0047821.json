By Katie Martin U pon meeting Stathy Stathopoulos you quickly learn the guy knows his Greek food, and his passion for it shines through each koulouria twist cookie, gyro or bottle of imported olive oil that leaves the doors at Yia Yia’s Kitchen at 3113 Habersham Street.\nStathopoulos opened the kitchen in June 2014 after working at the Savannah Greek Festival and hearing attendees talk about the need for Greek food and products year-round.\n“People said, ‘We wait once a year to come and get Greek stuff and food...,’ there was a demand, but no one was filling that demand, so looking for a new adventure we jumped in and decided to see where it leads to,” he said.\nThe kitchen imports a lot of those items fresh from Hellas Bakery and Restaurant in Tarpon Springs, Fla., along with authentic pita bread, olive oils and feta cheese straight from Greece. While most people think they’ve had Greek yogurt or feta cheese, Stathopoulos said it’s not the good stuff. The difference is in the taste, he said.\n“You see the Greek name on the feta, Athenos, but then you look on the side and it says, ‘made in Wisconsin,’” he said with a laugh, adding that customers won’t find any lettuce in their traditional Greek salad or in their gyros, but instead french fries, which is how they do it in Greece, something that always surprises customers.\n“The biggest thing is we try to bring authentic flavors... It’s not about knockoffs... I’m the biggest critic of my store,” he said. “If I don’t like it, we don’t serve it.”\nStathopoulos is getting ready to expand his small corner store into the adjacent building that most recently housed Ma’s Food Mart. The new market place will sell deli meats, cheeses and a wide assortment of other authentic Greek and Mediterranean products, including a variety of imported beers and wines and their signature sweet tea, which is blended with Greek chamomile.\n“The whole idea is to bring those high-quality items that people can’t find,” he said, adding that he decided to move forward with the expansion after hearing from Ardsley Park residents who wanted more Italian, Greek and Bulgarian products.\nHe said he hopes to have the doors open by the end of this month.\nEven though the kitchen is getting bigger, they’re not losing the neighborhood, old-school atmosphere. You won’t find any Greek flags or typical statues in the shop, but instead shades of blue and golden yellow that Stathopoulos said represents a sunflower, his mother’s favorite flower.\n“We’re trying to capture not just the authentic foods, but more of your old-school style deli... A more neighborhood, authentic-style store... A lot of businesses now lack customer service and we’re trying to provide that customer service and a friendly atmosphere.”\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Yia Yia’s Kitchen\nWhere: 3113 Habersham Street\nInfo: www.yiayiasav.com , 912-200-3796", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14777942.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14777940.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14777940.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14777942.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14777941.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14777943.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14777943.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14777941.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-03T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T13:47:29.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
