This is the fifth film in the fall 2015 series. Hailed by critics as an ecstatically beautiful and exquisitely detailed portrait of the artist as a cantankerous middle-aged man, Mr. Turner offers us a commanding view of a city--London--and a country at the dawn of the modern age and of J.M.W. Turner as a man awed by the new technologies of photography and the railways. Following the groundbreaking landscape artist through a quarter century, director Mike Leigh “succeeds gloriously in finding a way to suggest the numinous quality of Turner’s work, his unique use of light and other elements to suggest the ways in which everything in nature is connected,” according to Leslie Felperin of Hollywood Review. “Mr. Turner addresses the big questions with small moments. It's an extraordinary film, all at once strange, entertaining, thoughtful and exciting,” concludes Dave Calhoun of Time Out. Join the Cinema 10 crowd as we gather to watch this dramatic biography on the big screen. Mr. Turner is 144 minutes long and rated R for some sexual content.
