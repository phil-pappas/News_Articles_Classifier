(AP) — The Kentucky clerk who attracted national attention when she refused to license same-sex marriages has described herself in an email to a supporter as a \"soldier for Christ.\" \nThe Associated Press obtained Kim Davis' emails under the Kentucky open records law. They offer some insight into her state of mind in the weeks leading up to the five nights she spent in jail for defying a federal court order and refusing to issue the licenses. \nShe described the ordeal as \"a firestorm\" and \"chaotic\" and complained that others were trying to \"make a whipping post out of me!!\" \nBut she told supporters she had \"weighed the cost, and will stay the course.\" \nDavis told one correspondent, \"I desire your prayers.

That means it can be played with five notes, like \"Amazing Grace\" and many of the world's folk melodies. In the 15 years since they wrote it, \"In Christ Alone\" has become one of global Christianity's most popular hymns. \nIn concert, Keith Getty lets his wife, Kristyn, take the lead. With a mixture of admiration and humility, he says, \"Part of that is because she's a great singer and I'm a terrible singer, and part of that is she's just more attractive than me.\" \nThe Gettys' latest CD and DVD, \"Joy — An Irish Christmas Tour,\" has been released in advance of this year's Christmas tour, which starts next month. \nSound: (3:06 a.m. audio feed) \nCHURCH KILLING \nBrother beaten inside church testifies against sister \nNEW HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) — A judge has ruled that prosecutors presented enough evidence to warrant grand jury action against the half-sister of two brothers who were beaten, one fatally, at a central New York church. \nNew Hartford Town Justice William Virkler ruled after hearing testimony Wednesday from 17-year-old Christopher Leonard about the attack this month that left him injured and his 19-year-old brother, Lucas, dead. \nTheir half-sister, Sarah Ferguson, is charged with assault and will continue to be held on $50,000 bail. \nThe Leonards' parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, face the most serious charge so far: manslaughter. Three other congregants of the Word of Life Church are also charged with assault. All have pleaded not guilty. \nOneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara says he will ask a grand jury to consider numerous charges in the case.

(AP) — A church bus driver is charged with using cocaine before a crash near Indianapolis in July that killed a 6-year-old boy and injured 11 other people. \nHancock County prosecutors have charged 54-year-old Charles Goodman with causing death when driving while intoxicated by a controlled substance after blood test results showed signs of cocaine use. \nGoodman, of Chicago, was driving a group from Gary's St. Jude Deliverance Center to a religious convention in Ohio on July 28 when the 15-passenger bus went out of control and overturned on Interstate 70. \nCounty Prosecutor Brent Eaton said investigators suspected Goodman was intoxicated because a passenger said he seemed unfocused while driving. \nGoodman also is charged with reckless homicide and driving with a suspended license. He suffered a broken arm and a fractured jaw and has been jailed since he was released from a hospital the week following the crash. \nCHURCH FIRES-ST LOUIS \nSt. Louis police step up patrols after spate of church fires \nST. LOUIS (AP) — St. Louis police are stepping up patrols and trying to develop profiles of possible suspects in a spate of fires that have damaged six churches in largely black neighborhoods during the past two weeks. \nPolice Chief Sam Dotson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the churches damaged during the suspicious fires Oct. 8 through Oct. 18 vary denominationally and are within a few miles of each other. Four are on St. Louis' north side, and two are in nearby Jennings. \nDotson's comments came the same day the reward for information leading to an arrest doubled to $4,000. \nFive of the churches are predominantly black, and one is racially mixed. In each case, the front doors were set on fire, leaving damage that ranged from virtually nothing at one church to the near destruction of another. \nMARIJUANA-RELIGION \nMan pleads guilty to growing pot; religion defense fails \nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — A man has pleaded guilty to a federal marijuana charge in Michigan after failing to convince a judge that he had a religious right to grow pot. \nBranden Barnes of Marshall claims to be a Native American \"medicine man\" who considers marijuana to be a sacrament protected by the First Amendment. But federal Judge Janet Neff rejected the argument. \nThe Grand Rapids Press says Barnes pleaded guilty Tuesday to growing more than 50 marijuana plants. About a year ago, Lansing firefighters responding to a gas leak summoned police, who found 321 plants. \nBarnes said he was a member of a Native American church that accepts people who pay a fee. He will be sentenced on Jan. 28. \nSCHOLARLY BOOKS FRAUD \nMan pleads guilty to fraudulent sale of scholarly books \nBOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts man has pleaded guilty to fraudulently selling non-existent scholastic books to universities, seminaries and churches. \nRichard Stanley Haugh was sentenced Tuesday in U.S. District Court to 20 months in prison, which he has already served, and was ordered to pay $167,883 in restitution. \nHaugh had been indicted on 30 counts mail fraud but fled to Colombia in the early 1990s. He was located in 2014 and extradited to the U.S. \nFrom November 1989 to November 1990, prosecutors say Haugh claimed to be a theology scholar whose company provided translations of rare, early Christian works. Through a mail marketing scheme, he defrauded more than 150 universities, seminaries, churches and individuals. \nAfter his sentencing, Haugh was turned over to Belmont, Massachusetts, police for prosecution on unrelated sexual assault charges. \nPRIESTS HIT BY PAINTBALLS \nPriests hit by paintballs outside Pittsburgh Orthodox church \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — A Pittsburgh church is considering installing surveillance cameras after two visiting priests were hit by paintballs over the weekend. \nThe Rev. Patrick Carpenter is the pastor of Holy Assumption of St. Mary Russian Orthodox Church. \nCarpenter says he and two priests from other churches went to dinner Sunday night. When they returned, someone fired paintballs at Carpenter's friends as he went inside to disable a security system so he could let them in. \nThe priest says his friends weren't badly hurt but were shocked by the attack. Carpenter says he doubts the paintball shooter targeted them because they were priests because the visitors were wearing civilian clothes. \nPolice are hoping a witness will come forward to identify the car or the paintball shooter riding inside it. \nPOLAND-GAY PRIEST \nPolish church suspends priest who is gay and has boyfriend \nWARSAW, Poland (AP) — A Polish priest who lost his job at the Vatican earlier this month after revealing that he is gay and has a boyfriend has been suspended by the church in Poland from performing the functions of a priest. \nKrzysztof Charamsa, 43, came out as gay and criticized the Vatican for its approach to homosexuality on the eve of a major meeting of world bishops in Rome. The Vatican immediately fired him from his job with the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. \nOn Wednesday Charamsa's home diocese of Pelplin said Charamsa has been suspended as a priest for his way of life and can no longer wear priestly vestments. It said the punishment can be reversed if he returns to the \"true teaching of the church and Christ's priesthood.\" \nSPAIN-SAGRADA FAMILIA CHURCH \nBarcelona's Sagrada Familia begins work on immense towers \nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona's breathtaking La Sagrada Familia Basilica has begun its final phase of raising six immense towers that officials say will make it Europe's tallest religious building. \nChief architect Jordi Fauli says the central \"Tower of Jesus Christ,\" the tallest of the six, will be 566 feet high.
