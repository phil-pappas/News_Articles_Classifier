And so, one approaches \"Truth\" with caution. Is it going to be an expose of corporate journalism? Of George W. Bush? Of boardroom sexism? \nInstead, its only agenda seems to be to uncritically support the person on whose memoir, not surprisingly, it's based. It's not a real drama. It's an argument for the defense. It skips who, what, when, where and why and goes straight to whine. \nThe story – probably already forgotten by most in this sped-up age – is how Dan Rather and \"60 Minutes\" went on the air during the 2004 re-election campaign to assert that Bush had not only had strings pulled to get him into the Texas National Guard – and therefore avoid going to Vietnam – but then hadn't even bothered to complete that service. \nNot surprising for anyone who ever sang along with \"Fortunate Son.\" Still, pretty damaging stuff if true – especially for a war-time president running against a real Viet Nam vet. \nExcept the crucial proof was a document slipped to the reporters by a source – a document which, once the show aired, CBS was forced to admit were... um, questionable. That didn't mean it was definitely a forgery, but the uncertainty was enough – several people resigned, segment producer Mary Mapes was fired and Rather decided to retire early. \nThere may be a story there, but the one that novice director James Vanderbilt has chosen is built around the simple idea that Mapes was an exemplary journalist hung out to dry by her corporate overlords. Oh, and that Rather was some sort of golden god of journalism – a point the film drives home by getting Robert Redford to play him, shooting him adoringly, and having awestruck colleagues constantly tell him how wonderful he is. \nThe only thing (almost) rescuing the movie is Cate Blanchett , who plays Mapes. Blanchett has always been good as inconveniently emotional women, characters whose nerves are rubbed raw from constant use. She draws on that here, and her Mapes is a constant agent of drama, whether pushing her colleagues to nail down a piece of the puzzle or crumpling in old pain when dealing with her abusive father. \nYet it's hard to buy her as the more-sinned-against-than-sinning martyr that the movie wants her to be, or to quite accept the movie's version of events. Rather may seem like an old icon now, but believe me, people used to snicker at his folksy aphorisms and wrapped-in-a-trenchcoat grandstanding; Brian Williams wasn't the first \"trusted voice of authority\" to have a dangerously needy ego and taste for publicity. \nSo to have Rather put forward as the universally acknowledged conscience of broadcast journalism feels like a bit of a stretch. And to insist that CBS' team had the story – when a lot of what they had were dubious documents obtained from a less-than-unimpeachable source – probably isn't really the kind of imaginative exuberance this film needs more of. \nSee \"Truth\" if you want to see another fabulous performance from the crackling Cate Blanchett. See \"Truth\" if you're greedy for more Robert Redford movies, or just a little nostalgic for the days when network news really mattered. \nBut don't see \"Truth\" if all you're really desperate to see is truth. \nRatings note: The film contains strong language and some graphic images.
