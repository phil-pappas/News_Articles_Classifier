Twenty-five people, including some students, were taken to area hospitals, Iredell County Medical Director Howard Bell told WBTV.\nThe incident was reported around 2:15 p.m. at North Iredell High School in Olin, North Carolina. Multiple agencies were called to the scene. Firefighters said a large box truck ran into a pre-cast concrete canopy at the school during a band competition, and that some students were trapped.\nIredell County EMS said the injuries ranged from minor to life threatening. Firefighters said there could be up to 20 injured, and sources told WBTV \"all on duty and off duty paramedics\" were called to the scene.\nAccording to the school's website, SATs and the band competition were both happening at the high school.\nIredell-Statesville Schools spokeswoman Susie Wiberg said the Foothills Invitational Marching Band Competition was canceled following the accident. She said the event normally attracts bands from 30 schools, but she said several schools pulled out of this year's competition because of rainy weather.", "external_links": ["http://www.wbtv.com/story/30178385/25-students-others-taken-to-hospital-after-n-iredell-hs-building-collapse"], "published": "2015-10-03T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:47:54.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
