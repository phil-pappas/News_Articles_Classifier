(Beowulf Sheehan) \nBy Elisabeth Egan (Simon & Schuster, 370 pp, $26 \nThose of us who take New Jersey Transit trains into Manhattan daily are identified by confusion over time and light wallets. The misunderstanding about time is because schedules are but a suggestion. \nI realize it is not just New Jersey's fault and that we are in desperate need of a tunnel. Some people, though, know how to make their commutes better. I read. \nElisabeth Egan, of Montclair , used her commute to write this charming novel. By the end of it, I so loved Alice, the main character, that I wished she were real and we were pals. \nThe book chronicles her life over a year, and of course during a year a lot changes. Her husband does not make partner in his law firm and decides to strike out on his own. This means it's time for Alice to land a new job, instead of the comfy, part-time book review gig she has had at a magazine for years. \nAlice has always loved books. Some kids pretend to be teachers or put on shows for their teddy bears. Alice had a book selling game. \n\"I drag my suitcase out from under the bed and start packing. \n\"The Ramona books go in the elastic pocket intended for socks and underwear; the yellow-spined Nancy Drews go in neat towers on the luggage floor. Around these, I wedge in Anastasia Krupnik, Pippi Longstocking, Emily of New Moon, Harriet the Spy, Betsy, Tacy and Tib, the All of a Kind Family.\" This is the book's opening. How can a reader not fall in love with this girl? Alice used to sell her books to her dad. She grew up secure and loved. A beautifully written novel, with believable characters and situations. \nDuring the course of this year, her father, who already had his voice box removed because of cancer, becomes terminally ill. Alice has three children, and as her husband starts drinking way too much, she takes what she initially thinks is a dream job. \nMainStreet is a new wave company, reinventing what was once town centers. Alice is seduced by the notion of wonderful bookstores, with luxurious chairs outfitted with coffee warmers. \nShe works for a smug, younger boss in pristine white offices where no one is supposed to use paper, pen or exclamation points in email. (They do get annoying!!) \nAlice buys in to a longer commute and hands over more childcare decisions to her sitter and husband, yet she misses the constant thrum of being a mom. \n\"But I wanted to know more than the important stuff about my kids: I wanted to know the little things, too. And I wanted to have a job where I earned a respectable paycheck and was an active participant in meetings and could occasionally hang out in the office kitchen talking about Sharon Olds and Anne Sexton.\" Still, she's enthused about these proposed bookstores until those plans are dashed. The new reality has her poring over spreadsheets about video games. Video games she abhors and would never let her children play: Exactly how is a game educational or even acceptable when players fly planes into buildings? \nAlice dares tell the CEO what she thinks, when she visits the home offices in Cleveland, where her in-laws live. \n\"I'd driven by the corporate campus many times, but now my blue employee pass allowed me into MainStreet's inner sanctum for the first time. It consisted of a handful of eight-story waterfront buildings bedecked with solar panels and flanked by special short water fountains for dogs, which were welcome to come to work with their owners. All shrubbery was cleverly groomed with a patriotic theme. In the short walk around the place, I spotted topiaries in the shape of Uncle Sam, the Liberty Bell, and of course, a giant dollar bill.\" The job was always a bad fit for Alice, and she eventually sees that. She also sees clearly that her marriage is on the rocks, mainly because of Nicholas' drinking, but Alice has a solid foundation â€“ with her parents, her husband, her children and herself. \nIt's a joy to experience the year with Alice, to see her come into herself and by the end to wonder what happens next. Given that I am writing this on a stalled New Jersey Transit train, perhaps Egan is on another, already plotting Alice's next move. If not, this is a fine book on its own.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:37:47.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
