Thanks to a public hungry for this style of preparation, the chain with humble Ohio roots now has a store in every state in the U.S. and continues its expansion across the globe with a simple recipe — watch sports, drink beer and eat wings.\nIncreasingly many renowned chefs in some of the hottest kitchens in the U.S. are choosing to also cash in on the dish’s popularity, giving the humble chicken wing a high-end fine-dining makeover — and they’re not the only ones looking to capitalize.\nWith plenty of options to choose from, there’s no shortage of choice. First, there’s the variety of sauces (spicy, savory, tangy, sweet, barbecue, garlic, dry rubbed, etc.) the preparation of the meat (marinated, skin on or off, and the all important regular or boneless), the different batters that are applied, the cooking technique (deep fried, char-grilled, smoked, etc.) and the final flavorful product that all of these cooking combinations net.\nBecause there is so much variety, the mighty chicken wing is a very personal dish. When someone has a favorite it’s unflinching, and it seems nearly everyone has their own individual perspectives and opinions on the subject.\nLocally, the “Kickin’ Chicken Wingfest” that took place for the fifth consecutive year over the summer at Lincoln Park Civic Commons saw almost a dozen Dayton restaurants putting their spin on this tasty staple for more than 10,000 guests who turned out to sample their creations, according to the Miami Valley Restaurant Association.\nPast winners include Romer’s Bar and Grille in Bellbrook, Nick’s Restaurant in Xenia, Bunker’s Bar and Grill in Vandalia, Archers Tavern in Centerville and Pies and Pints Craft Pizza and Beer at The Greene. I am in agreement that all have really terrific wings worth seeking out.\nMy favorite chicken wings in town are the smoked wings at Company 7 BBQ in Englewood (5 for $3.99, 10 for $7.99, 15 for $11.99 or 20 for $15.99). These wings are tossed with a special spicy rub and then slow-smoked for hours on end leaving them tender on the inside and crisp on the outside with a smoky essence that keeps me coming back for more. They are flash fried to order, which crisps them up even more. There’s no fat on them, because it’s been sealed and cooked into the meat, which is my idea of perfection. They can be eaten easily without sauce or you can mix up something at the table from the six signature sauces the restaurant features. A mixture of “Captain Carolina” (vinegar and mustard based Carolina BBQ sauce) with Frank’s Red Hot turned out to be incredibly satisfying, but all of their award-winning sauces are worth trying.\n“People love chicken wings. They are small and come with a variety of sauces, so there is something for everyone,” said Amy Zahora, executive director of the MVRA.\nThe National Chicken Council estimated earlier this year that Americans devoured 1.25 billion chicken wings during the Super Bowl alone. The sales on Goldbely, an online site that ships specialty dishes from famed restaurants and specialty shops, increased more than 10 times during the Super Bowl, with much of that traffic attributed to customers ordering wings from Buffalo, N.Y.’s famed Anchor Bar.\nWe may not see eye to eye on the best wing, but we can agree that most of us love them.\nSince it all comes down to individual taste, the question I’d love to have answered is what are your favorites?\nDayton Eats looks at the regional food stories and restaurant news that make mouths water.
