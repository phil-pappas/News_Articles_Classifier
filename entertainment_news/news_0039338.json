Speaking about the event, one of the students, Rex Joseph, who was the crowd’s favorite in the Dance category said it was a relief to take time out from preparing for and writing examinations to relax at an event sparked with such fun and excitement. “We should do this from time to time. I have been very refreshed by Sprite today,” he said excitedly . Another star performer, Nwachukwu Lilibeth, a 100-level Undergraduate student in the Department of Fisheries, who participated in Basketball, expressed her delight saying, “I am so excited! This is actually the first gift I have ever won in my life, and I am happy it came from Sprite.” \nPresent at the event was Otse John, who had been discovered through Sprite Triple Slam a few years ago and now plays professionally for Dodan Warriors Basketball Club said, “I was in 100 level in the University then. After the regional competitions, where I emerged as the winner, I progressed to the finals which held in Lagos. It was while playing in Lagos that I was approached to play in the Nigerian league, and since then, my life has never been the same.” \nThe event which preceded its UNICAL version reached its climax with a musical performance by Vector da Viper, who got the audience on their feet as he stepped on the stage, practically sending the students screaming and dancing all through his performance. Taking his performance to yet another level, Vector called on the two persons who had emerged tops in the Music category and invited them to join him on stage. \nAlso on stage to perform were Oghenen and Nanya O, who alongside Vector, sent the students to a dancing frenzy . Vector expressed satisfaction with the impressive turnout and good crowd engagement, as he commended Sprite for giving Nigerian youths a platform to express themselves. According to him, the Sprite Triple Slam concept is a unique, cool and laudable one. “This event is different from what you see around. You know, Basketball is somewhat similar to Rap. It’s all about the attitude of both of them.” \nSpeaking about the event, Assistant Brand Manager, Flavours, Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited, Olajumoke Oyewole reaffirmed that Sprite is committed to providing a unique platform that allows for self-expression by its consumers – the Sprite Triple Slam. According to Oyewole, Sprite Triple Slam offers Nigerian teens and youths a unique avenue to express themselves in the three youth passions of Basketball, Music and Dance. “Sprite is all about the attitude and authentic self-expression of our teens, which is fully embodied in Sprite Triple Slam.” \nSprite Triple Slam is targeted at youths in Nigeria, and will be brought to life in many Nigerian University campuses this year. The activation is designed to give Nigerian teens and youths the opportunity to creatively express the fresh, free-spirited, original, spark-up creativity and high level of ingenuity embedded in them.
