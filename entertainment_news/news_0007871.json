(Netflix via AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Netflix hasn’t broken the theatrical mold with its first feature film, “Beasts of No Nation.” The online streaming service debuted the film, about a child soldier in Africa from director Cary Fukunaga, on its platform and in 31 theaters on Friday. \nNumbers have not and likely won’t be released for just how many Netflix subscribers streamed the film this weekend, but the theatrical numbers are not impressive. “Beasts of No Nation” brought in $50,699 from the 31 locations for a $1,635 per-theater average. \nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box office tracker Rentrak, says the film was “more of a test case scenario” and “was going to have a rough go in theaters anyway.” \nBleecker Street handled the theatrical release. The film cost $6 million to produce. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:27:27.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
