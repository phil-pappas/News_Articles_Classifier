COURTESY OF ZOFO Related article » If you go When: 2 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25\nWhere: Living Hope Baptist Church, 433 S. San Jacinto St., Hemet\nAdmission: $30 for a single concert; $55 for the season. Guests ages 22 years and younger receive free admission.\nInformation: 951-927-1775; hemetconcerts.org\nHemet Community Concert Association is breaking one of its rules for the season-opening concert on Sunday, Oct. 25: never repeat a performer within a short time period. Less than two years since their last performance for the group, ZOFO piano duet will return to present other-worldly music in a program titled “ZOFORBIT.”\n“They played for us in January of 2014, and everybody loved it and insisted we bring them back right away,” said Diane Mitchell, artistic director for the organization. “So here they are.”\nZOFO stands for 20 Finger Orchestra, with the Z and O representing the number 20 and F and O representing Finger Orchestra. Eva-Maria Zimmermann and Keisuke Nakagoshi joined forces in 2009; made their Carnegie Hall debut in 2010; and received two Grammy Award nominations in 2013. The duo performs exclusively piano duets of 20th and 21st-century repertoire.\n“Modern music is sometimes a hard-sell, but their lively and charming charisma thoroughly engaged the audience,” said Mitchell. “They will talk about their music just the right amount.”\nThe concert program is taken directly from the performers’ third album, “ZOFORBIT,” and will be performed over 65 minutes without intermission. According to Mitchell, ZOFO will perform excerpts from outer space-themed works by Gustav Holst, Urmas Sisask, George Crumb, and David Lang, using Holst's “The Planets” as the core, and interspersing the other works to take listeners from one planet to the next on a musical journey through outer space. Mitchell said the performers use inside-the-piano techniques like strumming, plucking, hitting strings and muting which add outside-the-world sound effects.\nFollowing the piano program, the performers will take a break, then return for a question and answer session with the audience.\nSunday’s program will be the first in the association’s season, which resumes on Jan. 24 with Chatham Baroque, another repeat performer.\n“This group is all strings with guitars, lutes, violins, and more, accompanied by percussion,” said Mitchell, adding that the program, titled “Mediterranean Odyssey,” will feature music from Italy, France, and Spain.\n“Here's another rule we're breaking this season,” she said. “We do not hire talented kids - we're all about top professional talent, yet we're bringing clarinetist Andrew Moses and cellist Yoshika Masuda for the Feb. 21 concert. When I first saw Moses, he was 11 years old and all you could see was his feet and the music stand. He's about 16 now, and honestly, he has the spirit of Benny Goodman. His music is so accessible for the listener because of the joy he brings to his performance.”\nThe March 20 concert will bring Trio Celeste to the stage. The piano, violin and cello ensemble has promised to perform at least one lush romantic piece by Brahms.\nThe season will close on April 17 with Calle Sur who will bring music from all over Latin America. \"They are wonderful singers with wonderful music, and the two of them totally fill the stage with instruments,\" said Mitchell.\nContact the writer: features@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwlgfo-b88546834z.120151021163802000g6rcnfk4.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwlgfo-b88546834z.120151021163802000g6rcnfk4.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:28:41.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
