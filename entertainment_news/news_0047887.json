Maybe so, but the Nobel Prizes have a way of sparking ferocious debate about whether the winners were worthy or whether the judges' decisions were politically biased.\nPrize founder Alfred Nobel gave only vague instructions on how to select winners, leaving wide room for interpretation by the prize committees in Stockholm and Oslo.\nAhead of this year's prize announcements, which begin Monday with the medicine award, here's a look at some of the most controversial winners since the first Nobel Prizes were handed out in 1901:\n1935 PEACE PRIZE\nIn hindsight few would question the rightfulness of honoring Carl von Ossietzky, a German pacifist writer who was imprisoned by the Nazis for exposing Germany's secret rearmament.\nAt the time, though, the award was highly controversial and seen as interfering with Germany's internal politics and provoking the Nazi regime.\nTwo committee members resigned and Norway's royal family didn't attend the award ceremony, probably because of pressure from the Norwegian government, which feared German repercussions.\nAdolf Hitler was furious. Not only was Ossietzky refused permission to receive the prize, but the Nazi leader prohibited all Germans from receiving any Nobel Prizes during his rule.\n1970 LITERATURE PRIZE\nGiving the prize to Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn at the height of the Cold War was bound to spark a political reaction, even though the prize judges have always insisted their decisions are based only on literary merit.\nSolzhenitsyn, who exposed the horrors of Soviet slave labor camps, was seen as an enemy of the regime in Moscow, which denounced the prize as a hostile act.\nSolzhenitzyn decided not to leave the Soviet Union to receive his prize, fearing authorities wouldn't let him back in. He accepted the award four years later after he was exiled from the Soviet Union.\n1973 PEACE PRIZE\nU.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese leader Le Duc Tho were honored for their efforts to achieve a cease-fire in the Vietnam War in what's become one of the most contentious awards in Nobel history.\nThe Vietnamese leader refused to accept the award, Kissinger asked the U.S. ambassador to Norway to accept it for him, and the war dragged on for three more years.\nThe prize was heavily criticized, particularly by those who opposed the Vietnam War and associated Kissinger with it.\nTwo members resigned from the Norwegian Nobel Committee in protest.\n1976 ECONOMICS PRIZE\nHundreds of demonstrators protested in Stockholm when influential economist Milton Friedman collected his award — one of the most controversial prizes in the economics category.\nFriedman was a proponent of free markets who saw the government's main role as to stabilize the supply of money. His views were controversial among those who believed the government should play a bigger role in the economy.\nLeft-wing protesters were also angered by Friedman's visit to Chile where they said the regime of dictator Augusto Pinochet had been inspired by Friedman's economic theories.\n1994 PEACE PRIZE\nThe award to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres was meant to give a boost to peace efforts in the Middle East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:25:15.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
