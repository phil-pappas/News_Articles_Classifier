But that's not the case,\" Sherrie Westin told People Magazine . \n\"We want to create greater awareness and empathy.\" \nJulia won't feature in the Sesame Street television show but she will be included in digital and printed storybooks. \n\"Families with autistic children tend to gravitate toward digital content, which is why we created Julia digitally,\" said Ms Westin. \n\"We want parents and children to understand that autism isn't an uncomfortable topic.\" \nSesame Street is also producing online tools as part of its See Amazing in All Children initiative, to help people affected by autism manage everyday activities. \nTheir guides, aimed at families with children aged between two and five, include ones on brushing your teeth, visiting a restaurant and crossing the road. \nAlthough aimed at people in the US, the resources are also available to audiences in the UK. \nThere are around 700,000 people in the UK diagnosed with autism, according to The National Autistic Society. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:31:30.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
