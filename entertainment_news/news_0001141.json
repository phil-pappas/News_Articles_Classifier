(Jason Kempin/Getty Images) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter 'I Am Cait' gets a second season from E! \n\"I Am Cait\" has been renewed for Season 2, Variety has learned of Caitlyn Jenner's E! docuseries. The second season will premiere next year. \nThe first season of \"I Am Cait\" followed Jenner, as she navigated her new life living as a transgender woman, while advocating for the transgender community. \n\"I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation,\" Jenner, who serves as an exec producer on the show, said of gearing up for Season 2. \n\"I Am Cait\" was among the top new cable series of last summer, averaging 2.13 million viewers and a 0.98 rating in adults 18-49, according to Nielsen's \"live plus-3\" ratings. It bowed big in late July before falling in subsequent weeks, but its steady numbers over the course of its final four episodes, and an uptick for its finale, likely cinched the show's renewal. \nThough the ratings were not stellar, the series garnered considerable buzz and launched a groundbreaking television trend in trans programming. The first season aired in 153 countries in 24 languages. \nAfter a somewhat awkward exchange on \"Ellen\" last week, Caitlyn Jenner now says she supports gay marriage. \nLet's talk about why that matters. \nWhy should we care that a woman who makes her living raising Kardashians on reality TV (as opposed to, say, working as a county clerk ) has publicly evolved... \nAfter a somewhat awkward exchange on \"Ellen\" last week, Caitlyn Jenner now says she supports gay marriage. \nLet's talk about why that matters. \nWhy should we care that a woman who makes her living raising Kardashians on reality TV (as opposed to, say, working as a county clerk ) has publicly evolved... (Heidi Stevens) \n\"Caitlyn's story has ignited a global conversation on the transgender community on a scale that has never been seen before,\" said Jeff Olde, E!'s exec vice president of programming and development. \"We are honored Caitlyn has chosen to continue to share her ongoing evolution with our viewers around the world.\" \n\"I Am Cait's\" eight-episode season premiered this past July, after Jenner -- who then went by Bruce -- did a sit-down interview with Diane Sawyer on \"20/20,\" in which he came out as transgender, stating, \"For all intents and purposes, I am a woman.\" \nAfter the televised interview, which brought in 17 million viewers, E! aired a two-part special \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians: About Bruce,\" giving the famous family a chance to give their side of the story. The Kardashian/Jenner clan, however, has no ties to \"I Am Cait,\" though the cable net is home to their successful reality franchise. Jenner made her debut as Caitlyn on the cover of Vanity Fair in June, and was honored with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs Awards in July. \n\"I Am Cait\" hails from Bunim/Murray Productions. Along with Jenner, exec producers include Gil Goldschein, Jeff Jenkins, Farnaz Farjam, Andrea Metz and Melissa Bidwell. \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:41:55.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
