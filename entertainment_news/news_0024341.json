PETERSBURG, Fla. – A Pinellas County circuit judge has ruled that several pieces of evidence related to the Hulk Hogan sex tape case will remain confidential despite a request from a group of media outlets that they be made public. \nOf the 17 items discussed Thursday during a hearing, Judge Pamela Campbell determined that 15 will remain sealed, one will be unsealed and one pushed to a later discussion. \nHogan, a former WWE wrestler whose real name is Terry Bollea, is suing the news website Gawker. \nHogan claims that the media company’s decision to publish an excerpt from a sex tape violated his privacy. The video involves Hogan and Heather Cole, the ex-wife of radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. \nHogan is demanding $100 million in damages.
