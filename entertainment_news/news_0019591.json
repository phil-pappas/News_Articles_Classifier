The initiative also is aimed at helping those who deal with the developmental disorder.\nJulia will be included in digital and printed story books featuring Sesame Workshop characters including Elmo and Abby.\nShe will be portrayed as a girl who \"does things a little differently\" when playing with her Muppet friends, the workshop said.\nThe new initiative, called \"See Amazing in All Children,\" will provide educational resources about autism to teachers and others. It also will offer tools for handling everyday activities to families touched by it.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.SesameStreet.org/Autism\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
