Kenan Thompson eventually played Cosby in the revived sketch. \n\"I totally understood,\" he said, addressing the situation for the first time in an interview with the Washington Post. \"It was the biggest thing in the news at the time. I can see why they thought it would be funny, and the sketch that Norm [Macdonald] wrote was hysterical.\" \nDespite the timelines of the topic, Murphy said he couldn't stomach making jokes out of such a serious matter. \n\"It's horrible,\" he continued. \"There's nothing funny about it. If you get up there and you crack jokes about him, you're just hurting people. You're hurting him. You're hurting his accusers. I was like, 'Hey, I'm coming back to 'SNL' for the anniversary, I'm not turning my moment on the show into this other thing.'\" \nCosby thanked Murphy for his decision to decline the sketch. \n\"I am very appreciative of Eddie, and I applaud his actions,\" Cosby said in February. \nMacdonald revealed on Twitter a few days after the episode aired that Murphy rejected the show's offer to Cosby the night before the telecast. \n\"He will not kick a man when he is down,\" Macdonald said of Murphy. \"Eddie Murphy, I realize, is not like the rest of us. Eddie does not need the laughs.\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:12:49.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
