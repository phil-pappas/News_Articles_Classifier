I'm over it at the moment,\" he says. \"We're done. All I want to do is move on. For at least a year or two, I just don't want to think about it. \n\"I don't know what the next step is. I've no idea. Not because I'm trying to be cagey. Who the f**k knows? At the moment, we've done it. I'm not in discussion with anybody about anything. If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\" \nAnd Craig suggests it might be time for the Bond bosses to start looking for another 007, adding, \"The best acting is when you're not concerned about the surface. And Bond is the opposite of that. You have to be bothered about how you're looking. \n\"It's a struggle. I know that how Bond wears a suit and walks into a room is important. But, as an actor, I don't want to give a f--- about what I look like!\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:07:13.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
