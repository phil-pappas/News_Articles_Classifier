After bricks and bullets fly, the sheriff gives the two older Kopps revolvers and shows them how to shoot. When a menacing letter signed H.K. & Co. demands $1,000 or else murder, kidnapping and arson will ensue, Constance waits with a concealed gun.\nStewart says she fell in love with the Kopp sisters, who took over her life as she dug through newspaper archives, census records, property deeds, birth certificates, courthouse documents and family member interviews to pull their lost story together. Where she knew what really happened, Stewart uses it. When she doesn’t, she makes stuff up.\nHer skill as a writer and her affection for the sisters imbues them with a palpable humanity. First-person narrator Constance is interested in justice, not marriage, housekeeping or farm work; anti-social and opinionated Norma is given to racing homing pigeons and reading horror stories aloud; wildly creative Fleurette is a theatrical, fashion-conscious magnet for trouble.\nThey seem like real people, not period paper dolls, as they chop at an old elm that fell across the barn door in a storm, melt icicles from the porch for water when the pump freezes, and walk barefoot in the surf at the bathing beach in New Rochelle for Fleurette’s 17th birthday.\nStewart conjures a sense of mores and life in early 20th-century New Jersey with events like the Paterson silk strike in 1913, when mill owners tried to increase hours and workloads without increasing pay. On strike for six months, workers sent their children to sympathetic families in New York City when they couldn’t afford to feed them.\nIf nasty Kaufman is rather a stock villain, Sheriff Robert Heath, who enlists the sisters to help nab their attacker, is not your average lawman. But then Stewart, whose musician father, Vic Stewart, toured with Doc Severinsen’s road band and whose mother, Dee, worked in public relations in Dallas-Fort Worth and briefly at the Arlington Citizen-Journal , is not your average author.\nWho else would have a “Poison Garden” with 30 varieties of toxic plants such as foxglove, monkshood and castor bean growing by her home in the redwood country of Northern California?\nWho else takes a vacation from writing and once a year spends time painting in New York City, then posts the art on her website (amystewart.com) with a map locating the scenes? And, oh yes, she also paints portraits of chickens, mostly her own hens.\nFinally, who else says that book-tour events are more fun when cocktails are served, then creates the New Jersey Automobile Cocktail, which, she says, pairs perfectly with Girl Waits With Gun . Ingredients for the sparkling concoction adapted from a circa 1910 cocktail are listed under Media on her website.\nFans who want to read more about the cinematic Kopp sisters are in luck. Stewart reportedly has worked a deal with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for a series about Deputy Sheriff Constance, who goes on to form a detective agency with Norma and Fleurette.\nJane Sumner is a freelance writer in Austin.\nGirl Waits With Gun Amy Stewart (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $27)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:56:56.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
