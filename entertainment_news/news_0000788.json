This women’s vocal arts ensemble will perform their critically-acclaimed and wildly popular winter holiday program, showcasing seasonal music from a wide variety of Eastern European ethnic and spiritual traditions. For countless centuries, people around the world have utilized the power of community singing to infuse warmth, cheer, spirituality, wishes for peace, health, and good fortune into the long, dark, cold and difficult winter season. Kitka's program features songs ranging from rousing Slavic folk carols and Caucasus Georgian hallelujahs; to lush meditative Eastern Orthodox sacred choral works and Bosnian-Muslim devotional hymns; from Yiddish, Sephardic, and Hebrew songs for Chanukah and Baltic pagan incantations for the return of the Sun Goddess, to rhythmic Balkan Romany tunes for the winter festivals. Traditional pieces will be woven together with new folk song arrangements and original compositions, all inspired by the customs, beauty, and mystery of wintertime.\nVIDEO\nKITKA’s songs are hauntingly beautiful, simple, yet otherworldly.
