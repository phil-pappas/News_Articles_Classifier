The \" Saturday Night Live \" alum announces \" Tracy Morgan: Picking Up the Pieces \" tour that is expected to start in February 2016 until the end of May. The former \" 30 Rock \" actor will kick off his stand-up comedy tour on February 5 at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana. His tour stops also include Vermont, Ontario, and Hawaii. He describes the tour as getting back on a bike after falling down, \"You don't forget where the pedals are.\" On Twitter, he wrote, \"Heading back out on the road to bring the funny.\" Morgan was hospitalized in June 2014 after a truck crashed into a van occupied by him and his entourage in New Jersey. His friend, fellow comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair, was killed in the collision. He has been gradually returning to stage, making a surprise appearance at Emmys and comedy clubs in New York. Last weekend, he hosted \"SNL\" and joked about his car crash. \"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?' \" he quipped during his monologue. \"The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:50:44.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
