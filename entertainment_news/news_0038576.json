I'm a very open book.\"\nNonetheless, promotional material for \"Homage\" - the name of their Nov. 4 show at Feinstein's/54 Below - notes that Willis shares the stage with \"her 'mystery man.'\"\nIt goes on to note that they'll \"attempt to explain their journey as nonsexual life partners in song.\"\n\"We wanted people to know that we don't take ourselves too seriously,\" adds Blue, who's toured in \"Rent\" and \"Hair.\"\nThe pair's show will feature jazzy standards and more contemporary songs. The set list now includes \"Bang Bang,\" \"You Don't Own Me\" and Amy Winehouse's \"Valerie.\"\n\"We're still figuring it out,\" says Blue, who's sharing an Upper West Side apartment with Willis while she's in New York. Then it's back to their home in Los Angeles.\nAs head of Willis' Black Sparrow Productions, he's charge of ordering business cards, booking concerts and, he says, \"helping her build her brand.\"\nAt 27, she's expanding beyond being the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.\nShe's a \"Dancing with the Stars\" champ as well as Broadway's latest Roxie Hart in \"Chicago.\" She wraps that run on Nov. 1.\nThey're reprising \"Homage\" in L.A. Nov. 12 and Nov. 15.\nThey've been BFFs for a couple years - since meeting while they were both working on a show at Rockwell Table & Stage in California.\n\"We were coworkers,\" says Blue, \"and she needed an assistant. I was available. And she loved me. What makes it work? It's hard to pinpoint. But we click mentally.\"\n\"We're very different,\" he continues. \"I come from a smalltown. She comes from where she comes from - a famous family.\"\nWhich led to a different report that described Blue as a phantom love interest.\n\"There was also an article saying that I was 'Demi's mystery man,'\" says Blue. \"I was in the audience next to her during 'Dancing with the Stars.'\"\nWell, that explains it.\njdziemianowicz@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories ‘DWTS’ alum Rumer Willis, Chris Soules spark romance rumors Celebs who have remained on good terms after Splitsville Rumer Willis makes Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in ‘Chicago' Tags: rumer willis , broadway", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:48:37.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
