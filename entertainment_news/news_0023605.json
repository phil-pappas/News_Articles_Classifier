Vesnivka commissioned Canadian Ukrainian composer Roman Hurko to write a new liturgy in the Eastern Rite, Byzantine tradition to mark the choir's milestone 50th season.\nVesnivka is renowned for its extensive repertoire of Ukrainian classical, folk, contemporary and sacred music - and it regularly commissions new works to showcase the talents of Canadian and Ukrainian composers. Established in 1965 by founder, choral and artistic director Halyna Kvitka Kondracki , the choir has earned a reputation for musical and performance excellence at home and abroad. Vesnivka attracts audiences from diverse cultures who love the choral tradition, the beautiful music, and the choir's high-energy performances.\nThe choir, whose members are all amateur singers, has travelled extensively, performing in major concert venues including Vatican City , London's Royal Albert Hall , New York's Carnegie Hall, as well as Koerner Hall in Toronto . Other highlights include concert tours in Canada , Ukraine , Spain , Portugal , France , Poland , England , and The Netherlands .\nDuring its storied history, Vesnivka has earned numerous awards including top honours in the CBC Choral Competition, first place in the folk category at the International Choral Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales in 1993, and silver at the first Choral Olympics in Linz, Austria in 2000.\nVesnivka has collaborated with many leading Canadian choirs and ensembles including the Orpheus Choir, the Amadeus Choir, the Victoria Scholars, the Toronto Children's Chorus, the Gryphon Trio, and the Elmer Iseler Singers, who are among the featured performers at Vesnivka's Gala concert next spring at the Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto .\n\"Over the past 50 years, Vesnivka members have brought countless choral works to life, and I'm immensely proud of their passion and commitment,\" says Kondracki. \"It's no small accomplishment for a group of busy women with careers and families to find the time to learn and perform new compositions and arrangements both in Canada and abroad.\"\nThe world premiere of Liturgy No. 4 (Vesnivka) will take place on Sunday, October 18, 2015 at 3 p.m. at St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church on Queen Street West and Bellwoods Avenue in Toronto .\nAs part of its legacy project, the choir is making its musical archive available online this fall. A Best of Vesnivka compilation will be released on CD and iTunes later this year. An annual Ukrainian Christmas concert in January 2016 and the 50th Anniversary Gala concert in April 2016 will be among the highlights of the celebrations.
