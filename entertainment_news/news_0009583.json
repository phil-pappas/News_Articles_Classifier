It's a combination of going out to eat in a casual dining setting and moviegoing all wrapped up into one.

It would be like anything else, we try to protect the experience for our customers. If we got complaints that someone had over-imbibed, we would address it.\"\nNew movie theater that serves beer and food coming to Trexlertown Scott Kraus and Ryan Kneller How many times have you rushed through your dinner and chugged your drink, just so you can make it to the theater in time to claim good seats for the latest Hollywood blockbuster?\nA new chain of theaters coming to Trexlertown has a fix for that.\nThe Dallas-based Movie Tavern announced Wednesday...\nHow many times have you rushed through your dinner and chugged your drink, just so you can make it to the theater in time to claim good seats for the latest Hollywood blockbuster?\nA new chain of theaters coming to Trexlertown has a fix for that.\nThe Dallas-based Movie Tavern announced Wednesday...\n(Scott Kraus and Ryan Kneller) Q: Doesn't all the eating and drinking and waiting tables get in the way of the movie experience?\nA: \"For the most part, because it is reserved seating, our guests come in and arrive a few minutes early during the pre-show or the trailers. The majority of customers have that service prior to or just at the beginning of the movie. Beyond that we have a pretty intensive training program. Our servers have electronic hand-helds, so they are trained to be unobtrusive and quick and efficient, orders are transmitted directly to the kitchen. Service is done via the architecture of extra-wide aisles, spaces in-between rows. Each seat is equipped with its own swivel table with that is connected to an armrest with an electronic call button. Servers respond to the call button when a customer wants to order more food or drink.\"\nMOVIE TAVERN / HANDOUT Movie Tavern, which is coming to Trexlertown in 2016, is a \"combination of going out to eat in a casual dining setting and moviegoing all wrapped up into one,\" says Danny DiGiacomo, the company's marketing director. \"The concept is really about enjoying a wide selection of options from the menu, plus everything from a full bar, all with the service right at your seat.\"\nMovie Tavern, which is coming to Trexlertown in 2016, is a \"combination of going out to eat in a casual dining setting and moviegoing all wrapped up into one,\" says Danny DiGiacomo, the company's marketing director. \"The concept is really about enjoying a wide selection of options from the menu, plus everything from a full bar, all with the service right at your seat.\"\n(MOVIE TAVERN / HANDOUT) Q: Do you need reservations?\nA: \"The best way to come to Movie Tavern is to purchase your tickets in advance online so you can reserve your seat.\" Walk-ins are welcome, however, assuming there are seats available.
