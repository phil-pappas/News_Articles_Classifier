Director J.J. Abrams and a slew of cast and crew were on hand to unveil the latest teaser for the new Star Wars film — the seventh in the franchise since director George Lucas' 1977 original. Brian Truitt, USA TODAY 1:43 p.m. EDT October 18, 2015 The new movie poster for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" features new and old heroes plus a major menace. (Photo: Lucasfilm) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \n( USA TODAY ) -- The heroes are front and center on the new movie poster for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , though a major menace also looms large in the galaxy far, far away. \nThe major players, from new characters Ren (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) to old stalwarts Han Solo (Harrison Ford, with his old sidearm) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher, with a fresh hairdo) to the masked lightsaber-wielding villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), are part of the final marketing push for director J.J. Abrams' blockbuster-in-waiting, in theaters Dec. 18. \nIn addition to dropping the poster online Sunday, Lucasfilm announced that the final trailer will debut at halftime of ESPN's Monday Night Football (8:15 ET/5:15 PT) on Monday and tickets go on sale online after the trailer launch for The Force Awakens as well as for a seven-movie marathon event at theaters across the country on Dec. 17. \nThere are some very familiar faces for Star Wars fans in the poster, with Chewbacca and loyal droids C-3PO and R2-D2, sharing space with the round new robot BB-8, X-wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and a mysterious character hanging out by R2. (That could be Maz Kanata, an alien created via motion capture by Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o.) \nThe bad guys are in full force as well, with Driver's Kylo the biggest presence on the artwork and looking intimidating. Also, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is flanked by a pair of First Order Stormtroopers, who also line the bottom of the poster along with Flametroopers and others in battle formation. \nThis is Star Wars , so there's lots of vehicles to be had, with flying X-wings, a trio of TIE Fighters strafing the Millennium Falcon, and a pair of sizable Star Destroyers. \nAlso of note: There is a large, circular space station at the top right behind Finn and his lightsaber — could the First Order have a fully armed and operational third Death Star? And Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker is also noticeably missing from the poster, even though we heard his voice in the last Force Awakens teaser.
