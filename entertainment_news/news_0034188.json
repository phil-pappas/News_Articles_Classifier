PUBLISHED: 19:30, Fri, Oct 9, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:31, Fri, Oct 9, 2015 GETTY Charlize Theron goes from red carpet stunner to Mad Max warrior \nMad Max has often seemed to be all about the boys and their four-wheeled toys. \nWell, not any more. \nCharlize Theron exploded into the iconic film franchise in Fury Road and ripped out a new role for female characters front and centre of the action.

SG Rosie Huntington-Whiteley leads the wives of Immortan Joe \n\"They belong to a man who hurt her incredibly and she's just had enough and she's gonna take these women with her. \n\"She's gonna take what matters to him the most. \n\"It really is the ultimate story of revenge,\" Theron adds with a grin. \nMiller also loves the contrast between the softer and tougher sides of his heroine. SG Charlize Theron and director George Miller \n\"I thought it would be interesting to find someone who in another time would be regarded as a great beauty but in this post apocalyptic world has become a hard-bitten warrior,\" the director says. \n\"The paradox â€“ here is a very strong woman, statuesque more than just physically in her person and spirit and you recognise a vulnerability, its not just a mask. \nYou could almost be forgiven for thinking that this is not a film about Mad Max, himself, at all. \nNot that leading man Tom Hardy, has much to worry about after his star continues to rise with an electrifying turn as both Kray twins in Legend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:42:11.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
