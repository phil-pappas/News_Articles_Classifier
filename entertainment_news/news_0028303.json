But my eye is improving every day. It looks like it's a go for me. … This gives me a couple days to really work on it so I'm prepared for Tuesday.\"\nRose played aggressively and fearlessly in finishing with eight points, one assist and no turnovers in 10 minutes, 19 seconds. He attacked the rim and pushed the pace for coach Fred Hoiberg's offense, even after made Mavericks' baskets. He attempted just one 3-pointer, a missed three-quarters-court heave to beat the halftime buzzer.\nIn short, the masked version of Rose looked just as athletic and fast as the unmasked one.\n\"I felt good. I just wanted to get a feel for the offense,\" Rose said. \"I love the way Coach designed everything. He has me running downhill and catching the ball with a live dribble. There are a lot of lanes and so many opportunities to drive. It's open. I love it.\"\nDoug McDermott endured a wild night to sink the game-winning jumper with one second left. Drawing loud cheers throughout because he starred at nearby Creighton University, he missed his first seven shots before sinking a 3-pointer. He shot 2-for-10.\nAll the action from Lincoln, Neb.\n\"It's about time I made one,\" McDermott said.\nRose came off the bench to log two first-half stints and then sat out the second half. Hoiberg indicated both at the morning shootaround and pregame that Rose would play one stint each half and start the second half. The change came because Hoiberg wanted to keep him loose.\nRose's first stint produced his most impressive moments. He shredded the Mavericks' defense consistently, scoring on three drives to the rim. That included a three-point play chance off a nifty left-handed finish over a Zaza Pachulia foul, but he missed the free throw.\nHe knocked down his first jumper in his second stint, a mid-range shot from the wing. He later missed a forced jumper and then the halftime heave.\n\"Our pace was as good as it has been all preseason. And the other guys were running with him,\" Hoiberg said. \"That's what Derrick can do.\"\nRose said he took no blows to the face, though he endured two shots to his mask in Thursday's practice without incident.\n\"I'm just happy to be running around and get a groove for the game,\" Rose said.\nTaj Gibson, in an active 23 minutes, scored 16 points to lead the Bulls, who finished 4-4 in preseason play. And now Rose is back.\n\"I told him I don't care how you play,\" Hoiberg said. \"He obviously wants to play well. But the big thing is to get the process going in a game-type setting.\n\"I don't think people understand the work he put in in the offseason to get himself prepared for this year. … Everybody understands the importance of Derrick to this team.\"\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Derrick Rose Fred Hoiberg Chicago Bulls Doug McDermott Zaza Pachulia", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562afe49/turbine/ct-bulls-vs-mavericks-photos-spt-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562afc09/turbine/ct-derrick-rose-plays-bulls-spt-1024-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:28:01.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
