Its 4.5 wooded acres of an outdoor garden is a gem, a natural wonder, and the indoor gallery has always offered some of the finest art in Dallas.\nIts new show trumpets Italian Alex Corno, who’s staging his first U.S. solo exhibition, which consists of sculpture and works on paper. By his own description, Corno creates abstract forms using welded iron and stainless steel.\nWriting in the catalog for the exhibition, “Works: Milano-Dallas,” Luca Pagani poses the question: Why would a Texas gallery become so passionate about an Italian sculptor to the point of organizing a solo exhibition?\nThe answer is apparently found in the statement, “God is in the details.” As Pagani writes, “It’s in the details of his sculpture that we understand his uniqueness.” Corno’s show continues through Nov. 7.\nCraighead Green Gallery on Dragon Street has launched its own new exhibition, featuring yet another triple-header of artists: Joey Brock, Heather Gorham and Jay Maggio. Brock says he derives inspiration from “man-made landscapes of forgotten urban spaces.” Gorham is a self-taught artist who says she’s “inspired by the simple beauty of what exists right in front of me.” Maggio loves the “majestic live oaks and pecans” that dominate the landscape of Louisiana, where he lived for 30 years. This one is up through Nov. 15.\nThe Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist University has had quite a year. It welcomed two landmark exhibitions in honor of its 50th anniversary and the school’s centennial. The House of Alba show continues through Jan. 3.\nAnd now we have reached that time of year when the Meadows is accepting applications, through Nov. 11, for its Moss/Chumley North Texas Artist Award. It’s given annually “to an outstanding North Texas artist” who has shown professionally for at least a decade and who “has a proven track record as an active community advocate for the visual arts.” The cash prize is $2,500.\nThe competition is open to those who specialize in drawings, painting, sculpture, video, photography and performance, just to name a few of the categories.
