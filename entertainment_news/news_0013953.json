The amendment does provide a potential exemption for certain whales caught in the wild but it wasn't immediately clear whether that applied to any of the orcas at the San Diego park. \nIn a statement, SeaWorld said it was disappointed by the conditions attached to the approval of its \"Blue World\" expansion, set to open in 2018, which would triple the size of existing killer whale enclosures. \n\"Breeding is a natural, fundamental and important part of an animal's life and depriving a social animal of the right to reproduce is inhumane,\" the park said. \nThe panel's decision raised an array of questions, including whether the company would proceed with the project or raise a legal challenge, possibly on whether the commission overstepped its authority. SeaWorld said it was considering its options. \nThe vote followed a daylong hearing during which dozens of speakers argued for and against expansion. Although the permit involved a request to expand tank space, the discussion evolved into a wide-ranging debate over the conditions in captivity for the huge marine mammals, including breeding and the use of pharmaceuticals. \nThe commission that regulates land and water use along the California coast attached several conditions to the approval, including that no new whales from the wild will be kept there. SeaWorld says it hasn't captured wild orcas in more than 30 years. \nAttendance at the California park has declined since the release of the population documentary \"Blackfish\" in 2013, which suggests SeaWorld's treatment of captive orcas provokes violent behavior. The company's stock price also has dropped over the past two years. \nAt the meeting, SeaWorld veterinarian Hendrik Nollens disputed what he called \"outlandish accusations\" from critics of the park. The whales are enriched and stimulated, he said, not stressed or depressed. \n\"We care for these animals as if they were family,\" Nollens told the panel. \"We have nothing but the whales' best interest at heart.\" \nAnimal rights activists said the new tanks would only lead to more captivity for orcas. \nJohn Hargrove, a former SeaWorld trainer in California and Texas who has written a book about his experiences and appeared in the \"Blackfish\" film, said whales are heavily medicated and family structures that define life in the wild are broken. \nThe whales gnaw the edges of their pools, breaking or wearing teeth, and inbreeding has created \"hybrid orcas who have no true social identity,\" he said. \nAbout 500 people filled the meeting room to capacity, roughly divided between SeaWorld supporters wearing blue and white shirts and holding signs saying, \"Educate, Inspire, Conserve,\" and critics waving signs saying \"Vote no on SeaWorld Tanks\" and \"SeaWorld hurts Orcas.\" \nCoastal Commissioner Gregory Cox, who favored the expansion, said it would be a good thing to increase the size of the orcas' habitat. \nBut Commissioner Dayna Bochco, who brought up the no-breeding amendment, said she agreed with scientists who believe that the killer whales are suffering in captivity. \n\"They don't belong in captivity,\" she said. \nUnder the expansion, SeaWorld would demolish portions of a 1995 facility that included a 1.7-million gallon pool and replace it with a 5.2-million gallon tank and 450,000-gallon pool. \nThe Orlando, Florida-based company had said the orca population at the San Diego facility would not significantly increase due to the \"Blue World\" project.
