Ryan Kneller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Allentown's Canal Park showcases views that \"make you forget you're even in a city,\" the mayor says. \nWith the Waterfront development set to break ground this month, many people are getting excited for what's to come along the Lehigh River in Allentown. \nThe 26-acre area straddling the Tilghman Street bridge will be bustling with activity — from restaurants, retail shops and a riverwalk to apartments, office buildings and floating docks. \nThere also is the likelihood that open-air plazas and a sloped lawn area will bring concerts, festivals and a farmers market, says Zachary Jaindl, a principal in the proposed development. \nJaindl sees the $325 million project, scheduled to be complete in five to 10 years, as a way for Allentown to generate a sense of culture around the Lehigh River, \"an asset that defines the development and makes it unique.\" \nThe river runs about four miles through the city, from just south of the Route 22 bridge to the Rittersville section in east Allentown. \nWhile the city's waterfront attractions are sure to multiply, it's a good time to examine the recreational opportunities that already exist along the river. \nThe city's Waterfront development will spur use of the Lehigh River, but parks bordering its banks already offer recreation options. (APRIL BARTHOLOMEW / THE MORNING CALL ) \nThree city parks — Buck Boyle, Canal and Kimmet's Lock — now offer places to boat, fish, picnic and more. \nAllentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski has gone boating and water skiing on the river, but most frequently uses the parks for scenic walks. \n\"The Waterfront is going to dramatically change the area for the better, but there is already plenty to enjoy,\" Pawlowski says. \"As I said many times before, 'You can build a restaurant next to a drainage ditch, and people will sit outside and look at the drainage ditch.' We have real, live flowing water that you can kayak on, Jet Ski on and so forth. \n\"Unfortunately, the vast majority of people don't know about it because we have this old industry that's formed a barrier. So the development will certainly be transformational, just like it's been in other cities such as Philadelphia and Wilmington, because people love water.\" \nPawlowski envisioned the positive impact that the riverfront redevelopment would have on the city on first taking office in 2006. He credits its realization to the 127-acre Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ), where virtually all state tax dollars generated by new development can be used by property owners to pay off building loans. \n\"We have a hidden gem here,\" Pawlowski adds. \"Not only myself, but many mayors before me had this vision for the riverfront. It's beautiful. It's tranquil. And it's underutilized.\" \nTo better illustrate what Allentown has to offer along its shores, here is what I learned while touring the city's riverside parks with the mayor. \nBuck Boyle Park \nThis park, named after George \"Buck\" Boyle, a former pro baseball player from Allentown, was dedicated in 1973. \nIt is the most used of the three riverside parks — it has baseball and football fields, basketball courts, playgrounds, a pavilion and water park at 10 Pump Place. \nWater access is available, but is reserved for Lehigh University's men's and women's rowing teams. Their boathouse lies adjacent to the park's pavilion (which features 12 picnic tables and a grill). \nPeople celebrating a special occasion or just enjoying a casual meal under the pavilion can take in the river's sights — from fast-paced watercraft to picturesque boathouses on Adams Island. \nMany boaters hail from the private Frick Boat Club, Pawlowski says. About 100 yards south of the park, the club houses about 30 to 40 boats. \n\"What makes this part of the river unique is the Hamilton Street dam,\" he says. \"The dam actually creates a sort of inland lake that goes about a mile and half up to the Route 22 bridge. \n\"The water is anywhere from 5 to 12 feet deep, depending on the season and the amount of rain in that season, so you could take a fairly big boat and go all the way up to Route 22. After that, you start to hit more shallow water in Whitehall.\" \nOne of Buck Boyle's most popular attractions is its spray park, Pawlowski says. \nOpen noon to 7 p.m. (weather permitting) during the summer, it has a variety of fountains and city-themed structures — including \"cars\" and \"gas pumps\" that squirt water and a water tower that dumps water. \nOther park highlights include fields, used primarily by the Allentown A's youth baseball and football leagues, but also suitable for flying kites and taking leashed pets for walks; and playgrounds, designed for specific age groups and featuring more city-themed structures offering bouncing, climbing and sliding elements. \nA building housing Allentown's Weed & Seed Neighborhood Revitalization and Safety Program offers bathrooms and a water fountain. \nCanal Park \nCanal Park, dedicated in 1975 at East Walnut and South Albert streets, is Allentown's \"true hidden gem,\" Pawlowski says, showcasing views that \"mimic the Poconos and make you forget you're even in a city.\" \nIt is slightly secluded, accessible only by a long and winding portion of South Albert Street that runs parallel to the Lehigh Canal. \n\"It's kind of hard to get to, so I think a lot of people — I would venture to say over 90 percent of Lehigh Valley residents — don't even know it exists,\" Pawlowski says. \"It has a lot of potential, though, and we're looking at ways to activate it more. The problem is you have this active rail line that goes right through it.\" \nThe park's boat launch showcases breathtaking views of trees across the river. \nThe river is not as deep here as it is at Buck Boyle. Because of that, most people use the park's launch for canoes, Jet Skis and small fishing boats, Pawlowski says. \nA highlight of the park is access to the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, known as the D&L Trail. The trail, some of which is still under repair or development, will eventually run from the Seven Tubs area near Wilkes-Barre to Bristol, Bucks County. It follows a historic pathway that carried coal and iron from Wilkes-Barre to Philadelphia. \nThe next access point on the D&L Trail is 4.1 miles east at Bethlehem's Sand Island. Visitors can bike, hike or jog along the relatively smooth towpath. \nThe park also features a concrete dock for canal access, a pavilion with 12 picnic tables, restrooms, a water fountain and grill. \nBenches along the canal present an ideal place to relax and take in Mother Nature's splendor. \n\"This is probably the most beautiful part of the river in Allentown — the prettiest to photograph, for sure,\" Pawlowski says. \nKimmet's Lock \nKimmet's Lock, on the east side of the Lehigh River, is Allentown's official public boat launch, Pawlowski says, where people launch primarily large power boats because of the deep water. \nThe facility at North Dauphin Street and Allentown Drive is just north of the under-construction American Parkway Bridge, which is set to open next month after originally being proposed in the 1950s. The span will nearly directly link Route 22 and downtown Allentown, as well as open a path to the future Waterfront development. \nBecause of the bridge construction, a warning sign at the concrete launch ramp instructs individuals to use caution when boating in the area. \nThere isn't much else to see at the park besides an abundance of trees, a few trash cans and a parking lot. \nAcross the river from Kimmet's Lock, Allentown is considering establishing more park space with possibly another boat launch on city-owned land, Pawlowski says. \nDetails aren't available because the development hasn't been confirmed, but Pawlowski says the potential park could occupy some or all of the 20-acre property between the American Parkway Bridge and Whitehall Township border. \nPawlowski is hoping tubing companies, which have long been staples along the Delaware River, will set up shop along the Lehigh River. \nKimmet's also serves as a trailhead for the D&L Trail, but its section is closed because of the American Parkway Bridge construction project and resulting detours, according to the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:07:52.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
