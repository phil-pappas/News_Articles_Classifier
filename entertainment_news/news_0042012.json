When I heard my own quote I was like \"Jesus, Lena, no.\" I wasn't making a joke about domestic violence--I was over emphatic in my attempt to capture how damaging the Internet can be (not just to celebrities.) When I first discovered the world wide web as a teenager it felt like salvation. I've met a lot of my best friends there. It's allowed for so much magic. But it also makes room for so much hate and a new kind of violence. I'm not the first to say it. I shan't be the last. But I regret that earlier comparison because it doesn't accurately describe the condition of being attacked online AND it appears to make light of domestic violence, which ain't my style. Sleep tight and thank you for the @lennyletter love today. \nA photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Sep 29, 2015 at 9:33pm PDT \nCaitlyn Jenner avoids... Check out the new trailer...
