Comment Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 9:10 AM Updated Oct 1, 2015 at 12:31 PM By TV Guide Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 9:10 AM Updated Oct 1, 2015 at 12:31 PM Grab your Go-Go Juice - Honey Boo Boo just released a rap video. The 10-year-old star of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo has debuted a new song, \"Movin' Up,\" under her real name, Alana Thompson. The video features Thompson bopping around with her mother, \"Mama June\" Shannon , Shannon's on-again-off-again boyfriend Mike \"Sugar Bear\" Thompson, and Alana's 16-year-old sister Lauryn (aka Pumpkin). \"I'm just a small-town girl / Living in my princess world,\" Alana yells in the song's opening lines. The video is a sight to behold in itself, and the song is catchy, if nothing else. The clip was produced by viral video guru Adam Barta, who has previously collaborated with Margaret Cho , Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers, and \"Tan Mom\" Patricia Kentcil. Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was canceled last year after reports surfaced that Mama June was dating a convicted child molester. Check out the video below for a primer on how to do the \"Honey Boo Boo bop.\" Other Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:18:13.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
