They don't have a cocktail menu, so they'll whip up whatever you feel like, but bartender Josh Schaff created a special fall cocktail just for Birmingham Magazine. Ask for the Birmingham Buzz'd featuring tequila, lime, grapefruit, grenadine, and Strega.

Our favorite is the Normandy Kick with an apple brandy from Normandy, and Cardamaro, a digestif from Italy that adds the \"kick.\" Sample the other fall cocktail options, as well: Gentian and Ginger, Havana Crossroad, and the Andalusian.\nHighlands Bar and Grill | 2011 11th Ave S. | 205.939.1400 | highlandsbarandgrill.com\nEIGHT SWORD SWIZZLE FROM CARRIGAN'S This cocktail from Carrigan's is refreshing while tying in fall flavors. With a coconut-infused sake base, the tropical notes of the sake are combined with baking spices, heather, citrus, and honey. The cocktail is reminiscent of a warm fall day turning into a cooler evening. It's stirred with a swizzle stick until it's chilled enough to frost the glass.\nCarrigan's Public House | 2430 Morris Ave. | 205.440.2430 | carriganspub.com", "external_links": ["http://theredcatcoffeehouse.com/", "http://highlandsbarandgrill.com/", "http://www.ohenryscoffees.com/", "http://www.piperandleaf.com/", "http://thecollinsbar.com/", "https://flipburgerboutique.com/#/top", "https://www.facebook.com/carriganspub"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:12:10.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
