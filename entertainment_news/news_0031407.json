Photo: Paul Rovere \nThe Story of the Lost Child\nElena Ferrante​\nText Publishing, $37\nThe Story of the Lost Child by Elena Ferrante \nReview by Mark Tewfik\nAdvertisement The greatest thing about Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels so far has probably been the reviews. Each instalment now comes laden with pages of approving quotes from critics as estimable as James Woods in the New Yorker to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri; even Gwyneth Paltrow gets in on the action. \nSet largely against the backdrop of Naples, whose corruption and beauty are an integral part of the action, the quartet of novels begins in the late 1950s through to the early years of the new millennium, charting the lives of Elena and Lila, who were separated at a young age via education rather than geography. We see how the two women love, hate and use each other as their circumstances change over the years.\nFor those new to the books, the opening sentences of The Story of the Lost Child give a taste of what lies ahead: \"From October 1976 until 1979, when I returned to Naples to live, I avoided resuming a steady relationship with Lila. But it wasn't easy. She almost immediately tried to re-enter my life by force, and I ignored her, tolerated her, endured her.\" Ferrante's prose remains straightforward so she can better focus on the emotional lives of her characters. If you've read one, you'll almost certainly read all four.\nThis final novel takes the women into middle age and is one of the strongest books in the series. Elena eventually moves into the apartment directly above Lila's and by this stage Lila and her partner Enzo have set up their own company, which is doing well, and Elena's writing career continues to blossom. Both women become pregnant and give birth to daughters. The action is largely internal as Elena parses her own emotions and the events around her, which isn't to suggest that it's light on plot.\nThe flaws here are the same as in the other volumes. There isn't a development, surprise or revelation that isn't strongly telegraphed in advance. Lila's eyes still narrow at every instance and Elena can't help but accede to anything Nino asks. For all she experiences, and for all that close analysis, Elena never seems to learn from her mistakes. \nAlthough Elena and Lila are full of life and complexity, how much better would these books be if Ferrante had paid more than lip-service to the men? With the possible exception of Enzo, all of them are needy losers, whose recourse to action is either pleading, infidelity or violence. And if there's any chance a reader might miss what's going on, a heavy-handed symbol is never far away. In fact, what promises to be a really satisfying ending is marred by clumsy sentiment.\nBut this is not to detract too seriously from Ferrante's achievement; plot developments are hardly the stuff that makes these character-driven novels function. Underpinned by an unyielding honesty, the accumulation of insight and incident makes for intense and often painful reading. As Elena and Lila bring up daughters of the same age, we see many of their own traits appear in the girls. Bound by guilt, jealousy and a constant need for approval, each life is a cautionary tale or warped reflection of what the other could have been. \nFerrante understands that people are much more than a tally of their flaws and that, although not always good for us, some friendships are simply indispensable. Her Neapolitan novels contain real life – recognisable anxiety, joy, love and heartbreak. This is an incredibly difficult feat to achieve in the first place, let alone sustain, over four books. We will be talking about Elena and Lila for years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:58:54.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
