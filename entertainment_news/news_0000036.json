Ann Boult Walling (Photo: Tom Mason )\n15 CONNECT 41 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE NASHVILLE -- For Ann Walling, Mary and Carl Vance were as much a part of her family as her parents.\nBut her mom and dad didn’t see that. To them, the black servants in their Green Hills home were invisible.\nAnd Walling was too scared to say anything.\n“Being the coward I was, if I questioned them openly, I knew it would infuriate my parents, and I didn’t want to deal with that.”\nWalling, 75, touches on race relations in Nashville — and struggling with some of her parents’ thinking — in a new book, Sunday Dinner: Coming of Age in the Segregated South .\nWalling's dad was an intimidating figure. Reber F. Boult Sr. was a community leader, the “Boult” in Boult, Cummings, Conners & Berry law firm.\nBoult also was secretary of Vanderbilt University’s board and president of the Belle Meade Country Club, and a director or trustee for the chamber of commerce, the public library and almost any United Methodist Church board you can think of.\nWalling remembers there always being hired help in her parents’ and grandparents’ houses, black servants in starched white uniforms serving mounds of chicken, peas and buttery rolls at Sunday dinners.\nAnn Walling's parents, Olivia and Reber Boult, in 1992. (Photo: Submitted)\nShe wondered why they were only paid $30 a week. She wondered why they never used the front door.\nBut she kept quiet — even though she knew something wasn't right.\n“I thought, ‘Why do they have to do that? What difference does it make what door you come in?’ That always just bugged me a lot.”\nA few years later, in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka that ruled segregated schools unconstitutional.\nShe remembers bringing in the newspaper with a big headline, “Segregation out” — and Walling was thrilled.\n“My mother was in the kitchen and I saw her and said, ‘Look at this! I’m so glad they did this!’”\nHer mother’s face turned dark.\n“You wouldn’t say that if you knew what you were talking about,” she said tartly to her teen daughter.\n“That hit me really hard. It was like a massive moment of realization. All those things that had built up — going through the back door, separate drinking fountains, they call us mister and misses and we call them by their first names,” Walling said.\n“It was crystal clear to me — I did know what I was talking about.”\nMary and Carl Vance were hired shortly afterward. Carl Vance was quiet, stoic, but his wife?\nWalling fell in love with Mary Vance. The teen talked to Vance about boy problems, and the two spent hours in the kitchen baking together. Vance became a great friend to Walling during the girl’s adolescence.\nServants Mary and Carl Vance with children Robin Boult, left, and Mitch Boult in 1962. (Photo: Submitted)\nWalling's friends often would come to the house, say a quick hello to Walling’s mom and head straight to the kitchen to talk to Mary Vance.\nWalling went on to become an Episcopal priest, using her voice in a way she never did as a child. Walling advocated for the downtrodden and voiceless throughout her career, retiring from St. David’s in Belle Meade in 2010. Since then, she continues to fight for the less fortunate.\nWalling has been a leader for Insure Tennessee initiatives to provide health care insurance for the poor, and she also has battled sex trafficking overseas.\nShe just wishes she would’ve done more for the servants who were part of her childhood.\n“My biggest regrets with Mary and Carl and others in their situation would be that I didn’t step up and show them the respect and humanity that they deserved,” Walling said. “What I should’ve done first would’ve been to give them the dignity and respect they were due.”\n“They were not Mary and Carl, they were Mr. and Mrs. Vance. They could come in, in something other than servant’s clothes. They could’ve used the front door. Instead of living their lives as if they were invisible, they should’ve lived their lives as part of the family.”\n15 CONNECT 41 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1RDBq1j TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd1b26bfe74878a6aee34dfbfcb151d9a3b10dc1/c=0-288-3264-4640&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Nashville/Nashville/635800030782279856-Ann-Walling-headshot.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/Nashville/Nashville/635800030782279856-Ann-Walling-headshot.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RDBq1j&text=%27Sunday%20Dinner%27%20author%20shares%20deep%20regrets&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c23594e5e2bdb9b820e8a9667c942804009f7aa7/r=264x400/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Nashville/Nashville/635800030782279856-Ann-Walling-headshot.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1016d22de0e56b3e6568789f2784aae960f45e19/c=14-0-1985-1482&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Nashville/Nashville/635798852947830649-AnnWalling-03.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1RDBq1j", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RDBq1j&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/168b5b9b5c88a8f1cb10f37e89b14f15fbe373f2/c=98-0-1598-2000&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Nashville/Nashville/635798852903994368-AnnWalling-01.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:57:21.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
