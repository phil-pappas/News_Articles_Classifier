Comment Gonzales Weekly Citizen - Gonzales, LA By TV Guide Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 2:37 PM Updated at 4:32 PM Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 2:37 PM Updated at 4:32 PM Beauty and the Beast will end after its upcoming fourth season, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The CW gave the Kristin Kreuk and Jay Ryan drama an early Season 4 renewal months before its shortened third season premiered this summer. And though the series never garnered huge ratings, its most recent season only averaged 879,000 viewers, drastically down from its Season 1 average of 1.61 million. Beauty and the Beast 's final season is expected to premiere in 2016. Will you miss it? (Full Disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS, one of The CW's parent companies.)
