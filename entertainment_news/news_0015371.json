Ageism exists in all direction, but it isn’t the sweet spot for being taken seriously in the workplace. I’ve been really lucky. I got to do a lot of things before I was 30 that most people don’t.\" \nThat includes her successful HBO series, Girls , which she will wrap up next year, a best-selling memoir, Not That Kind of Girl, frequent essays in The New Yorker, and now a feminist e-letter Lenny, which has already made headlines with an essay by pal Jennifer Lawrence. \n\"I think women, when they're given an opportunity, are so afraid it's going to disappear,\" she said about her prodigious output. \"That was my 20s. I was like 'This may never strike again. I'm a kind of weird-looking girl, with a very specific voice, and the fact that I get to have a job is insane.'\" \nDunham said she takes her mission \"to spread positivity\" seriously. \n\"I know I’m not most moms’ idea of a role model, but I try to use the attention that comes with that wisely and not foolishly,\" she said. \"Yes, I will tweet about my issues with underpants, but I also want to say things that matter.\" \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
