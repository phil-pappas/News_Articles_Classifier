Oct 05, 2015 Photo by: Dagney C. Ernest Waldoboro’s historic Waldo Theatre has been closed since early last year, but hopes are it will have a full season in 2016. \nWaldoboro — The downtown Waldo Theatre is dark and has been for most of the past year and a half. It’s certainly not the first time the venerable venue has been out of commission in its 78-year history, which gives its board of directors hope that its fortunes can be turned once again. \n“When I first came here, in 1975, there was a chain across the door,” said board member Steve Cartwright at a public meeting held just after the rain let up Sept. 30 at the Town Office. \nThere is no chain barring entrance to the National Register of Historic Places building, but there is a list of required elements that must be checked off before the public can come in and give the board a hand. The small but engaged group of community members in attendance Sept. 30 served as testimony that the public is anxious to be part of the effort. \nThe board is a mix of new members — Oren Robinson had been voted on just a week earlier — and those who have been involved in running the Waldo over the past nine years. These include President/Secretary Chrys Hearth; recently nominated Treasurer Tabitha Ordway, absent this night; and members Brad Fillion, Corey Honkonen and Tod Widdecombe. Other new faces are music teacher Marlies Myers; promoter Melissa Smith, a marine scientist by day; and Bill Coombs. \nHearth opened the evening by having the attending board members identify themselves and saying that they were ready to “put the oars back in the water.” Water was an issue last winter, when a roof leak caused damage and subsequent mold growth. Widdecombe, a contractor by trade, has headed up repair efforts and said those problems had been dealt with. \n“And the finances are in pretty good shape, so we could open in October. But it makes more sense to open in the spring with a full slate,” said Hearth. \nHearth said the theater had experienced a real cash flow problem in recent years, but that this year’s fundraising efforts, including the ongoing Light up The Waldo Theatre campaign on gofundme.org, have brought in close to $10,000. That should cover electricity and insurance over the winter months, he said, and the group hoped to hold at least one fundraising event elsewhere, perhaps at Thomaston’s Watts Hall. \nIt’s a far cry from 10 years ago, when the Waldo was still owned by longtime patron Kitty Fassett and, according to Robinson, brought in about $102,000 and spent all but about $2,000 of it. Widdecombe estimated it would take about $35,000 a year to keep the building running as is. \nAs is, according to Hearth, the Waldo Theatre is insured and insulated and has a working, albeit very expensive to run, furnace; and Waldo Theatre Inc. is up-to-date in its nonprofit status. Both that status and insurance experienced unintended lapses in recent years, and it was clear during the meeting that both members of the community and some newer members of the board believe that much more transparency is required. \n“The board is attempting to bridge that gap. The community is passionate about that building,” said Robinson. \nRobinson — who, with Myers and Smith, is expected to help bring live music events back, to balance the Waldo’s theater programming — said he was the “chief agitator’ at the sometimes contentious meeting held in early April that led to the new board and fundraising effort. \n“I’m asking the community to keep on pushing, to get everybody to work together,” he said. \n“Really, the theater belongs to the people of this region,” said Cartwright. “If people know the board is going to be more visible, more open and more positive, then they will invest their help in making the theater more sustainable.” \nCommunity members Chris Davis and Janet McMahon, whose daughters were part of Waldo Theatre programs growing up, asked whether there was a strategic plan, and several board members said no, that is still in the future. Widdecombe said the ideal would be to have things like the furnace and other physical plant issues addressed in the next five to 10 years. All agreed that someone or a group of people skilled at launching and running a capital campaign is on the Waldo wish list. \nAttendees expressed a desire to be kept more up to date about where things stand. \n“There hasn’t been anything until recently; there was money there a few years ago, and people want to know why it’s closed,” said Barbara Boardman. “If it’s a conscious decision, we’ll be fine with this.” \nOne suggestion was that the Waldo join the Waldoboro Business Association, something Smith agreed with. \n“It is our intent to be a contributing economic entity in the community,” she said. \nThere was a back-and-forth discussion about the former practice of membership in the theater. Hearth cautioned that the organization’s 501(c)3 nonprofit status is specifically not membership-based, so some other model needs to be explored. He also expressed concern about asking WBA members and others for money when the theater is dark, saying “We want to earn our keep.” But Davis offered an alternative way to look at the current situation. \n“Think of it as a way to invest in the community,” he said. \nNewcomer Myers said she was doing a lot of listening, to both the board and the community, in these early days. \n“We’re still growing as a group together, figuring out how do we move forward,” she said. \nThe Waldo’s popular children’s programming, and the Midcoast theater community at large, sustained a big blow when longtime children’s theater director Susan Ghoreyeb died last fall. Although offering a variety of entertainment and workshop options is envisioned, Hearth said education and youth programming at the theater is a critical part of its future. \nWiddecombe said he spends most Saturdays working on the building and will welcome community hands to that task, once the board can allow local folks into the building again — something Hearth said is right around the corner. \n“I almost wish we could have held this meeting in two weeks, at the theater,” he said. “We’re so close.” \nWiddecombe added that most of the issues he is dealing with now are surface issues. \n“The goal is for the Waldo to be the clean, unique, historic and beautiful building it is,” he said. \nFor updates on the Waldo Theatre, and a list of building material donations sought, visit thewaldo.org where, Hearth said, email links to board members will be available soon.
