Photo: Ten \nBut in an interview with The Daily Telegraph , the fun-loving carpenter revealed he left the mansion twice during filming to attend the funerals of two close friends.\nAdvertisement According to the report, Lloyd decided not to tell Frost about losing his two mates in the space of just one week to spare her feelings.\nOne funeral was for 23-year-old Lachie Thomson, who was killed in a freak accident after falling from a cliff in Sydney's Freshwater.\nDavey trying to convince Sam he has a serious side. Photo: Ten \n\"It was a selfless act. I didn't want to make her feel guilty. Lachie Thomson, he was a friend. I'd known him for a while,\" Lloyd said.\n\"I left the house to go to the funerals. I chose to stay because I wanted to show I was serious but I didn't want to tell her what was going on.\n\"I only found out because I called my mum.\n\n\"I found out four days after one had passed away, and then the next one was a few days after that.\"\nDavey began the show well with a carnival win. \nLloyd said he he was upset by the way he had been portrayed as \"an immature brat\" on the show, calling it a \"joke\".\nHe also said the comments made about him online were starting to affect him.\n\"It was a weird ending - they're not going to show it.\"\nDavey interrupts alone time between Tony and Sam. \n\"There's so much negativity. I can get battered down, but how much can I be humble?\"\n\"Nobody understands what it's like unless you're in there,\" he said.\nThe NSW resident was sent home in the middle of a cocktail party by Frost without a chance to say goodbye to any of the other contestants in the house.\nThe Bachelorette blokes have remained close since filming wrapped several months ago, with Lloyd frequently appearing in pictures with David Billsborrow and Sasha Mielczarek.\n  The 3 amigos @davey_lloyd @sash1313 \nA photo posted by David Billsborrow (@billsborrow) on Sep 30, 2015 at 9:57pm PDT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:47:15.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
