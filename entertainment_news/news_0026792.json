Preliminary indications are that drug use factored into Cerveny's death, sources said.\nThe 38-year-0ld mother of three went out with friends Saturday night, but at some point met up with a man, and left with him. They went to go see another person who lives in the building where Cerveny was found, according to police.\nPolice said surveillance video caught both men carrying Cerveny's body to the building's front door. One of the men called 911, but both left before police arrived.\nCharges are unlikely in the case, police said.", "external_links": ["http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/05/kiersten-cerveny-li-dermatologist-dead-chelsea/"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:16:43.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
