Jeff and I actually never have done a full tour. \"I was always on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I was always either making a movie, so we've never actually done a full tour. So I'm looking this summer to be the first time that we go out on a full world tour.\"The star, whose last music release came in 2005 with the album Lost and Found, revealed that he's already got about 30 new songs recorded, but there are \"six or seven that I really, really like, that I'm trying to get the ideas to come out right\". © Barry King/FilmMagic Whatever happened to the original Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast? \"I have so many things that I want to say and I'm struggling with saying them in a way that fit the flavour of music that I tend to like,\" he added, making it known that he's in the studio almost every day with various collaborators.Before Smith's solo projects (and movie career), he and long-time collaborator DJ Jazzy Jeff released five albums from 1987-1993. Their biggest hit together was probably 'Summertime', which won a Grammy award.Watch Will Smith reveal all to Zane Lowe below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:28:18.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
