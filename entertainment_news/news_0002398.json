Jeb Bush appeared on the first episode of \"Late Show,\" while Bernie Sanders visited during the show's second week and Michelle Obama has also appeared. Variety TV columnist Brian Lowry called Colbert's interview with Donald Trump a good example of a \"funny, not fawning interview.\"\nClinton has already made a visit to \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and cameoed on \"Saturday Night Live\" this campaign season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:30:48.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
