But the effects, costumes, sets, steampunk touches and gory Grand Guignol zest are more than enough to make it worth your while.\nThe film tells the turn-of-the-century story of young, aspiring Buffalo, N.Y., writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska, the picture of a Gothic heroine). After Edith, who had a flirtation going with young Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), is swept up by the dashing English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (a vampirish Tom Hiddleston), she moves with him to Allerdale Hall in the north of England, his ancestral home.\nThe place, which is sinking, looks like a Gothic monument carved by the feverish imagination of del Toro and, in addition to its picturesque attributes, including moths, it’s missing a roof, and dead leaves flutter down its gaping hole, along with the wind and rain. Although he has not replaced his damaged roof, Sharpe has built a machine to mine the valuable crimson clay from the hill upon which the hall sits. He’s also plainly undermining his own dwelling.\nSharpe has lived in the hall his whole life with his oddly emphatic sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain, whose face and mossy, iridescent dresses make you want to gush, “Nevermore”). Lucille is un­married and still lives there. Edith, who has seen ghosts since she was 10 years old — when she was visited by the ebony specter of her late mother, who died of “black cholera” — is immediately harried by horrific apparitions in the hall, one of which rises from the basement where she has been forbidden to go.\nThe screenplay by del Toro and frequent writing partner Matthew Robbins spends too much time in America and is a mashup of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rebecca” and “Suspicion,” along with Edgar Allan Poe’s classic 1839 tale “The Fall of the House of Usher,” with Sharpe as Roderick Usher and Lucille as his weird sister Madeline. I am afraid these allusive “bones” stand out too sharply to take much of the plot seriously.\nBut the wraiths, which ooze smoky ectoplasm, have the ghastly beauty of classic Japanese ghost paintings, and I could not take my eyes off of Wasikowska in her diaphanous nightgown with her blond hair hanging down her shoulders, knife in hand. She is an ivory and gold Pre-Raphaelite angel of death. The costumes in “Crimson Peak” rival those of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula,” which was a landmark in terms of horror-movie wardrobe and production values. Like that “Dracula,” “Crimson Peak” is sure to become a film you will want to see over and over again.\n(“Crimson Peak” contains sexually suggestive scenes, extreme violence and gruesome images.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:53:27.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
