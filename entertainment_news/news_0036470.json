The Australian singer/songwriter dropped on Tuesday, October 20 the clip which centers on a group of people wearing her signature bob wig. Covering their black-and-white wigs with dark-colored hoodies, they run around the town and spray-paint the song's lyrics across the walls and sidewalks. They accompany the words with images of some faces, Xanax pills and a barking dog among others. Written by Sia along with Adele and Tobias Jesso Jr., \"Alive\" was originally meant for the British singer's new album. \"It's about Adele's life, so I now sing a song from Adele's perspective,\" Sia has said of the track. After Adele turned down the song, Sia made it hers and will feature it on her own upcoming album \" This Is Acting \". Marking her first full-length since last year's \" 1000 Forms of Fear \" which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard 200, the new set is scheduled to come out later this year via Monkey Puzzle Records/RCA Records. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:39:04.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
