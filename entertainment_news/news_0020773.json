Former head coach, Joe Philbin was fired after starting the season with a 1-3 record. Campbell is a former NFL tight end who was the tight ends coach for the Dolphins. He has a fiery personality and a tough no nonsense type of guy.\nIn his first game as the head coach he helped lead Miami to a 38-10 road victory over the Tennessee Titans. His passion and intensity seemed to rub off on the entire team. The offense played with more physicality and stayed committed to running the ball and putting the quarterback in favorable down and distance situations in the passing game. The defense played fast and attacked the Titans offense. All-Pro defensive end Cameron Wake had 4 sacks and helped keep Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota contained for most of the game.\nMiami should stick with this philosophy of committing to the running game and look for opportunities to make big plays deep with the passing game when available. While the defense should continue to attack instead of reading and reacting to the offense. It has only been one game with the new head coach, but at least they have showed a new excitement and some passion to play better. Campbell's personality may be just what Miami has been needing.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/422972/cameron-wake"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:49:41.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
