Learning Chinese Characters [photograph] retrieved from: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/learning-chinese-characters.jpg This is the final article in the series explaining Claire Colebook's look at the linguistic turn. The differential and arbitrary nature of signs, according to post-structuralists, was problematic for phenomenologists such as Husserl, who were interested in transcendental subjectivity. While Husserl saw lived experience as primordial, Derrida saw \"differance\" as the ground of this lived experience. He thus established what he believed was something more fundamental than the transcendental subjectivity of the lived present. Like Heidegger before him, Derrida focused on the inherently referential, other-oriented nature of the lived present. The present always refers to a past and a future in which it is sandwiched. It never functions as a kind of pure present. Consciousness is therefore a manifold. Consciousness is also other-oriented insofar as it refers to that which is other than itself. Thus, for Derrida, consciousness functions, not as a present, but as something inherently bound up with difference. Since it is the principle of \"presence\" which allowed Husserl to postulate transcendental subjectivity as a ground for further philosophizing, Derrida's rejection of the coherence of a pure, undifferentiated, non-referential presence was incoherent. Derrida saw subjectivity as what he referred to as \"quasi-transcendental.\" The quasi-transcendental does not \"posit an explanatory condition before experience - either language or the subject - and this is because Derrida deconstructs the opposition between the self-present subject, on the one hand, and the system of writing, on the other.\"\n\"So, for example, to experience any present event as, say, an experience of redness, I already have to mark out what in this general could be repeated, or what in this experience is lived as this or that quality. The present or now is never pure but requires a trace, or a marking out of some aspect that could be carried over from the past to the future. In this respect, even before we have al language strictly speaking, even before there are the actual signs of a natural language or cultural convention, consciousness or experience is already differential. That is, for consciousness to be consciousness of what is not itself, it must experience otherness (tor transcendence) as having an identifiable, repeatable, or what Derrida will call \"iterable\" character: something in the experience that is anticipated as continuing beyond the self-present. This means that the phenomenological commitment to genesis, or tracing all signs back to a founding and self-present conscious act, is impossible. For that every phenomenon of self-presence, or the consciousness that lives the world as meaningful, requires a marking out of time: a tracing or inscription in which the \"lived\" is never fully self-present.\"\nDerrida did not intend structure, or the system of signs, to replace genesis, or the founding act of consciousness as a transcendental grounding. Indeed, it is clear that he rejected the notion of a pure, present transcendental ground of anything. Subjectivity could not grant the transcendental, and structure certainly could not. To be sure, Derrida agreed with the phenomenological notion that consciousness is always object-oriented. But he did not believe it grounds anything. Experience is instead always inherently differential by referring beyond itself, and this is also the case with language, which also inhabits the human individual even while referring beyond itself.\nOther post-structuralists took their cue from Derrida. Irigaray, for example, argued that Western metaphysics is preoccupied with pure presence. According to this position, \"the self occurs only as a medium or occasion for thought to master its own process of representation.\" This narcissistic mode of subjectivity has no room, she argues for another being which can itself never be fully mastered by thought. Such a self would refer beyond itself to other selves. There \"would no longer be \"a\" language or formal system, whose single origin \"we\" might discover through processes of retrieval and interpretation. Instead, w would acknowledge the textual \"scene\" in which different voices and styles of speech and writing create distinct positions in relation to each other.\"\nFoucault is one of the most important figures in the structuralist and post-structuralist movement. He made the intriguing point that \"phenomenology's attention to the founding acts of consciousness and structuralism's insistence on the linguistic mediation of all life both assumed \"man\" as an \"empirico-transcendental double.\" That is, man was at once the effect of conditions within the world, for we become human and cultural through language and its historical developments, while at the same time, man was the being who could recognize himself as empirically conditioned.\" Foucault's project was in some respect similar to that of the later Wittgenstein, insofar as he was concerned, not with language as something which dispassionately represents or labels objects, but as the medium through which particular discourses or worldviews are constructed and transmitted.\nMany philosophers have begun to depart from the linguistic turn. A contemporary of the aforementioned post-structuralists, Gilles Deleuze, was a realist, as opposed to the tendency of those of the linguistic turns to argue for a kind of linguistic idealism, and he was a materialist, in contrast to the tendency of those of the linguistic turn to reject metaphysical speculation. Cognitive scientists have likewise attempted to integrate phenomenologists such as Husserl and Heidegger in an attempt to focus on humans as beings in the world rather than as abstract, purely formal, processing machines. Some of these cognitive scientists are particularly interested in the notion of an embodied cognition.\nGilles Deleuze and his long-time writing partner, are of particular interest, since they were contemporaries of the intellectuals associated with the linguistic turn. He stands out as a sore thumb in relation to them, as a realist and a materialist. Like Derrida, Deleuze published early work on Husserl. Like both post-structuralists and phenomenologists, Deleuze was interested in genesis. However, he was not interested solely in the question of the genesis of discourse. He was interested in the generation of systems in general. This extended, not only beyond language, but even to non-human life-forms. Reality does not consist, for humans, merely of discourse in language. Instead, concrete physical, moral, legal, biological, etc. artifacts all go into constituting human reality and all need to be taken account of in any intellectual analysis. This is a metaphysics of \"stratification.\" It is a metaphysics that goes beyond mere signifiers. He rejected the idea, however, that only signifiers, or linguistic tokens, counted as signs. Pre-linguistic and non-linguistic categories can function as signs too:\n\"...for example see the affective signs of the body - blushing, grimacing, frowning, smiling - as expressions of the body's visceral system. We could in turn see that visceral system as an expression or sign o the body's genetic-biological tendencies. In any network of relations, one side of the stratification is expressive, not simply remaining within itself but presenting a gesture, sign, or surface that can enter into a relation with another system. for example, a body's metabolic relations can express themselves in feelings, which can then be (in turn) expressed as bodily movements. The other side of the strata faces the organized or formed matters, which can also enter into relations with other systems, for example, if my bodily affective system encounters a virus, or a neurological disorder, then the form of content (a body's response system) might yield a new form of expression (a body that could no longer speak would require some new system of expression). Thus Deleuze and Guattari's theory of stratification allows us to see language as one regime of signs among others, and as being the expression of other relations and systems.\"", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida", "http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/learning-chinese-characters.jpg", "http://www.academia.edu/1186021/Linguistic_Turn"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:42:13.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
