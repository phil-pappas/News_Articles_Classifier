Getty Images Travel Deals Filed Under: Celebrities & Gossip \nPop star Taylor Swift is planning to take a long break from music once her 1989 tour comes to an end. \nThe Shake It Off singer is set to conclude the shows in Melbourne, Australia in December after seven months on the road and she has now decided to take a hiatus once the tour ends so she can focus on spending time with her loved ones. \nTaylor also admits she fears her fans may get bored of her unless she steps away from the spotlight for a while. \"I think I should take some time off,\" she tells Britain's NME magazine. \"People might need a break from me. I'm going to hang out with friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know.\" During the interview, Taylor also reveals she struggles with doubts about her hugely successful career, and relies on her mother for advice. \"If you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up, then you'll be done,\" she adds. \"A lot of the time I call my mom and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and that matter.\" \nIt has been a huge year for Taylor so far both personally and professionally - as well as her big-selling tour, she also went public with her romance with Calvin Harris and was credited with changing the music industry by forcing Apple bosses to backtrack on a payment policy for artists signed up to their Apple Music streaming service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:57:42.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
