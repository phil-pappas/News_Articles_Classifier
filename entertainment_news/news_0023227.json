Ainsley Harriott and Natalie Lowe (Guy Levy/BBC) \n“I’m not being funny, I’m not being grand. I think we celebrities, or as I prefer to call us ‘trainee dancers’, are in a bubble a bit. I live with my daughter and she said to me: ‘You’re popular on social media, Dad. Well done’.” \nThe 58-year-old first found fame in 2000 when he presented BBC Two cooking series Ready Steady Cook and coined the catchphrases “Percy Pepper and Susie Salt”. \nPartnered with Natalie Lowe for Strictly, Ainsley performed a tango to Abba’s Voulez Vous in week one and a salsa to Josephine Baker’s Don’t Touch My Tomatoes in week two. Ainsley and Natalie Lowe (BBC) \nHe will spread more happiness as a dancing penguin in this third week of Strictly, which has a movie theme. The TV star will cha cha cha to Earth, Wind & Fire’s Boogie Wonderland taken from animation favourite, Happy Feet. \nThe pressure is on as his routines have so far been enthusiastically received by the public and the genial Londoner is a firm favourite on Twitter. Promoted stories \nUsers have posted tweets praising his larger-than-life personality: @StrictlyAinsley @RealNatalieLowe penguin themed chacha will suit Ainsley's personality . a winner for me can't wait to see it #Strictly \n— BETTY REDONDO (@bettyredondo) October 9, 2015 i am so excited to see ainsley dress up as a penguin on saturday #Strictly", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:45:31.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
