Hallum was called to set up a mosquito trap, but also looked for areas that could breed mosquitoes. STAN LIM, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » Yellow fever mosquitoes capable of carrying dengue fever and other viral diseases have been found in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\nThe tropical, non-native Aedes aegypti was identified in Riverside on Friday, Oct. 2, at a time with many mosquito-transmitted West Nile Virus cases in both counties. Hundreds of the mosquitoes were found in San Bernardino County for the first time about a week earlier.\nAedes aegypti can transmit possibly fatal dengue and yellow fevers, as well as chikungunya virus, to people. Severe dengue, which has no vaccine, can cause breathing problems and circulatory system failure. Yellow fever, for which there is a vaccine, can lead to jaundice and organ failure.\nThe aggressive, day-feeding mosquito is clearly distinguishable from the little brown mosquitoes native to the area.\nThe black mosquito with a 2.7 mm average wingspan has striking white spots on its abdomen, white bands on its legs and white lines on its thorax, or mid-section between its head and abdomen, that resemble a lyre.\nDengue fever is endemic in northern Mexico, Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control District Vector Ecologist Michelle Brown said Wednesday.\n“There are lots of people who travel back and forth to Mexico. So there’s a real concern about dengue being locally acquired,” she said.\nOFFICIALS CONCERNED\nThe find marks the first time these mosquitoes have been found in the county, said Riverside County Department of Environmental Health Program Chief Dottie Merki, who works in vector control.\nNo cases of dengue or chikungunya acquired in California have been reported, and the risk of those being transmitted in the region is low, according to Merki and a California Department of Public Health document. State public health department officials did not respond to a request for information.\nYet people who travel to or from other countries could bring the viruses here, where the diseases can now be spread by mosquitoes able to transmit them when native mosquitoes can’t, Merki added.\n“We’re always concerned when a species that’s not endemic to the area shows up that can transmit a disease that is also not endemic to the area,” she said.\nAedes aegypti was found in California in 2013.\nMosquito abatement officials describe the insect as “elegant” and “beautiful.” A San Bernardino County vector control technician was so taken with them she had one tattooed larger-than-life on her shoulder.\nHowever, abatement personnel take the tiny blood suckers very seriously.\nThree were identified by sight Friday by Brown’s staff. They notified state health officials that day.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2b-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2a-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2c-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2c-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jp.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2c-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2b-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jl.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt29-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2b-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2a-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jh.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2c-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jp.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2a-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jd.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2d-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3iv.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2a-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jh.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2e-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3j4.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2e-b88534101z.120151007201348000guecf7la.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2e-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3j4.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2a-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jd.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2d-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3j1.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2a-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2d-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3j1.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2e-b88534101z.120151007201348000guecf7la.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvt2b-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jl.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt2d-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3iv.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvt29-b88534101z.120151007201348000gtmcf3jb.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:09:42.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
