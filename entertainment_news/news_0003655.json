The special will keep the honoree center stage throughout the night by integrating tribute performances of Sinatra classics with rare archival footage narrated by Sinatra himself. “Frank Sinatra is a voice for all generations. His showmanship and artistry have remained unmatched since he began performing professionally in the 1930s to his last recording 21 years ago,” said Neil Portnow, President/CEO of The Recording Academy. “Today, he continues to gain popularity for his classic sound and signature style. It’s only fitting that we join the global celebration in honor of his 100th birthday.” “My personal memories of Frank remind me that he was a class act who also knew how to have fun. That's what this celebration will be,” said Executive Producer Ken Ehrlich of AEG Ehrlich Ventures. “By partnering with Steve Wynn and featuring Las Vegas as the backdrop, the evening will be a party the Rat Pack would be proud of.” “The name Frank Sinatra is synonymous with excellence that is timeless. As a performer, he possessed undeniable charisma and masterful artistry that resonate throughout generations,” said Jack Sussman, Executive Vice President, Specials, Music and Live Events, CBS Entertainment. “To have the opportunity to celebrate the life and art of The Chairman of the Board on his 100 th birthday, and witness the lasting effects his music has had on artists today with a star-studded GRAMMY concert, is a true honor.” Among Sinatra's nine GRAMMY Award wins are three for Album Of The Year for Come Dance With Me (1959), September Of My Years (1965), and A Man And His Music (1966).
