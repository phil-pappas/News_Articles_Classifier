California Rep. Kevin McCarthy shocked fellow Republicans Thursday when he abruptly dropped his bid for speaker. McCarthy, the majority leader, had hoped to replace Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who plans to step down at the end of the month.\nRepublicans are trying to persuade Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee and a former GOP vice presidential nominee, to run for speaker. Ryan has said he isn't interested in the job. Republican Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Daniel Webster of Florida are competing for the post. The leadership battle has thrown the party into chaos.\nThe 2016 presidential election will also be a topic on the shows. Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who are leading in the polls, will be guests. Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is also running for president, but trailing far behind them in the polls, will also appear.\nHere are some of the guests in the lineup:\n• CBS’ Face the Nation : Trump, Carson, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C.\n• NBC’s Meet the Press : Republican Reps. Dave Brat of Virginia and Charles Dent of Pennsylvania on the GOP leadership race.\n• CNN’s State of the Union : Martin O’Malley, former governor of Maryland and Democratic presidential candidate.\n• Fox News Sunday : Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Rep.
