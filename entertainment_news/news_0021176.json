Appearing on Tuesday's Good Morning America , the actor said he doesn't have \"any big plan\" to fix the issue, but he did detail how the gender pay disparity might be eliminated in Tinseltown. \n\"I just thought that the idea of transparency is something that obviously would be beneficial,\" Cooper said. \"It's something you never talk about. You never hear about what somebody else is making when you're doing a movie.\" \nCooper admitted that the topic of money might be difficult to discuss, but added, \"maybe it shouldn't be.,\" \"Today, it's so hard to get movies made and you definitely are having conversations with your agent about, 'Take a cut or do this or put money over here,'\" he continued. \"So why not say, 'Okay, well, what's everybody making? Let's make sure it's as equal as we can make it.'\" \nThe issue is important to Cooper, whose co-stars are frequently women. In his latest film, Burnt , Cooper reunites with his American Sniper co-star, Sienna Miller. \n\"I've been very lucky in the sense that I've been able to act with people, specifically actresses, again and again,\" he said on GMA . \nCooper said while filming American Sniper with Miller, he thought she'd be great to play opposite him as a top chef in Burnt . \"So I just thought she would've been incredible, and she was,\" he added. \nFor Cooper's role, he portrays a burned-out diva chef, trying to survive the pressures of working in a top-rated \"three-Michelin Star level\" restaurant. \"I mean, it's like playing in the World Series or something,\" he said of cooking professionally at that level. \nBurnt , also starring Uma Thurman and Matthew Rhys, is out Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:36:12.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
