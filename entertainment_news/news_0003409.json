Sotheby's says it was revealed during a 2000 conservation. An inscription indicates it was intended as a gift to Manach.\nThe seller is billionaire businessman William Koch (kohk), who displayed it so it could be seen from both sides.\nHe's also selling a 1908 \"Water Lilies\" painting by Claude Monet. It's estimated at $30 million to $50 million.\nThe sale is Nov. 5.\nKoch is a 1992 America's Cup winner and brother of conservative donors Charles and David Koch.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the correct title of the work is \"Water Lilies,\" not \"Water Lily.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
