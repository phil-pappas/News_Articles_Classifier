This fall, students will attend Broadway musicals ( On Your Feet! , Finding Neverland , School of Rock and The Phantom of the Opera ) and engage in supporting curriculum to immerse themselves in the remarkable stories told on these stages.\n\"Living in the cultural capital of the world, access to enriching arts and cultural experiences should be a given for all New York City public school students – unfortunately, this is not the case,\" said Damian Bazadona , Founder of The Situation Project. \"With the help of some very passionate supporters, we are at the beginning of an exciting groundswell of support in using the power of live, cultural experiences to enrich our communities – particularly those not currently served with the access and resources they deserve. Our local, public schools are the incubators of tomorrow's leaders; so we simply see this as an investment in our own community.\"\nWith the support of leaders in the NYC arts and culture community, including Situation Interactive, Jujamcyn Theaters, and The Nederlander Organization, in addition to other producers, creatives, entrepreneurs and members of the local community, The Situation Project has pledged funds to provide five years of experiences to ensure each student feels the lasting benefit from ongoing exposure to the arts.\n\"Broadway is home to so many amazing stories and remarkable talent,\" said Micah Hollingworth , VP of Operations at Jujamcyn Theaters, a founding supporter of The Situation Project. \"Creating an environment where the students can see themselves in the talent both onstage and backstage is enriching on so many levels for the students and the faculty.\"\nFounded in 2011, The Situation Project has provided cultural experiences to date for over 5,000 New York City students, including The Phantom of the Opera , Les Miserables , Wicked , Mary Poppins , Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark , Honeymoon in Vegas , Mamma Mia!, War Horse , and The 39 Steps among many others.\n\"Our mission is clear – invest in those schools that are doing the most with the least. As an investment, it's financially prudent, morally right and within our means collectively to see true results of this effort,\" added Bazadona.\nAbout The Situation Project: Founded in 2011, The Situation Project has provided cultural experiences for over 5,000 NYC students.
