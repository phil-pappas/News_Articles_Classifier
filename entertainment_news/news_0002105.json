The back nine puts the CBS drama at a 22-episode order for its freshman season.\nAdditionally, CBS has ordered six more scripts for medical drama \"Code Black,\" signaling faith in the series.\n\"Limitless,\" starring Jake McDorman and Jennifer Carpenter, has been one of the most promising rookie performers this fall, consistently retaining most of its young-adult lead-in from \"NCIS: New Orleans\" on Tuesdays. Through five weeks, the action drama has averaged a 1.7 rating in adults 18-49 and 9 million total viewers in same-day viewing, rising in Live+3 on average by about 0.9 in 18-49 and by about 3 million total viewers.\n\"Code Black,\" anchored by Marcia Gay Harden, has averaged a 1.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 7.4 million viewers overall in same-night averages through its first four weeks, and it has grown on average by about 0.6 in 18-49 and 2.4 million viewers in \"live plus-3\" estimates. Though it's down from last season's \"Stalker\" in the timeslot, CBS has to like the show's consistency in recent weeks, as it has done the same 1.2 same-day young-adult rating with each of its last three episodes.\n\"We're excited how 'Limitless' continues to evolve creatively each week and stand out with its unique style of storytelling,\" said Glenn Geller, president of CBS Entertainment. \"It's off to a strong start in a highly competitive environment.\"\nBradley Cooper Returning to CBS' 'Limitless'\nExec producers on \"Limitless\" are Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Craig Sweeny, Todd Phillips, Heather Kadin, Ryan Kavanaugh, Tucker Tooley, Tom Forman, Marc Webb, original film director Neil Berger and Bradley Cooper will reprise his guest role on next week's episode.\n\"Code Black\" premiered later than \"Limitless\" in the second week of the season so insiders say the network is still waiting to view additional multi-platform data, before handing over the full-season order.\nAlso still up in the air at CBS is comedy \"Life In Pieces,\" though a full-season decision likely won't come until the sitcom moves into its regular Thursday night slot, following \"Thursday Night Football\" wrapping on Oct. 29. On Thursdays, the new family ensembler will be paired with the network's comedy-heavy night, anchored by \"The Big Bang Theory.\"\nOther new dramas that have received full-season orders are NBC's \"Blindspot,\" ABC's \"Quantico\" and Fox's \"Rosewood.\" The first comedy to land its back episode order is ABC's \"Dr. Ken.\"\nThe hotly-anticipated \"Supergirl\" premieres this Monday Oct. 26 on CBS.\nRick Kissell contributed to this report.\nMore coverage Vice plans to launch TV channels in U.S., Europe", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAZpdTR1mTY"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:36:30.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
