Apple Pay is available on the iPhone 6 models and the company’s recently-launched Watch. You’ll soon be able to pay for a pumpkin spice latté at Starbucks with just a tap of an iPhone.\nThat goes for a bucket of KFC chicken or a bacon burger platter at Chili’s, too.\nThe restaurant chains are among the latest to begin accepting Apple’s mobile wallet Pay system, an Apple exec told a California tech conference on Thursday.\nApple Pay, available on the iPhone 6 models and the company’s recently-launched Watch, is coming to select Starbucks locations by the end of the year in a pilot program before rolling out to about 7,500 U.S. stores next year, said the Seattle-based coffee company. It already has Pay in place in the U.K.\nChili’s parent Brinker International said it will have the system in 930 of its restaurants next year, while Yum! Brands will introduce Pay in the spring.\nLaunched a year ago, Apple’s digital wallet lets consumers pay for items at the point of sale by holding an iPhone or Watch near a credit or debit card reader.\nThe service has yet to catch on in a big way, though, only accounting for about 1% of all U.S. retail transactions, according to research firm Aite Group.\nApple, which counts such major retailers as Best Buy and Target as pay partners, expects to be in 1.5 million chains by the end of the year.\nStarbucks already has its own app that lets users pay for its goods with a mobile device and earn rewards.\nRelated Stories How to turn off Apple Music's auto-renewal subscription iPhone 6s brings crowds to NYC Apple Store", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:43:42.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
