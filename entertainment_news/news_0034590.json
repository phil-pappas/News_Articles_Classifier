Admittedly, the prospect of matching up to Tiger Shroff is what motivated Sudheer to push himself harder.\n\"The film is loaded with gravity- defying action sequences and I worked that much harder on my fitness to be on par with Tiger, who is extremely supple and agile. I underwent training in various forms of martial arts including Kalaripayattu,\" recalls Sudheer Babu, who seems to be least perturbed about playing the villain in what will be his first Bollywood outing.\nSudheer would prefer to be known as a performer more than a hero. \"As an actor, I should be able to play any kind of role with ease. I'd rather be recognised as an actor than a protagonist or antagonist because that doesn't really matter. That is why I took up the role because it was not just challenging but also a way of expanding my horizons. It's not a small film and I get to work in a different kind of work atmosphere. I am cherishing all that,\" he enthuses. Having shot only for Telugu films so far, the experience of shooting in a Hindi film was both new, yet familiar for the actor. \"The preparation for the roles is similar because depending on the role, one works on the body language and style, irrespective of the language. What I found new was the experience of shooting in Hindi. I know the language really well and have no problem conversing in it. Yet, the experience does seem different because I am so used to working atmosphere where Telugu is being spoken all around,\" says Sudheer signing off.
