The cast of American Hustle (Evan Agostini/AP) \nBradley was taken aback, and told Reuters he would begin teaming up with female co-stars to negotiate fair salaries together before committing to a film. \nBut Jeremy told Business Insider he wouldn’t be following Bradley’s lead. \n“That’s not my job,” he said. “I don’t know contracts and money and all that sort of stuff. \n“I’m a performer and I know human behaviour. When it comes to that sort of stuff I let other people deal with that. I do what I’m good at, that’s what I focus on.” Jeremy Renner (Michael Plunkett/AP) \nHe added that he supports the idea of equal pay, but wants to focus on acting as a craft. \nHollywood stars tend to leave deals to agents, managers and lawyers – but the much-publicised Sony hack surprised many by laying bare the wage disparity through leaked emails. Promoted stories \nActresses including Jessica Chastain and Rooney Mara have since said they’ve been paid less than male co-stars, while Sienna Miller said she turned down a role in a play that was offering significantly less than was given to the male lead. Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence together in 2012 (Paul Bruinooge/AP) \nJennifer was named by Forbes as 2015′s highest-paid actress in the world, earning 52 million dollars (£33.6 million) – but Robert Downey Jr was the highest-paid actor, with 80 million dollars (£51.7 million). \nShe said in her essay that she learned how much Bradley, Jeremy and the other male actors made on American Hustle through the Sony leaks, and was annoyed at herself for not negotiating harder. \nShe wrote: “But if I’m honest with myself, I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled’. \n“At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the internet and realised every man I was working with definitely didn’t worry about being ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled’.” Jennifer Lawrence (Charles Sykes/Invision) \nBradley has previously been in trouble for his remarks about women. Share article \nEarlier this year the 44-year-old actor faced criticism after he and his Avengers co-star Chris Evans referred to Scarlett Johansson’s character Black Widow as a “slut”.
