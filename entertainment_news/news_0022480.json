For more information, please visit Bell.ca .\nThe Bell Let's Talk Community Fund is supporting 9 organizations in Montréal\nCentre St-Pierre\nCentre St-Pierre's counselling program\nThe project will increase the availability of psychotherapy services to people who do not have the means to get help in the private sector and who are not able to obtain services through the public network. The goal is to give more people access to psychotherapy at rates adapted to their financial situation, so they can unburden themselves, with professional help. With support from the Bell Let's Talk Community Fund, Centre St-Pierre can increase its service offer by 10-15% over the next year.\nNazareth House\nBees, Honey and Hope\nIn 2012, thanks to support from the city of Montréal and Éco-Quartier Peter-McGill, Nazareth House created gardens and green spaces to help its residents reduce stress, enjoy the benefits of sustainable gardening, increase their sense of autonomy and self-esteem, learn to work as a team and get involved in the community. With support from the Bell Let's Talk's Community Fund, Nazareth House was able to build on that success and launch a new initiative, Bees, Honey and Hope, enhancing the mental health services residents currently receive using working with nature as therapy.\nEntraide Saint-Michel\nExplore ta communication\nThanks to the Bell Let's Talk Community Fund grant, the Explore ta communication (explore your communication skills) project will soon be a reality at Entraide Saint-Michel, a mental health day centre. Recognizing that difficulties with daily interactions are often the root cause of conflict and isolation for people living with mental health problems, the project will creat new activities focused on communication in general – expressing oneself, interacting, formulating requests and assessing one's own communication needs – in different social spheres..\nFondation Marie-Vincent\nSpecialized therapy for children aged 12 and under who are victims of sexual abuse\nIn 2005, Fondation Marie-Vincent created the Centre d'expertise Marie-Vincent, which has been making a real difference in the lives of children who are victims of sexual abuse ever since. The Centre brings together the police, medical, psychosocial and sociojudicial services these children need under one roof. It also offers training based on scientific expertise and best practices for professionals who work with young victims. The Bell Let's Talk Community Fund grant will support hiring a professional who will offer direct services for children, facilitating access to specialized services for child victims of sexual abuse.\nFriendship Volunteer Association\nCommunity integration is what I want… The help of an educator is what I need! Accomplishing certain tasks can sometimes be difficult for people living with mental illness. Daily insecurity and anxiety can often prevent them from moving forward at the pace they would like. But with personalized help, regular attendance and intensive educational interventions, not only can they develop the functional skills they need, but they can also improve their self-esteem and acquire abilities that will facilitate their integration into society. With support from the Bell Let's Talk Community Fund, cooking and fitness workshops as well as information sessions will be offered.\nL'Arrêt-Source\nSkills development program\nL'Arrêt-Source is a shelter that offers long-term support to young women in need aged 18 to 30. The shelter's aim is to help the 19 women resident at the shelter as well as the women who visit us each year post-shelter with their reintegration. The Bell Let's Talk Community Fund grant will help expand its skills development program. Adapted to each young woman, this program features weekly group meetings and to help them cope with their mental health problems, as well as develop their physical, psychological, affective and relationship skills.\nMaison L'Éclaircie de Montréal\nCooking workshop\nMaison L'Éclaircie de Montréal is an alternative community organization that houses individuals with mental health problems. The purpose of this project is to foster independent living and teach participants cooking skills. The Bell Let's Talk Community Fund grant will support themed workshops where participants will learn the basics of nutrition, diet and health, and discover how enjoyable preparing a meal can be. In addition to encouraging socialization, these workshops will give participants the opportunity to complete different recipes and learn how to select and prepare foods. The program will also have a component emphasizing how healthy eating can help people feel good about themselves.\nMaison du Père\nA bridge between physical and mental health care and marginalized people\nTo meet the specific needs of its clientele, Maison du Père has a team of 10 employees, including 4 nurses, that offers clinical services and forms a bridge between the network and marginalized people. Thanks to the Bell Let's Talk Community Fund grant, the clinical team will facilitate access to health services for those who find it difficult to adhere to social norms and who are often doubly stigmatized because of their homelessness and mental health struggles. The clinical team oversees the physical and mental health examinations of all the men in the social reintegration program. This project earned an honourable mention at the Ministère de la santé et des services sociaux's awards of excellence.\nPortage\nPortage's MICA (Mentally Ill Chemical Abusers) Program\nFor the past 20 years, Portage has offered a residential program for people suffering from both mental illness (primarily schizophrenia) and substance abuse, treating the two disorders as well as their interaction. To date, Portage's MICA program has assisted more than 700 individuals, giving them the opportunity to live a sober life filled with dignity, self-esteem and success. The Bell Let's Talk Community Fund grant will allow Portage to expand the program to eventually help more men and women.\nMedia inquiries:\nMarie-Eve Francoeur\nBell Media Relations\n514 391-5263\nmarie-eve.francoeur@bell.ca\n@Bell_News\nAndrée- Anne Toussaint\nPress Attaché, Office of the Mayor and Executive Committee\nVille de Montréal\n514-243-1268\nandree-anne.toussaint@ville.montreal.qc.ca\nJulie Papin\nL'Arrêt-Source and spokesperson for the nine recipient organizations\n514 658-2335 or 514 248-2308\nfinancement@arretsource.org\n©2015 PR Newswire.
