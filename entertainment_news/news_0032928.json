From the cultural gazpacho that is New York City comes a mariachi band like no other. Yes, mujeres and wonderful musicians at that. With the precision of scalpel wielding surgeons they’ll tear your heart right out of your chest! \nIn www.amigos805.com I found the following about this mariachi ensemble… Mariachi Flor de Toloache began in New York City in 2008, the brainchild of violinist-vocalist Mireya Ramos, daughter of a mariachi singer who grew up playing the music, ¡Viva el Arte de Santa Barbara! reported in a media release. The band grew from a trio to 10 members with roots in Mexico, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Singapore, Cuba and the United States. They play all the traditional instruments of mariachi music: violin, trumpet, guitar, guitarrón and vihuela. Flor de Toloache performs a diverse array of salsa, Afrobeat, Broadway musical, hip-hop and pop and mariachi music. “Our show is a mix of mariachi classics, mixed with our original tunes and original arrangements of well-known songs from other genres such as jazz, Latin and current pop,” vihuela player Shae Fiol stated in the release. This is a beautiful group of beautifully talented musicians. I’ve fallen in love with them all.
