The actor looks suave and exceptionally fit in his lead role in this week's release. While there aren't many roles that can pose a challenge for an actor of his calibre, Ananth points out that the new generation in the Kannada film industry is, in fact, coming up with some interesting bodies of work. Excerpts...\nAs lead actor of a film at this stage in your career, do you find a lot more roles being written for you lately?\nI was actually worried about being labelled the only lead actor in Plus. There are three other people playing very important characters â€” Chethan Chandra, Ritiesh Kumar and Shalini. But I do find that the new generation in the Kannada film industry has, in fact, come up with some interesting stories and suddenly, there is a variety of roles to play. For me, Plus is the first in the series of such varied roles that I have been working on lately. It is interesting to see that there is a chance for actors to explore more than the run-of-the-mill characters that they end up excelling in.\nWhat about this story was the clincher for you?\nEverybody has a negative aspect to themselves. But how does one convert that negativity into positivity? This is what this story is about and that's exactly what I liked about it. In fact, there is this song called Gelavena daari nodiko, ellave nee dari madiko (Follow the path of victory, if that is not there, create your own path for the same). It has been written by Nagesh, who, incidentally, works as lobby staff at a star hotel. The music has been composed by Bharath BJ. I personally like the vibe and the positivity in that song. It reflects what the film is about and is a true inspiration to the youth. The only hitch is that the song does not feature me in it.\nDid this role involve physical challenges as well?\nI am pretty regular at the gym, I exercise every day irrespective of whether there is a character I need to prepare for or not. But what was cumbersome was the beard that had to be put on and taken off every day. Ideally, if a role required it, I would have just grown my beard. But we did not have the luxury of time for that and had to resort to adding facial fuzz on a daily basis. That can be very itchy and irritating.\nDo you tend to travel a lot for shoots?\nJust to places like Mysuru, Mangaluru etc., which are in and around Karnataka. But I do take off on vacations abroad with my family. The most recent and exciting one was by road across the US from the east coast to the west coast. I look forward to these holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:06:39.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
