We tell true documented stories of the past.\"The hour-and-a-half tours take visitors through the horse barn at the Wyoming Territorial Prison, which Nelson said helps set the mood. Then visitors go on a hayride through historic downtown Laramie, coming back to be led through a candlelight tour of the prison.Throughout the tour, there are re-enactors to bring the stories to life. Nelson said many stories are drawn from Laramie history, but some come from other Wyoming towns.Tour groups contain 25 to 30 people and start every half-hour, bringing the total to six tours a night.\"Truth is scarier than fiction,\" Nelson said. \"You get to participate in it.\" If you go What: A spooky tour of various locations in Laramie, with a history lesson thrown in.
