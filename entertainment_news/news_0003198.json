Now, she's only 7 years old, but we think the adorable texts she sends her father totally make up for it. \n\"Hi, Daddy! I love you so much. I am so proud of you. I miss you so much. I believe in you — that you will make an awesome movie,\" Diesel read from his phone while on \"The Tonight Show.\" \nDiesel shared the sweet message from his oldest daughter Wednesday night while promoting his newest film, \"The Last Witch Hunter,\" on \"The Tonight Show.\" It turns out, she sent him that text message while filming the movie. \nOf course, as Jimmy Fallon pointed out, Diesel's daughter will have to wait a few years to see her dad in the movie, since \"The Last Witch Hunter\" has some pretty adult themes. \nThank goodness she can still watch — we mean hear — Diesel in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in the meantime. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:15:31.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
