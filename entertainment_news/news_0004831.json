By Dennis Knight VIDALIA — Benedictine was looking for a spark after a listless first half at Vidalia, and Tyleek Collins provided it.\nThe speedy sophomore took the second-half kickoff and bobbled the ball for a split second before finding a seam and exploding through it. Collins broke a tackle around the 30-yard line and got to the left sideline before sprinting to the end zone for a 90-yard kickoff return.\nThe play ignited the Cadets, who played a stellar second half to beat Vidalia 27-3 in a critical Region 2-AA matchup. BC improved to 7-0 and 4-0 in the region, and the Cadets are in the driver’s seat in the race for the region crown.\nThe BC offense was out of sorts in the first half as the Cadets had just 4 yards rushing and a pair of first downs. But the Cadet defense kept BC in the ball game as BC led 7-3 at intermission.\n“We had some missed opportunities in the first half — we could have easily been up 17-3,” said Cadet coach Danny Britt, whose team is ranked No. 1 in Class AA by the Georgia Sports Writers Association. “But Tyleek came out and made that return. That gave us a lot of energy, and it was on from there.”\nIndeed it was.\nAfter the kick return, the BC defense forced a three and out. Sophomore quarterback Nick Iannone took over at his own 20-yard line and hit Wesley Kennedy for a gain of 17 in the right flat. Kennedy picked up 15 more out of the wildcat formation two plays later.\nThen Iannone hit Kennedy on an out pattern to the right sideline, and Kennedy cut to his left before going into track-and-field mode and hurdling a defender on his way to a spectacular 43-yard touchdown reception.\n“Wesley is such a great athlete,” Britt said. “That play was pretty sick.”\nThe Cadets got the ball right back when Vidalia mishandled a pooch kick with sophomore Jonah Griffin recovering for BC on the Vidalia 31.\nFive penalties stalled the BC drive, but the chains kept moving after a roughing the punter call on Vidalia.\nFour plays later, Chris Harris got his first carry of the game, and the 230-pound junior made a punishing 13-yard run to the 1-yard line. He bulled his way over the goal line on the next play for the final score of the game with 3 minutes, 55 seconds left in the third quarter.\nThe first half was in stark contrast to the second for the Cadets.\nAfter forcing Vidalia to punt on its first possession, junior Kennedy muffed the catch on a punt return, and the Indians recovered.\nBut the BC defense stood its ground, forcing another three and out as Vidalia chose to punt at the BC 34-yard line, with the punt going into the end zone.\nThe Cadet defense came up big late in the first quarter when defensive back Philip Moore recovered a fumble lost by an Indian ball carrier, setting up the Cadets at the Vidalia 23-yard line. Senior Jacob Collins busted loose for a 16-yard gain up the gut, and two plays later Kennedy found an opening on the left side of the field and sprinted in for a 6-yard scoring run. Jake Karesh’s extra point gave the Cadets a 7-0 lead with 1:17 left in the third quarter.\nCollins had a huge second half, reeling off runs of 36 and 42 yards as he rushed for a career-high 114 yards on 11 carries.\n“We came out a little flat on offense, but our defense kept us in the game,” Jacob Collins said. “Once we got used to the atmosphere and made some adjustments, the offense started moving the ball. We wanted this one as revenge after they beat us last year.”\nIannone was 6 of 12 passing for 133 yards with the touchdown. Kennedy rushed for 41 yards and had 60 yards receiving with the two scores. Nick Whitfield had three receptions for 52 yards for the Cadets.\nVidalia fullback Jadarius Mclendon had an impressive first half, rushing for 78 tough yards on 14 carries. BC shut down the rest of the Vidalia runners, holding them to 19 first-half yards.\nVidalia had seven first downs in the first half but couldn’t cash in with a touchdown. Senior kicker Hector Lara got the Indians on the board with a 39-yard field goal, cutting BC’s lead to 7-3 with 5:14 left in the half.\nBut the BC defense buckled down in the second half, holding Mclendon to 12 yards after intermission. Vidalia rushed for 131 yards and had 155 yards of total offense with just two first downs in the second half.\nGriffin made a fourth-quarter interception, and freshman Eric Hicks recovered a fumble for the Cadets.\n“It was a relief to come out here and beat them after they beat us last year,” BC linebacker Tru’Self Cooper said. “We played more physical in the second half and made our reads. This gives us a lot of confidence; we’re fired up for the rest of the year.”\nBC 7 0 20 0 - 27\nV 0 3 0 0 - 3\nBC-Wesley Kennedy 6 run (Jake Karesh kick)\nV-Hector Lara 39 FG\nBC-Tyleek Collins 90 kickoff return (kick failed)\nBC-Kennedy 43 pass from Nick Iannone (Karesh kick)\nBC-Chris Harris 1 run (Karesh kick)\nRecords-BC 7-0, 4-0 in region; V 4-3, 2-2.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816700.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816700.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816509.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816698.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816509.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816508.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816511.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816511.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816508.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816698.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:11:47.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
