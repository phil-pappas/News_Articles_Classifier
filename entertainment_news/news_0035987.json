Her registration expired on April 30 and she did not apply for renewal. Her program is closed.\"\nOn Friday, a judge ordered that Fearson, 27, undergo a psychiatric evaluation. She is being held without bail on a murder charge.\nA search of the website Child Care Center, US, indicates that a day care Fearson apparently registered in her home on Tiebout Avenue in the Bronx is now closed.\nFearon, dressed in a gray sweatshirt and leggings, was quiet throughout the hearing.\nAssistant District Attorney Rene Aponte said 6-month-old Jahnyla Lawrence was naked and alive in the Bronx apartment when she was dropped out of the window as Fearon's three other children watched in horror. Neighbor Lizette Rodriguez said the woman had been shouting, \"I'm going to throw her. We're all gonna die!\" Other neighbors shouted to the woman, \"Don't do it,\" Rodrgiuez said.\nRodriguez called 911 and said she heard the baby hit the ground while she was on the phone. Prosecutors say the baby died from blunt force trauma.\nOfficers had to take down the apartment door because Fearon wouldn't open it, police said.\nPauline Bryan, who knows Fearon from the neighborhood, said she had just seen her on Tuesday outside the building.\n\"She never told me she had problems,\" Bryan said. \"She's not a mother like that. May God help her.\"\nThe city's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's Services, said it was investigating and was working to ensure the well-being of the three other children.\nThe child's death was the third time in three months a mother had been accused of throwing her infant from a window in New York City.\nLast month, a newborn girl with her umbilical cord attached was found dead outside an apartment building in the University Heights section of the Bronx. Authorities arrested her mother on murder and manslaughter charges, saying she hid her pregnancy and threw the child to her death from a seventh-story window shortly after giving birth.\nInvestigators are also probing the death of another one of her children, initially believed to have died from sudden infant death syndrome.\nIn August, police arrested a Queens woman in connection with the death of her 1-month-old son. According to court papers, she told authorities an evil spirit had possessed the boy and she was \"stopping the pain\" when she threw him from a fourth-floor window.\nBoth women have pleaded not guilty.", "external_links": ["http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/16/bronx-baby-tossed-from-window-mother-charged/"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:55:45.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
