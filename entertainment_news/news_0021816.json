In television, you get to know people on a different level because you have so much time.”\nErica Dasher , who plays the girl, said she and her friends have seen “Prada” multiple times, and calls the characters “much fuller” in “Jane by Design.”\nn Now this is getting into character: Jorge Garcia , who is reunited with “Lost” creator J.J. Abrams on Fox’s “Alcatraz,” has not only taken the tour of the shuttered prison but recorded his own audio tour.\nHis character in “Alcatraz” plays a professor and Alcatraz expert/author who is drafted into an investigation when mysterious bad things start happening.\nn Cee Lo Green , one of the judges/mentors on NBC’s “The Voice,” says TV talent shows may be one of the last places where artists are actually nurtured.\n“Artist development is null and void at most record labels today,” said Green. “This is a place where you can get it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:57:43.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
