In the newest webisodes, a weather-tight home is the goal, as a combination of roofing, housewrap and accessory products are installed on the exterior of the winner's home in North Smithfield, Rhode Island . Four webisodes of the series can currently be enjoyed on the CertainTeed Living Spaces YouTube ® channel and Facebook ® page.\nIn the third webisode of the series, \"It All Starts at the Top – CertainTeed® Landmark® PRO,\" CertainTeed 5-Star® Contractor and SELECT ShingleMaster™ Marshall Building & Remodeling of Riverside, Rhode Island walks winner Danielle Braley and her son, Harrison, though the re-roof process with flashback video and close-ups of the installation. Viewers learn step-by-step how a roof can provide both beauty and performance with the Integrity Roof System™, comprised of premium designer asphalt shingles, underlayments, hip and ridge accessory products and ventilation.\nViewers are treated to an educational journey as workers tear off the old roof and apply WinterGuard™ underlayment to protect vulnerable areas of the roof from the wet New England winter weather. Then DiamondDeck™ underlayment is applied for further protection, and Landmark PRO shingles in Max Def Weathered Wood are installed to give the roof vibrant depth of color and a dramatic appearance. CertainTeed Ridge Vent is also installed to aid in proper attic air flow.\nIn the end, the Braley's are pleasantly surprised to learn the science behind the installation of their roof - one that will provide enviable curb appeal and the promise of protection for many years to come. \"It looks fabulous. I hadn't realized there were so many products that had to be applied before the roof shingles,\" exclaimed Danielle.\nIn the fourth webisode, \"How to Weatherize Exterior Walls with CertaWrap™,\" Marshall Building & Remodeling reveals exactly what goes into waterproofing the sides of a home before the siding is applied. Using the CertaWrap weather resistant barrier, the team easily secures the exterior walls and carefully applies self-adhering CertaFlash™ BA tape around windows and sealing seams. This added layer protects against air and moisture damage plus helps to reduce heating and cooling costs by preventing air infiltration and leakage through gaps, cracks or holes.\nBy entering a video that creatively showed why their home needed a remodel, the Braley's became winners of the $75,000 exterior makeover contest and are starring in a series of CertainTeed Living Spaces webisodes documenting the renovation of their 50-year-old Rhode Island home. The series follows the family, along with local contractors, from the planning stages of the renovation through its completion.\nIn the first few webisodes, Danielle and Harrison selected multiple products, including Landmark PRO roofing, Monogram® vinyl siding, InvisiVent® vinyl soffit, Vinyl Carpentry® trim and much more to work together to combine style, color and durability. They also used CertainTeed digital resources to assist with their decisions, including ColorView® and ColorCoach™. The online tools offered tailored, easy solutions to the often-challenging color, style and design selection process. Choices were narrowed down by a visit to local distributor Harvey Building Products' extensive product display showroom in Lincoln, Rhode Island .\nWebisodes will be released every few weeks and are available for viewing at the CertainTeed Living Spaces Facebook page ( www.facebook.com/certainteedlivingspaces ) and the CertainTeed Living Spaces YouTube Channel ( www.youtube.com/CTLivingSpaces ). Viewers are encouraged to watch for a chance to participate in a variety of Facebook contests during the coming months.\nCertainTeed offers unsurpassed Freedom of Choice® through its industry-leading portfolio of long-lasting polymer, insulated and vinyl siding as well as roofing, fence, railing, decking and exterior trim.
