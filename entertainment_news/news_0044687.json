The 26-year-old Captain of the Signal Corps is posted at Alwar Military Station in Rajasthan and was commissioned into the Indian Army only in March 2013, according to sources. The original complaint was filed nearly two months ago, the committee on sexual harassment of women at workplace met only earlier this month. It has recommended “necessary action” to be initiated against her commanding officer.

The woman officer’s father had written a letter to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar accusing the “higher officers” of giving the accused a “plum posting” in the name of taking action. ”I am the proud father of an Army Officer who marched down the Rajpath this year to showcase the ‘woman power’. I am absolutely disappointed today and the reason is that my daughter was sexually harassed by her Commanding Officer and she complained to the higher ups. “In the name of taking action, the higher officials gave him a plum posting and before leaving the unit, the commanding officer decided to tarnish the image of my child. Now my little child is trying her best to not let her head drop or shoulders drool,” the letter by her father said. He said that since now his daughter’s complaint has finally come to the internal committee on sexual harassment, he is sure the case will get its well deserved hearing. The complaint comes at a time when there is a renewed debate in the defence echelons about how to increase role of women officers. \nModified Date: October 20, 2015 12:40 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:27.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
