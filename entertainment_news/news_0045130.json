They live in a locked garden shed equipped with minimal bathroom facilities and a makeshift kitchen. They never leave. Ever. Until they finally do.\nLarson plays Ma; Jacob Tremblay (who was 8 when the film was shot) plays her son, Jack. Despite the sordid premise (loosely inspired by the Elisabeth Fritzl case in Austria), the film isn't a horror show nor a crime story about a psycho and the people he's locked up. The focus is on how Ma and Jake — the latter of whom is never perturbed about their circumstances — function day to day. They call their prison, simply enough, Room, and they eventually escape it (and the sexual abuse Ma has had to endure) and find that their adjustment to the outside world is anything but smooth.\nLarson has been acting since she was a child herself. Maybe you saw her in her Disney Channel days. Or maybe you first became aware of her as Toni Collette's amusingly insolent teenager on the Showtime series \"United States of Tara.\" Or perhaps it was her turn in \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" or her appearance in the Jenny Lewis music video for \"Just One of the Guys\" alongside Anne Hathaway and Kristen Stewart, actresses who had far more recognition than Larson at the time.\nThat's changing fast. With her performance in \"Room,\" Larson's name will likely be in the mix when Oscar nominations come around. It's a performance worth singling out, unvarnished and grounded but also one that finds small pockets for wit and a strong through-line of intelligence.\nThose same qualities came through when I sat down with her earlier this week, as well. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\nQ: I was claustrophobic watching you and this kid live in such tight confines in the first half of the movie. I know on most TV and movie sets, the walls can be removed to make room for the camera. Was it like that on this film?\n'Room' review: A harrowing mother-son tragedy Michael Phillips Much of the effectiveness of \"Room\" — and it's very effective — depends on not knowing every narrative turnabout in advance. We'll be as clear as we can while hinting around at a few things regarding director Lenny Abrahamson's splendidly acted, if ever-so-slightly dodgy, film version of the 2010...\nMuch of the effectiveness of \"Room\" — and it's very effective — depends on not knowing every narrative turnabout in advance. We'll be as clear as we can while hinting around at a few things regarding director Lenny Abrahamson's splendidly acted, if ever-so-slightly dodgy, film version of the 2010...\n(Michael Phillips) A: Well, there were pieces of the wall that could come out. There were even full walls that could come out, but we never did that because we wanted to keep that sense of intimacy there at all times. So even when pieces of the wall came out, Lenny Abrahamson (the film's director) wanted the camera to be flush with the wall to keep the perspective of this room and get a good visualization of what that space is.\nQ: Did it feel cramped when you were filming in there?\nA: Um, yeah? But not in a bad way? More in an intimate way. We shot in chronological order, and we had spent three weeks before that really creating that space in Room. Jacob and I built toys (such as a garland made of halved eggshells) and we did drawings of one another, and then we could walk down to the set and put the pictures up that we had made and put the toys we made in Room and we would do improvs and just play in there for a couple hours every day.\n'Room' author Emma Donoghue on its unusual path to the big screen Jenelle Riley When Emma Donoghue 's novel \" Room \" was published in 2010, it became an instant sensation, landing on several bestseller lists and inspiring an avid following.

Readers fell in love with the story of Jack, a five-year-old boy who has lived his entire life in a single room with his \"Ma.\"\nWhile it might...\n(Jenelle Riley) So by the time we started shooting, it was a very comfortable space for us, and one that we really enjoyed being in. It was very special. So shooting in there became just this safe, sacred space that we could enter and play as Ma and Jack — and the door was unlocked, we could walk out whenever we wanted — so it became this little portal.\nQ: Like a womb.\nA: Exactly, that's the idea — the idea is that it is the womb, and the escape is the birth.\nQ: Someone on Twitter had a completely different take on it and said the movie was basically an allegory for attachment parenting.\nA: Totally! It's also the allegory of, when is it time for you to allow your kid to go out in the world and perhaps fail? They have to do it on their own and you can't protect them from everything.\nThe beauty of Room — even though there is this monster that invades the space — is that it's a very simple space where you know where the good is and you know where the bad is.\nIt's very much like childhood, where it's very safe and clear — there are my friends, my family, this is my home that's safe. Everything can be pretty easily compartmentalized between good and bad.\nBut once Jack gets out into the world, you see this larger perspective where suddenly good and bad are not so clear — that people can be both and the world is a contradiction and everything is not as clear anymore.\nThat boy, Jack, becomes this little shadow of the past that's living and growing and following her around that, as hard as she might want to try to get rid of the past, she will never be able to, because this is a tie for her for life. And I think it's a perfect metaphor for whatever painful experiences we have in our lives that we deeply want to get away from, but ultimately realize that the only way to move forward is by loving it and nurturing it and holding hands with it and walking with it.\nQ: Room is invaded by this threatening guy on a regular basis, and despite this, Ma is still able to create that womb feeling, to create this fantasy — or, I don't know if that's the right word ...\nA: It is. And it happens in real life. You create this fantasy for your kids. You don't want them to grow up too fast. The world's too complicated for them to understand, so you have to take things close and make things very clear and easy.\nMa has been stuck in this room for years and thinking about what's going on outside of it — she has all these ties, these friends, a family and all of this stuff that's out in the world that she can't get to — whereas Jack has no idea that there's anything outside of it so Room becomes everything. And then she can sort of fall into that fantasy of, \"This is everything.\" And because she's constantly around this little bouncing boy of optimism, she can grab on to that and use that as a way to find a purpose throughout the day.\nQ: He's not freaked out about the fact that they're trapped in this small room.\nA: There's no reason to be — he doesn't understand. He doesn't understand even the terror of the night. Just for him, he goes to bed, he maybe hears the door (when Ma's captor enters), he hears a squeaky bed, he likes to count how many squeaks there are from the bed, he falls asleep and then that's it — and it's a great day tomorrow.\nQ: Do you wonder though if a kid would eventually question the fact that they never leave that room?\nA: I think that for the sake of this story, Ma starts to think that this mythology is going to be questioned and won't last as he gets older, and that's what I think part of the fuel is for her feeling like, \"We need to get out, because what am I going to do when he is a young man? Is he still going to believe? He's not going to question it?\" Your brain becomes much more intelligent and complex and able to see outside of the illusion. We all grow up believing in Santa Claus, and then at a certain point we realize that it's just not plausible. So I think that that's similar to the function of this story — she's recognizing that the questions he's asking and the way that this monster (their captor) is trying to connect with him, what would happen if the two of them got along? If suddenly this man took a liking to her boy? That's a huge threat. So all of that sort of snaps her out of that slumber that she's in and says, \"We have to get out.\"\nQ: Not long after I saw the film I read a story about this community in Oakland, Calif., called Containertopia where people pay $600 a month to live in repurposed shipping containers because housing is so expensive, this is all they can afford. The dimensions are probably pretty close to that of Room. Granted, there's a difference between sleeping there at night and being trapped there forever.\nA: The big difference being a door that opens .\nBut I've spent so much time in India traveling, and that's the best example I can give of the smallest of conditions. Homes, to a majority of the population there, are not what we would consider a home at all. It's a piece of recycled material propped up against a wall and you're on the street and you're next to thousands of people who are doing the same thing — and yet it is not a place you go to and think, \"Gosh, this is a real downer.\" It is full of life and it's celebratory and spiritual and you see thousands of thousands of people that go out on the beach to watch the sunset, every night. They're just making ends meet doing the best that they can, and there is this simplicity to it that is complete liberation. We get so attached to our stuff — if this thing were taken away, I would be sad — but your stuff isn't you. You're stuff isn't a reflection of yourself.\nQ: Ma is probably as close to a perfect victim as you're going to get in that Nancy Grace stereotypical way — a white suburban teenager kidnapped. But after she escapes, you see people question the choices she made during her captivity and asking, \"Why didn't you do this?\" or \"Why didn't you do that?\" as if there is any right way to survive a situation like that.\nA: There's a very strong thing that happens in our culture called victim shaming and I read that it happens a lot for girls who were kidnapped. People would say, \"Well, why didn't you try harder to get out?\" It's heartbreaking to think that there's a side of us that does that, and it's because we can't handle the idea that it could happen to us. We're confused by it and angry about it. We want to believe that there's a way out — and we can't handle that there was no way out for them. So we go, \"Well, you must have not tried hard enough.\"\nQ: This movie brings out all sorts of conflicted thoughts I have about child actors .\nA: Yeah, that's rightly so.\nQ: Movies and TV would feel so empty if they didn't include children, but it doesn't seem like such a great thing for the kids themselves, to have a job where there are all these adult expectations and responsibilities. Then again, this isn't Dickens — child actors aren't working in a boot blacking factory!\nA: I think it comes down to whether it's the kid's choice or not. I think there's this fear that the child is not old enough to understand, or have the ability to say that this is what they want to do and this is their choice.\nQ: You're uniquely suited to talk about this.\nA: I wanted to be an actor at 6, really badly, and that's when I started. And it had nothing to do with my parents. They always just facilitated it and helped with it, and were also very clear that if at some point this did not work for me anymore, that was OK.\nJacob is the same way in this case. That's not always the case, but in this case, this is a kid who loves it and is choosing it and is actually very gifted at it. And for him he got to play and get rolled up in a rug and carried around, which he would giggle and laugh hysterically through, and we would have to tell him to be quiet. He got to do two days of stunt work where he jumps out of the back of a truck, which for him was like, \"I'm Tom Cruise!\"\nBecause this story has such an emotional center to it we think, \"Oh God, I can't believe this child did this.\" But you have to remember, this is a child who was laughing and had zero concept of the movie we were making the entire time. For him it's just, \"Yeah, it's another day when I get to have breakfast and lunch with Brie and I get to jump around on this bed and I get to yell if I want and I'm allowed.\"\nIt's always a choice for him. Het gets to choose which projects that he does and his parents are rad and he doesn't have to do it unless he wants to.\nQ: What was it like for you as a kid? Because when you are cast in something, you can't do the normal kid thing of saying, \"I don't feel like it today.\"\nA: I never felt like that. Because I wanted it.\nQ: What about the idea of being exposed? You become famous, or maybe just recognizable, at a young age.\nA: My face wasn't in enough places for me to be a conversation. I just got to do what I loved and didn't have to deal with any sort of weirdness of being recognized. I got to keep my head down and do what I loved to do.\nnmetz@tribpub.com\nTwitter @NinaMetzNews\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Kidnapping Entertainment Tom Cruise Kristen Stewart Movies Amy Schumer Toni Collette", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/t/room/", "http://variety.com/t/emma-donoghue/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627d442/turbine/sc-room-mov-rev-1019-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56291213/turbine/ct-emma-donoghue-room-interview-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628f053/turbine/ct-brie-larson-room-metz-ae-1025-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:24:13.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
