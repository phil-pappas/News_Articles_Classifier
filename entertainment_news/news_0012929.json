Obama said Kanye will have to \"deal with strange characters who behave as if they are on a reality TV show\" and warned him the phrase \"beautiful dark twisted fantasy\" is considered \"off-message\" in politics, the Daily News reports. According to the Times , Obama—who offered Kanye as a solution to Republicans' current House speaker troubles—ended by joking: “Do you really think this country is going to elect a black guy from the south side of Chicago with a funny name to be president of the US?” President Barack Obama on stage during a Democratic fundraiser at the Warfield Theater Saturday in San Francisco.
