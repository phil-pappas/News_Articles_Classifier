(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) LAS VEGAS (FOX5/AP) - \nFormer NBA and reality television star Lamar Odom remained hospitalized in Las Vegas after he was found unconscious at a brothel near Pahrump on Tuesday. \nAccording to the Nye County Sheriff’s Office, an ambulance was called to Dennis Hof’s Bunny Ranch about 3:15 p.m. after Odom was found unconscious in a room there. \nAuthorities said that Odom was first taken to a local hospital, where he was stabilized. He was then taken to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, about 70 miles away. He had to be taken to Las Vegas by ground because he was too tall to be transported by air. \nOdom’s condition was not immediately released. However, Jesse Jackson spoke to MORE's Sean McAllister outside the hospital, and said that Odom is in a coma and on life support. He said Odom was moving and coughing. \nAt least a dozen photographers could be seen standing outside the hospital Wednesday morning. \nAccording to TMZ , Odom’s ex-wife Khloe Kardashian was by his side in his Las Vegas hospital room, as well as Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner. \nTMZ also reported that former teammate Kobe Bryant left a preseason game of the Los Angeles Lakers that was being played in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to be by Odom’s bedside. \nOdom has played for both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers, as well as the Miami Heat and the Dallas Mavericks. \nThe 35-year-old retired from the NBA in 2013 and saw reality TV fame through his four-year marriage to Khloe Kardashian. \nCopyright 2015 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation).
