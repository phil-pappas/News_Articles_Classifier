That’s why author Deanna Kahler set out to write books that deal with overcoming life challenges. Since publishing her first book, \"From Pain to Parenthood,\" in 2013, Kahler has received numerous accolades for her work. This month, she was nominated for her seventh book award, the 2016 Global EBook Awards. Kahler’s nominated book, \"Echoes of Paradise,\" deals with a subject that affects every person—death. According to the World Health Organization, more than 56 million people die in the world each year. These losses leave families and friends in a deep state of grief. Some question their faith; some are filled with regrets. And most wonder exactly what happens after death. \"Echoes of Paradise\" explores these concerns by taking readers on a journey through grief and spiritual awakening. In the book, main character Celeste finds out her one true love has passed away. She then begins noticing strange coincidences that lead her on a quest for answers.\n“To those who have lost the great love of your life—read this story,” says an Amazon reader. “It's message of hope and encouragement in the midst of grief and despair is profound and enlightening.”\nKahler felt compelled to write the book after having a few of her own experiences. She hopes her story will offer comfort and remind people of the unbreakable bonds that connect them to others—no matter where they are.\n\"Echoes of Paradise\" is available in both print and ebook on Amazon.com. For those who are interested in meeting the author, she will participate in the Books & Authors event at lifestyle store Leon & Lulu in Clawson, Mich., on Oct. 25 from 11-5. Signed copies of her books will be available.\nAbout the Author\nDeanna Kahler is an accomplished writer who enjoys the opportunity to reach others and make a difference in their lives.
