The pair had dated on and off since 2012. \nShe left behind a suicide note professing her love for the comic, Radar Online reported. \n“Jim, I love you,” White wrote. “Please forgive me. I’m not for this world.” \nShe was laid to rest in Cappawhite Cemetery beside her late father, Pat, who died in 2012 after a long battle with brain cancer. Carrey and White reportedly rekindled their relationship in May this year. Source: Supplied \nThe 52-year-old actor returned to Twitter for the first time in almost a month on Saturday, just hours after laying to rest his ex-girlfriend. \n“Love cannot be lost,” he wrote alongside a shadow silhouette of himself with White and a red rose emoji. Love cannot be lost.  pic.twitter.com/XxPYOhkdzc — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) October 10, 2015 \nFollowing the news of White’s death, her family released a statement to the Irish Independent , celebrating her life: “The family of Cathriona White sincerely regret the untimely passing of their beloved daughter and sister,” they said. \n“Cathriona was a shining light in our lives who was loved deeply by her entire family. We will miss her terribly and at this difficult time we ask to be left in private to mourn our loss.” \nCarrey paid for White’s funeral services, sources told Radar Online. \nIf you or someone you know needs help, please contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, or visit Beyond Blue’s website.
