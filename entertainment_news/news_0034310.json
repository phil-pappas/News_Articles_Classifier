South Whatcom Firefighters Association sponsors the annual event from 7 a.m. to noon Saturday, Oct. 10, at South Whatcom Fire Authority’s Station 21, 4518 Cable St. in the Geneva neighborhood. \nIn addition to fire engine and station tours, there will be a fire safety house where children can learn about what to do in case of a house fire — and they’ll be able to practice escaping their bedroom in a mock emergency. \nMenu includes pancakes, eggs and ham. Admission is $5 per person or $15 for a family. A portion of the proceeds benefits Daniel Lyon , the U.S. Forest Service firefighter who was critically injured in last summer’s deadly wildfire near Twisp. \nRobert Mittendorf is a volunteer firefighter with South Whatcom Fire Authority and will be volunteering at this event.
