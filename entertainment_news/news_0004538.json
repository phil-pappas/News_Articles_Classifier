A silent auction, 50/50 raffle and wine pull will also be available. \nAppetizers provided by Foodie’s as well as a cash bar and (hopefully) a fall sunset across the bay will complete the night. \n“What has been truly amazing about this year’s Casino & Auction night is the width and breadth of support we’ve received from local businesses,” said Jen Begonia, LBI PTA vice president and event chairwoman. “Over 100 merchants, service providers, restaurants and more from end-to-end on the Island and over the Causeway have contributed as sponsors and donors. We have more than $12,000 in prizes to offer thanks to the generosity of our community. \n“A fun fact is that our PTA president, Tom Beaty, donated one of his handmade alaias (valued at $250) to the silent auction. We believe he is the first male president ever in our district,” she added. “Our former president, Karen Beetel, parent to four LBI District students and employee at EJ School, as well as a licensed massage therapist, is donating a massage. ” \nProceeds from the event will help raise funds for events and programs for students and staff of the LBI Consolidated School District, which includes the Long Beach Island Grade School and Ethel A. Jacobsen Elementary School. \n“All of the funds we raise go directly to support the kids and educators in these schools,” said Begonia. “Our organization contributes to field day, cultural arts assemblies, special evening and weekend programs, a school garden, college scholarships, after-school enrichment, reading fairs (including a free book for each student), field trips and much more.” \nTickets to the event cost $40 and are only available in advance. To purchase tickets, visit lbipta.org/casino-auction-night-invite/ . The printed form can be delivered to the EJ School before 3 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 16, or postmarked by the same date. —K.A.E.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:52:59.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
