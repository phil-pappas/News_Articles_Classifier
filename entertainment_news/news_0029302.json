Previous Next Enlarge Instagram is adding a new app to its collection and it's called Boomerang .\nThe company's new video app will let users turn a burst of photos into one second looping videos, which somewhat resemble a GIF.\n\"Today, we're announcing Boomerang from Instagram, a new video app that lets you turn everyday moments into something fun and unexpected,\" Instagram wrote in a blog post.\nTo capture a video, users just have to tap the capture button and the app takes care of the rest. Videos, or Boomerangs, will automatically save to the phone's camera roll.\nThe app obviously works best when trying to capture a moving item or person. For example, users can capture a friend performing a cartwheel or a car zooming by.\nBoomerangs are also very similar to Apple's Live Photos , which capture moving items in real time and recreates them as moving images.\nThis is the third app Instagram releases to enhance users' experience. The first was Hyperlapse and the second was Layout , which lets users create borderless collages.\nBoomerang is available for both iOS and Android beginning Oct. 23.\nRelated Stories Instagram introduces 30-sec video ads Instagram adds selfie camera, emoji to its direct messages", "external_links": ["http://blog.instagram.com/post/131684343987/boomerang-from-instagram"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:40.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
