The body count this episode was the highest it's been since the pilot, giving the story a bit more action. Despite this episode's upward movement from past ones, someone on the Scream Queens staff needs to be fired immediately (or taken out by the Red Devil) for agreeing to have neither Denise nor Gigi in the episode! Shame\n The episode begins with a direct continuation of last week's final scene. The KKT girls vote for their new president, using white marbles for Chanel #1 and black ones for Zayday. Chanel #1 enlists the candle vlogger, Jennifer, to count the votes. Shockingly, it's a tie. But, according to KKT rules, in the case of a tie, both ladies must share the title and be co-presidents. Immediately, Chanel #1 blames Chanel #5 for her loss and storms off in a fit of tears.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Steve Dietl/FOX More From Cosmopolitan In her closet, Chanel #1 weeps when Chanels #3 and #5 walk in to console her. Like the unstable girl she is, Chanel #1 seamlessly transitions her tears to laughter and confesses that she is fine with the tie for presidency. She would have actually preferred Zayday to win outright because as she learned from Mafia films, in moments of crisis, it's best not to be the leader. This is because, when terrible things happen, you're the first one people suspect and you're the no. 1 target. This is a real-life game of life or death and Chanel #1 plans to outlive everyone.\nDownstairs, Chanel #1 extends her support to Zayday by giving her the key to the sketchy basement where all of KKTs secrets and the dead baby bathtub are stored. Zayday accepts and settles into her reign by planning a slumber party with the help of Grace. The two want to lock the house down, keeping every sequestered together in one room so that secrets will be revealed.\nWhen Zayday tells her pledges about the party, nearly everyone is down. Chanel #3, however, is insistent on them playing spin the bottle. Chanel #1 can't imagine why she'd want to play that game when there are \"no dickies around.\" No matter how confused they all are, everyone agrees to the game to appease Chanel #3.\nOver at DDS, the guys play some sort of pasta sauce-chugging game. It looks rowdy and nasty. As always, Chad is super hype, but Earl Grey (who still needs to be steeped in a pot of boiling water, and poured out gently into the finest of china, to be sipped on slowly and intently) attempts to chill his vibe, confessing that they're all gathered together for an intervention regarding Chad's sexual liaisons with older women, namely Dean Munsch and Denise. Everyone in the house thinks it's weird that he sleeps with so many old people, and they're worried. Chad understands where they're coming from and realizes that he should be focusing his energy on porking the popular girls and Chanel #1. After getting through to his boy, Earl Grey tells the guys about the KKT slumber party. He also suggests a \"panty raid.\" The guys agree to crash the KKT event and head out.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Steve Dietl/FOX The slumber party begins and the girls sit around a small table in their pajamas with an empty bottle in front of them. Though she's still confused, Chanel #1 spins first and it lands on Jennifer, the candle vlogger. Of course, Chanel #1 is not kissing her, so Chanel #6 acts as her proxy and pecks Jennifer on the lips. According to Chanel #6, Jennifer tastes like wax. Chanel #3 immediately takes her turn spinning the bottle, hoping to get Sam, her lesbian crush. The bottle first lands on Grace and Chanel #3 spins again. This time the bottle lands on Sam. Chanel #3 and Sam intensely kiss. After their kiss the game is over.\nSam is in the bathroom practicing her disinterested face, when Chanel #3 walks in. Chanel #3 tells Sam that if she could feel, she would have feelings for her. There's also talk of Charles Manson, Chanel #3's father, and how he always ruins things for her when she's in love. Because of him, Chanel #3 confesses to Sam that their vaginas must never touch because bad things happen to her when she's in love. Like, with her ex, who was so obsessed with her ears that he threatened to cut them off if he ever saw them again. This is why she wears earmuffs all the time.\nIn the kitchen, the rest of the KKT ladies are making \"packing peanut s'mores\" —the packing peanuts are a replacement for marshmallows and cut calories. Yum. Jennifer and Sam interrupt to tell the girls that the whole house has been locked. All doors, and all windows. So, they're trapped inside. Everyone communes in the living room, and Chanel #1 confesses that she made the whole house into a Panic Room, but there's no switch to turn off all the locks because the guy who installed it was missing a part and never came back to add it. Chanel #6 isn't too pressed, because she thinks it's clear that one of them is the killer and that they will pick everyone off one by one as the night goes on. Just then, the lights go out.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x332/gallery-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x320/gallery-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x853/gallery-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x531/gallery-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x512/gallery-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x678/gallery-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x1107/gallery-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x653/gallery-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x426/gallery-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x1066/gallery-1445448112-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0177r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x885/gallery-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x442/gallery-1445448024-screamqueens-ep106-pjparty-0025r-hires1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:43:04.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
