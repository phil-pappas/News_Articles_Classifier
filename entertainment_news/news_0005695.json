As the CEO of KAC Productions, Kevin and his business partner Stacy Lyles are part of the production force behind Social Media's First Family and next reality TV movement.\nAs a friend of the family patriarch, Warren Sr., Kevin instantly saw the potential in the family once Morgan approached him to manage her career. After years of investing time, money, and passion while seeing Morgan and her sister's growing social media presence, he birthed the idea of the \"First Family of Social Media.\"\nIt was that level of dedication to the Westbrooks and their awe-inspiring journey that was instrumental in the development of The Westbrooks social media presence. 2.5 million followers later, The Westbrooks are ready to take their stardom from the web to television. As the world awaits the premiere of their highly anticipated show, Kevin and Stacy couldn't be more proud of India , Crystal, Morgan, Bree, Brooke, their equally talented brothers, and their loving parents.\nWhat Kevin noticed more than 3 years ago about the absolute wonder of the Westbrooks siblings, the world will get to see tonight on BET at 10pm ET /PT.\nTune-in tonight to see for yourself, as The Westbrooks siblings are intriguing, and intuitively talented; but they are not the Jacksons. They possess incredible business savvy; but, they are not the Kardashians. They possess a shakable, and unbreakable family bond; yet, they are not the Braxtons. Happily, they are the Westbrooks; unequivocally the world's First Family of Social Media. Join the 2.5 Million people that are currently following their every movement and prepare to be hooked.\nABOUT THE WESTBROOKS\nIndividually - India , Crystal, Morgan, Brooke, Bree and their brothers have a purpose, passion, desire, and plan that is highly important in contributing to their personal success but it is their Westbrooks bond where they will truly find, nurture, and cement their significance. \"Family is not an important thing, it's everything.\"\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277162\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kevin-fisher-and-stacy-lyles-of-kac-productions-present-the-world-premiere-of-the-westbrooks-on-bet-300160181.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
