Randy Taraborrelli interviews numerous people within the international superstar's inner circle.\nBeyoncé herself seemed to stop giving face-to-face interviews around 2013, sharing very little with the media that she doesn't control herself either on her Instagram or personal website. In fact, in a recent interview -- said to be her first in two years -- the most revealing piece of personal information she shared was her favorite pizza topping.\nPerhaps due to Queen Bey's increased privacy, Taraborrelli insists that his book is the closest anyone will come to knowing the truth about the singer's life. \"I think when you read it, you'll be left understanding her a lot more,\" he tells ET.\nIn our eye-opening interview with the author, which will air on Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, Taraborrelli addresses these seven big bombshells in Becoming Beyoncé.\n1. Rihanna and the Alleged Love Triangle\nTaraborrelli says that Jay Z has never cheated on Beyoncé in their 15 years of being together. As for those rumors that the rapper started seeing Rihanna after signing her as an artist? The author claims that was all for show, saying a false report was fabricated by a publicist connected to Jay Z and Rihanna in order to \"boost her career\" and get the Barbados native's first song, \"Pon De Replay,\" up on the charts. \"It was total fiction,\" Taraborrelli says.\nWatch: Jay Z Adorably Calls Out Beyonce's Pizza Preference However, he says the rumor did drive a wedge between Beyoncé and Jay Z. \"Beyoncé didn't know what to make of this, and it actually ended up breaking them up for a time,\" he claims. \"They spent maybe a year apart from each other because Beyoncé just wasn't sure of what to make of the situation with Rihanna.\"\n\"It's safe to say that Rihanna and Beyonce are friends ,\" Taraborelli adds of the singers' current relationship.\n2. The Elevator Incident\nFollowing the 2014 Met Gala in New York City, Jay Z, Beyoncé and her sister, Solange Knowles, made headlines after video from an elevator surveillance camera was leaked. The tape revealed a physical altercation between Jay and his sister-in-law, but it did not include audio, and specifically what caused the argument has yet to be disclosed.\n\"I think it's safe to say the only people who know for sure what happened are Bey, Jay, Solange and the bodyguard who were in the elevator,\" Taraborrelli says of the incident. The author has heard from eyewitnesses at the Met Gala that the argument occurred after Beyoncé told Jay Z he could not go to Rihanna's after party.\nWatch: Blue Ivy shows off her awesome dance moves \"It was a whispered married couple's argument that would have gone by completely unnoticed had not Solange overheard it,\" he adds. \"Solange has always been Beyoncé's biggest protector.\"\n3. The Blue Ivy Contract\nAccording to the book, Beyoncé has those looking after her daughter, Blue Ivy , sign a contract titled the \"Daily Program for Blue Ivy as Per Mrs. Carter.\"\n\"If you are a nanny coming into her household, and you think you are going to just raise Blue Ivy the way you want to, that's not gonna happen,\" Taraborrelli explains. \"Beyoncé has sort of an agreement, a structure of how she wants her child to be raised and you have to adhere to this.\"\n4. Beyoncé's First Boyfriend\nTaraborrelli claims Beyoncé has only had two boyfriends in her life: Lyndell Locke and Jay Z. Taraborrelli says that Locke told him that in the early stages of her relationship with Jay Z, Beyoncé allegedly would \"do anything\" he told her to do. In the book, Taraborrelli reports that one of those things was getting Locke uninvited to Solange's baby shower and, angered by this, Locke decided it \"had to be over\" with Beyoncé.\nThe book says that Locke still looks back fondly at his time with Beyoncé. \"I learned a lot about what it meant to have a good woman,\" Locke is Quote: d as saying. \"She's still the first girl I ever kissed at that Brian McKnight concert so long ago, when we were little kids. That stays with you. ...I guess it's true what they say: You don't forget your first love.\"\n5. Baby Rumors\nPerhaps one of the more outrageous allegations in the book involves Alex Wright, the former girlfriend of Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles. According to Taraborrelli, Wright claims that when she was pregnant, Mathew suggested she give the child to his daughter. \"At one point, he even floated the idea of me handing over the baby to Beyoncé and Jay Z to adopt and then raise as their own,\" Taraborrelli Quote: s Wright. \"I doubt that he even approached Beyoncé with the idea.\"\nAs for speculation that Beyoncé had a fake baby bump when she was pregnant with Blue Ivy, Taraborrelli insists there is no truth to that. \"It was so ridiculous, but it became such a huge headlining story,\" he says. \"I mean, it just shows you how big she is as an icon in our culture.\"\n6. The Secret Album\nIn December 2013, Beyoncé blew everyone away when she released an entire album , complete with music videos, without anyone knowing ahead of time.\nTaraborrelli says in the book that the dancers in Beyoncé's top secret music videos were not even made aware as to what exactly they were filming. \"We knew the song titles but we didn't know how or even in what form the videos would be coming out,\" Tenesha Ksyn Cason, aka Miss Keyn, tells the author. \"It was actually thrilling.\"\nWatch: Beyonce and Ed Sheeran perform epic 'Drunk In Love' Duet Miss Keyn quips that she got nervous when posting on social media, as she often used the hashtag #Flawless on her makeup tutorials. \"I thought, 'Oh no, I can't use that hashtag right now because that's the name of one of the secret songs!'\" she recalls in the book. \"They're gonna think I'm hashtagging a song from the album.\"\n7. Queen Bey's Just Like Us?\nTaraborrelli also tells ET that despite being one of the most famous women in the world, Beyoncé remains unpretentious. \"I think it's Beyoncé's temperament that's just kept her level-headed,\" he says. \"She's a humble person just by nature.\"\n\"Becoming Beyoncé: The Untold Story\" will be released on Oct. 27.\nET has reached out to Beyoncé and Mathew Knowles.", "external_links": ["http://www.etonline.com/news/174327_beyonce_gives_first_print_interview_years/", "http://www.etonline.com/music/153386_speaking_beyonce_all_the_lingo_we_didn_t_know_this_time_last_year/", "http://www.etonline.com/showfinder/", "http://www.etonline.com/awards/grammys/159487_blue_ivy_approved_of_rihanna_poufy_pink_grammy_gown/", "http://www.etonline.com/music/149222_beyonce_addresses_elevator_drama_surprise_nicki_minaj_flawless_remix/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/172790_beyonce_and_ed_sheeran_perform_epic_drunk_in_love_duet_at_global_citizen_festival/", "http://www.etonline.com/celebs/beyonce/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/172091_beyonce_shares_adorably_candid_photo_of_her_and_blue_ivy_on_their_italian_yacht_vacation/", "http://www.etonline.com/news/174407_jay_z_talks_beyonce_pizza_preference_on_jimmy_kimmel_live/"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:00:22.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
