Photo: Steven Siewert \nActor Sean Taylor says life as the husband of Hollywood hot property Jacki Weaver hasn't really changed that much.\n\"But it does mean I get bumped up to business class!\" he laughs. \"I also spend a lot of time in Los Angeles now and I meet people I would never normally meet. But Jacki's success hasn't changed my career because I don't have a visa to work in America â€“ although I'm hoping that might change next year.\"\nSouth African-born Taylor, married to two-time Oscar nominated Weaver since 2003, is enjoying the ride, even if it feels like it's on coattails. \"It is astonishing to watch her on this rollercoaster,\" he says. \"I'm very proud of her. I think it's fantastic what she's going through and she is loving it.\"\nSean Taylor and Jacki Weaver. Photo: Steve Lunam \nFor the moment, however, work has separated the couple. While Weaver is in Hollywood, Taylor is in Kirribilli, preparing for his role in the Ensemble Theatre's production of David Hare's drama My Zinc Bed . He's enjoying the change of pace.\nAdvertisement \"If I wasn't with Jacki, Los Angeles would be the last place I'd live,\" he says. \"It's fine and I read a lot and I go for lots of walks and go for lots of dinners with interesting people. I get all the Hollywood gossip. But I wish Jacki would f--king move to New York. That would be much more fun. I love New York!\"\nMixing with the rich and powerful may come in handy for My Zinc Bed , in which Taylor plays charismatic millionaire Victor, who hires young poet Paul (Sam O'Sullivan) to work as a copywriter for his technology company. Victor is married to Elsa (Danielle Carter), who, like Paul, is a recovering alcoholic. An affair is soon on the cards.\n\"There is an interesting Mephistophelian aspect to the story in that Victor, my character, manipulates the situation,\" Taylor says. \"He brings the young man in and Hare holds out the possibility that Victor actually wants this man to have an affair with his wife.\"\nThe marriage has grown stale, Taylor says. \"Maybe this will revitalise it. Apparently you get people who do things like that. They throw the keys into a bowl and say, whoever gets my key can take me home. Like a swingers' party!\" he chuckles. \"But of course, that sort of thing was long before my time.\"\nCarter, who is semi-regular on the Ensemble Theatre stage and a familiar face to viewers of the TV series House Husbands , says My Zinc Bed deals frankly with the nature of addiction and desire.\n\"It's about love in all its shapes and forms and about betrayal in all its forms,\" she says. \"You have to get to grips with what 'need' is and what 'want' is. It's a bit like peeling an onion.\"\nAnd being a David Hare play, politics is never far from the surface, Taylor adds. \"There is always a political theme in his work and here he's asking why Victor, a man who used to be so idealistic, has become so cynical. It's like the two male characters are two sides of David Hare. There is David Hare who was the young poet and leftie, and then there is David Hare who is now Sir David Hare.\"\nBoth actors say they are relishing the opportunity to work on a play by a master of the craft.\n\"It's such a joy to learn good writing,\" Taylor says. \"So much better than learning bad writing, which happens a lot in television. I always pity people playing paramedics: it's always, 'hang in there mate, hang in there'. I can just see a writer at their computer thinking, that will be good, 'hang in there, mate!' \"\nMy Zinc Bed plays until November 22, Ensemble Theatre; $25-$69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:51:24.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
