Kirill Petrenko... \nBERLIN (AP) - Kirill Petrenko will take over as chief conductor at the Berlin Philharmonic in 2019, and will do the new job alongside his existing role as the Bavarian State Opera's musical director for the first two years. \nThe Philharmonic in June chose the Russian-born Petrenko to succeed chief conductor Simon Rattle, who is leaving in 2018. The orchestra initially left open when he would start. \nOn Tuesday, it said Petrenko will take over at the beginning of the 2019-2020 season but will give a reduced number of concerts in his first year because of his duties at the Bavarian State Opera. \nPetrenko will remain the Munich opera house's musical director until August 2020, and will be a guest conductor there in the 2020-21 season.
