Tracy Smith has our Sunday Profile:\n36 Photos John Cleese The Monty Python veteran and creator of \"Fawlty Towers\" is pleased to point out the silliness in the world\nJohn Cleese says he realized very early on \"it's much easier to be clever than to be funny. Much easier.\"\nMeaning? \"It's very, very hard, really, to make people laugh.\"\nIt's a well-known truth that comedy is hard, but somehow, Cleese always manages to make it look easy.\nHe created the 1970s British hit \"Fawlty Towers\":\nHe traded barbs with James Bond:\nAnd he played it straight on \"Will & Grace\":\nCleese: \"I'm going to stick to you like bangers to mash.\"\nMegan Mulally: \"You're not getting your banger anywhere near my mash.\" But this is how he'll likely be remembered:\nCleese is co-founder of the British sketch comedy troupe Monty Python. He co-wrote much of the material, and his athletic 6-foot-5 frame was a gag in itself.\nThere's nothing silly about his walk anymore: A knee injury in 1985 ended all that. But at 75, Cleese is still a rock star. \"He's a legacy for Britain!\" said one fan in passing on London's Regent Street.\nHis fans are keeping the silly walk alive. He says when fans talk to him about their favorite bits, \"it's Monty Python in America. Here, 'Fawlty Towers.'\"\nAnd is there one bit above all? \"People are often on about the Dead Parrot sketch.\"\nThe Dead Parrot sketch is from 1969, but absurdity has a long shelf life: A huge dead parrot turned up in a London park last summer to promote a Python reunion show: it sold out in under a minute.\nMichael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, John Cleese and Terry Jones perform on the closing night of \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\" at the O2 Arena on July 20, 2014 in London. Dave J Hogan/Getty Images\nSmith said, \"You're arguably the most famous of the Python members -\"\n\"Oh, much more famous!\" Cleese replied.\n\"What's your relationship with fame?\"\n\"It's beyond ridiculous.\"\n\"You find it ridiculous?\"\nprev Next 1 / 3", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/23/2d40e811-f9f4-477b-a430-1fbdca2e2313/thumbnail/220x140/ed7fbe47bafae6f054558b0aa72e5ba1/john-cleese-holy-grail-tim-the-enchanter.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4uZRYO8BcL4?start=75", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/09/21/eedb7668-7fb7-4d2a-bdc3-b08ca3b0601f/bda0819706954b12b73d9bd0fdebc14b/monty-python-o2-reunion-getty-620-452438354.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/npjOSLCR2hE?list=PL6FD5A97331C1B802", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ee4OXgS2LU", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mv0onXhyLlE"], "published": "2015-10-25T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:43:43.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
