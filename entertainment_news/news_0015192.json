While “Baby Tattooville” may be taking its final bow, the city’s reputation as an artistic risk-taker will continue to command center stage.\nThe curious title, “Baby Tattooville,” which has nothing to do with infants or ink, has drilled itself into the city’s artistic soul for nearly a decade as an annual must-see event.\nSelf, 49, the show’s originator and producer, said his sister dreamed up the handle 13 years ago after watching his year-old daughter press on temporary tats.\nSelf’s last hurrah, “Baby Tattooville: Fade to Black,” which opened on Thursday, Oct. 1, showcases the expected “lowbrow” mix of disquieting, in-your-face, nostalgic and offbeat works from pioneers of alternative art. After the exhibition closes on Saturday, Jan. 9, Self’s baby will vanish for good.\nIts swan song consists of 25 works– none for sale– by 10 mostly Los Angeles-based artists. They include art rock stars, Mark Ryden and his wife, Marion Peck, whose macabre, quietly creepy works are collected by A-list celebrities. Avant-garde pop star Lady Gaga told the press that Ryden inspired the meat dress she wore several years ago and Katy Perry has tweeted about his imagery.\nOUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM “Bob Self has a specific vision,” said Haupt.\nBy embracing it, the community has helped raise this outsider style to mainstream and instrumental in shifting public opinion, said Patrick Brien, executive director of the Riverside Arts Council.\nA decade ago, the city never would have never sponsored the mural which Riverside street artists Jeff Soto and Maxx242 spray-painted this spring on the outside wall of Pixels Bar, Brien said. “ Now it's a big calling card for us as the City of Arts and Innovation.”\n“Baby Tattooville” has captivated an eclectic audience, some of whom popped into the Riverside Art Museum for the first time in their lives, said museum trustee and longtime arts supporter Sperry MacNaughton.\nSince it landed in the community eight years ago as Self’s love letter to Riverside, “Baby Tattooville” has drawn some of the museum’s biggest and youngest crowds because of the show’s “strange, fun and magnificent” appeal, said Drew Oberjuerge, executive director. “It really put Riverside on the map.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmc4d-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb022.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmc4e-b88524017z.120151002172916000gpac9lqb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmc4d-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb020.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmc4e-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb026.10.jpg", "http://ausgangart.com/", "http://marionpeck.com/", "http://saschristian.com/", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmc4d-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb022.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmc4f-b88524017z.120151002172916000gpac9lqd.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://www.riversideartmuseum.org/", "http://camillerosegarcia.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmc4d-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb024.10.jpg", "http://www.krkland.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmc4e-b88524017z.120151002172916000gpac9lqb.10.jpg", "http://markryden.com/", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmc4d-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb020.10.jpg", "https://www.popaganda.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmc4f-b88524017z.120151002172916000gpac9lqd.10.jpg", "http://www.boskoart.com/", "http://eolivia.com/", "http://isabelsamaras.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmc4d-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb024.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmc4e-b88524017z.120151002172916000g34cb026.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:29:32.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
