I mean, Collective Soul drew a big crowd, which has got to be news for anyone who has bought a record since 1996. \nIn case you couldn't make it to Champions Park, here are the top five things you missed, in no particular order. \n1. On a day where nostalgia ruled, Lynyrd Skynyrd was the big winner. Maybe it was the decision to play nothing but one huge song after another. Maybe it was the animated performance. Either way, it was an immensely satisfying set. \n2. Edmonton County was represented in fine style by Black Stone Cherry and the Kentucky HeadHunters. The HeadHunters' Richard Young had a blast singing the blues in the early afternoon and then his son, John Fred, pushed Black Stone Cherry through a strong set with some truly unhinged drumming a couple of hours later. \n3. Nashville's All Them Witches was a welcome reminder that you can't ignore the small stages. The band delivered an impressive set of progressive garage rock, straddling decades while being firmly in the moment. \n4. Shinedown, a weirdly popular band from Jacksonville, FL, actually suggested that racism, and possibly world hunger, could be cured by covering Skynyrd's \"Simple Man,\" a song which the actual Lynyrd Skynyrd had performed not 20 minutes earlier. Neither happened. \n5. The weather. After a very trying Saturday, which began with a rain delay and then constantly verged on cold and rainy, Sunday was absolutely gorgeous. All festivals should be so lucky.
