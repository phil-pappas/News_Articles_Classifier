People used to laugh at me, but … I believe you should wear your trauma proudly,” she said. \n“My blush is from a sunburn I got as a kid.” \nFlanked by elderly men and women for the gig and interview, the singer, who draws inspiration from French New Wave cinema and Italian directors Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini, has a somewhat unusual approach for video casting. \n“Before I shoot a video, I go to the town, I wander in the streets and everyone I have strong eye (contact) with … I feel they are meant to be in my video,” she said. \nHer creative team also comes from online encounters that turned into productive collaborations. \n“It’s kind of coincidence that I am meeting people online and creating with them. I call it my little empire,” she said. \nMeller’s new single “Barbaric” is released on Nov. 6. \n(Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:32:00.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
