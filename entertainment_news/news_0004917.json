The road and sidewalk were shut down Monday afternoon, village Mayor Frederick May said. They are scheduled to remain closed until Sunday.\nThe village's bustling business district, just south of the closed stretch of road, remains open and can be reached via posted detours.\nUnlike some officials in Pittsford who complained last month they hadn’t been warned that Monroe Avenue in Pittsford village would be closed for the same purpose, Fairport leaders had plenty of notice.\n\"Our people have known this for months. Our merchants have all been told repeatedly that this was going to happen,” May said Tuesday morning.\nThe only confusion was the time of closure. CSX had told village officials their work would begin Oct. 12, and many people assumed that meant first thing in the morning, May said. The road-closed and detour signs went up shortly before 3 p.m.\nThe CSX crossings in Fairport and Churchville, which each have three tracks carrying CSX freights or Amtrak passenger trains, are generally the busiest in Monroe County.\nCSX, which works on both rails and roadway when it rebuilds a crossing, will keep at least one or two tracks open to train traffic at all times during the work. May said he observed an Amtrak train go through the crossing Tuesday morning, though at a greatly reduced speed. Trains normally go through the village at speeds of up to 79 mph, according to federal data.\nMotorists can use Turk Hill Road to the east of the village center or O'Connor Road to the west to make their way around the blockage.\nSORR@DemocratandChronicle.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:18:36.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
