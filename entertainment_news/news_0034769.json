It was pretty cool that we could bring that vibe to the music video too by shooting it back in Macon with a ton of people from my hometown. Getting back there and on that high school football field really reminded me of that rush of just living life without any regrets.”  //sgfnow.co/1RRRf4D MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:24:47.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
