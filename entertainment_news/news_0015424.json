The dreaded word…”physical”.\nAfter every match someone mentions the physicality of the game, the players as well as the teams. Saw a pre-match discussion and apparently the southern hemisphere teams play more physical rugby. Ever heard of Newton’s Third Law…\nFunny, I never knew rugby players did not touch each other a few years ago. Somehow rugby has evolved into a full on contact sport where people TACKLE each other!\nThe Pienaars, Smalls and Van der Westhuizens of old merely ran around a field, throwing and kicking the ball at each other without ever touching each other. That was the real rugby! Then along came touch rugby. The version of the game where you lightly touch another player on their ass and they immediately drop the ball to the ground.\nFundamentalists probably think the end of the world is nigh, because these days rugby players jump at each other’s legs, fall over opponents and bump heads. At times they even gather in small groups of 8 people and literally ram the other team… oh the humanity!\nSo please can someone tell me why rugby is a physical game whereas soccer, ice hockey, field hockey, wrestling etc. are not physical games?\nSex is also physical, wonder how these rugby players’ wives survive!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:31:06.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
