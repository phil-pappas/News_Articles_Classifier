It’s hard to predict as to when and how people would lose their interest in the ubiquitous AlDub. \nPerhaps, the network will exhaust all possible ways for this not to happen. After all, AlDub seems the only reason why the network is so relevant and alive these days. JaDine James Reid and Nadine Lustre \nIndividually, James Reid and Nadine Lustre are doing fine. Together, they are a force to reckon with. JaDine did not just conquer both local TV and music scenes. The sturdy tandem has also penetrated other platforms like mobile apps and social media. On Twitter, JaDine fans post at least 1.5 million tweets each day enough for JaDine to land on trending topics worldwide. And that’s not all, their series On The Wings of Love is one of most watched series on video sharing sites including in ABS-CBN mobile app iWant TV. Heneral Luna John Arcilla as Gen. Antonio Luna \nWho would have thought that this film inspired by the life and death of Gen. Antonio Luna would make waves at the local tills? Heneral Luna’s astronomical success reflects on its domestic gross receipt that now stands at P200 millions as of this writing. And in our recent visit to the movie houses, we were surprised that seats to the screening of the film are still full. Jerrold Tarog has definitely started a new kind of revolution on local cinema. People...are not talking about Manny Pacquiao Manny Pacquiao for Senator \nHorrific as it may sound, but yes, the boxing champ is seriously considering running for a position in the senate in the next year’s elections. Soon, we would be able to say that the Senate Hall had welcomed personalities like Lito Lapid, Bong Revilla and Tito Sotto who twisted their careers from entertaining fans to wooing constituents and yet we can’t even recall anything good that they did for this nation. Your Face Sounds Familiar Your Face Sounds Familiar host Billy Crawford with Melai Cantiveros \nIf you religiously followed the first season, you would definitely see its big difference from the edition currently airing now. Though it still carries the same brand of entertainment it’s noticeable how terrible the makeup done on the celebrity performers. It makes us wonder if the management notices that because if we were in their position we would have fired these makeup artists who make celebrity performers looking not in any way close to what they are supposed to look like. My Faithful Husband My Faithful Husband stars Jennylyn and Dennis \nThere’s no extension for the drama series that centers on cheating partners. The network explains that Jennylyn Mercado is having a tough time keeping up with her erratic and busy schedule. But was it really the real reason? Kibitzers say otherwise. Most stars would die just to have their series extended for a month or so because it’s tantamount to the series being a huge hit in terms of revenue and viewership.
