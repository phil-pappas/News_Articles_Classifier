The last two years of my life have put a different sort of rocket fuel up my backside.” \nWinslet, who also happens to be the love interest of Liam Hemsworth in ‘The Dressmaker,’ mentioned that she said to Jocelyn Moorhouse, the director, that they might get away with this as the 25-year-old actor looks older than he is and she doesn’t feel old. \nRevealing that she could get away with a lot more in her twenties, Winslet admitted “I couldn’t go out now and get rip-roaring drunk; I’d take a week to recover and I value my life too much. Plus, I have children.” \nShe says she’s “baffled” by anyone who doesn’t think women get more beautiful with age, adding that confidence comes with age and looking beautiful comes from the confidence people have in themselves.
