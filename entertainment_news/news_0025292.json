PBS' popular \"Finding Your Roots\" series, temporarily shelved after an episode omitted references to the slaveholding past of Affleck's ancestor at the actor's request, will return to public television for its third season in January 2016. The show has hired a new fact-checker and two new genealogists as part of its reforms, said the network's Beth Hoppe on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015.
