Filming for the fourth series of the drama series is slated to begin next spring.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Cop accused of stealing step-daughter`s inheritance\n0\nPot found at location of deadly Vaughan crash\n0\nTory an abysmal failure at managing city's finances\n0\nToronto Rock cheerleading squad selected\n0\nDrunk driving charges up 17% in GTA: OPP\n0\nKristen Wiig 'bummed' by 'Ghostbusters' backlash\n0\nWhale-watching boat sinks off Tofino, deaths reported\n0\n55 days and counting for Jays GM Anthopoulos\n0\nReese Witherspoon: The world is 'ready' for 'Legally Blonde 3'\n0\nRaptors' Patterson has to play his way back\n0\nTTC Surveillance Footage of Sammy Yatim Shooting\nJays fan gets bat flip tattoo\nGanter, Buffery discuss Marcus Stroman\nBallot with both PC Party and Conservative causes voter confusion and concerns\nFirefighters up to the Challenge\nMore from Celebrities Benedict Cumberbatch forced to call police after being targeted by obsessed fan 0\nGwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale agree to divorce terms 0\nMaureen O'Hara, spirited star of 'Miracle on 34th Street,' 'The Quiet Man,' dies at 95 0\nRihanna's former publicist admits he was behind Jay Z affair rumours 0\nTwo more women come forward with Bill Cosby allegations ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-26T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:00:12.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
