What? Oh, sorry.\nIn the wake of two GOP presidential primary debates that were, courtesy of Donald Trump and the 37 other Republican candidates, huge, crowded-stage ratings grabbers, Tuesday night's Democratic debate on CNN has the potential to be a political snoozefest.\nFirst off, there will be only be five candidates onstage, six if Vice President Joe Biden suddenly throws his gaffe in the ring and arrives at the debate via jet pack. (#Awesome.)\nThe GOP debates have taught us that more is always better, so expect CNN to do something to liven up the broadcast. I recommend projecting a hologram of Trump saying \"Loser!\" every time a candidate speaks, or intermittently releasing wildlife onto the stage and watching how the candidates react.\nAnything would be better than the nonconfrontational blah-blah we've witnessed in the lead-up to this debate.\nFront-runner Hillary Clinton has spent most of her campaign awkwardly fending off attacks over the use of a personal email account during her time as secretary of state, and Bernie Sanders, the unexpected second-place candidate, has been busy answering questions like, \"Are you surprised that people actually like you?\"\nQuizzing the Democratic presidential candidates Dawn M.

We know in advance that candidate Hillary Clinton will be quizzed on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, Bernie Sanders will talk about income inequality, and Martin O’Malley,...\n(Dawn M. Turner) There are a few other candidates who will be on the stage in Las Vegas, but at this point in the column, I haven't figured out who they are. I'll Google them and get back to you after you read these quick previews of what to expect from Clinton and Sanders.\nHillary Clinton:\nLong considered a lock for the nomination, Clinton has been fighting a public perception that she is untrustworthy. That perception evolved in part from the aforementioned private email account, the private server those emails were stored on and the unbelievably untrustworthy way she has gone about discussing the thinking behind her inherently-untrustworthy-sounding email decision.\nThe debate between the candidate and the public has been, in essence:\nPublic: Why did you use a private email server and then delete a bunch of emails?\nClinton: You don't need to worry about that. Trust me.\nPublic: But we're not entirely comforta…\nClinton: I SAID, \"TRUST ME!!\"\nIf the Clinton campaign holds to form, you can expect that the candidate will attempt to re-brand herself at least twice during the debate. She also will be the first presidential candidate in the modern television era to appear on a debate stage with very tiny focus groups balanced on each shoulder. (Calvin Coolidge tried this in the 1920s, but shrink-ray technology was not as reliable at the time.)\nIt is recommended that you watch the debate live, because Clinton campaign officials have reserved the right to delete all or part of the broadcast from the country's DVRs if they see fit.\nBernie Sanders:\nA cross between Vladimir Lenin and wild-haired inventor Emmett \"Doc\" Brown from the movie \"Back to the Future,\" Sanders has defied all odds by hypnotizing throngs of Democratic voters into believing an avowed socialist could become president of the United States.\nSpeaking before enormous crowds of people who were looking to kill time before the local co-op opened, Sanders' populist message resonates with the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Those voters also seem to appreciate his penchant for not sending email on a private server while serving as secretary of state.\nPolling data show that he is favored 5-to-1 over Clinton among Democrats who find winning objectionable. The key for Sanders in the first debate, aside from making sure the snacks in the green room are evenly distributed, will be proving that he is capable of selling out to corporate interests and isn't just an honest pragmatist who values substance over style.\nMartin O'Malley:\nAlso known as \"that other candidate they have,\" O'Malley is a bit like the mythical \"fifth Beatle,\" only not as familiar to people.\nBest known as the former governor of Maryland — state motto: \"We're the small land mass that keeps Washington, D.C., from contaminating the good people of Pennsylvania\" — O'Malley desperately needs this debate to introduce himself to Democrats who might be looking for an alternative to Clinton or Sanders.\nHe implemented stricter gun laws while governor but may still have some crossover appeal to conservative voters because, on a map, Maryland kind of looks like a gun.\nJim…Wagner?…Wellington?…Wellbutrin… …WEBB! That's it! It's Jim Webb:\nA one-term senator from Virginia, Webb is well known among his family and friends, and they are all just super proud of him for running for president.\nLincoln Chafee:\nChafee is a former Republican who was forced to run for president as a Democrat because if the GOP added another candidate, debate stages would have to be the size of Maryland. (And also in the shape of a gun.)\nThose are the only confirmed candidates for this first debate. Biden is considering a run, and CNN — I'm not making this up — has a sixth podium ready in case he decides to show up.\nIt's unclear whether that podium is equipped with a tape deck that would allow Biden to play Bonnie Tyler's \"Holding Out for a Hero.\"\nWe can only hope.\nrhuppke@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Hillary Clinton Republican Party Joe Biden Donald Trump Jim Webb Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c8eb1/turbine/ct-democratic-debate-dawn-turner-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c272f/turbine/ct-democratic-debate-huppke-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:57:58.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
