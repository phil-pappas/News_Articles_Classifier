Each of ProLeader's 30 presets are designed to fit a unique style that stands out from other styles. This means every preset has a specific purpose and it allows users to lead into videos of all kinds. Choose from a variety of styles including minimalistic, retro, vintage, standard, digital, art media, film, analog and many more.\nAdd one or stack multiple overlays on top of ProLeader presets to enhance them with stylizing effects. Add film damage to create vintage, old film looks or add static and some shake to simulate retro, manual, and analog equipment. Utilize tech overlays, flares, and glitch effects to further stylize, or add pencil and chalk effects to create artistic looks.\nUsers can resize, re-position and rotate any of ProLeader's 30 presets using intuitive on-screen controls. Scale in inner rings using the inner radius on-screen control and scale the entire effect by sliding the outer radius control. Colors, replications, widths, textures and more can be manipulated using the controls in the inspector window.\nProLeader was professionally designed to work seamlessly inside of Final Cut Pro X . As a generator effect, each ProLeader preset can be dragged and dropped into the timeline and previewed in real time. Users can then add overlays by finding them in the titles menu and dragging them into the timeline. With the parameters found in the FCPX inspector, users can make further adjustments with a few clicks of the mouse.\nEstablished in 2006, Aliso Viejo, California-based Pixel Film Studios is an innovative developer of visual effects tools for the post-production and broadcast community.
