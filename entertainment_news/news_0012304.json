I know you don't take criticism well, but that's what we all think,\" the English singer said.\nGuy Sebastian also said he was \"baffled\" by the song choices Minogue had made for her final acts. \nA defensive Minogue asked if the comment had been aimed at her, not her artist, when Blunt fired back.\n\"It is. You're the one choosing the song and last time I said this you bit my head off. It's just a thing. I think she's really good. Give her a chance.\"\nSebastian also criticised the songstress.\nMinogue appeared visibly upset after the comments, saying she felt like she was being attacked \"from every angle\". \n\"I have to say I'm baffled so far with your journey in the live shows, I don't understand the song choices,\" he said.\n\"So far to me it's either been too low or too screechy up here. It just saddens me.\"\nAn upset Minogue defended both herself and Georgia as Isaak tried to placate her.\n\"Now I'm baffled. It's coming from every angle,\" she said. \"I am absolutely fine with criticism. I don't bite anyone's head off.\" \nThe tension between Minogue and Blunt reached fever pitch later in the program when Minogue criticised the performance of Blunt's finalist Louise.\n\"Regardless of the reaction in the room, I personally didn't like it,\" Minogue told Louise.\nBlunt retorted by accusing her of being disingenuous.\n\"If that's a genuine response from Dannii then that's a real surprise to me.\" \nAngered by the comment, Minogue defended herself against the accusations when Blunt told her: \"You've had your moment let's move on\".\n\"If it's genuine, which I'm unsure it was, you know that was awesome, good stuff,\" he told his artist.\nX Factor airs Mondays and Tuesdays, 7.30pm on Channel Seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:25:52.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
