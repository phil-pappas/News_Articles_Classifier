Those who were unable to attend the event, however, can now watch the video which was filmed by an attendee and has been shared online. Though it surfaced in low quality, the video manages to offer a glimpse of Jon Bernthal as The Punisher and Elodie Yung as Elektra. It also includes the returning characters, including the Man Without Fear himself ( Charlie Cox ), Claire Temple ( Rosario Dawson ) and Karen Page ( Deborah Ann Woll ). The Netflix/Marvel series has additionally added Stephen Rider as a series regular for season 2. He will play Blake Tower, a District Attorney for New York City who will help Matt Murdock with information to help track down and capture criminals.
