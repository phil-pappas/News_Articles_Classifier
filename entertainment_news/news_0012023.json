Margaret Minnicks God is a holy God. Therefore, we should come into God's presence the way Moses did. Moses was told to take off his shoes because the ground he stood on was holy ground. The taking off of his shoes was an act of humility, reverence and respect. (Exodus 3:4-5)\nWhen Isaiah was in God's presence, he said, \"Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips.\" (Isaiah 6:5) We remember our sins when we come into God's presence. But God is a forgiving God. Confess your sins and God will cleanse you from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)\nIn the presence of God is the fullness of joy. In order to experience the fullness of that joy, we should be willing to come into God's presence and enjoy Him for who He is without requesting His presents , the things He gives us.\nIn the presence of God is the fullness of joy.
