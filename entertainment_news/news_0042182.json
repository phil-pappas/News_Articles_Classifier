Spollen’s work has been the subject of one-man shows at the Staten Island Museum, the Society of Illustrators, and was most recently included in the acclaimed Robot show at the Norman Rockwell Museum. He is also represented in numerous juried group exhibitions.\nMeet and greet Chris Spollen at the Society of Illustrators, 128 East 63rd St. NY, NY on Oct. 24th 1-3. Signed copies of \" The Art of Recycling \" will be available for purchase as well as a few original sculptures to see and touch.\nMeet and greet as well the publisher of Boulevard Books, Avi Gvili, Educator and Author.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13008694.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13008694.htm", "http://www.drawger.com/spollen/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1942500041"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:20:34.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
