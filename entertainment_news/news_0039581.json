Raccoon Road. \nWolaver brings Scripture to life with a dramatic speaking style, delivering her messages while working with clay at a potter’s wheel. \nThe conference will offer solutions for living in a stress-filled world. Classes will include “Holy Yoga,” making natural lip balm and healthy food sampling. Sessions will be offered twice Saturday, in the morning and afternoon, but class sizes are limited, so participants are asked to preregister by calling Penny at 330-519-7709. \nDoors will open at 6 p.m. today and 8 a.m. Saturday. Tickets are $10 for the two-day event at the church office, JMJ Spiritual in Cornersburg and Diamonds in the Rough Cafe, Austintown.
