Weeks after Rupert Wyatt departed the project due to creative differences , Deadline said that the \" Edge of Tomorrow \" and \" The Bourne Identity \" helmer is wanted for the project. TheWrap's Jeff Sneider supported the report when he tweeted on Sunday, October 18 that the film's star and producer Channing Tatum \"has been courting\" Liman. However, there's still no official word if the filmmaker will take the job or not. True that Channing Tatum has been courting Doug Liman to direct GAMBIT. We'll see if he goes for it though... — Jeff Sneider (@TheInSneider) October 18, 2015 Wyatt dropped out of \"Gambit\" last month. He cited scheduling conflict as the reason behind his exit, but it's later reported that he decided to part ways with Fox because the studio didn't accept his creative vision for the movie. The superhero film is due to be released in the U.S. on October 7, 2016 with production scheduled to start in early spring. Tatum is set to star alongside Lea Seydoux and produce with Reid Carolin, Lauren Shuler Donner and Simon Kinberg. \n© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Gambit News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:30:36.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
