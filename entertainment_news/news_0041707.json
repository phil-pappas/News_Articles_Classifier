Unfortunately when it comes to hiring a law firm to advance a mesothelioma compensation claim the victim, or their family are stuck with the lawyers.\n\"Before hiring a law firm to advance a mesothelioma compensation claim in Florida please call us first at 866-714-6466 so you have peace of mind about the quality of the lawyers representing you.\" http://Florida.MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com\nSo why is the Florida Mesothelioma Victims Center so concerned about a diagnosed US Navy Veteran or trades worker in Florida getting the best possible lawyers?\nThe Center says, \"If you hire what we call a Florida billboard personal injury law firm, or a cable TV mesothelioma law firm in all likelihood a person with this rare cancer could lose out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation because they typically do not have enough skill, or experience. If you call us at 866-714-6466 we will make two, or three law firm suggestions, and all of the mesothelioma lawyers we suggest get the nation's top compensation settlements.\" http://Florida.MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com\nImportant Compensation Tip from the Florida Mesothelioma Victims Center: \"We have recently learned some cable TV mesothelioma law firms are charging a diagnosed victim of mesothelioma 45% of the gross settlement amount. That is ridiculous. The going rate is 33% if no trial is involved, and 40% if a trial is involved.\"\nAside from their focus on the best possible compensation the Center is also very passionate about treatment options for mesothelioma. For the best possible mesothelioma treatment options in Florida the Florida Mesothelioma Victims Center strongly recommends the following heath care facility with the offer to help a diagnosed victim, or their family get to the right physicians at this hospital.\nThe H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida: http://moffitt.org/\nThe Florida Mesothelioma Victims Center wants to emphasize there is a statewide initiative available to a diagnosed victim anywhere in Florida including communities such as Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, Saint Petersburg, Orlando, Hialeah, Fort Lauderdale, Tallahassee, Port Saint Lucie, or Cape Coral. http://Florida.MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com\nHigh risk work groups for exposure to asbestos now living in Florida include US Navy Veterans, power plant workers, shipyard workers, oil refinery workers, steel mill workers, miners, manufacturing workers, plumbers, electricians, auto mechanics, machinists or construction workers. Typically the exposure to asbestos occurred in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, or 1980's.\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control, the average age for a diagnosed victim of mesothelioma is 72 years old. Frequently victims of mesothelioma are initially misdiagnosed with pneumonia. This year between 2,500 and 3,000 US citizens will be diagnosed with mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is attributable to exposure to asbestos.\nThe Florida Mesothelioma Victims Center says, \"Before you hire a law firm to advance a mesothelioma compensation claim please call us at 866-714-6466, and compare the qualifications of who we consider to be the nation's most skilled mesothelioma attorneys to any other lawyer, or law firm.\n\"When it comes to obtaining the best mesothelioma compensation settlement, the quality of the attorney matters, as we would like to explain.\" http://Florida.MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com\nFor more information about mesothelioma please refer to the National Institutes of Health's web site related to this rare form of cancer: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mesothelioma.html\n release/florida-mesothelioma-victims-center-is-urging-a-diagnosed-veteran-or-trades-worker-in-florida-to-call-them-to-ensure-they-are-talking-the-nations-top-lawyers-who-get-better-compensation-413425.php", "external_links": ["http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mesothelioma.html", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/florida-mesothelioma-victims-center-is-urging-a-diagnosed-veteran-or-trades-worker-in-florida-to-call-them-to-ensure-they-are-talking-the-nations-top-lawyers-who-get-better-compensation-413425.php", "http://moffitt.org/"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:38:46.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
