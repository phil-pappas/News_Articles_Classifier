Israel says the group, which runs education and religious services for Israeli Arabs, has incited violence by spreading lies about Israel's supposed intentions regarding a sensitive Jerusalem holy site which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews.\nAt his weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu singled out an Arab lawmaker, Hanin Zoabi , who the premier said called on hundreds of thousands of worshippers to ascend to the site to prevent an \"Israeli plot of bloodletting of east Jerusalem residents.\"\nNetanyahu says that amounts to clear incitement to violence and has asked the attorney general to open a criminal investigation against Zoabi.\n___\n8:30 a.m.\nIsraeli police say a Palestinian woman has set off a small explosive in her vehicle in the West Bank, lightly wounding a police officer and critically wounding herself.\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says the police officer noticed the woman driving suspiciously Sunday morning and motioned her to stop. She then chanted \"God in great\" and detonated the explosive.\nThe attack marks the first use of explosives in the current round of violence that has mostly been confined to stabbing and shooting attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem, the West Bank and elsewhere.\nPalestinians carried out two stabbing attacks in Jerusalem on Saturday before being shot dead by police, while another two Palestinians were killed near the border fence with the Gaza Strip, as a weeklong bout of violence showed no signs of slowing.\n___\n8:00 a.m.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry says a pregnant woman and her 2-year-old daughter have been killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nMinistry spokesman Ashraf Al-Kidra identified the mother as 30-year-old Noor Hassan . He said four others were wounded, included Hassan's husband and son, in the strike in the southern Gaza strip.\nThe Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas weapons manufacturing facilities in response to earlier rocket fire toward Israel.\nThe Gaza border has been largely calm since the monthlong Summer 2014 war between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules the coastal territory.\nBut after a week of violence across Israel and the West Bank, protests spread to Gaza as well in recent days. Nine Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces along the border area.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:06:26.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
