Walker/Getty Images)) 0   \nOne of the many untapped stories in the \"One Piece\" series is that of the background and family of White Beard Pirates Captain Edward Newgate. \nAccording to Movie News Guide , Chapter 803 will delve into the identity of Miss Bucking. It will also explore if she and Weeble are actually the wife and son of Captain Newgate. Like Us on Facebook \nThe word around the Internet seems to be favoring the thought that Miss Bucking and Weeble are not related to Newgate, even though Weeble has been proclaiming that he is indeed the son of the legendary pirate. Fans of the show instead are thinking that Miss Bucking is actually after the Newgate treasure, while Weeble is under some kind of mind control power possessed by the female pirate. \nMany netizens are also stating that the duo is inspired by another infamous twosome from another anime. According to Christian Today , the characters of Miss Bucking and Weeble have been inspired by \"Dragon Ball Z\" pair Babdi and Majin Buu. Those not familiar could picture Babdi as a short elderly character who has a strange control over the more powerful child-like Majin Buu. The similarities end there, however, as the exact powers of Miss Bucking and Weeble are yet to be revealed. \nIt appears that Miss Bucking did attempt to have a relationship with Captain Newgate, and her love for the captain was unrequited. The relationship turned her into a bitter woman who is not interested in the vast wealth of the former captain, but instead is out for revenge on the surviving crew members. How this will affect Luffy and the Straw Hats is yet to be seen. \nThe next chapter of \"One Piece\" will also showcase a new island that the Straw Hat Pirates have discovered. The island's name will be Zuo, and it has been revealed that the island is actually a giant elephant which proves to be difficult to land on as Zuo not only has a thick fog protecting it but it is also actually in constant motion. Luffy and his crew will be dealing with the difficulty of docking on Zuo as well as dealing with the local Mink tribes which inhabit the island. \nWhat are your thoughts on the next adventure of the Straw Hat Pirates? Do you think Luffy and his crew are closer to getting to the One Piece? Let us know in the comments below.
