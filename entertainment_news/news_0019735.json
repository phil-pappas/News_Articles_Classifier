But as far as tourists are concerned, the T-rexes have lost their bite, prompting scientists to cook up a new breed of creature called Indominus Rex. Cue the chaos! There are endangered kids on the loose, a villain (Vincent D'Onofrio) who wants to turn velociraptors into weapons and a hero (Chris Pratt) tasked with battling back the beasties. Like many modern directors, Colin Trevorrow mistakes mania for well-staged action. But Pratt's easy-does-it heroics and the jaw-dropping special effects will knock you out. Extras: deleted scenes and featurettes.\nZ FOR ZACHARIAH (2015, Lionsgate, PG-13, $20) — Here's the rare post-apocalyptic thriller that focuses less on special effects and more on the tense relationship between three survivors. In the wake of a nuclear attack, Ann (Margot Robbie) thinks she's the last person on earth. But soon she's joined on her isolated farm by an ailing research scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and a coal miner (Chris Pine), both of whom add jolts of suspense to the proceedings. As the trio debates faith, rebuilding and the laws of attraction, \"Z\" is never less than transporting. Extras: featurettes and deleted scenes.\nBuy this photo Available ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL (2015, Fox, PG-13, $30) — A very funny movie about a serious subject, this dramedy stars Thomas Mann as Greg, a commitment-phobic high schooler whose mom (Connie Britton) pressures him to spend time with a neighbor (Olivia Cooke) recently diagnosed with cancer. As Greg and Rachel discover how much they have in common, he begins to understand the power of friendship. While it winds up feeling a bit too pat, Greg is a refreshingly complicated character whose movie parodies — \"A Sockwork Orange\" anyone? — are priceless treats. Extras: deleted scenes, featurettes and commentary by director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon.\nCALL ME LUCKY (2015, MPI, unrated, $25) — From director Bobcat Goldthwait (\"God Bless America\") comes an uneven but fascinating documentary about influential comic Barry Crimmins. The film begins as a traditional celebration of Crimmins, who during the '80s and '90s used the stand-up stage to skewer Reagan, Kissinger and the Catholic Church. But, about halfway through, \"Lucky\" takes a turn and delves into Crimmins' childhood rape at the hands of a baby sitter. After opening up about the abuse, the comic began a crusade to crack down on pedophiles. \"Lucky\" is overlong but illuminating. Extras: commentary by Crimmins and Goldthwait. \nBuy this photo THE FALLING (2015, Cinedigm, unrated, $20) — Carol Morley's fever dream of a thriller unfolds at an English boarding school so repressed that teachers (Greta Scacchi) scold their students for reading Wordsworth with too much emphasis. One semester, after a tragedy befalls a teenager named Abbie (Florence Pugh), a mysterious fainting epidemic breaks out, causing students to swoon without warning. Seemingly behind the outbreak is a young woman (Maisie Williams of \"Game of Thrones\") on the edge of a sexual awakening. Even though \"The Falling\" is flimsy on motivation, the mood is sinister, and Tracey Thorn's insinuating soundtrack gets under your skin. Extras: none.\nDOPE (2015, Universal, R, $30) — Before it becomes too concerned with a drug-dealing subplot, Rick Famuyiwa's fourth feature busts some cool moves by unreeling the story of Inglewood, Calif., teenager Malcolm (Shameik Moore) and his pals Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons). When \"Dope\" deals with the high schoolers' everyday struggles, it feels funny and fresh. But after Malcolm accidentally comes into possession of a big bag of ecstasy, the movie takes a turn for the clichéd. Still, \"Dope\" boasts some funny, incisive scenes as well as a vibrant soundtrack made up of classic hip-hop tunes from the '90s. Extras: featurettes.\nBuy this photo WE ARE STILL HERE (2015, MPI, unrated, $22) — Ted Geoghegan's retro-horror thriller sends a middle-aged couple (Barbara Crampton, Andrew Sensenig) to an isolated farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and gives them plenty of things to worry about, including charred ghosts and violent townsfolk. From the very first shots of wintry roads and snow-covered fields, it's clear that Geoghegan knows how to capture the beauty and eeriness of his upstate New York locations. At its best, \"We Are Still Here\" offers creepy showdowns, offbeat humor and enough splatter to make Dario Argento smile. Extras: Geoghegan commentary and featurette.\nBRAM STOKER'S DRACULA: SUPREME CINEMA SERIES (1992, Sony, R, $39) — Newly remastered for its latest Blu-ray bow, Francis Ford Coppola's take on literature's most famous Transylvanian prince is rich, frenzied and very adult. As played with panache by Gary Oldman, Drac is a symbol of outlaw sexuality, a monster at once frightening and weirdly romantic. Shot entirely on Hollywood sound stages, \"Dracula\" prefers green mists, startling superimpositions and painted backdrops to digital effects. The result is a movie that has the quaint, magical, done-with-mirrors charm of a 1930s production. \"Dracula\" is a feast for the eyes and the emotions. Extras: commentaries, deleted scenes and featurettes including new Coppola interview.\nCONFESSION (1937, Warner Archive, unrated, $20) — Before Bette Davis snatched away the crown, Kay Francis was the Queen of the Warner Bros. lot. With entertaining dramas like this one, it's easy to see why she reigned supreme for so long. Francis is at her best in this guilty-pleasure sudser about a down-on-her-luck opera singer who shoots a womanizing scoundrel (Basil Rathbone) and then must stand trial for murder. But why did she pull the trigger? Directed with great flourish by German émigré Joe May, this delicious concoction is part love story, part courtroom thriller and part \"Stella Dallas\"-style melodrama. Extras: none.\nA MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY (1982, Twilight Time, PG, $30) — New to Blu-ray, Woody Allen's triffle of a tribute to Ingmar Bergman's 1955 classic \"Smiles of a Summer Night\" is arguably the best-looking film on his résumé. Shot in and around a magical upstate New York country house, the action pivots on three couples at the turn of the century who mischievously long to change partners over the course of a long weekend. It's not classic Woody, but luminous leading ladies Mary Steenburgen, Mia Farrow and Julie Hagerty deliver plenty of laughs. Extras: none.\nTHE SINGING DETECTIVE (2003, Olive, R, $25) — Based on Dennis Potter's 1986 miniseries, this over-stuffed fantasia — now on Blu-ray — centers on a pulp fiction writer (Robert Downey Jr.) suffering from a severe skin disease. As he recovers in his hospital bed, he drifts in and out of consciousness, imagining visits from characters he's created as well as figures (Robin Wright, Adrien Brody) from his past. Almost nothing works. The hospital scenes between a bitter, sputtering Downey and his psychiatrist (uncredited Mel Gibson) feel forced, and the dream sequences are so jumbled together that they never make a lick of sense. Extras: none. \nBACK TO THE FUTURE: THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES (1985-1990, Universal, PG-13, $40) — Before the video games, animated series, theme park rides and musical (still to come), there was Robert Zemeckis' wildly enjoyable time-travel comedy. For the 30th anniversary, Universal is packaging together all three films with the entire run of the TV series. The original movie is still the main attraction, as '80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) zooms back to 1955 to invent rock-and-roll and play matchmaker for his folks (Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover). Extras: shorts, featurettes, commentaries, music videos and deleted scenes.\nNURSE JACKIE: SEASON SEVEN (2015, Lionsgate, unrated, $30) — It's the final season for this stinging Showtime series, and the opiate-addicted Jackie Peyton (Edie Falco) is working hard to kick her habit. After a short stint in jail, Jackie winds up back at All Saints, where she's stripped of her nurse's license and forced to work as a janitor. The most touching subplot involves Zoey (Merritt Wever), who's learned the hard way how dangerous it is to trust Jackie. In one of the best episodes, the pair wind up taking a road trip to Pennsylvania, where they hash out their complicated feelings for each other. Great series finale, too. Extras: featurettes, gag reel and commentaries. \nJANE THE VIRGIN: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON (2015, Warner, unrated, $50) — Rarely has a series with such a wild premise worked so wonderfully well. Based on a Venezuelan telenovela, \"Jane\" follows the adventures of a 23-year-old virgin (Gina Rodriguez) who winds up artificially inseminated with the sperm of her former crush and current boss. It's a funny, fresh and occasionally bittersweet look at love, family and the ties that bind. Extras: deleted scenes, gag reel and featurette.\n— Amy Longsdorf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:29:30.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
