Not something I ever thought I would say tbh. #strictly— James Brown (@Horrorhiker) October 4, 2015 If I had moments left to live I don't know if I would kiss my kids goodbye or spend it beating #Strictly judges in to 4 bloody corpses.— Cal Hal (@calwhisky) October 4, 2015 'The man … The woman … The woman … The man … The woman' - my wife telling me which of the dance partners in #Strictly is the famous one.— Damien Owens (@OwensDamien) October 4, 2015 Here's what everyone thought about the result:Iwan didn't get past the first *hurdle*...sorry #strictly #scd— Caz (@KookeCaz) October 4, 2015 Ola out first week. Not happy. Not worth watching now. #Strictly— Rob Douglas (@Douglas517Rob) October 4, 2015 Such a shame for @The_OlaJordan & @Iwanrunner I think given the chance to train more he would have improved massively & done well #Strictly— Caroline Watt (@CandyPRCaroline) October 4, 2015 That's a shame , I think there are worse dancers there than Iwan #Strictly— Geraldine (@Girlidene) October 4, 2015 The right person definitely went #Strictly— Natalie Lovett (@nattie1985) October 4, 2015Of course it's the right result. Poor Iwan didn't seem to realise he's a terrible dancer. #Strictly— Collymac (@collymac) October 4, 2015 Someone should tell him if a woman says \"don't pick me up and fling me around\", don't pick them up and fling them around. #Strictly— Sebastian Matthews (@AceFlibble) October 4, 2015 Right decision there. At least Ola'll be able to take her time over her Xmas shopping now. #scd #strictly— Richard K Hornsey (@richardkhornsey) October 4, 2015Strictly Come Dancing airs next weekend on Saturday, October 10 at 6.20pm and Sunday, October 11 at 7.15pm on BBC One with a Movie Week special.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:11:02.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
