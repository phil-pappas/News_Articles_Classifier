(LONDON) -- Fans can finally find out what happened when Harry Potter grew up. J.K. Rowling announced on her website Friday that she's set to introduce to fans an adult Harry in a sequel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child . But instead of another book, the story will come in the form of a two-part play. \nSo what can fans expect in the eighth installment of the series? Rowling wrote, \"It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.\" \n\"While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted,\" she continues. \"As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\" \nThe stage play -- written by Jack Thorne and directed John Tiffany -- opens at London's Palace Theatre July 30. It will run in two parts; and fans can either see both parts on one day or both parts on separate days. Tickets go on sale Wednesday via harrypottertheplay.com . \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
