Kerala State awards for non-film music will become a reality in 2015-2016 following Culture Minister K.C. Joseph’s specific instructions to Culture Secretary Rani George. It was on Gandhi Jayanti at the refurbished Tagore theatre, the venue of a world music programme put together by violinist Manoj George, that Chief Minister Oommen Chandy announced his government’s readiness to institute these awards to give a boost to independent music. The follow-up note from Mr Joseph shows the Government’s resolve to make it happen this year and Kerala may perhaps be the first State to institute such awards. Violinist and composer Manoj George, associated with the Grammy award-winning album, Winds of Samsara, had mooted the idea at a meeting with Mr Chandy. Manoj impressed on him the need for a boost to musicians who toil all their lives but go unrewarded. Convinced, Mr Chandy asked him to submit a detailed proposal. Manoj suggested that the government give awards for individuals, including best male and female singer, composer and instrumentalist. He also wanted awards for original songs that would be shared by the singer, lyricist and composer as also for albums of different genres such as pop, rock, folk, fusion, Hindustani and Carnatic.
