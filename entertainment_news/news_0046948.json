Isabella tied the knot with Max Parker, a British IT consultant, in a romantic ceremony at The Dorchester Hotel in Central London on September 18. The magazine included some photos from the ceremony but there were no photos of Bella's brother Connor and mother Nicole Kidman . According to the mag, Bella kept her guest list limited to a small group of close friends as she afraid of the press that her father may draw. While Bella is a member of the Church of Scientology and still attends services regularly, her husband is reportedly a non-scientologist and has not even met Tom. Nicole, meanwhile, was allegedly \"overjoyed\" at her daughter's new union. In the cover photo, Bella is seen posing alongside her bridesmaids. The 22-year-old woman wears a white mini dress and a veil while her bridesmaids don matching nude jumpsuits. Posted by Woman's Day on� Sunday, October 4, 2015 Tom and Nicole adopted Bella and Connor during their marriage. In an interview with DuJour Magazine, Nicole said she stayed in touch with her adopted children via texts despite rumors that the Church of Scientology turned them against her. \"What's your relationship with the Internet and technology? I have four children, so to stay in touch with them it's very important,\" she shared. \"I'm definitely engaged in it but I don't let it rule my life.\" \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:00:50.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
