PUBLISHED: 16:16, Fri, Oct 16, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:56, Fri, Oct 16, 2015 EA STAR WARS Star Wars Battlefront's Walker Assault is set for an update \nThe Star Wars Battlefront beta gave fans their first taste of what is to come, with EA and DICE following it up with a new Q&A session with fans. \nIn many ways the recent server test on Xbox One, PS4 and PC, which included 9m players participating, raised more questions than it answered. \nHowever, some of them have now been put to bed, although only a selection have been tackled by the development team at this time. EA STAR WARS Battlefront fans have been asking questions on the upcoming release \nFirst some good news for fans hoping for the return of Heroes vs. Villains mode: \"Yes, we will offer both a Heroes vs. Villains mode and a Hero Hunt mode in our Multiplayer modes and you can play Hero Battles in our Missions offerings,\" the EA post confirmed. \nThe imbalances players flagged in Walker Assault mode were also covered, with EA revealing that updates would be made to the game but that some of those problems were exclusively connected to the beta due to locked content. \n\"This is a known issue within the Beta and is also a side effect of having weapons and Star Cards locked and not available within the Beta build,\" the online Q&A added. \n\"The balance within the final game will be addressed.\" EA STAR WARS Star Wars Battlefront is set for release in November \nA roundup of other Star Wars Battlefront questions asked by fans can be found below and includes a wide range of topics, including online gameplay, split-screen limitations, Ewoks and AI Bots. \nQ. Are you planning to add Ewoks to the Endor map. Its was very funny to play as Ewok on Battlefront 2. \nA. Ewoks are 100% on Endor, but they are not playable characters. \nQ. When AI Bots and co-op functionality was announced for Star Wars Battlefront, I assumed this would stretch beyond the 'Spec Ops style' Survival Missions. However, there is no mention of playing offline Multiplayer modes with AI bots in the beta. \nA. You will not be able to play the Multiplayer modes offline. However, you will be able to play our Mission Modes (Training, Survival, Battles and Hero Battles) offline. These modes can also be played in co-op in both split-screen (PS4 & X1) and online co-op with 1 additional friend. These modes also allow gameplay with AI. \nQ. So there is no server browser, can I join a group of 5 or 6 friends and we all join the same server? Will we each go to our separate servers because we have different skill levels? \nA. At launch you will be able to join up with seven of your friends to make a full party of eight players. You will all be able to join the same game and play with each other. Skill level will be measured as a whole with a party of eight. \nQ. Split-screen features (the full game, not the beta) Is that just for offline co-op mode, or is it also for online co-op and for competitive (versus) multiplayer? \nA. Split-screen will only be available within our Star Wars Battlefront Mission modes and will allow you and one other friend to play with each other.
