The photo is from Kourtney's latest photo shoot with photographer Brian Bowen Smith for Vanity Fair Magazine. He captioned it, \"Now that's 1 hot mama.\" Despite Kourtney's break-up from Scott and recent photos showing he partying all day all night with a 18-year-old model named Lindsay Vrckovnik, the \" Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" star is still following her ex on social media. According to HollywoodLife , Kourtney was still \"weirdly obsessed\" with the father of her three children and wouldn't unfollow him on Instagram. \"Kourtney is disgusted by Scott and is adamant that she's never taking him back but she's still weirdly obsessed with him,\" a source told the site. \"She googles him all the time and she refuses to unfollow him on Instagram.\" \"Her sisters don't understand why she won't unfollow him because he's always posting pictures that upset her. Kourtney's excuse is that she needs to keep an eye on him for the sake of the kids but it's a pretty flimsy reason. Her friends have told her she should cut off all social media contact but she hasn't been able to do it yet, it's like a sick addiction.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:01:15.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
