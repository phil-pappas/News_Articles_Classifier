There’ll be the X-Box Sports Expo on Sunday and at lunchtime on both days there’s a chance to have a chat with local councillors, who are cooking up a free sausage sizzle.\" \nLesley says as word gets around the community about the Centre she is finding that people are \"buzzing\" about being able to do a lot of things at the one stop. \n\"Bookings are already coming in, with the fitness suite and its state-of-the-art gym equipment proving to be a big attraction. As well as the great sports facilities there are meeting spaces available for community groups, there’s the library, a café, and another big draw is the free Wi-Fi.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
