Abso-freaking-lutely. Everybody would think very differently about what it means to be a living thing in the cosmos.\"\nHe then went on to blow everyone's minds by explaining an alternate theory of the origins of human life, where microbes on mars rocks that made their way to a then-lifeless Earth were the source of all the life on this planet.
