She says she is not as politically correct as you are. \nShe is absolutely right about that. I am politically correct because I want to be like that. \n\nWho has a better sense of humour? \nI would say, she does. I have a different sense of humour; it’s more Punjabi humour. She is blunt. \n\nYou have done several comedy films. Does she enjoy that kind of comedy? \nWell it all depends. She likes humour in certain movies and not in others, because it’s not her kind of humour. She also enjoys slapstick. \n\nYou said that you will play a father when your son starts acting. Is he showing any inclination towards acting? \nNo. He is showing interest in drawing. \n\nJohn Abraham is part of the sequels of many of your films (Welcome Back, Hera Pheri 3). What do you think of his work? \nI think he is doing a good job. \nWhat do you think of Salman Khan enacting action sequences in his next film, Sooraj Barjatya’s Prem Ratan Dhan Payo? \nWho said Sooraj Barjatya cannot make action films? Have a look at his work; he is such a brilliant director. It is good on Sooraj’s part to include action in his next film, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. The film will prove that even Sooraj Barjatya can make action films. The action sequences in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo are designed by Greg Powell with whom I have worked in Holiday. I can vouch for the fact that he is outstanding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:46:57.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
