Every day is a struggle to make the right decisions, and no two days are the same. It doesn’t help either that there are outside factors pulling us in different directions and complicating our decision-making process, like, determining if your child is ready for a cell phone.\nHow do you know when the timing is right? How young is too young?\nWhile age may be a contributing factor to making that decision, experts at the Pew Research Center believe there are other components to consider first, including ease of communication between parent and child, the maturity level of the child and proper cell phone protocol.\nPoll: What is the appropriate age to get your child a smartphone?\n#1. Ease of communicating with your child. Cell phones provide you a chance to know where your child is at all times. If they are walking home from school or participating in after-school activities, a smartphone is an easy means of reaching them for rides or in the event a situation occurs. If there are responsible adults around them at all times, perhaps that’s a reason to hold off a little longer.\n#2. Is my child mature enough? Cell phones are a big responsibility. They are a great way to stay connected but they can be a huge distraction at school. Phones are also easy to misplace, so it’s important ground rules are set in place in the event they’re caught using their phones at an inappropriate time or they lose the device altogether.\n#3. Proper use of the phone. National Centers for Missing and Exploited Children has some great tips on cell phone safety. It’s recommended that you sit down with your child, and discuss if the timing is right.\nEstablish rules right away. Set limits on when they can use the phone and how they can use it. Use guidelines for downloading apps and games, if a smart phone is being considered. Review cell phone bills to check for misuse and time management. It helps to become familiar with the phone numbers, as well, to further protect your child. Explain that once they hit the send button on a message or picture that the information they’ve sent is no longer their own. It can easily be shared with anyone, for better or worse. Note the importance of keeping cell phone numbers and passwords private. They should never be shared online or with strangers. Discuss the importance of being respectful with their phone. Determine consequences if they are sharing text messages or images that would be deemed inappropriate. Encourage them to share with you if they are on the receiving end of these things. Ask about security features for each device to determine which one is the best fit for your family when you shop for a phone. Once you say 'Yes'\nIf you’ve decided to move forward and purchase the phone, be sure that the line of communication remains open with your child. They may know the proper etiquette, but that only safeguards them from so much. You’ll need to discuss how much access you have to their phone, as that provides another layer of safety.\nDiscuss passwords and whether or not you’ll have access to them. If you have a smart phone yourself, you can adjust the settings on your phone to download every app that your child puts on their phone, giving you another layer of protection.\nYour child's safety is critical (of course) and the technology continues to evolve. The more YOU know, the better you can protect your child.\nFor more information on online safety, visit www.netsmartz.org .\nJamie Buss is a freelance writer in the Rochester area.", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9123276/", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9123276.js", "http://poll.fm/5fjkc", "http://www.netsmartz.org/"], "published": "2015-10-12T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:14:08.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
