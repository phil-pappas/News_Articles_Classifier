Male rape \nMale rape has been tackled twice in Hollyoaks. \nIn 2000, Luke Morgan, played by Gary Lucy, was attacked by a fellow football player. \nHis rape was a soap first and generated national headlines. You could argue it's still Hollyoaks' most famous storyline. \nAt the time, producers worked with rape support groups. \nIt was something they did again in 2014 when John Paul McQueen (played by James Sutton) was sexually assaulted by one of his students. 2. Hannah Ashworth's anorexia \nEmma Rigby won a British Soap Award for best actress for her portrayal of Hannah Ashworth, who suffered from anorexia and bulimia. \nHer character battled the illness for years on screen, attracting praise from mental health charities for raising awareness. \nAs part of her plotline, one of her friends, Melissa, died of a heart attack due to a lack of food. \nIt was the first time a British soap had ever had a character die because of an eating disorder. 3. Rhys and Beth's incest \nRhys, played by Andrew Moss, began a relationship with Beth Clement (Sinead Moynihan) after he ran her over. Literally love in the headlights. \nThey took their relationship slowly at first but after attending a family funeral, a long lost relative tells them they were actually half-brother and sister. \nAt first they were shocked by the incest but continued their affair. \nIn the end, Rhys' best mate Gilly found out and exposed it. 4. Ste and Brendan's abusive relationship Image caption Brendan (Emmett Scanlan) and Ste's (Kieron Richardson) relationship was abusive and bittersweet \nOne of the most intriguing relationships was that of Ste Hay (played by Keiron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett Scanlan). \nThe pair were part of a love triangle in which Brendan abused Ste, fuelled by his struggle to accept his sexuality. \nBefore the plot developed, Richardson came out publicly on This Morning. \nHe said: \"The storyline's relevant to some situations in my life and if maybe I can help people that are going through the same thing then it's a bonus.\" \nThe plot was also used to highlight the issue of male victims of domestic abuse. 5. Lisa Hunter's self-harm Image caption Lisa Hunter (Gemma Atkinson) started self-harming at school \nIn the early 2000s, Gemma Atkinson played Lisa Hunter who turned to self-harm after being bullied by Steph Dean. \nIt was the first soap to feature such a plot, with Lisa hiding her self-harm from her family and friends. \nSelf-harm has since been covered several times in Hollyoaks itself, as well as male self-harm in Emmerdale. 6. Natasha Anderson's ecstasy death Image caption Natasha Anderson (far left, played by Shebah Ronay) was one of Hollyoaks' original cast members \nIn 1995, the national press covered the death of a teenage girl called Leah Betts, who died after taking an ecstasy tablet at her 18th birthday. \nLess than a year later, Hollyoaks addressed its own drugs issue when the character of Natasha Anderson, played by Shebah Ronay, had her drink spiked at an 18th birthday. \nShe collapsed and died on the dance floor. \nEver since, Hollyoaks plotlines have echoed real life stories. \nIn 2009, a controversial storyline had two characters who were living under false names after being convicted of killing a child when they were younger. \nIt was thought to be too similar to the murder of James Bulger and was subsequently scrapped. 7. The Hollyoaks massacre Image caption A bomb ripped through the Hollyoaks village council flats \nEvery now and then, soaps decide to have a cull of their casts. \nIn 2013, to celebrate its 18th birthday, Hollyoaks killed off SEVEN characters. \nCentral to the massacre was a bomb blast at the leaving do of Ste Hay and Doug Carter (PJ Brennan). \nDoug died of his injuries before the paramedics had a chance to turn up, leaving Ste devastated. \nOther characters to be killed off included Leanne Holiday, Clare Devine and Ash Kane. 8. Anita Roy's skin bleaching \nIn 2009, Anita Roy, played by Saira Choudhry, was racially abused by Gaz Bennett. \nAs a result of the bullying, she started bleaching her skin to look white - the first soap to ever tackle such a storyline. \nSpeaking to Newsbeat at the time, Choudhry said: \"This is really challenging and the deepest thing I've ever read.\" 9. Jason and Jasmine Costello \nHollyoaks was the first British soap to introduce a character who experiences gender identity disorder. \nIntroduced to the audience as Jasmine Costello, the character was presented as Jason, a boy trapped inside a girl's body. \nThe role was played by Victoria Atkin, who met transgender teenagers to research the character. 10. Steph Cunningham's cancer Image caption Steph Cunningham (played by Carley Stenson) was one of Hollyoaks' longest-running character \nIn 2010, Steph Cunningham was diagnosed with cervical cancer. \nIt mirrored the death of Big Brother's Jade Goody, who had died from the disease the year before. \nOn screen Steph, Carley Stenson, had ignored her symptoms and ended up needing a hysterectomy. \nAs with many other plotlines, producers - and Stenson - hoped to raise awareness of the issue among its audience. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:53:19.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
