It keeps the connections between our countries very much alive currently and for the future\".\nThe Taoiseach has already been in contact with the US Ambassador, Kevin O’Malley, regarding the issue and has said he'll do so again.\nHopefully those talks go well, or else there's going to be a couple more thousands Irish students looking for work back home during the summers. From our own experience, it was tough enough to find any work even with them all gone, so get on it Enda.\nVia The Journal\nMORE: Donald Trump wants to ban J1 visas if he gets elected president\nMORE: Pics: The U.S. got their first Penneys today and the queues were massive\nMORE: Christian themed assault rifles are now a thing, thanks America", "external_links": ["http://www.thejournal.ie/j1-visa-enda-kenny-2372478-Oct2015/"], "published": "2015-10-07T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:35:05.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
