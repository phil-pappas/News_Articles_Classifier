Responding to complaints by some concertgoers who had their accounts suspended or deleted after uploading performances from her \"Unbreakable\" tour, the diva said she's \"listening\" and had instructed her team to make some changes that would allow fans to \"keep posting.\" \"I love and appreciate my fans. I want you to know that I enjoy watching the short video clips of how you are Burning It Up at the Unbreakable shows,\" she opened her lengthy statement shared on Wednesday, October 21 via TwitLonger. \"Please keep posting them.\" She continued to explain why she and her team were initially very strict about every fan-filmed concert video that went online. \"My team is passionate about protecting the intellectual property we are creating for the tour and possible future projects. It was never their intention, acting on my behalf, to have social media accounts removed,\" she said. However, she's still going to take down concert videos that she deems too long. \"Permitting the use of long clips does present a contractual problem for these projects,\" she added. \"I hope you understand. I trust the fans will use their short recordings for their own memories and to share on their social media networks of choice.\" \"I have asked my team to change their approach and allow you to engage socially with these videos,\" she concluded the statement. \"I know I wouldn't be here without the love I stand on.\" Instagram has also responded to the concert video removals. \"When we receive a valid report of intellectual property infringement, we're legally required to remove the reported content and to disable the accounts of repeat infringers,\" the company said. Regarding some account suspensions or deletions in Jackson's case, the social media platform said it was caused by a bug in their system. \"We're legally required to remove the reported content and to disable the accounts of repeat infringers. However, in this instance, we have identified a bug that resulted in the removal of accounts that shouldn't have been removed,\" they explained. \"We have fixed the bug and are in the process of restoring the impacted accounts.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:28.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
