And somebody approached me and asked me to be in a play,\" Reedus told host Jimmy Fallon. \nNow don't get too excited: He was only cast as an understudy. But Reedus said he ended up going on opening night because the actor didn't show up. \nFlash forward more than a decade, and Reedus is now starring as the big, bad zombie hunter Daryl Dixon on AMC's \"The Walking Dead.\" \nThe show is so popular, 15.8 million people tuned in for its fifth season finale back in March. (Video via AMC / \"The Walking Dead\" ) \nSo while drunkenly yelling at people never seems like a sound decision, we'll let it slide this time. \nThis video includes Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:32:56.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
