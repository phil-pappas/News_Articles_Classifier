(AP) — Actor Randy Quaid is expected to be arraigned Monday in Vermont on a charge of being a fugitive from justice after police say he was taken into custody while trying to cross into the country from Canada.\nThe Independence Day actor was detained by troopers at the Highgate Springs port of entry days after Canadian officials said he would be deported. Quaid is wanted in Santa Barbara, Calif., to face felony vandalism charges filed in 2010 after he and his wife, Evi, were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned.\nThe pair skipped several court appearances and went to Canada, where Evi Quaid was granted citizenship. Randy Quaid’s bid to gain permanent residency was denied.\nUSA TODAY\nRandy Quaid facing deportation from Canada\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LnM77k TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800736009406024-AP-ADDITION-Canada-Randy-Quaid-Detained.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4548666751001_thumb-Wochit92340234.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4548666751001_thumb-Wochit92340234.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LnM77k&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LnM77k", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LnM77k&text=Randy%20Quaid%20detained%20in%20Vermont%20trying%20to%20cross%20border&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30d078477e2619bda9371aa3fe6088d8945c3335/r=500x339/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800736009406024-AP-ADDITION-Canada-Randy-Quaid-Detained.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0ad462d664ca5881fa224333877bdb52eb7612df/c=18-0-3785-2832&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800736009406024-AP-ADDITION-Canada-Randy-Quaid-Detained.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67b93b88b5798a8825ab3f748265b9477a6a52e8/c=274-0-1902-1628/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799341923561519-AP-Canada-Randy-Quaid-Detained.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RAamjD", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4548666751001_thumb-Wochit92340234.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:52:36.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
