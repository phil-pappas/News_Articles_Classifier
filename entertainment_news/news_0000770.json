Just because it's not plastered everywhere doesn't mean I didn't have my rock bottom. I've had my moments, and it's almost unsafe for me to even talk about them, because I'll be taken advantage of.\" \nAfter releasing her first solo record, \"Star Dance,\" Gomez -- who's now starring in \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" -- called off the end of her tour, saying she needed to \"spend some time on myself,\" according to E! News. Not long after, she checked herself into the Arizona rehab center The Meadows. Selena Gomez attends the Louis Vuitton Series 3 VIP Launch on September 20, 2015 in London.

I could've had a stroke.\" \nPeople speculated the break was either about chemical abuse or her then on-again, off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber. \nI'd still like to blame him ... just in case. \n\"I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're (expletives).' But I was angry I even felt the need to say that. It's awful walking into a restaurant and having the whole room look at you, knowing what they're saying. I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\" \nI think they were saying, \"What is that nice girl doing with a schmuck like Justin Bieber?\" Advertisement \nGomez said her lupus is in remission, and she's staying on top of it with \"diet, routine and medication.\" \nAsked about Bieber and his so-called comeback, Gomez said they no longer talk, but they're on good terms. \n\"I'm proud of him. This is what I always saw in him, why I always believed in him.\" Tony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.
