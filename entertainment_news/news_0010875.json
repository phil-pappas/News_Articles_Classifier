Comment Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:42 PM By TV Guide Miley Cyrus and the Flaming Lips want to get naked with you. On Tuesday, Cyrus' Instagram best friend and frequent collaborator, Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne , announced that the singer is planning a special nude event to promote her fifth album, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz . Oh fuck..!!! @mileycyrus is planning a show where her, the band ( us ) and the audience are all COMPLETELY naked with milk ( well white stuff that looks like milk) is being being spewed everywhere .. It's a video ( in the works) for #mileycyrusandherdeadpetz song The Milky Milky Milk... @stevendrozd @derek_levi_brown @mileycyrus @katyweaver @spacefacemusic @rockworth @leochandler @fantastic_ley @jgeeezus @zacharyancox @alphachanneling @mugglinstagram @monamuseum @happyhippiefdn @waynez__world @weirddestiny @drc3p0 @damienhirst #flaminglips #waynecoyne #mileycyrusandherdeadpetz #theflaminglips A photo posted by Wayne Coyne (@waynecoyne5) on Oct 13, 2015 at 9:14am PDT According to Coyne, the concert would also double as a music video for Cyrus' song \"The Milky Milky Milk,\" in which the former Disney star sings : \"The milky, milky milk / Your lips get me so wet / While I'm singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the dead.\" Cyrus has yet to confirm the concert, but she will be touring with the Flaming Lips this fall. So if you've ever wanted to go to a concert featuring an experimental young pop star and an aging '80s band while being completely naked and surrounded by strangers, we're betting this is your lucky day. Plus, John Mayer will probably be there . By TV Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:24:46.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
