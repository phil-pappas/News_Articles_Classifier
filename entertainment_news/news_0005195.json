The Screen Junkies poke fun at the latest nostalgia-filled installment in the “Jurassic Park” franchise, admitting that — yeah, okay — the last final fight between the velociraptor, T-Rex and Indominous Rex was pretty cool. \nChris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both scheduled to return in 2018 for the next installment, with Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly writing the script. Trevorrow is not expected to direct, and will instead serve as an executive producer alongside Steven Spielberg, who directed the first two entries in the “Jurassic Park” franchise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:58:22.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
