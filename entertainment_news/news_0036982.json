In a bit of a role reversal, the comedian had Oprah Winfrey on her show Friday, promoting the series, and sharing what she learned from DeGeneres’ episode. \n“You know what I didn’t know — and I was surprised at myself because I’m pretty empathetic as a person — but I really didn’t realize until I saw that Master Class how hard it was for you to say, ‘I’m gay,'” she said on Ellen . \nAfter realizing this, Winfrey said she finally figured out the true legacy of DeGeneres. “The real work that you’ve done on the planet will be teaching people how to live authentically as themselves,” the TV magnate said to applause. \nOther celebrities featured on this season’s Master Class include actors Robert Duvall, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Jeff Bridges along with musicians Smokey Robinson, James Taylor and Patti LaBelle. \n“I love this idea of Master Class ,” Winfrey gushed, “using people who are known, well known, to tell us about their lives in the form of a class.” \nA new season premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on OWN. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
