Cory was like a brother in so many ways. We had been together since 1965 and I am in shock at this sudden loss.\"\nAccording to Billboard , Wells shared lead vocal duties with Hutton and Chuck Negron. The band had 21 top 40 hits and hit No. 1 with three songs: \"Joy to the World,\" \"Mama Told Me (Not to Come)\" and \"Black and White.\"\nWells, born Emil Lewandowski in Buffalo in 1941, joined the U.S. Air Force after high school and formed a band called The Del-Vikings. According to the Buffalo News , he returned home after his service and played with bands like the Vibratos, the Enemys, the Fidelitones and the Satellites.\nAccording to a press release, he met Hutton in L.A. in the mid 1960s, and they set out to form a group with three lead singers. Wells never left, performing with Three Dog Night for more than 50 years until he had to drop out of the band last month due to severe back pains.\nFellow original Three Dog Night member Jimmy Greenspoon died at 67 in March from cancer.\nWells is survived by Mary, his wife of 50 years, his daughters Coryann and Dawn Marie, and five grandchildren.\nI will miss you❤️ pic.twitter.com/PWR4JZUZNG\n— Chuck Negron (@ChuckNegron) October 21, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6737500/three-dog-night-cory-wells-dies?utm_source=twitter", "https://t.co/PWR4JZUZNG", "https://twitter.com/ChuckNegron/status/656924825378680832", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0n_e1oqhiMM?rel=0", "http://buffalo.com/2015/10/21/featured/cory-wells-buffalo-born-co-founder-of-three-dog-night-dies/"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:14:38.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
