Prosecutors said she altered the books to cover up her crimes and used the pilfered money to pay for gambling trips to Indiana. The amount of money Dobrowski stole equated to months of spending in the small village for its police department or garbage disposal, officials said at the time.\nDobrowski pleaded guilty and was given an 18-month prison sentence. She was ordered to pay full restitution and owes the Internal Revenue Service another $200,000. She is serving her sentence at a minimum security federal prison camp in West Virginia and is scheduled for release in February.\nFormer Burnham clerk given 18 months in prison for theft from village By the time Burnham village clerk Nancy Dobrowski was done stealing, the tiny working-class town where she had worked more than three decades was deep in debt.\nThe police department had no money for new hires or to fix their broken radios.

In that case, Dixon officials agreed to a $40 million settlement of its lawsuit against the bank auditors, accusing them of not discovering Crundwell had stolen almost $54 million over 22 years.\n\"The Village of Burnham hired these accounting firms to perform the City audits and part of their job was to find any fraud or misstatement in the Village's finances,\" Bruce said in a statement. \"These accounting firms failed to do their job, which allowed Nancy Dobrowski's theft to continue for years.\"\ncdrhodes@tribpub.com\nTwitter @rhodes_dawn\n Theft", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-540f3f88/turbine/chi-burnham-clerk-sentenced-20140909", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5629841f/turbine/ct-burnham-clerk-lawsuit-met-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:55:54.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
