Ziggy Hood is. That's the frame coach John Fox chose to put around Wednesday's volatile eruption at Halas Hall, an incident that saw an 11th-year veteran show up to team headquarters in no condition to work, then engage in multiple heated confrontations with team officials.\nRatliff's behavior proved so erratic and so hostile that the franchise felt it necessary to summon Lake Forest police to Halas Hall as a precaution. Ratliff was officially cut the next day. And as the team returned to practice Monday after its open date, Fox preferred to downplay all that went on.\n\"Just like everything, you evaluate, and every decision we make is what we feel is best for the football team,\" Fox said in his first public comments since Ratliff's release.\nWithout question, Ratliff's outbursts last week created an unnerving situation and a tense working environment for several days. But with the Bears diving back into preparations for Sunday's home game against the Vikings, Fox opted to steer around questions about last week's drama.\nThe Bears coach said he didn't address the episode with players until a team meeting Monday morning, folding a brief discussion of the heated incident into the regular early-week talk on roster moves and adjustments.\nFox also declined to share his point of view on why the Bears felt Ratliff's temperamental behavior reached a point of no return last week.\n\"Every situation is individually different,\" he said. \"Like all our personnel decisions, regardless of who and what name's on it, it's what we feel like is best for the football team. And his was no different.\"\nBears cut Jeremiah Ratliff after heated incident at Halas Hall Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer The Bears cut defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff on Thursday, a day after the 34-year-old veteran was involved in multiple heated exchanges at Halas Hall.\nReleasing Ratliff came as a surprise in a football context.

Ratliff's number 90 had been issued to Hood, a 2009 first-round pick, who was signed as a street free agent. Hood spent last season with the Jaguars and was with the team through training camp. He was placed on injured reserve with a foot injury in early September and eventually released last week.\ndwiederer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @danwiederer\nPrivacy Policy Jeremiah Ratliff John Fox Chicago Bears Ziggy Hood", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56295436/turbine/ct-bears-jeremiah-ratliff-cut-spt-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e6b5f/turbine/ct-jeremiah-ratliff-bears-spt-1027-20151026"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:06:40.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
