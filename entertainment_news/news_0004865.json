The concerns are that the landfill is near wineries and down the block from the National Women's Hall of Fame.\nThe trash will come into the Finger Lakes region by rail, barge and trucks to the Progressive Waste Solutions' Seneca Meadows Landfill, Gannett's Nick Muscavage reports.\nWinemakers and environmental advocates said the plan would \"trash\" upstate's $4.8 billion a year wine and tourism industry, and they protested Thursday outside a hearing in New York City hearing on the proposal.\nWill Ouweleen, the co-founder of Finger Lakes Wine Business Coalition, warned that the barges would move the trash from the city to the trains, which will transport it to Waterloo. Then the trash would be taken by truck to the Seneca County landfill.\nOuweleen, who supplied Pope Francis with sacramental wine during his recent visit to New York, said he will debut a new wine label called \"No Trash! de Blasio Blush\" to gain awareness for the anti-trash campaign.\nThe Waterloo train station would need a truck depot for the high volume of trash, which could be anywhere from 400 to 600 railcar loads per day, he said.\n\"I left harvesting my grapes in the peak of our season to travel to New York City to tell Mayor de Blasio and the NYC Department of Sanitation not to trash the over $4 billion a year wine and tourism industry in the heart of upstate New York,\" Ouweleen said. \"Mayor de Blasio needs to show some respect for the hardworking people of upstate New York.\"\nThere was no immediate comment from the city or the landfill company about the plans. It was unclear if and when the trash would be transported to the landfill.\nThe battle over New York City sending its trash upstate has gone on for decades. Recently, High Acres Landfill in Wayne County became the first site in the state to accept shipments of New York City's trash via railroad in 2014.\nLast April, de Blasio announced his Zero Waste program, which aims to cut the city's waste output by 90 percent by simplifying the recycling process by introducing single stream and revamping trash collection procedures.\nThe public hearing discussed the proposed contract between the Department of Sanitation and IESI NY Corporation, which runs the Seneca Meadows Landfill in Waterloo. The landfill is four miles away from Seneca Falls, where the Women's Hall of Fame is located.\n(AP Photo)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:57:20.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
