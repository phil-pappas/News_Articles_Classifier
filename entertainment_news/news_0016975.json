Gaston/for New York Daily News Tenisha Fearon is taken into an ambulance at 2200 Tiebout Ave. in the Bronx on Oct. 15. She is accused of throwing her baby from a six-story apartment window where she lives. The Bronx woman charged with dropping her infant daughter out of a six-story window again pleaded for help Wednesday after briefly appearing in court.\n“Oh God. Oh God. Jesus, man. Help me. Help me. Oh, God,” moaned Tenisha Fearon, 27, as she was led off after a hearing in Bronx Supreme Court.\nResults of a psychiatric exam to determine if Fearon is fit to stand trial won’t be ready for another three weeks, court officials said.\nAnthony DelMundo/New York Daily News A neighbor looks out of the window at the scene where 6-month-old Junilah Lawrence was allegedly thrown out the window by her mother. In the meantime, Fearon, who was handcuffed and wearing a gray sweat suit, will not testify before the grand jury weighing murder charges against her, said her lawyer Tom Kennif.\nThe young mom is accused of dangling and then dropping little Junilah Lawrence from her top floor window on Tiebout Ave. and E. 182nd Street in Fordham on Oct. 15.\nAnthony DelMundo/New York Daily News Daysha Viz, 33, and her 8-month-old daughter, Lliv Major, pay respect by putting balloons at the makeshift memorial where 6-month-old Junilah Lawrence died. Neighbors described witnessing Fearon, standing naked at the window, yelling “we’re all going to die!” before letting her daughter plunge to her death.\nHer lawyer suggested that the accused killer, once a state licensed day care provider, may have been in the throes of a psychotic episode.\nMichael Schwartz/for New York Daily News Family members of Tenisha Fearon cry after leaving her arraignment at Bronx Supreme Court on Wednesday. “Common sense should dictate that anytime a law abiding mom of four is accused of this horrific crime, you must consider whether these acts are her own or the results of some sinister force in her mind,” said Kennif.\nWednesday’s outburst was not the first time Fearon has made a public cry for help.\n“I spoke to you and you didn’t listen!” shouted the accused killer in the direction of relatives outside of the 46th Precinct stationhouse shortly after her arrest, as she was put into a squad car to be arraigned.\nHer case was adjourned until Nov. 23, by which time she is expected to be indicted on the murder rap.\nbkochman@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Mom accused of throwing baby out window lost another to SIDS Naked Bronx mom threw baby girl from window, cops Bronx mom arrested for baby drop says calls for help ignored", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:32:45.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
