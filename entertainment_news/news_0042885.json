I was scared to go to school [because] one of them wanted to kill me. I wanted to get out of there,” he recalls. \nAdding to the pain of his parents' divorce was the death of his older brother from AIDS in 1989. “I have two gay siblings: my big sister, Rachel, and my big brother, Howard,” he tells the magazine. “He was a big influence on me. He took me to my first rock concert. I was 11; he was 23. He was so vibrant, creative, amazing. He shaped my taste in music.\" \n\"[Death] didn’t happen quickly,\" adds Black. \"We all saw the deterioration. He was only 31. So very young. We were robbed of something precious. It was devastating. It was hard for all of us, but it was hardest for my mom when we lost Howard. She’s never really recovered.” \nPerhaps Black's dark past shaped his performance in the upcoming film Goosebumps , telling Parade , “[It's] a really fun role. It’s about forgiveness and not letting your rage and thirst for revenge control you, but it’s also about how some of those darker emotions can be used to create great masterworks. I play a guy with a dark past and a brilliant mind, wrestling with his own demons, literally.” \nThe School of Rock star's past has also kept him devoted to his wife of nearly 10 years, Tanya Haden, and their two sons, Samuel, nine, and Thomas, seven. \n“Sometimes I think maybe I’m a little bit of a helicopter dad hovering above my kids and making sure that they never are in harm’s way,” he admits. “But losing a family member is the worst thing I could imagine.” \nIn Goosebumps , opening nationwide October 16, Black plays R.L. Stine, a fictionalized version of the real-life writer of popular children’s books, whose frightening monsters from his dark imagination are accidentally “released” from his books and run amok, terrorizing the town. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:59:46.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
