The player unable to hear had to guess what the other was saying by reading their lips, which resulted in the two laughing so hard they were at times unable to speak.\nThe Room actress was up first for the game previously played by the likes of Rebel Wilson and Julia Louis-Dreyfus . She successfully guessed Fallon's first phrase, \"the pursuit of happiness,\" fairly quickly, but the phrases increased in lip-reading difficulty as the game moved forward.\nLarson was prompted to guess Fallon's words as he whispered \"got my mind on my money and my money on my mind,\" causing the actress to utter nonsensical words in an attempt to keep up with the Tonight Show host.\nFallon himself couldn't quite succeed in guessing the last phrase uttered by his 26-year-old guest. \"Crouching tiger, hidden dragon,\" turned into \"round straight sucker eats straights,\" after Fallon finished with it.\n 'Dancing With the Stars': Kim Zolciak to undergo heart surgery Keanu Reeves puts safety first in 'Speed' parody on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' Lance Bass: I was inappropriately touched by a pedophile as a teen", "external_links": ["https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BMABwrmXYY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BMABwrmXYY", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/09/brie-larson-jimmy-fallon-whisper-challenge"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:44:21.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
