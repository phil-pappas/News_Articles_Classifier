A solo piano recital featuring guest artist John McKay, D.M.A., will be held at the historic 1913 Steinway grand piano in Kiehle Auditorium at the U of M Crookston on Sunday, Oct. 25. McKay, whose career as a recitalist, collaborative musician, and soloist with the orchestra spans more than five decades, will be in concert beginning at 7 p.m. The recital is free and the public is welcome to attend. Parking permits are not required. The program will feature the Beethoven Sonata in E flat major and the Brahms Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel. Also included will be the Bach English Suite No. 3 in G minor and the Dubussy Three Water Pieces. McKay is an American pianist and music educator of Canadian birth who has performed in concerts, recitals and on radio and television broadcasts throughout North America and Europe. Born and raised in Montreal, Canada, he graduated from McGill University. He earned graduate degrees at the Eastman School of Music where he studied with Eugene List and David Burge. McKay spent most of the sixties in Europe studying and concertizing widely. He taught at the University of Toronto in Ontario and Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, Minn., where he taught piano and the history of music for 28 years. For 17 of those years, he also directed Minnesota Valley Sommarfest, a festival of chamber music held every July at Gustavus. He continues to be in demand as a recitalist. McKay is married to Sara Hayden McKay, who directs the St. Peter Choral Society and the couple was honored in 2000 by the Minnesota State Arts Board for their contributions to the arts.
