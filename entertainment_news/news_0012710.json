Aw, he’s quite humble actually. Don't normally trust documentaries, but Rooney seems surprisingly humble. Respect. #manbehindthegoals \n— Matthew Lloyd (@mrmglloyd) October 5, 2015 \n2. The fact that he didn’t really want to go to a trial at Liverpool age 11 – and went in his Everton kit instead – is pretty hilarious. So Wayne Rooney once had a trial at Liverpool and decided to turn up in an Everton shirt! #ManBehindTheGoals pic.twitter.com/XH8YgxKsca \n— BreatheSport (@BreatheSport) October 5, 2015 \n3. Woah, 16 is young to be a Premier League player. Great documentary on Wayne Rooney by Gary Lineker. Won't see a 16 yr old burst on the scene like that again for England. #grateful #ROONEY \n— Dan Cox (@DannoCox) October 5, 2015 \n4. The first goal he scored for Everton at that level, fresh off the bench, was pretty special (it also made him the league’s youngest ever goal scorer). Rooney was a blue originally (BBC/Screenshot) I remember that Arsenal goal I lost my voice that day #ManBehindTheGoals \n— Pauline Kilgallon (@paulykil) October 5, 2015 \n5. He was really just a 16-year-old who loved football, wasn’t he? even as a prem player went out on the streets to play with his pals after the games #magic #Rooney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:18:56.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
