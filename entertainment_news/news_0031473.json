Allred represents Judy Huth, who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him in the 1970s. \nAllred says Huth will be deposed Thursday. She says a California judge will decide in December if the testimony will be made public. \nLawyers for the 78-year-old Cosby say Huth’s lawsuit is frivolous and that Huth’s former attorney attempted to extort Cosby. \nCosby also faces two other cases: a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a suit filed Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her. \nLaBeouf charged with public intoxication \nAUSTIN, Texas \nActor Shia LaBeouf was arrested and charged with public intoxication after an incident in Austin, Texas. \nThe Austin Police Department said in a news release that LaBeouf was arrested at 7:33 p.m. Friday. \nJail records show he was booked into the Travis County Jail and released on his own recognizance. No attorney was listed on the record. \nHe was arrested in the city’s Sixth Street entertainment district, where the Austin City Limits music festival is taking place through today. \nPolice did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for additional details. His publicist did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the arrest. \nThe 29-year-old previously made headlines with bizarre escapades – including yelling from the audience during a Broadway show and wearing a paper bag on his head to a movie premiere – and has been treated for an alcohol problem. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:20:26.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
