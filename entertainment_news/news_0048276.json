Hall, the co-founder of FAME music studios and author of the new autobiography, “The Man from Muscle Shoals: My Journey from Shame to Fame,” will share stories of his experiences in the industry breaking music and racial barriers throughout the state and the nation. Set on both sides of the bay, the first of two scheduled appearances will take place on Wednesday, November 4 at the Alabama Contemporary Art Center (formerly known as Space 301) in Mobile, AL, starting at 5 pm. General admission tickets are $15 and VIP tickets are $50. VIP tickets include premium seating and a signed copy of Hall’s book. Copies of “The Man from Muscle Shoals” will be available for purchase at the event. $5 from ticket purchase may be used towards a book purchase. The Alabama Contemporary Art Center is located 301 Conti Street in Mobile.\n“After an amazing visit with Rick Hall at our store in May, I just knew we had to get him back to Fairhope with a goal to come together to produce a memorable event for music enthusiasts on both sides of the bay. Rick Hall’s story is a powerful inspiration for so many. This book covers even more music history than the celebrated documentary,” states Karin Wilson, Page & Palette Bookstore.\nThe following evening, November 5, Page & Palette Bookstore, Fairhope, AL will host a free event with book purchase required to attend the intimate discussion (seating is limited to 100) and secure a signed copy of Hall’s book.

The event begins at 5:30 pm.\n“Rick Hall has been recognized as a great American treasure of his generation,” says Ed Fields, Director of Events and Community Engagement at AL.com. “These events will be entertaining, inspiring and informative. It’s not every day AL.com readers can invite a friend or young person to experience a living legend in person.
