They wanted to talk. “Opera fans love to talk,” whether it’s about the best productions they’ve seen or performances they’ve hated, says Christopher Ostrom, WHAT’s managing director and artistic associate, as he recounts that gathering. “Opera patrons are so passionate, and we want to try to channel that.” So WHAT officials are inviting more audience members to regularly talk and learn about that passion. For eight years, WHAT has been one of two Cape Cod venues – Cape Cinema in Dennis is the other – to show the live simulcasts of performances from the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The Wellfleet venue draws steady crowds to watch both the live showings on the big screen at the Julie Harris Stage as well as the encore showings a week later. WHAT has also long sponsored a Wellfleet Opera Guild that offers fans a chance to gather ahead of the events, enjoy snacks and hear lectures to enhance the opera-going experience. This season – and Ostrom refers to the “opera season” just as he talks about WHAT’s “theater season”– the lectures will be expanded and open to all, with organizers hoping more patrons will also become members of the guild. “We realized in talking to patrons that it’s not only the opera experience, but the social experience” that makes the series popular, Ostrom says. “It’s the opportunity to get out of the house in the winter and talk to like-minded people.” For the majority of the live showings this season – beginning with Saturday’s – WHAT will offer a lecture that starts at noon on some aspect of opera to help “deepen the experience,” Ostrom says. He will do the talking for Saturday’s show, lecturing on composer Guiseppe Verdi’s life, including the phases of his career and his tumultuous personal relationships. That lecture will provide background on Saturday’s “Il Trovatore” (encoring Oct. 10) as well as “Otello,” which will be simulcast Oct. 17 with an encore Oct. 24. More details on additional lectures will be announced in emails and on what.org as they become available. Looking ahead to the rest of the season, Ostrom is most excited about “Lulu” on Nov. 21 because the opera is so rarely performed and is among the more “adventurous fare” in the season. Ostrom also mentions a Dec. 12-13 repeat of Julie Taymor’s family-friendly adaptation of “The Magic Flute“ that the Met is offering as part of its celebration of 10 years of live broadcasting of the performances there. That show for all ages and any others can work as a good introduction to opera that could fuel a new love, Ostrom says. The technology for these simulcasts has opened up a link to a wider world that has brought big winter audiences to WHAT. The series has shown that “you don’t have to live in a big city to experience a really, really high-class performance” of opera, he says, along with the interviews and backstage looks at scene changes and other aspects of production that are part of the live broadcasts. The WHAT shows also offer reserved stadium seating and light lunch options before the show and during intermissions. Seeing an opera this way “is not expensive, it’s right in your backyard, you don’t have to dress up and it’s during the day,” Ostrom says. “It’s a great way to be introduced to opera.” By Kathi Scrizzi Driscoll", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:24:07.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
