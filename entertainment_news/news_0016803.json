Mipcom will open for business on time,\" the statement said\n\nBut whether it is business as usual for television's power-lunching, phone-wielding deal-makers remains to be seen: Cannes' vibrant restaurant strip is, in parts, still without access to EFTPOS, and mobile phone coverage in the small town is patchy at best.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, simply getting to Cannes has become a challenge, as flights were diverted from the nearby Nice-Cote d'Azur airport, train services were stopped due to flooding on the tracks and the few highways which service the coast were either closed or narrowed to a single lane.\nA man tries to make his way after floods hit Biot, near Cannes.

Mandelieu-La Napoule mayor Henri Leroy described some of the scenes as \"apocalyptic\".\n\nOfficials say the death toll could reach 16 or higher, it already includes at least seven people who died in their cars when an underground car park filled with storm water.\n\nAs is customary with many of the events which are held in Cannes, the town's capacity is expected to be pushed to breaking point in the next few days with the influx of approximately 13,600 attendees, most of them exhibitors and sellers of television programs.\n\nApproximately 4500 buyers will be shopping for content, and of those, about 1300 are from streaming and on-demand platforms such as Netflix.\n\nThe streaming and on-demand segment of the industry - that is, VOD (video on demand, such as iView or Hulu) and SVOD (subscription video on demand, such as Netflix, Stan, Amazon or Presto) - represents almost one third of all program buyers.\n\nGiven that traditional television has not shrunk overall, it demonstrates powerfully the extent to which so-called \"disruptors\" have pushed into the broadcasting space.\n\nIn total, there are more than 2000 companies exhibiting content from approximately 100 countries.\n\nAmong the high-profile guests at this year's market are the newly anointed Top Gear host Chris Evans, Heroes Reborn creator Tim Kring, British screenwriter Andrew Davies and The X-Files creator/producer Chris Carter.\n\nCarter will attend the world premiere of the updated The X-Files , a limited series commissioned by 20th Century Fox which will see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson return to their roles as Mulder and Scully after a decade.\n\nFox's two senior-most studio executives, Dana Walden and Gary Newman, will also be honoured at the market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:19:29.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
