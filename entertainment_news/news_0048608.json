Photo: Getty Images \nIf you thought there was something amiss about Taylor Swift's exclusive girl 'squad' of celebrities, even a little creepy, you're not the only one.\nAmerican sketch show  Saturday Night Live has produced a sinister trailer for a fictitious film The Squad  which imagines a post-apocalyptic future ruled by Swift's BFFs. In it, on-believers are hunted down and converted to share Swift's love of tacos and \"matching American flag-towels\" and \"walking around for a minute\" on her tour stage.\nTwo girlfriends (played by Vanessa Bayer and Aidy Bryant) wake up in hospital (think 28 Days Later , or perhaps Party Rock Anthem ) and wander the desolate streets asking 'where did everybody go?'. A deep-voiced narrator explains: Taylor Swift has taken over the globe. \nBEVERLY HILLS, CA - JANUARY 11: Actress/director Lena Dunham (L) and singer/songwriter Taylor Swift attend HBO's Official Golden Globe Awards After Party at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 11, 2015 in Beverly Hills, California.

By the end of her tour the entire world had joined.\"\nAdvertisement On cue, a huge 1989 tour banner is unfurled from a building as the squad claims yet more territory.\nA frightened man explains more to the girls in another scene: \"First it was the models, the the athletes, then everybody. Police fire department, Matt Le Blanc,\" he says, breaking down.\n\"[I had] daughters, two of 'em. The squad took 'em. I don't know [where they are now]. Probably having some sort of taco night.\"\nSwift's so-called squad includes an army of supermodels, actresses and musicians including Jessica Alba, Lena Dunham, Selena Gomez, Cara Delevingne, Martha Hunt, Mariska Hargitay, Karlie Kloss, the Haim sisters and Lorde.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:53:38.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
