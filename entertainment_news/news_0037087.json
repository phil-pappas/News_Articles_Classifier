Being flexible – especially when it's in your interests to let someone else win. Capitalise on this week's advantageous career stars with strategic moves; you enjoy competition, but no need to make war.  \n*VIRGO: Mars in Virgo wants to change the world. Jupiter in Virgo wants to educate the world. Venus in Virgo wants personal housekeeping: a self-enquiry into redecorating your room for improvement. Regarding all of which, does it really matter whether the glass is half full or half empty? Isn't it refillable?  \n*LIBRA: With your planet ruler Venus supporting energetic Mars and confidence-booster Jupiter in the sort-it-out sign of do the right thing, this busy week presses the start button on something you haven't been quite ready till now to take on. Beneficial connections with like-minded others are beckoning.\n*SCORPIO: As the sun shines its light on your happy birthday month and personal zone of leadership, this week highlights all the progress you've made in mastering Saturn's two-year long, hard look at yourself, and sometimes gruelling boot camp. Now the identity crisis is over, it's time for reinvention… \n*SAGITTARIUS: Saturn in your sign for the coming couple of years challenges you to identify weak links in your operating techniques that need developing, plus any tiny minor flaws in your awesome personality that may need refining. Sagittarius and Saturn are both teachers, so this week features themes of education and professional development. \n*CAPRICORN: As your ruling planet Saturn takes up residence in Capricorn's twelfth house of slowdown and healing forgiveness, get ready for a reflective three-year exploration of the inner you – along with the possible sacrifice of some part of your persona. If you've experienced a loss, this week offers therapeutic closure. \n*AQUARIUS: Yes, you space cadets are made of star stuff ... whose current address is earth, where accounts need to be paid. Sharing resources may make that easier to achieve this week – which is a good one for acknowledging the valuable contributions a partner, friend, group or mentor has made in your life. \n*PISCES: For your mutable sign, the present Saturn cycle initiates a long-term total restructure of your personal and professional life to a newer, more mature shape.
