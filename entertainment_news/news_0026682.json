Allardyce made the remark in his new book, “Big Sam”, in which he details the reasons for his feud with the Frenchman. Wenger and Allardyce have repeatedly clashed since first coming head-to-head when the latter was in charge at English club Bolton Wanderers.

We’d really got to them and Arsene Wenger hated us,” Allardyce was quoted as saying by The Sun on Monday. ”There was one time he wouldn’t shake hands with me at Highbury ground because we got a draw there. I saw him ripping his tie off and throwing it on the floor in anger,” he said. \nAllardyce said Wenger took things personally and has an air of arrogance. ”He takes it all very personally and has an air of arrogance. He’s not one for inviting you into his office for a drink after the game,” Allardyce said. ”The more I wound him up, the more I liked it. He tried to influence referees through the media and create a perception that we were bullies committing all the fouls, while his team just wanted to play,” the Sunderland manager said.
