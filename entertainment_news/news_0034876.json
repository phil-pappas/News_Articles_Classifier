So many strands. You have to have large sections where the plot is explained, just have to sit there and be told what's going on. This is very, very dull. So they put a lot of naked women behind it all.\n\"They're called 'sexplanations' in the trade. My programmes won't need sexplanations.\"\nAnother of his famous creations is the character of Richard Sharpe, which was later turned into hit TV series Sharpe.\nActor Sean Bean was cast in the lead role and Cornwell is honest about the fact that Bean was not, at first, his idea of Sharpe.\n\"But he was terrific and I wrote Sharpe differently after Sean,\" he said.\nThe author, now 71, has not had any say in the adaptation of The Last Kingdom. \"I'll watch it with the rest of you when it goes out on the BBC,\" he said.\nHis books have sold millions all over the world and he is so popular he was mobbed in Brazil.\nShare article \"It was like being a rock star,\" he said, \"Never has one elderly Anglo-Saxon been kissed by so many Latino girls.\"\nThe Last Kingdom airs on BBC2 on October 22 at 9pm.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-13T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:22:19.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
