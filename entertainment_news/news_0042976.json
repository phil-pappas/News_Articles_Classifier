Stephen K Amos will be in Geelong for one night only. Source: Supplied \nSTEPHEN K Amos is delighted at both the recent political ructions and the fervour building around the weekend’s ‘tournament’. \nIt’s all fodder for the English comedian who will be in Geelong for one night only, on Tuesday. \n“The constant change of prime minister and the backstabbing and extraordinary things that are happening and the amazing football tournament and a public holiday for it, which cements the fact Australians are obsessed with sport, it’s all interesting to me,’’ he said. \n“And having just come from the UK and Europe with the refugee crisis, and you have the boat people crisis here. It’s high on the agenda too.’’ \nHis Geelong show will also include components of other shows he has done, both recently as part of the Melbourne Comedy Festival and from further back. \n“A lot of the stuff people won’t have seen and it’s very, very funny,’’ he said. Amos for PM Stephen K Amos reveals his desire to take over Australia \nAmos considered the change in the comedic landscape from when he first took to the stage in 1997. \nBack then it was “just having a laugh” in a pub with an audience of maybe only 20 people. \n“I never really had a career plan, but it has become an amazing booming industry,” he said. \n“There are courses people can do. When I started it was not about the fame, but now people see comedy as a career option.” \nAmos is not the first comedian to make the jump from law to comedy. Although he never practised law, he said there are commonalities between law and making people laugh. \n“I think it’s because of the analytical mind, always questioning things,’’ he said. \n“Trying to convince a jury is like trying to convince an audience.’’ \nAmos said he intended to “hide from the frenzy of the AFL Grand Final and bask with a few friends in the sun”, before his Geelong visit. \nThis is the first time he has toured regionally. \nStephen K Amos in Welcome to my World , will be at GPAC on Tuesday, 7.30pm. Tickets are $40 or less on 5225 1200.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:18:40.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
