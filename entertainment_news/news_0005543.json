Winners in each of the four competitive categories — fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people's literature — will be announced at a Nov. 18 ceremony in Manhattan, hosted by humorist Andy Borowitz. Don DeLillo and James Patterson will receive honorary prizes. \nThe awards will be a showcase for numerous younger writers, from the 40-year-old Coates to the 37-year-old Groff to 23-year-old cartoonist Noelle Stevenson, a finalist in young people's literature. \nLonglists of 10 for the National Book Awards were released last month, with judges on Wednesday narrowing the number in each category to five. A total of 1,428 books was submitted to the judging panels, which consist of authors, critics, booksellers and others in the publishing community willing to set aside weeks and even months to read through the nominated material. Winning authors each receive $10,000 and a bronze statue. \nCoates, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, recently received a MacArthur \"genius grant,\" and his emotional and despairing letter to his teenage son about race and police violence has been one of the year's most talked-about books.
