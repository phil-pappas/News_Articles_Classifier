Preferably at the same time.\nIf you find the notion too disturbing to watch this horrifying show (we can't blame you) but want to know what happens anyway, here's the deal about Lady Gaga's character.\nThe gist: Lady Gaga plays the Countess, who according to Entertainment Weekly, is \"a glamorous socialite who attends art openings and fashion shows and maintains her looks not from a steady diet of kale but from imbibing human blood.\" Showrunner Ryan Murphy says not to call her a vampire: \"I prefer the term 'ancient blood virus,'\" he told EW.\nThe Countess lives in the top floor of the very haunted and terrifying Hotel Cortez, which isn't an ideal hotel stay unless you want to be attacked, murdered or dismembered.\nOrigin story: We don't know the details yet, but viewers see a flashback to the hotel in 1991, when a drug addict named Donovan (Matt Bomer) had an overdose. We see The Countess appear from nowhere and cradle Donovan in her arms as his mother, Iris (Kathy Bates), sobs. \"Your boy has a jaw line for days,\" the Countess says, tracing his face with her glove. Flash forward to present day, and Donovan - maybe a ghost now? - is somehow still alive and living with the Countess.\nViewers go gaga for 'American Horror Story: Hotel' premiere Rick Kissell \"American Horror Story\" fell a little short of a same-day series record but still made quite an impression in its return Wednesday, as the \"Hotel\" installment of the franchise -- featuring Lady Gaga in her TV series debut -- opened to big numbers for FX and stood as the night's No. 2 program in...\n\"American Horror Story\" fell a little short of a same-day series record but still made quite an impression in its return Wednesday, as the \"Hotel\" installment of the franchise -- featuring Lady Gaga in her TV series debut -- opened to big numbers for FX and stood as the night's No. 2 program in...\n(Rick Kissell) Hobbies: Considering the Countess has a light-up sign in her hotel room that says \"Why aren't we having sex right now?\"... you can probably guess. In her first scene, she and Donovan dress up in fancy clothes, go to a theater and lure an attractive couple back to their room. It quickly turns into a murder-orgy. While they're all having sex, the Countess and Donovan stab the unsuspecting couple and bask in all the blood.\nDialogue after the scene:\nCountess: \"I know you didn't feel like going out tonight.\"\nDonovan: \"It's not the getting ready. It's the clean-up.\"\nCountess: \"Call housekeeping.\"\nPersonality: Impatient. We gather this because Iris (she's also the surly hotel concierge) kidnaps some Swedish tourists. When one escapes, the Countess stops the tourist in her tracks and slices her throat open, leaving her bleeding out on the floor.\n\"This can never happen again,\" the Countess tells Iris, eyeing the blood.\nLady Gaga said she felt alive and 'like herself' on 'AHS' Tribune wire reports Appearing in the new season of \"American Horror Story\" was a life boost for Lady Gaga.\nThe singer raved about her experience on \"American Horror Story: Hotel\" as she arrived for the star-studded premiere of the FX show on Saturday night.\nWith fiancé Taylor Kinney as her date, Lady Gaga said the...\nAppearing in the new season of \"American Horror Story\" was a life boost for Lady Gaga.\nThe singer raved about her experience on \"American Horror Story: Hotel\" as she arrived for the star-studded premiere of the FX show on Saturday night.\nWith fiancé Taylor Kinney as her date, Lady Gaga said the...\n(Tribune wire reports) ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617b852/turbine/ct-ratings-american-horror-story-hotel-premiere-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613ea4e/turbine/ct-lady-gaga-american-horror-story-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618016f/turbine/ct-lady-gaga-american-horror-story-hotel-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:57:36.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
