I just really had to take a look at myself and my life and the way s*** was going, and all the crazy, stupid s*** I was doing and just finally admit to myself that it wasn't working.\" \nHanks, 25, also owned up to using the N-word inappropriately in the past, even though he says he didn't use it in a malicious way. \n\"I know a lot of y'all understood the point I was trying to make, but the truth is it's not my place to speak on that and I'm genuinely sorry for the people that I offended,\" he said. \nAll the antics in the past are not who the artist wants to be, he continued. \n\"It's been a long journey for me...because of all the pressures that I've dealt with in my life, being the son of my dad and everything,\" he said. \"Just trying to find where I fit in.\" \nHe also explained his dependency on drugs before going to rehab and told others struggling with addiction to message him. \n\"A couple months ago, I was selling coke, doing coke until I couldn't even snort it up my nose, it was so clogged,\" he explained. \"I even smoked crack. If I can change, you can change, there is a solution.\" \nHe closed by thanking everyone for listening to his story. \"If you are dealing with this s***, take yourself to a meeting,\" he said. \nTom Hanks' rep did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his son. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
