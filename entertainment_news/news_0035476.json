A native to Calabria ( Southern Italy ), he is one of the most striking and eclectic contemporary artists at an international level. He designed the MUSABA, the Santa Barbara Museum and Laboratory Park, which has been operating since 1969 in Mammola, in the province of Reggio Calabria. It is a dynamic and evolving experiment exploring new frontiers of creativity that combine the sense of the future with the knowledge of the past.\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279217LOGO )\nThe exhibition was organised and promoted by the 'Terzo Pilastro - Italia e Mediterraneo' Foundation and its President, Prof. Emmanuele Francesco Maria Emanuele . It will be hosted at the premises of UniversitÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ degli Studi Suor Orsola Benincasa in cooperation with MUSABA-Fondazione Spatari/Maas.\n\"I decided to organise an exhibition on this extraordinary artist not only because of the powerful impact of his artworks,\" said the President Emanuele. \"Spatari has greatly contributed to the exchange and contamination among contemporary artistic languages at an international level through the 'Santa Barbara' Museum Park and, above all, he has succeeded in establishing a fruitful interaction between culture and the local area, and Calabria in particular. I have always been a firm supporter of art when it breaks through borders and actively promotes education within the surroundings with the aim of revamping it. Let's think of how I used street art to turn Tor Marancia, a working-class neighbourhood in Rome , into a place that now attracts more visitors than a museum. Through the Terzo Pilastro Foundation, my effort is to apply the same model in other areas of Southern Italy .\"\nThe Foundation, promoter of the exhibition, is active in the social, healthcare, educational, cultural and artistic fields and also supports scientific research and welfare.\nAlready the Foundation's name bears witness to its commitment to solidarity and subsidiary work in combination with its role as a trait d ' union among cultures and civil societies of the Mediterranean. Through its second 'soul', in particular, the Foundation turns its gaze to the Countries on the Mediterranean shores and launches initiatives aimed at opening a dialogue among different cultures and traditions.\nNik Spatari\nUniversita ' degli Studi Suor Orsola Benincasa - Naples\n23 October > 23 November 2015\nMonday to Friday, 10:00 am to 5:30 pm\nFree admission\nInfo:\nmostranikspatari@civita.it\nhttp://www.fondazioneterzopilastro.it\nhttp://www.musaba.org\ntel: + 390697625591\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201510213563&Transmission_Id=201510230600PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201510213563&DateId=20151023", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279217LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:22:26.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
