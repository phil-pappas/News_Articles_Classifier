But Jamie feels that working with Zayn could cause problems because of his history with the band.'' \nZayn is said to be planning to release his first solo effort as soon as One Direction finish promotion for their upcoming new album 'Made in the A.M.' and take their announced hiatus. \nThe source added: ''In any case Zayn won't be releasing his single until 1D is out the way and a couple of other 1D singles are out.'' \nZayn has spoken with music manager Sarah Stennett, who helped stars including Rita Ora and Ellie Goulding hit the big time, to help him launch himself as a solo star.
