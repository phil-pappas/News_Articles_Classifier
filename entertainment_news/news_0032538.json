Oil on canvas, 190.5 x 215.9 cm (75 x 85 in), Private collection. George Condo Studios © ARS, NY and DACS, London 2015. \nBoobs and pubes; wrinkles and dimples; backs and torsos and hands and faces and bums. Loads of glorious bums. A new book published by Phaidon is all about the body in art, featuring works from the ancient to the present day, the traditional to the downright trippy. Rather than a simple, chronological narrative, Body of Art features works around a series of themes and pits contemporary opposite primitive and antiquities against impressionists.\nApart from being more engaging than a straight history of art, it is more confronting, posing questions about our perceptions of ourselves, our forebears, our assumptions about history and the universal issues facing humanity. \nWhen Phaidon's group publisher Deborah Aaronson started researching alternative structures for art books, she found lots of histories of the nude, or books about artists using their bodies as part of the artistic process. She couldn't find a book that encapsulated not only how the human form has been represented but how it reflected the human experience. \"I don't think about this book as an art book, I think it's a book that uses art to talk about what it means to be human; what does it mean to have a physical body and to live in it.\"\nFelix Vallotton, Study of buttocks , 1884. Oil on canvas, 38 x 46 cm (15 x 18 in), Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam. akg-images \nShe knew from the outset the book would include four key themes: beauty, identity, power and the absent body. Additional chapters include religion, sex and gender, emotion, the body's limits, bodies and space and the abject body. Adopting a narrative with ideas as the starting point meant that the works of art could live with one another in a more dynamic way. \"You could see there are themes that have carried all the way through to today and that could provide more lively juxtapositions and challenge our notions about what some of these classical works are about,\" says Aaronson.\nAdvertisement Four Phaidon staff were assigned to the project: one a classicist, one contemporary, another with extensive knowledge of the period 1800-1950 and Aaronson, with a strong photographic background. As well as the inhouse team's ideas, they asked curators, gallery owners, other artists, critics and writers which works they thought should feature. \nThe end result was hundreds and hundreds of suggestions. \"Once we had them all pulled together, we really honed down on the thematic chapters. In a group we just interrogated each of the images and asked, 'Is it interesting, does it make a point, is it doing something different?\"'\nQiu Zhijie, Tattoo II , 1994. Chromogenic print. \nThe criteria was that each piece was created purely as a work of art – the exception being some early works, which may have had a religious use. The editors didn't want to include multiple works by individual artists, (\"You could include 500 Rubens ... \"), and were seeking a broad range of material from a cross-section of nationalities and gender, and in various styles and mediums. A shortlist of 450 images was determined, after which Aaronson says it was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, matching or contrasting them with other pieces. Some would enhance the meaning of works opposite, others sat well in terms of colour pallette, shapes or the straight aesthetic. \nBotticelli's The Birth of Venus, 1486 , one of the most famous artworks in the world, is immediately followed by Vanessa Beecroft's VB 46 2011 , from a performance piece in which nearly 20 women are naked but for high heels and wigs. Beecroft subverts the traditional European classical nude, with her \"constellation of bodies\", who stand and gaze almost defiantly at the viewer. \nWhile transgender might be considered a contemporary issue, the book features a first century BC sculpture, Sleeping hermaphroditus , by an unknown artist. From one angle it looks like an incredibly beautiful woman, from another it's not that simple – a male appendage is clear. A picture of American photographer Nan Goldin – sporting a black, bloodshot eye and bruised face after being beaten up by her boyfriend – is juxtaposed against a sculpture from the 1500s of the rape of the Sabine women. \"[The book shows] how that gets portrayed in classical art as opposed to the more complicated or challenging ways that contemporary artists are doing it and vice versa,\" says Aaronson; one of the aims of the book is to show that these struggles date back from a very long time ago. \nThere's a playful element, too. Jeff Koons' Woman in tub, 1988 , for example, is the contemporary American artist's take on art's tradition of a woman bathing. His work features an almost cartoon-like, male fetishised image of a woman with her head half sliced off, balloon breasts and mouth agape, sitting in a small bath with what seems to be a periscope in the water in front of her. Opposite is Sylvia Sleigh's The Turkish Bath, 1973 , a painting that deals with the same tradition but shows men bathing; their poses reflect a confidence rarely seen in classic works.  Several works are prescient. Jana Sterbak's Vanitas: Fleshdress for an albino anorectic, 1987, is one; it predates Lady Gaga's MTV Awards meatdress by several decades.\nIt's a mark of our humanity that we create art. The human body is the most commonly produced image in art; ever since homo erectus became homo sapiens, we have been driven to reproduce what we see of ourselves. Aaronson sees this compulsion to express ourselves as a defining element of  the book – and art in general. \"All of the artists felt a need or a desire to mark a physical presence ... or express themselves through the body.\"  \nPicasso pondered \"Who sees the human body correctly: the photographer, the mirror or the painter? And are we to paint what's on the face, what's inside the face or what's behind it?\" It's a question addressed again and again throughout Body of Art , with artists across the centuries coming up with a fascinating array of responses. \nBody of Art is out now, published by Phaidon.   \nwww.phaidon.com/bodyofartbook/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:30:54.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
