The Liberal MP – a former small businessman and first grade rugby union player – visits galleries whenever he travels.

Photo: Andrew Meares \nOn the first floor of the building, not far from the House of Representatives chamber, an exhibit titled The Art of Shakespeare is on display. It's a showcase of 14 works inspired by the Bard's plays – including The Witches , an eye-catching piece by Wendy Sharpe.\nAdvertisement A painting based on Shakespeare's famous tale of ambition and betrayal seems a perfect fit for a building that has had five prime ministers over the past five years.\nBut Kelly says the prominent female buttocks featured in the work are inappropriate, even if the exhibit comes with a \"partial nudity\" warning. \nThe artwork on display inside Parliament House.

It's a tourist attraction in itself. I personally would like to see more historical artwork.\"\nDetail from The Witches by Wendy Sharpe.

The rest hang on the walls of Parliament, Admiralty House, Government House or are on loan to other galleries.\nKelly uploaded a photo of the painting on his Facebook page this week, posing the question: \"Do you think this painting is suitable for Parliament House?\"\nSo far, the respondents are firmly on his side.\n\"Horrid\", \"not art, that's crap\", \"grotesque\", \"bloody awful\" are some of the responses.\nOne Facebook user could even detect the sinister influence of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the art lover who famously owns two Henson photographs.\n\"This is what happens when the progressives take control,\" the commenter wrote. \"Standards slip.\"\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:59:20.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
