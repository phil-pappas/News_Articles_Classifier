He called Murphy his \"comedic hero.\"\nMorgan survived a serious car crash last year that left him in a coma. Morgan said Murphy was the first person to call him on the phone and make him laugh after the tragic accident that killed a passenger in the limo and seriously injured two others\n\"He's the reason I'm in comedy. He's the reason I have a job. He's the reason I have a career,\" Morgan said.\nAt one point, Murphy offered a reminder of his willingness to do politically incorrect humor by offering some jokes about former Mark Twain award winner Bill Cosby — who was one of his \"heroes,\" but has been accused by various women of sexual misconduct.\nAmong the other SNL alumni who paid tribute to Murphy were Jay Pharoah , Kevin Nealon and Joe Piscopo .\n\"Some people are just blessed with talent, and with Eddie, it was just luck,\" Nealon ribbed.\nNealon said Murphy saved SNL from slumping ratings in the 1980s, and he hoped he could also save the Kennedy Center from becoming the Trump Center .\n\"I can see the slot machines in the lobby,\" joked Nealon, who starred with Murphy in \"Daddy Day Care.\"\nTrevor Noah , who took over hosting \"The Daily Show\" in September, said he was introduced to the comedian after viewing of \"Coming to America.\"\n\"Eddie Murphy's influenced almost every single comedian— especially of my generation. He did everything brilliantly,\" Noah said, in an interview with The Associated Press . \"He showed me a benchmark to aim for. He made me realize that there was a level of excellence to try and attain, and I still think I'm working at that 'til this day.\"\nMurphy called the prize a \"tremendous honor,\" but asked the center to clear up any confusion over the prize for future recipients.\n\"Actually, it's an award, but they call it a prize,\" he said. \"Usually when there's a prize, there's money.\"\nIn referring to Cosby, Murphy joked that you know you've messed up \"when they want you to give your trophy back.\" Murphy did an impersonation of Cosby refusing to give back his award.\nCosby, who received the award in 2009, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct, including allegations by many that he drugged and raped them.\nThe humor prize honors those who influence society in the tradition of Samuel Clemens , the writer and satirist known as Mark Twain. Past honorees include Jay Leno , Carol Burnett , Tina Fey , Whoopi Goldberg , Ellen DeGeneres , Will Ferrell and Richard Pryor .\nMurphy gained national attention when he joined the SNL cast in 1980 at the age of 19. He went on to become the most commercially successful African-American actor in film history and one of the industry's Top 5 box office performers overall, the Kennedy Center said. Murphy's films have been among Hollywood's highest-grossing comedies, including \"48 Hours,\" ''Trading Places,\" ''Dr. Dolittle\" and \"Coming to America.\"\nThe tribute will be broadcast Nov. 23 on PBS.\n___\nOnline:\nMark Twain Award: http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/marktwain", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/marktwain", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:56:34.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
