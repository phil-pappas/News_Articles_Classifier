There was that herd that cornered and chewed up Noah last season.\nBut we’ve never seen a herd the size of Sunday’s overpopulated opener.\nWe’re talking hundreds — thousands, maybe — of hungry undead.\nCall it escalation, maybe in response to the tepid spinoff “Fear the Walking Dead,” but “Walking Dead” in its sixth season premiere wants you to remember the nightmare started here, and this show owns it.\nThe extended 90-minute episode, written by Scott M. Gimple and Matt Negrete and directed by Greg Nicotero, plays with time as our survivors try to execute one of Rick’s (Andrew Lincoln) riskiest plans — and Rick’s plans don’t have a terrific success rate. The show jumps back to just hours after last season’s finale and then leaps, perhaps days ahead.\nRick and Morgan (Lennie James, at last, thankfully a show regular) are still trying to figure out this bromance thing. It’s complicated. It’s hard to make a date for the sports bar to get a cold one and watch the Bruins game when the sports bars are overrun with the ravenous walkers and the Bruins were probably eaten months ago.\nPlus there’s Morgan with his whole new sanity and Zen attitude and Rick with his God complex, still trying to decide if he wants to save or sacrifice the residents of Alexandria.\n“I don’t take chances any more,” Rick tells Morgan, but that’s a lie, real­ly, because in this world even deciding to take a nap is a chance.\nDaryl (Norman Reedus) doesn’t agree with all of Rick’s decisions, but he’s willing to go along with them, for now.\nDeanna (Tovah Feldshuh), the titular leader of the gated community, seems in shock, and can you blame her after she watched her husband die at the end of last season? Glenn (Steven Yeun) has the worst taste in best friends. Eugene (Josh McDermitt) can’t even eavesdrop properly. He should take spy lessons from Carol (Melissa McBride), who has everyone — almost everyone — fooled. Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) take a ride, and one of them seems to have a death wish, and it might not be the one you think. Another character from the long-running Robert Kirkman comic book joins the mayhem. One resident of Alexandria might as well be wearing a red shirt and a necklace of chicken McNuggets. I just want to know how mad Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) manages to keep his shirt looking so maddeningly clean.\n“Everybody, keep your heads,” Rick advises at one point.\nOn “The Walking Dead,” easier said than done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:47:23.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
