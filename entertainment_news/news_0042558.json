Of course in this movie he doesn't have a balanced diet and Damon starts to lose weight. This had fans wondering how much weight he had to lose for this movie. On Friday, Bustle shared that Matt Damon actually didn't have to lose any weight for this movie. He was lucky enough that they found another way to do it.\nDamon was actually willing to lose the weight, but he shared in an interview that director Ridley Scott didn't expect him to do it at all. There are other ways around it and so there was no reason to have Matt lose the weight. Damon shared saying \"I talked to Ridley about [losing weight for The Martian] because I’ve lost weight before for movies . We had about six months. And I said, 'That’s perfect. I’ll lose about 30 or 40 pounds, and we’ve got to shoot all that stuff first.' And he went, 'F*ck that.'\"\nThey actually used CGI to make Damon look like he had lost weight. Also, if you have seen \"The Martian,\" Matt Damon is wearing a space suit during a lot of the film so it is harder to tell what he looks like underneath that outfit. They were able to make it look like he lost the weight in his face with makeup.\nMovie Line shared that when Matt Damon did the movie \"Courage Under Fire\" he lost a lot of weight. Damon used a high protein and low fat diet to take it off. He actually lost 41 lbs. and kept it off for drinks. Damon took the weight off with diet, lots of coffee and also running all the time. Luckily Matt Damon didn't have to do this all over again for his role in \"The Martian.\"", "external_links": ["http://movieline.com/1997/03/01/extreme-measures-matt-damon-in-courage-under-fire/", "http://www.bustle.com/articles/112961-how-much-weight-did-matt-damon-lose-for-the-martian-thankfully-the-actors-transformation-was-computer-helped"], "published": "2015-10-04T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T14:44:23.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
