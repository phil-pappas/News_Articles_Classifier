I think he is getting better with age. He is still super hot,\" said Shamita.\nShe is all geared up for Life OK's 'Prem Ki Diwali', where she will be seen in the opening dance act for the promotion of Salman and Sonam Kapoor's 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' on TV.\n\"I am doing the opening act with lamps. I have some interaction scenes with Salman Khan,\" said Shamita.\nThe 'Zeher' actress, who hasn't been doing films for a while, says she is missing Bollywood and has promised that \"you will see me soon on the big screen\".\nThere were rumours about her making a comeback on the silver screen with her sister Shilpa Shettyâ€™s home production.\n\"I don't think that she (Shilpa Shetty) has any production. She is focusing on other things right now, not the production house,\" said Shamita, who prefers a silent Diwali.\n\"Diwali is really a happy time. It's a festival of lights, that's the only time when the entire family comes together and celebrates together. I will celebrate Diwali in a traditional way,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:33.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
