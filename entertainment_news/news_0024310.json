The play by Danai Gurira about how some women might endure captivity and regular rape in squalid, harrowing conditions is currently in the middle of a sold-out run downtown at The Public Theater. It closes there Nov. 29. It then jumps to the Golden Theatre, with previews beginning Feb. 23. Nyong'o (\"12 Years A Slave\") portrays a teenager who finds herself enslaved in a rebel compound during a bloody civil war in 2003 Liberia. A graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Nyongo's stage credits include playing Perdita in \"The Winter's Tale\" and Sonya in \"Uncle Vanya\" both at Yale Repertory Theater. The Mexican-born Kenyan will next appear in the anticipated \"Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens\" and will voice a character in Jon Favreau's take on Disney's \"The Jungle Book.\" \"Eclipsed\" is be directed by Liesl Tommy. It was first produced in 2009 and has been mounted in Washington, D.C., Los Angles, London, South Africa and Zimbabwe. This is the first time it's been in New York. Gurira, an award-winning writer who explores African lives onstage, also plays the katana-weilding walker assassin Michonne on AMC's \"The Walking Dead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:59:39.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
