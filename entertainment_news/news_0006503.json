We are in discussions about its future, but we won’t get into a bidding war.” \nThe source added: “We have made a final bid that we won’t increase. We love the show but we won’t pay inflated prices to keep hold of it. We have made a final two-year bid, and now it is out of our hands.” \nIn the UK, The Voice is produced by Wall to Wall, alongside Talpa Media, the Dutch-based production company behind the format. The series was created by John de Mol. (Wall To Wall/BBC) \nHowever, ITV acquired Talpa Media in a deal worth approximately £355 million. \nThe BBC source continued: “There seems to be some confusion as to who out of the three will decide, which is why some earlier reports have been conflicting.” \nThis statement follows suggestions the BBC were not looking to renew the show’s contract over its £55 million cost.
