The premiere, entitled ‘The Crown of India’, will be held at Emirates Palace Auditorium, with the evening’s programme featuring Beethoven’s 4th Symphony and musical pieces reflecting the Indian arts and culture in Europe. “We are very pleased to open the new Classics season with events organised in cooperation with the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai,” said Ronald Perlwitz, the head of music programme, TCA Abu Dhabi. “With the Symphony Orchestra of India, it is not only one of the region’s main symphonic ensembles that is coming to Abu Dhabi but also a true example of an orchestra with mixed Eastern and Western influences, making it sound so specific and thrilling,” WAM news agency quoted Perlwitz as saying. “We are also looking forward to welcome Aditi Mangaldas and her amazing dance company and of course star poet Gulzar, with whom we will start understanding how music and poetry are inextricably intertwined,” Perlwitz added. Symphony Orchestra, founded in 2006, has rapidly turned into one of the most prestigious in the Indian subcontinent and a major international musical force. It will be led by the Oxford University-educated conductor Zane Dalal. The Mumbai-based orchestra will then travel to Al Ain, the emirate’s heritage heartland, for a second concert at the Municipality Theatre on Thursday (October 8) with a programme offering a panorama of classical music from Bach, Elgar and accompanied by violin virtuoso Marat Bisengaliev. In keeping with this year’s theme of ‘Music and Poetry’ for Abu Dhabi Classics, presented by Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority (TCA, Abu Dhabi), the two concerts will be followed by performances in Abu Dhabi city and Al Ain city by one of India’s most celebrated poets, writers, lyricists and film directors, Gulzar, accompanied by classical vocalist Ajoy Chakrabarty, who will join together in a tribute to the Nobel laureate, poet and composer Rabindranath Tagore. The first performance will take place at Abu Dhabi Theatre on the Corniche on Monday (October 12) followed two days later by a repeat concert at Al Ain’s Municipality Theatre. Between the two shows will be a performance by the Aditi Mangaldas Dance Company – The Drishtikon Dance Foundation with their interpretations of classical Indian dance – Kathak – at Emirates Palace on October 13. Aditi Mangaldas is a leading dancer and choreographer in Kathak, having trained under the leading gurus such as Kumudini Lakhia and Pandit Birju Maharaj.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:08:02.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
