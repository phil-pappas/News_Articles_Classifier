The actor explains in an interview with ComicBook.com how his character who will be introduced first on \" Marvel's Jessica Jones \" will fit into the Marvel universe on Netflix. \"I can tell you what they've allowed me to, which is basically, Luke Cage will take place a few months after Jessica Jones,\" Colter spilled. \"So in real time, if you watch Jessica Jones, you'll find [at the end] Luke Cage uptown in Harlem, working, trying to make ends meet.\" \"Luke Cage really hasn't figured out what he's doing. He's tending bar, he's bouncing around. And for good reason, he's a fugitive, he has some skeletons in his closet,\" he added. \"He's trying to basically stay off the radar. The people he hangs around with, though, are in need. Ultimately, he'd rather be alone, but with the way he's equipped he does step up.\" The actor continued, \"That's what it's about, it's about finding that inner feeling to make you want to take action. Sometimes we just sit around, and sit on our hands and don't do anything because it's like 'hey, that's not my problem.' You can't do that when you're a superhero. You have these gifts, now use them.\" Colter also said, \"So I can say you'll find him uptown in Harlem, and in a completely different world from Hell's Kitchen.\" \"Jessica Jones\" starring Krysten Ritter will premiere on November 20. It's the second of four Marvel superhero shows on Netflix after \" Daredevil \", starring Charlie Cox , debuted earlier this year. Luke Cage and Iron Fist are set to follow before the four of them are brought in together for one ensemble piece, \" The Defenders \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:41:17.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
