After a small headlining tour right after the CD came out, the band started 2015 by opening for Chris Tomlin on a string of spring dates. Now the band is out again promoting the CD on its “All the Earth is Holy Ground” Tour, which visits the Dixie Classic Fair in Winston-Salem on Oct. 7. Sidewalk Prophets and Dan Bremnes will open the 7 p.m. show. “‘All the Earth is Holy Ground’ is actually the last song on the CD, but this particular tour will be our first time playing it live,” drummer Jason Jamison explained in a recent interview. “It’s always a balance trying to mix in newer stuff we want people to hear with the older stuff fans have come to love. But as you release more and more music, that’s a good problem to have.” In addition to Jamison, Tenth Avenue North includes singer Mike Donehey, bassist Ruben Juarez, guitarist Jeff Owen and keyboardist Brendon Shirley. The Dove Award-winning band broke through with “Over and Underneath” in 2008, followed by “The Light Meets the Dark” in 2010 and “The Struggle” in 2012. Though “Cathedrals” is the band’s fourth CD to date, Jamison said it marked the first time the group actually made the entire CD together as a unit. “We never really set out to make a different record than the last one per se, but we’re really proud of this CD, both the songs and production,” Jamison said via phone before a recent tour stop at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. “The biggest difference this time is that we all wrote this record together as a band. It makes it a little more special.” In the past, Jamison said Donehey would bring songs to the table he had written by himself or with other songwriters. But the band worked on the CD while out on the road during a recent Winter Jam Tour, writing songs and music during breaks in the tour. On this current trek, Jamison said Tenth Avenue North plans to perform songs from “Cathedrals” that it hasn’t gotten to play live yet, in addition to “All the Earth is Holy Ground.” That’s how this particular tour will differ from previous outings promoting the latest CD. Jamison said Bremnes will open the show for about 20 minutes, followed by Sidewalk Prophets, who will perform about 45 minutes. As the headliner, Tenth Avenue North will perform about 75 minutes. Page 2 of 2 - “We hope to have a moment or two with all of us on stage together at some point,” Jamison added. One thing that isn’t different this time around is the message and the means used to present it. “Music is fun, people go to concerts to have a good time, and there are certainly moments when we will laugh and carry on. You’re supposed to do that at a concert,” Jamison said. “But at the same time, and this is something that has remained constant for us, music is a tool, and we want to use it to create an environment that’s conducive for people to encounter Christ.” After the Dixie Classic Fair appearance, the tour continues across the country before concluding Nov. 15 in Round Rock, Texas. Jamison said the band may do some sort of Christmas tour, though it actually hasn’t released a Christmas CD yet. Visit tenthavenuenorth.com to keep up with the band’s travels. The Dixie Classic Fair begins Friday and continues through Oct. 11 at the Dixie Classic Fairgrounds, 421 W. 27th St., in Winston-Salem (behind Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum and next to BB&T Field).
