Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (Joe Giddens/PA) \n“It wasn’t such a good night for you last night, because I know you’re an Arsenal supporter, but it was all going so well and then look at what happened last night. \n“Every young lad has a dream of appearing in the FA cup final, and scoring the winning goal, and I was looking at you and the love there was for you in the room, and you were basking in it – was yesterday your FA cup final?” \nThe 12-minute interview rapidly went downhill from there with Eamonn likening Mr Corbyn’s popularity to that of a “religious leader” before more football analogies followed and a long-winded statement about the Labour man’s “caring” persona. \nThe TV star is on social media so our advice is to stay away for today and don’t read the comments. Eamonn had “a shocker” \n— Jack Nield (@JackNield) September 30, 2015 Eamonn Holmes interviewing Jeremy Corbyn was really, really odd http://t.co/oe8fT4hw78 pic.twitter.com/bcVgyzgwFX \n— Chris York (@ChrisDYork) September 30, 2015 Where the hell did Eamonn Holmes go to journalism school?
