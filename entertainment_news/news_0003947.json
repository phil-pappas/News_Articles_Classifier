Neuman, to worry (“Would it help?”).\nHanks’ lawyer is the quintessential Good American, a man who agrees to defend the despised Soviet spy because that’s how we do things here (at least at the time). Donovan manages to upset everyone in his life with his very vigorous­ defense of Abel: his devoted wife Mary (Amy Ryan, dutifully channeling Donna Reed), his boss Thomas Watters (Alan Alda), the police and his Brooklyn neighbors.\nWhen Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured, Donovan is enlisted to negotiate a trade, Powers for Abel, to be completed on the titular Glienicke Bridge in East Berlin. It is a plot worthy of London-born Carol Reed, whose post-World War II Vienna-set classic “The Third Man” was certainly on Spielberg’s mind. Donovan, who catches a bad cold in his shabby, un­heated East Berlin hotel, vies with officers of the KGB and Stasi when it comes to light that an American Yale student (Will Rogers) is being held by the infamous East Berlin secret police. As a powerful East German attorney with shady connections, Sebastian Koch (“The Lives of Others”) is another standout.\nWhile an opening monologue might be a too obvious foreshadowing of the climax, the screenplay by Matt Charman (“Suite Francaise”) and acclaimed filmmaking and screen­writing duo Joel and Ethan Coen is a thing of beauty. At 143 minutes, “Bridge of Spies” flies by on a wave of excitement, gamesmanship, tension and subversive humor. The period detail is impressive (yes, that is Stanley Kubrick’s “Spartacus” playing in an East Berlin cinema), and lensing by brilliant Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski,­ who shot on film, is first rate. Three long years after the monumental “Lincoln,” Spielberg remains at the top of his game.\n(“Bridge of Spies” contains brief profanity and violence.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:57:46.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
