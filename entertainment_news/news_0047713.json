The question now becomes: who is packing their things – the St. Louis Rams, the Oakland Raiders or the San Diego Chargers?\n\"I don't think of this as hammering something out,\" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday outside NFL headquarters in Manhattan. \"The league owns L.A. The league wants, in my opinion, to put the absolute best football that we've ever done, we want to put it in L.A.\n\"We don't need to look at this as a compromise. I think that's the wrong way of looking at this. L.A. needs the best shot we've got.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBell: Nothing hurts NFL more than 'integrity of game' being questioned\nThat means marketability, fans, on-field performance and stadium projects are all up for consideration when it eventually comes down to a vote. But after polling owners who strolled through the league offices Tuesday for the latest round of meetings, there's no clear indication who has the inside track. And even though stadium projects in Carson and Inglewood have gained momentum in the past year, one owner brought up an entirely different possibility.\n\"There is a lot of discussion, because this is a 'once in a lifetime' kind of thing,\" Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA TODAY Sports. \"Everyone wants to make sure it's the right decision and the right set of circumstances. The best solution might be something that's not even presented. There might be Plan C.\"\nStadium construction remains one of the biggest obstacles in finalizing the process. Though Khan's Plan C comment puts a bit of a question mark on the Carson and Inglewood projects, several owners expressed optimism over the amenities and possibilities of the existing projects.\n\"I really think the excitement of coming back and having a new stadium – and the potential that the new stadium are could be kind of like an NFL Disneyland,\" Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said. \"The traction in that is really exciting.\"\nAdded Jones: \"Our No. 1 focus should be a project in L.A. that wows them … we have in place a couple of projects that would do what I'm talking about.\"\nUSA TODAY\nJust how badly are NFL kickers struggling in 2015?\nThe other big question: Which team or teams will make the move?\nAs ownership groups from each of the three franchises continue to make their arguments, the vote by owners likely will come closer to the end of the year. The next significant round of meetings is set to take place in December, and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney said the LA committee's timeline was to make a recommendation after the season.\nRooney, Clark Hunt (Kansas City), Robert Kraft (New England), Bob McNair (Houston), John Mara (Giants) and Jerry Richardson (Carolina) make up the league's Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities.\nBut it's worth pointing out that there's still some disagreement over the process.\nUSA TODAY\nGreg Hardy hopes to come out 'guns blazing' for Cowboys after suspension\nJones said \"no, emphatically no\" when asked if both teams needed to relocate at the same time.\nMcNair, however, refuted that on the grounds that the second team to relocate \"would be at a distinct disadvantage.\"\nAlthough temporary facilities and relocation fees are some of the next hurdles left to be decided, several owners were optimistic about the possibility of at least one team playing in Los Angeles by the 2016 season.\n\"There's a high likelihood, a greater percentage chance, that there will be NFL football out there next year,\" Irsay said. \"It's not a guarantee. We have to make sure it's done right. I think a lot will be determined in the next few months.\"\nThat's music to the ears of several owners.\nJones couldn't help but grin as he discussed the abundance of new revenue streams that would come with the NFL's return to Los Angeles.\n\"If done right, it will raise the values – it will raise the bar of every club associated with the NFL,\" he said. \"I don't want to miss that train.\"\nContributing: Tom Pelissero\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes .\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL Los Angeles in spotlight at NFL owners meetings | 01:36 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero explains everything that happened at the NFL owners meetings Wednesday.
