The initial 26-kit collection ranges from a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and Ford Police Car for the youngest builders to Luke Skywalker's X-Wing Fighter, the Black Diamond Pirate Ship and a Corvette Stingray for kids up to age 12 – all with a new design approach matched to kids' abilities and attention spans.\nNow available at all Michaels stores, the new plastic models provide play value for the youngest modelers, reduce piece counts and build times, and decrease complexity that causes kids to abandon modeling projects. Four new Revell-exclusive product categories introduced in the collection to meet these objectives are:\nSnapTite® Build & Play™ (Skill Level 1 for ages 6-8) – These kits feature 10 to 20 pre-decorated pieces that can be snapped together in less than 30 minutes with no need for glue, paint or tools. They can also be used for play after assembly, thanks to use of safe and durable materials that can withstand handling. These are the first model kits to offer play value at the 6-year-old age rating, which is two years younger than standard. SnapTite® (Skill Level 2 for ages 8-10) – These models include 20 to 45 pre-decorated, snap-together pieces with build times of up to one hour, offering a step up from Skill 1 kits and easy-to-apply customizing stickers to challenge older modelers without presenting a level of difficulty that will discourage involvement. Assembly may require the use of a screw driver, but no paint or glue is needed. SnapTite® Max (Skill Level 2 for ages 8-12) – With 25 to 60 pre-decorated snap-together pieces and the same one-hour build times as SnapTite models, these kits again feature easy snap assembly and customizing stickers while also presenting a bigger challenge for intermediate modelers because of the higher piece counts. Again, assembly may require the use of a screw driver, but no paint or glue is needed. Skill Level 3 for ages 10-12 – These introductory glue kits contain 40 to 70 pre-decorated pieces (up to 50% fewer pieces than traditional glue kits for this age) and require glue and tools for assembly but make paint optional for those who want to add extra creativity, detail and customization. Project time may take up to three hours. The result is an enjoyable first-time glue kit experience that prepares builders for a transition to full glue-and-paint kits available in Revell's existing line of Skill Level 4 and 5 models. In addition, all packaging has been redesigned for easy identification of skill level, target ages and build time on the box front, eliminating confusion on the shelf and simplifying parents' purchase decisions. Box backs show piece counts as well as glue/paint/tool needs, picture other kits in that particular skill level for easy parent selection, and summarize all Revell model skill levels to help parents zero in on the right products for their children.\n\"Model making used to be a kids' hobby, but for years products have been focused on experienced modelers and ignored the changes in the younger market segment. That discourages children and robs them of a fun activity that also helps build fine motor skills, the ability to follow instructions, and a sense of accomplishment as they assemble a replica of a real-world car or truck, historical aircraft, pirate ship or space ship from a favorite movie,\" said Lou Aguilera , Vice President and General Manager, Revell. \"Our new Skill Level 1, 2 and 3 kits are truly geared to kids with a logical skill­­-level progression beginning with Build & Play model kits. These changes give parents a way to engage kids early, encourage continuing involvement in the hobby, and provide a new outlet for their children's energy and creativity.\"\nAvailability\nAll 26 new Revell model kits are available at Michaels stores at prices from $14.99 to $24.99 . Revell will be expanding distribution and continually adding new models beginning in early 2016.\nAbout Revell Inc.\nRevell has been a worldwide leader in scale plastic model kits since 1945.
