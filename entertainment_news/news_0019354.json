He said although Punjab and Haryana contribute large numbers of Kabaddi players, one cannot add more teams based in either of these two states because they do not have a single indoor stadium that could host a Kabaddi match. \"In Mumbai, the game is hosted at the NSCI Dome, but the biggest constraint is the availability of this facility for a reasonably long period of time. One venue for a city with more than 1,000 Kabaddi clubs simply does not make sense. In this case, consumer interest and the ability to invest are no hurdles, but the fact that the sporting infrastructure required is simply non-existent,\" he added. \nStating that the movie business is no different, Gupta said, \"With around 7,000 screens, India has one of the world's lowest screen densities. Despite breakthrough movies such as Queen, PK or Bajrangi Bhaijaan, revenues are stagnant, although the cost of producing these movies has soared dramatically in the past decade. Therefore, a $2 billion industry that sets a billion hearts racing earns zero profits.\" \n\"Television distribution is roughly a third of the total value of the media industry. In the past few years, immense investments have been made in both DTH and the cable business. But the tragedy of this sector is that even after many years of continued investment not a single company or business makes any money,\" he added. \nConcluding his final remarks, Gupta said that there is an urgent need to make distribution profitable, position animation as the next wave of export oriented growth, support a serious scale up of exhibition screens and sports stadiums and allow content innovation in radio.
