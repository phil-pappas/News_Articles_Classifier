That is why I recently found myself on the phone with Rob Clarke, publisher of Roland Park Living, a monthly magazine for and about the affluent Baltimore neighborhood of that name.\nMe: A reader from Roland Park sent me a copy of your magazine. I have it in my hands. It's heavy, like a cinder block! The pages are as thick as roof shingles and as glossy as Granny Smith apples. They overflow with vibrant, full-color ads. You seem to be doing great, and you don't even charge for the product. For the sake of American journalism, I wonder if you can share the secrets of your business model.\nRob: I'm just a small spoke in a large wheel. My parent company partners with neighborhoods across the country to produce high-quality newsletters that are all about the people who live there. We produce something people want to read, about people they know and see on a regular basis, and this attracts businesses that want to reach those same people through advertising.\nMe: Here is what I see: You take money from people to write glowingly complimentary things about them.\nRob: No, no. The residents featured in there don't pay anything.\nMe: They buy ads! In the same issue!\nRob: Oh, yes, that is part of our program.\nMe: This financial-planner guy pictured on the cover, frolicking with his family in the same backyard where he once put up a Ferris wheel for his kid's birthday party -- that guy bought an ad. And this other guy, a Realtor who is identified as your financial \"sponsor\" for the issue, is the subject of a lavishly adoring two-page spread inside. (\"Because he's so familiar with the neighborhood, Maher can readily explain the virtues that make it one of the finest urban residential neighborhoods in the United States.\" \"He is amiable, funny, gracious, smart and talented.\")\nRob: Yes, that was part of the advertising package. \"Sponsor of the month\" is a whole value-added deal. ...\nMe: A few pages later, there's a whole separate story about the same guy's dog!\nRob: Right. We'd usually run them on different months, but he wanted them in the same issue, and that was something we could do, so ... .\nMe: \"When Holly is happy, she likes to lie on her back and wiggle her entire body. Ken thinks it's adorable.\"\nRob:\nMe: I'm not suggesting you are doing anything wrong, but writing about your advertisers is not conventional.\nRob: I can see how this could be misunderstood, but we pride ourselves on dealing only with high-quality businesses.\nMe: So, it's accurate to say good things about them! Makes sense!\nRob:\nMe: I don't know why The Washington Post never thought about this. We could deal only with classy people like Donald Trump and charge them for ads on a sliding scale based on how extravagantly we complimented them in the stories. We'd turn that red ledger book black in no time. Think that would work, Mr. Future of Journalism?\nRob:\nMe: Sorry. That was uncalled for. Experiencing a little bottom-line envy here.\nRob: No problem.\n===", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:26:06.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
