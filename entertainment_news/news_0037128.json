Close Dining in the Dark for a brighter future Sofia Priebe with singer-songwriter Blessing Offor and Lori Woll of Waterford Hotel Group at last year’s “Dinner in the Dark” event. (Photo submitted) Published October 20. 2015 12:01AM Amy J. Barry, Special to The Day \nWhen Laura Manfre and Charles Priebe’s daughter Sofia was born 12 years ago, they had no reason to doubt that she was a healthy baby. But by the time Sofia was 2 or 3 years old, and walking, they realized something wasn’t right. She was having trouble seeing details, and in bright light, she would stumble and fall a lot, even run into trees. \nEyeglasses didn’t help and Sofia’s vision continued to worsen. After years of seeing specialists and ruling out a variety of causes, a diagnosis finally came through, and it wasn’t good. Sofia suffered from a rare degenerative genetic condition called Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) that can eventually lead to total blindness. \n“Most doctors told us there wasn’t much we could do; there was no cure,” Manfre recalls, “and eventually our daughter would lose all her sight, and the best would be that she would retain some perception of light through the end of high school, or if we were lucky, maybe into her 20s.” \nBut it turns out there was a reason to be hopeful. \nThe couple learned about recent research breakthroughs in gene therapy that could eventually lead to a cure for Inherited Retinal Diseases (IRD), including Sofia’s LCA. \nAnd there was something they could do: Help raise money to fund research. \n“In February of 2013 when we got Sofia’s genetic diagnosis, we got a call from the Foundation for Retinal Research asking us to do some fundraising,” Manfre says. “We thought, sure, we could probably raise $1,000 or so with a backyard BBQ fundraiser. We raised $15,000 and thought, ‘Wow, that was easy!’” \nWhile working and raising three kids, Manfre found that she was good at raising funds to support continued gene therapy research for Sofia’s condition. She found that both the online and local community would generously contribute their money, time and talent to the cause. \n“We reached out on social media and did fundraising on Crowdrise,” Manfre says. “We raised about $25,000 that year just by people throwing their own parties. These were strangers, people we didn’t know, in Austria, Costa Rica, Germany and across the U.S,” marvels Manfre. \nShe then decided to do her own event. \n“We got together with Olde Mistick Village, Mystic Ballet and Mystic Art Cinemas and hosted a ballet performance and did a live auction. We raised another $25,000 in one night.” \nBecause of all their rapid success, Manfre decided it was time to do something even bigger for Sofia. \n“We don’t know honestly, if this will ever pay off for her — the research may come too late, but the more we learn across the board, the better it is for everyone,” she asserts. \nLess than one year later, in January of 2014, Manfre founded “Sofia Sees Hope,” a Ledyard-based nonprofit organization that aims to transform the lives of those affected by blindness by generating awareness, raising funds for diagnosis, treatment and cures, as well as supporting affected families with financial assistance for medical-related travel. \n“Sofia Sees Hope” held its first “Dinner in the Dark” fundraiser last year at the Mystic Marriott Hotel & Spa and raised more than $48,000 and will host the event again on Oct. 24 with a goal of $65,000. Guests will enjoy a four-course meal with wine pairings and will be presented with a unique challenge. They will wear blindfolds while dining and will be given hints about what they’re eating. Blindfolds come off for a dessert buffet. \n“We wanted to do something different that connected people with the cause,” Manfre explains. “We worked with the Marriott, and Chef Paul created a special tasting menu last year and will do the same this year. We want people to understand that not everyone can take their blindfold off at the end of a meal, but we also want this to be a fun adventure. \n“People loved it last year,” she adds. \nA light at the end of the tunnel \nDr. George Adrian, founder of the Groton Eye Center, and consultant to the State of Connecticut for patients with low vision and pediatric blinding disorders, is one of Sofia’s doctors and is on the board of the nonprofit as medical advisor —“and just to help,” he says. \nHe is very excited about the potential of gene therapy. \n“With gene therapy, the hope, the intention, is to actually allow a patient’s body to reprogram itself and correct any genetic mutations or abnormalities that are causing the disease,” Adrian says. \nThe eye is where most of the research is starting, he says, and where there is great opportunity. \n“It is more accessible than any other part of the body, and also, since (people) have two eyes, we can study one eye and use the other as a control.” \nGene therapy is a complex subject, but in layman’s terms, Adrian says, “Think of a chain. Everything is correct except two or three links. If we can just splice out defective links and repair them, the chain can function again.” \nAdrian stresses the importance of maintaining guarded optimism, but he can’t contain his obvious enthusiasm. \n“We haven’t cured anything yet, which is why we want to get these fundraisers going to put money into research,” he says. “But what we have already done, for example, is to improve the visual functioning in some patients who are almost completely blind, to see objects, to more safely navigate, to improve their mobility and their visual function in some capacity.” \nAdrian believes the potential is very exciting, and although it may take years of research, the ultimate goal is to reverse the damage of these diseases. \n“Sofia still has a chance,” he continues. “And someday, two parents may even be able to be genetically profiled and if they’re at high risk, we may be able to treat the child in utero and prevent it.” \nAdrian points out that if this gene therapy does work, starting with the eyes, it’s something that might help patients with other genetic problems in which the DNA sequence is faulty, such as hemophilia, and Parkinson’s disease — maybe even multiple sclerosis. \nA regular kid \nManfre explains that Sofia is legally blind; she is a Braille reader, uses a cane, and is very sensitive to light, although in darker conditions she can see shapes and shadows. \nWhen asked how her daughter is coping with her condition, Manfre responds, “Sofia is a regular middle schooler. That’s the best thing I can say. She has incredible strength and courage. She’s not very extroverted about all of this. She’s very thoughtful and sometimes she’ll share what she’s thinking. We talk about it, she knows it’s happening. So she focuses on school. She has friends. She likes to dance. \n“There’s a lot of bad stuff, with what we’ve been handed,” Manfre acknowledges. “I hope this will work for Sofia, but we can still make a difference for others. We’re doing what we can.” IF YOU GO \nWhat: “Dinner in the Dark,” presented by Sofia Sees Hope, a Ledyard-based nonprofit that raises funds to research treatments and cures for blindness caused by Inherited Retinal Disease. \nWhere: Mystic Marriott Hotel & Spa, 117 North Road, Groton \nWhen: Sat., Oct. 24.
