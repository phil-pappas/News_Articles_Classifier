They are polite, well-bred \"suffragettes.\" They are almost invariably depicted waving parasols, chaining themselves to fences, shouting in plummy voices. \nThe mood is comic. That's the history we've been fed on screen, anyway -- and it would be news indeed to the thousand British women who braved police beatings, prison and hunger strikes to win the vote. \n\"Suffragette\" gives them back their activism, and their anger. \nDirected by Sarah Gavron, the British production mostly – except for a few scenes -- avoids the usual, polite, export-ready BBC treatment. The costumes and sets are purely functional. Colin Firth does not appear as some hunky Liberal MP. \nInstead the movie stays with the women – and, for a change, not with the educated, upper-class leaders of the movement (who could still post bail, although many refused). No, it's down in the laundries, and the tenements and the streets with the rank and file. \nThis may not reflect the majority of suffragists. But it does concentrate the drama extraordinarily. \nBecause Abi Morgan's script is then able to focus on so many other issues – not just suffrage but workplace violence (as Cockney girls and women fend off, or try to fend off, bosses) and domestic rights (as they're locked out of their houses or denied custody of their children). \nMeryl Streep is the big name here, briefly appearing as suffrage leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Although her participation is clearly a good deed – born of her interest in equal rights and desire to get the movie made – her arrival is too obviously a movie-star turn. It actually stops the story dead. \nOn the other hand, there's some strong, quiet work by the sometimes eccentricity-prone Helena Bonham Carter. And a marvelously felt, quaveringly emotional one by Carey Mulligan . A sort of Norma Rae of the East End, she's worked, without complaint, in an appalling laundry since she was seven. But drawn into the movement by a co-worker, inspired by Pankhurst, she will finally decide to risk everything. \nWhich is ironic because she truly has nothing. \nIn minimizing the usual scenes that fill this sort of film – terribly awkward breakfasts at the country house, men wagging their chinwhiskers at each other – Gavron finds room for others. Like the way the women quietly help each other. Or a bit of historical foreshadowing as an Anglo-Irish police officer uses hidden cameras and informers against these activists, and then sees them fight back with violence, and martyrdom. \nGavron is no visualist – there are few scenes here that catch us up with their imagery, or energy. At times, in fact, \"Suffragette\" is almost painfully slow – measured, like the drip, drip, drip of rain on a stone. But so is any movement. And if it leaves us not with a simple conclusion, but just the picture of people still marching, still moving forward – well, so is their cause. \nRatings note: The film contains violence, sexual situations. 'Suffragette' (PG-13) Focus (106 min.) Directed by Sarah Gavron. With Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter.
