Part of the national Food Day movement, the school of business and entrepreneurship celebrates by championing good food innovators who are shaping the industry and young people looking to enter it.\nAs former Babson president Len Schlesinger (and his book ) likes to say: Action trumps everything. Babson Food Day was born out of this mindset and continually emphasizes conversation for action.\nEquality trumps expertise.\nWhile Babson may be a school of business, food is everybody’s business. So if you eat food, you are a part of the food industry and belong in Babson Food Day conversations.\nEating is an entrepreneurial act. So Babson Food Day is for eaters. Creating a product or service that contributes to a better food system is an entrepreneurial act. So Babson Food Day is for food innovators, entrepreneurs, and those inside established food businesses. Even the mere act of talking about food , as Boston local food hero Louisa Kasdon can attest, is entrepreneurial.\nA visiting scholar at MIT took an Uber out to Babson this week to attend Community Table . Afterward, he said he was surprised by the seemingly big focus on food. It’s true that Food Sol casts a wide net in services to people working at all points on the food system. But the laser-focus on entrepreneurship never wavers.\nMany conferences leads with the expertise of individuals leading certain segments of agriculture or logistics or retail. Food Sol calls this “data” and it’s certainly important. But for the entrepreneur, it is not paramount to action. Babson Food Day features dot-connectors and doers above everyone else.\nSo if you eat and are willing to be curious, learn, share and dot-connect, then come: Babson Food Day is open to the public, free to attend (lunch is $10), no registration required, come-and-go as you please.\nTribe trumps transaction.\nMost food conferences don’t put the attendee first. They put the data and its holders first. An attendee may pay thousands of dollars in entry fees (depending on the clout of the given roster of speakers) and still wind up in the same position: passive, powerless consumer of data.\nEvent hosts are not trying to mistreat their attendees. But they are building for transactions, not tribes. They are recycling the model where the sage on the stage delivers the data to the uninformed masses. This is an old design from an old century. It’s a design that predates the Internet and mobile technology and the wickedly complex, unpredictable, unregulated, trans-continental networks by which we learn and exchange. The glove no longer fits the hand. Now, everybody knows something, and nowhere is this truer than in food. When it comes to food, every single one of us has perspective and data to share.\nFood tribes , a term this Examiner learned from natural products consultant Bob Burke , rally around some particular eating lifestyle— e.g. raw, vegan, gluten-free. But beyond affection (or revulsion) for certain ingredients, with tribe comes a sense of belonging that Americans – buried in ever-evolving and always cerebral nutrition data – are starving for .\nBy design, Babson Food Day puts the attendees in the driver’s seat. They are not used to it. But boy do they get into it because this is how we learn the stuff that matters: by doing. You will still see some traditional content distribution, but it is there simply to spark conversation to which everyone can add.\nTalk trumps tech.\nBy all means, post gorgeous and exciting content all over Instagram and Twitter at Babson Food Day. But ultimately, this gathering is about connection and conversation at the most human of levels.\nTonight at the Brattle Theater in Harvard Square, Sherry Turkle will talk about her new book on just this topic. At MIT, Turkle studies how we related to our technology and whether or not it facilitates the connections that feed us.\nFor years, this Examiner has maintained that food is the medium for cultivating communities, and through them greater peace, health and happiness. To Babson Food Day, please come and converse.", "external_links": ["http://www.foodsol.org/", "http://www.letstalkaboutfood.com/", "http://cravingboston.wgbh.org/article/20151010/start-ups-and-small-plates-fuel-food-sols-rachel-greenberger", "http://www.louisakasdon.com/about/index.cfm", "http://newhope360.com/node/1050881", "http://www.brattlefilm.org/2015/10/16/sherry-turkle/", "http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/the-lewis-institute/food-sol/Pages/community-table.aspx", "http://www.foodday.org/", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483756-action-trumps-everything", "http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/the-lewis-institute/programs/Pages/babson-food-days.aspx", "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/leonard-schlesinger/4/645/293"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:08:44.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
