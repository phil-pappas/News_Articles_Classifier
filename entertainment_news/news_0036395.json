The first two teams to get all three of their bags in the net won the reward – food and a full barbecue set for the winner; and a similar but smaller setup for the runner-up. However, there was a twist. Only one person from each tribe could compete. Angkor chose Andrew Savage; Jeremy Collins represented Bayon and Terry Dietz competed for Ta Keo. Angkor and Ta Keo emerged victorious. \nIn a particularly grueling immunity challenge, one member from each team was elected a caller, while the others were blindfolded. Using only verbal commands, the caller led the blindfolded castaways to a series of large, heavy puzzle pieces. Once collected, the teams took off their blindfolds and worked together to solve a puzzle. The first two tribes to complete the task won immunity. Bayon and Ta Keo aced the challenge, while Angkor found themselves back at the tribal council for the second straight week. \nBack at camp, Abi-Maria Gomes seemed to be calling the shots, as teammates Jeff Varner and Woo Hwang, aware they were the two most likely to be sent home, each tried to coax her into saving them. \nAt the tribal council, Abi-Maria confirmed it was between Jeff and Woo, and admitted she was torn -- Varner was loyal, but Hwang was stronger. Jeff also reminded Abi that Woo voted for her twice. Before the vote, Woo made one last pitch to be loyal to Gomes. In the end, Jeff was voted off by a three-to-one margin. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
