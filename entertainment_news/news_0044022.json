I certainly have been there.\"\nThis dude needs a reality check https://t.co/adi4RYRXg3\n— Ellen Pompeo (@EllenPompeo) October 8, 2015 You are absolutely right! I certainly have been there https://t.co/3vHte187Em\n— Ellen Pompeo (@EllenPompeo) October 8, 2015 In an interview with Time Out published Wednesday, 47-year-old Craig said he's not looking to return to Bond for a fifth time. \"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists,\" he said. \"No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\"\nCraig appeared as the spy James Bond in 2006's Casino Royale , 2008 Quantum of Solace and 2012's Skyfall . The final installment of the Bond franchise, Spectre , will open Nov. 6.\nCraig advises the future Bond, which rumors say may be anyone from Idris Elba to Tom Hardy to Hugh Jackman , to help make the franchise better than it is now. \"People do not make movies like this anymore,\" he said. \"This is really rare now. So don't be [expletive]...Just make sure you're great. You've got to push yourself as far as you can. It's worth it, it's James Bond.\"\nLike Us on Facebook for more stories from UPI.com Related UPI Stories Bill Cosby deposition in sex assault case to be sealed Daniel Craig, Monica Bellucci steam up Sam Smith's new music video Daniel Craig 'done' with James Bond after 'Spectre'", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/justjared/status/651854065052307456", "https://t.co/3vHte187Em", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/09/ellen-pompeo-daniel-craig-bond", "https://twitter.com/EllenPompeo/status/652143661010980866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://twitter.com/EllenPompeo/status/652170381315305472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "https://t.co/adi4RYRXg3", "http://www.timeout.com/london/film/daniel-craig-interview-my-advice-to-the-next-james-bond-dont-be-shit", "https://twitter.com/EllenPompeo/status/652143661010980866", "https://twitter.com/EllenPompeo/status/652170381315305472"], "published": "2015-10-09T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:32:29.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
