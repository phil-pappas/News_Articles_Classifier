Michael Phillips Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Latest \"Star Wars\" trailer debuts, and we want to use the Force to make Dec. 18 arrive sooner. \nMonday night in the National Football League, the Giants and the Eagles took a halftime break on ESPN so that galaxies far, far away and near, near, nearby could get a look at 130 tempting seconds from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” \n“Nothing will stand in our way,” rumbles Adam Driver, who portrays the masked adversary and super-committed Darth Vader fan in the new trailer. He’s right, of course. Director J.J. Abrams’ franchise reboot doesn’t open until Dec. 18. But already the anticipation of a galaxy-changer, or at least a really good time, has been bolstered by the trailer promising X-wing dogfights and variety of planets plus the return of top-billed Harrison Ford (along with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher). Above all the trailer soars on two mysterious energy forces: the music of John Williams, and a heavy, solemn reverence for The Force (“It’s calling to you. Just let it in”) dovetailing nicely with the trailer’s promise of an arrival THIS CHRISTMAS. \nThe Wrap reported a jump-the-gun ticket melee online Monday night. Sites such as Fandango and MovieTickets.com crashed left and right due to high, rabid demand. Tickets originally were scheduled to go on sale just after the “Force Awakens” trailer completed its halfway airing. But many successfully bought December tickets Monday evening, even before halftime. \nAt one point in the trailer, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega (British actors playing crucial new roles) ask Ford’s Han Solo for confirmation of some old myths they’ve heard about star wars past. “It’s true,” Ford says. “All of it. The Dark Side…the Force…They’re real.” Thanks for the reminder, but we knew that. Now, millions upon millions of “Star Wars” fans have only one question on their minds in the wake of the trailer: Is there any way to make the week before Christmas come a couple of months early this year?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:54:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
