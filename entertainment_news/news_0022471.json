Photo: Channel Seven \nWhen Issa Schultz arrived in Australia from Britain as a teenager in 1995, the biggest quiz show on the box was Sale of the Century . He'd already decided his life goal was to learn everything, so of course he had to watch it, but he found the questions \"a bit too easy, a bit unexciting … Other than enjoying the buzzer speed, I never found myself writing much down\".\nWhat he did learn was the vital role of quiz shows in the history of Australian television, how the networks used them to lock viewers in to one channel for the night.\nThe influence of a great quiz became clear when Channel Nine introduced Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in 1999 and got ratings that kept Nine at number one every week.\nIssa Schultz, centre, with The Chase host Andrew O'Keefe, far right, and the other Chasers. \n\"I liked the traditional format with the three lifelines,\" Schultz told me. \"That was before the internet got big.\nAdvertisement \"Back then, you'd see a question up for good money and you'd be gripped waiting to see what the answer was, because you could not look anything up on the internet.\"\nBut because he could answer most of the questions, he found Millionaire somewhat slow, and when the technology became available, he started recording it and fast-forwarding through the waiting periods. \"I'm a quizzer, I just want to know the questions, and then I move on with my life.\"\nWhen Issa Schultz arrived here from Britain in 1995, the biggest quiz show on television was Sale of the Century . Photo: Channel Nine \nHis lifelong study of quiz rituals paid off in 2009, when he won $200,000 on a show called The Rich List , and again in 2011, 2013 and 2014 when he won the Australian section of the World Quizzing Championship. That brought him to Channel Seven's attention when it was seeking a new format to beat Nine's Hot Seat (the descendant of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ) and deliver a bigger audience to the 6pm news, which had fallen behind Nine's news in some cities.\nSchulz became one of four \"Chasers\" who terrify contestants on The Chase Australia . He has a theory on why The Chase is already getting a bigger audience than Hot Seat after only three weeks on air – it has a speed that is of its time.\n\"With Hot Seat , it's 15 questions in half an hour,\" Schultz says.\nAt first, Issa Schultz was hesitant about being labelled the Supernerd, but says now he's come to embrace it. Photo: Channel Seven \n\"With our show, we've already got through about 20 in the first three minutes. I can understand the need for drama but I think those days of dragging it out for big money are gone.\n\"That was exciting in 2001, before it was possible for viewers to go on their mobile phones and find out the answer. But 15 years later, making someone wait three or four minutes to find out the answer to one question, I don't think that works.\"\nSeven has given Schulz the title \"Supernerd\". How does he feel about that?\nIssa Schultz says he finds Millionaire Hot Seat with Eddie McGuire, centre, rather slow: 'I just want to know the questions, and then I move on with my life.' Photo: Gina Milicia \n\"At first I thought 'Ooh, gosh, no one's ever called me that',\" he says.\n\"I am a little nerdy, but taking that extra step up to supernerd, I thought, \"Oooh, er\". But now I've embraced it.\n\"I look around my house and I'm surrounded by board games, books all over the floor and on the bookcase. Anyone who came over would probably say, 'Yes, you are a supernerd'.\n\"People at work are saying 'Go, Team Supernerd', and they're very supportive, so I'll be quite used to it in the days and weeks to come.\"\nIn real life, Shulz works in the IT department of a bank, but now all his spare time is taken up with anticipating the kind of general knowledge questions that might come up in the show.\n\"My challenge personally as a Chaser is to try and study everything under the sun,\" he says.\n\"The challenge of the question writers – and I don't know who they are – is to try and stump us. I try to brush up on fashion, pop culture, food and drink. My favourite topics are history, geography and literature, and I'm more confident in those areas. I relish that challenge, studying literally every day. My weekends are gone, basically.\"\nIn his studies of the history of Australian quizzing, he found a soulmate in Barry Jones, the schoolteacher who kept winning a show called Pick A Box throughout the 1960s and who went on to become Minister for Science in the Hawke government of the 1980s.\n\"Apparently he never lost and he would contradict some of the answers,\" Schultz says enviously.\n\"The host, Bob Dyer, would say, 'The answer's this…' and Jones would say, 'Well, actually, it's this…' and it would turn out Barry was right.\"\nDoes Schultz fantasise about contradicting The Chase host Andrew O'Keefe when the question-setter gets an answer wrong? He admits he'd be too timid.\n\"I wouldn't be able to do that on camera. I'm naturally a very laid-back person. When I went to trivia nights from '95 onwards, I was never the one to interrupt the host and say, 'That's wrong'. I would have felt rude. I might go home, research it and maybe mention it politely the next week, even if a prize was a stake.\"\nThe Chase Australia airs each weekday at 5.30pm on Seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:39:02.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
