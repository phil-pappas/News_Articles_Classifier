The whole concept is not what you think it is.”\nThe filmmaker discusses five ways The Final Girls takes a machete to conventional slasher fare:\nIt has a whole lot of heart\nThe movie is a very personal one about grief and missing one’s parents: High school senior Max (Taissa Farmiga) is reticent about attending an anniversary screening of Camp Bloodbath with her friends — the film starred her mother Amanda (Malin Akerman) in her acting heyday, and Max still grieves losing her in a fatal car accident.\nBut accidentally getting stuck in retro landscape of the film gives Max a way to see her mom again, even though she, her friends and the in-movie camp counselors have to survive when the murderous masked man Billy Murphy gets bloodthirsty every time a teenager has sex.\nUSA TODAY\nGet ready for the metal-est of horror comedies\nJoshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin’s Final Girls script was written with parents in mind — Miller’s father Jason, who died in 2001, played Father Karras in The Exorcist — and they sent it to Strauss-Schulson, who when read it at a time when he was dreaming about his late father every night.\n“This was about a girl who gets a second shance to see her dead parent in like a death dream,” Strauss-Schulson. “That’s why the movie looks how it looks: a hypercolor, surreal, very beautiful, very strange dream.\n“It was such a smart idea to tell a really sober story about death and grief and the reverbs of that in the middle of a horror movie that doesn’t take death very seriously.”\nThere’s actually good acting\nThat kind of conceit needed some serious talent to play the mother/daughter relationship, and Akerman and Farmiga’s casting was key to the movie’s success, according to Strauss-Schulson.\nWhile Camp Bloodbath characters like horny Reagan-era jock Kurt (Adam DeVine) and resident sexpot Tina (Amanda Trimbur) needed to be broad and ridiculous, the director wanted Farmiga to exude a certain ethereal fragility and melancholy in those same scenes with the more over-the-top characters.\nENTERTAIN THIS!\nNina Dobrev says heartfelt farewell to 'Vampire Diaries' fans\nMax seeing her mom for the first time in the movie-within-the-movie still gets to Strauss-Schulson. “I know I made it but when I watch it, I get the chills and it’s because it’s the two of them,” says the director, adding that Akerman has the hardest job in the flick.\n“She has to play a two-dimensional character who gets in touch with the idea that she has mortality, that maybe she’s not real and maybe she might not live forever. She almost has the biggest journey in the movie.”\nA group of kids get stuck in a 1980s horror movie in \"The Final Girls.\" Sony Pictures\nNo archetype goes untouched\nStrauss-Schulson takes the stock characters of a slasher movie and uses their essential traits to give them more dimension: For example, the mean girl (Nina Dobrev) gets the chance to explain why she’s mean, and the only person who actually comes out and says they’re afraid is the hunky heartthrob (Alexander Ludwig).\n“They all touch their mortality or they all have almost a moment of consciousness like Johnny Five in Short Circuit,” says Strauss-Schulson.\nOne of his favorite moments is when Kurt meets one of the real-life kids who says he has two gay dads, and the jock’s dim ‘80s mind can’t process it at first.\n“He’s like, ‘Gay guys can’t have kids! They’re too busy going to discos and having sex with each other!’ And when he says it’s a pretty cool lifestyle, this guy is getting conscious,” Strauss-Schulson explains. “You can take a person who would seemingly be this homophobic, outrageous lunatic, and you can give him that really modern progressive spin.”\nMax (Taissa Farmiga) faces off with masked villain Billy Murphy in \"The Final Girls.\" (Photo: Sony Pictures)\nIt boasts an obscure and wide range of influences\nSummer-camp horror movies were a big subgenre back in the day, and while The Final Girls pulls some from Sleepaway Camp and Friday the 13th , the 1981 cult movie The Burning is a huge reference in the music as well as the look of killer Billy Murphy.\nUSA TODAY\nLaughs thrive in Halloween scream season\nBecause Strauss-Schulson was a film nerd from a young age, he feels the language of his movie cribs from his favorite horror movies. “There’s a little bit of Sam Raimi in there in terms of some of the camera work and there’s color swatches like Dario Argento,” he says. “There’s one sequence in particular that feels like a (Brian) De Palma scene on steroids.\n“It’s like a fun drinking game to go through the movie and see what you can catch.”\nThe movie itself is a main character\nBilly may be the guy wielding the weapon, but in Final Girls the world of Camp Bloodbath is a major antagonist for Max and her friends. It doesn’t let any of the kids leave until they’ve dealt with Billy, title credits are actual objects that characters interact with and step on, and when a flashback happens in one of the cabins, the whole room turns into a literal watery dissolve.\n“We wanted it to be very emotional but some of the real fun of the film was those visual gags,” Strauss-Schulson says. “I always love in movies when the imagery and the filmmaking can also be getting laughs, not just the improv.”\n12 CONNECT 55 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1LlUi3X TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LlUi3X&text=Five%20ways%20%27Final%20Girls%27%20breaks%20slasher%20mold&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799906047433146-the-final-girls-FG-01332-rgb.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a1c94927e02d31fa84b0dae4ebb65ece9613b12e/c=2096-0-5485-3389/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774089731112453-XXX-SGZA-01840R-MOV-DCB-74910150.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gty_484274670.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487062001_4545377809001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1LlT8FH", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b35a8705fd936ebdfe8c85b6a8b949396b2e4528/c=851-674-2515-1925&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799906047277145-the-final-girls-FG-07757-rgb.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487034001_4545452192001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487033001_4545452192001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487033001_4545452192001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487033001_4545452192001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487062001_4545377809001-vs.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LlUi3X", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LlUi3X&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LlTfRz", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0135e06309170087012dd5e1422562535cb36b48/c=138-0-2801-2002&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799906047433146-the-final-girls-FG-01332-rgb.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487063001_4545377809001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24c8f46923428c619cf24c3781b26de12f583899/c=227-0-1624-1397/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793133531515731-DG6.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799906047433146-the-final-girls-FG-01332-rgb.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4545487062001_4545377809001-vs.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:46:07.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
