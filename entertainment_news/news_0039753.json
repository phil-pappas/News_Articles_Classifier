Khloe Kardashian 's ex-husband was taken into a hospital as some liquid came out of his nose and mouth. Multiple sources at the brothel told the website that Lamar arrived there on Saturday. The 35-year-old basketball athlete reportedly partied up with girls at the Love Ranch for days. One source noted that the \" Khloe & Lamar \" star took a herbal subsitute for Viagra. Regarding the incident, the owner of the brothel, Dennis Hof, told the website that a staff member found Lamar unconscious in his VIP suite. The staff member was horrified and screamed for the manager. The manager on duty then called 911. When the manager rolled Lamar over on his side, he saw \"mucus-type liquid coming out of his nose and mouth.\" Lamar was then taken to Pahrump hospital where the doctor intubated him. The ranch staff was not allowed to stay in the room with the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star because they're not family. Lamar didn't bring his friends and entourage while partying at the ranch and he's now alone at the hospital. TMZ previously reported that due to his severe condition, Lamar was soon flown to a Las Vegas hospital for more treatment. However, a new update from Nye County Sheriff's Department said that he \"was stabilized and transported to Desert View Hospital arriving at 4:16 P.M.\" He wasn't airlifted to Las Vegas \"due to his stature.\" Sources told the website that Khloe, Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner were heading to Las Vegas after learning of the news. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:11:45.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
