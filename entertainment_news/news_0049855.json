By JUSAK YANG BERNHARD AND JEFF MANLEY As humans, we hear much about the risk of diabetes and how the disease has become a growing epidemic.\nWhat is not as widely known is how diabetes is increasing among pets. It is estimated that one in 200 dogs will develop the disease.\nDiabetes is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. The digestive system breaks food into components carried by insulin. When insulin is not produced or cannot be utilized, blood sugar levels become elevated beyond normal safe levels. High blood sugar levels, known as hyperglycemia, when not treated can cause health problems for our pets such as cataracts and urinary tract problems.\nThe type of diabetes classification is the same for us and our four-legged friends. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas is incapable of producing or secreting adequate levels of insulin, a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough insulin.\nLike humans, pets with Type 1 diabetes are given insulin injections, may need changes made in their diet and may need to lose weight. Pets with Type 2 diabetes will typically not need insulin injections as the disease can usually be controlled with diet, weight loss, and oral medication.\nThe most common form of the disease in dogs is Type 1 while Type 2 diabetes is characteristically found in cats. Knowing the symptoms of diabetes in pets can be helpful in determining whether or not you need to seek further advice from your veterinarian. These symptoms include a change in appetite, excessive thirst and excessive increase in water consumption, an increase in urination, weight loss, lethargy, dehydration, cataract formation, chronic skin infections and sweet smelling breath.\nFortunately, diabetes treatment for animals has made huge strides. Blood work, urinalysis and physical examinations can be performed to determine the treatment and therapy for your pets, including whether insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. For female cats and dogs with diabetes, spaying is necessary as female sex hormones can have an effect on blood sugar levels. Some breeds may also run a greater risk, such as standard and miniature schnauzers, poodles, golden retrievers and Australian terriers.\nYour veterinarian will show you how to monitor your pet’s glucose level and home insulin injections. Modern medicine has made caring for a diabetic dog or cat quite doable and certainly worthwhile. Diabetes can be managed successfully with attention to diet and exercise and insulin therapy. Maintaining a regular exercise routine will help maintain your pet’s weight.\nAlthough the cause of diabetes is still unknown, obesity plays a major role in its development. Just like humans, nutrition has much effect on pets becoming diabetic. Expanding our knowledge on pet nutrition can be quite helpful, to further help with what the veterinarians have prescribed.\nPlease be on the lookout for cheap fillers such as corn, wheat and soy, as well as the amount of sugars that are in many pet foods. As carbohydrates also convert into sugars, look for dry foods with lower carbohydrate content. In general, foods with the lowest carbohydrate content exhibit a lower glycemic index.\nSince most kibbles are carbohydrate based, low-carb canned foods should be given serious consideration when selecting dietary options for diabetic pets. Also be aware of the glucose levels in the treats you are rewarding your pets with.\nJusak Bernhard and Jeff Manley are owners of TailsSpin Pet Food & Accessories.
