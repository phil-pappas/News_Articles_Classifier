Selena Gomez proved yet again that she is very much a grown-up as she deftly handled chatting about boyfriends and being fat shamed on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Friday.\nUntil that is DeGeneres gave the singer two little scares and Gomez screamed.\nKnowing Gomez is an easy mark when it comes to being startled DeGeneres had a man, dressed up as Taylor Swift, pop up out of a cabinet on set. A few moments later, a burly bearded guy, tiptoed out in as Elsa from “Frozen” and scared her -- well, he was pretty silly looking.\nThe 23-year-old singer acknowledged that she would have preferred to have kept private her diagnosis of lupus, an autoimmune disease, but seemed accepting that the news had leaked out.\n“I think it was just very complicated because I didn’t understand and then that was something that I did want to keep private until my whole life suddenly wasn't private,” Gomez said.\nDeGeneres showed a photo of Gomez in a pink bikini, which had sparked nasty comments with people calling her fat.\n“But it was weird because it’s not just, ‘Oh, she’s fat’,” Gomez said. “It’s like, ‘She’s a mess. She’s gone off the deep end.’ I’m like because I’m on a vacation wearing a bathing suit? Actually technically that is a little too small for me, but I didn't care.”\nDeGeneres praised her for sending out another photo in a bathing suit and owning the situation.\n“Yes, you can always have the last word if you choose to,” DeGeneres said. “I mean sometimes we don’t want to address these things because there are so many lies out there.”\nMichael Rozman/Warner Bros Selena Gomez reacts to this man, dressed as Elsa from \"Frozen\" when he tiptoed next to he and scared her on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\" DeGeneres then moved onto more pressing matters, such as why is Gomez in Taylor’s squad and she is not. Gomez explained she'’s known Swift a long time, and suggested DeGeneres might need to be able to bake to be part of the squad.\n“So let's talk about your boyfriend,” DeGeneres said.\n“I have a boyfriend?” Gomez asked.\nShe confirmed she is dating, though nothing is serious, then added that this was becoming a stressful conversation.\n“I know, I know we should be drinking while we talk about boys,” DeGeneres said.\nRelated Stories Selena Gomez reveals lupus diagnosis Selena Gomez stuns on magazine cover Selena Gomez opens up about Justin Bieber, new album Tags: selena gomez , the ellen degeneres show , ellen degeneres", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:18:31.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
