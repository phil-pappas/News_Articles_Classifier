The fun was part of a make-it-yourself scarecrow activity organized by Boy Scout Troop 60 from St. Charles.\nElizabeth carried \"Emily,\" a female scarecrow decked out in a brown onesie decorated with pink pigs. \"She's sleeping,\" Elizabeth said of her new friend who eats \"fruit and vegetables.\" Nathan's scarecrow, less showy in jeans and a gray shirt, was named \"Gabriel.\"\n\"I had heard about (Scarecrow Fest) but I didn't expect it to be so huge,\" mom Tiana Holz said. \"This is wonderful and the weather is beautiful.\"\nAlong with checking out more than 150 scarecrows, visitors listened to live music, had a thrill with carnival rides, strolled around a craft fair, and toured the Mobile Coca-Cola Museum along with sampling specialty soda pop.\nBut it was Indian Ridge Farm's petting zoo that grabbed the attention of many young festivalgoers.\n\"Trucker,\" a massive sulcata tortoise, was just fast enough to keep up with the toddlers and preschoolers who beamed as they petted his burnished shell, including Tess Malone of Geneva.\nDespite Trucker's charms and getting a kick out of a curious llama, Tess picked a sheep as her favorite -- \"he's so fluffy.\"\nThe Scarecrow Festival, sponsored by the Greater St. Charles Convention and Visitors Bureau, runs 10 a.m. through 5 p.m. Sunday in downtown St. Charles, along Main Street between Fifth and Second streets. Parking is tight but a free shuttle service is available.
