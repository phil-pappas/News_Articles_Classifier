All I want to do is move on.\"\nAdvertisement Appearing ungrateful for the opportunity to play Bond, Craig said being the famous spy was \"a drag\" and that he 'didn't give a f---' which actor played Bond after him.\n'Look, I don't give a f---. Good luck to them! All I care about is that if I stop doing these things we've left it in a good place and people pick it up and make it better. Make it better, that's all.'\nDaniel Craig in 2012's Skyfall . \n\"If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money,\" he said.\nAfter totally flaming the 60-year-old franchise, executives at Sony reportedly told the actor to \"shut up\" and stop bashing Bond.\nOn Twitter, Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo criticised Craig, telling her followers: \"this dude needs a reality check\".\nDaniel Craig arrives at the \"Skyfall\" Australian premiere in Sydney, Australia. Photo: Brendon Thorne \nAccording to a report by the   New York Post , Craig's fiery interview was off the back of a tough Spectre shoot in which the actor injured his knee and needed surgery.\n\"It was a very difficult shoot, to say the least,\" a source is quoted as saying.\n\"Craig is pretentious and thinks he's better than Bond, that it doesn't give him the creative range he needs.\n\"Plus he hasn't had a big hit movie outside of the franchise, and he blames that on Bond.\"\nWhen asked if he had any advice for the next actor to play James Bond, Craig had some harsh words.\n\"Don't be shit. You've got to step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is really rare now. So don't be shit.\"\nFor such as rare opportunity, it's a wonder Craig doesn't have anything nice to say.\nThis dude needs a reality check https://t.co/adi4RYRXg3 \nâ€” Ellen Pompeo (@EllenPompeo) October 8, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:27:46.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
