Maniacal 4 will perform at 7:30 p.m. at the Roland Fine Arts Center on the campus of HLGU. Without a season or patron membership, tickets are $20 for adults and $5 for students at the door. Maniacal 4 is a group of four great musicians telling one unified, inspiring musical story. They have played concerts on three continents, entertaining audiences with a wide range of styles and time periods. Well versed in classical, jazz, Latin and rock music. With all four members early in their musical careers, Maniacal 4 has the goods to become one of the finest trombone quartets performing today. Following Maniacal 4's live performances of “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Carry On Wayward Son” during classical recitals at major international trombone festivals, the quartet went viral on YouTube, reddit and wimp.com , launching them into a new and exciting phase of their innovative quartet career. Both season and single ticket sales will be available at the door prior to the concert. Season tickets (which include admission to all series performances) are available for individuals ($50) and couple/parents w/children ($100).
