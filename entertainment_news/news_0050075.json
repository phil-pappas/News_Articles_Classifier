Before dropping it on Thursday, October 1, the singer previewed the ballad a few weeks ago in a trailer for the film starring Julianne Moore and Ellen Page . The track starts with Cyrus showcasing her signature vocals over the slow-tempo piano before delivering the powerful chorus, \"In the hands of love, we carry home stronger than we started/ We're ashamed of the trail behind us weakest is the blinded/ Who we are comes alive.\" \"Hands of Love\" was penned by Linda Perry who said in a chat with TIME last month that she wrote it in her car immediately after watching the movie. \"I've never had this happen before,\" she shared. \"The arrangement is there, the lyrics are showing up, I can't get to a piano, there's no instruments, there's no nothing - it's all just floating around inside my head.\" Meanwhile, it's Page who suggested to have Cyrus record the tune. \"She has a really raw, unique, awesome, beautiful voice, and Miley's doing a lot of incredible things for the LGBTQ community,\" the actress explained. \"I just thought it was going to be a perfect fit. She and Linda made something really special. I kept listening to it after I heard it.\" \"Freeheld\" is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on October 2. The movie centers on real-life lesbian couple Laurel Hester (Moore) and Stacie Andree (Page) as they fight for the rights to transfer Hester's police pension benefits to Andree after Hester's tragically diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:17.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
