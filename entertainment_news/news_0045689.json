I used to chuck it out because I used to think it was funny on TV, or it's what they wanted on TV, it's not, we're dealing with girls who are 16.\"\n\"Determination is really key,\" Hawkins said, \"because the industry can knock the girls down.  Persistence, dedication, a good work ethic, they need all of that beyond what they look like because what they look like is essential.\"\n\"You have to be able to cope with rejection,\" said Perry, \"life is like that, just take it on board and try harder, so that you can make the success happen.\"\n \nWhen all is won and done… Virgin Australia AFL grand final party, Alumbra \nSure, you're fine now, the season doesn't really feel over yet and the post-mortem will go on for days but in about a week it will hit . . . there's no footy.  Months and months of no footy. At the Virgin Australia AFL grand final party at Alumbra on Wednesday we wondered, will you be devastated when you realise the season is really over or will you be OK? \nMegan Washington was going to be totally fine. \"In my off season I do lots of yoga and lots of reading and lots of flying, I travel a lot,\" she said. \"I try to go somewhere I never have, somewhere amazing and new. I'm going to Samoa in December, I've never been, and then I'm going to Cuba in April just because I want to sing the song - 'Take me to the April sun in Cuba' \" - which she then proceeded to do. \n\"I will be OK,\" Lisa Hamilton said. \"I will be devastated,\" said Danny De Sanctis . \"I will go into a coma and wait for pre-season. I'll be OK next week because it's still sort of the aftermath, I'll be OK and then I'll be asleep after that.  From mid-October I'm in a hole, I'm gone.\" And Hamilton? \"I'll be at the races.\"\n \nThe comedy debate on a role Grand final comedy debate, Crown Palladium \n\"That football players are role models not male models.\"  Would you argue the affirmative or the negative?  On Thursday at the grand final comedy debate, presented by the Essendon Women's Network and benefiting Liptember, comedians Celia Pacquola and Dave Hughes were on the affirmative. What is your most compelling argument? \n\"Well, Cameron Ling, I think,\" Hughes said.  \"He's a role model but not necessarily a male model. I love Cameron but I'm just saying it's too easy for pretty footballers to get into trouble. The ones with more rugged appearances are the ones we need to follow, they've had to develop more; I know what that's about, I put myself in that category by the way, so don't think I'm being nasty, I'm not making judgments.  If you can't just rely on your looks possibly you're a more rounded personality and possibly that's who the young people should follow.\"\n\"We all try to emulate footballers, even me,\" Pacquola said.  \"I can find things about footballers that I want to emulate.\"  Like?  \"Like running more . . . and they're confident wearing shorts and, you know, if I went out and all of my friends were wearing the exact same thing as me to not be self-conscious about that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:39:51.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
