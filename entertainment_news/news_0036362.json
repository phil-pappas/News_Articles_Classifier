As premise for a rom-com movie, it does have a lot of possibilities for comedy and drama.\nHowever, the line that separates truth from fiction has been blurred a little when the phrase lends itself as title of a film that stars the not-quite-couple-but-nearly-there Tom Rodriguez and Carla Abellana; and happily not-so-single actors Bangs Garcia, and Mike Tan.\nConsider this bit of irony: “No Boyfriend Since Birth” (“NBSB”) stars Tom and Carla, who have already admitted to dating each other. More so, both have also been with other people before – he with singer-actress Kaye Rivera; she with actor Geoff Eigenmann for some four years.\nSupporting cast members Mike and Bangs have already been in relationships before with their respective non-showbiz partners, too.\nSo they’re not exactly the people with whom the film speaks, but there are countless individual who can easily relate. After all, finding love – and keeping it – has always been a human preoccupation. And stories of love will always rate highly among those seeking for meaningful connections.\n“NBSB” stars Carla as Karina, a young woman who has never had any romantic relationship with a guy. She gets infatuated with her high school crush Carlo (Tom), and dreams of spending “forever” with him.\nThe ballad of TomCar\nCarla and Tom were previously on GMA’s “My Husband’s Lover” (2013) and in “My Destiny” (2014), and the 2014 rom-com flick “So It’s You.”\n“Namimiss ko si Tom na makatrabaho at makasama sa set… Lalo na ’yung ’pag nakikita ko siya ’pag madaling araw hanggang umaga, na kami pa rin ’yung magka-eksena, ’yung mga ganu’n,” Carla said.\nCuriously, if a tad sweetly, Carla feels a tinge of “envy” now that Tom has been paired off with Megan Young on “Marimar.”\n“Bilang s’yempre mas madalas silang magkasama dahil magkatrabaho sila ngayon, mas marami silang eksena, kaya naiiisip ko: ‘Buti pa si Megan, mas nakakasama niya si Tom,’” she related.\nTom, on the other hand, said he wouldn’t take too well seeing Carla paired with another guy, to the point he would wish, “Ako ’yung katrabaho niya, ’yung nangungulit sa kanya ’pag nagme-makeup siya, ’yung ’pag lampas alas dose (ng madaling araw) na, magbabatuhan na ng corny jokes…”\nHe added, “Kaya kung sino man ang makakatrabaho niya, sana alagaan siya kasi sa totoo lang naiinggit ako sa magiging posisyon niya.”\nAfter shooting the scenes in “NBSB,” Carla realized there’s still “kilig” factor between her and Tom. “Working with him, ’pag nakaka-eksena ko siya, seeing him every time sa set, meron pa din. Kaya nga sabi ko, dapat alagaan namin nang mabuti ’yung chemistry (na meron kami), at ’yung working relationship namin kasi sayang, eh,” said Carla.\nDespite their obvious affection for each other, fostered since their “My Husband’s Lover” days, Carla and Tom still opt to not put any labels on their “special” relationship.\nCarla insisted, “Super gusto namin alagaan talaga (ang meron kami) at bantayan nang maigi para hindi mapangunahan, ma-preempt.”\nIn past interviews, Tom said Carla is “very special in (his) life,” and with that, he’s just “happy” with whatever he has with the actress. He also said he “wants to cherish and protect it (relationship)” by not rushing things between them.\n“Whatever we have, we understand each other very, very well. Like, nothing has to be planned and nothing has to be intentionally done… It’s contextual – every decision we make will be based on whatever happens,” said Tom.\nAs for Mike and Bangs, both said they’re now ready to settle down with their respective partners.\nMike has a girlfriend of 10 years, while Bangs has been in a relationship with Lloyd Birchmon for almost a year.\n“Lagi naming napapag-planuhan ’yun, ang tanong lang eh kung kailan siya i-e-execute. We’re both ready na, so… in God’s time,” said Mike.\nBangs, who is in a long distance relationship with London-based Lloyd, admitted she once thought relationships between two people who are far apart would not work. She now believes otherwise. “When you’ve found the one, you’ll fight for it,” she said.\nBangs first met Lloyd in Boracay. She will visit him in London for the second time next month.\n“No Boyfriend Since Birth” is a Regal Entertainment film derived from the Wattpad story of the same title by Noreen Capili. It opens in cinemas nationwide on Nov. 11. (With report from Jojo P. Panaligan and Christine Allaine B.
