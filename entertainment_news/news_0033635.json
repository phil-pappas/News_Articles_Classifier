Comment Subscribe to Newsletter! \nMany believe it to be a miracle. \nLast Friday, former NBA Lakers player Lamar Odom gained consciousness after almost a week in Sunrise Memorial Hospital, Las Vegas and was reported to have had the ability to speak with estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, according to Yahoo Sports . Like Us on Facebook \nThe spokesperson for Odom's maternal aunt, Alvina Alston, gave the latest development on Odom's health: ''He woke up, and he spoke,'' as per Yahoo Sports. The publicist also confirmed that Odom spoke a \"greeting\" and gave a thumbs up. She, however, refused to affirm or deny whether the former NBA star has the ability to breathe on his own or whether he talked some more. \nWidely known as a former NBA player for the Los Angeles Lakers, Odom has two championships under his belt and a reality show to match. Now separated, Kardashian and Odom got married in 2009 and had their own \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" spin-off titled \"Khloe and Lamar.\" \nHowever, these didn't last for long, as he eventually signed off playing professional basketball and his and Kardashian's divorce is awaiting final court decision. They had been living separately since the divorce was filed. \nLast Tuesday afternoon, Odom was found unconscious, facedown, and foaming from the nose and mouth at the \"Love Ranch\" -- a Vegas brothel in Crystal, Nevada, as told by The LA Times . Authorities reported that the former NBA player had taken cocain, alcohol and about ten doses of herbal Viagra during his four-day stay at said brothel. Odom's substance spree, has been approximately valued at $75,000, as per The LA Times. \nUSA Today clarifies, however, that there has been no formal statement with regards to Odom's medical condition. \nKardashian was reported to have rushed to the hospital that night following his confinement. She had been making medical decisions for Odom, since then, as his legal wife. Odom's former coach, Jim Harrick reveals, as per Yahoo Sports, that Odom showed a response when Kardashian told his former husband, ''Lamar, I love you.'' Kardashian also said in a phone call to Harrick that Odom is now off dialysis. \n''He's one of the most wonderful, kind, humble and generous human beings you'd ever want to meet,'' Harrick said in a statement, as told by Yahoo News. \nAside from the Kardashians, Odom's former Clippers teammates Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and Chris Paul went out of their way to visit having arrived late Wednesday night in Vegas post-exhibition game in China. \"He probably has no idea we were there, but just to be there and to see him -- hopefully he knows there's a lot of guys that love him and want to see him do better and want to see him get better,\" Griffin said in a statement before the Clippers' Saturday practice, as per The LA Times. \nAccording to The LA Times' sources who wished to keep their anonymity, Lakers star Kobe Bryant and General Manager Mitch Kupchak also visited Tuesday night following the incident. \nTo respect Odom and his family's privacy, the Kardashian clan decided to postpone all app activities, as reported by Yahoo Sports: \"As a family, we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar.\" \nKardashian has also, notably, committed to remaining with Odom until he completely recovers. \n''Khloe has promised me she's going to stay by his bedside until she and him can walk out of the hospital together,'' Harrick said, as quoted by Yahoo Sports.
