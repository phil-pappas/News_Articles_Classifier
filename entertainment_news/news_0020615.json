In self portraits she usually wore traditional dress, including elaborate and unusual hair styles.\nKahlo was devoted to Rivera, a socialist mural-painter and womaniser who she married, divorced and remarried.\nThe paintings in the exhibition, titled Frida And Diego, are drawn from the famous Gelman Collection in Mexico City.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?
