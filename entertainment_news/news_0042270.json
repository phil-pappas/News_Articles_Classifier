After sequels and a spin-off, Ghost Dimension is said to be the final instalment. It is closely related to the third film and its characters, and it has a resolution of sorts, a kind of closure that leaves open the faint, uncalled-for possibility of future movies.\nAdvertisement Ghost Dimension introduces us to Ryan Fleege (Chris J. Murray), his wife, Emily (Brit Shaw) and their young daughter, Leila (Ivy George). Ryan and his goofy brother, Mike (Dan Gill), searching their new home, find a box that contains a mysterious custom-built video camera and a collection of VHS tapes from the late 1980s: these are scenes from or related to the third film. As they're checking out the tapes, they start to notice strange behaviour from Leila. She's not just restless and fixated on an unseen friend – Toby, a familiar entity from past films – she's also burying rosaries and burning Bibles. \nThe Fleeges start using the video camera themselves, realising that it makes paranormal phenomena visible amidst the Christmas decorations, fairy lights and religious motifs. As is often the case in found-footage horror, technology – retro and glitchy though it is in this case – seems somehow implicated in the haunting, beyond the unsettling things it records. At one point, the videos appear to predict what is happening to the family, and it looks as if Leila is interacting with them. \nGhost Dimension is directed by Gregory Plotkin, making his feature debut; he's an editor whose credits include four previous PA films. He's well equipped therefore to tie up loose ends and preside over some kind of resolution, but it all happens in a rather ham-fisted way.\nThe movie is bogged down in explication, background and joining the dots, in a feedback loop of found footage and footage of people filming themselves watching found footage, augmented by a succession of thumps, bumps and apparitions depicted in the muddy depths of night. The family dynamic has little to offer: there's not much of interest in the relationship between Ryan and Emily, nothing that gives the film any additional resonance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:20:15.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
