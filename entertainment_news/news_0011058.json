They were playing some of the best teams in the conference, and the Bears are not in their league.\nBut then, this season has always been about learning who can play for this new coaching staff and will be here when the Bears contend next.\nYears of bad drafting have killed this roster. Only years of good drafting can restore it.\nBut some players on this roster will be around when the Bears are no longer in the conversation for the top overall draft pick, and the weekly plan is learning who they are and who has a helmet for no apparent reason.\nIt’s not even learning how certain individual players can win games. It’s just how they can win a play and maybe several.\nLike Pernell McPhee, Jarvis Jenkins and Eddie Goldman. They produced pressure, sacks and big stops against the Raiders. Just like a big-boy defensive line.\nThen there was Tracy Porter. Watching the cornerback cover Amari Cooper and hold the Raiders terrific rookie wide receiver to one catch, you see how far Kyle Fuller has to go.\nBut then, Fuller made a big play, slamming into Mychal Rivera on third-and-4 at the 11, jarring the ball loose and forcing the Raiders to settle for a field goal instead of starting first-and-goal. The final score tells you how big a play that was.\nHere’s the thing about watching the Bears cornerbacks this week: The Chiefs don’t throw TDs to receivers.\nThe Chiefs went the entire 2014 season without hitting a wideout for a TD and have just one in four games this season.\nIf the Bears secondary gets beat by a wideout for a score, then don’t come home. Stay in Kansas City. Eat some Gates Bar-B-Q. Watch the Royals. I don’t care what you do. Just don’t come home. Standards, people.\nBut there is a Chiefs player who catches TDs --- catches everything ---and this means trouble for inside linebacker Shea McClellin.\nTight end Travis Kelce has 21 catches for 293 yards and two TDs in the first four games. He also leads NFL tight ends in yards after the catch. He’s Rob Gronkowski with fewer viral videos.\nMcClellin, the wrong linebacker chosen by the wrong general manager, hasn’t made a play in the passing game this season. And now he gets this guy.\nMcClellin, who’s playing inside linebacker because there’s no one else to coach, seems perpetually in the trail technique. And now he gets this guy.\nThe Chiefs offense will throw the ball between the hash marks. It will create picks and decisions because Andy Reid loves high-low routes, especially crossing patterns. It will teach us about McClellin’s progress, athleticism and instincts.\nOr maybe it will confirm what we already believe.\n Chicago Bears Kansas City Chiefs Shea McClellin Oakland Raiders Rob Gronkowski NFL Seattle Seahawks", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617baa9/turbine/ct-bears-cchiefs-shea-mcclellin-rosenbloom-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:51:06.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
