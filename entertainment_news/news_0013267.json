Could Charlie Simpson be set to return to Busted - a decade after quitting forever? Share \nCharlie Simpson is apparently set to return to Busted after he quit for good 10 years ago. \nAccording to The Sun, he is in discussions to re-form the band with James Bourne and Matt Willis – and the trio could be set for an arena tour. Charlie Simpson (Ian West/PA) \nA decade ago, Charlie sensationally quit to focus his efforts on his other band, Fightstar. \nIt spelled the end of Busted – although James and Matt later teamed up with McFly to create the hybrid group McBusted, touring together and releasing an album in 2014. McBusted (Jon Furniss/Invision) \nCharlie has always made it crystal clear he was not interested in a reunion. \nIn 2010, he put out a statement saying: “I want to make it unequivocally clear that I have no interest whatsoever in rejoining Busted and I never will.” \nMcFly frontman Tom Fletcher added fuel to the latest reunion reports, putting out an Instagram shot teasing: “Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Charlie freakin Simpson!…or so rumour has it.” \nSpeaking to MailOnline last year, Charlie admitted: “I went for a long time keeping completely out of touch with Matt and James, but now that they are doing music again, we’ve got in touch and it’s really nice. \n“We used to be really close when we were younger, it’s nice to have that relationship back again.” James Bourne, Charlie Simpson and Matt Willis of Busted in 2004 (Peter Jordan/PA) \nAccording to The Sun, a source close to the band said: “Busted are re-forming by the end of the year and Charlie is part of the band again. It’s amazing because Matt and James have always said there’s more chance of pigs flying than Charlie coming back to Busted. \n“But this is something that has been secretly discussed for a number of months – it was important the three guys felt they could work together again and get along as friends.” Share article \nBusted launched in 2002 and won two Brit awards before splitting in 2005. Their hits include What I Go To School For, Crashed The Wedding, and Year 3000.
