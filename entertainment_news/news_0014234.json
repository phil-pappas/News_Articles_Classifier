Chris Moyles is back and he's declared himself a feminist \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nChris Moyles, the self-proclaimed “saviour of Radio 1″, has become a surprising poster boy for women’s rights. \nChris, now hosting a new breakfast show on Radio X, came to the realisation he was a feminist in an interview with free music magazine NME . Chris Moyles has outed himself as a feminist (John Marshall JM Enternational/Invision/PA) \n“S***, maybe I’m a feminist,” he said. “My manager is female, my assistant is female, my press person is female and my exec producer is female.” \nAnd he put his new found feminism to good use by calling for an end to the “tampon tax”. \n“Why do women have to pay for sanitary products? That’s crazy. That would never happen if it was the other way around!” he said. \nHe has returned to radio following a three-year absence. He was sacked from the BBC in 2012 in favour of a younger replacement, Nick Grimshaw.

People thought I’d given it all up for good, which I hadn’t. \n“They approached me. Be under no illusion that I went knocking on doors for work,” he added.

Apart from Capital and Heart,” he added. Chris also admitted he’s a Swiftie (Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) \nChris’s new home is known for a rockier sound than the pop and indie music played on Radio 1 but he dismissed the branding of the station as male-focused. \n“It’s b**", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:42:37.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
