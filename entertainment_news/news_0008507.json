The 37-year-old Henrietta man who relies on a wheelchair had arrived 2 1/2 hours before his flight to make sure the airline's agents understood how to get him on the 18-seat plane.\nBut after more than an hour of conversation with Air Canada supervisors, Lorch was not able to board the flight, according to his attorney, Kevin Clark of Wesley Clark & Bates.\n“Eventually, Jerremy had to leave without getting on the plane, without going to the conference, without having the opportunity to read his paper in person and do the next steps he needs to take in his study toward his career,” Clark said at a news conference Friday afternoon. “Which leads us to where we are (Friday).\nClark has not yet filed a lawsuit. He said the Americans with Disabilities Act does not apply, and the Air Carrier Access Act does not provide for what he called an appropriate remedy. He said he wanted to investigate the options. With the potential of litigation, Clark preferred that Lorch not speak about what happened. Clark and Lorch’s wife, Ashley, responded to questions.\nLorch is working on his graduate degree in English literature and wants to pursue a doctorate. Lorch also is a founder of the wheelchair rugby team, WNY Wreckers.\nAshley Lorch said she and Jerremy have flown numerous times since he become a quadriplegic after a diving accident several years ago. As she was getting out of work Wednesday, she said her husband called to pick him up from the airport.\n“He said, ‘They wouldn’t let me on the plane,’” she said. “I went through a mix of emotions. At first, my heart just broke for him. He was working very hard on the paper he was to present. It was a very important event for him to go to. Then it got turned to anger. I was so upset at the absolute injustice and discrimination he endured at the airport for no reason.”\nLorch was to have flown to Toronto on a Beechcraft 1900D aircraft to make the connection to Vancouver.\nBuy Photo Jerremy Lorch's boarding pass for the Air Canada flight he was denied access to.

She showed her husband’s boarding pass for the flight from Toronto to Vancouver, which had a wheelchair logo in the lower right corner.\n“Even if they hadn’t prepared adequately, which they should have, once he arrived, they could have done some simple problem-solving,” she said.\nClark said the equipment to get Lorch onto the plane, which was not parked at a jetway, was available but not used. He said Air Canada also denied requests to book Lorch on other airlines or get him to Buffalo.\nA spokesman for Air Canada responded to a request for comment with this emailed statement: \"We recognize and are sorry about the inconvenience caused and we have been in contact with the customer about this matter to apologize and address the situation, and we are refunding his ticket and associated expenses. Moreover, we are reviewing the matter with our ground handler in Rochester to prevent this recurring. As we are still investigating why this occurred, I am sorry but I have no further details to provide.\"\nBuy Photo Jerremy Lorch of Henrietta, with his wife, Ashley Lorch, and attorney Kevin Clark, leave a news conference Friday to discuss how Jerremy Lorch was denied access to an Air Canada flight this week. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nClark responded: \"An apology after what happened because the chance there was media contacting them isn't relevant to anything. There was hours of conversations with Air Canada and with Air Canada supervisors at the airport. If there was going to be an apology that meant anything, it would have occurred then, and they would have done what they were contracted to do and that was put him on the airplane.\n\"Instead, they turned him away and told him if he wanted to maybe apply for a refund, he could do that in some other manner than at the airport. I’m not really sure it was an apology or if it was more just a way to adequately answer questions from the media.\"\nClark said that Lorch presented his paper using Skype, computer software that lets users make video and audio calls. But he said the technology wasn't perfect, as one of the questions referred to a point addressed in the paper. “That indicates it wasn’t completely audible and received in the manner it is in person.”\nClark said that Lorch missed the opportunity to meet professors who may have been able to help him with his applications for his Ph.D. studies. Clark said some people at the conference knew why Lorch was unable to attend, but he couldn’t say what effect Lorch’s inability to network with other presenters would have on his career.\nPSINGER@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fdd627ebc8544ee42d5b69e375024d827f82f90c/r=500x331/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806209746393700-SD-101615-LORCH-B-METRO.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/261a377b80694bfaa68ffdb9c8840a10cae17a29/c=408-0-4285-2915&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806209746393700-SD-101615-LORCH-B-METRO.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806209746393700-SD-101615-LORCH-B-METRO.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f09d5bc004be71b4c880251f22d684a30eea9f9/c=0-39-3956-3013&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806209757157838-SD-101615-LORCH-D-METRO.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806209757157838-SD-101615-LORCH-D-METRO.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e52eb0950510449e12e14dcd36783b503ec39802/r=500x385/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806209757157838-SD-101615-LORCH-D-METRO.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:50:15.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
