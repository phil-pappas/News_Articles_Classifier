The research is the largest long-term study carried out on the association between height and cancer in both genders. Researchers from the Karolinska Institute and University of Stockholm examined 5.5 million men and women in Sweden, born between 1938 and 1991 and with adult heights ranging between 100 cm and 225 cm.

Additionally, taller women had a 20 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer, while the risk of developing melanoma increased by approximately 30 per cent per 10 cm of height in both men and women. \nPrevious studies have also shown the same association between height and cancer. That is to say, taller individuals have a higher risk of developing different types of cancer, including breast cancer and melanoma. However, this association has never been studied in men and women on such a large scale before. ”To our knowledge, this is the largest study performed on linkage between height and cancer including both women and men,” said Emelie Benyi, a PhD student at Karolinska Institutet who led the study. \nThe data on adult heights was collected from the Swedish Medical Birth, the Swedish Conscription, and the Swedish Passport Registers, whereas the cancer data was retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Register. ”It should be emphasised that our results reflect cancer incidence on a population level,” said Benyi. ”As the cause of cancer is multifactorial, it is difficult to predict what impact our results have on cancer risk at the individual level,” said Benyi. The group is now planning on investigating how mortality from cancer and other causes of death are associated with height within the Swedish population. \n“Our studies show that taller individuals are more likely to develop cancer but it is unclear so far if they also have a higher risk of dying from cancer or have an increased mortality overall,” said Benyi. The study was presented at the 54th Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Meeting in Spain. \n(Image Credit- youtube) \n 44 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:33:32.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
