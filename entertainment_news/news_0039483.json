Gomez shot it down on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live on Monday.\n\"I think I would have found that out. Is that a rumor?\" she said. The tabloid rumor mill is just dumb, Gomez added. \"Honestly, it's so stupid. I'm pregnant every week, (Taylor's) gonna be pregnant. It's so stupid, like you can't really read that stuff.\"\nSome fans had other ideas about rumor patrol.\n@taylorswift13 @CalvinHarris POST A SELFIE POST A SELFIE POST A SELFIE POST A SELFIE POST A SELFIE POST A SELFIE get married POST A SELFIE\nâ€” paula (@swiftxforever) October 12, 2015 Harris wasn't taking it as lightly, implying on Twitter that he is suing mad about rumors he paid for a sexual service.\n\"It's not going to be a 'happy ending' for everyone I sue for defamation of character for all these bull--- stories bye bye,\" he tweeted Monday.\nSwift hasn't tweeted anything about the alleged break-up. Perhaps she'll just let her new Vogue Australia cover do the talking?\nðŸ’•New Romantic ðŸ’• @vogueaustralia\nA photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 11, 2015 at 4:22pm PDT\n10 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RD7eDx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802650851035918-GTY-473847600-73131536.JPG", "https://twitter.com/CalvinHarris", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RD7eDx&text=Swift%27s%20boyfriend%20to%20sue%20over%20breakup%20rumors%3F&via=usatoday", "https://instagram.com/p/8tzFy9DvCQ/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eee2f8b606d36ca145bddd6a11430c4e01a5729f/r=322x400/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802650851035918-GTY-473847600-73131536.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RD7eDx&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/CalvinHarris/status/653667241251069952", "https://twitter.com/taylorswift13", "https://twitter.com/swiftxforever/status/653669737709371393", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04d3c6b4e3b240fdfaead752a0df950e53e4ddb3/c=35-0-2285-3000&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802650851035918-GTY-473847600-73131536.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1RD7eDx"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:00:56.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
