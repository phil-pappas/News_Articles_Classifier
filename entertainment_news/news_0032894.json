(AP) - A Pennsylvania candidate for district attorney is citing unproven sex-abuse allegations against comedian Bill Cosby in a TV ad attacking his opponent.\nDemocrat Kevin Steele is running to be Montgomery County's top prosecutor. His new ad attacks Republican candidate Bruce Castor, the county's former prosecutor, for not charging Cosby when the allegations first surfaced in 2005.\nCastor calls the ad \"predictable craziness from a desperate candidate.\"\nCastor has said there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute Cosby when a former Temple University employee accused Cosby of drugging and molesting her.\nThe current district attorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, has refused to confirm whether her office is reinvestigating the complaint by the alleged victim.\nCosby has denied wrongdoing, and settled out of court after the alleged victim sued him.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
