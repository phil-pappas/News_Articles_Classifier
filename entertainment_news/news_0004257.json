It makes me a bit cross sometimes.” \n“So when I go out, I am particularly recognisable, I think. The only person I hang out with who is more recognisable is Matt Lucas, who is recognisable from 100 yards away. And he gets it constantly… people taking photos or double-taking.” Mackenzie Crook says people recognise him as Gareth from The Office (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \nWhile he does get recognised thanks to his Office character, he said: “Gareth was an odd-looking bloke, with the hair… so therefore people will always think of me as a pale, unhealthy, pasty-looking weirdo. \n“And people also hear a West Country accent when I’m talking, when there isn’t one. I am from Kent. My accent is Kentish.” Share article \nThe latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales, is due out in 2017.
