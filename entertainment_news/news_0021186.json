Connection issues also have been reported north of the park.\nAdditionally, Highland Park Fire Department officials have said paramedics in ambulances often struggle to send emergency medical data to Highland Park Hospital until they are closer to the facility because of the amount of cellphone activity generated at Ravinia on busy nights.\nOfficials investigated and found Ravinia patrons sometimes overwhelm the cell towers near the park during sold-out performances. Ravinia Communications Director Nick Pullia said.\n\"A lot of them are texting, trying to find each other,\" he said. \"And there are a lot of selfies, people trying to share the experience.\"\nNearby ravines may also interfere with smartphone service, Pullia said.\nTo solve the problem, the city and Ravinia have proposed erecting a system of antennas that would point inward to the Ravinia property and automatically intercept cellphone calls from concert patrons and route them to a local server.\nThe system also would capture any attempts to use wireless Internet or other data services inside the park and send them to the new server.\nThat would ease the demand for service from the cellphone towers outside the park, officials said.\n\"Ravinia is a tremendous asset to our community and works well with the city,\" Rotering said. \"Together we've come up with a plan to help emergency communications, reconnect residents who are unable to get a cell signal and ease data congestion around Ravinia.\"\nRavinia patrons won't notice a difference in service when they make cellphone calls or post photos and messages to Facebook, Instagram or other social media platforms, Pullia said.\n\"We think this is going to be a wonderful way to solve the problem,\" he said.\nThe proposal will require construction of a building in Ravinia's west parking lot, Rotering said, and the installation of small antennas that will be hidden around the festival grounds.\n\"It's an unobtrusive system that will have no negative impact on the neighbors,\" Pullia said.\nThe system would run year round, not just during Ravinia's concert season.\nA cost estimate was not immediately available. Ravinia will pay the upfront construction and installation costs, Pullia said.\nThe venue would collect rent from telecommunications companies using the equipment. That money would help fund educational programs at Ravinia, Pullia said.\nThe city's plan and design commission will discuss the proposal at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at city hall, 1707 St. Johns Ave.\nIf the city eventually approves the plan, the new antenna system could be in place in May 2016, before the next Ravinia Festival season starts, Pullia said.\n News Venues Highland Park Entertainment", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:37:26.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
