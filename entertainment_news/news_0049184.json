Singer-Songwriter J. Scott Baston reflected \"I write each song from a Non-Fiction point of view, and the subject are focused around real situations, events, emotions, etc. I think that as people come to hear the featured songs; my hopes is that the raw emotion of each tune will evoke feelings of a deep spiritual nature from which they come, and apply that too their own reality.\"\nThe Saint Francis Band was born from a wealth of experience and knowledge, denouncing negative ego, and replacing it with humanitarianism, and love through the power of music. Their collaboration is one of creative force, radiating from the purest of hearts with the most genuine of souls. The content of their songs relate to everyone through the power of music.\nRecordings include the album \"One of Many\"; the single, \"Revolution Radio\"; and currently in production an album at Omni Sound in Nashville with Tommy Cooper producing and engineering, and John Keane Studios in Athens.\nA special streaming concert of three of their songs is also featured at the Franciscanized World News Page: \"Cassidy's Sky\", \"Teacher\" and \"Jericho\"\nEstablished in 1869, the Roman Catholic Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity serve in Catholic Health Care, Education and Parish-Community Service in the Southwest, Central and Upper Midwest. Their Franciscanized World News Page offers updates on the sister's latest ministries and vocations, and celebrates seeing the world as St. Francis and St. Clare did: the good and holy possibility in the culture of everyday life.\nThe Future Is Ours - The Calling Is Yours.
