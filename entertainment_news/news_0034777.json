The eerie stage opus was a project of students from De La Salle-College of St. Benilde and written by the late Mario O’ Hara. \nConsidering how busy Ricky is with his TV and film projects, I salute him for finding time to work with kids. The seasoned actor in him is giving back to the industry by being a mentor to these budding artists. Despite his stature, Ricky makes sure that he is still within reach of those who look up to him. Here’s my one-on-one with Ricky. ADVERTISEMENT \nWhat’s more fulfilling, doing theater or movies? \nBoth mediums are fulfilling, but theater really is an actor’s medium. Doing theater requires a lot of time and discipline. It is not as financially rewarding as TV and film, but the experience, benefits and lessons from theater are priceless. It’s food for the soul. \nWhat was it like working with students? \nIt made me remember my youth and it prompted me to assess my life as an actor. Their energy, enthusiasm and exuberance got to me. I learned new things from them. They have very fresh ideas. \nHow has the play changed you? \nI’m happy I did it. It’s not all about money. It’s my way of sharing the blessings I’ve received throughout my career. By doing that, I got more in return. Acting is really a continuous learning process. \nHunky softie GARDO Versoza, in drag, practiced being sweet and soft for gay role. \nGardo Versoza and Dominic Ochoa’s performances as gay lovers in the Regal rom-com, Jun Robles Lana’s “The Prenup,” totally cracked me up. I have not had the chance to hang out with Gardo, but we clicked instantly while chatting online. It felt like we were old friends. He is in search of his “Machete” statue so he can display it at the birthday bash of his 2-year-old son, Uziel. \nWhat a bizarre yet cool idea for a kiddie party. Gardo fondly calls his followers online, Cupcakes. Beneath his lean and mean bod, he is quite a softie. \nHere’s my tête-à-tête with Gardo: \nWhat do you think of prenup arrangements? \nI think love and respect are the prerequisites of marriage … not money matters. \nHow did you prepare for the gay role? \nI love doing roles that are far from my true self. I just practiced being gentle, sweet and soft. \nWhat was harder to portray, Machete or a gay parent? \nBoth are tough to do but since I enjoy my job as an actor, being on the set is just like having a big playground. \nHow do you feel about being immortalized in gay lingo with the term “HagGardo Versoza”? \nIt’s very flattering. I never thought my name would be part of “gayspeak.” \nWhat would you like to change in the industry? \nTaxes, working hours, quality of shows. I hope there will be a guild that will support all artists. \nIf your life story would be made into a movie, what will the title be? \n“Machete is Proud and Gay.” (Laughs.) \nManaging wealth \nIn show biz, there is definitely a need for wealth management, education and investment guidance. But most celebs find these concepts intimidating. So it was a pleasant surprise when my “Santa” friend, Allan \nGerman, and his associate, Royce Balderian, invited me to the product launch of the Philam Asset Management Inc.’s (Pami) Equity Index Fund. \nIt’s good to know that one of the country’s largest asset and wealth managers can help make investing enjoyable and educational at the same time. Congrats, Pami. \nStress-busters \nLiberate yourself from the stressors of work and urban traffic.
