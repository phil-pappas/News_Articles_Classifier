Sweetest Devotion \nThis is her first album since 2011′s 21 – named after the age she was when she wrote it. Adele, now 27, seems to have followed this precedent – naming her new album 25. In a post on her website she explained: \n“I feel like I’ve spent my whole life so far wishing it away. Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else, wishing I could remember and wishing I could forget too … \n“My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I’m making up with myself. Making up for lost time … Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I’m going to be forever.” \nShe added: “25 is about getting to know who I’ve become without realising. And I’m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.” Share article \nAdele’s new album 25 is out November 20.
