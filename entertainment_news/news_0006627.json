It was 21th Palestinian stabbing attack in 11 days.\nThe suspect, sitting outside the Damascus Gate into the walled Old City, raised the suspicion of police because he was wearing military camouflage pants and seemed nervous, police said.\nAsked to show his identity card, he produced a knife and started storming toward policemen trying to stab them, before eventually being shot dead, spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld said. A local bystander and a tourist were injured in the attempts to shoot the assailant, police said.\nHundreds of troops were being deployed on Wednesday in Israeli cities following a series of shooting and stabbing attacks by Palestinians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:34:07.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
