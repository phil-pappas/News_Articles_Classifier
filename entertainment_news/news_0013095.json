That's just the way the late founder Jimmy McGettrick would have wanted it, and the fact that it was a benefit for the Gavin Foundation, fighting opiate abuse, would have made him even prouder. That prolonged version of \"The Wild Rover\" was supposed to be the band's last song, but they ended up performing for another 45 minutes or so, providing more indelible memories to take away. After the show, Casey noted that the whole thing had been put together in a matter of days, and they were gratified by the response--practically an instant sellout of the 250 tickets. \"We're just glad we were back home, and off touring, at the right time and able to make this happen,\" said Casey. \"We probably got it together in two days, but that's all we need, and we're really grateful we were able to do it to say goodbye to the club.\" The night's performance had started with a moment of silence to remember Jimmy McGettrick, who had founded the club in 1959, and ran it until his death four years ago. At the end of that silence, a tape played over the sound system, with Jimmy's voice welcoming patrons to The Beachcomber, and then giving the exhortation he delivered on so many Saturday nights, \"One more time!\" But this time the phrase was repeated and faded into the opening notes of the Dropkick Murphys first song. It was that kind of night, fond memories and celebration, and also reunions with former staff and regulars. We met an old friend we hadn't seen since the old Catch A Rising Star comedy club closed in Harvard Square in the early 1990s--now living in Lowell, he'd come down and snagged the second spot in line at 7 a.m. for the tickets the Beachcomber sold Saturday at noon. Our pal noted he'd been chatting in that line with the third man in line, and they'd become friends. The third man in line turned out to be a retired local fireman who'd frequented the club. Both men agreed it had been a miserable, cold and rainy morning to be waiting in line, but well worth the trouble to rock out at The Beachcomber one more night. Later on we were chatting with a Quincy policeman, who was there off-duty with some friends, several of them also cops, and all there because they'd worked details at The Beachcomber, and had warm memories of those nights and Jimmy McGettrick. \"I think it was about respect,\" the policeman said, \"Jimmy respected his customers, and respected the job we did, and made it a pleasure to work here..and the groups we heard back then, in the early 2000s, were really tops.\" A former waitress stopped us to say hello, noting that she'd married, spent some years in South Africa where her husband had property, and now has four kids. Now living back in the area, she couldn't miss this last look at the old joint. And just like The Beachcomber, it didn't appear to us that she'd changed at all in the intervening decades. Another friend chuckled as we agreed The Beachcomber had been a unique place, even among rock venues. \"One thing's for sure,\" he said, \"we'll never see a men's room like that again.\" But the focal point was surely the music, and The Dropkick Murphys were always one of Pat McGettrick's favorite bands, and one of his booking fantasies, once he took over that role from his dad a decade or so back. The Dropkicks had played the club once before, for a benefit, but last night's blast was obviously a little more special. The Dropkick Murphys' patented blend of traditional Celtic elements with punk rock fervor was displayed in all its gritty glory on \"Boys on the Docks,\" with many fans pogoing in place, and many fists gleefully raised skyward. A special guest singer, \"Seamus from Donegal,\" was brought onstage to sing AC/DC's \"Highway to Hell\" and he had clearly studied the Aussie rockers, and the Bon Scott/Brian Johnson vocal style, yowling through it with abandon, even if he sounded a few notes above the original. Casey noted at the song's end he might've hurt himself just listening to one of those notes. Mandolin gave \"The Rose Tattoo\" an even more traditional flavor, although the band amped it up as they went along, until the club resembled a mass two-step. A tune devoted to Massachusetts was agreeably raucous, and of course the obligatory cover \"Dirty Water\" got the whole throng of fans grooving and grinding. Trying again to conclude the set, the Dropkick Murphys did a standout version of \"Kiss Me, I'm (Blitzed),\" but did it at a slower pace, where the truly funny lyrics could be fully understood, as the tipsy braggart mentions, among other things, he has degrees from Harvard and Yale. The crowd would not let them get away, so the group uncorked a blazing take on \"Charley on the MTA,\" done at a rapid pace and with numerous amateur singers joining the musicians on stage. Somehow that morphed into \"Skinheads on the MTA,\" and dissolved into a slap-happy chorus of \"away-away-away-o,\" as if the 40 folks on the stage were trying to sing away the approaching curfew. Casey restored order on stage, although many of the fans stayed there, while the band sent the Beachcomber out with a wistful take on \"Going Out in Style.\" As the lights came up, the sound system played Frank Sinatra's \"My Way.\" People lingered for an hour or more, chatting, renewing friendships, taking photos, and gazing at the array of old pictures on the walls. Several classic photos seemed to have been removed, or looted over the past few weeks, with the occasional empty spaces on the walls standing as mute testimony to the crude way some fans express their nostalgia. Plans to auction off some of the memorabilia are on hold, as the new owners reportedly want to save and display it on their walls, so those photos of Bobby Darin, or Rocky Marciano, for example, may yet have another life. But most people were content to leave with another night of warm memories of the old music venue, after the kind of steamy night of fun that used to be a weekly occurrence. The only thing missing from The Beachcomber's finale was the man who made it great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:56:56.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
