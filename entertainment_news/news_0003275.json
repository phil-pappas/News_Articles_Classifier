The film is directed by Vignesh Menon, who earlier made Vinmeengal and has music by C Sathya of Engaeyum Eppothum fame.\nThe music director tells us that the film is a dark thriller about a drug addict who gets out out of his addiction and the problems that he faces. \"The pattern of the storytelling will be very different for audiences and that gave me an opportunity to experiment with the music, especially the background score. It will be stylish and driven by guitar, dubstep and a whole variety of genres,\" says Sathya.\nHe says that Vignesh had even asked him to compose a virutham from Kamba Ramayanam for the soundtrack. However, the piece, which is included the film's music album, will not be part of the film. \"During the editing stage, we found that we couldn't place it at the situation we wanted as that impacted the flow of the story. We decided to cut it out of the film. Instead, Vignesh is now using it for the making-of video of the film,\" he reveals.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:58:20.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
