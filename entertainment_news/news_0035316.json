The inclusion of robots from the Lego Movie in the level is also a nice touch.\nGameplay aside, the strength of this new game offering is the way it seamlessly integrates the joy of physically building Lego with its on-screen, digital world. Each vehicle and set can be rebuilt to reflect changes and progress in the game, giving players the chance to flex their imaginations as well as their problem solving skills to complete levels.\nLego have already released a variety of add-on level, including Jurassic World, Back to the Future and the Simpsons, with more, such as Doctor Who and Angry Birds already in the works.\nThe add-ons, which are available as fun, level and battle packs, give players access to additional gameplay, adding extra layers and depth to the game’s already impressive universe.\nHowever, at £15 to £30, they don’t come cheap and that is a downside. The price tag is likely to cause a headache for parents and could put some players off investing further in the game, which would be a real shame.\nShare article Despite the cost, Lego Dimensions really is a dream come true for any Lego fan. It should not be missed.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-wi9vaTbRo", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SDaDRcDmFk", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:06:20.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
