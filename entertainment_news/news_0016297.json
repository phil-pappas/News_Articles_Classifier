The grey high collared gown with long pouf sleeves and frill texturing or the mid waisted one shoulder flowing gown with ruffles and pearls or high collar midi dress with frill and pearl texturing transported the audience to the 1950s era despite being at the NSIC Ground, Okhla here on Saturday. \n“It was a fun show. The collection is very romantic. We worked with a lot of sheer and we have never done a complete collection on organza,” Gauri told reporters after the show. The sisters, popular for designing glamorous evening wear, also made use of pearls in abundance this time. \n“Gauri is into a lot of pearls. We have been thinking of using them in our collection for a while, but never got a chance to do so. This time with organza and everything delicate and feminine, we found the opportunity to use pearls,” said Nainika. While the collection was mostly dominated by soft colours like peach, coral pink and blue, there were a few pieces in fiery red too. \nModified Date: October 11, 2015 3:24 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:10:16.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
