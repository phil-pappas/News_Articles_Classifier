(AP Photo/Francois Mori) By THOMAS ADAMSON The Associated Press PARIS — \nThe sky was the limit in Karl Lagerfeld's aviation-themed Chanel show on Tuesday, which saw an entire airport re-created under the lofty expanse of Paris' Grand Palais. \nGuests couldn't quite believe their eyes as they entered one of Lagerfeld's most ambitious shows yet. \nYoung Japanese fashionistas bumped in to each other to take selfies beneath a giant electronic passenger information table, as model Cara Delevingne, singer Vanessa Paradis and tennis star Maria Sharapova breezed by. \nHostesses sat at check-in desks plastered in \"Chanel Airlines\" — with departure lounge chairs sprawling for hundreds of meters (yards). \nDestinations on the board — Shanghai, Dallas, Salzburg, Dubai, Tokyo — were a showy check list of all the cities in which Chanel has recently presented collections, highlighting the global nature of one of the world's most lucrative luxury brands. \nBut the show itself, bien sur, was in Terminal No. 5, a reference to the brand's famous perfume. \n\"The inspiration is travel , long distance travel to every destination,\" Lagerfeld said, sipping a glass of mineral water from a silver platter. \nThe 95 diverse ready-to-wear looks riffed off the voyaging theme — with blue, red and white sweaters slung around shoulders, dresses printed with electronic passenger data, comfy check sandals, and bejeweled Chanel suitcases that will literally fly off the shelves. \nThere were even comfy '70s flared jeans, which Lagerfeld later acknowledged were made from exorbitantly-priced soft crepe. \n\"I like the idea of beautifully made clothes, used and worn like street wear,\" he explained. \nSome of the looks in the swirling check patterns suffered from their pure exuberance. But the collection had a little bit for every woman from every country in the world. \n___ \nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:54:57.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
