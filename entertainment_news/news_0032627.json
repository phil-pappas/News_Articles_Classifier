At the center of the campaign is the notion of \" AWWWESOME ,\" which is used to punctuate the company's value offerings, competitive advantages and emotional connection with its customers. Key holiday messages are conveyed through a series of clever advertisements that reveal what goes on in toyland after store closing, while a number of poignant spots capture the spirit of the season and intimacy of special moments with loved ones.\nCheck out the \"AWWWESOME\" commercials and some behind-the-scenes photos: https://toysrus.sharefile.com/d-s70e6c6e32604025b .\n\"AWWWESOME is central to this year's campaign because it speaks not only to our breadth of selection and expertise, but it is exactly what kids see when they walk wide-eyed into a Toys\"R\"Us store,\" said Rich Lennox , Senior Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer, Toys\"R\"Us, U.S. \"As consumers begin to make decisions on where to shop this holiday season, we wanted to clearly convey the unique value proposition we are offering through strong promotional messages – but ones that are delivered in a fun and engaging way. And, as a brand that is truly synonymous with the holidays, we wanted to take pause and reflect on those special moments that are at the heart of what Christmas is all about.\"\nWitty \"Shelf-Talker\" Spots Put Toys On Center Stage\nTo illustrate the company's breadth of products and unique services, Toys\"R\"Us is imagining what happens in toyland when no one is looking through a series of more than a dozen \"Shelf Talker\" spots. The 15- and 30-second ads, which will begin to air this week, reveal a whole new world where hijinks and drama ensue among the varied personalities of toys found in the store. One demonstrates the company's vast selection of toys as everyone's favorite power couple, Ken ® and Barbie ® , lost, drive through the store aisles in their pink convertible. Ken is in the driver's seat – and, in that all-too-true scenario – he is convinced they are headed in the right direction and refuses to ask for help in finding their destination. In a second spot, which reinforces the company's Price Match Guarantee, Optimus Prime learns a tough lesson as a baby doll inadvertently lets it slip that he is but one of many tough Transformers ® on the shelf, sending him into hysterics. New \"Shelf Talker\" spots will be introduced throughout the holiday season featuring popular toys while delivering customer benefits, such as current deals and services available at Toys\"R\"Us.\nCapturing the True Spirit and Heart of the Season\nIn a series of beautifully filmed 30- and 60-second spots, Toys\"R\"Us seeks to place a spotlight on those moments of giving, surprise and wonder that make Christmas so special. The first ad, which will begin airing on November 1, unfolds as a young child notices her elderly neighbor has the only house on the block left undecorated for the holiday season. The girl decides to make this gentleman's holiday merrier by enlisting the help of a friend to trim a large tree in his front yard. Her efforts appear to go unappreciated, and she is crestfallen. On Christmas morning, however, the little girl awakens to find a note at her front door and is amazed to discover that her neighbor has left mountains of gifts under the tree. As she and her friends run to unwrap the presents, the little girl notices the gentleman peering out his window, and they smile at each other knowing each has been given the best possible gift of the season.\nAdditional ads, which demonstrate the spirit of Christmas, will be unveiled throughout the holiday season. They will air on TV and be featured in cinemas across the country.\nCreated in partnership with BBDO Worldwide, an international, award-winning creative agency, the spots will air on all major networks and cable stations, including ABC, CBS, CW, FOX and NBC, as well as ABC Family, Animal Planet, A&E, BET, Bravo, Discovery Family, E!, Food Network, Hallmark, HGTV, Lifetime, OWN, Oxygen, TBS, TLC and TNT, among others. Top national morning and syndicated talk shows, including TODAY, Live with Kelly & Michael , ELLEN, Rachael Ray , The Dr. Oz Show, The Fab Life and Steve Harvey , will air the commercials throughout the holidays.\nExtending the Campaign with Unique Digital Content\nTo extend the reach of the \"AWWWESOME\" campaign, Toys\"R\"Us will feature brand new, exclusive content on the company's social media channels including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. Continuing all season long, Toys\"R\"Us will have an exciting playlist on YouTube, combining the wit of \"Shelf Talkers\" with the concept of the immensely popular unboxing videos. Fans can watch as their favorite playthings release each other from their packaging, while showcasing the unique features and personalities of these toys. Kids and kids at heart can also check out YouTube.com/ToysRUs for fun, time-lapse videos and behind-the-scenes content of the campaign, as well as to replay the magical moments of the commercials.\nAdditionally, now through mid-December, Toys\"R\"Us promotional activity will be seen across the Web. The strategy includes premier placements on high-impact homepages, including YouTube and Hulu.com, among others. And, as a digital extension of the retailer's broadcast promotions, ABC.com, CBS.com, FOX.com and NBC.com will feature Toys\"R\"Us ads online as part of a larger partnership with the networks.\nFor company news and updates throughout the season, please visit \"R\" Holiday Press Room .\nAbout Toys\"R\"Us, Inc.\nToys\"R\"Us, Inc. is the world's leading dedicated toy and baby products retailer, offering a differentiated shopping experience through its family of brands.
