A show Saturday in Reading, Pennsylvania has been canceled, but as of this writing, Nelson's performance at the American Roots Music & Arts Festival in Raleigh Sunday is still a-go. \nThe Florence Civic Center says fans can get refunds at their point of purchase if they're unable to attend the rescheduled show, which is currently slated for April 6, however the latest statement from the venue says that date may change again: We have a new update on the Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard postponement. It appears there may now be a hiccup with the April 6, 2016 date; however we are certainly rescheduling the show. Due to the logistical issues of coordinating several cities and rescheduling multiple dates, the tour is still finalizing these details. The tour hopes to announce the official Florence date early next week. Do not fret fans, we are working hard to finalize this and will keep you updated.
