Or in other words, alien megastructures.\nThe cluster, star KIC 8462852, is situated just above the Milkyway(they're planning an invasion, obviously), and lies between the Cygnus and Lyra constellations.\nSpeaking the The Atlantic , Wright said \"I was fascinated by how crazy it looked\".\n\"Aliens should always be the very last hypothesis you consider, but this looked like something you would expect an alien civilisation to build\".\nAstronomers first paid attention to the star back in 2009, when the Kepler Space Telescope, which was searching to find other hospitable planets, noticed KIC 8462852 was emitting a stranger light than the other 150,000 stars on its radar.\nAfter four further years of studying the star, astronomers still weren't sure as to why the star is surrounded by a mass of debris, but believe it has something to do with it drawing energy sources into its path, as it harnesses their power.\nDoes that mean aliens? Maybe. Or else it means it's just a fluke, or a coincidence. Either way, the three astronomers working on the report think it could be sign of life in space, and want to point a radio dish at it for further study, to see if they can find any signs of technological life.\nIf they get the go-ahead, they could have the first report back by January, so we're basically four months away from proving alien life. Or y'know, going back to saying there are without any proof.\nVia Independent.co.uk\nMORE: NASA reveal Dawn spacecraft images of the dwarf planet Ceres\nMORE: Watch: NASA's 4k video of coloured water floating in space has us mesmerised\nMORE: Pics: Body of a '250 foot alien cyborg' spotted on the Rosetta probe comet", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forget-water-on-mars-astronomers-may-have-just-found-giant-alien-megastructures-orbiting-a-star-near-a6693886.html", "http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:55:06.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
