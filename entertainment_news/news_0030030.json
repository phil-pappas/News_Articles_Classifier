And you know, also, just push-ups, like wide-arm push-ups, are good for arm and back. Simple and easy. \n\"(I work out) whenever I can. When you have kids in school, that's a lot easier... I just make sure that I'm consistent with it and I'm just mindful.\" \nThe 36-year-old is particularly strict on herself during the holiday season, when she tends to indulge in comfort foods. \n\"I just keep working out,\" she reveals. \"You can't stop. Everyone thinks there's a trick (to staying in shape), but there's no trick! The trick is, you have to be consistent. \n\"I'm a mindful eater. I'm a foodie, so for me, I had to try to figure out how to understand what I'm eating, and then I got really into it and I got excited what I was learning about food.\" \nHer fresh approach to food and exercise has also left the star feeling better than she ever did in her 20s. \n\"I feel better all around,\" she claims. \"I feel like I'm more clear, I feel like I've had done some good work internally, and I just feel like I'm in a nice place and enjoying life. We get to a point where we're like, 'You know what? One day we're just not gonna be here anymore, so I'm going to enjoy every second of it.'\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:38:44.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
