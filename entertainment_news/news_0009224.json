MORE 'STRICTLY': \nWeight has dropped off the singer since he started on the BBC ballroom show last month, and admitted he is still shedding pounds despite gorging on unhealthy food. \nPeter Andre on 'This Morning' \nSpeaking to Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on Tuesday's (20 October) ‘ This Morning ’, Peter said: I am exactly the same weight I was 20 years ago in my ‘Mysterious Girl’ video - it’s unbelievable. \n\"When you do the show, you can eat what you want. The only time you feel guilt-free.” \nWhile Peter got off to a flying start on ‘Strictly’, topping the leaderboard in the first week, he has since dropped slightly down the ranks, and he admitted that nerves are getting to him. \n“The nerves you have on the show is something I’ve never experienced before,” he explained. “You don’t want to get anything wrong… but it’s great fun. \n“And you know when they say the woman is always right? In this case she [his professional dance partner Janette Manrara] is!” \nPeter with partner Janette Manrara \nPete added that his wife Emily is also feeling the pressure too, saying: “She’s nervous for me. She knows how passionate I am and how I love doing what I do, but she also knows I’m clumsy! But she’s so proud.” \nPeter and Janette will be performing a Rhumba on Saturday’s (24 October) ‘Strictly’, as they hope of dethroning Katie Derham and Anton Du Beke from the top of the leaderboard, after they were awarded 33 out of 40 for their Viennese Waltz last week . \n‘Strictly Come Dancing’ continues on Saturday at 6.35pm on BBC One.
