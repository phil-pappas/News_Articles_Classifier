Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, and was in a coma for two weeks. \nThe comedian, who has been absent from TV screens since the crash, made his return to the U.S. comedy sketch show on Saturday. \nHe tweeted before the show was about to air, \"You best be turning on your television in about an hour and watch me bring the funny on @nbcsnl! It's good to be home!!!! (sic)\" \nTracy even managed to laugh off the accident, and began his opening monologue by pretending to have a speech impediment, before saying he was \"just joking.\" \nHe told the audience, \"I was in a terrible car accident more than a year ago. It was awful, but it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world. \n\"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?' The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.\" \nTracy was then reunited with his \"30 Rock\" co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer for a sketch in which the comedian's character from the show, Tracy Jordan, nearly died. \nAfter the skit, Tina sincerely welcomed her former co-star back without any need for laughs: \"This is no joke. We're so happy you're OK. We're even happier you're ready to make people laugh again.\" \nLater in the show, Tracy appeared alongside musical guest Demi Lovato, who played an alien opposite Tracy's promiscuous astronaut. \nThe comedian has been gearing up for his \"Saturday Night Live\" comeback and appeared at the Comedy Cellar in New York on 13 October to perform stand-up for the first time since his accident.
