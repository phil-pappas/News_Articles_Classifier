Comment Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 4:47 PM By Stan Sulewski Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 4:47 PM PORTLAND Portland residents will have the opportunity to learn about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle during next weeks ‘Healthy Portland Day.’ The free event is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 10 from 9 a.m. to noon at the Portland City Hall, which is located at 259 Kent St. in Portland. The event is being hosted by Dr. Jason Williamson of Willemin Chiropractic and the Portland Main Street organization. “It’s very important to have events like this in the community that are geared toward promoting a healthier lifestyle,” said Shelley Perry, manager of the Portland Main Street organization. “This is the third year it’s been done and it’s a community service to acquaint people with certain health issues.” The event will allow community members access to a variety of healthcare organizations. Each organization will have booths in order to display their services while providing demonstrations as well as screenings. “As healthcare providers in Portland, we are constantly trying to do anything we can to make the lives of those around us as healthy as possible,” Williamson said in a press release. “We work very hard in our community to give people the tools they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their family’s health and well-being. It is for this reason we are thrilled and proud to be hosting this event for Portland.” There will also be a 5K ‘Rockin’ River Color Run,’ which will start off the days festivities at 9 a.m. Portland Main Street, Portland St. Patrick’s School and Healthy Portland have made the event possible, which provides a fun, non-timed race along the Portland River Trail System. “The Color Run is a great fit for this too, because it kicks off the event to get people out on the trails and gets people moving,” Perry said. “It’s geared toward families, so people can bring the kids, or the dogs. It’s a great way to get people active.” Runners are urged to stay after the completion of the race to see the vendors and displays. There will be speakers at the event to discuss getting kids active and keeping them active, a new breast cancer screening tool, health insurance issues, spiritual healing, and more. Starting at 9:30 a.m., Dr. Russ Willemin will speak about his journey since being diagnosed with kidney cancer; at 10 a.m. a representative from the State of Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services will be providing insight on different insurances; at 10:30 a.m. the group Miller In Motion will be speaking on the importance of keeping children healthy; representatives from the company It Works will have a presentation at 11 a.m. highlighting their products; and at 11:30 a.m. Dr. Jennifer Culp will have a presentation on how to prevent negative health issues.

Toothpic the Clown will be providing balloon animals to children. Proceeds from the event will benefit Relief After Violent Encounter organization of Ionia and Montcalm counties, as well as the Portland St. Patrick School Athletic Association. “The more we know about our health and ways to be healthy, the better decisions we make regarding our health,” Williamson said. “With all of the health care questions out there, people need a place for answers and solutions, not quick temporary fixes. Health improves in our community through education, awareness, and people making lifestyle changes. I work very hard in our community to give people the tools they need to take back responsibility for their family’s health and well-being. It is for this reason that I am so proud to be bringing this event to our town.” For more information about the event or to register for the Color Run, visit the Rockin’ River 5K Color Run Facebook page or visit www.portlandmainstreet.org .
