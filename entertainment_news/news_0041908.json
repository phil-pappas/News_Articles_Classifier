Donald R. Griffin, 37, pleaded guilty to committing a murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise before U.S. District Judge Richard A. Arcara, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The charge carries a penalty of life in prison and a fine of $250,000.\nGriffin will be sentenced at 1 p.m. Feb. 3.\nAccording to Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony M. Bruce, Griffin was one of three individuals who broke into the Medina home of 78-year-old Homer Marciniak early July 5, 2010.\nThey allegedly wanted to steal Marciniak's collection of comic books. The U.S. Attorney's Office estimate their value at $30,000, but previous estimates have been as high as $100,000.\nMarciniak woke up and encountered the three individuals in the hallway. Griffin reportedly struck Marciniak in the face, causing cuts.\nThe three individuals left and Marciniak was taken by ambulance to Medina Memorial Hospital, where his injuries were treated. Marciniak was released from the hospital, but he died a short time later after going into cardiac arrest.\nThe government was prepared to show at trial that the blow Griffin struck and emotional trauma from the burglary led to Marciniak's death.\nRico Vendetti of Irondequoit, the former owner of East Side Gold and Audio Pawn Shop and Al's Green Tavern on North Goodman Street, engineered the burglary. He pleaded guilty in December 2014 of racketeering influenced corrupt organization, or RICO, and is awaiting sentencing.\nTerry Stewart and Brandon Meade were also convicted in connection with this case.\nThe two other individuals charged in the burglary were Juan Javier and Albert Parsons. Javier, who was a juvenile at the time of the burglary, was convicted of robbery in Orleans County Court. Parsons will be tried in federal court, along with co-defendants Arlene Combs and Dayon Shaver, on Dec. 8.\nWCLEVELAND@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nIrondequoit man pleads guilty to racketeering\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRochester man admits selling stolen goods on eBay", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/204a3d200f80357c97c70b3dc58d64164550c9a6/c=86-15-445-374/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/09/20/news-brief.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/173eacca5b183faa719cbd655c897a0267a8c808/c=0-0-414-414/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/10/02/57445037.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:13:39.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
