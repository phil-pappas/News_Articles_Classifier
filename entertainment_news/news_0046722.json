Now that there are so many additives in our food, some of the ingredients lists are very long—mostly chemicals, by the way—and a bar is only so big. Unless you can see an apple seed from five miles away, you need a jeweler’s loupe to read those lists. If you are a wise person and like to find out what’s in your food before you lay down your hard-earned money for it, that can be a problem.\nHere’s a product that eliminates that problem altogether: That’s It fruit bars . They’re aptly named, because every bar has only two ingredients, and both are fruits. There are absolutely no other ingredients at all. Two fruits and that’s it (hence the name). Not only that, both fruits are identified in large print on the front of the bar, along with a picture of each. Even if you forgot your readers, you can tell what’s in them by looking at the pictures. All the bars are made with apple; it’s the second fruit that’s different in each. No matter which flavor you get, you’re getting a whole apple in each one. An apple a day does keep the doctor away, according to recent research, too. The combinations include:\n• Apple + cherry (1 apple + 10 cherries)\n• Apple + blueberry (1 apple + 20 blueberries)\n• Apple + strawberry (1 apple + 12 strawberries)\n• Apple + banana (1 apple + 1 banana)\n• Apple + apricot (1 apple + 3 apricots)\n• Apple + pineapple (1 apple + ¼ pineapple)\n• Apple + pear (1 apple + 1 pear)\n• Apple + coconut (1 apple + ¼ coconut)\nThese fruit bars are similar to other fruit bars you may have tried, like Larabars, except with some important differences. With no nuts in any of these bars, even people with nut allergies or on fat-free diets can eat them. There is no added sugar in any form and no preservatives. They also have no GMOs (hurray!). They are kosher, vegan, raw, and gluten free. Being totally made of fruit, they contain 4 grams of fiber and 1 gram of protein. If you dislike the too-spicy and sometimes cloying flavors of some other fruit bars, you’ll be happy with these, because there is no spice in them at all.\nThen there is the convenience of these bars. Fresh fruit is great, but it’s not in season all year long and not always easy to carry around. Even when you can find fresh fruit, try carrying an apple and 12 strawberries in your handbag or backpack.\nYou could make fruit bars at home if you wanted to. You don’t. At least, not unless you have a dehydrator, a lot of fruit, and a lot of time. You would have to wash all the fruits, process them in your Vitamix or food processor, and lay the mix out in the dehydrator in bar shapes, then wait a lot of hours before they’re done. Then you would have to find some way to preserve their flavor and freshness that’s as good as sealing them in a hermetically sealed commercially made wrapper. Good luck there. Plus you would then have to clean up all the mess (ugh!). Do you want to do all that, or do you just want someone else to do it for you and offer it in a nice sealed packet that you can throw into your handbag, backpack, briefcase, or your child’s lunchbox? If you like fruit bars, just get these and save yourself all the trouble.\nYou might be wondering what these taste like. They actually taste the way you would expect--like dried fruit. The difference is that unlike whole pieces of dried fruit, which can be tough and chewy and possibly dislodge your molars, these are much easier to bite into because the fruit has been ground up before being made into bars. All the flavors are good. Just pick the ones that contain your favorite fruits.\nPerhaps you’re not a fruit purist or a health nut and you’d like something that’s more like a chocolate candy bar. No problem. Just unwrap your That’s It bar, break your favorite chocolate bar in half, and sandwich the fruit bar between the chocolate. Now you get all the benefits of two servings of fruit AND your chocolate too. And that will not only help satisfy your fruit requirement for the day but also your compelling need for chocolate.", "external_links": ["http://shop.thatsitfruit.com/fruit-bars/"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:39:03.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
