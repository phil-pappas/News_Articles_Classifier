Lin Kramer posted an open letter to Party City's Facebook page earlier this month. In it, she urged the store to stop selling \"sexualized\" Halloween costumes for young girls. \nKramer states Party City offers a wide rage of career costumes for boys, including one of a police officer. When it comes to girls, only three career costumes are available: a cheerleader, a cowgirl and, again, a police officer... but this one has a completely different look. \nKramer requested the company at least offer girls more options, saying: \" Even if you insist (and i really hope you don't) on offering the sexualized version of costumes for little girls, you could *also* offer girls the realistic option of the same costume.\" \nParty City responded to Kramer's message, thanking her for feedback, but then deleted her initial post on their Facebook page. Still, it's gaining national attention, with people on both sides of the argument commenting on the issue. \nSo what do you think? Have Halloween costumes for little girls become too sexy? \nPlus: Twitter Goes Beyond 140 Characters Edward Snowden Joins Twitter Millennials and Their Selfie Obsession", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:30:26.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
