The Hard Rock store will sell several pink items, such as its best-selling Classic Collection junior cut T-shirt featuring the Hard Rock logo; a fuchsia and pink color blended animal print Rock Royalty Couture Scarf ($18), and a collectable guitar-shaped Pinktober pin ($12) that features a pink breast cancer awareness ribbon and an inspirational message embellished with rhinestones and also comes with a second smaller pin to share with a friend to help spread support and awareness.\nAt the Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood on Hollywood Blvd, Kaya Stewart will put on a show October 8, 8 p.m., to benefit City of Hope, a leader in the fight against breast cancer. The show is free, but attendees will have the opportunity to make a donation to City of Hope.\nBesides the pink-themed food and drink specials and memorability, Hard Rock will feature its regular menu of smokehouse ribs and chicken, creative pizzas and legendary burgers, housemade from fresh and locally sourced ingredients.\nWhile many think of Hard Rock as a great happy hour stop or date night venue, Hard Rock has a rockin’ 10-and-under menu with killer kid entrees like Razzi’s Redonkulous Chicken Tenders, The Mac-Daddy Mac and Chees, Styler’s Off-the-Hook Fish Sticks and a made-from-scratch Oreo shake or Roxtar’s root beer float. Kids also get a special activity pack with Crayons and pages to color and awesome guitar-shaped plates.", "external_links": ["http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/hollywood-on-hollywood-blvd/"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:42:32.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
