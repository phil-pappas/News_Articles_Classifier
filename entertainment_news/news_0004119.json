The Global Pay TV Operator Forecasts report estimates that 29 operators had more than 5 million paying subs by end-2014.\nChina Radio & TV is the world's largest pay TV operator by a long, long way. Government policy to consolidate cable TV means that China Radio & TV quickly became the world's largest pay TV operator, with 198 million subs by end-2014. The operator will soon represent every cable TV home in China , with 252 million subscribers expected by 2020 – up by nearly 54 million on 2014.\nFollowing China Radio & TV, IPTV operators China Telecom and BesTV will add 14.7 million and 13.2 million subs respectively. In fact, 12 operators from China and India will collectively add 130 million subscribers between 2014 and 2020.\nGlobal subscriber growth is all the more impressive as 79 (23%) of the 338 operators will lose subscribers between 2014 and 2020. Korea's CJ Hellovision will lose the most (827,000 subs), followed by Germany's Unitymedia (down by 592,000) and Romania's RCS-RDS (down 477,000). Very broadly, pay TV operators in Asia Pacific's emerging markets will see strong growth, with North America and Western Europe suffering.\nDespite adding 200 million subscribers between 2014 and 2020, subscription and VOD revenues for the 338 operators will remain flat at $183 billion . From the total, 34 pay TV operators earned more than $1 billion in subscription and VOD revenues in 2014.\nThe dominance of China and India is diminished when the operators are ranked in subscriptions and VOD revenue terms. Led by DirecTV (now owned by AT&T, which owned three of the top 10 operators by revenues in 2014), the US will take six of the top 10 positions in both 2014 and 2020.\nChina Radio & TV will add a massive $2.16 billion between 2014 and 2020. In fact, five operators will add more than $500 million in revenues. However, 97 operators (29%) will lose revenues, with Comcast (down by $4.6 billion ) declining by the most – followed by Time Warner (down $2.3 billion ) and DirecTV (down $1.8 billion ).\nPublished in October 2015 , this 184-page electronically-delivered report comes in two parts:\n• A 58-page PDF giving a global executive summary, international pay TV operator analysis, rankings and forecasts.\n• An excel workbook giving comparison tables, full rankings and country-by-country forecasts in detail for 338 operators (subscribers and subscription & VOD revenues) across 89 territories for every year from 2010 to 2020.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3322574/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/global-pay-tv-operator-forecasts-300160861.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR29620&Transmission_Id=201510151745PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR29620&DateId=20151015", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-pay-tv-operator-forecasts-300160861.html", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3322574/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:24:25.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
