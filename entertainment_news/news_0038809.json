Photo: Greg Piper \n\nDAVID ROSETZKY: UNTITLED PORTRAITS \n\nDavid Rosetzky has long used the more youthful, urbane and good-looking among us as a lens through which to explore ideas of human complexity and the nature of self and identity. His films read like high-end lifestyle advertisements, only abstracted to the point of tension and disorientation – circular dialogues, choreographies and recurring gestures creating strange feedback loops of meaning. This new collection of collaged and otherwise destabilised portraits recalls earlier photo-based works, with Rosetzky cutting, layering and punctuating a series of otherwise straightforward photographs to essentially become patchworks – with subjects echoing and bleeding into their neighbouring protagonists. Lines and oblique sections are dissected and removed, only to be replaced by others. A section of olive skin becomes freckled; a T-shirt becomes a sweater; the surface of the image buckles and shifts. While there is a certain sense of rupture to these works, grace and poise are the dominating qualities. Likewise, Rosetzky's series of accompanying monochrome double-exposure works – which layer portraits of the same cast of characters with more intimate textures – gently hint towards the artist's oft-explored motifs of polite plurality and desire. The only issue is that the young and the good-looking can get a little tiresome; their gorgeous pouts and plaintive stares speak of distinctly first world problems.\n\nUntil November 7; Sutton Gallery, 254 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, 9416 0727, suttongallery.com.au \nCHARLES 'CHICK' BUTCHER & COBI COCKBURN: ASCENT INTO DARKNESS  \n\nAt first glance, Charles 'Chick' Butcher and Cobi Cockburn's series of new works might seem cold and minimalist. Presented as diptychs, the couple's works assume a serialised form, with Cockburn's using meticulous, geometric line-work, blackened and opaque glass to create various illusions of depth and tunnel-like motifs, and Butcher creating various geometric patterns in red on an inky-black backdrop. But the devil is in the detail – that both Butcher and Coburn's works are made with kiln-formed glass gives these works a completely different quality. Close up, the evidence of hand crafting and fastidiousness of technique is obvious. Where minimalism's strength is often also its biggest downfall, this series of pairings – curated by Sandy Benjamin OAM – revels in the tension of the unhindered form and the artists' mark. \nUntil October 31; Fehily Contemporary, 3a Glasshouse Road, Collingwood, 9017 0860, fehilycontemporary.com.au \nWork by Danae Valenza. \nEYE SCORE: THE AUDIBLE IMAGE \n\nThough its title tends towards unwieldy pun rather than clever turn of phrase, Eye Score: The Audible Image proves a tightly curated and realised exploration of visual art that broaches the idea of representing sound and music. There are varying modes, styles and approaches at play here. Angela Cavalieri's sprawling text paintings conjure a kind of expressionistic monologue, while Michael Gleave's large minimalist paintings and John Aslanidis' large circular networks of textures and patterns summon interlocked soundwaves and shifting tones. John Nixon's propositional score, Colour Music – which assumes the form of a series of compact panels riddled with solid blocks of colour, alongside a colour-coded organ – and Dylan Martorell's diagrammatic studies of the sonic potential of particular domestic objects and makeshift instruments are more pragmatic and, perhaps, successful as evocative devices. Danae Valenza's Sound Paintings offer something of a playful, performative twist. She creates gestural photographic collages featuring disembodied hands, contorted to form the shape of guitar, double bass and piano chords – that are quite literal visual fragments of the music-making process. \nAdvertisement Until November 1; Town Hall Gallery, Hawthorn Arts Centre, 360 Burwood Road, Hawthorn, 9278 4626, townhallgallery.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:30:51.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
