It is definitely a ‘plus’ to all those budding film makers who can learn from such miserable mistakes. However, it seems like every department involved in the making of this film suffered from one or the other phobia, which curtailed them from using their brains. The man behind this story that revolves around phobias- Ritesh, who is also one of the producers backed by Yograj Bhat, has done his best by taking it to another intolerable level as an actor too. The sad state of affairs, here is with regard to one of the finest actors of Indian film industry – Anant Nag, who despite his complete honesty and his immense acting ability fails to lift the film, the script from boredom. It is a flat tyre with so many holes that no amount of air can inflate it, even for a while! So, why is it such a bad one? Well, it opens up with a scene in which a director is narrating a story to a producer, with an action sequence far away from our mother Earth. This is enough to blow your mind away. The striking imagination continues when a connection is made with few characters on Earth. The only relief is Anant Nag in his makeover avatar – handsome and charming – so much that he can easily put any young hero who believes in six-packs rather the real stuff, to shame. The first half is the basically about few characters including the protagonist’s (Anant Nag) son played by Chetan Chandra and two others – who are suffering from different kinds of phobia. One suffers from misophonia (a disorder pertaining to certain sounds that can drive someone into a burst of rage or disgust; another from narcissistic personality disorder, a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance and the third portrayed by a female character, with the widely known disorder – hemophobia. With the help of these disorders, the protagonist plans the murder of three of his close associates. Why? Take a chance and find out by inflicting the pain of watching it. Plus it may also be the cause of creating new kinds of disorders posing questions to psychiatrists.
