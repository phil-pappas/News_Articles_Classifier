The team listed him as questionable for Sunday’s road game against the Detroit Lions.\nBennett was his usual upbeat self in the locker room after Thursday’s practice and gave no indication he was hurt. But he was not present in the locker room for Friday’s media session, leaving some considerable uncertainty about the situation.\nIf Bennett can’t play against the winless Lions, it would be another setback for a passing attack that hopes to get receivers Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) and Eddie Royal (ankle) back Sunday. They also were listed as questionable.\nBears expect better passing attack when Alshon Jeffery returns Rich Campbell As Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery nears his return from an injured hamstring, the club is optimistic about the impact he could have on a passing attack that has been limited at times during his four-game absence with reserve receivers sometimes providing a lift.\n“We’re going to be able to open things...\nAs Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery nears his return from an injured hamstring, the club is optimistic about the impact he could have on a passing attack that has been limited at times during his four-game absence with reserve receivers sometimes providing a lift.\n“We’re going to be able to open things...\n(Rich Campbell) Bennett, a Pro Bowler last season, has continued his premier role as a receiver while Jeffery has missed the last four games. He leads the Bears with 28 catches and two receiving touchdowns, and his 233 receiving yards rank second.\nOn Thursday, offensive coordinator Adam Gase lauded how Bennett helps him adjust their approach between series, citing the fourth quarter of last Sunday’s win over the Chiefs.\n“He does such a great job of coming back to the sideline, communicating with me about what possibly could pop free,” Gase said. “So when you have a player of his ability, plus the knowledge of the game that he does, it’s rare to find — and it makes my job a lot easier as far as being able to help him be put in a situation to get him open.”\nJeffery’s possible return against the Lions would help mitigate Bennett’s absence. Fox was asked Friday if this was Jeffery’s best week of practice since injuring his hamstring Sept. 17.\n“Probably,” Fox said. “You’d have to ask him that. We’re just trying to progress him along. You’d think time heals it, probably, but you’d have to ask him that.”\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Martellus Bennett Alshon Jeffery Detroit Lions John Fox Chicago Bears Adam Gase", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200cdc/turbine/ct-bears-jeffery-injury-spt-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562149a2/turbine/ct-bears-lions-martellus-bennett-misses-practice-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:24:55.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
