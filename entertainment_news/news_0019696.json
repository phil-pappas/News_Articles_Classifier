The actress, who is very selective about her projects, does a Malayalam film only once every two years. But just for this year, she's taken on two films opposite Mammootty â€”- Bhaskar The Rascal and an AK Sajan directorial.\nAsk the director what prompted Nayan to take up the second project and Sajan explains, \"She read the script and she immediately said 'yes' because it was peppy and very different from the roles she has done so far in Malayalam films.\"\nThe story is about an urban inter-caste couple and their problems after marriage. \"Mammootty's character in the film, Louis Pothen, almost mirrors his real life personality. He's an easy-going lawyer, who is also a film critic and has a socialist leaning. However, Nayanthara's character, Vasuki, is diametrically opposite,\" says Sajan.\nThe shooting of the film is progressing in Kochi with a cast comprising just 10 members including Rachana Narayanankutty. Incidentally, Mammootty will head to the USA on October 5 for a short personal trip and the team is busy canning all his scenes before he leaves.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:38:41.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
