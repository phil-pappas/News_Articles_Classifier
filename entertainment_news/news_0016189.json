And she said, 'You just got it. You got exactly that fear and that excitement I had.'\nColm Toibin \"I don't think I realised it in the moment, but what I did with this performance is channel my mom,\" she added.\nThe film is based on the book of the same name by Colm Toibin and tells the story of a young woman who moves from small-town Ireland to Brooklyn, New York but returns home following a family tragedy.\nUpon her return, she ends up torn between her old and new life and the men in both worlds.\nWhile the film is set in the 1950s, Saoirse feels like it has a feminist undertone.\n\"To see a character like her, set at that time and not have it be solely about the men in her life, that's pretty feminist,\" she told the Awardsdaily.com website.\n\"Every single woman in this film is strong and independent and yet feminism couldn't flourish back then.\"\nSaoirse & Monica Ronan The 21-year-old's performance is already garnering an Oscar buzz and she is set to receive the New Hollywood gong at the Hollywood Film Awards next month.\nMeanwhile, Brooklyn won the top audience award at the Vancouver Film Festival over the weekend.\nThere was also good news for Lenny Abrahmson's upcoming film, Room, which was named best Canadian feature.\nThe movie is an Irish-Canadian co-production.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:44:45.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
