Tania Willis reports.   \nStars Helen Mirren and Bryan Cranston hit the red carpet for the premiere of their film 'Trumbo' in London on Thursday. The movie is about a screenwriter and his friends who get blacklisted from Hollywood for their political beliefs. Mirren jokingly revealed what she'd be banned for at the premiere during the London Film Festival. (Soundbite) Actress, Helen Mirren, saying (English): \"... probably for swearing. I always seem to get into trouble for that, um but, you know, general bad behaviour probably.\" The award-winning actress was on top form on the red carpet. And she even mentioned the nickname she has fondly given to her chest. (Soundbite) Actress, Helen Mirren, saying (English): \"That was an invention of the moment, it's not like I've always called them my pleasure pillows. It was something I made up on the spot.\" 'Breaking Bad' star Bryan Cranston shared his own views on blacklisting, saying it should be up to society to decide who gets sidelined. (Soundbite) Actor, Bryan Cranston, saying (English): \"I think society creates their own sense of blacklist and I think that's fairer than to have a government do it. For instance an actor who turns out out be a paedophile, it's like society will take care of that. I think on its own, don't you think?\" 'Trumbo' opens in UK cinemas on October 8.  //reut.rs/1ZoBiIm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:12:16.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
