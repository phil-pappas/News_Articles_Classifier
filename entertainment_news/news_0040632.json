A splendid ‘Swan Lake’ 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Despite the recent change in leadership and the loss of top dancers, Ballet San Antonio has managed to bring to the stage a splendid “Swan Lake,” the first ever production of the iconic ballet by a San Antonio company. It opened Friday at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts .\n“Swan Lake” is a beautiful fantasy or a fairy tale, if you will, but in its essence it’s a story that eternally appeals to the human mind — a story of love at first sight, of seemingly insurmountable obstacles for the lovers and a tragic but redeeming ending. In other words, it’s irresistible, especially when told through Tchaikovsky’s gorgeous music and spectacular dancing.\nBallet San Antonio chose to present the version created by internationally known choreographer Ben Stevenson , now artistic director of Texas Ballet Theater in Fort Worth/Dallas, which condenses the story a bit without affecting the overall impact. At the heart of it all is Prince Siegfried, who wanders into the woods following a festive gathering in his castle’s courtyard and encounters Odette, a maiden turned into a swan by the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart ( Jason Cox ). The spell can only be broken by a man who swears to love her forever, forsaking all others. Siegfried is instantly smitten.\nPortraying the two protagonists, principal dancers Ian Morris and Sally Turkel were in top form on opening night. She embodied the vulnerability and fragility of Odette with spun-sugar lightness and swan-like grace. He displayed a noble confidence as he partnered his new love throughout the poignant choreography of their lakeside encounter.\nThere were too many lyrical moments to describe here, from her way of folding her “wings” while bent down low on the ground and her soft pirouettes in his arms to his elegant leaps and the airy lifts.\nIn Act II, Turkel seemed to be somewhat less natural in the role of Odile, Rothbart’s wily daughter who shows up looking like Odette at Siegfried’s birthday celebration at the palace. The sorcerer has transformed her to pose as Odette and seduce the prince. Nevertheless, the two dancers were again in sync, and their dazzling pas de deux, complete with the obligatory series of fouetés by the ballerina, won a huge hand from the audience.\nThough the attention is on the lovers, the ballet also features a large — I counted 16 — group of swans who often frame the protagonists and also dance most charmingly by themselves, as well as various divertissements that are part of just about all classical ballets. Among the latter, a pas de trois danced by Carly Hammond , Kate Maxted and Jose Gonzalez stood out in Act I, and the mazurka and czardas dancers enlivened the birthday celebration in Act II. The folksy, vigorous polka also was a winner.\nThough the set design by David Walker was on the modest side, probably because of financial constraints, it worked well enough, with smooth scene transitions that served the story well. And the San Antonio Symphony , conducted by Akiko Fujimoto , provided a sterling, expressive accompaniment to the stage action.\n“Swan Lake” repeats at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday at the Tobin Center for the Perfomring Arts . 210-223-8624, tobi.tobincenter.org\nJasmina Wellinghoff writes about the arts", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/12/8770229/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/12/8770229/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:16:44.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
