According to a report from CBS Sports, Taylor suffered a sprained MCL in his knee when he was horse-collar tackled by Titans linebacker Zach Brown on his 24-yard scramble in the fourth quarter at Tennessee. Taylor left the game for one play, and returned to lead the Bills to the game-winning touchdown.\nAfter the game, Taylor was not limping, and he said he was fine, but Monday, coach Rex Ryan made it very clear that his quarterback was banged up.\n\"I can tell you this, he is beat up right now,\" Ryan said. \"Like he’s sore, you oughta see him, he is sore. We knew he would be. He hasn’t been 100 percent all season, he’s had an ankle. Even through training camp, we really haven’t seen the 100 percent Tyrod Taylor. We all know he finished the game, but we’ll see. We’ll see how he’s doing. We’ll be looking at him throughout the week and everybody else that we have.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills cut kicker Billy Cundiff, sign QB Josh Johnson\nIf the report about Taylor's knee is accurate, it seems like it would be very difficult for Taylor to play as sprained MCL's are typically at least a two-week injury. If Taylor can't play, EJ Manuel will start against the Bengals.\nThe Bills are concerned enough about Taylor's status to the extent that they signed veteran free agent quarterback Josh Johnson Tuesday, and one of the reasons Johnson was brought in, beyond his availability, is that he has a valid passport. The Bills travel to London Monday for their game next Sunday against Jacksonville.\nTo make room on the 53-man roster, kicker Billy Cundiff was released. Cundiff was brought in last week to replace kickoff specialist Jordan Gay, but in his debut at Tennessee, he failed to produce a touchback in three attempts. Dan Carpenter handled both extra points in the game, and he will continue on in that role. However, Carpenter is not adept at kicking off, so you have to wonder if the Bills will make another roster move to try to bring back Gay.\nJohnson originally entered the NFL in 2008 as a fifth-round pick (160th overall) of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The 6-foot-3, 210-pounder has started in five games and played in 29 in his career, completing 96 of his 177 pass attempts for 1,042 yards, five touchdowns and 10 interceptions in addition to rushing for 274 yards on 44 attempts.\nThe 29-year-old has spent time with the Buccaneers, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Jets and most recently the Indianapolis Colts.\nThis year, Johnson was in training camp with the Bengals and completed 11 of 21 passes for 175 yards in the one game he played. He was cut and signed by the Jets and completed 7 of 12 passes for 82 yards while rushing for 76 yards for New York before being released. The Colts then signed him when Andrew Luck was down, but later cut him. Now his whirlwind trip has landed him in Buffalo, and the fact that he was with the Bengals could prove to be useful with Cincinnati in town this week.\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nTyrod Taylor's late heroics bail out Bills\nBills quarterback Tyrod Taylor (5) reacts after being hit during the first half.
