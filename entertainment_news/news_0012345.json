The duo only performed the legendary move on the day it was shot, she said.\n\"Never rehearsed it, never done it since,\" Grey divulged to the outlet. \"I don't know how all these people who re-eact it have the guts to throw themselves into the arms of anyone other than Patrick Swayze. It's insane!\"\nGrey doesn't intend to do it again, either, saying she was begged to try the move again during her time on Dancing With The Stars in 2010. \"It's a non-starter. It happened, enjoy it, watch it over and over again but never ask me to do it again because I'm too [expletive] old...I have a family and I want to live longer,\" she joked.\nGrey now appears on Amazon Prime's comedy series Red Oaks , set in 1985, alongside Craig Roberts and Richard Kind .\n\n  Brad Pitt's Netflix original movie 'War Machine' to start production in Abu Dhabi Christopher Lloyd would 'love' to do 'Back to the Future 4' Legendary and Warner Bros. to release 'Kong: Skull Island,' 'Godzilla 2,' 'Godzilla vs. Kong'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:01:45.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
