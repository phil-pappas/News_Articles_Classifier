Specific topics include medical cannabis, pot's role in creative thinking (or in its demise), its potential as a major U.S. industry, and long-standing views that it's a gateway drug that leads young people into addiction, crime and despair. \n\"California is on the verge of making important decisions around marijuana that will impact people living in this state,\" says Kelly McKinley, Director of the OMCA Lab. \"OMCA is a place where people can come together to learn, question, and add their voice to the different points of view around this topic at a very critical time in public decision making.\" Advertisement \nThe exhibition will explore these topics with interactive displays using data, expert voices and diverse viewpoints. \n\"Altered States\" runs April 16-September 25 in this museum's Great Hall, http://museumca.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:36:08.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
