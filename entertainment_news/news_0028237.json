Johnny is still wearing the pirate's gold tooth as he's recently been filming the fifth in the Pirates franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales. \nJohnny's American accent also slips into some rogue Captain Jack as we chat. \n\"Oh Jack?\" he mimics. \"It does come about every now and again.\" \nJohnny Depp laughs when asked if he finds talk of his role as Black Mass' James 'Whitey' Bulger being a comeback, as flattering or insulting. \n\"What did I come back from? The dead?\" he chuckles. \"I haven't done anything different in this than I have in any other film.\" Image caption Director Scott Cooper, Benedict Cumberbatch, London Film Festival director Clare Stewart, Johnny Depp and producer John Lesher \nBack to those Oscar whispers then. \n\"The idea of winning means that you're in competition with someone and I'm not in competition with anybody,\" says Johnny. \n\"I just stick to my guns and do what I want to do. Sometimes people don't like it but that's alright.\" \nThe list of who is in the running for next year's Academy Awards won't be revealed until January. \nBlack Mass, which also stars Benedict Cumberbatch, is out in the UK on 27 November. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:57:06.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
