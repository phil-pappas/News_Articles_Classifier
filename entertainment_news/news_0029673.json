Danielle creates love between two wounded souls in ‘His Perfect One’\nMIAMI (PRWEB) October 05, 2015\nIn search of the epitome of love, Devin – a wounded BDSM dominant – crosses paths with Aria, the perfect girl next door, in author J.S. Danielle ’s new erotic novel, “ His Perfect One ” (published by Trafford Publishing).\nDevin is a master to women and lover of the female form until the one closest to him leaves. He dives headfirst into his work, leery of all things female. Angry, antisocial and a bit outspoken, he’s very protective of his heart and has all but given up on finding love.\nAria is beautiful, intelligent and feisty. She thought she had found her perfect man, but when it turns out she is sadly mistaken, she reaches out for a solution from her best friend who’s found solace in a local BDSM establishment. Can she be the perfect one to expose the large heart Devin has kept suppressed for more than five years?\n“Even if you’ve never tried a quarter of the things discussed in the book, you’re drawn in and a willing participant in its hypnotism,” Danielle says. “The sex in this book isn’t raunchy or distasteful; it has a sense of passion and care a lot of erotic books do not.”\nDanielle hopes readers will get to know her cast of characters – including their faults and issues – and fall in love with all of them.\n“His Perfect One”\nBy J.S.
