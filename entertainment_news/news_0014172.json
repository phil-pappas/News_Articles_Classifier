Image 17 of 17 Chef David Guerrero’s bright new days 1 / 17 Back to Gallery \nOnly weeks ago chef David Guerrero wrote a post on Facebook updating his friends on his ongoing recovery from a second surgery to remove a brain tumor. \"This fourth round of chemo has really kicked my a**,\" he wrote. \"I feel sick and weak, but still working hard.\" He ended on a positive note: \"Tomorrow is a new exciting day, new menu and new opportunity.\" \nTrue on all accounts. Guerrero, looking fine and in good spirits during a recent visit to his Andes Café , the Latin American foods restaurant at 2311 Canal, has reason to be excited about his new tomorrows. \nFirst, the \"new opportunity\": He is acting as a consultant for a new project called Tapas & Rumba, a lounge, bar and grill that is being planned for 13525 Westheimer by the former owners of Carruseles Discoteca, a Colombian nightclub. Guerrero said he is working on a menu of international tapas for the project that may result in a partnership beyond consulting. Tapas & Rumba could open as soon as December, he said. \nNext, the \"new menu\": Fried guinea pig, anyone? Yes, guinea pig – a dish popular in Peru and in Guerrero's native Ecuador – is among about a dozen new menu items the chef recently added to the Café Andes menu. He believes he's the only restaurant in Houston, or in Texas for that matter, to serve the species of rodent. \nCalled cuy, guinea pig has been a staple of Peru's Andean diet for about 5,000 years. It is also part of Ecuadoran cuisine, served roasted, stewed, baked or fried. But the most popular version is cuy roasted on a rotisserie. \nGuerrero, who sources the natural, grass-fed guinea pig from Peru, calls his dish Cuy Chactado, which is a classic, deep-fried version popular in Peru. The chef's preparation involves a marinade of cumin, garlic and oregano as well as a paste of aji mirasol, a Peruvian chile pepper. The animal is roasted and then deep fried until the skin is crisped \"like suckling pig.\" It is cut into pieces and served on a platter (that feeds two) with blistered corn, roasted potatoes, an aji cream sauce and a salsa criolla of red onion, lime, yellow aji and cilantro. The chef says the guinea pig meat taste like rabbit. He adds that while the cuy arrives at his kitchen dressed whole, it is butchered before preparation. \"I can't present it like we do in our country with the head and claws,\" Guerrero said. \nThe cuy ($60 for two; which must be pre-ordered by reservation) isn't the only new dish on the menu that inspired by the foods of Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina. On the breakfast menu customers will find Mote Pillo con Carne (Ecuador), pan-seared skirt steak served with eggs scrambled with hominy; Tigrillo (Ecuador), fried mashed green plantains mixed with mozzarella and pork belly topped with two sunny side up eggs; and Desayuno Peruano (Peru), steamed spinach tamales and pork belly with fried sweet potatoes. \nSmall plates and larger signature plates include Mollejas (Argentina), pan-seared sweet breads on a bed of melted cheese; Saltena de Carne (Bolivia), a savory pastry filled with beef, peas, eggs, olives, raisins and potatoes; Silpancho (Bolivia), breaded sirloin steak served over rice and roasted potatoes topped with two sunny side up eggs; and Pescado a la Lata (Chile), baked salmon on a bed of white onions and sausage topped with parmesan cheese and served with roasted potatoes. \nGuerrero's goal was to offer more brunch and breakfast items while also balancing out the menu in terms of South American influence by adding more dishes from Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. The cuy, though, is the most significant menu addition. \n\"I just want to show our culture,\" the chef said. \"I'm not here to show you how to eat, I just want you to enjoy.\" \nThese changes – including hiring a new executive chef, Francisco Fonseco, and a new sous chef, Ivan Ortiz – comes as Café Andes approaches its two-year anniversary in December. Guerrero recalls a chef friend telling him he was crazy to open a restaurant in EaDo. \"You won't last three months,\" Guerrero said, repeating his friend's warning. \nBut the restaurant his endured hardships, including Guerrero's own medical crisis – a risky surgery earlier this year to remove a second brain tumor and subsequent chemotherapy. Guerrero, whose friends and culinary buddies have pitched in to help him pay his medical bills, remains obsessed with work. \n\"A lot of times I don't feel well. But I tell everyone I don't have time to be sick. I just want to do well,\" he said. \"I'm not a weak person. God gave me that. I know I have a purpose in life. I don't have time to feel pity. I just keep going.\" \nSo does Andes Cafe. And now that EaDo's fortunes are on the upswing, Guerrero isn't just proving his doubting friend wrong, he's thriving much like his neighborhood. \n\"When the neighborhood booms, I know my hard work will pay off,\" he said. \n* \nAndes Café, 2311 Canal, #104, 832-659-0063; andescafe.com.
