A stage production if you haven’t seen it, that’s it, but on screen it’s there for good. \n“Also you get in so close on screen you can see what a wonderful actress Dame Maggie is.” (Joel Ryan/AP/PA) \nThe playwright, who is portrayed on screen by Alex Jennings, said the story continues to be as poignant today even after Miss Shepherd’s death. Promoted stories \n“It’s not revisiting in the sense it never really left me. Even today if I hear the front door go, I think it’s Miss Shepherd. It’s ingrained so much into my life.” \nBut he said the real Miss Shepherd would have issues with the film. \nHe explained: “She would probably think she deserves a bigger part because she had a very exaggerated sense of her own importance. She would also want to put over her political and religious views which were very pronounced.” (Ian West/PA) \nThe film marks the second collaboration between Alan and director Nicholas Hytner since The History Boys in 2006. \nThe filmmaker said: “We first did the play in 1999 and neither of us could quite remember why we didn’t make the film then. \n“I’m very glad we did it now because we’ve had time to think about it and Maggie is even more like the lady in the van now the she was 15 years ago.” (Ian West/PA) \nEarlier, Dame Maggie revealed she disliked staying in the van for the duration of the seven-week-long shoot. \nShe said: “It was not very easy being constricted in a van. There is no way you could live in a van, surely not for that length of time. The rest of the cast were in luxury in a real house.” \nNicholas added:”The van was a nightmare for Dame Maggie, hurling herself in and out of that van. \n“The energy that she brings is extraordinary and I used to feel really guilty asking for a second or third take because she’s getting on. \n“She’s 80 and she’s having to hurl herself into the van, run up and down the hill, chase children. The physical energy she brought was quite frightening to watch sometimes. She was pretty brave.” Share article \nThe Lady In The Van opens in cinemas on November 13.
