Especially the parts about infidelity.\nTalese - beacon of the New Journalism - tells us his work-in-progress for Knopf \"will be like the 'War and Peace' of relationships. It's the story of two people who have shared a townhouse for almost half a century and of the city where they lived.\"\nOf course, he notes, \"I have a version of events and she has a version. That's why I have a writer interviewing her. Nan's recollections will be integrated with mine.\"\nSays Nan: \"I haven't been interviewed by anyone. Gay is a wonderful writer and I trust him. But this is his book. I am not a participant in any way whatsoever.\n\"It'll be interesting to see what he knows about marriage,\" she adds. \"I'd like to hear his theories.\"\nHere's one: \"Marriage is not a love story,\" says Gay. \"It's a friendship - a friendship you can't do without. Sex is not important. Sex you can get anywhere.\"\nOh, really? And what about Gay's own first-person investigations into the sex life of America while writing his 1982 best-seller, \"Thy Neighbor's Wife,\" and those who portray Nan as the most tolerant of wives?\n\"I'm tolerant, too,\" says Gay, slyly. \"She has all these wonderful writers who are men. All those long publishing lunches. You never know where she is. This is not a woman living in a nunnery.\"\n\"Those lunches are just business!\" says Nan, when told of her husband's hinting. \"They're interesting writers, that's all! Gay is really bad. This is volume 800 in his catalogue of mischief-making.\n\"Our marriage has been far from 'open.' This speculation [about his infidelity] started when he wrote 'Thy Neighbor's Wife.' The reviewers projected what they'd do in same situation.\"\nGay is also writing an afterword for the 25th anniversary of \"Wife\" (in which he'll delve into Internet porn and the current state of this country's libido.) In addition, the author of \"The Kingdom and the Power\" is teaming with fellow New York Times -chronicler Arthur Gelb to write a film about the Gray Lady, produced by Scott Rudin . And Stanley Tucci is adapting his book, \"Unto the Sons.\"\nSays Nan about Gay: \"I don't think he's had time to think about our marriage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:00:03.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
