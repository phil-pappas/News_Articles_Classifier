Williams will not get the bulk of the run game load, and he currently leads the NFL at 7.75 yards per rush. Watkins will miss his first game since entering the NFL last year, though in those first 19 games, he has almost never been 100 percent healthy.\nThe Bills also announced that safety Aaron Williams, right guard John Miller, and wide receiver Marquise Goodwin won't play.\nWilliams will miss his second straight game due to the neck injury he suffered against the Patriots. Bacarri Rambo will start again in his place. Miller hurt his groin in Miami, and Kraig Urbik will step in as the starter. And Goodwin remains out with a rib injury, even though he started to do more in practice this week.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills enjoying early success in red zone\nSal Maiorana and Leo Roth preview the Bills-Giants game Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/3892/36517057001_4524741950001_900-ELI-TYROD.jpg?pubId=36517057001", "http://on.rocne.ws/1KQ2BU8", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/3892/36517057001_4524741950001_900-ELI-TYROD.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/028adbed88c4848644a0113d04c8733a28e0e304/c=228-0-1640-1412/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Rochester/Rochester/635789801047579696-USATSI-8829178.jpg", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/1596/36517057001_4524742655001_180-eli-tyrd.jpg?pubId=36517057001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8bb65a5d1bb033fb967b0c8b034dc8809a877a82/r=540&c=540x304/http/bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201510/3892/36517057001_4524741950001_900-ELI-TYROD.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:52:27.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
