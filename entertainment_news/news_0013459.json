Speaking to a crowd of supporters, Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton voiced her opinion about the anti-gay clerk.\nyoutube.com After refusing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in July, Davis found herself sued by four different couples. Continuing to defy a court order, Judge David Bunning found Davis in contempt of court, ordering her to time in a county jail. This issue was discussed by Clinton during an Oct. 7 campaign rally at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, as reported by the International Business Times .\n\"I think what happened to Kim Davis was the right thing,\" Clinton told the crowd, noting that the Kentucky clerk was punished for not doing the job she was elected to do. \"She violated the law, and therefore she was arrested,\" Clinton said, mentioning that Davis agreed to uphold the Constitution, but failed to do so and was treated how she should have been treated. \"I actually think that she was treated as she should have been treated.\"\n\"When you take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, that is your job. You either enforce the law or you resign from your public position. That is exactly what should have happened.\"\nFollowing her release from jail , Davis was greeted by hundreds of conservative Christian supporters, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Despite a court order mandating she not interfere with future marriage licenses in her county, Davis was found removing her name and the county name off of marriage forms. Davis also found herself in a controversial situation when she met with Pope Francis during his U.S. visit last month, where her lawyer, Mat Staver, implied the meeting was the pontiff's endorsement. The Vatican has since denied the pope's endorsement of Davis.", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-kim-davis-jailing-kentucky-clerk-was-right-thing-2131795", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kentucky-clerk-kim-davis-released-from-jail/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/30/the-murky-details-of-kim-daviss-alleged-secret-meeting-with-pope-francis/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:42:27.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
