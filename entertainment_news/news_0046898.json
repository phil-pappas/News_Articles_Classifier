Long floaty dresses and tops, a Chloe staple, were also on show in white, pastel and rainbow colors, with tassels swinging at the front and on the sides. Footwear consisted of colorful sandals with multiple straps. \nFashionistas said Chloe, known of late for its 1970s-inspired designs, was nodding to the 1990s for next spring. \n“We saw the great classics, the real trademark looks of the label, the bohemian and diaphanous side,” said French model and actress Aymeline Valade. \n“At the same time, there was something new that she has incorporated in this collection, the more sporty style, with chic tracksuits and the very casual chic.” \n(Reporting By Sophie Kinloch and Reuters Television in Paris; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in London; Editing by Kevin Liffey )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:51.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
