Emergency 911 was first notified by Park Rangers on Oct. 11 around 6:30 p.m. regarding a precarious rescue involving a horse near 3400 N. Beachwood Dr. in Los Angeles.\nThe group of rescue specialists quickly set up a protective rope system that permitted the lowering of personnel down to the horse. This enabled them to calm the horse and inspect the animal for injuries. It was promptly decided that the horse’s injuries were superficial, and the decision was made to effect a rescue by helicopter .\nRescuers began to prepare the horse for his aerial transport – they placed cotton balls into the horse’s ears to moderate noise levels, covered the horse’s eyes with a hood to prevent debris and particles getting into them from the downdraft, and administered an initial sedation to keep the horse calm. The rescuers then began to strap the horse into a special airlift harness that was attached to the underside of the helicopter just prior to the lift.\nAt about 9:30 p.m. preparations for the lift were nearing completion, and one of the veterinarians administered a stronger sedative to the horse. By 9:45 p.m. the horse was hoisted off the ground and the airlift as underway. The horse was brought down at a nearby riding stable where additional help took over.\nThis was a very effective, well-orchestrated rescue of a horse that was caught up in a precarious scenario. The operation took a number of hours and required strategic planning to keep both horse and personnel safe. Firefighters worked in close effort from the ground and in the air, adhering to humane animal regulations, with Park Rangers, USAR specialist, and veterinarians. Under the command of battalion chief Dean Zipperman, at least 30 people took “every precaution to provide exceptional care to the horse during this traumatic experience.”\nIt was not made clear just how the horse fell into the ravine or whether he was being ridden at the time of the accident. What is certain, however, is that the horse suffered only minor wounds and is expected to completely heal.", "external_links": ["http://thepublicslate.com/2015/10/rescues-horse-that-fell-in-60-hollywood-hills-ravine/", "http://westsidetoday.com/2015/10/12/los-angeles-firefighters-rescued-a-horse-that-fell-into-a-75-foot-ravine-in-hollywood-hills/", "http://ktla.com/2015/10/11/firefighters-working-to-rescue-horse-that-fell-60-feet-into-hollywood-hills-ravine/", "http://horsetalk.co.nz/2015/10/13/chopper-airlift-horse-hollywood-ravine/#axzz3oU43bRBK"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:53:42.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
