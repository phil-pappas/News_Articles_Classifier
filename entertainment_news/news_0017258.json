Pyaar Hai' sequel\nListen to songs of Shortcut Romeo on Gaana.com\nIncidentally, Kuunal came up with the song's concept. When director Mehul Atha and the actress heard it, they fell in love with it. They are sure today's youth will love this number. It has been shot by a reputed production house that has several hit music videos to its credit, and features leading men Zayed Khan and Saahil Shroff, too.\nAmeesha and her team are also planning a long schedule to a beautiful European destination this November for the movie. The actor-producer jests that the delay in completion is intentional. She explains, \" Kuunal should be blamed for this. He believes that a film's delay doesn't matter. What is important is how the movie shapes up when it's ready for release. In the bargain, he took its scale to another level, both in terms of the look and budget. I'm super happy with the delay.\" They plan to release the film early next year.\n updates\nWATCH: Kareena Kapoor and Ameesha Patel's cat fight! - TOI\nBhool Bhulaiyaa Amazon.in : INR 49.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/album/shortcut-romeo", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GpPTDhbuL._SL160_.jpg", "http://www.amazon.in/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-Akshay-Kumar/dp/B001GRPKE2%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001GRPKE2", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BB_p_lGHHZU", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:23:55.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
