READ MORE: 10 Completely WTF Eamonn Holmes Moments \nThe TV presenter was filming his new Channel 5 show ‘Eamonn & Ruth: How The Other Half Lives’ when the embarrassing incident took place. \nThe show, which the ‘This Morning’ host presents with his wife Ruth Langsford, sees the couple sampling the lives of the rich and famous, including the fancy food they eat. \nEamonn Holmes \nEamonn explained: \"It was a very funny situation and I was served up the most pretentious thing. \n\"It wasn't in normal circumstances and I had to guess what was in my mouth and I panicked a bit. \n\"What was in my mouth foamed up slightly and I spat it out. Anyway, we were basically thrown out because of that. It was haute cuisine and I don't know why I (spat it out).\" \nHis wife Ruth Langsford added: \"They weren't very happy with us.\" \nAnd we thought talking with your mouth full was rude. \nEamonn with his wife Ruth Langsford \nHowever, despite being asked to leave the posh eaterie, Eamonn remained unimpressed with the pretentious food he was asked to sampled. \n\"But come on,” he added. “I just wanted to stop and say 'Are you kidding here?'. \n“The amount was thousands of pounds for a melt in the mouth thing and I really just thought 'Get over yourself'. How can you, in a real world, say that this is somehow worthwhile doing?\" \nThe series will also see the couple travelling around the globe to meet some of the world’s richest inhabitants. \n\"We genuinely thought we were embarking on a mission to meet a series of knobs,\" Eamonn said. \n\"You just thought they would be flash, bling, stupid, undeserving - whatever. And just time after time after time, people just won us over with their charm and their respect and their dedication.\" \nEamonn & Ruth: How the Other Half Lives airs Thursday October 27 at 9pm on Channel 5. Close   Holmes caused a bit of upset when he asked female sex addict, Crystal Warren, why she hadn't turned to prostitution after she admitted she'd bedded over 1000 men. \"If you need this five or six times a day, have you never thought about making a business of it? Charging for it?\" Eamonn enquired. \"I mean if you are not particularly selective, what I'm saying is, why wouldn't it be a business to you?\" he added, before settling down into the large pit he'd just excavated. The saucy Irishman couldn't keep his hands off his wife, fellow TV presenter Ruth Langsford, during a 'This Morning' debate about whether public displays of affection could go too far. As the cameras cut back to the couple, they were caught in a racy embrace as Eamonn grabbed Ruth's boob and lent in for a kiss. Controversial columnist Samantha Brick looked momentarily tongue-tied when Holmes looked her dead in the eye and asked her if she believed she was beautiful. It came after Brick wrote a column in which she described her experiences of sexual harassment. Recovering her composure, Brick answered: \"Do I think I'm attractive? Yes, I do.\" When Holmes pressed her, asking her hypothetically how many men out of ten would fancy her at a dinner party, Brick turned coy and refused to answer before quipping: \"All of them Eamon!\" Holmes mocked fellow presenter Jonathan Wilkes on 'This Morning' after he said he was not very knowledgeable about the UK’s geography. The incident – which was laughed about on air – occurred during a newspaper review section of the show. As they discussed a poll in which a third of Britons said they didn’t know where London, Birmingham and Glasgow are, Wilkes joked he was “in that third”. For all his missteps, Holmes has perfected the ability to cope with, erm, demanding interviewees. In a recent excruciating exchange, the Irish presenter battled a really angry David Cassidy, with the help of his wife Ruth. Creepy trickster David Blane frightened the entire 'GMTV' audience with his silent interview in 2005. Holmes coped admirably, easily making light of the weird encounter. The daytime TV presenter was hosting a health phone-in with wife Ruth Langsford and medic Dr Dawn Harper out on the Southbank in London, when a rogue gust of wind blew over a potted plant behind her. While Ruth bore the brunt of the encounter, Holmes shrugged it off. It’s usually Eamonn Holmes’ cheeky banter with his wife Ruth Langsford that raises a smile on ‘This Morning’, but breakfast TV’s favourite Irishman got fans talking for a different reason on the show. The presenter debuted a dashing new look, when he sported a white suit. During a 2009 Sky News interview, Eamonn Holmes mistook a man for a woman. While the interview wasn't in person but rather down the line via a monitor, the moment still caused embarrassment. When Fathers For Justice campaigners stomed the National Lottery 'In It To Win It' studios, Holmes made an understandably swift exit stage left...  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:28:23.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
