Comment Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 8:56 AM By Carol Bronson Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 8:56 AM Pratt A pop singer from the 1960s sings the old favorites and tours in the Midwest. Frankie Valens will perform a concert in Pratt next week, sponsored by the Lions Club to celebrate the memory of Jack Ewing, “the Pratt emcee.” Other sponsors include Edward Jones (Dakota Holtgrieve), Pratt Real Estate and Pratt Tree Farm. Some in the Pratt area have heard Valens. He appeared at least twice at Sawyer Christian Church family nights and at a sausage supper and was at a church in Pratt a few years ago — he thinks it was First Baptist, where he had an unusual experience. People kept leaving during the concert, surely discouraging for an artist, but then they came back with friends and relatives. One person told him, “If I’d known you were this good, I would have invited my mother.” Bill Proctor, who formerly booked acts for the Wilmore Opry in Comanche County, and now a resident of Pratt, spearheaded the drive to get Valens and his wife Phyllis for the performance in Pratt. In 1967, Frank Piper, an accountant in New Jersey, was invited to audition as lead singer for the band, Eminent Domain. They signed him on, after hearing his rendition of “Unchained Melody.” For a time, he kept up with both his full-time accounting job and weekend band performances. An agent advised him to take the stage name Frankie Valens, as a tribute to performer Ritchie Valens, who had died in a 1959 plane crash. To shorten the story, Frankie Valens and the band became popular in nightclubs in the United States and Canada and he made several recordings, most notably, “This Magic Moment,” originally recorded by The Drifters. In 1971, his career and his marriage fell apart and he moved to Colorado and became Frank Piper the accountant again. He met his current wife Phyllis as a member of the church choir she directed. She didn’t know he was Frankie Valens until after she married him. They started performing in local churches, did a concert here and there, and have been touring for 18 years. Phyllis is not only his accompanist but an accomplished concert pianist. She will entertain with a variety of styles including ragtime, patriotic and inspirational music. She also joins Frankie in singing some of the “oldies” duets. Health issues forced them into retirement in 2008, and they began a year-and-a-half ministry at the First Christian Church in Syracuse, where his father had pastored years earlier. They’re back in the music ministry now; it’s supposed to be part-time, but they find themselves on the road almost full time. They now live in Derby.
