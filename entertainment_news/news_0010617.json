While Edgar serves in France, Mary dreams of a life in Paris as a chanteuse. \nInstead, she joins a travelling enlistment show with a blind soldier poet, a veteran of Gallipoli, as the main attraction. \nThe final show is at the Drill Hall and the mysterious singer who narrates the entertainment in song is supported by L'Orchestre du Music Hall. \nThe Ballad of Edgar and Mary is a musical theatre show commissioned by the Drill Hall Theatre Company, with assistance from the Federal Government's Anzac Centenary Grant Program. \nThe show was co-written and directed by Claude Gonzalez, twice nominated for an Australian Film Institute Award and an IF Award, and Gregory Aitken an actor and producer who has enjoyed 22 years of theatre work on the Northern Rivers. \nMr Aitken said the piece was a work of fiction. \n\"By making it a fiction story we had free rein to take the characters in any way we wanted to,\" he said. \"It's not a true story but it was influenced by our reading of letters between local soldiers and their families.\" \nMr Aitken said the piece was not political, but conceded that it contained a small degree of commentary about war. \n\"I think it's impossible to write a piece about World War I and not to have a political point of view,\" he said. \n\"It speaks for itself that millions of people were slaughtered and the repercussions of that are still going on today. The songs used in the piece are all from the era, offering a rare insight into the musical background of the war time. \n\"For some reason, that era was very strong creatively. Every song in the show was composed between 1914 and 1919.\" \nAt the Drill Hall, 2 Jubilee Ave, Mullumbimby, from tomorrow until October 25.
