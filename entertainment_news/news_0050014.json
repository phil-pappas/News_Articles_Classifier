Sam Smith's 007 theme 'Writing's On the Wall' becomes first Bond song to top UK singles chart Posted Oct 2, 2015 1:40 pm EDT Last Updated Oct 2, 2015 at 2:20 pm EDT \nLONDON – Sam Smith’s 007 theme has gone straight to No. 1 — the first James Bond song to top the U.K. singles chart. \n“Writing’s On the Wall” features in spy thriller “SPECTRE,” released later this month. \nThe Official Charts Company, which compiles the bestseller list, said Friday that the song moved 70,000 copies in sales and streaming in its first week, beating Justin Bieber’s “What Do You Mean” to the top spot. \nIt is Smith’s fifth No. 1 single in Britain. \nPrevious Bond films have featured songs by Adele, Paul McCartney, Madonna, Shirley Bassey and others. None has been a British chart-topper, although Duran Duran’s “A View to a Kill” and McCartney’s “Live and Let Die” were top 10 hits. \nAdele’s “Skyfall” theme won both a Grammy and an Academy Award.
