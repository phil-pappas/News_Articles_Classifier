A tomahawk used by a Native American giving up his land. A painting of a former slave market. \nMayor Bill de Blasio (dih BLAH'-zee-oh) and his wife, Chirlane McCray, are installing new artwork at Gracie Mansion that they say depicts the full history of New York City. \nThe artwork at the mayoral mansion was put on display Friday. \nThe new exhibit is called \"Windows on the City\" and is meant to capture life in New York in 1799. That's when the mansion was built. \nDe Blasio and McCray are committed to diversifying the subjects featured in the mansion's artwork. \nThe exhibit also contains the original Gradual Emancipation Act of 1799, which began the process of ending slavery in New York. \nPublic tours begin Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:19:47.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
