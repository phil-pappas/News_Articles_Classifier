The threesome were spotted leaving their home in Queens, New York on Wednesday afternoon, October 14, to rush to the former NBA star's bedside at the Sunrise Hospital in Nevada. Liza, Destiny, and Lamar Jr. were photographed arriving in Las Vegas alongside Lamar's aunt JaNean Mercer, who had helped to raise the basketball player in Queens after the death of his mother from colon cancer when Lamar was just 12-years-old. The four joined the Kardashian-Jenner family, who are all currently in Vegas as Lamar remains in critical condition. On the same day, Destiny tweeted out a childhood photo of her and her father with the heartbreaking message \"Please don't leave us.\" She has since deleted the tweet though. Lamar and Liza were together for more than 10 years and share three children together: Destiny, Lamar Jr., and Jayden, who died at 6 months old of SIDS in 2006. The exes were engaged at one point and had been locked in a high court battle over custody and child support issues before the tragic events. They were due to appear in court on October 22. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:24:35.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
