Here, the boys go to a nightclub. Photo: Josh Thomas \nJosh Thomas refuses to grow up Josh Thomas has stepped behind the camera for the first time to direct an episode of his sitcom Please Like Me .\nBut the 28-year-old comic actor admitted he had a little help with the big move – from boy band One Direction.\n... and here, Tom, Josh and Arnold go to a nightclub. Photo: Josh Thomas \nThomas told Fairfax journalist Debi Enker he used action figures of the English pop group – Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson (plus former member Zayn Malik) – to work out where to place his characters as he prepared to direct episode four of the third season of his ABC TV series.\nAdvertisement \"I did a One Direction storyboard,\" Thomas explained. \"I asked my boyfriend to get some little dolls for me.

So he got me One Direction [dolls], and Woody and Buzz from Toy Story – the Japanese Woody and Buzz – and I took photos.\"\nThomas stepped up to the plate because regular director Matthew Saville was away in Adelaide shooting the feature film, A Month of Sundays , which is due to open early next year.\nAnd here, Zayn looks on while Harry lies on the floor ... Photo: Josh Thomas \nThomas said he had to be represented by the Niall doll, \"which was disappointing\".\n\"Tom [Thomas Ward] got to be Harry Styles, Zayn was Ella [Emily Barclay], Arnold [Keegan Joyce] was the other one [Louis Tomlinson].\"\nThomas said he had a \"little scrapbook with photos of Harry Styles ... but I lost the book\".\nThe scene in which Tom collapses drunkenly on St Kilda Pier while Ella, Arnold and Josh stand above him.
