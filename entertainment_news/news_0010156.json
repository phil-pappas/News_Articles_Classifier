G. Wells novel of the same name for “The Mercury Theater On The Air” by Orson Welles. The radio audience had been told at the outset that this was only a play, but the production was done breaking news-style with realistic sound effects and “on scene” reporters. \nBecause many in the audience had either tuned in late or did not hear the disclaimer, widespread fear and panic ensued. People were certain that Martians had landed (in Grover’s Mill, N.J.) and were taking over the world. The fallout led to massive publicity for Welles and his theater, and subsequent apologies by CBS and Welles. It has since become a classic. \nCourier Publications columnist Tom Seymour, a seminar speaker, aficionado of wild plants and amateur astronomer, will deliver an introduction of trivia and facts regarding Mars. Marsh River Theater’s rendition of the radio show features five cast members and a sound effects wizard \nTickets are $12, $10 for senior citizens. For more information, call the theater at 722-4110. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
