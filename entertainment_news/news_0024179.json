Video by Matt Adams and Katrina Tulloch. Comments \nSYRACUSE, N.Y. -- If you'll be spending Oct. 31 here in Salt City, consider a Halloween costume which local folks will appreciate. Here are 13 ideas, culled straight from 2015 headlines on Syracuse.com. Impress friends with your originality, or shame them publicly for not keeping up with local news. \n1. Texting juror Here's a simple costume for a young woman, inspired by Johnna Lorraine . Wear a blazer and stay glued to your phone all night. Every once in a while, whisper to a friend that your dad thinks he's guilty and how this case is \"legit crazy.\" #Neulander County Executive Joanie Mahoney holds one of three new Humboldt penguin chicks at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, N.Y., Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2015. Kevin Rivoli | krivoli@syracuse.com \n2. Joanie Mahoney at the zoo Our favorite Onondaga County executive sure loves her photo ops at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Wear your crispest pantsuit, pose for multiple photos with animals (real or stuffed) and drop soundbites about how safe the Lakeview Amphitheater is. \n3. Onondaga Lake jumper , 10 years later In July, dozens of community members jumped into Onondaga Lake to prove it's safe and clean again, but syracuse.com commenters don't believe that for a second. For this costume, just dress as a zombie. Bonus points if you add a third eye and a mutant tail. \n4. New Hartford cow What a journey she had through New Hartford, eluding capture for nearly four months. If you dress as everyone's favorite rogue cow, wander freely through Central New York, eat anything you like and don't talk, just moo. If you see someone dressed as a cowboy, run as far as you can in the opposite direction. \"Tree of 40 Fruits,\" by Sam Van Aken. Included in \"Conceal/Reveal: New Work From the Faculty of the College of Visual and Performing Arts\" exhibit in the SUArt Galleries at Shaffer Art Building at Syracuse University. SUArt Galleries \n5. Frankentree Syracuse University professor Sam Van Aken created the amazing Frankentree Tree of 40 Fruit by grafting different branches with buds onto one tree. Dress up like Frankenstein's monster and carry around 40 different types of fruit. \n6. Fayetteville deer, bait-and-kill hunter Find an antlerless Bambi outfit and roam the streets of Fayetteville until a *certified* archer shoots you with a crossbow . A great costume idea for couples! \n7. New York State Fair Defibrillator For a heart-stopping costume, dress up as the NYS Fair's most talked-about fried delicacy this summer. Wear a grilled cheese hat and decorate yourself with angus beef burgers, deep-fried pickles, deep-fried cheese curds and deep-fried bacon. Drizzle yourself with hot cheddar cheese and charge people $10 to take a picture with you. \n8. Le Moyne/SU freshman Go Dolphins! Go Orange! Wear a lanyard! Let's go to Chuck's! Let's go to Mully's! Let's cry in a corner because we'll still be paying off student loans in 2035! \n9. Brewerton disco mogul Dave Buono just wants to go where everybody knows his name. Wear a red suit or crushed velvet smoking jacket, carry a working disco ball and boogie down. Elizabeth Fay and one of her \"Dutch\" rabbits at the New York State Fair. Photo by Dick Blume. Katrina Tulloch | ktulloch@syracuse.com \n10. 2015 NYS Fair poultry contestant Damn that avian flu outbreak. Dress as a rabbit. \nWant to be an LSU fan in Syracuse? Better make plans to drink this town dry. Clean out every bar you go to and wear plenty of purple and gold. Geaux Tigers! \n12. Doctor Slappy Everyone heard about Dr. Michael T. Clarke , the Syracuse doctor who slapped his anesthetized patients before surgery. For this costume, all you need are scrubs and the determination to slap your friends all night long, especially if they're passed out. Hey, when you're this rich, anything goes. \n13. Syracuse water main Here's a good costume for anyone at least 80-years-old or older , since that's about as long as our Syracuse pipes have been around. Douse yourself in water, dangle some rats off your arms and bring water guns to squirt your friends. Every other hour, announce you need a break , then pee everywhere. \nWho else would make a great Halloween costume in Syracuse? Alexander and Catalano? Billy Fuccillo? Jim Boeheim in 1977? Leave your ideas in the comments. \nSpecial thanks to the Syracuse Improv Collective for starring in our video. \nKatrina Tulloch writes features and entertainment stories for Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.
