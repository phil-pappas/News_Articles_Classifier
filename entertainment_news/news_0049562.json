Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ​ Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell teamed up with her best friend Michaela Blaney to write a book about three 21-year-old BFFs — Sophia, Demi, and Leandra — who are navigating early adulthood, each with very different life goals in mind. This is the prologue to the book; in it, the characters are 17 years old, and just getting ready to leave high school.\nLet's get lost.\nThat was their goal for the night. Demi had just gotten her licens e , and they decided to d rive around V ancouver in her da d 's Mercedes w ithout a plan. Windows do w n, w ind in their hai r , music blasting: freedom. T his was what it was all about. Getting lost in their o w n world in their own cit y . Y ou can't really know a city until y ou ' re hopelessly lost in it.\nMore From Cosmopolitan T he a lmost-s um mer ni g ht was clear a nd f ull of s t ars, a nd just wa r m enou g h to keep the w indows open. T hey a ll smoked the n — it was the coolest thing to do, right? — and laughed at how they must have looked, c r uising do w n the road, a big car w ith three a r ms straight out the w indows.\nT hey headed do w nto w n. T hey were too young to get into any of the cool bars and clubs, but were d ra w n to them an y wa y . T he three friends gawked at the college kids and the beautiful people lined up outside. Seventeen was a frustrating age. They were so close to real life, but not quite there yet.\nDemi headed south, over the Lions Gate Bridge, through Stanley Park, and made a detour into English Ba y , where local hipsters and tourists sat on logs on the beach to smoke weed or cigarettes. T he g irls sat on the rocks, listened to the waves, and smoked w ithout wor r ying about the smell. In the distance, they could make out yacht li g hts and the sound of the newest dance track — Bob Sincla r 's \" W orld, Hold On\" — bouncing across the water.\n\" P arty cruises,\" said Demi. \" H ouse music. H ot guys. T ons of booze. Three hours of fun.\" Demi was the most petite of the three of them — she bristled when Sophia or Lean d ra called her cut e — w ith bright hazel eyes, a tiny dot of a nose, petal pink lips, and soft chestnut hair that she usually wore in a pon y . She might look sweet and innocent, but then she opened her mouth.\n\"We should go on one ! \" said Lean d ra, the self-ac k nowledged sexiest of the trio, w ith lusciously shaped long limbs; high, hard melon boobs; bounc y , aggressively blond waves (they all agreed she went too light this tim e ); and upturned green cat eyes that made strong men weak and smart boys stupid.\n\"Can we bring Jesse ? \" asked Sophia, gorgeous and exotic, mixed race ( Irish and Philippin o ) , tall, w ith nearly black thick hai r , a killer smile, botto m less dark eyes, olive s k in, a nd bo r n-that-way g race. W h en s h e w al k ed, or s a t, or just stood t h e r e , peop l e sta r ed a t h er. Jesse was her boyfriend. E ven on the rare night they weren't together, he was always on her mind. Demi and Lean d ra, who were currently sin g le, spent so much time together they were like a couple themselves.\n\"If only we could just hop on one of those yachts and get out of here,\" said Demi. T hey were all ready for high school to end, and real life to begin.\n\" And go where ? \" asked Leandra. \" What place on Earth could po s s i bly be more exciting that V ancouver ? \"\nT he girls all howled w ith laughter at that one.\n\" Wherever we go, we'll go together,\" said Demi, throwing an arm around Lean d ra.\n\" Travel is deﬁnitely on my list. And Jesse's,\" said Sophia. \" But you guys know what my number one priority is . \" The others nodded. Sophia had wanted to be an actor since forever. Her parents were on the fence about her d ream. T hey were in business, and thought acting was a major gamble. \" But being successful and traveling go togethe r ,\" she said. \" When I ' m a Bond girl, for instance, I ' ll have to shoot in T okyo, Milan, and Dubai . \"\n\" Exactl y ,\" said Demi. \"I'll meet you in whatever city and be your 'normal person' friend. Eve r y celeb needs one . \"\n\"I ' ll retire in T uscan y . But during my Oscar and Emmy years, we ' ll maintain a Holl y wood base so I can d rive my white Range Rover to lunch at Il P astasio in Beverly Hills . \" Sophia followed a lot of travel bloggers on Instagram. She knew the hot spots in LA. \" Y ou guys can come, I g uess. But only if you don ' t give me shit about my taking a thousand pictures. It's not a choice. It's a need . \"\n\"It's your addictio n , \" said Demi.\n\"It is,\" said Sophia, whipping out her phone and snapping awa y . \"Okay! Enough ! \"\n\"One more ! \"\nT hey started laughing hystericall y , and fell onto the sand. Sophia stood over Demi a nd L e a n d ra, shooting away. \" Stop ! \" Demi was laughing so hard, she di d n ' t making a sound.\n\"I ' m going to miss this when I move to New Y ork,\" said Lean d ra. \"Or W ashington, D .C. I ' m torn. Do I want a W all Street husband and live in a penthouse on P ark Avenue, or should I mar r y a senator, and live in a town house on Dupont Circle? Decisions, decisions . \" \" That ' s your dream? Marrying a douche bag who ' ll dump you for a younger model in ten years, lea v ing you to raise the brats by yoursel f ? \" asked Demi, grinning.\n\" A r i c h an d p o w e rf u l douche bag. And don ' t wor r y . I ' ll get a good settlement in the divorce . \"\n\"Goes without saying . \"\n\" W hat about you, Demi? \" asked Sophia. \" W ha t ' s the ﬁve-year plan ? \"\n\" Are we doing a college inte r view no w ? \"\n\"Quit stalling . \"\n\"I definitely want to be successful, not sure how. While I figure out what I want to do, I ' ll just hang out in Lean d ra's to w n house, mooching off her rich husband . \"\n\" W e'll find you space, like in a closet somewhere . \"\n\"I can mooch off Sophia and Jesse, too, or be the hired caretaker of their villa in T uscan y . \"\nLean d ra smiled. \"Glad we've got it all figured out . \"\nT he girls laughed on cue, but this whole conversation was ma k ing them a bit anxious. Longing for their lives to begin di d n ' t mean they weren ' t scared shitless about it.\n\" W e can have whatever we want, you realize,\" reminded Sophia. \"All we have to do is stay positive and never give up . \"\nDemi barked a laugh. \"R ight . \"\n\" N o, it ' s true,\" said Leandra. \"Don ' t you read all those Quote: boxes on Insta ? \"\n\" Y ou mean, 'Breathe it all in,' \" she said sarcasticall y , and then took a deep inh a le of her cigarette. \" ' A nd love it a ll ou t' ? \" T he smoke streamed out.\nSophia said, \"More like, ' follow your bliss and the universe w ill open doors for you where there were only walls.' \"\n\" Who said that?\" as k ed Demi. \" The woman who wrote T h e B u lls h i t ? I mean, T h e S ec r e t ?\"\n\" What's the alternative? Blow off bliss, live a boring life, get old and bitter, living alone w ith eight cats ? \"\n\" So the choice is ' follow your bliss , ' or ' die alone, w ith cat d rool on your chin , ' \" said Demi.\n\" Yes,\" said Sophia. \" So why not go for it ? \"\nW h y no t ?\nT hey decided \" Why not ? \" would be their mantra for life. \" Let's ma k e a pact,\" said Leandra. \" W e promise to k eep each other on track, follow our bliss, and love, honor, and cherish our friendship, from this day fo r ward . \"\n\"Is this a pact, or a vow ? \" asked Sophia. \" Both . \"\n\" To bliss,\" said Demi. \" And making out w ith men, getting d runk, and having the time of our lives . \"\n​Bliss ​is on sale October 6.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail St. Martin's Press", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250075688", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1225/gallery-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x731/gallery-1443808333-bliss-rev11-1441726394.jpeg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x1600/gallery-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x800/gallery-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443808333-bliss-rev11-1441726394.jpeg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x2000/gallery-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x960/gallery-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x600/gallery-1443808882-gettyimages-453730482.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:41:46.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
