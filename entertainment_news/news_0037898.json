It has been almost 10 years since the release of the double platinum, Café Bossa. But her distinct voice and a full roster of bossa-fied hits have made Sitti a prominent name in the music industry. And this year, she’ll revive the well-loved album, recorded al fresco with Singles Bossa Nova Trio. \nThe final product came as a surprise after being just a fun, last hurrah to singlehood project for Sitti. Talks with MCA Music produced a one-day, live recording session at a house in Rizal with guitarist Erskine Basilio and percussionist Diego Martinez. No pressure, just good old jamming, and this time with Mother Nature. “What makes this record special is that the birds from the area sang with me as well,” Sitti remembers. They went out of the studio to create an experience close to the jam sessions with friends or family music lovers have at home. And the results were better that Sitti has hoped for. “It was quite magical.” Sitti with Erskine Basilio and Diego Martinez \nSome of the most well-known Sitti singles had a fresh twist on this album like “Girl From Ipanema,”“Tattooed On My Mind,” and “Para Sa Akin.” Plus, other favorites like “Sunday Morning,”“I Want It That Way,”“To Forget You,” and “La La Means I Love You,” just to name a few. What makes this new release more special is that her original songs finally take center stage. \nHer carrier single, “Ligaya”, defines her life right now as a married woman. “There’s just so much joy and gratefulness surrounding that song, that’s why we gave it that title too. Happiness fleets, joy runs deeper,” Of course, the song is also about her husband, Joey Ramirez, and is the most special among the songs she has ever written. Other originals include “Answers” and “All I Ever Wanted.” \nNot a lot of people know that Sitti has always been a songwriter and Singles Bossa Nova Trio hopefully is the start of an all-original release in the future. “I really truly hope the fans would like them. And I continue praying that God will breathe some more songs through me,” Fans can indeed expect more songs because of the special inspiration married life has given her. “I had no idea being married could give one such happiness. I feel very lucky too knowing that I have a wonderful husband to walk through this earth with.” Sitti also just wants to share her joy and music to all the fans who’ve supported her since the beginning. “I love all my fans. I wish I could gather all of them in one area and give them big, fat, bossa kisses! Thank you, thank you, thank you.” \nMCA Music and Sitti want every music fan to join in this exciting journey of revisiting bossa nova in Singles Bossa Nova Trio. Only good things are ahead for the Bossa Nova Queen, especially with her newfound passion and inspiration. It won’t be long before the airwaves will once again be graced with a very familiar voice – a voice that’s undeniably Sitti. \nSingles Bossa Nova Trio is now out on CDs at Astroplus and Astrovision outlets and available for download on Spinnr and iTunes. It can also be streamed on Spinnr, Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer and Guvera.
