The event will begin at 7 p.m. Saturday in the Milton-Freewater Community Building, 109 N.E. Fifth St. Victorian or Civil War-era dress is encouraged, but if you don’t have either of these option in your wardrobe, formal wear or any dressy attire is appropriate. Event organizer Rick Tuttle hopes this location will become the permanent home for the annual event because the building has a great dance floor, the stage for the band is the right size and the venue is the right price. The 12-piece Country Dance Orchestra from La Grande will provide the music and Dan Clark will call the dances. “No need to be concerned if you don’t have a partner or lack experience — these dances are designed to be mixers so you never dance with the same person for very long,” Tuttle said. Steps will be taught before each dance begins. “In fact if this was a proper Victorian ball a husband and wife could not be partners,” Tuttle said. Walk-in tickets are available for $25 per person, but you can get them early for $20 per adult or $15 per student at the museum website, kirkmanhouse.org.
