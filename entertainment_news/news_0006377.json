Both have been charged with aggravated robbery which is a first degree felony, reports the station.\nPolice say a green two-door sedan - with Bass-Hudspeth inside - first entered the drive thru at the fast food restaurant and placed an order around 12:55 a.m. Surveillance video reportedly shows that an employee opened the window and Hughes allegedly jumped through.\nAccording to the police report, Hughes then struck an employee in the head with a gun and demanded money from a register. He then allegedly escaped through the window and drove off with Bass-Hudspeth, police say.\nShortly after the robbery, officers located the getaway car driving nearby, according to CBS DFW. Police then conducted a traffic stop and arrested both suspects.\nOfficials say cash -- allegedly from the robbery -- was found on Hughes. He later allegedly confessed in both men's roles during the crime.", "external_links": ["http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/10/09/video-shows-brazen-robbery-through-restaurant-drive-up-window/", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/anvload.html?key=eyJtIjoiY2JzIiwicCI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJ2IjoiMzMwNDg1NCIsInBsdWdpbnMiOnsiaGVhcnRiZWF0Ijp7ImFjY291bnQiOiJjYnNsb2NhbC1nbG9iYWwtdW5pZmllZCxjYnNsb2NhbC1zdGF0aW9uLWRmdy1kZnctdSxjYnNsb2NhbC1zdWJwcmltYXJ5LXN3dHYtdW5pZmllZCxjYnNsb2NhbC1tYXJrZXQtZGFsbGFzZm9ydHdvcnRoLXVuaWZpZWQiLCJwdWJsaXNoZXJJZCI6ImNic2xvY2FsIiwiam9iSWQiOiJzY192YSIsIm1hcmtldGluZ0Nsb3VkSWQiOiI4MjNCQTAzMzU1Njc0OTdGN0YwMDAxMDFAQWRvYmVPcmciLCJ0cmFja2luZ1NlcnZlciI6ImhlYXJ0YmVhdHMub210cmRjLm5ldCIsImN1c3RvbVRyYWNraW5nU2VydmVy"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:17:11.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
