The evening marked what is likely one of the most exhilarating performances in the arts this year with six dances, three of them by David Parsons and spanning more than 30 years of his career. \nThe company Parsons founded in 1987, after dancing with Paul Taylor ’s company, has earned a reputation for its immense stamina on stage, which came through vividly throughout the evening from the nine dancers. \nTheir origins — Canada (via Ireland), Spain, Italy, Puerto Rico, California, Florida, Texas, Utah and Ohio (Middletown in the greater Cincinnati area, to be exact) — helps mark Parsons as a truly international company. However, its expansive and exuberant style ties it to the great American tradition of artists like Taylor and Martha Graham . Parsons has described his “Finding Center,” the opening piece that had its premiere this year, as a work about childbearing. However, the piece reveled more about the connection between men and women in relationships and how their differences, in part, are manifested by childbirth. \nTo music by Thomas Newman also used for the soundtrack of the film “American Beauty,” three couples wind their way through the piece mostly in playful romps with interspersed moments of tension and others of tenderness. The near effortless appearance of the partnering that bore no trace of submission masked rigorous work. In some of the most touching moments, Ian Spring held Elena D'Amario parallel to the floor and within just inches of it and rocked her. Here, the women weren’t alone, but supported. Ailey, Parsons, new works from Louisville Ballet \nBut Parsons Dance has a history of including work by other artists, and Louisville’s audience saw three such pieces. \nAmong them was the new work “Almah” by Katarzyna Skarpetowska with music specifically commissioned for the dance by Ljova . To Ljova’s Eastern European and sometimes Middle Eastern melodies and arrangements, “Almah” presented a group of dancers from which a couple emerged after a woman touched the floor and rubbed her fingers like she was sifting through soil. \nThe man who noticed her joins her into several tender duets. These are interspersed between the dancing with the rest of the group in movement characterized by arching and swirling arms. A theme involving the elusiveness of finding intimacy within a larger group or culture clearly emerges. \nWorks by other choreographers in the program have been part of the company’s repertoire for several years. This included “Hymn” (2007) by Trey McIntyre , a duet for two men. Set to music by CocoRosie , it matched Parsons’ choreography with its dynamic spirit. Many small jumps accentuated the movement that flowed swiftly as the two often encircled each other in different ways. (McIntyre’s now defunct company performed in Louisville in 2012.) The Courier-Journal Arts and Leisure Section \nIn stark contract, “Train” (2008) by former Parsons’ dancer Robert Battle who is now artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater , held a heavier scenario with five dancers taking on hard-edge personas with moves including stomping and agitated jumps to music by Les Tambours du Bronx . Dressed in black and their midsections, with rippling muscles and accentuated by light, their characters resembled sports figures or industrial workers bonded in world that strengthened their physicality but cut them off from joy. \nHowever, the choreography gave these tough figures moments of self-expression when their bodies seemed to be howling in pain and grief. \nOf course, Parsons’ presented “Caught,” the choreographer’s hallmark work created with lighting designer and company cofounder Howell Binkley in 1982. This work truly creates a suspension of disbelief. Its hypnotizing and magical effect comes by way of the choreography and strobe light set to music by Robert Fripp that works to reveal dancer Ian Spring frequently in midair. Spring not only appears to be flying, but it all looks effortless, even though audience members are smart enough to understand the mechanics of the technology and the exertion on the dancer. Parsons Dance promises 'a roller coaster ride' \nThe evening ended on a warm note inspired by Brazil in Parsons’ “Nascimento” (1990) to music by that country’s singer-songwriter Milton Nascimento . The colorful costumes and backdrops imbued this piece with strong rushes of romance as dancers took high jumps and skips across the stage to encounter each other and mingle. \nIt all looked like a playground until two dancers found each other. Here, like previous pieces, “Nascimento” included tender partnering. But this was interrupted by doubt and distractions as the man and woman look to others in the group. Later, harmony between the couple returned to end the evening on an exuberant note matching the style that Parsons Dance has become known for delivering. \nReach reporter Elizabeth Kramer at (502) 582-4682 and ekramer@courier-journal.com.
