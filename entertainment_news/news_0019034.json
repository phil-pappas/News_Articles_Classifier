Factions of the group in 2014 pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. Even before the film’s release, Hollywood director Michael Bay’s new action movie is stirring controversy among government officials and residents of Benghazi, Libya’s second-largest city and the birthplace of the uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The film, “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” depicts the events of the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. It is set to be released in January 2016.(AP Photo/Mohammad Hannon, File) \n© 2015 Cox Media Group .
