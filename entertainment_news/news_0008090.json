She joined now co-anchors Colin Jost and Micheal Che to talk one of the week's biggest stories: Playboy's announcement that it will no longer run nude photos.\n\"It means that my dream of posing for Playboy will never come true,\" she said. \"It's something I've dreamed of since I was a little girl. I dreamed of doing all the poses.\"\nDon't worry, though -- Fey got the opportunity to perform some of those poses she had dreamed of for the audience.\nEarlier in the episode, Fey also made an appearance during Morgan's opening monologue, joining fellow \"30 Rock\" alums Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer for a spoof of the NBC sitcom.\nSee Fey's \"Weekend Update\" below, which begins at the 3:55 mark.", "external_links": ["http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=zlsydeaenbbam96y7h0faw"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:13:13.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
