There are several children’s dance schools locally, but when they age to college, it’s difficult to get them to come back to the dance group. In 2013 The Shannonside Ceili Dancers were named the Citizens of the year at the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade.\nWith their Irish eyes a smiling, the Cooper sisters who also have three brothers and are Chili natives always wanted to learn Irish dancing. Now they are back to their hometown to do just that. Jeanne Stevens, Marianne Tucker, and Patti Zimmer. (Photo: JOHN SPAULDING)\nNow, this is not your Riverdance type of dancing. It is more a form of Irish square dancing, and they use mostly traditional music to perform to, although occasionally there is some contemporary music and dancing mixed in. They practice every Monday evening at the 1st Baptist church in Chili at 7p.m., and are always looking for new dancers. They will teach you everything you need to know. They used to move their practices around, but 10 years ago they found this church and love the space.\nThey are the oldest dance group in Rochester, and their 35th Anniversary party will be the largest social event this year. See the poster below for the date and time, featuring the band Catch and Release. They have danced all over New York including in New York City. So stop in to the celebration this Saturday evening and get a glimpse of Irish culture and heritage, and meet some new people. It will be held at the Eagles club, 1200 Buffalo Road from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.. Admission at the door is $12.\nShannonside Ceili Dancers 35th Anniversary Announcment\nShannonside (named after the river in Ireland) Facebook Page .\nVisit their website HERE", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/shannonsideceilidancers?fref=ts", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/Rochester/Rochester/635802942495109618-Cooper-Sisters.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a04b1be70562ab737743a728a2c41de6077bb2b1/c=0-190-3640-2246&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Rochester/Rochester/635802942495109618-Cooper-Sisters.jpg", "http://shannonside.webs.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:02:58.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
