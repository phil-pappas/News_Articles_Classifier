The Block's Luke and Ebony in their winning living room. Channel 9 Cars For Sale \nLUKE and Ebony have finally tasted success on The Block. \nThe Busselton siblings came from behind to clinch their first win by just half a point over a re-energised Andrew and Whitney. \nBuilding dramas and questionable layout decisions from the other teams cleared the way for the brother and sister to break Kingi and Caro's winning streak. \nThe judges praise Luke and Ebony for finally nailing down the style they've been struggling to express so far in their renovations. \n\"I think Luke and Ebony have created for the first time today, a room you can live in,\" Neale Whitaker said. Luke and Ebony's winning living room in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \n\"I'm looking at things like shelves and the number of chairs, it's feeling more like a living room to me.\" \nThe pair was also praised for knocking down several walls to create a more open flow between their living room and the spaces that will soon become their dining and kitchen areas. \nAndrew and Whitney received a huge boost to their confidence thanks to their second-place finish. \n\"What I love is that in a week when they've shut down the site - in a week that's been really stressful - they've still had real timber floors laid,\" Darren Palmer said. Whitney and Andrew's living room in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \n\"It shows planning and foresight and courage, all the things we want to see, in a tight timeframe with no budget.\" \nWhile the judges applauded the thought behind the custom painting in their living room, they said it would have been suited to a young, hip apartment in St Kilda. \nDespite toning down their home theatre theme for their living room, Kingi and Caro were still harshly marked by the judges. \n\"I feel like I'm in a home theatre waiting for the movie to start. I don't feel like I'm in a living room,\" Whitaker said. Kingi and Caro's living room in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \n\"There's a lot to like stylisticallyâ€¦ but it doesn't feel welcoming.\" \nThe judges recommended they change the layout of their large leather couch to take in the city views through the expansive windows. \nGold Coast mums Suzi and Vonni once again copped a ribbing for venturing into tacky territory with their living room which featured a large bar and full-sized wine fridge. \n\"This is the drinking den,\" Whitaker said. \n\"It's now in danger of just feeling tacky.\" Suzi and Vonni's living room in a scene from The Block. Channel 9 \nShaynna Blaze also labelled their electric faux heater the \"most hideous\" thing she had seen this series. \nDespite the judges recommending they turn the wine fridge and bar into a wall of shelves, Suzi and Vonni vowed to leave the room exactly as it is for auction day. \nNewcastle couple Dean and Shay were never in the race. \nThe penthouse renovators knew their living room wouldn't be finished in time for reveal day because of delays with the works of show's team of tradies who work parallel to the contestants. \nThe judges had little to critique and remained skeptical of the couple's choice to move the location of their living room for the benefit of the kitchen.

Channel 9 \n\"This is one of the cases of change the layout at your peril,\" Neale said. \n\"Even if this room was completed with those (waist-high) windows like that you'd walk in and go 'oh'. It's all about impact (of the city views) and the impact is lost in here.\" \nEarlier this week host Scott Cam topped up the bank accounts of each team by $50,000 to help them last the distance of the show's 10 weeks. \nAnd because of budget issues, a purchase approval process has been imposed on two of the teams: Suzi and Vonni and Whitney and Andrew. \nThis upcoming week the teams will build their kitchens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:42:42.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
