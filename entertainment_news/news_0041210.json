Because I often travel with my precious pooches (Penelope and Henri), I truly appreciate hotels and resorts that provide accommodations and special perks for my furry babies.\nInn by the Sea is one such locale, where dogs are treated like royalty. From LL Bean dog blankets to homemade treats, they pull out all of the stops for Fido and friends.\nThe best part? You can dine with your doggies. Yep, the bar/lounge area is pet-friendly and you can order from the Sea Glass restaurant menu.\nFurther north, at The Essex , four-legged guests are always warmly welcomed. So much so that they have an entire weekend dedicated to doggies. November 13-15, the resort invites guests to Top Dog Weekend.\nThe weekend kicks off with a happy hour featuring doggy treats for canines and drink specials for humans and is followed by a dog food cooking class at the property's Cook Academy.\nThat afternoon, guests and their pets can visit nearby Mills Riverside Park and Indian Brook Reservoir for self-guided hikes. Finally, dogs are treated to a Pet-A-Cure on Sunday morning to keep nails trim and coats shiny.\nThe package also comes with a two-course dinner for two and one pet from the in-room dining menu. Dogs can feast on menu items like Vermont turkey meatloaf with fresh apples and salmon cakes with tomato rice.\nPackages start at $499 visit www.essexresortspa.com or call 800-727-4295 to learn more.\nThere will be loads to instagram after your weekend festivities. Who knows, maybe you're pooch will become as famous as Tuna Melts my Heart or Toast Meets World or get featured on The Dogist instagram account.\nThe cooler-than-cool photo-documentary series insta account just released The Dogist: Photographic Encounters with 1000 Dogs (Artisan Books; October 20;Hardcover/$24.95 )--available today on Amazon!", "external_links": ["https://www.innbythesea.com/?gclid=CMG_oarT0cgCFUkYHwodEY4Hww", "https://www.innbythesea.com/portland-me-amenities/waterfront-dining/", "http://thedogist.com/", "http://www.toastmeetsworld.com/", "http://www.essexresortspa.com/", "http://www.tunameltsmyheart.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579656714"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:52:25.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
