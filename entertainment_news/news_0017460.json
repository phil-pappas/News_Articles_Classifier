The analysis from RealtyTrac showed that 14.3 percent of Rochester homes in the foreclosure process were considered \"zombie\" homes during the third quarter of 2015 because they had yet to be repossessed by the bank.\nRochester, which the report said had about 3,200 vacant homes , outpaced Trenton, NJ, among major metropolitan areas, as well as New York City and Albany — which had 7.9 percent of homes deemed as \"zombie\" properties.\nThe findings showed that overall, between July and September, the number of zombie properties in the nation fell 27 percent from the previous quarter and down 43 percent from a year ago. The drop coincided with a similar decline in homes that are even in foreclosure, the real-estate company said.\n“What is surprising is there are so many vacant homes where the homeowners do not appear to be in financial distress — with only 3 percent in foreclosure or bank owned, and only 6 percent that are underwater,\" Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, said in a statement.\nStates with the most vacant “zombie” foreclosures were New Jersey with 3,997 homes; Florida with 3,512, and New York with 3,365 homes.\nFinding a solution to zombie properties in New York has been a focus for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. He has sought a law that would force banks to assume responsibility for the homes as soon as they are abandoned, rather than when the foreclosure is complete.\nThe measure has yet to pass the state Legislature.\n“New York will never be able to fully recover from the devastation of the financial crisis until we seriously reckon with the crisis of zombies,” Schneiderman said in a statement April 17.\njspector@gannett.com\nOn Twitter: @GannettAlbany", "external_links": ["http://www.realtytrac.com/news/foreclosure-trends/realtytrac-q3-2015-u-s-zombie-foreclosure-and-vacant-property-report/", "http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-introduction-expanded-legislation-combat-spread-%E2%80%9Czombie", "https://public.tableau.com/profile/darenjblomquist#%21/vizhome/TheVacantDead/Dashboard1"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:40:20.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
