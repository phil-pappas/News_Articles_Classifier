Like Dugard, Joy Newsome was a child herself when she was snatched off the street by an abusive lunatic and imprisoned in a living hell where rape and intimidation were constant companions. And like Dugard, the nightly molestations eventually produce a child. In this case, a boy named Jack. But unlike Dugard, Jack and Joy are a work of pure fiction culled from Emma Donoghue’s acclaimed novel in which the concept of incarceration takes on all shapes and forms, whether it’s in a shed or a media-crazed world in which one clan’s tragedy serves as titillating entertainment for hundreds of millions of Nielsen families. Yet the book, and in turn Donoghue’s script, speak clearly and succinctly to fundamental truths about our will and our need to survive, even in the face of unspeakably evil circumstance. But what’s the long-term cost of those short-term skills? That’s what interests Abrahamson. And it’s what captivates us. Like his wonderfully wickedly weird debut, “Frank,” Abrahamson pries his way into the minds of his characters to explore the many facets of what it is to be human: our ability to adapt; our refusal to never cede hope; and most of all, the ability to be resourceful and deductive under pressure. There are no cheap Hollywood thrills, no manipulations, no special effects. Just nail-biting suspense. And that probing question: What would we do if this were us? Me, I only wish I could be as brave and determined as Joy, a woman who has every reason to feel sorry for herself, yet devotes every waking minute to making sure Jack is happy – or as happy as a little boy with hip-length hair can be in an environment in which he has no friends beyond his imagined pup, Lucky, and no toys other than the “snakes” Joy makes out of cracked egg shells. When we first meet them, it’s the morning of Jack’s 5th birthday. Everything seems normal, even their environment, which cinematographer Danny Cohen captures in such tight closeup that it looks like our heroes could be in any cramped, rundown apartment. But as Cohen gradually pulls the camera back, we begin to notice the absence of windows, the forbidding steel door and the pulse-raising claustrophobia of two people trapped in an 8-by-8 space they not-so-affectionately call Room. At times, the tone of the film seems off. It’s a little too upbeat and whimsical. Then you realize that what we’re seeing is through the inquisitive eyes of Jack, who’s never known anything beyond what he’s seen in Room. Even the nightly rapes of his mother, which take place with him safely tucked away inside their wardrobe, don’t seem to faze him. But, now that he’s 5, his maturity level has reached a place where Joy knows she can no longer explain everything away with another Alice in Wonderland fairytale. It’s time for Jack to go. And Joy is going to unleash every borderline cruel trick to get Jack out of Room and away from the crazed jerk mother and son know only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). What ensues is as thrilling as it is frightening. It also sets the stage for a sharp gear change that takes “Room” into a completely unexpected direction in which Jack and Joy face even greater challenges. What that shift is, I will not say, and you should not be aware of it before you see “Room.” So you’d be wise to steer clear of other reviews that might give it away. What I can tell you, is that “Room” benefits immensely from two Oscar-worthy performances. As was the case with Mark Rylance in last week’s “Bridge of Spies,” you’ve probably never heard of Brie Larson or Jacob Tremblay, but you most certainly will when nominations are announced in January. As Joy and Jack, Larson and Tremblay devastate you with their heartbreaking realism. As does Joan Allen in a critical role I won’t disclose. I can’t recall a movie that had not one, not two, but three mind-blowing performances at its core. Nor can I recall a movie in which a child actor was as natural and believable as Tremblay. He makes acting look effortless, and his range is incredible, from depicting wonder to impish brattiness to intense sadness. He even handles the narration duties with aplomb. Yet it’s the thing he has no control over – his chemistry with Larson – that allows “Room” to touch audiences deeply enough to garner top prize at last month’s prestigious Toronto Film Festival. Never for a moment do you doubt they’re mother and son, cementing a palpable bond that cuts straight to the heart. And ultimately, that’s what makes “Room” so powerful and life-affirming. The discovery that there’s no love greater than that between a mother and son is hardly insightful, but to see it depicted so movingly on screen, it seems revolutionary. Like Old Nick, “Room” captures you and won’t let go. Movie review ROOM (R for language.) Cast includes Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen and Sean Bridgers. At Kendall Square, Cambridge.
