Bang ShowBiz Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nYOKO Ono admits she is \"super careful\" since John Lennon's assassination in 1980 and still fears she will encounter her husband's murderer Mark Chapman, despite the criminal serving a life jail term. \nThe 82-year-old artist was married to the Beatles star until his murder in 1980, and admits she now struggles to go anywhere without remembering the day crazed fan Mark Chapman - who is currently serving a jail term - shot her husband. \nShe shared to the Daily Beast: \"I'm super careful, almost like a certain animal who is used to being hunted, like a deer. So when I go out or when I don't go out, in my apartment, I'm very, very careful. \n\"It's very, very difficult for me to think about Chapman, especially because he doesn't seem to think that was a bad thing to do. It's crazy.\" \nMeanwhile, Yoko previously insisted there is no bad blood between herself and Sir Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr, despite having been blamed for the band's split in the past. \nShe said: \"I know that it was very difficult for them, too, but they're not talking about it. For instance, that classic style of 'Let's keep our chins up' was typical of John. \n\"John and I went through so much difficulty and when that was happening we said: 'OK let's just ignore it'. \n\"I don't think the other Beatles had to go through that much, really - John was the one who was taking it all. But I know that they're doing their best. I really love them like my brothers.\" john lennon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:13:49.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
