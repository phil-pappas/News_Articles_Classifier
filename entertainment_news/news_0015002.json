The zipper of her see-through leotard opened in the middle of her \"3\" performance, but the show had to go on. The pop singer gestured her backup dancer to help her zip it back up while she continued doing the dance routine. Several of her male dancers tried to fix the zipper while she pranced around the stage, but it remained open until the song ended. As soon as the light dimmed, she was seen running backstage for costume change. Britney Spears began her Las Vegas residency show in late 2013. She originally signed a 2-year deal before expanding it later into another two year. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:50:29.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
