It could barely walk or stand,” she said.\n“He then phoned the dog owner and explained humane euthanasia would be best, and the owner gave consent. But when our staff member re-entered the property, three men had joined the son who questioned our collector’s authority and decision.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:39:25.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
