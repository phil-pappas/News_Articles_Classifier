The so-called “8 House,” a sly urban mountain village of an apartment complex, was designed by Bjarke Ingels as an ode to democratic, egalitarian community, with a kindergarten on one floor and a fascinating collision of tight confines and open vistas. Co-directors Ila Beka and Louise Lemoine make wonderful use of their 85 minutes, turning “The Infinite Happiness” into a cinematic apartment crawl, blessedly free of the customary documentary trappings. In Danish with English subtitles. \n2:15 p.m. Saturday (repeats 3 p.m. Monday), AMC River East 21, 322 E. Illinois St. Tickets $11-$14 at chicagofilmfestival.com . Running time: 1:25. \n-Michael Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:22:57.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
