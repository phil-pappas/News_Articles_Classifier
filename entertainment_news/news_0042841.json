The public is invited to a 5 to 7 p.m. reception Saturday, Oct. 17, which will include a gallery talk at 5:30 p.m. \nShorette is a social activist, environmentalist, pursuer of dreams and artist. After earning an Associate of Art Degree from the Maine Photographic Workshop/University of Maine at Augusta; and a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Photography from the Maine College of Art, Shorette began her 13-year career as a staff photographer with The Waldo Independent and The Republican Journal. During that time, she won numerous Maine Press Association awards for her coverage of life in Waldo County. \nIn August 2013, Shorette took a leave of absence from her employment at County Copy & Print Center in Belfast, turning her camera, creativity and dreaming to the icy waters of the northern regions of Labrador and Newfoundland with their sparsely populated coastlines and islands while traveling aboard the 90-foot vessel Wanderbird . \nShorette’s images draw from her personal connection, respect for nature and being in the moment with a quiet mind. She continues to share her journey on the Wanderbird through presentations that include images from “A Reflection Of A Journey: ‘Sedna’s Reach,’” writings and song. Shorette lives off-grid on her 45-acre hilltop homestead in the rolling hills of rural Jackson. \nThe Marsh River Co-op Store is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. For more information, call 722-3053. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
