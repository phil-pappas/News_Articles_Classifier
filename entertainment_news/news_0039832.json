Movies are available on streaming sites such as iTunes, Amazon and Vudu unless otherwise noted.\nBuy it now\n“Southpaw”: Jake Gyllenhaal , buffed up and cut after looking whittled away and wasted in “Nightcrawler,” proves once again he’s willing to go the distance in this boxing drama. Here he’s a light-heavyweight champ who must fall hard so he can rise again.\nAlso: “Vacation”\nRent it now\n“Testament of Youth”: Swedish actress Alicia Vikander , who gave a breakout performance in the chilly sci-fi film “Ex Machina,” shows her range in this World War I drama based on Vera Brittain ’s memoir. Vikander stars as Brittain, a young woman from England’s upper class whose personal losses and experience as a nurse during the war helped lead her to embrace pacifism.\nAlso: “Jurassic World,” “Paper Towns”\nStill in theaters\n“Beasts of No Nation”: Netflix started streaming this drama the same day it opened in theaters, which appears to have hurt its box office numbers. (Go figure.) The flipside is that Idris Elba ’s powerful performance as an African warlord can be seen by curious film fans even if it’s not playing in their neighborhood.\nTelevision\n“Olympus”: It’s not that the reviews were basically bad for this “Clash of the Titans” mishmash from Nick Willing , the man behind other Syfy spectacles such as “Tin Man” and “Alice.” It was barely reviewed at all. With so much great TV on the air and online, there’s not much time left for the merely weird. “Olympus” is at least worth a mention, though, as part of Matt “Max Headroom” Frewer’s recent resurgence.
