So far, he's failed. More than two dozen Cosby accusers to get prime-time attention \nThen later Friday, NBC News is presenting a special Dateline show that brings together 27 of the more than 50 women who have accused him in the last year of drugging and sexually assaulting them decades ago in alleged encounters dating back to the mid-1960s. \n27 Cosby accusers assembled for NBC News 'Dateline' special on Oct. 9. (Photo: NBC News) \nAlthough the women are expected to repeat stories they have already made public in different forums in recent months, the visuals — more than two dozen women seated together in theater-like rows in a network studio — won't be good for Cosby's already battered image. \nBut very little happening of late has been good for Cosby. He has denied all wrongdoing and he has not been charged with a crime, but that's about the only thing he has going for him in the current environment. Let's answer the big questions left hanging: \n1. How many civil lawsuits are pending against Cosby? \nFour that we know of. Five if you count one that's been revived from 2005. \nA group of three accusers is suing him for defamation in Massachusetts, where he lives. Ex-model Janice Dickinson, represented by lawyer Lisa Bloom (Allred's daughter), is suing him for defamation in Los Angeles. \nAspiring model Chloe Goins, represented by Florida lawyer Spencer Kuvin, filed a new suit against him in Los Angeles on Tuesday alleging sexual assault. (Goins also hopes the Los Angeles district attorney will one day file criminal charges against Cosby over their alleged 2008 encounter, the most recent of the accusations against Cosby.) \nCosby accuser Chloe Goins, in January 2015.

That suit was settled in 2006 and supposedly sealed, but when damaging excerpts of the deposition in that case leaked earlier this year, Cosby's legal team went back to court to fight over the leak and a possible reopening of the case. That's still pending. \n2. When will the public get to read Cosby's Friday deposition in the Judy Huth lawsuit? \nMaybe never, if Cosby gets his way, but definitely not until Christmas. After the leaked deposition in the Constand case, he would not want public airing of his answers to sensitive questions about what he did or didn't do in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. \nBill Cosby in November 2014. (Photo: Phelan M. Ebenhack, AP) \nWhat's that case about again? Huth's lawsuit alleges sexual battery when she was 15. Despite multiple attempts by the Cosby legal team, led by celebrity lawyer Marty Singer, to get it thrown out and to stop the deposition, that case is moving forward. Cosby is scheduled to be deposed by Allred and Huth on Friday. \nOne thing's for certain: If this deposition is ever made public, it won't be until around Christmas. Why? Cosby won one concession from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan on Wednesday: Testimony in the deposition will be sealed at least until Dec. 22, when there will be a hearing on whether to continue the seal (as Cosby wants) or allow the deposition to be made public (as Allred wants). Assuming, of course, it doesn't leak before that. \n3. How many women have publicly come forward to accuse Cosby? \nThat depends on who is counting. By some counts, the total number, including some who have declined to give their full name, is short of 50; by other counts, the total has passed 50. As recently as Oct. 2, new accusers were coming forward. Three new Bill Cosby accusers come forward \nTheir stories are all different in detail — who they were, how they met Cosby, what they say happened, where it happened — but are similar in pattern, involving alleged drugging into unconsciousness followed by sexual assault. Another thing they have in common is that most of the alleged encounters took place so long ago that criminal charges are unlikely. \n4. What effect will repeated retelling of their stories on TV have? \nSo far, nothing legally significant, although the pressure on Cosby has cranked up every time there's a mass airing of Cosby accusers. The NBC Dateline interview is only the latest. \nA&E cable network interviewed 12 accusers last month. New York magazine got 35 of them to tell their stories and pose for a dramatic cover in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:53:34.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
