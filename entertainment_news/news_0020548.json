So is she finally ready to get back in the game? On Monday's episode, the girls use a dating app to try to find a new man for Amy, and in a future episode, Stephen Merchant and Analeigh Tipton are guest-starring as potential dates for Amy and Sheldon. But don't think any of it is love at first sight. \"I don't think either of them would want to jump into anything too quickly, even if one is concerned about what the other is or isn't doing,\" executive producer Steve Molaro tells us. \"That's not in their nature, definitely not Sheldon's. We're going to play it by ear and see what, if any, steady new relationships develop, but just getting out there going on a date or two is fun and good for them and has the potential for a lot of new stories. This [breakup] is about growing them as individuals.\" Do you want Sheldon and Amy to date other people? The Big Bang Theory airs Mondays at 8/7c on CBS. Crave scoop on your favorite TV shows?
