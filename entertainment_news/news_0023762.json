The results were shocking. Source: Channel 7 \nMembers of the provocative group celebrated the publicity opportunity, claiming the later numbers had been “fiddled with” and thanked the network for a boost in followers. \n“The early results were the honest and true ones. It became clear it was going to be an onslaught in our favour,” one commenter wrote on Facebook. \n“Don’t worry! It’s a win. Great media exposure, page numbers are up!” \nReporter Alex Cullen who was embedded with Reclaim Australia leaders during a recent rally described the influence of the group’s Facebook page, which now boasts more than 48,000 likes since Seven’s story aired, as “downright scary”. \nAnticipating criticism for giving the controversial group airtime, Cullen had already prepared a justification for airing the story. Reclaim Australia founders Wanda Marsh, John Oliver and Catherine Brennan sat down for a grilling/publicity opportunity with Sunday Night.

I have to then ask, why not?,” he wrote. \n“These are real people with a serious story to tell as are those who are standing up to oppose them. Their actions concern a lot of people, from the Prime Minister down. So, do they warrant our attention? Their motivations, views and aspirations should be questioned and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” \nMany viewers took to social media criticising the program for promoting “bigoted” views, while others claimed to have been converted after viewing. \n“Until this Sunday Night story I didn’t know much about Reclaim Australia. I assumed that it was a bunch of racist Muslim hater extremists,” viewer Sarah Cannon wrote. \n“How wrong was I? Your goals resonate with my personal views of equality for ALL Australians. I think most Aussies would agree with you wholeheartedly.” Reclaim Australia supporters are as happy with the program as Wanda is painting her anti-Halal signs.
