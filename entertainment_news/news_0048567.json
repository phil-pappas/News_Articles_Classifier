Not only is a reunited Soundgarden writing for their next project, but earlier this year the singer lent his vocals to the Zac Brown Band’s No. 1 rock radio single “Heavy Is The Head.” \nHowever, it’s his “Songbook Tour” that keeps him grounded and inspired. \nThe one-man show finds Cornell playing career-spanning hits and album cuts, as well as unique covers such as Mad Season’s “River of Deceit” and Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.” \nThe Vindicator talked to Cornell – who returns to Northeast Ohio for a Thursday show at Lakewood Civic Auditorium – about the impetus behind his “Songbook Tour,” the lasting impact of Temple of the Dog and why he’s not ready for a gold watch. \nQ. First of all, congratulations on your new single “Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart.” A far as “Higher Truth” was concerned, how did you approach the album? \nA. The main thing is I wanted to make would be sort of largely an acoustic album, where songs were written as acoustic songs. The reason for that is since I started the “Songbook Tours,” which have been around the world now, it’s just been such an amazing experience to kind of connect with 30 years of songs I’ve written with an audience. It becomes such an intimate setting, and it’s sort of simple: I don’t follow set lists and can kind of do anything. I wanted to continue to do it, and I think in order to be able to continue to do it, I needed to make it a living thing to make new songs written specifically for that. \nQ. Your upcoming Northeast Ohio show marks your third time playing the Lakewood Civic Auditorium. What is it about that venue that keeps you coming back? \nA. When I started doing the “Songbook Tours,” where it’s just solo acoustic shows, I didn’t know what it was going to be. The only way I was going to get any experience was to schedule a full tour. It was within the first week I figured out the most important thing is that it has to be the right room — a theater. It can’t be a standing venue, a House of Blues. I can’t see a Miller Lite neon behind somebody’s head. None of that works for me, the atmosphere has to be right. \nQ. This year marks the 25th anniversary of writing and recording the “Temple of the Dog” album with what would become members of Pearl Jam. Any idea why that record has stood the test of time? \nA. We got lucky. Any answer other than I don’t know is kind of [expletive] when it comes to that. All of us as musicians have made a lot of other albums that stand the test of time and I don’t know what that is other than maybe it has what is your motivation for writing songs. \nQ. Finally, here’s the obligatory Soundgarden in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame question. The band has been eligible for a while. Do you see it happening anytime soon? \nA. It’s not something that I’m in a hurry for. It might just be my personal perspective, but I’ve seen a lot of bands get inducted that are defunct or there are several dead members or something like that. To me, it feels like something that should be more of like in the category of a gold watch. And I’m not ready for a gold watch, yet.
