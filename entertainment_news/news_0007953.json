Brooklyn activist Isaac Abraham called Joe Lhota’s mayoral campaign over the summer with a request: Could Lhota visit Williamsburg's Hasidic Jewish community?\nTwo months passed without an answer, Abraham said - until an hour before Lhota swooped into the neighborhood.\n\"The communication and outreach are a disaster,\" Abraham said.\nIn a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 6 to 1, Lhota always faced an uphill battle to become mayor. But the first-time candidate has made the challenge far greater by running a poorly conceived, managed and executed campaign, GOP operatives and elected officials say.\n\"It's been a painful campaign to watch,\" veteran Republican strategist Ed Rollins told the Daily News.\nLast Wednesday, a walking tour by Lhota of Borough Park, Brooklyn, turned into a public relations headache when he entered an ultra-Orthodox synagogue and the women accompanying him - an aide, a reporter and an NYPD detective - were asked to leave.\nOn Thursday, Team Lhota was on the defensive again when it was revealed that an image in his new TV ad was used without the photographer's permission.\nThat same day, Lhota abruptly backed out of a speech to a Municipal Art Society gathering at Lincoln Center. The campaign said his schedule was too packed - even though Lhota had accepted the invite far enough in advance to appear on the printed programs.\n\"You just can't do that. You have to show up,\" Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway said.\nBut the problems are bigger than the avoidable day-to-day stumbles, Republicans say.\nDecisions involving fundamental campaign building blocks - from messaging to scheduling - have left Republicans baffled and frustrated.\nAfter winning the GOP primary, Lhota waited — some say wasted - 17 days before making his first big policy pitch, a 33-point plan to power up the economy. It offered a clear contrast to Democrat Bill de Blasio's platform.\nYet, it was released on a Friday without advance notice, and Lhota was not available to talk about it until a tour of Queens that afternoon - hardly a recipe to maximize coverage.\nAnd Lhota has barely talked about the plan since, although his campaign has spent days, to little effect, focused on de Blasio's sympathies for Nicaragua's Sandinistas in the 1980s.\nSimilarly, Team Lhota did not release his book of policy proposals until Oct. 10. That, too, was emailed to reporters without notice.\nSome days, Lhota himself is barely visible. On Saturday, 17 days before the election, he had no events on his public schedule until a 6 p.m. fundraiser in Chinatown, all but eliminating the opportunity for “free” media coverage.\n\"I'm in equal parts embarrassed and disappointed that they've run such a lackluster campaign,\" said Republican political consultant Gerry O'Brien. “They haven't marketed him anywhere near the way they need to.\"\nSimmons, Howard/New York Daily News Joe Lhota is facing an uphill battle Some Republicans believe the problems begin at the top.\nLhota Campaign Manager Vincent Balascio and Political Director Kevin Tschirhart have never steered a city campaign, and the search for a prominent name to head a Democrats for Lhota drive has been fruitless.\n\"You need someone with experience to manage the race, you need people in the room who have run campaigns throughout the city and you need to have people with different political backgrounds — and I don't think this campaign has any of that,\" a Republican familiar with the Lhota campaign told The News.\nWhat is especially surprising to many Republicans is that Lhota has been a skillful manager in a public career that has included stints as city budget director, and, most recently, as chairman of the MTA, where his acclaimed work getting the mass transit system running after Hurricane Sandy created momentum for his mayoral candidacy.\nCampaign spokeswoman Jessica Proud brushed aside the criticism, saying Lhota has \"continuously spoken about his vast experience over Bill de Blasio and about being on the right side of the issues that New Yorkers support.\n\"We have run ads talking about those issues. We're in the press every day talking about those issues. I would love for someone to point to any campaign in our country's history that has been flawless,\" she said. Accusing de Blasio of executing a Rose Garden strategy, she added, \"It's really easy, when you're in hiding, to never make a mistake.\"\nSome Republicans are willing to cut Lhota slack.\n\"Look, when you hear what the polls are saying, it's very easy to say his campaign is not running well,\" said Robert Scamardella, former chairman of the Staten Island Republican Party. \"It could be that he's running a very good campaign, but the demographics are such that it's just an insurmountable uphill battle.”\nHe added, \"I think Joe Lhota is doing the best that he can. Politics involves a lot of things. Timing is one of them.\"\nStill, with the most recent polls showing Lhota more than 40 points down, many Republicans are despirited.\n\"When the errors are being highlighted as opposed to the vision ... I think to a certain extent, that's a campaign that's got big trouble,” said Rollins.\n\"What I've heard from so many people is,'I'm going to vote for Joe. I'm not going to give him any money. I don't think he can win,'\" Rollins said. \"There's no enthusiasm building up among Republicans or others that there's an alternative to de Blasio. I think that's the death knell.\"\nStephen Thompson, past president of the Richmond County Young Republicans, said he's concerned Lhota has not only failed to make inroads with Democrats, but isn't even giving the rank and file a rallying flag to carry into the battle.\n\"It's certainly hard to sell (Lhota) to the average voter that's not involved (in politics) all the time,\" he said cautiously.\n\"I guess the worst part is, I don't really know what his message is.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:17:07.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
