Currently hosting Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded, he is all geared up for his upcoming films like Tere Bin Laden 2 and Katha. The small screen funster talks about his journey and his upcoming films. \nIt has been two years since you made your film debut with Mickey Virus. What is keeping you away from the big screen? \nWe all wait for good things to happen. Of course there has been a gap since my last film. As an actor that was not in my control, and all I had to do was wait. While waiting, I hosted. Now, Tere Bin Laden 2 is ready for release by early next year. And I have also finished Katha, a remake of the 1983 classic. Katha, too is expected to be released next year. I am also doing a film called Baa Baa Black Sheep which is a comic thriller. \nAre you apprehensive about comparisons with Ali Zafar who played the lead in the first part? \nThere is no question of comparison because they are two different roles. Many people think I have replaced him but that is not true. He is doing a cameo in the film and a big thank you for that. \nYou recently completed 10 years in the entertainment industry. Do you feel you have achieved what you set out to accomplish? \nIt is an amazing feeling. When I came to Mumbai 10 years back, I had no idea I would come this far. It feels good but I donâ€™t think I have achieved everything. There is a long way to go. I have too many wishes to fulfil. All I can do is hope that it goes well. We all are hungry artistes, we always want more work. I want to do many more films and entertain the audiences. \nBetween hosting and acting, what do you prefer? \nBoth! I cannot choose one and that is the reason I do both. Had I preferred acting over hosting, I would have been at home after Mickey Virus (2013). I will do films as well as television or even advertisements. I am here to work. Acting needs preparation. Hosting can be done with a few goof ups but a movie captures everything, including a hair strand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:56:53.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
