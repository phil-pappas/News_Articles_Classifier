The petition generated only a few hundred signatures without an official White House response. But it garnered enough attention for a March 2014 front page story in The Wall Street Journal, which, if nothing else, put the hot dog on the plate of Unicode, the digital world's emoji gatekeepers.\nMeanwhile, chatter on Twitter and Facebook gathered steam, with hot dog fans and rival chains across the country expressing support for the Superdawg-led #HotDogEmoji campaign. Still, progress was slow.\nYou can finally download hot dog, taco, burrito emojis Lindsey Compton It's official: I can finally send a hot dog emoji to my friends when I'm craving a Chicago dog .\nThe new iOS 9.1 update, available today, includes emojis depicting a hot dog, a taco, a burrito, a cheese wedge, a bag of popcorn and even a bottle of bubbly being popped.\nHere's your guide to best usage...\nIt's official: I can finally send a hot dog emoji to my friends when I'm craving a Chicago dog .\nThe new iOS 9.1 update, available today, includes emojis depicting a hot dog, a taco, a burrito, a cheese wedge, a bag of popcorn and even a bottle of bubbly being popped.\nHere's your guide to best usage...\n(Lindsey Compton) \"There were some times that I lost faith ... but we never stopped talking about it,\" Ustick said.\nThe breakthrough came in June when Unicode, a California-based international nonprofit that standardizes character coding, gave the green light to the hot dog and 40 other emoji characters. The new emojis also include a taco, burrito and popcorn, along with images of a robot face, lion face and a human face with head bandage.\nThe chosen emoji is simple — a hot dog with mustard in a bun. While it's far removed from the fully dressed hot dog, Ustick said it was close enough.\n\"We were hoping for a Chicago-style hot dog, but we understand emojis are universal and this makes it more acceptable for everyone,\" Ustick said.\nReached by email Friday, Mark Davis, president and co-founder of Unicode and a software engineer at Google, wasn't quite ready to give Superdawg credit for the new hot dog emoji.\n\"While it's always difficult to be certain, I think the inclusion of hot dog emoji was independent of that campaign, that it would have happened anyway,\" Davis said.\nEmoji campaigner John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune “We knew what (the hot dog emoji) was going to look like, but the first time I saw it in the flesh, it was beautiful,” said Laura Ustick, a third-generation member of family-owned Superdawg, and general manager of their north suburban Wheeling outpost.\n“We knew what (the hot dog emoji) was going to look like, but the first time I saw it in the flesh, it was beautiful,” said Laura Ustick, a third-generation member of family-owned Superdawg, and general manager of their north suburban Wheeling outpost.\n(John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) The original Superdawg drive-in was opened in 1948 by Ustick's grandparents, Maurie and Flaurie Berman. It remains at Milwaukee, Devon and Nagle avenues on Chicago's Northwest Side, watched over by two 12-foot-tall hot dogs on its roof.\nThe family opened a second location in 2010 on Milwaukee Avenue in north suburban Wheeling, putting Ustick at the helm.\nMaurie Berman died in May at age 89, but his widow, children and grandchildren have kept the family business going, with social media now an integral part of the marketing strategy, Ustick said.\nTheir first tweet after the new emoji went live this week spoke volumes about their hard-fought victory.\n\"Our immediate tweet from Superdawg was 140 characters of the hot dog emoji,\" Ustick said.\nSuperdawg's one non-negotiable aspect made the emoji victory extra satisfying for Ustick, and Chicago hot dog purists everywhere.\n\"It has mustard and not ketchup, so we are happy,\" she said.\nrchannick@tribpub.com\nTwitter @RobertChannick\n Twitter, Inc.
