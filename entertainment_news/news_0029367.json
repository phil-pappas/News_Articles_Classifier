Bachelorette Australia returns in 2016 Sam Frost has found love again with Sasha Mielczarek in a emotional final episode of The Bachelorette .\nMany suitors swept Sam off her feet, including suave runner-up Michael Turnbull, but the special connection she shared with Sasha was undeniable.\nSam Frost and Sasha Mielczarek in The Bachelorette Australia 2015 finale. \nFrom passionate kisses to touching conversations, we recap the top moments where we knew the Sydney construction manager was always going to win.\nAdvertisement Their first meeting \nOf the 14 men on the first night of The Bachelorette , it was definitely Sasha who made the best impression.\nFrom the moment they locked eyes on each other, Sam was rendered tongue-tied around the dreamy tradie, becoming nervous and flustered whenever in his presence.\nLater over wine in the mansion's manicured gardens, Sam admitted Sasha made her \"turn into a little girl\".\n\"When I first met you I was such a nervous wreck, I don't know what came over me. I just started fumbling over my words, but when it comes to first impressions it was you,\" Sam said, giving him the first rose the competition.\nAll of the other guys should have just gone home then.\nThat steamy first kiss \nNot only did Sasha score the first rose of the competition, but he also snagged the first kiss.\nOn their first solo date, Sam was flustered once again as she and the brawny Sydneysider did the tango and got a chance to put their hands all over each other.\nIt wasn't until the cocktail party that Sasha took the plunge and planted Sam with a steamy and lingering pash.\n\"It was exactly how it was supposed to feel,\" Sam said, while Sasha admitted to being \"lost for words\".\nSimmering chemistry? Check.\nFamily ties and painting for charity \nFamily is the most important thing in Sam's life and she frequently spoke of her love for her late stepfather who died several years ago from a stroke.\nSasha and Sam immediately bonded over both being children of divorce and being raised by their influential stepfathers.\nIt was while painting a mural for the Stroke Foundation that Sasha mentioned his grandfather had also been killed by a stroke.\nThe love between Sasha and Sam was clear as he held her while she cried as she recalled staying by her stepfather's in hospital.\nLater on that date, the pair revealed they were falling for each other.\n\"I love being around you,\" Sam said. \"I think your personality is infectious and I just want more every time I'm around you.\"\nRescuing Sam after fainting \nSasha went into ultimate boyfriend mode when Sam became dizzy and faint after their skydiving date on Thursday's semi-final.\nAs a doctor checked the stunning brunette's vital signs, a concerned-looking Sasha held Sam, giving her water and comforting her, and later admitted he had been \"freaking out\".\nSam, who was already clearly head over heels for the 30-year-old, said the experience brought them closer together.\n\"Seeing that side of Sash made me realise that he is the type of guy that would absolutely support you through thick and thin.\"\nGame over.\nWhen Sasha dropped the L bomb \nWhen Michael mustered up the courage to tell Sam he loved her she gave him a polite thanks. \nWhen Sasha dropped the L bomb? You could almost feel the earth move.\nSitting on New Zealand hillside, Sasha finally let his guard down and said it would be \"devastating\" if he were left without her.\n\"I do love you. I've known for quite a while.\"\nSam lost it and almost cried her mascara off, later saying she felt 'happy all the way to her soul'. \n\"I'm sitting here with an incredible man who could be the one,\" she said.\nAnd he was.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:22:24.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
