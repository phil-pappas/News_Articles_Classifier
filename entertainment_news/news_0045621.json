Kingdom Academy is part of more than 1,500 private schools throughout Florida that participate in the Step Up for Students Scholarship Program.\nSince 2011, Infinity Auto Insurance has contributed $9.5 million in the name of Read Conmigo, the company’s bilingual literacy program, that has in turn funded 1,841 scholarships to Florida’s underprivileged schoolchildren.\nStep Up For Students helps administer the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program, which enables companies, like Infinity Auto Insurance, to redirect a portion of their Florida tax liabilities to fund scholarships.\nDuring the 2015-16 school year, more than 77,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade are attending either an out-of-district public school or private school of their choice with help from a Step Up scholarship. Step Up For Students has provided more than 475,000 scholarships to Florida students since the program’s inception in 2001.\nCaptions:\nPicture 1: The scholarship recipients show Read Conmigo representatives around their classroom.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12975572.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12975572.htm"], "published": "2015-10-01T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:21:38.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
