(Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Report an error \nLOS ANGELES - More \"Transformers\" -- much more, in fact -- is on the way. \nHasbro chief Steven J. Davis confirmed in a Q&A that a \"Transformers\" 5, 6, 7 and 8 are in the works at a Q&A at Mipcom. \n\"We just finished, as some of you may have read, just an incredible experience,\" he said. \"We decided that we wanted to plot out the next 10 years of the Transformers franchise, so we got together in a room over a three-month period of time.\" \n\"Nine of some of the most creative writers I have ever worked with, shepherded by Akiva Goldsman, who many of you may know won an Academy Award for A Beautiful Mind and written a bunch of great movies,\" he went on. \"And they plotted out the next 10 years of Transformers. Similarly, we are doing the same in television and in digital. So stay tuned, Transformers 5 is on its way, and 6 and 7 and 8.\" \nParamount, the studio behind the action movies, previously confirmed that the \"Transformers\" universe was expanding with sequels and spinoffs, with Goldsman spearheading the writers room. However, the only confirmed sequel was \"Transformers 5,\" which Goldsman is writing. \nOthers in the \"Transformers\" universe writers room include \"Black Hawk Down\" scribe Ken Nolan, Christina Hodson and Lindsey Beer, Andrew Barrer & Gabriel Ferrari, \"Walking Dead\" creator Robert Kirkman, \"Iron Man\" scribes Art Marcum & Matt Holloway, Zak Penn, \"Amazing Spider-Man 2's\" Jeff Pinkner, \"Daredevil\" showrunner Steven DeKnight and Geneva Robertson-Dworet. \n\"Transformers 5\" has not chosen a director yet, and Michael Bay tweeted last month that he has not signed on to helm the sequel, saying that he has \"not committed to any idea as of yet.\" Re: directing TF5. No, it's not official. I have not committed to any idea as of yet. Just met with Steven and we are discussing. â€” Michael Bay (@michaelbay) September 17, 2015 \nBay directed \"Transformers: Age of Extinction,\" the fourth in the series and the first one without Shia Labeouf. It starred Mark Wahlberg, Jack Reynor and Nicola Peltz and, despite losing Labeouf, grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.
