(Photo: KHOU) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOne of the nation’s most iconic magazines is undergoing a big makeover: Playboy says it will stop showing nude women in its magazine. \nStarting in March 2016, the print magazine will still feature women in suggestive poses but they will no longer be fully nude. Playboy officials say they made the decision because it’s just too tough to compete with all of the similar free content available on the Internet. \nThe magazine’s circulation has dropped from millions of readers in the 1970s to around 800,000 currently. Now editors say they’re trying to attract new Millennial readers between the ages of 18 to mid-30s with in-depth interviews, investigative journalism, and visual art. \nHugh Hefner, the magazine’s 89-year-old founder, who is currently listed as editor-in-chief, gave his blessing to the idea, according to the New York Times.
