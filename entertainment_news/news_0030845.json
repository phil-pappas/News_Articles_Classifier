Picture: GCIS Related articles Tuition fees deal a ‘co-ordinated farce’, say student leaders UWC students say campaign for free education ‘just beginning’ No university fee increases for 2016, Zuma announces In this article People: Jacob Zuma PARLIAMENT’s portfolio committee on higher education and training has lauded the announcement by President Jacob Zuma that there would be no fee increments at universities in 2016.\nCommittee chairperson Yvonne Phosa on Sunday commended the government‚ university leadership and student representatives for reaching an amicable agreement, which is expected to restore order after normal tertiary institutions operations were disrupted for almost two weeks.\n\"The government has displayed responsiveness by finding a way of dealing with a matter of national importance with escalating protests whereby students were calling for fees to fall,\" said Ms Phosa.\n\"We welcome the short-term solution as announced by President Zuma and also acknowledge that for the medium- and long-term‚ work is continuing in order for a sustainable solution to be found‚\" she said.\nThe committee regarded the agreement as an essential building block towards the implementation of a policy on fee-free higher education for poor and academically deserving students in the long term.\nMs Phosa said it was always important to recognise that the provision of fee-free education at tertiary level was a process and not an event that would be accomplished overnight.\nHowever‚ she hastened to state that this process had to be accelerated.\n\"It will be in the best interest of this country if this process is fast-tracked‚\" she said.\nAfter what had largely been peaceful protests over nine days‚ the committee was concerned that \"some rogue elements within the student population attempted to smuggle violence into the campaign\" at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Friday.\n\"We condemn such acts of violence with the contempt they deserve. The perpetrators who have been identified and those who can still be identified have to face the consequences of their unruly actions.\n\"We cannot have a situation whereby a peaceful and legitimate protest gets marred by the actions of a lawless few‚\" said Ms Phosa.\nSimilarly‚ Ms Phosa condemned the isolated cases where excessive police force was reportedly used against students at protests that took place elsewhere during the \"Fees Must Fall\" campaign.\nRDM News Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:06:24.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
