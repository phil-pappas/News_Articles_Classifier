And it is to King's original story rather than the iconic 1994 big-screen version of it that Owen O'Neill and Dave Johns' stage adaptation looks.\nHere, Dufresne's incarceration for allegedly killing his wife and her lover in 1940s America is told through the eyes of Ellis 'Red' Redding, the prison go-to man, who can supply pretty much anything any self-respecting jailbird would need. For Dufresne, this includes a rock hammer and a pin-up poster of Hayworth for reasons which are eventually made clear.\nShare article Inbetween navigating his way through the institutionalised brutality of the penal system on both sides of the law, Dufresne manages to negotiate a library into being. This becomes a symbol of his quietly unwavering determination to stay true to himself over the next two decades in the face of the iniquities of the prison caste system. Salvation trickles down too through hoarded copies of banned novels, while Dufresne guides George Evans' serial delinquent Tommy Williams through his exams.\nWith its roots in O'Neill and Johns' own production, seen in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013, David Esbjornson's touring production of this rewritten version scales things up on Gary McCann's expansive prison set. Ian Kelsey makes for a powerfully stoic Dufresne and Patrick Robinson an equally charismatic Red, while O'Neill drips hypocritical venom as Warden Stammas. All of which makes for a powerful treatise on integrity and honesty for a full-blown meditation on the pains of confinement and the power of hope beyond.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-06T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:29:08.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
