The Democratic front-runner played a sympathetic barkeep named \"Val\" opposite Kate McKinnon's celebrated impression of Clinton in Saturday Night Live's season premiere on NBC. In the sketch, McKinnon's Clinton is blowing off some steam after a \"hard couple of 22 years\" and \"Val\" is on hand to counsel her. Clinton and McKinnon poked fun at how long it took the former secretary of state to reach policy positions on the Keystone XL Pipeline and gay marriage. \"Nothing wrong with taking your time. What's important is getting it right,\" Clinton said. Clinton also did her best Donald Trump impression, which she's known to do on the trail from time to time. \"Donald Trump? Isn't he the one that's like 'Ugh, you're all losers,'\" she said in a deep voice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:23:46.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
