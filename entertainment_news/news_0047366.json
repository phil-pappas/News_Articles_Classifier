Join me this Friday (Oct. 9) morning at 11, right here, and let's talk about ....\nLately, seems like every day there is another shooting in New Orleans. It's getting to the point where you dread going out the door or live in fear of some criminal dropping in uninvited. It's a crime -- and I've got the experts here to talk about it.\nFirst up, former NOPD chief and Loyola professor, Ronal Serpas attempts to shed some light on the darkness. With an impressive resume, including terms as chief of the Washington State Police and Nashville police department, Serpas says he was brought in as a \"game changer,\" a fact that did not make him popular among the troops.\nHe makes the case that that under his tenure, the image of the NOPD grew among citizens. Serpas' emails to the mayor show that he was warning against high attrition rates early on.\n[Watch episodes of \"The Spudcast\" on YouTube .]\nZombies preying upon the citizens of New Orleans? That's what it looks like from where Bryan Lagarde sits. He's the guy behind the \"working\" crime cameras at Project NOLA, the nonprofit currently at loggerheads with the city over his providing \"uncredited\" real time surveillance video to police.\nThe Project NOLA system is linked back to a central control that can be accessed by the police immediately, if necessary. There is another system in town but it needs several days searching before the police can retrieve the images. That's valuable time lost in any investigation.\nThe Walking Dead's Ann Mahoney joins MO to chat about her red carpet walk at Madison Square Gardens. (Selfie by Mo Brennan McConnell) Finally, we're ending on a real upbeat! Mo takes off her producer hat and steps in front of the camera to interview our dear friend, actress, Ann Mahoney who is a star of the hit television show, \"The Walking Dead.\"\nIt's all giggly, girl-talk about acting, Ann's custom dress (made from recycled parachutes), and Mo's \"Ten Dumbest Red Carpet Questions\" to get Ann ready for the red carpet media zoo. Lots of fun for two girlfriends.\n***\nWatch The Spudcast, then join the chat! You can Chat Live with Spud on Friday mornings at 11 a.m . at NOLA.com/spud . It's easy!
