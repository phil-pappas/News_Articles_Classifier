In the subsequent 24 hours, it was watched online more than 112 million times. \nThe film's director, JJ Abrams, says the trailer made an impact on fans both old and new. \nSpeaking to the Associated Press at the GLSEN Respect Awards in Beverly Hills Friday night, Abrams commented, \"We were all thrilled that the trailer was seen and embraced and especially people who were saying that they aren't really even fans of Star Wars but they are interested in seeing this thing now is a testament to all the amazing work that this cast and crew have done and the studio in rolling out the movie the way they have.\" \nMany fans noted the absence of Luke Skywalker in the trailer, but Abrams mysteriously cautioned, \"It's no accident.\" \nAbrams said he is almost done with the editing process for Star Wars: The Force Awakens , which opens December 18. It will be released by Disney, the parent company of ABC News. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
