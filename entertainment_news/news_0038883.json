The two have officially registered as voters at the Quezon City Hall recently.\nIn an ABS-CBN News interview, Daniel related his aim to vote for a presidential candidate that is sincere in his or her effort to uplift the country.\n“Hindi pa naman huli ang lahat para makahanap tayo ng magaling na president. Lahat naman iyan magsisimula kung hindi corrupt ang binoto mo. Kapag hindi corrupt, sunud-sunod na ’yan,” Daniel said.\nHe is still mulling on the candidate that would get his vote.\nKathryn said she will go for someone who will prioritize the needs of the youth.\n“Siguro dahil nire-represent ko rin ’yung mga kabataan, we want someone na bibigyan ng chance and papahalagahan ’yung mga kabataan, someone na gusto talaga ’yung trabaho. Dapat dedicated… dapat gusto talaga mag-serve,” she said.\nThe actress advised voters to get to know the candidates really well before making a decision.\n“Dapat makita natin ’yung mga gusto nilang mangyari,” she said.\nKathryn urged Pinoys to go out and register before the Oct. 31 deadline.\n“Huwag nating sayangin ang boto natin, and i-take ’yung chance na ’to para maboto talaga kung sino ang karapat-dapat sa mga positions,” she said.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:26:18.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
