Oliver, who subbed for Jon Stewart as host of \"The Daily Show\" last summer and began his own HBO weekly show in April, often devotes about half of his 30 minutes to a single topic below the headlines. His subsequent report questioning the pageant's scholarship program was the latest example of how Oliver has quickly moved beyond his roots at \"The Daily Show\" to produce something distinctive, and usually hilarious.

But Oliver argues that right after a mass shooting is in fact the worst time to talk about mental health, considering, \"the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent and the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people. ... So the fact that we tend to only discuss mental illness in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading.\" \nBut Oliver was happy to at least have an opportunity discuss the topic on Sunday, considering the fact that we rarely discuss it and \"in 2013 an estimated 43.8 million American adults dealt with a mental illness.\" \nOliver goes on to argue that the way we deal with mental illness is \"a mess and it always has been.\" He says state and federal governments usually fail to prioritize mental health care, instead opting for strategies like \"Greyhound therapy,\" or putting people with mental illnesses on Greyhound buses to other states. He also says that one of the most likely places that people with mental illnesses end up is prison, which is ineffective in treating them, dangerous and expensive for the government. \nThe host argues for a massive overhaul in the entire system so that we can deal with mental illness better as a country. And, he notes, since we're talking about it now, it's probably a good time to come up with a plan. Because, as he says, \"if we're going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, the least we owe them is a (expletive) plan.\" \nYou can watch the full excerpt from Last Week Tonight below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:09:14.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
