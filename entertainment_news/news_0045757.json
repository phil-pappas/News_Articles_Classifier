In this film, the movie fanatics saw the other side of Lara. The audience were eagerly waiting to see the new on-screen pair – Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson but Lara turned out to be a surprise package. We have seen numerous avatar of Lara but her role in ‘Singh Is Bliing’ was phenomenal. She was the real entertainer. \nIn the film, Lara played the role of Emily who is a translator hired by Raftaar Singh (Akshay Kumar). As Raftaar did not know English and Sara (Amy Jackson) did not know Hindi, Lara made her entry in the film as their translator. Well, the beauty didn’t just play like a cartoonist translator but the dialogues scripted for her were superb. To see Lara in a comedy role was a surprise. We have seen her in a sexy avatar but this was a new experience.
