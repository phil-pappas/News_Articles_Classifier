Having spent the last 20 years working in Arts Education it is fantastic to receive this award. It is very much the achievement of the whole team where over the past two and half years we have built up a packed Community and Education programme.

I’m delighted to be working in Newcastle this Christmas on what will be my 9th season with Qdos Entertainment, the world’s largest pantomime producer. \nAs a child I remember coming to see the pantomimes at Mayflower Theatre every Christmas and saying to my family, “When I grow up, I want to work on that stage”. Ten years later, this dream became a reality.” \nMichael Ockwell, Mayflower Theatre Chief Executive added, “This is a fantastic achievement for Rob and Sara following on from our Technical team winning Best Receiving Venue at last year’s awards.

The other nominations for the Best Design category were: \nStewart Laing and Mimi Jordan Sherin for Titus Andronicus, a Dundee Rep production \nLeslie Travers and Tim Lutkin for Rebecca, a Kneehigh Theatre and Theatre Royal Plymouth production \nJulian Bird, Chief Executive of UK Theatre, said: “This year’s nominations recognise the vibrant, diverse and world leading theatre sector that exists here in the UK, across a broad range of venues, creative teams and performances. At this time when theatre is under continued threat due to cuts in funding it is important to demonstrate, to those making decisions about the future of arts funding in every town and city, that we continue to produce outstanding work on stages across the country.” \nSamuel Hodges, Nuffield Director said: Share article \n“It’s brilliant to have won this prestigious award from UK Theatre. It was a real honour to have such talented designers in the building, underpinning our ongoing commitment to bold and innovative design and designers, alongside playing host to this year’s Linbury Prize.” \nNuffield is Southampton’s leading professional theatre company and this year won “Regional Theatre of the Year” at The Stage Awards 2015.
