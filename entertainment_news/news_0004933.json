Photo: The Ashby Bar and Bistro \nRadio 6PR host Karl Langdon had the tough task of rating the pubs over the course of the year before judges from his radio station and WAtoday picked the overall winner.\nAdvertisement \"The judges noted it was a great sports bar with very helpful staff, an excellent selection of daily specials and a fresh and affordable menu,\" Langdon said.\nThe pub only opened its doors five months ago.\nGrab a pint at the bar. Photo: The Ashby Bar and Bistro \nVenue manager Kallen Bond said the demand for the bar and bistro in the 'untapped' area was so strong it almost ran out of food during its opening long weekend.\n\"Mid-week on average we're doing about 250 meals and on the weekend we're picking up more than 400 meals a day,\" Mr Bond said.\nThe most popular items on the pub's menu are the steak sandwich and the feed, frothy and flutter deal for $15 where diners can enjoy a meal, a middy of beer and a $1 mystery bet at the pub's TAB.\nThe Ashby Bar and Bistro restaurant.
