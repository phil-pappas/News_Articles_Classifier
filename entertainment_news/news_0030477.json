However, under the proposed system, the occupant of the property would also be given a chance to put forth evidence on the contrary.\nMinister for the Environment Alan Kelly and Minister for Finance Michael Noonan are discussing these and other proposals as they aim to regulate rent increases in the private market. They are also discussing the idea of upping the notice period for rent increases from 28 days to three months, to allow more time for tenants to either find new accommodation, or come to grips with the new price.\nAll this comes as good news, but it's still a far cry from the idea of rent certainty. Still, we're moving in the right direction at the very least.\nVia Irish Times\nMORE: Rent prices to be tied to inflation for four years to stabilise costs\nMORE: 9 signs you're living with a passive-aggressive housemate\nMORE: Rent prices have soared again, and it's bad news for students", "external_links": ["http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/landlords-may-have-to-give-evidence-to-justify-rent-rises-1.2400744"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:43:06.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
