However, while those projects are \"still under consideration\", we have learnt that the actor could soon be playing a cop in a story penned by writer Vakkantham Vamsi.\nWhile buzz in T-town suggests that Vamsi may direct the film as well, the story writer denied having any such plans saying, \"My first directorial venture will be with NTR. As for the script, I did narrate a story to Venkatesh recently, but I can't say anything more than that at the moment.\"\nThough the writer neither confirms nor denies the development, it looks like Venky is keen on doing the film. \"It is an interesting story which sees the lead character, a cop, in a quirky avatar. The script is still raw and Vamsi has narrated only the outline and Venky seemed to have liked it. If Venky gives a nod, a suitable director will be roped in,\" shares the source.\nGopala Gopala director Kishore Kumar Pardasany (Dolly) is in the reckoning to helm the project.
