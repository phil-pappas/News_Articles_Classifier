And you were glad. \nFor Joy and Jack, though, that's been their life, always. \nJoy was 17 when she was walking home from school and a man lured her inside a van. That was seven years ago. And for those seven years he's kept her – and the child that resulted – locked up in a shed in his back yard. For Jack, that room, and Joy, is all he knows. \nBut now Joy and Jack have a chance at freedom – and all the new dangers that come with that. \nThey're the heroes of \"Room\" and that's a word they truly deserve; although Joy was kidnapped and raped by a monster, although Jack has grown up cut off from the outside, neither of them are victims. For years, Joy has found a way to give Jack a loving life. And now little Jack will find a way to save them both. \nWhat could have been a sordid, exploitive film is really a tribute to a mother's love, and a child's imagination. \nLenny Abrahamson's film begins, as it should, in claustrophobia. We're trapped with Joy and Jack in this shabby shed (whose only bit of high-tech hardware is the lock on the door). We're also allowed to quietly marvel at what Joy's done – made toys out of paper rolls and eggshells, turned daily routines into ways to keep them sane and healthy. \nAnd then we break out of there, with Jack – and like him, stare wide-eyed at the limitless sky and the endless horizon of possibility. \nStill, even out in the big world, this is very much a contained movie, devoid of special effects; even Jack's escape is played straightforwardly, minus exploitive twists or manipulative turns. What it's based on, ultimately, are three performers – Brie Larson as Joy, young Jacob Tremblay as Jack and the terrific Joan Allen as Joy's mother. \nAnd they're all extraordinary. \nLarson has been a fine actress for a number of pictures now, whether it was navigating the dramas of \"Short Term 12\" or the comic realities of \"Trainwreck,\" but she hasn't had a role before that demanded so much of her – fierce protectiveness, hungry loss, naked rage. And she consistently, believably delivers, with art but no artifice. \nJust as real is Tremblay, who never breaks from character (and whose innocent voice of wonder provides the movie's narration). And adding huge emotion is Allen. A bit outshouted in her stage days by the machismo of Steppenwolf, a bit too patrician perhaps for crass Hollywood, she's always been a fine actress and here she's the film's warm heart. \nAbrahamson gives them all the space they need for their performances, mostly going no closer than a two-shot. Yet sometimes his camera also comes close, for the significant detail – the torn sound-proofing on a wall, chipped and dirty nails, the slippery smile of a journalist. \n\"Room\" deflates just a bit in its second half, once Jack and Joy's captivity ends; although their new situation isn't, of course, as naturally as dramatic, it's the filmmakers' job to find the drama in it, and sometimes they let things peter out a bit, failing to explore every irony – as in the new constraints that now come with this sudden freedom, the strange emptiness Joy must feel at no longer being the only person in her son's life. \nBecause as warm and tight and loving as that parent's hand is, eventually every child has to drop it. And every mother has to let them. \nRatings note: The film contains violence, strong language and substance abuse.Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhitty@gmail.com.
