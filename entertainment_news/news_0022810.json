As the Professional Bull Riders get ready for Round 1 of tonight’s five-round series televised around the world from our Thomas & Mack Center, our Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and PBR executives announced the extended pact. \nIt all leads to Sunday’s million-dollar Built Ford Tough World Finals. \n“We are pleased to continue our participation with PBR for three more years and have Las Vegas serve as the host destination for the Built Ford Tough World Finals and Last Cowboy Standings events,” said Cathy Tull, senior vice president of marketing for LVCVA. \n“The partnership with PBR is a natural fit for both brands and we look forward to welcoming back these world class events to the bright lights of Las Vegas.” \nLas Vegas has been the home of the PBR’s season-finale event since the sport’s first season in 1993-94 when Brazil’s Adriano Moraes won the first of three PBR world championships. It is the longest-running event on the PBR schedule. \n“Las Vegas is known for its world-class entertainment, so as a global sport, the PBR feels right at home among its line-up of renowned celebrities and events,” said PBR CEO Sean Gleason. “Las Vegas has been a very hospitable host city that has helped showcase our athletes for more than two decades, and the LVCVA a loyal partner and valuable resource. \n“Its support has helped the PBR grow from a dream of 20 cowboys into the fastest-growing sport in the country. We’re very pleased to continue this partnership and look forward to another two decades together.” \nOn Tuesday, the 40 competing cowboys walked the Hallway of Fame at the Thomas & Mack with frontrunner J.B. Mauney standing with the PBR championship trophy. He has a big lead going into the five-night championship run starting this evening. \nFor the 22nd consecutive year, the world's top bull riders and the fiercest bucking bulls in the business have returned here for the richest bull-riding event on the planet, with its total purse of $2.3 million. \nTonight’s first-round match-ups have been set. \nRound 1 will feature the top bulls of the American Bucking Bull Inc. and also serve as Round 1 of the ABBI Classic Finals, a competition for 3- and 4-year-old bucking bulls. Bruiser (D&H Cattle Co.) currently leads the ABBI Classic standings with more than $60,000 in earnings. He also is one of seven bulls in contention for the 2015 PBR world champion bull title awarded Sunday. \nThe No. 1 bull rider in the world, 2013 PBR world champion J.B. (Mooresville, N.C.), will take on relative newcomer Wicked Stick (Diamond S Bucking Bulls). Joao Ricardo Vieira (Itatinga, Brazil) the No. 2- rider in the PBR world standings, will square off with Pile Driver (Dakota Rodeo/Berger-Struve) unridden in seven outs on the BFTS. \nThe PBR’s leading rookie, Kaique Pacheco (Itatiba, Brazil) sits at No. 3 in the world and will take on D&H Cattle Co.’s Chocolate Shake. Matt Triplett (Columbia Falls, Mont.) is ranked No. 4 in the world standings. He welcomes Cracker Jack (Ricky Carpenter) to his first BFTS event. Cracker Jack has only bucked in PBR Touring Pro Division events to date. \nRed Cloud (Martinez Bucking Bulls) will attempt to dispatch 2014 Rookie of the Year J.W. Harris (May, Texas), the No. 5 man in the world standings, during Round 1. Fabiano Vieira (Perola, Brazil) sits at No. 6 in the standings and will take on Crazy Days (Flying S-Samford) for the bull’s sixth out of his career. \nThe No. 10-ranked rider in the world is 2008 world champion Guilherme Marchi (Leme, Brazil) who will compete this week for the first time since early September after suffering torn ligaments in his knee. He’ll take on Uncle Tink from Jared Allen’s Pro Bull Team. Uncle Tink has been ridden only once in four outs when Robson Aragao (Aracaju Sergipe, Brazil) tallied 83 points. \nThe total purse for the winner of the 2015 PBR World Finals event is $250,000. In the last two years, the World Finals event winner also captured the PBR World Championship, Silvano Alves (2014) and J.B. (2013). According to MGM Resorts International Race and Sports, No. 1 bull rider Mauney is currently the odds-on favorite at 7-2 to take home the $250,000 check for winning the World Finals. \nJ.B. also is 1,315 points ahead of his closest contender, Joao Ricardo Vieira, for the overall PBR world championship, but with 2,200 points available at the World Finals, Joao, Kaique and Matt are still within range of capturing the title. \nFabiano Vieira is the second favorite to win the PBR World Finals with odds of 5-1, while Kaique and Joao’s odds of winning are 6-1. \nThe PBR’s 22nd race for the $1 million PBR World Championship begins at 6 p.m. PT each day through Saturday and at 1 p.m. PT on Sunday. The Ford Blue Carpet arrival of the contestants starts at 4 p.m. daily and 11 a.m. Sunday. \nThe PBR Tyson Fan Zone at South Point welcomes 2008 world champion Guilherme, Kaique, Matt Triplett, Nathan, J.W., Chase Outlaw and Ryan Dirteater for the Interactive PBR Experience. The official after-party for Round 1 is set for LAX at the Luxor tonight. \nPBR Rock Bar & Grill at Planet Hollywood will host two parties. Thursday at 9 p.m. is the Legends Party with 10 PBR riders on hand to sign autographs and meet fans. A red carpet event with opportunities to photograph the riders will begin at 8:50 p.m. The party will include a patio performance from country/pop musicians Morgan Leigh Band. \nOn Sunday, PBR Rock Bar will throw a Retirement Party for famed bull rider and nine-time PBR World Finals qualifier L.J. Jenkins. The celebration will include a custom-built cake. \nIt’s a television exposure bonanza for Las Vegas: CBS Sports Network will broadcast every round of the 2015 PBR Built Ford Tough World Finals live at 5:30 p.m. PT Wednesday through Saturday and at 12:30 p.m. PT on Sunday.
