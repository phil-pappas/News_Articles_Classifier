In an international survey conducted by Railway and Transport Strategic Centre (RTSC), Delhi Metro has been ranked first in \"information during travel\". It has also been ranked second in \"train cleanliness and comfort\".\nThe survey was conducted by RTSC, which manages the 'NOVA' and 'CoMET' benchmarking groups of Metro networks. \"The survey was conducted as per international standards EN 13816 (an European survey system used widely to assess the performance of the public transportation systems in Europe) and was controlled directly by RTSC through an internet link on DMRC's website,\" said an official from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The survey was conducted from April 13 to May 10, 2015.\nIt also conducted the third edition of its in-house \"Customer Satisfaction Survey\" (CSS) from August 24 to September 1, 2015 and covered 96,466 respondents. \"The survey was conducted at the top 50 Metro stations of the network and some responses were also collected from inside the trains,\" the official said.\nCSS included various crucial aspects of Metro operations such as availability and accessibility, new facilities offered to customers, information, quality of service, customer services, outside Metro area, comfort and view on fare revision, security and safety, it added.\nDMRC however, admits that the areas in which commuters expressed the need for improvement were pavements, lighting, cleanliness and orderliness and encroachment outside station premises.\nDMRC will take up these issues with the civic authorities and work towards necessary improvement, the official added.
