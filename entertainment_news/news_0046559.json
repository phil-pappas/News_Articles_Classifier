Now the Webster Together team is inviting the greater Webster community to see what they've come up with so far. Webster Together – the organization pulling together a proposal on how to spend a possible $3 million in prize money -- is hosting a Community Open House on Wednesday October 7 from 5-7:30 pm at the Webster Recreation Center, 1350 Chiyoda Drive. Community members are invited to take the opportunity to share ideas on how to improve Webster, and to preview a draft of investment priorities that have resulted from the public engagement efforts thus far.\nSo if you’ve already submitted some of your ideas to the Webster Together team, here’s your chance to see if they made their way into the draft plan. If you STILL haven’t put in your two cents, this might be one of your last opportunities to do so.\nTo recap…\nWebster is a quarterfinalist in the America’s Best Communities contest, which means our town was selected as one of 50 Best Communities across the nation. The contest is a $10 million initiative to stimulate economic revitalization in small towns and cities. The winning communities will share $6 million in prize money. As a quarterfinalist, Webster must now come up with a complete revitalization plan to be submitted on November 6.\nSo that plan is almost done. If you’d like to see what they’ve come up with, be at the library Wednesday night.\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/WebsterTogether", "http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:17:42.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
