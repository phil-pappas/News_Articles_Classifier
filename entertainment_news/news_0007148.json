As part of the suburban restaurant’s “Cook for Charity” celebrity chef series, yours truly hosted.\nThanks to chef/owner Paul Turano, I learned how to make my very own signature flatbread the “Corsano,” topped with eggplant caponata, goat cheese, arugula and balsamic glaze. The proceeds from each $15 flatbread will be donated to MSPCA Angell.\nFurry friend-loving guests included designer David Josef, PR gal Joanna Humphrey Flynn, retail marketing guru Joan Jolley, my radio partner-in-crime Jonathan Soroff and glam gal about town Jane Conway Caspe.\nIf you weren’t able to join us last night, please consider making a donation online to support the amazing work they do!
