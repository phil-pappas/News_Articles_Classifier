John A. Boehner has pulled out of a scheduled appearance on \"The Tonight Show.\"\nThe Republican speaker of the House, who announced his stunning decision to resign from Congress two weeks ago, had been slated to visit the NBC talk show Thursday night, but will not be appearing, NBC confirmed to the Times.\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour >>\nBoehner was only announced as a guest on Wednesday, an unusually short lead time for \"Tonight.\" The show will not be replacing him with another guest, but will proceed with the planned lineup of Michael Fassbender, Brie Larson and Cee Lo Green.\nAn NBC spokesperson did not provide further details about the cancellation, but it comes amid the surprise news that Rep. Kevin McCarthy had pulled himself out of contention in the race for Boehner's job.\nBut the cancellation puts Boehner further out of step with his fellow politicians, who've been flocking to late night TV. In recent weeks, Fallon and his fellow hosts have welcomed the likes of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen.
