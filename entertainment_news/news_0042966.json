Pittsford’s Raymond Feng started playing piano at five years old; by nine he was winning competitions both on the national and international level. As a soloist, he has performed with the Ashdod Symphony in Perugia, Italy, and also performed at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall. Now, the 13-year-old is preparing to make his debut as soloist with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra at three free community concerts October 8-10, under the baton of Principal Conductor for Education and Community Engagement Michael Butterman . Feng will perform the first movement of Grieg’s Piano Concerto on a program that also includes familiar favorites like Beethoven, Brahms, and John Williams.\n“Raymond is a remarkable young pianist,” said Butterman. “The Grieg concerto is a great one--both flashy and lyrical. It will be exciting to hear Raymond in this work, and I hope that it might just inspire a young person or two to begin their own musical journeys.”\nThe concerts, part of the RPO’s semiannual Around the Town Concert Series, seek to make symphonic music more accessible to all members of the community by presenting free concerts in schools, houses of worship and other community spaces throughout the region. These concerts will take place in a different location each night at 7:30 p.m.: Thursday, October 8 at Rush-Henrietta High School, Friday at Churchville-Chili High School, and Saturday at Webster Schroeder High School.\n“The RPO is very high level,” said Feng, who also plays violin under the tutelage of RPO violinist Nancy Hunt and is concertmaster of the Hochstein Youth Symphony Orchestra. Feng was inspired to send his biography to the RPO with encouragement from Hunt.\n“I’ve played the Grieg concerto before with the Hochstein Youth Symphony Orchestra, and I’m excited to play it again with the RPO. It’s a big movement filled with lush expressiveness.”\nFeng’s parents started him on the piano as a young boy because he liked to play around with an old electric keyboard they had in the house. A pupil of Elier Suárez, Feng says he practices anywhere from 14-16 hours per week while balancing life as a full time student in ninth grade at Pittsford-Sutherland High School. While Feng’s resume seems indicative of a promising career in music, the young pianist hasn’t decided on future plans just yet. In the meantime, he is enjoying performing as much as he can and also performs solo recitals at senior living centers throughout the greater Rochester area.\n“I like math and science a lot, too,” said Feng, who has placed first in various “mathlete” competitions over the last few years. “I know that being a musician is very competitive. I don’t know what I will be when I grow up, but I have a lot of interests to tap into when it’s time to choose a career. For now I just love the opportunity to play and share my music with the community.” If you goWhat: RPO Around the Town Concerts When/Where: Thursday, October 8; Rush-Henrietta High School\nFriday, October 9; Churchville-Chili High School\nSaturday, October 10; Webster-Schroeder High School Time: All concerts at 7:30 PM $$: Free, donations accepted\nFor more information, visit rpo.org/community", "external_links": ["http://www.rpo.org/s_1/s_81/Community_Concerts/", "http://www.rpo.org/s_3/p_1915/Michael_Butterman/", "http://www.rpo.org/s_3/s_31/p_68/Nancy_Hunt_/"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:38:04.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
