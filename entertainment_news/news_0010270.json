I’m kind of new for most people so it’s amazing how people have taken to me in such a warm, kind, loving way. I’m very grateful, thank you very much. \n“It was the dream just to sell enough records to make another one, so to have it straight in at number one is just ridiculous. It’s mental. I’m really over the moon with it and very grateful, obviously, to Ed Sheeran for signing me and putting his faith in my songs and not having any doubt in them at all.” \nThinking Out Loud singer Sheeran has double the reasons to be proud as he celebrates the first success for his record label, because his album x has now clocked up 70 consecutive weeks in the album chart’s Top 10.

The success of this record has happened all by itself – I had no idea what was going to happen when we put it out. Tinie Tempah raps on new number one track; he last reached number one with Jess Glynne in July (Yui Mok/PA) \n“I always wanted a singer and rapper on this track; and it feels like it’s become one of those songs that people are allowed to like – which is just amazing!” \nIt is the first number one for the producer and for Katy B, but it serves as the seventh for rapper Tempah, his most recent being Not Letting Go with Glynne in July.
