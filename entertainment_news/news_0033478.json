The file was placed before the DPP this morning and was not registered. This is procedure in cases where there is no evidence to warrant a trial. There is no case that has been filed against us and we are all fine,” Maurice said. \n\"Our board chairman had also been arrested two weeks back. His arrest had also been instigated with absolutely no basis. There are reasons why the cases were instigated...and they are malicious to say the least,” he added. \nMaurice told MondayBlues that the society will release an official statement on the two issues this week.
