By Dennis Knight\nAt first glance, it seemed like a routine point for the St. Vincent’s volleyball team as Sydney Sanders made the set to Sarah Stewart, who slammed the ball to the floor to open the Saints’ playoff match with visiting Lamar County.\nBut the action on the court was quickly stopped as SVA athletic director Dawn Odom announced that Sanders had reached the 1,000 assist mark for her career. The senior posed for a quick picture with her coaches and was presented with a ball for her trophy case.\nA minute later, it was back to business for Sanders and her teammates as they rolled to a 25-4, 25-8, 25-8 win over Lamar County. The Saints improved to 28-13 with the victory and advanced to the Class AA quarterfinals. The remaining teams will be reseeded tonight, with the Elite Eight round being played Saturday.\nSanders said she wasn’t aware she was about to reach the milestone.\n“I had no idea,” Sander said. “I was confused and thought we had somehow lost the point for a minute.”\nSanders started setting as a sophomore and moved to outside hitter this year until sophomore Dylan Herb was lost for the season due to injury. Sanders runs the offense well, feeding SVA star outside hitter Sarah Stewart, who had eight kills and six digs on the night.\n“It’s nice setting for Sarah because you can always count on her to get the ball over, even if it’s not a perfect set,” said Sanders, who had 21 assists, six aces and three digs on the night.\nStewart said that Sanders has an intelligent approach as a setter.\n“She has a great mental attitude, and she has a lot of confidence in her setting,” Stewart said.\nThe Saints have played a rugged non-region schedule, competing with top Class A teams in the area like Calvary and Savannah Christian. After reaching the Final Four last year, SVA has its sights set on making a run at the title.\nSVA had a balanced attack against Lamar County, and excelled from the service line. Avery Grimm had six aces and six digs, and Mckenzie O’Hayer racked up 13 aces, along with six kills. Grace Friday had five kills.\n“We’ve had some injuries and had to work on some new rotations,” Sanders said. “But we’ve come together and we’re really meshing as a team.”\nStewart echoed Sanders’ thoughts.\n“We’ve been practicing together all summer,” Stewart said. “We’ve got a lot of camaraderie. We want to go all the way and win that ring.”\nSt. Vincent’s def.
