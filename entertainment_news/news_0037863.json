He said he then looked up the news on the Internet to confirm it.\n\"I just sat down for a second and then hid in the bathroom so the cameras couldn't see me,\" he said.\nSkarlatos said he decided quickly to return to Roseburg to be with the community.\nAs far as he knows, none of his friends were among the victims.\n\"My heart really goes out to the people who can't say the same,\" he said.\nSkarlatos and two friends, U.S. Air Force Airman Spencer Stone, 23, and Anthony Sadler, 23, received worldwide acclaim when they tackled the gunman aboard a train while vacationing in Europe. The heroics earned Skarlatos his stint on \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\nThe next installment of the competition airs on Monday. If he misses that show he would be eliminated under the rules.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show Skarlatos' first name is Alek, not Alex.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
