Buzz60 Ask this devoted mother cat about being a responsible parent, and she has quite a \"tail\" to tell about caring for her family. In New Zealand, animal technicians had noticed a cat hanging around the clinic and trying to sneak into their office.\nAccording to the USA Today, the kittens had been dropped off in a cardboard box in front of the Mill Road Veterinary Clinic. The next day a cat was seen trying to enter the clinic, but no one was really paying attention to her \"thought pattern\" thinking she may have just been looking for a treat or some kind scratches behind her ears. When someone finally picked up the persistent pussy cat, she noticed the cat had recently given birth and was still lactating. Knowing that the orphaned kittens were in the office, the staff carefully watched as the amazing mom cat entered the clinic and she immediately rejoined her tiny family. The reports of lots of purring and hugging delighted the entire staff.\nSo this happy family will remain together until the kittens are old enough to find homes. And the next time, you wonder about a mother's love for her children, remember this amazing cat.
