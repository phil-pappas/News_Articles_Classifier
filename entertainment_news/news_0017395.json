The man stumbled upon the remains Tuesday morning in the woods and brought the skull to the grocery store to ask someone to call the police, the Indian River County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\nDeputies located the remains 200 feet off of the road. The bones were \"slightly scattered, in a manner consistent with animal disruption.\"\nAccording to police, the bones were found in an area that is often frequented by a small group of homeless people. Authorities came across several homeless people while investigating the scene.\n\"Those located in the woods were cooperative with investigators and provided information on the possible identity of the deceased subject although detectives have not been able to confirm the name,\" the statement said.\nThe remains were taken to the medical examiner's office to determine the cause of death.\nPolice are asking anyone with information to come forward.\nFollow @MaryBowerman on Twitter.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/ircsheriff/photos/a.205623276240858.53154.192347924235060/679218028881378/?type=3&theater"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:04:39.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
