The Oklahoma natives are releasing their newest projects — Underwood's long-awaited fifth studio album “Storyteller” and Shelton's second greatest-hits collection “Reloaded: 20 #1 Hits” — on Friday. Despite their divergent personalities and musical styles, Underwood, who hails from Checotah, and Shelton, an Ada native who lives in Tishomingo, are among the rare sure bets on the ever-shifting mainstream country music scene.
