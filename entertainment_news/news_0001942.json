Nope. I'm quite happy down here. Being in an aeroplane is challenging enough.\" \nKate and Ned wed in 2012 and they welcomed their first child together, a son named Bear, a year later (13), while she also has a teenage daughter named Mia from her first marriage to director Jim Threapleton. \nHer second husband, filmmaker Sam Mendes, is the father of her other son, Joe.
