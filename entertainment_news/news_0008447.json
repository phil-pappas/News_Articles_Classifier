(Photo: Boom! Studios)\n10 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Dark Knight got his Batman Begins , so iconic comic-book writer Grant Morrison felt Santa Claus deserved a similar superhero treatment.\nThe bearded Man with the Bag receives an origin story full of fantasy and myth with Klaus , a six-issue Boom! Studios series by Morrison and artist Dan Mora debuting in November that shows how Old St. Nick goes from fantasy warrior to becoming the holly jolly character everybody knows.\nBut, Morrison says, “I’m deliberately trying to create a much ‘cooler’ alternative to the rotund, product-pitching Coca-Cola Santa.”\nHe chats with USA TODAY about his version of this Christmastime legend:\nDescribe the personality of your take on Santa.\nWhen we first meet Klaus, he’s a deep, dark, solitary and taciturn young reindeer herder with a tragic past. He lives far from human company on the shores of a vast frozen lake. His only companion is an albino wolf he’s tamed, named Lilli (Norwegian for “white”), and he starts out as more of a Grizzly Adams character than any previous version of Santa Claus. Our Klaus is a big, tough, hard man with a quick temper, a searing hatred of bullies and authority, and a natural instinct to protect kids and the weak.\nWhat real-world history stuff did you pull from for Klaus?\nI’m referencing the whole history and development of the Santa Claus concept, from Siberian shamanic roots in the hallucinogenic red-and-white amanita muscaria mushrooms — the potent ingredients of which were often imbibed by adepts after being strained through reindeer urine (seriously) — to legends of Odin and the Wild Hunt, to the Norwegian semi-pagan Julernisse and St. Nicholas, all the way to Coca-Cola’s popularization of those psychedelic mushroom colors and the 21st-century portrayals of Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, etc.\nThe setting for \"Klaus\" is an old Norwegian town not unlike that of \"Frozen.\" (Photo: Boom! Studios)\nDo you go old school with the setting and tone?\nThe story, like Frozen , is set in a fantasy, fairy-tale version of 17th-century Norway. The fictional town of Grimsvig, where the story is set, is far from historically accurate although we’ve included just enough period detail to make it almost convincing. The tone is somewhere between The Hobbit and Maleficent, so it’s maybe not for very young kids but otherwise this is intended for a wide age range.\nHow do you explore Krampus as Santa’s darker \"shadow\"?\nWell, I don’t want to give away too much but the origin of Krampus is a little more of a “science fiction” take than any previous versions. This question is answered in the big second-act twist of the story, so I can only urge readers to wait until then for the reveal!\nWhat intrigues you about this cultural mythology we have for him?\nI was drawn to the idea of framing Santa Claus as the world’s most famous superhero; the one most kids would already have a powerful identification with —and the one owned by no corporation. Anyone can tell Santa stories but no one had done him as a superhero, even though he easily fits the mold with his uniform, the flying machine, the headquarters in the frozen north, the incredible powers and the rest. There was also the question of what does Santa Claus do on the other 364 days of the year, which seemed to suggest infinite storytelling possibilities.\n10 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1RyeII9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyeII9&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/32d5f1ba4ee61121e09eb25aebf32d5a86c1d399/r=263x400/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799929239321811-Klaus-001-C-Incentive.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyeII9&text=Morrison%27s%20%27Klaus%27%20focuses%20on%20superhero%20Santa&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/746673bd74be58abae0206d49ad26c2359510e7f/c=0-64-2999-2319&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799929148685230-Klaus-001-002-003-Color.jpg", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/284201104/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-ZUhnNFHPoCgKy1haxpCN&show_recommendations=true", "http://usat.ly/1RyeII9", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799929239321811-Klaus-001-C-Incentive.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc23c290827c1378b00e5bb90f74461724c4c145/c=0-303-1594-2428&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799929239321811-Klaus-001-C-Incentive.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:52:04.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
