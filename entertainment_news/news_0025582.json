The Borough of Jenkintown was the childhood home of real-life Adam Goldberg, who navigated the 1980s suburbs with a best friend and a video cam. The richness of that neighborhood and the adventures that unfolded there provided a creative spark for Goldberg, resulting in a hit series for which he serves as creator and executive producer.\nThe landmarks that are integral to the sit-com continue to draw interest today, so much so that the Valley Forge Tourism & Convention Board lists the locations on its website as a resource for visiting fans.\nHere are some reasons to walk in the footsteps of one of Montgomery County’s famous native sons:\nThe borough of Jenkintown, where Goldberg grew up on Newbold Road, is now a sought-after foodie destination and a place to enjoy arts and culture.\nIn terms of where to eat, Goldbergs fans like the West Avenue Grill (part of the Piazza on the Square), enjoying photos of the real-life Goldberg family on the wall – as well as hoping that they stop by (which they often do).\nIf do-it-yourself foodies frequent the Farmer’s Market. As a vibrant embodiment of the farm-to-table trend, the market is open on Wednesdays until November 23.\nOn the cultural scene, Jenkintown and its surroundings offer:\n The Abington Art Center, where an outdoor display of sculpture, against an ever-changing backdrop of scenery The Keswick Theatre, a premier concert venue with a healthy roster of top-notch talent The Stoogeum, a place that, given his affinity toward comedy, Adam Goldberg would love. It’s a three-story tribute to The Three Stooges.\nAlverthorpe Park has been mentioned on The Goldbergs as a high-school party destination, but in reality, it has a more sedate (and legal) side as well. The park allows overnight camping, has lake for fishing, gives kids plenty of energy-burn in an extensive playground and features a miniature nine-hole golf course.\nThe go-to shopping destination for the Goldberg family when it comes to clothing is Willow Grove Mall. It’s a good choice; the three levels of this retail destination contain more than 130 stores. The footprint has plenty of history: It was the site of a former amusement park that drew thousands of visitors throughout an 80-year history. The mall pays tribute to its forebear through a series of carousel horses used as artistic points of interest.\nAdam Goldberg’s best childhood friend (and video sidekick) was Chad Kremp, who lived across the street. The Kremp family, like the Goldbergs, really did reside in Jenkintown, and Chad and his brothers now operate a renowned florist business, Kremp Florist. The shop is not only an exercise in beauty, but it holds one-of-a-kind gift items, a beautiful koi pond, a chatty parrot and an extensive array of greeting cards.\nLike every other kid in the 1980s, Adam Goldberg was swept up by the Star Wars phenomenon, making the premier of Return of the Jedi at the Hiway Theater a must-go event. The Hiway boasts more than 100 years’ history in providing entertainment, going back to the silent days of film. Its restoration has included the return of its trademark neon sign, and the current rotation of films includes first-run features, art films, children’s fare and plenty of big-screen classics.\nA nearby roller rink was the subject of a not-so-magical daddy/daughter day out in Season One. Although no roller-skating rink exists in Jenkintown today, The Rink on Old York Road does offer public ice skating on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Event space can be rented for parties, and the rink offers lessons in both figure skating and hockey.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13014802.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13014802.htm"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:24:34.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
