READ MORE: We Thought Sam Smith's 'Bond' Song Sounded Familiar... \nWith his single, ‘Writing’s On The Wall’ , Sam succeeded where Madonna, Paul McCartney and Adele before him all failed, by managing to top the UK singles chart with a track from a ‘007’ film, in his case, the forthcoming ‘Spectre’. \nSam Smith \nSpeaking about the accolade, Sam said: “It was such an honour to be asked to write and record Writing’s On The Wall and it’s incredible that it’s become the first Number 1 Bond theme song. \n\"It’s been an unforgettable experience working with Barbara [Broccoli] and Sam [Mendes] to become part of this British legacy. I couldn’t have done this without my fans - this is a special moment I’ll never forget.\" \nSam unveiled the track earlier this week, after months of denying his involvement with the forthcoming ‘Bond’ film, which will be Daniel Craig’s fourth outing in the iconic role. \nHe admitted earlier this week: “I was told to deny, deny, deny. So that’s what I did. I think it worked a little bit because there was obviously that thing that happened with Radiohead and stuff, so I thought my lies worked a little bit. I didn’t lie for nothing. As a little kid I mastered it, trying to get sweets and stuff from my mum and dad. I’m not proud of it. \n“It’s only over the past few weeks that it’s really started to become real life for me. It’s been a dream of mine to do this… for any singer it’s a dream to do this song, and to be honoured with this.\"   The iconic original: John Barry's definitive arrangement of Norman's signature music for the character as introduced in Dr. No. As later Bond composer David Arnold told me for my book The Music of James Bond: \"It represented everything about that character, soundwise, that you would want. It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark and dangerous. It was suggestive, sexy and unstoppable, all in two minutes.\" Certainly one of the all-time great Bond songs, if not at the very top, for its sensual John Barry tune, provocative Don Black lyric (\"touch it, stroke it and undress it\") and powerful Shirley Bassey vocal. This was Barry's fifth song for the Bond franchise and made England's top 40 in early 1972. John Barry's third assignment for Bond, his personal favorite, his first original song for the series and the one that established, for all time, the sassy, brassy style of Bond music. It gave Shirley Bassey her first big hit in America; the soundtrack knocked both \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Beatles '65\" out of the top spot on the Billboard album charts and stayed there for three weeks. Wistfully romantic, with a hint of tragedy in its melody line, this John Barry-Hal David ballad was written for Bond's love affair and short-lived marriage in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The wonderful Louis Armstrong vocal finally scored 25 years later in the U.K. after being used in a Guinness beer spot. Amazing that this song was written over just a couple of days as a last-minute replacement for the jettisoned \"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\" and sung with gusto by the great Tom Jones. Lyricist Don Black was dubious about writing a song called \"Thunderball,\" but he and composer John Barry scored big with this one, driving the album into the top 10. Among the most gorgeous of all the more romantic Bond melodies – which include the mystical \"Moonraker\" and the soaring \"All Time High\" – this John Barry-Leslie Bricusse tune was sung by the then-hot Nancy Sinatra (off her hit \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\") and reached no. 11 in the U.K. Next to the Bond theme, this music is probably the greatest instrumental of the series, a contemporary march spiced with Bond sass and Moog synthesizer sounds that were very cutting-edge in 1969. Legendary producer Phil Ramone programmed the Moog sounds for Barry in London. An unexpectedly delicate, solo-piano start for one of the best Bond themes of the 1970s, courtesy of composer Marvin Hamlisch (then coming off Oscars for \"The Way We Were\" and \"The Sting\" and a Tony for \"A Chorus Line\"). Carly Simon sang Carole Bayer Sager's clever lyrics to an Oscar nomination and a no. 2 berth on the Billboard charts. She managed to sneak in a mention of the film's title, The Spy Who Loved Me, halfway through the song. First of the Bond themes to be penned by an established rock 'n' roller: Paul McCartney, then with his band Wings (with an assist by wife Linda, who wrote the reggae-styled midsection). Add the explosive power of an orchestra conducted by arranger-producer George Martin (who won a Grammy for it) and you have the first Bond song ever nominated for an Oscar (and which went to no. 2 on the U.S. charts.) In 1981, Sheena Easton so wowed 007 title designer Maurice Binder with her looks that he actually filmed her and incorporated her into the title sequence, the only time a Bond vocalist has actually appeared in the titles singing the song. Rocky composer Bill Conti was Oscar-nominated along with lyricist Mick Leeson. The hardest-edged Bond song of all, written by five-time Bond composer David Arnold and singer Chris Cornell for Casino Royale, the 2006 franchise-reboot with new Bond Daniel Craig. Set against extraordinary playing-card inspired visuals in the film, it's stunning to watch and, as a song, both appropriate to the film's high-stakes gambling and a testosterone-fueled anthem for the new Bond.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:23:23.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
