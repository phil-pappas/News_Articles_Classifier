(Love Productions/BBC/PA) \nShe told BBC Breakfast: “It feels like I’m relieving that moment again. It was one of the best moments of my life. \n“My husband (Abdul) tried to get me to apply two years ago and I said, ‘look, I don’t have the confidence to do something like this’, and this year he pretty much forced me and said, ‘you’re really good, you’re really clever, you should just do it, what’s the worst that will happen?’. \n“Those were famous last words. And I did it, and I went in and I applied and every stage of the process felt unlikely and like it wasn’t meant to happen.
