It also is one he probably never expected. \nStrip hotels will simultaneously display a marquee message celebrating the life and accomplishments of “Iron Chef” Kerry on Sunday, Oct. 18, at 7 p.m. \nA Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority official said, “It is in honor of the contributions he made to our culinary scene and the imprint he made on the destination overall.” \nThe salute takes place one hour after the three-hour “Celebration of Life” party at the Keep Memory Alive center in Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health where he was treated downtown.

Magician Criss Angel will return to Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut on Monday to host a public water-escape performance featuring Spencer Horsman, one of the star illusionists in his magic ensemble “The Supernaturalists.” \n“Spencer must put it all on the line if he wants to conquer this life-threatening challenge once and for all,” said Criss, who also revealed that Spencer will retire the act if next Monday’s attempt fails again. \n“The Supernaturalists” will return to Foxwoods this fall as the show, with Criss in an exclusive world premiere, resumes two limited runs from Nov. 11-15 and Dec. 16-20. \nFormer Luxor chief Felix Rappaport, now president and CEO of Foxwoods, said: “Criss Angel’s genius in creating many of the most difficult stunts ever witnessed in the history of magic will make this event truly unforgettable. Although Spencer is a world-class performer, his willingness to even attempt this feat yet again is unimaginable.” \nWICKED WHISPERS & RACY RUMORS \nThe FBI has been brought in to investigate the “catfishing” identity theft of a female Las Vegas reality-TV star by a woman who posed as a man and posted false sexual claims on the Internet.

They were touched by the story from Danielle Fullmer, a young lady from Arizona who shared the heartbreak and sweet story of love and loss: \n“I was a girl who was raised on classic rock! My dad had a record collection like no one else. I got engaged to a man who my dad thought the world of on Easter 2014. My dad was ecstatic! Sadly, on May 25, 2014, my dad passed away in his sleep. He passed away listening to his iPod. My fiance and I listen to his playlist daily. He was so happy I found such an amazing man, and this wedding would put a huge smile on his face. I saw ‘Raiding the Rock Vault’ four days after my dad passed away. We felt him in that room. He was smiling from dimple to dimple.” \nDanielle will exchange vows with Matthew Bertrand as “Raiding the Rock Vault” lead singer Paul Shortino officiates at 11 a.m. Saturday, and the public is invited to attend.

If you have a story that ends with being taken to an emergency room, they want to hear from you. It can be any type of accident but preferably one that rings to the tune of “only in Las Vegas.” \nFor example, a story about when somebody got drunk, did something stupid and injured himself; a stripper who fell off a pole and broke her wrist; an accident at a local gun range; a fight at a wedding chapel that led to injuries; a bachelorette party gone awry leading to hospital treatment; or a performer’s acrobatic stunt mishap. \nChosen participants will have their stories re-enacted and receive compensation for a TV interview. The producers want only legitimate stories, as they will be verified with hospital records. The show is in production here.
