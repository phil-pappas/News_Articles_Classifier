It had to have been the ol’ construction workers pulling a fast one. But not so fast. It wasn’t the ol’ construction workers pulling a fast one. The body was instead a real murder victim.\nChillicothe resident Tammy Dixon reconstructed the grisly discovery to local news station WCMH, saying that the body “was with one arm up like this, about four feet off the ground and hanging from the fence.”\nWorkers arrived the next day. Realizing that they were construction workers and no one among them had a decorative bone in their body, they took a closer look at the mysterious corpse and found that it was a woman who had been beaten and left on the fence.\nResidents of Chillicothe figured that the victim was another addition to a murder mystery that has cast a black cloud over the town. Since last year, six women have disappeared, with four deceased.\nBut on Tuesday, the police found the suspect, who was not connected to the other murders. Officers also identified the body, who turned out to be 31-year-old Rebecca Cade. Police deduced that Cade was running away from her pursuant and tried to climb over the fence. The suspect caught up to her and delivered blunt force trauma to her head, and officers said that Cade also had defensive marks on her arms.\nThe suspect, Donnie Cochenour Jr., was arrested on Tuesday.\nErrrm...Happy Halloween?\nh/t NBC News", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dismissed-halloween-prop-body-turns-out-be-murder-victim-n445921?cid=sm_tw&hootPostID=9b0de5bc7ea99618dc72a3e96d7667e6", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/serial-killer-fears-sparked-after-four-women-dead-two-others-n382331"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:31:49.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
