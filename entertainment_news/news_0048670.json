Having trouble coming up with decorations for Halloween this year? Try inflating a life-size Jabba the Hutt on your lawn this holiday season.\nThinkGeek has unveiled an officially-licensed lawn ornament resembling the most notorious gangster in the galaxy, which stands 6-feet tall and 10-feet long.\n“Star Wars” fans will have to fork over $170 if they want to get this decoration.\nSome customers have already requested for there to be accessories included with the Jabba the Hutt inflatable — such as a Santa hat, a pumpkin and Valentine hearts — so he can be displayed on more than one occasion.\n\"It's not like you have to keep him on your lawn either,\" ThinkGeek said on its website . \"Stick him in your den. Put him in your garage. Just don't put him in your bedroom. That's creepy.\"\nJabba also has the ability to light up and includes a blower fan, AC adapter, 2 stakes and tether ropes.\nThere's a minimum age of 14 and ThinkGeek emphasizes that the Jabba the Hutt inflatable is not to be worn as a costume.\nkcasino@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories John Boyega reduced to tears by 'Star Wars' script", "external_links": ["http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ilvr/?cpg=cj&ref=&CJURL=&CJID=2617611"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:11:48.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
