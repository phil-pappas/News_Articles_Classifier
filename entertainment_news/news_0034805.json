I’m the brains behind the success.” \nThe 63-year-old also opened up about his upcoming daylong boot camp, The Entertainment Industry: How Do I Get In? \n“Let me tell you what it’s not — that I’m trying to cash out on Beyonce,” he said. “Nothing to do with that.” Guided her career ...

So it’s not something that’s new.” Family ... Beyoncé Knowles with her now-divorced parents Mathew and Tina Knowles in 2005.

He’s also booking events in New York City, Washington DC, Baltimore and Virginia in the near future. \n“As an educator, most people don’t know, I taught for 10 years at the collegiate level. For eight years I’ve taught here in Houston at Texas Southern University,” he explained. “As an educator, this is what I do for a living. This seminar is just an extension of that.” Father, daughter flashback \nThe seminar features a short video of Beyonce talking about failure. Despite no longer managing the 7/11 singer, Knowles added that his relationship with his superstar daughter remains positive. \n“I spent the day with Blue Ivy and Beyoncé a couple of months ago,” he said. “And actually hope to see them next week or the week after and spend another day doing Play-Doh with Blue Ivy.” Pop star ...

Prices range from $US99 for students to $US299 for the VIP experience, which includes lunch with Knowles and a photo. \nAll participants will get a certificate of completion and a reference book with a glossary of industry definitions and helpful contacts.
