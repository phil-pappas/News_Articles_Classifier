But now, unfortunately for the ladies, apparently he's off the market. \nWhen asked by Andy Cohen, the host of Watch What Happens Live! , if he was \"single, dating, looking\" Thursday night, the host of Live with Kelly and Michael revealed his dating status. \n\"I'm in a serious relationship,\" he said. \nShocked by his admission, Cohen replied: \"Is that right?\" \n\"You want me to give you the full name?\" the former New York Giants player teased, before adding, \"None of your business.\" \nThis is the first serious relationship Strahan has made public since he and Murphy called off their five-year engagement in August 2014. \nStrahan said since then, he's learned to keep his love life out of the public eye. \"You know one thing I've learned, the whole public relationship thing doesn't work,\" Strahan explained. \"It doesn't work. So I prefer to do my own thing and live my life away from that. Puts too much pressure on it.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
