Utilizing its deep knowledge of the interconnect & settlement space gained with iXTools, the company solved a fundamental business problem with iXLink--automated interconnect & settlement information exchange. Telarix now has essentially every global CSP as an iXLink member, giving it a major ongoing advantage in this market space.\"\nUnder the umbrella of iXTools, the iXConnect, iXRoute, iXTrade, iXBill, and iXAudit cluster of solutions provide CSPs with a comprehensive management, optimization, and settlement interface for their interconnect business. iXTools can be deployed using licensed, hosted, or Software as a Service (SaaS) models.\nWhile the Telarix iXTools suite shares similarities with competitor offerings, the iXLink system is unlike anything else in the market today. An open, secure, global business information exchange, iXLink has secured its place as the de-facto information exchange tool in the interconnect & settlement landscape. More than 4,000 iXLink members generate in excess of 40 million iXLink-facilitated transactions per month. \nFrost & Sullivan Best Practices Awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service, and strategic product development.
