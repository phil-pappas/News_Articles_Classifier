Dreams. Awful childhood traumas, and how we keep them bottled up. Loss. 9/11. The United States of surveillance. Memory. Fear. The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Lou Reed. \nThese are just some of the things Laurie Anderson touches on in \"Heart of a Dog,\" her new... \nMovie? Well, maybe. Art installation? That might be a little closer to the mark. Her film unfolds like a series of spoken-word pieces – the kind you might have heard once in an East Village café, with a found-art video show and someone noodling on an electric keyboard. \nThat may not be for you, but for someone who's fondly followed Anderson since \"O Superman,\" it made for a pretty interesting hour. \nThe downside is, the film itself runs an hour and a quarter; most scenes eventually overstay their welcome, at least by a few minutes here and there. But the whole of the experience is still marvelously unique, and completely Laurie Anderson. \nThe film begins as a sort of meditation on her dog, a spunky terrier named Lolabelle, and if you're a dog lover you know where this is going to go. After all, most of us, when we get a new pooch, know we're going to outlive her. She, meanwhile, doesn't have a clue. It's just part of what makes the relationship so unequal, and so bittersweet. \nBut while the animal's here, we adore them. And it should be no surprise that even a punky avant-garde artist married to the ever-scowling Lou Reed could still be a total mush when it comes to her pet, and maybe sometimes a bit of a nut (when Lolabelle started to go blind, to keep her interested and active, Anderson gave her art and music lessons). \nAnd again, pet lovers will understand and forgive. \n\"Heart of a Dog\" is about much more than the love of a canine, though. Mostly, it's about mortality – because, over the course of the film, Anderson will reflect on nearly fatal accidents from her childhood, the terror of the Twin Towers attack and her aging mother's own approaching demise. (Never explicitly mentioned, until the end – the passing of Reed .) \nYet Anderson does all of this in her own, determinedly personal ways. Much of the movie unfolds as if through a window – one frequently streaked with rain, or the imperfections of old film, adding literal layers to what we're seeing. And a lot of what we do see is deliberately blurred anyway, like smudged water colors. \nBut that's fitting, as this entire movie is literally impressionist – built on feelings, created out of moods. Because when it comes to death, facts are beside the point. Sometimes all you need to see are bare trees. Or a wintry landscape. Or a small dog, too sick and tired to stand. \nAnderson narrates the entire piece, and her voice begins to grate after a while – a little too precisely mannered, a bit too deliberately artificial. And, again, even at 75 minutes, her film could use some trimming – particularly when we start diving deep into Buddhist philosophy. \nBut it still has a very real message for anyone who's ever suffered a loss – which is, frankly, all of us. And it has something no other film does or could: Laurie Anderson's quirky singular signature on every frame. \nRatings note: The film contains nothing to offend. \n'Heart of a Dog' (Unrated) Abramorama (75 min.) Directed by Laurie Anderson. Now playing at the Film Forum in New York. ★ ★ ★ \nStephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhitty@gmail.com . Follow him on Twitter @stephenwhitty.
