Blindfolded with cotton patches covering his eyes and guided by his friend, I met Haroon Mirza at the doorway of the world-famous Villa Savoye in Poissy, France, with its easily-recognizable ground-level pilotis. This emblem of formal simplicity that was a manifesto for Modernist architecture from the interwar period was where he had staged his exhibition, The Light Hours , in 2014. Having first visited the villa blindfolded about a year prior to the show, he then produced the work in his London studio. So why the eye patches, I ask? Mirza relates that it was a scary, nerve-wrecking yet fascinating experience to do a show blindfolded, the idea being to feel everything while seeing nothing, relying on all his senses except sight, as he was interested in what something looked like when you didn’t use your eyes to address it. He describes why his works often seek to engage different senses, “Because everything in Western civilization, certainly in the last few hundred years, has become ocular-centric. The visual field is more important than any other sense, and the human body isn’t really designed like that. It might be evolving like that because of ocular-centrism and media technologies, but now media technologies have changed so much that they’re actually multi-sensual. So I think it’s changing again and it’s important to understand all the senses within a creative activity rather than just one.”[caption id=\"attachment_1658\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Haroon Mirza used solar panels to power his work for the first time in The Light Hours exhibition at the Villa Savoye in 2014 (Photo Martin Argyroglo © CMN / FLC-ADAGP)[/caption] The Light Hours marked the second chapter of an initiative launched by Lab’Bel, the artistic laboratory of the French Bel Group , in 2011, in partnership with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux (France’s largest cultural heritage network overseeing monuments, parks and gardens), aimed at bringing into resonance the work of contemporary artists with icons of Modernist architecture. Thus, Mirza took over the Villa Savoye, built by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier between 1928 and 1931, by creating a vast sound and light installation – sound and light being two immaterial elements of the meeting between art and architecture – which proved to be a dialogue between the first half of the 20 th century and the beginning of the 21 st . Formerly the weekend retreat of Pierre and Eugénie Savoye and today a historic monument, the villa – originally built as a “machine for living”, given the adaptability and flexibility of the interiors in terms of function, and a machine to “move” or inspire, given the harmony of shapes and the play of light – was brought under the control of the senses: Mirza revisited Le Corbusier’s masterpiece by feeling his way around, with his senses and perceptions of the space shaken up by his blindness.[caption id=\"attachment_1659\" align=\"\" width=\"1772\"] Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye in Poissy (Yvelines) in France (Photo Jean-Christophe Ballot © FLC | Adagp. CMN, Paris)[/caption]He explains that he will only visit the villa blindfolded to keep his experience of the house intact and as a resistance to the ocular-centric idea that you must see something to experience it: “There are two main reasons for doing this: one is artistic and the other political. The former is an attempt to understand the space acoustically rather than visually. I want to limit the sensorial information I receive from the space so that the remaining (and less dominant) senses are heightened and receive more information. Thus the experience of the space changes and I am able to work completely based on the sound rather than on the visual. This kind of clues leads us to the political intentions. Contemporary culture demands that we look. The acquisition of cultural capital is overwhelmingly based on seeing things. It is the same with monuments and architecture and, of course, Le Corbusier’s house is a kind of extreme of this type of twist. Without having visited it, I was already familiar with the house. I saw it in books, on the Internet and I’ve recently been given the floor plans. Now that I’ve experienced the house blindfolded, I can develop a different relationship to it and also question the value of cultural capitalism. The idea is that I’ll never see the house with my own eyes, but I have installed and presented a work there.”[caption id=\"attachment_1665\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] The Light Hours exhibition at the Villa Savoye in 2014 (Photo Martin Argyroglo © CMN / FLC-ADAGP)[/caption]Although Mirza deprived himself of actually seeing the villa and experiencing the way natural light enters and illuminates it, given that light is one of the raisons d’être of its design, he decided to use materials that would somehow give him information about the light. Thus the use of solar panels to power his work for the first time, assembled on geometrical structures, equipped with LEDs and emitting sound in reaction to the ambient light. Basically, the light generated sounds that changed throughout the day, getting louder or quieter, depending on its intensity and shadows cast by visitors. No light, no sound. Turning light into an experience that he converted into sound, he also proposed that the light in the house determined the functionality of the work. As his assistant took detailed lux readings of each space and the manner in which light hits the building is well documented in books and online in text, 2D and 3D formats, he relied greatly on mediated representations of the house to decide on the positioning of the objects, lights and sounds in the different rooms, whose installation happened without his presence. After his assistant and the exhibition curator physically placed them, he came again blindfolded and made some changes based solely on acoustics in relation to the light activating them, as the works themselves allowed him to hear the light. Therefore, even without seeing, he was able to work just as much with the light. He says, “In a way, I’ve engaged with the house more than I would have done if I was (a) able to see the house and (b) able to work with the architecture, like making holes in the walls.”[caption id=\"attachment_1661\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Digital Switchover, 2012, control box, four active speakers, relay, DVD player, TFT monitor, LEDs, foam, variable dimensions (Photo courtesy of Lisson Gallery, London)[/caption]Basing his creation on the history and functional evolutions of the Villa Savoye, Mirza organized a vast network of acoustic vibrations, turning what Le Corbusier had dubbed the “unspeakable space” into a sound space. He notes, “The space in which a sound is presented is always imperative to how that sound is perceived. The acoustic space is very different from the visual space; it is a sphere devoid of matter, whereas the spaces we inhabit are usually solid and made up of flat surfaces, which means that sound is more malleable than any other material. Increasingly, I tend to incorporate architecture as any other readymade or existing material in my work. It momentarily becomes part of the work, which is slightly different to the idea of site specificity. The work I developed for the Villa Savoye is somehow both. But I guess that both the space and the sound generated by the work are inextricably intertwined with one another.”[caption id=\"attachment_1662\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Digital Switchover, 2012, control box, four active speakers, relay, DVD player, TFT monitor, LEDs, foam, variable dimensions (Photo courtesy of Lisson Gallery, London)[/caption]The 38-year-old London-born artist, who holds a MA in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Art and Design and a MA in Critical Practice and Theory from Goldsmiths, University of London, describes how he came to art, “I always think that everyone is an artist somehow, and it’s one of those things that you either choose to go along with or you don’t because everyone likes to make things and be creative. We all do it as children; we do it as adults all the time as well. We’re always creating as adults but we don’t choose to go with it; we choose to do other things. I’m just one of those people who chose to go with it. In terms of my work now, one thing in childhood that is relevant is the fact that I always used to take things apart and not necessarily put them back together again the way they’re supposed to be, but the way they’re not supposed to be, which is something that I do now. Another thing is being interested in how sound and light come into synchronization or things that mirror each other in some way. Otherwise, I went through the whole art school system which, in a way, gets rid of all that stuff until you find it again. It’s a strange process.”[caption id=\"attachment_1663\" align=\"\" width=\"1293\"] British artist Haroon Mirza (Photo Simon Pollock)[/caption]At the heart of Mirza’s practice is the interplay of sound and light waves with electric current and found objects in the construction of kinetic sculptures, performances and immersive installations, where the visual and the acoustic hold equal importance. For example, The National Apavilion of Then and Now is an anechoic chamber with a halo of light that grows brighter in response to increasing noise and completely dark when there is silence. In his world, things are turned upside-down: a radio buzzes with static as it spins on a turntable towards and away from a single exposed light bulb, a jet of water plays an electronic keyboard, a machine turns water into mist, a record player plays cardboard discs and old cabinets come to life. Something of an amateur scientist, he learned to concoct gadgets through a process of trial and error, with professional electricians telling him he was doing things wrong, yet he’s obviously making all the right moves. Nature interests him greatly as it is a chaotic system, and the electricity – a live, invisible and volatile element –that he uses constantly is the most natural of elements. “In a way, my work has always been about nature because electricity is also nature,” he remarks. “It’s more about the beauty of nature and the fact that we can’t control it.”[caption id=\"attachment_1664\" align=\"\" width=\"750\"] A Sleek Dry Yell featuring Richard \"Kid\" Strange, 2008, mixed media (Photo courtesy of Lisson Gallery)[/caption]A technical wizard, Mirza manipulates electricity and instructs a variety of instruments like household electronics, LEDs, secondhand furniture, video footage and existing artworks to perform in a specific way, differently than initially intended. Disruption and order are key words: he makes the defunct functional and removes the function from things that work. Some of his shows are almost symphonic and others not so easy to experience with hisses and buzzing, but all rhythmically-driven. In doing so, he breaks down distinctions between noise, sound and music, and subverts the utility and meaning of everyday objects and socio-cultural constructs. He believes that music is organized sound or organized noise; it’s just one’s perception and the context that defines it as music, noise, sound or just a nuisance. Nonetheless, there is method to his madness. He says, “There is a methodology, but there’s no fixed starting point. Sometimes it’s the context, sometimes it’s a sound, sometimes it’s a technology or media, a video, film, artist, another work. And then I add something, take something out or edit something. It just starts growing and then turns into whatever it turns into. Sometimes I have an idea of what it might end up like, but usually it never ends up like anything I imagined.”[caption id=\"attachment_1660\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Preoccupied Waveforms exhibition at the New Museum in New York City in 2012 (Photo Jesse Untracht Oakner)[/caption]Propelled into the international spotlight when he participated in the 54 th Venice Biennale (2011), where he won the Silver Lion, Mirza’s other awards include the 2010 Northern Art Prize, the 2012 DAIWA Foundation Art Prize and recently the 2014 Zurich Art Prize for which he will create a whole new body of work. Incredibly versatile, last year, he performed a new work in collaboration with composer Shiva Feshareki and the London Sinfonietta orchestra, and was tasked with co-curating “Forget Amnesia”, the fourth edition of the Fiorucci Art Trust’s annual contemporary art festival held on the volcanic island of Stromboli in Sicily. His aim at the end of the day is “to keep pushing forward and to keep discovering something” and to create “a unique synesthetic experience in time and space, which transforms in one’s memory with the passing of time”. He has succeeded in making us do just that: to listen to what we’d normally just limit ourselves to looking at and to see what we’d ordinarily just listen to.", "external_links": ["http://www.clickfolio.com/haroon/", "http://www.bel-group.com/en/group/profile", "http://www.villa-savoye.monuments-nationaux.fr/"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:57:44.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
