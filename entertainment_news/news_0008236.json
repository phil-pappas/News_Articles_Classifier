Here are the lyrics: \nYou’ve got a diamond. \nYou’ve got nine men. \nYou’ve got a hat, and a bat, and that’s not all. \nYou got the bleachers, got ’em from spring ’til fall. \nYou got a dog, and a drink, and an umpire’s call. \nWhat do you want? \nIs that a fly ball, or is it a seagull? \nComing in, from the lake, just to catch the game. \nIt’s the last inning, our guys are winning. \nDave’s put down a smoker, a strike and you got no doubt. You’re out. \nWhat do you want?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:18:42.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
