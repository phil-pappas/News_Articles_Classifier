ABC TV Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nCHRISTINE Anu is a mother hen of sorts in her new TV series Ready For This. \nThe ABC teen drama follows six talented indigenous teens who find themselves living together at Arcadia House to pursue sporting and musical dreams in Sydney. \nAnu plays Vee, one of Arcadia House's caretakers. \n\"I'm the old gal,\" Anu laughs. \n\"I've finally wound up in mother roles. This is a wonderful, talented group of young people who don't necessarily have the acting background, bar one or two of them. But because of that fresh angle there is that sense of them being themselves. They've impressed me to buggery.\" Lasarus Ratuere and Christine Anu in a scene from the TV series Ready For This. Mark Rogers \nAs the new group of young residents from all corners of Australia gather for their first dinner at Arcadia House, Vee makes it clear she's no-one's maid. \n\"It starts off as plonking a warm human body into a role that's she's out of place playing, until she realises those kids were her at one point in time, with the same dreams and aspirations,\" Anu tells APN. \n\"Even though she's adamant she's not going to be their mum and pick up after them, they become her babies. \n\"Things were about to go very fantastically well for Vee until something tragic happened in Vee's life. It's wonderful how this vested interest in these young people helps her find the true meaning in life.\" \nProduced by the team behind Dance Academy and Redfern Now, Ready For This stars small-screen newcomers Majeda Beatty and Liam Talty alongside Madeleine Madden (Redfern Now, The Code), Aaron McGrath (Glitch, The Code), Leoni Whyman (Redfern Now: The Telemovie) and Christian Byers (Underbelly: Badness, Puberty Blues). \n\"This is the first teenage drama of its kind written with all these indigenous faces on there,\" Anu says. \n\"If you love Dance Academy then you'll love this show.\" \nReady For This debuts on Monday at 6.20pm on ABC3. abc tv", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:40:09.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
