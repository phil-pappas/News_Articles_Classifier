Designed to help launch the 2016 PRS Guitars S2 and SE product lineup, the 30 year old guitar and amplifier company is reaching out to unsigned guitarists through the Sonicbids social platform to find three players with that special knack for playing and demonstrating guitars for the public.\n“There are lots of great emerging guitarists out there whose voice and input about guitars would be helpful to other players,” explained Jeanne Nooney, PRS Guitars Public Relations Manager. “As a manufacturer, we’re excited to meet these up-and-coming players and add their unique viewpoints to our website and social channels for all to see.”\nThe contest is open to all unsigned U.S. Sonicbids guitarists. Interested players will submit a short video utilizing an electric guitar. Players should tell about the guitar they are demonstrating and why they should be chosen to review the new PRS gear. Fifteen semi-finalists will be selected from all the entries by the PRS Guitars’ Marketing Team. The PRS Marketing Manager and Public Relations Manager will then choose three winners from the semi-finalists. Each of the PRS Sonicbids Guest Reviewer Contest winners will receive an S2 or SE guitar of their choice from the new PRS 2016 product lineup (valued between $629 and $1,579 USD) to keep and to use as the subject of a new guitar review for PRS’s 2016 model lineup. Reviews will be published on PRS’ website and social channels as well as the Sonicbids blog, giving these emerging artists an international audience of guitar players and music enthusiasts.\nFor full contest information and to review the terms and eligibility requirements, please visit: https://www.sonicbids.com/find-gigs/prs-guitars-s2-series-giveaway-and-featured-review\nTo learn more about PRS Guitars current product line, please visit: http://www.prsguitars.com\nAbout PRS Guitars:\nPaul Reed Smith Guitars is a leading manufacturer of high quality instruments in Stevensville, Maryland and has provided some of the world’s most renowned musicians with instruments since 1985.
