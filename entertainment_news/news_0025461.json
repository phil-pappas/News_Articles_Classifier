(AP) — A pair of former CNN journalists are suing Motel 6 after a man tried to rob the couple at gunpoint and the encounter led to an exchange of gunfire that wounded one of the former reporters.\nChuck de Caro, a former reporter, and Lynne Russell, a former anchor, say the chain does not do enough to ensure the safety of its customers. Their complaint was filed Tuesday in New Mexico Second District Court in Albuquerque.\nKRQE News 13 was first to report the lawsuit late Thursday.\nThe couple's attorney Randi McGinn said Friday that the Motel 6 in Albuquerque where the couple stayed in June is a haven for crime, and unmonitored security cameras give travelers a false sense of security.\nMotel 6 did not immediately return calls for comment.\nCrime & Justice", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:57:52.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
