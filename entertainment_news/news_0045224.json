The ceremony took place under a garden arch decorated with race medals and lasted fewer than 4 minutes. The couple toasted with Gatorade.\n\"We wanted it to be short because we knew we'd want to take some photos and then we had 18 more miles to run,\" Reinhart said.\nI spoke to the newlyweds Sunday night, shortly after their wedding reception ended at Revolución Mexican Steakhouse, not far from where they live in Lakeview. Reinhart works as an attorney for the federal government; Jockel designs equipment for a medical device company.\nThe couple met in summer 2013 through Chicago Area Runners Association , where they both trained in the 8-minute mile group to run that fall's marathon. Sunday's race was Jockel's ninth marathon and Reinhart's third. A mid-race wedding seemed fitting.\nChicago Marathon wedding Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune Stephanie Reinhart and Mark Jockel stop at mile 8 on Broadway in the \"Boystown\" neighborhood where they met their family and friends and were married by Madalyn Davidson.

You've got to do it.' \"\nEven the officiant had running ties; she was Reinhart's high school friend and fellow track teammate, who got ordained on the Internet for the occasion.\n\"We invited guests from all over,\" Jockel said. \"Washington state, Colorado, out east, and everybody made it. No one turned us down.\"\nFor their honeymoon, Reinhart and Jockel are traveling to Canada's Churchill, Manitoba, to take a polar bear trek.\n\"One of our first conversations was after the 20-miler (training run), we rode the bus back together and I hauled out my phone to show Mark pictures of the polar bears I wanted to see,\" Reinhart said. \"Now it's our honeymoon.\"\nWhile marathon officials weren't in on the couple's wedding plans, they were good sports about the whole ordeal — from the makeshift altar to the dozens of mid-race photos that bystanders and fellow runners wanted to stop and snap with the newlyweds.\nChicago Marathon wedding Bank of America Chicago Marathon Stephanie Reinhart and Mark Jockel pose as husband and wife after the 2015 Chicago Marathon.\nStephanie Reinhart and Mark Jockel pose as husband and wife after the 2015 Chicago Marathon.\n(Bank of America Chicago Marathon) \"The marathon reached out to us to say we should swing by the media center afterward,\" Reinhart said. \"And I figured it was either something really cool or it was an arrest warrant.\"\nIt was bride and groom race bibs, which the happy couple proudly donned.\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n Chicago Marathon", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bdb61/turbine/ct-photos-marathon-wedding-20151012-004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bdb6b/turbine/ct-photos-marathon-wedding-20151012-003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bde64/turbine/ct-chicago-marathon-wedding-balancing-1012-2-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:33:22.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
