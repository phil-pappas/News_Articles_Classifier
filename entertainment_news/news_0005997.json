On a recent visit, we added a side trek to Questa Lasagna, a short drive from the north entrance of the park, on a charming four-block-long stretch of Main Street in Mount Morris. It was an inviting spot, its large windows framed with a string of white lights and accented with sunflowers. Tim Knowles, the owner and chef, introduced himself and seated us promptly. The charming, brightly lit dining room had wood floors, white-cloth tables and tin ceilings. In the rear, much of the kitchen was open to the dining room. Jazz piano music provided an audio backdrop.\nIt was a happy surprise to be presented with a beer and wine list, as the website does not indicate either. The wines were all unfamiliar Italian wines, but our server did a nice job offering suggestions.\nWe started with fresh, crisp salads and an order of cheesy garlic bread ($3.50). A loaf of Italian bread was halved lengthwise, given a thorough brush with a garlicky oil and topped with an abundance of melted mozzarella cheese.\nBuy Photo The dining room at Questa Lasagna Restaurant, 55 Main St. in Mount Morris. (Photo: KATE MELTON)\nThe menu focuses on pasta; we both stuck to the namesake dish. He chose a special, a Sicilian lasagna ($18) with pepperoni, salami, sweet Italian (Sicilian) sausage, homemade meatballs and hard boiled eggs. I chose garden vegetable lasagna ($17) from the menu.\nThe generous portions of lasagnas were presented in their own oblong baking dishes. I was forewarned when it bellowed steam as I slid my fork into it. I paused — but not nearly long enough — before placing the bite into my mouth. I had to form my mouth into an \"oh\" and quickly breathe in and out to cool it from inside my mouth. It was worth it — it was the best lasagna I've had.\nThe homemade pasta was thicker than the store-bought kind, so it had a toothsome texture. The marinara sauce was full of tomato flavor. The mozzarella cheese was molten at first, than became chewy as it cooled.\nBoth my husband and I appreciated the variety in taking bites of our respective dishes. I'd somewhat firm broccoli, followed by softer roasted eggplant and then tender-crisp carrot. My husband also liked the different combinations of flavors and textures from the meats, punctuated by the occasional bit of egg.\nWhile we were eating, Tim stopped by to check on us, and we asked him a question. That launched into a conversation that included his landlord (Greg O'Connell, a former New York City detective, owns many buildings in Mount Morris as well as in Brooklyn); his pasta (it's organic, made from Canadian durum and local eggs); the history of the business (he opened six years ago, and broke through a wall into an adjoining space a couple of years ago); and more. We found him interesting and engaging but he may be a bit too loquacious for some.\nAmid our conversation, our server stopped by and offered dessert.\n\"Is the chocolate lasagna weird?\" I asked Tim.\n\"Yes, it is,\" he replied, without a pause.\nWe split an order ($6) and found the cold chocolate pasta, which had a waxy texture and a faint chocolate flavor, to be fairly weird. But we loved the ricotta mixture, which reminded us of cannoli filling, and the rich, thick chocolate ganache. A colleague, on the other hand, tells me that her family orders chocolate lasagna whenever they visit after skiing at Swain. On our next Letchworth outing, we will surely return and concentrate our appetites and calories on the exceptional savory lasagnas.\nTSCHUHMACH@Gannett.com\nQUESTA LASAGNA\nLocation: 55 Main St., Mount Morris; (585) 658-3761 or questalasagna.com .\nHours: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Wednesday; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday and Friday; noon to 9 p.m. Saturday; noon to 8 p.m. Sunday.\nAppetizers: $2 to $8.\nEntrees: $12 to $21 for dinner.\nDiet: Whole-wheat and gluten-free pastas are available for $1 extra.\nHandicap accessible: No, there is a step up into the restaurant.
