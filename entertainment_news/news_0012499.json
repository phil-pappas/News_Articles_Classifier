It's mathematically correct. By creating this ecology circle, where the leaders of the world are saving animals. If we see our world leaders are doing that, by trying to save the animals, by trying to put things on a good balance and automatically people are going to try to rearrange for a better position on earth. Earth will have a longer process of life, with people in it.\" \nWhen interviewer Colin Paterson admitted he was unsure of how Jean-Claude would get the world leaders together, the action star said \"nature\". \nHe added: \"Every leader they have a heart, and they have a wife, they have children, they understand the word love or deception. Everybody on earth has something called a good side on them. \n\"With all the people I know from a valet parking friend of mine to Mr Putin, or Mr Obama and all those big names, I know them well ... Mr Trump too, I think we can do something because this is the last chance. 2015 we can fix the world!\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:08:38.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
