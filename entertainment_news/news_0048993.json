But it’s a chaotic one: Karr is, by her own admission, “a passionate, messy teacher.”\nThe passionate part is what drew so many readers to “The Liars’ Club” (1995), a rip-roaring, child’s-eye psychodrama about her family’s life in East Texas, which she now calls “the Ringworm Belt.” The messy part leads her to create chapter headings like “Interiority and Inner Enemy — Private Agonies Read Deeper Than External Whammies.”\nKarr acknowledges that this book began with the teaching syllabus she uses at Syracuse University , where merely becoming one of her students is a major achievement. (Some, like Cheryl Strayed and Koren Zailckas, have gone on to write best-selling memoirs of their own.) She has fleshed it out with analyses of some of her favorite memoirists’ work, but she can’t help being more interesting than her lesson plans. The best parts of this book are those that veer off course and find her writing about herself again.\nMore Information The Art of Memoir\nBy Mary Karr\nHarper/HarperCollins, $24.99\nWhen she teaches Nabokov, Karr freely admits that he has little in common with the other writers she looks at most closely here: Maya Angelou , Harry Crews , Michael Herr , Frank Conroy , Frank McCourt , Geoffrey Wolff , Tobias Wolff and Kathryn Harrison .\n“He’s just your standard virtuoso aristocrat from a gilded age,” she says of Nabokov, after citing passages from “Speak, Memory” that violate her basic teaching principles.\n“Students love trying to imitate Nabokov,” she says, “which teaches them a lot — mostly about why not to imitate somebody wired so differently from yourself.” Though she doesn’t say so, she must run into even more students who try to imitate Mary Karr.\nFirst and foremost, she sees memoir writing as a way to cut a path back to the writer’s past and rediscover it. “A fierce urge to try re-experiencing your own mind and body and throbbing heart alive inside the most vivid stories from your past is Step 1,” she says.\nBut how? That’s what many of Karr’s readers will have picked up “The Art of Memoir” to find out. Although she’s a writer some of us would follow anywhere, she acknowledges that much of this book is for would-be practitioners, that it can be technical and that at its most “lapidary,” its close analyses may bore the general reader. That’s an accurate assessment. She also offers many bones of contention concerning the most basic advice this book doles out.\n“The Art of Memoir” also warns the prospective memoirist about the single person with whom you will have the most trouble: yourself. Writing a book like this requires figuring out who you are and how you want your voice to sound. No matter how long this takes, it has to be done.\n“The only way I know how to develop a voice is to write your voice into one,” advises Karr, who says she threw away 1,200 finished pages of “Lit,” her last memoir, and broke the delete key on her keyboard changing her mind.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/21/8741967/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/21/8741967/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:38:19.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
