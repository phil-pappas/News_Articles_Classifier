The letter states that Trump does not have permission to use the song or any of Tyler's other songs and that doing so \"gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid.\" \nWhile Tyler is a registered Republican and attended the first Republican debate in August, the real issue isn't politics or even a personal issue with Trump, but rather one of permission and copyright, according to a statement released by Tyler's attorney, Dina LaPolt.
