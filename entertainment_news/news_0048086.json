He is due in court Thursday to address a motion by his attorney that his indictment be thrown out due to lack of reasonable cause, court documents show.\nClark was tried by the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office on charges of assault under the color of authority, assault with a less lethal weapon, use of force causing serious bodily injury and assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. Meanwhile, the victim, Monique Hernandez, launched a civil suit in May 2013 that ended in 2014 with a $18.5 million settlement against the former officer and Beaumont, records and Hernandez’s attorney, Milton Grimes, said.\nClark pulled over the victim, Monique Hernandez, on Feb. 21, 2012, after receiving a call from her family reporting a disturbance. While trying to arrest her, Clark fired a handgun-like pepper spray device called a JPX into her eyes.\nHernandez was left permanently blind.\nClark was taken to court once, but in August 2014, after a week of deliberation, a mistrial was declared when the jury was hung with 10 in favor of conviction and two against.\nDuring Clark’s trial, prosecutors said he fired the pepper-spray gun at Hernandez’s eyes at a distance of less than a foot. The weapon, which uses gunpowder to propel the spray from the muzzle at a rate of speed about 400 mph, sliced Hernandez’s right eye in half, fractured her right orbital bone and severed the optic nerve in her left eye.\nHernandez and her family are still participating in the civil suit by providing deposition. The pepper-spray gun manufacturer is being brought in as a third-party defendant by the city of Beaumont in the civil suit, according to Hernandez’s attorney.\nAs the criminal case against Clark inches forward, the Hernandez family is hoping for a trial with a conviction, Hernandez’s attorney said.\n“(Hernandez) is an amazing person. She’s not angry… she doesn’t have any hostility,” Grimes said in a recent interview. “She wants justice and thinks (Clark) should be punished, but she doesn’t have any bitterness.”\nHernandez and her family are receiving the $18.5 million settlement on a monthly basis, but it is no replacement for her vision, the attorney said.\n“Would you accept $18 million for your vision?” he said. “Of course not. Nobody would.”\nClark’s attorney said in an emailed statement that the former officer had no idea the spray could do that kind of damage.\n“Clark and the Beaumont Police Department were taught by the manufacturer that the JPX was no different from regular aerosol OC (oleoresin capsicum, or pepper) spray,” Steven Sanchez said.\nContact the writer: psurowski@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:20:57.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
