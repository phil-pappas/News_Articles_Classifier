(AP) â€” Jimmy Fallon got the royal treatment at Harvard. \nThe Tonight Show host and Saturday Night Live alum was honored Saturday by the Harvard Lampoon, the country's oldest continuously published humor magazine. \nThe magazine awarded Fallon its Elmer Award for Excellence in Humor. \nThe comedian was crowned \"Emperor of Comedy\" and paraded through Harvard Square in a Roman chariot. The parade started by the Inn at Harvard and ended at the steps of the magazine's headquarters, Lampoon Castle, where he was presented with a trophy and an 85-cent check. \nIt's just the seventh time the undergraduate organization says it has bestowed the honor. Previous recipients include Jay Leno, John Cleese and Robin Williams. \nThe 41-year-old Fallon took over The Tonight Show from Leno last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:34:11.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
