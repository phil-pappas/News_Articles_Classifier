But in the digital age, it is no longer the only way to go. \nCase in point: Today is Chucky, The Notorious Killer Doll Day . There has been a Facebook page for some five years pushing Oct. 25 as the date in question. And little by little, it has come to be recognized on “dates of interest” blogs and websites. \nSay their names often enough, and manifestations from the past reappear. Like Candyman or Bloody Mary or Prime Minister Trudeau. \nAnd it works for me. It’s six days to Halloween. And dolls are creepy. \nFirst, a scary story. I am a notorious cynic, and have even given an address to the Canadian Skeptics Society. And yet, I’m pretty sure my son had a Big Bird doll that was demonically possessed. \nMy mom, who apparently was a member of a coven without us knowing about it, showed up with Talking, Huggable Big Bird when my younger son Jacob (now in college) was three. No off switch. Just squeeze him and he’d say, \"Peek-a-boo!\" or \"Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake baker's man!\" or he'd laugh/giggle, \"Hahahahaha – hahahahaha!\" \nExcept that the trigger switch became so sensitive, the slightest footstep, or the beating of a butterfly’s wings in China would set him off at any hour. He’d say, \"Peek-a-boo!\" when I went to bed at a late hour, or when my wife and I would try to sneak a moment alone. He’d say \"Pat-a-cake” in the middle of the night, or laugh that insane laugh. \nOne night, he just wouldn’t shut up, and I had my Edgar Allen Poe moment straight out of the Raven. Except, instead of reciting angry, absinthe-inspired poetry at it, I ran upstairs, tore Big Bird open and ripped out his battery pack as he laughed insanely. Everyone in the family was getting creeped out by him. So the fact that I destroyed one of my kids’ toys in an attack of fearful fury was treated more as a welcome act of mercy than the violent outburst of a deranged man. At least, that’s what they told me. \nIt happens that there was a spate of weird news reports about that time of talking dolls acting strangely. In Brampton, a talking Smurf reportedly said, “Who gives a f---?” In Hamilton, a Clever Cutie doll said, “I want to cut you.” They were probably all cases of factory engineers pulling pranks, but if Talking Huggable Big Bird had said any of those things, I’d have called a priest. \nAs for Chucky, he is the king of the evil dolls, and has been voiced by Brad Dourif through six films – the last of which, 2013’s Curse of Chucky, starred Dourif’s daughter Fiona. There is talk of a seventh. \nMy favourite, however, remains Bride of Chucky (1998) , in which Oscar-winner Jennifer Tilly becomes betrothed to the little monster and they have doll sex (because really, who among us hasn’t?). \nLast year gave us Annabelle, a spinoff of The Conjuring, based on an actual story told by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (an actual story being different from an actual event in crucial ways, as viewers of Finding Bigfoot can tell you). \nOther infernal dolls that come to mind include the scariest moment in the original Poltergeist, when that clown doll comes to life. And really, a clown… doll. Talk about doubling down on creepiness. \nAdd in the evil-ventriloquist’s-dummy trope – best represented by Anthony Hopkins in Magic, terrorized by a wooden partner named Corky, and our big-eyed, cartoonish representations of ourselves become a definite source of projected fear. \nPolynesians call this “mana,” a belief in the power of representative objects. Peter Friedman, who directed a documentary called Mana: Beyond Belief, once told us, “A lot of people do believe the mana of the object is the property of the object and not of the mind. \n“West African voodoo priests dress up in the costume of a revered dead person in order to experience their mana. What does an Elvis impersonator do? He dresses up in the costume of a revered dead person in order to experience his mana.” \nIn which case, we should be thankful Hitler dolls never caught on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:15:57.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
