A year later, Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death.\nIran has also offered over $3 million in reward for anyone who kills Rushdie.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:56:22.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
