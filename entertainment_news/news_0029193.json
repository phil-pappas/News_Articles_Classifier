It's a visually fun ride but the thrill is simply not there.\n\n'Pan' poster. Pic/Santa Banta \nThe dark themed children's story at the heart of it all is given the magical treatment but it plays out as gilded dust, largely. 12-year-old orphan Peter Pan (Levi Miller) spirited away to the fantastical world of Neverland, by pirates in a flying ship, discovers his true destiny and forever, thereafter, becomes known as the legendary Peter Pan.\nAt Neverland, he is made to work in the mines searching for fairy dust and is mistreated and shoved around by Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman aiming for a cross between Freddie Mercury and Johnny Depp) introduced in a musical rendition 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' through a mass chant. Pan escapes with long time resident James Hook (Garett Hedlund) in an effort to search out his mother. And eventually Peter, Hook and warrior princess Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) get together to save Neverland from the reign of terror.\nOver-the-top performances, amusing pop-references and definitive clowning around allow for some jest but the overall takeaway is less than satisfying despite the by-and-large amazing sock-it-in-your-jaw graphics animation CGI work. Some sloppy visual effects and lack of overall coherence also mar the involvement. Kids will be amused no doubt.\n\nWatch the trailer of 'Pan'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:37:04.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
