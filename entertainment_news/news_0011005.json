Khan, who seemed surprised at his sacking from the Delhi government, said that though he had given his resignation, as was asked by the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, but would come clean. \nSpeaking to the media on Friday, the sacked food minister alleged that he is a victim of some big conspiracy and would clear out the details by Saturday evening. He said, “ Ek bahut badi saazish mere khilaaf ki gyi hai, iska khulaasa mein bahut jald karunga.” He said that since the Aam Aadmi Party had asked for his resignation and the party has a clean image, so he had accepted the action against him. Khan said, “Party asked for my resignation till investigation is going on, so I tendered my resignation. Humaari party ki chhavi saaf suthri hai,humari party mein kahin bhi kisi par allegation lagta hai to uss par action lia jaata hai.” He also expressed his shock at the whole incident and said that he would only be able to comment after listening to the audio clipping.

Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “ Kejriwal ji kabhi Najeeb Jung se jung ladte hain, kabhi PM, Rajnath Singh se jung ladte hain, kabhi apno se jung ladte hain (Kejriwal sometimes fights with Najeeb Jung, sometimes with PM, sometimes with Rajnath Singh and at other times with himself).” While Congress spokesperson R P N Singh had said that this whole scenario of corruption took place in the capital when there is no Lokpal, and if it have been present, then the whole cabinet would have resigned. Singh said, “This is when there is no Lokpal in Delhi, imagine if it was there. Whole cabinet would have to resign. \nArvind Kejriwal sacked Khan for accepting Rs 6 lakh bribe from a builder. Kejriwal ousted the minister and saying he will not tolerate any kind of corruption. Ballimaran MLA Imran Hussain will be replacing Asim Ahmed Khan as the food minister.
