That was the first movie I ever saw and it gave me nightmares for weeks, that and the monkeys banging on the window. I actually climbed behind the seat and hid for half an hour!\" \nBut the film wasn't the only think the 47-year-old hunk - who has children Oscar, 15, and Ava, 10, with wife Deborra-Lee Furness - was scared of when he was younger. \nSpeaking to 12-year-old reporter Hope, who was representing education charity Into Film, about the characters in 'Pan', he said: \"I relate to Peter actually in this story. I was quite a fearful kid, I was quite outgoing but I was afraid of heights and afraid of the dark and it took me quite a while to believe in myself so I relate to him in that way.\" \nHope who attends Hackney New School, was given the chance to interview Hugh, Garrett Hedlund, Levi Miller and Rooney Mara as part of the Into Film Young Reporter programme. \nThe programme allows young people with a passion for film the chance to delve behind the scenes of the film industry by attending film events and interviewing film professionals.
