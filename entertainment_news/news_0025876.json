Series 1, 2010 – Edd Kimber \nWhen Edd was crowned the Great British Bake Off’s first winner, the show was much more low profile, airing on BBC Two. But he made the most of his win, quitting his job as a debt collector in Yorkshire to go full-time as a baker. He started with a stint at Raymond Blanc’s Michelin-starred Le Manoir restaurant in Oxfordshire before moving to London. \nEdd has gone on to author three cookbooks – The Boy Who Bakes (2011), Say It With Cake (2012) and Patisserie Made Simple (2014). He writes regular features for magazines including BBC Good Food, Delicious and Waitrose Kitchen, and runs a popular blog, theboywhobakes.co.uk. \nThe show’s first winner also held the title of “resident baker” on The Alan Titchmarsh Show, and in 2013 he had a Food Network Christmas special, John and Edd’s Christmas Bakes. Series 2, 2011 – Joanne Wheatley \nAs the Bake Off started to grow in popularity, the housewife and mother-of-three became the second winner.
