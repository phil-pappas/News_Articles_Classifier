J. Harvey released her first book of poetry on her 46th birthday on Friday -- based on journeys to Afghanistan, Kosovo and the United States.\nThe book, entitled \"The Hollow of the Hand\", is a collaboration with photographer Seamus Murphy and is based on travels between 2011 and 2014.\n\"Gathering information from secondary sources felt too far removed for what I was trying to write about,\" Harvey said in a statement released by the book's publishers, Bloomsbury.\n\"I wanted to smell the air, feel the soil and meet the people of the countries I was fascinated with,\" she said.\nMurphy said: \"It is our look at home and the world.\"\nThe two friends already worked together on Harvey's last album \"Let England Shake\", for which Murphy took photographs and shot films.\nIn January and February, two-time Mercury Prize-winner Harvey recorded her ninth studio album in front of an audience hidden by one-way mirrored glass, as if an exhibition in a gallery.\nArts & Entertainment Books & Publishing Seamus Murphy P.
