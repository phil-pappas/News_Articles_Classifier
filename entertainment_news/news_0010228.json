I doubt it.\nDo you realise that since 2000, we have not have ONE single top cop, who hasn’t had an overcrowded closet of skeletons. In other words: for the past fifteen years, we have had bloody criminals in charge of the SAPS.\nSmall wonder the cops have such a sordid soiled sorry reputation. Personally, I do not trust ANY cop – never have, never will. But that’s just me.\nOne thing is for sure: These criminals top cops are costing the country millions; and they are one of the main reasons why the SAPS has gone to the dogs.\nThere was old Jackie Selebi (2000–2009); erstwhile president of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) and president of Interpol. Selebi’s “ presidency ” at these two bodies comes as no surprise – both the ANCYL and Interpol, are bloody useless organisations. But that’s not important right now.\nIn 2007, Selebi was strongly criticised for responding to concerns over South Africa’s rising crime rate, with the comment: “What’s all the fuss about crime?”\nIn March of the same year, Selebi wanted to legalise prostitution and public drinking for the duration of the 2010 Soccer World Cup. (He probably had shares in these lucrative “businesses.”)\nOn 10 September 2007, the National Prosecuting Authority issued a warrant of arrest for Selebi for corruption, fraud, racketeering, and defeating the ends of justice.\nSelebi was found guilty of corruption on 2 July 2010 and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment. But, like all good comrades, he was released on medical parole. (He didn’t, however, take up playing golf.)\nThen we had Bhekokwakhe “Bheki” Hamilton Cele (2009–2012, suspended 2011). He, of the: “Shoot to kill, worry later,” fame. (To me, this guy looked more like a pimp than a cop. I never liked him.)\nCele was well qualified for the job as National Commissioner, having served as Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, as well as Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Transport in KwaZulu-Natal . But, mostly, because he was a member of the African National Congress , and a close friend of Number 1.\nBheki Cele was under investigation, as evidence showed R1.7 billion spent on building leases were unlawful, improper and constituted maladministration. Even though suspended, South African taxpayers still spent at least R1.3 million a year on his salary.\nA Board of Inquiry established that Cele acted corruptly, dishonestly, and with an undeclared conflict of interest in relation to two police lease deals signed with business tycoon Roux Shabangu – one for a building in Pretoria, and another for a building in Durban.\nWith that, Cele left the building with a golden handjob handshake.\nAnd then, it was the turn of Mangwashi Victoria Phiyega. An absolutely useless individual, with no police experience whatsoever. The less said about her, the better. She is not only unfit to hold office; she is unfit. Full stop.\nPhiyega, like all good comrades and cadres, has been suspended on full pay. So... the taxpayer is made to pay for an incompetent criminal with bad hairdresser.\nLastly, we have acting national police commissioner, Johannes Khomotso Phahlane, who started off by spreading the smelly brown stuff as thick as thieves. Phahlane said he would turn things around in the different police units, within six months.\nJarwellnofine, Johannes. Pull the other one. We’ve all heard these empty promises by new police brooms before.\nI’m waiting to see what skeletons are going to come marching out of Phalane’s closet. And please don’t tell me that he hasn’t got any.\nSkeleton Number One : Phahlane has been in a tussle previously with police union Popcru, which accused him of corruption. ( Where there’s smoke, Sakkie... )\nSkeleton Number Two : According to City Press, 18/10/2015, Phahlane has lashed out at his detractors within the police, who, he says, have falsely accused him of having affairs with junior colleagues and fathering their children. ( Where there’s even more smoke, Sakkie... )\nNannies Koepella", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Executive_Council", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:48:01.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
