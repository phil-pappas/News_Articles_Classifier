It had venues ranging from the sweeping front porch at town hall to the intimate settings at homes and businesses spread through more than 16 blocks. Of the dozens of volunteers who made the festival possible, one group handled transportation, giving visitors golf-cart rides throughout the expansive festival layout. The daytime acts were local and regional from as far as Wilmington and Goldsboro, with a late-afternoon finale featuring the The Carmonas from Nashville, Tenn., and Laurelyn Dossett of Raleigh. The festival is inspired by the musicians who formerly gathered on the porch of Captain Billy and Lucille Truitt’s Ol’ Store at South Water and New Streets back in the 1960s and 1970s. Ed Kobylarz and Doris Bitely came from New Bern, mainly to see the Mustangs in the car show. He said they also wanted to hear the music, since they enjoy “pickin’ and grinnin’” music most Friday night’s at the Rhems Volunteer Fire Department in Craven County. Bill and Maggie Reece of Jacksonville needed a break from all the recent rains and decided to take their 4-year-old grandson Wyatt Forsythe on a fun road trip. Bill is a classic car fan and also a “front porch picker” on banjo. “It rained three weeks in a row, so I went looking on the internet,” she said. “ I was smiling when I told him I found something to do – a car show, and music, too. The sun was shining today and we are pretty much chasing the sun.” The music festival also has arts and crafts, some located on a lot on Broad Street and others at individual homes. Beth Price of Grantsboro, who started Beth’s Pretty Pieces in 2007, said her first visit to the festival is good exposure for her work, which this time of the year features painted gourds with sparkling colors. She gets the gourds from grower Mayjack Lewis in Vanceboro and has been displaying at Mumfest for the past four years. Another musician and car enthusiast who traveled to attend was Marvin Walker, who drove from Kinston with his wife Bronda, along with their daughter Sally Doss and her sons William and Mason. “I had heard of it and saw it on Facebook,” said Marvin, who plays and makes hand-crafted banjos. He also has a number of classic vehicles – 1965 and 1940 Chevy trucks, along with a 1978 Gremlin GT, the last year of that model. Page 2 of 2 - He has played in bluegrass and gospel bands in the past and currently plays with friends for seniors at nursing homes. The car show on the waterfront had a steady crowd, with some classics such as a 1929 Ford owned by Skip Bailey of Oriental; and a 1957 corvette, a 1930 Ford A Model owned by John Reiswig of Oriental. It’s red paint job and mint-condition drew a crowd. As an aside, it also features a thermometer inside the hood ornament.
