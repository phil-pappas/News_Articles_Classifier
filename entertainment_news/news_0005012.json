I just ate. Sugar, cheese, bread and pasta … I kept shoving it in,” he says.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?

Farrell and Rachel Weisz in The Lobster. Picture: Supplied. “It was so gluttonous. It was a bit messy really. But it was just for the job, so I knew: eight weeks in., eight weeks out, eight weeks in the middle to shoot.”\nThe Lobster, which boasts a top-shelf ensemble cast that includes Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, John C Reilly and Ben Whishaw, is set in a parallel universe not too far from our own in which single people are considered to be an unhealthy aberration.\nAfter splitting from his wife, the oddly fatalistic David (Farrell) is summarily dispatched to a creepy, prison/hotel where hapless singletons are given 45 days to find a mate — after which time they are turned into an animal of their choice (David chooses the lobster of the title because of the sea creature’s long lifespan and the fact that they partner for life.)\nIf a single person manages to bag any “loners” — solitary types who have rebelled against the authorities and set up an alternative community in the woods — during one of the nightly hunts, they qualify for bonus days on their sentence.\nThe Lobster becomes a love story, of sorts, when David finds himself drawn to one of the outsiders (Weisz) — against all the rules.\nLike the majority of the cast, Farrell signed up for the project on the strength of Lanthimos’s acclaimed, earlier film, Dogtooth (such is the director’s reputation, Kate Winslet and Emma Stone have already committed themselves to his follow -up project The Favourite.)\n“I was drawn to this very unusual and awkward world,’’ Farrell says.\n“I love a good conventional love story, one that works and pulls at the heart strings, but this comes at love from a very unusual angle or a very unusual direction.\nWell matched ... Farrell and Weisz at the London premiere of The Lobster. Picture: Supplied. “Which direction that is, I couldn’t even say. But it was completely devoid of any sentimentality and in reading it, it kind of crept up on me.\n“I found it at first to be something of an intellectual exercise, to read it, because it’s so structured and the characters were so muted. They weren’t emotionally available.\n“And then slowly, bit by bit, I started to find that the story was very moving.”\nThe Lobster gains all the more poignancy from the fact that Farrell’s flat, passive and largely uninspiring character is such an unlikely cinematic “hero.”\nThe actor, who is generally cast for his brooding good looks, seems to have relished the opportunity to play someone very plain and ordinary.\n“I wouldn’t say I was liberated from handsomeness,” he says, self-depreciatingly.\n“Honestly, I just want to do interesting characters.\n“There have been times in the past when I have done a big action film and I know the character at the centre of the action film is not exactly going to be a font of eccentricity.\nChange of direction ... Farrell and Weisz strike out on their own. Picture: Supplied. “They have to be the common denominator in a big film like, say, Total Recall and they are drawn that way. But then you read something like this and it is very specific. You just want to align yourself with the clarity of vision the writers had in creating the character.”\nConfirming just how far removed he is from his on-screen alter ego, Farrell, who has been officially single since he spilt up with Ondine co-star Alicja Bachleda-Curus in mid-2010, says that if he had to choose an animal to come back to earth as, he’d opt for something airborne.\n“Maybe an apex predator, something with a bit of speed — a falcon perhaps. I have had dreams of flight in my time.”\nFarrell recently joined the cast of the upcoming Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, starring Oscar-winning British actor Eddie Redmayne, and set in New York 70 years before the original franchise begins.\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Farrell will play the wizard Graves.\n“I don’t know my (two) boys well enough to be guaranteed that they are going to like this film, but it is nice to do something that they can choose to see — or not — because they haven’t been able to see anything I have done” he says of sons James and Henry.\n“Not that I want to inflict that upon them. They are sick of looking at me anyway!”\nThe Lobster opens on Thursday.\nOriginally published as Farrell sets the record straight", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1b8196d378545a40b81428ac5c711d9c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f9d2d153486f3fa3de6156d26f463fd0?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/99fcba8ae82c8c3a820d363ee6835cce", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/88699b289612ca6d520aee7f2c0523d0?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c5cae69f6310b1ac75aa7260fd194394", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0eb27853091a774fcb6de188930e46b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2f9fc4402b5b9668690b6e47a81809b6?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8f3fc487c88364970742ba4bbaf99415", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/thats-no-fat-suit-says-lobster-star-colin-farrell/story-e6frfmw0-1227571713337?sv=c8ba60b99087ea8c10bd78fc3e0baf18", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/273f8d21f4a54f0720388382dc1eee50", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:28:32.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
