Democrats in the state Assembly are awaiting final approval to allocate about $16.6 million in old, unspent member-item grants dating back to 2003, which are designated to go to select nonprofits and local governments picked by individual lawmakers, records reviewed by Gannett's Albany Bureau showed.\nKnown in Albany as \"pork,\" member items have long been criticized by good-government advocates, in large part because it allows lawmakers to direct grants to pet projects with little oversight and to curry favor with voters.\nBut while new funding for traditional pork has been stripped out of the state budget since 2010, a similar system has all but taken its place.\nIn addition to the unspent pork, the Legislature last week detailed how it plans on spending $110.6 million from the State and Municipal Projects Fund, state records showed. The fund is a $1.1 billion pot of money that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and individual state lawmakers can direct via grants to chosen local governments or schools, but not nonprofits.\nAll told, the state Legislature since July has released details about $127.2 million in local, lawmaker-requested grants.\n\"It's sort of the same old, same old of what we've seen in Albany,\" Westchester County Rob Astorino, the Republican candidate for governor last year, said. \"Unfortunately, it could be a contributing factor to some of the corruption that we've seen over the years.\"\nCritics also said that the spending is unfairly distributed, with the vast majority of it earmarked for lawmakers in the Senate's Republican and Assembly's Democratic majorities.\nBut it has support from many local governments and some members of the Legislature, who say lawmakers have a localized understanding of their district and which projects deserve funding.\n\"I think it's a good way to assure that communities are provided with assistance that is appropriate and real in terms of what the need is,\" said Assemblywoman Ellen Jaffee, D-Suffern, Rockland County. \"We listen. We're out there. We're listening on a regular, daily basis and hearing what they say, and this is a way we can respond.\"\nProjects large and small\nThe latest round of grants was largely flagged for smaller, mostly local projects, including $100,000 for a series of park upgrades in the city of Binghamton — secured by now-former Sen. Thomas Libous, R-Binghamton — and $125,000 to renovate the village of Nyack's senior center, which was recommended by Jaffee.\nThere are some exceptions: The largest single grant was secured by Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, D-Irondequoit, Monroe County, and went to the city of Rochester. The grant is for $13.4 million for new police cars and infrastructure repairs, including a partial roof replacement at City Hall and new curbs and sidewalks in parts of the city.\nThe origin of the grants differs from organization to organization. Some reached out to lawmakers for financial help. Others were contacted by lawmakers. Libous, who has since been ousted from the Senate after a felony conviction, set up a website last year — libousgrant.com — to allow local governments to apply for his allocation.\n\"It was something that came across as a result of our asking for help for our 2015-16 budget,\" said Christopher Wagner, Rochester's budget director. \"It was a way to provide some budgetary relief to the city in the form of capital funding.\"\nWhen combining the old member-item spending and State and Municipal Project Fund grants, Morelle secured more than any other lawmaker: about $13.7 million total.\nIn a statement, Morelle spokesman Sean Hart said Rochester receives less state funding on a per-capita basis than other upstate cities. The grant was \"essential to (Rochester's) fiscal stability and will support a number of important community priorities,\" Hart said.\nRanking second was Senate Independent Democratic Leader Jeffrey Klein, D-Bronx, who has allied himself with the chamber's Republican majority. He secured a total of $11.7 million in State and Municipal Fund grants over the past three years, including $1.5 million for the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and $295,000 for projects in Pelham and Pelham Manor in Westchester County.\nCandice Giove, a spokeswoman for Klein, emphasized the funding went to \"worthy\" government projects, including park renovations and public-housing improvements.\n\"Senator Klein consults with the residents of his district and local leaders to decide where money is most needed and delivers,\" Giove said.\nPower and money\nThe funding is skewed toward the parties in power and the more-senior lawmakers.\nParity has long been a point of contention for critics of legislative earmarks, given that each senator and assembly member has roughly the same amount of people living in their districts.\nOf the $16.6 million in old member-item spending, none went to Republicans. Of the Assembly's $36 million of State and Municipal Project Fund grants, about $34 million went to Democratic districts.\nOn the Senate side, all of the chamber's $74.7 million in State and Municipal Project Fund grants — which were spread over the past three years but revealed last week — went to lawmakers who conference with the Senate Republicans or the five-member Independent Democratic Conference, which is allied with the GOP.\nThere are currently 31 Republicans and 30 Democrats in the 63-seat Senate, with two vacancies. One Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder of New York City, sits with the GOP.\nAssemblyman Phil Palmesano, R-Corning, Steuben County, said the funding should be split more evenly among Republicans and Democrats. He secured a $100,000 grant for Steuben County to purchase excavation equipment to share with neighboring counties.\n\"I've always said that these types of programs should be made equally available to the members on both sides of the aisle,\" Palmesano said. \"In my opinion, whether you're in the majority or the minority or the Assembly or the Senate, you should have equal distribution. That's not the case as it is right now.\"\nThe $1.2 billion fund is split between Cuomo and the Legislature, with the lawmakers' portion controlled by the parties in control of the two houses.\nMeanwhile, about $67.3 million in old member-item funding — which dates back to as far as 2003 — remains unspent, according to Cuomo's budget office. Of that, the Senate has about $1.3 million left, Cuomo's administration has $21.3 million and the Assembly has $43.9 million, which includes the $16.6 million awaiting approval from the budget office.\n'Slush fund'\nWhen asked Wednesday about the State and Municipal Project Fund, Cuomo dismissed the comparison to the traditional pork-barrel spending, noting that the new fund only allows grants to governments, not nonprofits.\nCuomo also didn't find fault with the fact that the majority of money is controlled by the parties in power in the Legislature.\n\"That the majority has more power in the Legislature? Yeah, that's what's called being the majority,\" he said.\nSome past lawmakers found themselves in legal trouble for directing pork spending to nonprofits controlled by allies, including ex-Sen. Pedro Espada, a Bronx Democrat who is serving a five-year prison sentence for embezzling money from a healthcare network he founded. Former Hudson Valley Sen. Vincent Leibell was also convicted in a corruption case that was in part tied to his member-item spending.\nKenneth Girardin of the Empire Center, an Albany-based, fiscally conservative think tank, likened the State and Municipal Projects Fund to a \"slush fund.\" Some of Cuomo's grants, he noted, have gone to private companies with the blessing of the state's economic-development arm, including $5 million to CBS to renovate the theater housing the \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\nThe recipients of the funding said they were grateful to receive any state support they can get.\n\"It's an integral part of the building of our new museum,\" said Andrea Winograd, executive director of the Holocaust Museum and Study Center in Suffern, Rockland County, which is slated to receive a $5,000 grant from Jaffee. \"We have a longstanding, wonderful relationship with (Jaffee).\"\nBinghamton Mayor Richard David said the $100,000 grant his city received helped the city upgrade the playground at MacArthur Park and renovate baseball and softball fields at West End and Valley Stream parks.\nHe said he's concerned, however, for the city's ability to obtain similar grants in the future, given that Libous had been one of the Senate's most powerful members prior to his ouster . The remainder of Libous' two-year term will be filled on Election Day next month.\n\"No matter who the next senator is to represent the Southern Tier, whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, that person will be a freshman senator and will start from the very bottom with regards to seniority,\" said David, a Republican. \"That person won't have the same amount of clout or political access and won't be able to deliver in the same manner that Senator Libous did.\"\nJCAMPBELL1@gannett.com\nTwitter.com/JonCampbellGAN\nFindings\n• Assembly Democrats are awaiting approval to distribute $16.6 million in old, unspent member items -- known colloquially as \"pork\" -- to local governments and non-profits.\n• The Senate and Assembly have also allocated $110.6 million from the $1.1 billion State and Municipal Project Fund, which is similar to the since-discontinued member item program.\n• Cuomo and state lawmakers are sitting on $67.3 million in unspent member items, according to the state budget division.
