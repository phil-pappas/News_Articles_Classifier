By Savannah Morning News Two arrests were made in a pair of weekend shootings.\nIn the first shooting, Savannah-Chatham police Violent Crimes detectives on Sunday morning arrested and charged Daquan Bryant, 17, in a Saturday night shooting on the 500 block of Yamacraw Village. That shooting injured a 20-year-old California man, according to police spokeswoman Eunicia Baker.\nThe shooting was reported just after 11 p.m.\nMetro officers responded to the scene and found the victim suffering from a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, Baker said. The man was transported by ambulance to Memorial University Medical Center for care.\nThe victim and an 18-year-old friend were together on River Street where they encountered a group of individuals. The two reportedly accepted an invitation by the group to accompany them to Yamacraw Village. Once they arrived at the 500 block of Yamacraw Village, a male suspect produced a gun and demanded the pair’s belongings, Baker said. The men ran away. The 20-year-old was shot while attempting to flee.\nNearby metro officers noticed several males, including Bryant, running west over the Bay Street viaduct. Officers stopped\nand detained the men for identification. They were transported to police headquarters for interviews, Baker said. Investigators determined that Bryant was the shooter. Bryant was charged with two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of armed robbery. He was transported to the Chatham County jail.\nTwo persons of interest also are sought for questioning in this investigation. Both are black males, possibly in their teens, Baker said. The first is described as tall, with a light complexion. During the incident he wore a red hooded sweatshirt. The second subject is described as short with a dark skin tone, possibly wearing a blue and red striped shirt during the incident.\nIn the second weekend shooting, Savannah-Chatham police Violent Crimes detectives arrested and charged Darius Javon Black, 23, in the attempted robbery of three men that resulted in a shooting on Abercorn and East Bryan streets at about 3:12 a.m. Sunday.\nPolice responded to the scene, where two men, a 21-year-old and a 22-year-old, were subduing a male subject, later identified as Black, said police spokeswoman Eunicia Baker. A second suspect fled the area. Black attempted to run when a Downtown Precinct patrol officer followed him. Black and the officer made contact nearby, Baker said. They engaged in a brief scuffle before Black was detained by the officer. The officer sustained minor injuries, Baker said.\nAdditional metro units at Abercorn and East Bryan streets located a 23-year-old man suffering from a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. The victim was transported by ambulance to Memorial University Medical Center for treatment, Baker said.\nInvestigators learned that all three men were robbed by Black and another male suspect after leaving a nearby club. The second suspect reportedly displayed a gun as both suspects demanded the group’s belongings. The group refused, resulting in a fight between themselves and the suspects, Baker said. During the fight, Black allegedly obtained the gun and fired, hitting the 23-year-old. The 21-year-old also was transported to Memorial with non-life-threatening injuries from the fight, Baker said.\nBlack was arrested and charged with two counts of aggravated assault, felony obstruction and obstruction by fleeing.\nInvestigators now seek a second suspect described as a heavy-set black male.\nAnyone with information on either of these cases should call CrimeStoppers at 912-234-2020 or text CRIMES (274637) using the keyword CSTOP2020.
