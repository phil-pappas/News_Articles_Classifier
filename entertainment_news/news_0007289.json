Quite often from people who have never been there. They make a lot of assumptions.\nPaul Theroux has been there, at least. In Deep South , his 11th travel book, the veteran travel writer and novelist spends more than a year exploring the Deep South — Alabama, Mississippi and parts of Georgia and Arkansas — on a peripatetic road trip that takes him to the places between places, the small towns and backwaters often overlooked. He meets preachers, barbers, pawnshop owners and eccentrics who could be found only in the South.\nKnown for epic travelogues ( The Great Railway Bazaar ) and award-winning fiction ( The Mosquito Coast ), Theroux is a fine writer who prides himself on his fearless forays into the underbelly of a place, his unflinching eye for detail and his ability to talk to anyone. He has lived in, visited and written about exotic locales from Africa to Asia. Now in his 70s, based in Cape Cod and Honolulu, he realized one of the few places he had left unexplored was the American South.\nTheroux’s worldliness both informs and beleaguers these 450-odd pages of travelogue. His storytelling is brightest in narrative scenes throbbing with local color. However, the momentum stalls with diversionary lectures (See: seven pages of dogging other travel writers; a 12-page rumination on the N-word) and other reminders of the author’s intellectual and geographic prowess.\nHe is endlessly comparing parts of the South to Third World countries. In Greensboro, Ala., a small town about an hour from the biggest university in the state, a woman mentions that her son does volunteer community development work in Africa, where Theroux has lived and traveled. “Suppressing a mocking laugh,” he writes, “I remarked to her that parts of Greensboro … bore a distinct resemblance to places in Zambia I had seen.”\nTheroux travels with a baggage of assumptions that often dictate his itinerary: the recurring themes of poverty, racism and a post-Civil-War “prevailing mood of bitter defeat” (because “conquered people feel helpless”) steer him almost exclusively to impoverished rural towns and disenfranchised people. He gravitates to regional stereotypes and phenomena that, while not inaccurate, do not represent the norm. (See: snake handlers, gun shows and church bombings — all mentioned on the very first page.)\nFew of his characters are young, educated or live in cities. Many of them speak phonetically — “Kin I he’p you in inny way?”— except for the ones who share his views; they speak with proper spelling.\nWhile he does a fine job sussing out local color, some of his interactions seem disingenuous. He introduces himself as “a Yankee” and “a stranger,” asks probing questions about race, then marvels when people react with distrust. He frequents gun shows (not one, but several), where he baits vendors by seeing if they’ll sell a handgun to a man from out of state (that’s illegal; they don’t). To a black pastor, he Quote: s Chaucer: “Palmers for to seken straunge strondes.” When the man smiles at him like he’s speaking Croatian, it seems to reinforce Theroux’s assumption that Southerners are illiterate.\nIt’s hard to get past all this to appreciate his writing, which is most beautiful when describing his own backyard, where “The knifing wind had whittled the snow into beautiful contours, like sculptural drapes.” If only he had applied his gifts to describing our drapes of kudzu, the singular flavor of muscadine grapes, the roots (and growing relevance) of Southern foodways or the unexpected mingling of races at Gip’s Place, an authentic juke joint in Bessemer, Ala.\nInstead, he belittles points of pride in a region accustomed to being treated like America’s armpit, comparing Crimson Tide football fanhood to “Islam in its most jihadi form” and poking fun at Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant’s “funny” hat. He dismisses To Kill a Mockingbird as “tediously plotty, overwritten and predictable.” He orders his catfish grilled .\nTo his credit, Theroux is conscious of his “prissy Yankee sanctimony” and his tendency toward the “reductiveness and dissonance and smirking self-regard in the breezing through” of his travels. He makes a concerted effort, returning in all four seasons, to understand a complicated region. And he does find some real gems — Pie Lab, a studio/restaurant that gathers people to share ideas over pie in Greensboro, Ala., Doe’s Eat Place, a storied steakhouse in Greenville, Miss. — that capture both ends of the Southern spectrum.\nAfter visiting black churches that embrace a white Yankee with genuine warmth, he concludes that the church is “the beating heart — the vitality, the hope — of a Southern community.” Amen to that.\nBut that doesn’t make up for dismissing the South’s rich literature and storytelling tradition as “a crock and self-serving.” Theroux is extremely well-read, as he reminds the reader with exhaustive (and exhausting) literary allusions and an entire chapter riffing on “The Paradoxes of Faulkner” (though he misspells Absalom! Absalom! ). He concludes there is “not enough writing” in the South, and what exists, “with a few exceptions, is insufficient.”\nPerhaps it is true, what Theroux says of Southerners’ “keen awareness of themselves as stereotypes — provincials and yokels, in literature, in life.” It’s hard not to be, when reading a book that reflects your reality like a funhouse mirror at the county fair. Deep South feels like that, too: a journey of self-fulfilling assumptions that results in a distorted portrait of a place that is much more diverse — and far more hopeful — than this book conveys. It may leave some readers, like my snarky Zion friend, feeling smugly validated in their assumptions.\nKim Cross is the author of “What Stands in a Storm,” a literary nonfiction account of the biggest tornado outbreak on record.
