Bob Branco will present his Somali pirate thriller as part of the Friends of the Library Speaker Series Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 7 p.m. at Waldoboro Public Library, 958 Main St./Route 220. He will discuss his 25-year career in the Navy and his book “Strike From the Deep,” about Somali pirates who threaten world shipping. \nIn his fictional thriller taken from today's headlines, Branco tells a story about special interests helping the pirates in a way that could return us to the days of the Cold War. “Strike From The Deep” is about the high-stakes game of counter-piracy operations, the U.S. Navy and coalition naval forces versus pirate skiffs, mother ships and a ruthless conspiracy that threatens to upset the world’s energy markets. \nThe novel is a tale of how the Navy works, how a ship operates at sea and how a captain and crew can singlehandedly make a positive difference in the fight against piracy. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Branco served in Navy destroyers and fleet operations staffs all over the world. He retired in 1991 after working to plan the first Gulf War while on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He served as Commanding Officer of USS Molala (ATF-106) in Vietnam in 1972 and of USS Charles F. Adams DDG-2 in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War in 1985. His naval service took him to 42 countries around the globe. \nThe public is welcome to this free program. Books will be available for purchase and signing, cash or check only. For more information, call the library at 832-4484 or visit waldoborolibrary.org . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
