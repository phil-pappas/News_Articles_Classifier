The two men enable the worst in each other, but also find some fellowship and redemption in the relationship, as they make their way from Dubuque, Iowa, to New Orleans on a misguided, haphazard road trip.\nRyan Reynolds’ best roles are the ones that play on his inherently smarmy qualities, and the sketchy Curtis offers up the chance for Reynolds to excel. Curtis’ accent travels up and down the Eastern Seaboard, but this isn’t a failure of performance on Reynolds’ part. In fact, it’s a slyly clever bit of character building. Curtis isn’t from anywhere, and he’s playing at being a well-traveled, down-on-his-luck cad.\nReynolds and Mendelsohn could not be more different as actors, but in this pairing, they are perfect. Their relationship is almost sweet. They look out for each other while simultaneously throwing each other under the bus. The two are extremely selfish addicts who torpedo every relationship they have — particularly with women — but they somehow keep getting back together, usually at a bar to order a bourbon. It’s plainly obvious the endless tall tales Curtis spins are bull, but he finds the perfect sidekick in Gerry, who has been hardened by life, but remains gullible, almost naive. He’s a dreamer, and Curtis is, too. In each other, they see themselves. For Curtis, Gerry’s shifty existence is an ominous warning sign. For Gerry, his younger pal embodies the kind of sexy, dangerous adventure he thinks this life could be.\nThere are many allusions to “The Wizard of Oz” in “Mississippi Grind”: The men talk of rainbows. Gerry’s estranged wife is named Dorothy. They bet on Toto’s Revenge at the racetrack. It’s as if the Scarecrow and the Tin Man got lost and wandered down the Mississippi River, drinking and gambling and stumbling into and out of various troubles, not worrying about their brains or their hearts, wishing for just a little bit of luck.\nMendelsohn is a heartbreaker in this role. He ranges from insecure loser to wild-eyed mania when the betting bug gets him. There are times when you want to grab him and shake him as he takes bigger and bigger risks, falling harder and harder. The picture rends your soul, as we desperately want and hope for Curtis and Gerry to make the right choices and they repeatedly do not. At the end of their journey, much like Dorothy’s trip to Oz, at least one of them finds that there’s no place like home, for better or for worse.\n‘Mississippi Grind’\nThree stars\nout of four stars\nRated R; language\n1 hour, 48 minutes\nOpens Friday at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:25:46.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
