No word on if Melissa McCarthy will come back as Sookie St. James.\n\"Gilmore Girls\" was originally on the WB before it moved to the CW for its final season, and series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino left before the show was over. She once admitted that the series did not end the way she had envisioned it; she famously planned the show's ending with four unrevealed words, but didn't the chance to conclude \"Gilmore Girls\" on her own terms.\nNow, Palladino will have her chance.

Ten years later, there's still going to be [material] there to mine and to delve into.\"\nFans shouldn't worry that the reboot will ruin the show's legacy. In the summer, Palladino vowed, \"If it ever happened, I promise we'll do it correctly.\"", "external_links": ["http://tvline.com/2015/10/19/gilmore-girls-revival-netflix-new-episodes/"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:36:33.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
