(AP) — Twentieth Century Fox officials say they have found no evidence actors took American Indian artifacts while filming \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" at a private New Mexico ranch. \nChris Petrikin, a spokesman for 20th Century Fox, told The Associated Press the studio and the Scorch Trials production apologizes for previous statements suggesting items were taken. \nActor Dylan O'Brien said last month on \"Live with Kelly and Michael\" that cast members took artifacts from private ranch north of Albuquerque, despite warnings not to take any items like rocks or skulls. \nThe 24-year-old O'Brien didn't say what was taken. \nBut Petrikin says the studio has determined no artifacts were removed from Diamond Tail Ranch just south of San Felipe Pueblo. \nAn O'Brien representative did not immediately return an email from The Associated Press. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:08:01.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
