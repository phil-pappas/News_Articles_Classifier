In \"Hell in Syria /Foreign Policy Breakdown in America,\" author and analyst Anne R. Pierce shows how U.S. Syria policy facilitated Russian and Iranian incursions, and contributed to the escalation and radicalization of the conflict. Excerpts from Pierce's article in The Washington Times and a link are below. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/5/anne-r-pierce-hell-syriaforeign-policy-breakdown-a/ \nPierce writes: \"The cataclysmic war in Syria , and the catastrophic refugee crisis, are underlain by the moral and strategic deficits of American foreign policy. Of course, the brutal and bloodthirsty Assad regime and brutal and bloodthirsty terrorists bear the primary blame. But, the American response has enabled bad actors, and made the situation worse.\n\"Ruinous violence and extreme atrocities, resulting in four million fleeing Syria , constitute one of the worst humanitarian disasters the world has ever seen. Dire geopolitical and human consequences are compounded by Iranian and Russian intrusions and radical-Islamist advances. With a sea of humanity massacred, brutalized, displaced, traumatized or radicalized, we must face the faults in our policy, so that better policy can be found.\"\nFor more, visit: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/5/anne-r-pierce-hell-syriaforeign-policy-breakdown-a/ \n \n\nSOURCE Anne R.
