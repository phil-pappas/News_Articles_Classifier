The images also, according to the letter, infringe on Bieber's trademarks. \nThe singer's representatives at the Myman Greenspan law firm are threatening to sue if the photographs aren't taken down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:18:54.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
