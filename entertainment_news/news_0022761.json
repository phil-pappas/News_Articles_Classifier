An image of him would be an exceptionally rare and valuable find, but would require a meticulous process of verification.\nRELATED: Lost photo of Jesse James, assassin Robert Ford is found\nHPD's forensic artist, Lois Gibson , spent a month analyzing facial features of the men in the photo. And last week, a genealogist traced the family of the photo's owner back to the James' community in 19th Century Missouri. But even that is only the start.\nTake, for example, a photo of Billy the Kid—another famed Western bandit— verified Tuesday and expected to sell for millions . Investigators spent more than a year researching the photo, even locating the building pictured in the background and excavating its remains. The process and discovery were notable enough to merit a National Geographic documentary, scheduled to air this month.\nThe purported Jesse James photo belonged to Sandy Mills, a rural Washingtonian who said she inherited it from her grandmother, who inherited it from her grandmother, who used to tell stories about harboring the infamous outlaw gang in their Missouri farmhouse. Mills sent the photo to Gibson, a Guinness award-winning facial expert, who said in September she was sure it was James. But not everyone agreed.\nEric James, a self-described descendant of the bandit family and a prominent Jesse James blogger, published a scathing rebuttal , calling Gibson a \"liar,\" \"con-artist\" and a \"fraud.\" He said Mills had previously offered the image to him for verification, but that he deemed it \"blatantly false.\"\n\"No evidence exists that Lois Gibson performed any scientific authentication of image assessment, or that she in qualified to do so,\" he wrote, passing off Gibson's eight pages of analytic illustrations as fraudulent comparisons to fake images of Jesse James.\nHe posted his article via Facebook with Freda Cruse Hardison , 58, a respected historian of the Ozark Region in Arkansas and Missouri. He didn't know that Hardison, who holds a PhD from the University of California, was preparing to publish her new historical novel: \"Frank and Jesse James Friends and Family,\" which details the extended community of the famed outlaw brothers.\nSo when Hardison learned of the emerging controversy over an image of the Western legend, she figured she could weigh in easily. She'd already spent the last decade assembling a 50,000-person family tree for historical residents of Arkansas and Missouri. She contacted Gibson, plugged in some names and made a discovery.\nMills' great-great-grandmother, Pauline Roundtree, was indeed linked closely to Jesse James—she was the first cousin, once-removed, of Jesse's sister-in-law, Annie Ralston. For 19th Century towns of the Midwestern frontier, Hardison said, that's a tight connection, and means they plausibly lived nearby.\n\"It's not hard for me to believe at all that Pauline Roundtree would have been a part of all of that extended family and extended community of the James brothers,\" said Hardison, who's been cited as an expert on the Travel Chanel's \"America Declassified\" and in Oxford American Magazine.\nIt was Jesse James legends like the one Mills' grandma told that inspired Hardison to the topic of her book—stories she heard through years of regional research, about the time when grandpa fed the James brothers, when grandma gave them horses or when the outlaws sought refuge in a local cave. Hardison assumed they were tall tales.\nRELATED: New 'Billy the Kid' photo real, says Lois Gibson\nThrough investigation, she uncovered records of a great web of community relationships that kept the James brothers safe from the law during their years of banditry. When many local legends proved to be true, Hardison asked why people never told them before. They had, they'd tell her, but no one believed them.\nEric James, reached by email, said Hardison's research was \"a hoax.\"\nIt's almost impossible to know for sure. Establishing a family link doesn't prove that's Jesse James in the photo. And there are no national standards for consistency and validation in most forensic sciences, including facial recognition, according to a 2009 report by the National Academy of Science , so Gibson could only present a compelling case, not conclusive evidence.\nThat's why T.J. Stiles , a leading biographer of Jesse James, said he sticks with photographs verified at the time, like a portrait of James in the Missouri State Archives that was signed by his widow.\n\"We have to assume that he did not have many photographs taken of himself, and that only those closest to him ever got their hands on one,\" he said. \"But we want so much to find that hidden treasure, that rare photograph of the eternal fugitive.\"", "external_links": ["http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589", "http://ericjames.org/wordpress/2015/10/02/lost-jesse-james-bob-ford-photos-not-lost-not-authenticated/", "http://www.folklib.net/ar/mountain_view_ar.shtml#Books", "http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2009/nov/26/stone-county-forgotten-past-20091126/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6769626/", "http://www.tjstiles.net/", "http://www.chron.com/houston/article/Billy-the-Kid-photo-real-Houston-forensic-artist-5757088.php", "http://www.loisgibson.com/", "http://www.chron.com/national/article/Lost-photo-of-Jesse-James-assassin-Robert-Ford-6540749.php"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:55:36.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
