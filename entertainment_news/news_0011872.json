Trailing 24-7 as the fourth quarter started, Dalton threw for a touchdown, ran for another and led the Bengals (5-0) on a 69-yard drive without a timeout. Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation. Nugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter. The Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl. Seattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:47:19.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
