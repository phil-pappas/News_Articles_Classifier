Throughout the project, Wap shows his love for trap, trapping, his crew Remy Boyz, and his love for women. In \"Time,\" a sure romantic favorite, Wap croons with passion, asking a lady if she has \"some time to spare.\" \"Boomin\" goes hard as he yells, \"Boomin down yah block, Fetty Wap!\"\nWap switches like this throughout. One moment the bravado demands your attention, and the next he's showing a soft, almost boyish side of himself.\nOn \"RGF Island,\" he declares: \"There's gon' be a house party on this island!\" And that's exactly what this album is: songs for red cups raised to the roof. A few tracks bleed into the next ones, but the standouts make up for the merging.\nCongratulations: You just found the sound track for your next house party.\n-- Sofiya Ballin\nJanet Jackson\n\"Unbreakable\"\n(Rhythm Nation/BMG 1/2)\nJackson family sister Janet has worked too hard to get where she is -- establishing her own right as a superstar; brooking the controversies surrounding a talented but troubled family; earning platinum smashes like \"Control\" -- to let a few bumps in the road stop her. She has some bum records, to be sure. And these days, her brouhaha with CBS censors over her Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime wardrobe malfunction looks stupid in the face of what Miley Cyrus wears regularly. Face it: Janet Jackson hasn't always had it easy.\nNow, she presents \"Unbreakable,\" with co-pilots/producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. There are heavenly, breathily over-processed tremblers such as \"Night,\" \"The Great Forever,\" and \"No Sleep.\" The last one, a percussive cut with rapper J. Cole, is exquisitely sensual rather than gaudily sexual (no Madonna-like spanking for Janet).\nThe sound is somewhat dated, especially on \"2 B Loved\" or such moments as when gruff guest rapper Missy Elliott comes to play on the speedy \"Burnitup!\" Yet that oxygenated sound is a gorgeous frame for lush slow tunes like the title track, where Janet employs brother Michael's quivering vocal delivery as she sings, \"I lived through my mistakes, it's just a part of growing\" through arching, dynamic harmonies.\n-- A.D. Amorosi\nGeorge Strait\n\"Cold Beer Conversation\"\n(MCA Nashville )\nPart of the enduring appeal of George Strait is that the country superstar seems like a guy you'd like to have a cold-beer conversation with -- a man's man who isn't afraid to show his feelings, but also a rock-steady presence you can lean on as well as have a good time with.\nAfter three and a half decades, the steadfast Texan shows no inclination to change his musical approach, and why should he? \"Cold Beer Conversation\" is another on-the-money mix of sober and stirring ballads, midtempo numbers such as \"It Was Love\" and \"Everything I See,\" and party-ready honky-tonkers, including \"Goin' Goin' Gone\" and \"Cheaper Than a Shrink\" (\" ... you just pour and drink\").\nWith \"It Takes All Kinds,\" Strait also delivers his requisite track of western swing while delivering a message of tolerance and a subtle reminder that he's quite happy in his own niche: \"You keep doing your thing/ I'm doing mine right now.\"\n-- Nick Cristiano\nFOR SALE FRIDAY\nThe Game, \"The Documentary 2\"; Selena Gomez, \"Revival\"; Toby Keith, \"35 MPH Town\"; St. Germain, \"Real Blues\"\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1732937&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1732937&h=New+albums%3A+Fetty+Wap%3B+Janet+Jackson%3B+George+Strait", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1732937"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:32:57.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
