Delta Goodrem tops Maxim’s hot 100 list. Picture: Getty \nDELTA Goodrem has been named the hottest woman in Australia, posing in her sexiest photo shoot yet. \nThe 30-year-old singer graces the cover of Maxim’s annual Hot 100 issue, beating Hollywod A-lister Margot Robbie for the top spot. \nWhile Goodrem has been gradually showing her sexier side with her ensembles on The Voice, she’s clearly shaken off any remaining inhibitions with the steamy cover shoot. \nSporting wet hair and a smouldering glare, the starlet is tastefully covered up by the edge of a glistening pool. \n“I feel most comfortable in my body now than I ever have. I feel sexier,” she told Who Magazine in July. Super excited to be Number #1 on Maxim's prestigious hot 100 thank you so much guys!  #honored #girlpower xo pic.twitter.com/h4O5RTGpQ9 — Delta Goodrem (@DeltaGoodrem) October 21, 2015 \nGoodrem has come a long way since her breakthrough on Neighbours, recently nabbing her ninth No. 1 single with Wings.
