Defenseman Adam Clendening, 22, replaced Rob Scuderi, 36, for that game. Clendening played 13:16, was plus-1 and took two minor penalties. That’s not the stuff Doug Harvey was made of, but the Penguins won. \nYet, Saturday versus Toronto, Scuderi was back in. In the Penguins’ first three games, Scuderi was minus-1 and on the ice for three power-play goals against. \nThe Penguins beat Toronto, 2-1. Scuderi was plus-1. But Johnston’s decision went against conventional coaching wisdom. \nClendening won’t make the Penguins’ season. Scuderi won’t break the Penguins’ season. Probably not, anyway. \nBut going back to Scuderi after winning with Clendening is symptomatic of the Penguins’ strong preference for older players, an inclination that dates back to the Ray Shero/Dan Bylsma administration. Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. \nThen-GM Shero dug a hole for the Penguins in the summer of 2013 when he retained wingers Pascal Dupuis and Chris Kunitz and signed free-agent defenseman Rob Scuderi. Dupuis and Scuderi got four-year contracts, Kunitz three. All were 34. \nYou can’t sign three 34-year-olds to long-term contracts at the same time, especially two who play the same position. The Penguins committed $40 million to exactly the kind of players you need to let come and go in a capped league. \nBut, within the context of organizational predilections, those deals suited the Penguins fine. Still do. The Penguins don’t trust youth. \nConsider 18-year-old rookie winger Daniel Sprong. He’s got speed, energy and a sweet release that netted his first NHL goal Thursday. \nBut, until injury necessitated, Sprong played a fourth-line role even though his skill set dictates the opposite. By the terms of collective bargaining, Sprong can play nine NHL games before his entry-level contract kicks in. At that point, the Penguins must keep Sprong or return him to Major Junior hockey. \nDemoting Sprong would be crazy. Dupuis and Beau Bennett are hurt, as is their wont. No date is set for free-agent signing Eric Fehr’s return after off-season elbow surgery. The wingers have just three goals in five games, including one by Sprong. Patric Hornqvist, Chris Kunitz and David Perron have none despite playing top-six roles. \nSprong is dynamic, enthusiastic, mature and a constant threat. But it’s no better than 50-50 that he stays past the nine-game deadline. \nIf Sprong returns to Major Junior, he must stay there all season. What if a top-six winger gets hurt? Who jumps up the depth chart? The Penguins don’t have a single legit scoring threat playing with their Wilkes-Barre/Scranton affiliate. \nJohnston referred to Sprong as “a junior player” after Thursday’s game. How would Johnston like to be referred to as “a junior coach”? He’s not far removed. \nLast year, Tampa Bay barged to the Stanley Cup Final with three second-year forwards finishing second, third and fourth among the team’s scorers: Tyler Johnson, Nikita Kucherov and Ondrej Palat. All younger than 25. No first-round picks. \nExperience is nice. But you can trust youth, too. Trust talent. Trust energy. The Penguins deny themselves the electricity brought by young, hungry players who feel a legit part of things. That’s been minimal for a long time. \nDistrust of youth manifests itself all over the lineup: Matt Cullen, 38, is a serviceable fourth-liner. But why not Oskar Sundqvist, 21? How’d he go from almost making the Penguins last year to the pay-no-mind list this year? How did 29-year-old journeyman Kevin Porter jump ahead of Sundqvist? Olli Maatta, 21, was considered one of the Penguins’ top two defensemen entering the season. But he’s averaging less ice time than every defenseman but Brian Dumoulin. Even Scuderi plays more. Maatta has struggled? Let him play through it, like you would a veteran. Maatta doesn’t kill penalties? Use him to kill penalties. Derrick Pouliot, 21, plays the attack-minded style of defense preferred by Johnston. His tools fit. Pouliot is also adept at quarterbacking the power play. But he’s at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. Pouliot had a bad camp. But so did several veterans. Ability should earn benefit of the doubt occasionally. Not just gray hair. \nJohnston and GM Jim Rutherford need to assemble their roster and depth chart based on what is, not on what was or on how they want things to be. Stop recycling. Fresh meat instead of old bones. The method fancied shows no sign of working. \nMark Madden hosts a radio show 3-6 p.m. weekdays on WXDX-FM (105.9).
