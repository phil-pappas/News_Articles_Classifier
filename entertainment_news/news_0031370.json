Total membership has been on the decline for years. Wage growth has stalled. Benefit plans have moved to higher deductibles, and worker hours have become more unpredictable in some cases.\nLast year, about one in 10 wage or salary workers belonged to a union, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1983, the figure was one in five.\nThere are about 200 union groups with about 100,000 members in the 11-county Rochester-Genesee Valley Area Labor Federation, covering Rochester and a large area heading south to Pennsylvania.\nEnter UAW Local 1097 president Dan Maloney, elected last month to steer the labor federation for the retiring Jim Bertolone, who also left his post as head of the Rochester Labor Council. Bruce Popper takes over for Bertolone on the local council.\nMaloney sees progress and some hope, even in the face of dwindling numbers and attempts to cut unions' financial lifelines.\nDan Maloney (Photo: Provided)\n“We have been energized by this Occupy Wall Street movement,” Maloney said. “We are seeing a lot of youngsters and college kids — workers in their 20s and 30s — energized by this movement, taking part in these rallies and learning that you can fight back against corporate greed and corporate power and win.”\nIt got the attention of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who led efforts to get the minimum wage raised to $15 for fast-food workers and is looking at ways to widen it to include all workers — a union-supported idea — despite stiff opposition from business-related interests. The Business Council of New York State earlier this week said the measure would cost the private sector $15.7 billion a year.\nMany other pro-business groups also have opposed the increase, fearing it will force companies to raise prices while cutting hours and jobs for both union and nonunion members.\n\"It is really scary stuff,\" said Greg Biryla, executive director of Rochester-based business advocacy group Unshackle Upstate. \"I understand that unions are supporting this and that it may help their numbers, but I would argue that it hurts everybody working in our community. (It) will have a negative effect on all community members, all taxpayers, all consumers and many employees, including union employees. (Businesses) get very worried and they believe there will be job losses.\"\nStill, efforts to organize have risen from the Fight for $15 push, which brought longstanding union cries of economic justice and solidarity back into the mainstream, though it did alienate some workers in other industries who currently aren't scheduled to get such a boost but may possess more skills.\n“One of the things we need to do with this population is raise their expectations,” said Popper, president of the 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers. “Why do people buy into the rhetoric of, ‘Oh, I am tired of paying taxes for my teachers to have a pension.’ Well, fool, you should want to have a pension. What are you, kidding? Everybody in retirement should be secure.”\nHead of the house\nMaloney took over as president of the local United Auto Workers about nine years ago after General Motors spinoff Delphi Corp. went bankrupt. That move put worker pensions in jeopardy. Wages were cut. Many workers left or were forced out.\nUnion negotiators helped soften the blow, he said. Lump-sum payments were offered to workers, some of whom took pay cuts of $5 and $10 an hour, to pay off debt. Early retirement packages helped protect benefits.\n“The ones that could have retired under the existing conditions could have seen a drastic reduction in the pension monies (owed) to them, and a loss of post-retirement medical benefits,” Maloney said.\nAbout 1,000 people left, including some of the local UAW’s leadership. More than 900 new people came in, said Maloney, who has been re-elected as the group’s president ever since.\nHis challenge will be trying to keep all the different groups focused.\n“We need to stay together on the big issues because that’s the only way you can build power,” Bertolone said. “It’s in solidarity, that’s where our power comes from. Management doesn’t listen to me because they are afraid of me or think I am so smart. They listen to me because I speak for over 1,000 employees, and those employees elect me as their spokesperson.”\nBuy Photo Labor Day marchers Juliana Shattuck, 6, and Chris McCamic show support for the Fight for $15 movement in Rochester.

Where does the company want to be in 10 years? What kind of products?\" Serravallo said. \"If they could be brought into that kind of discussion, that would be far more beneficial. (But) it is not in the nature of an employer to share that kind of decision-making with its workers.\"\nUnion numbers\nAccording to some research, unions appear to have been successful in negotiating for higher wages.\nThe Labor Council for Latin American Advancement said recently that Latino workers in unions earn about $5.60 more an hour, or about $11,500 a year, than their nonunion counterparts.\nThere are similar reported wage differences for all union and nonunion workers, too.\nThose in unions last year made about $970 a week, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonunion members, on average, took home about $760 in pay.\nIn a fast-growing profession, such as registered nursing, the average hourly pay here is below national averages and is about $3.50 less an hour compared to Buffalo, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Popper said it's because more nurses are organized in the Buffalo area.\n“You’re talking that Rochester is on par with an average that includes Mississippi and Alabama, the open-shop states,” said Popper, who represents about 2,200 members in Monroe County. “It’s just unbelievable.\"\nBruce Popper (Photo: File)\nEmployers in Rochester have long defended their pay practices for such nurses. For instance, UR Medicine's Strong Memorial Hospital said its average hourly wage for registered nurses is $33.22, slightly higher than the average in Buffalo.\n\"We currently have about 30 nurses at Strong who commute from Buffalo because our compensation is competitive and they enjoy our overall professional work environment, \" said Christopher DiFrancesco, hospital spokesman.\nIn Cuomo’s efforts to increase the minimum wage, he frequently pointed out the $700 million it costs taxpayers annually in public assistance to help low-wage fast-food workers, claiming that they are twice as likely to need the help.\n“The working poor should have wages that would keep them off of social services,” Maloney said. “There should be dignity in the workplace. We subsidize those workers. They are getting food stamps, subsidized housing, Healthy NY health care. It’s a bad business model, and it is not right.”\nUnions also provide job and safety training and work to ensure that members receive due process in disciplinary hearings and other matters. Some provide funds to members for child care services.\nMaloney said the local UAW also represents workers outside of Rochester at firms in Yates, Cortland and Onondaga counties.\n“We’ve done nothing but improve the lives of our members,” Maloney said. “Without a union, though, this last round of bankruptcies and the downturn in the economy would have been (uglier).\"\nHowever, the tactics by some unions have been questioned over the years. Locked in negotiations with Teamsters Local 118, Wegmans Food Markets blamed the Teamsters for flying an airplane banner during a Buffalo Bills game that read: \"Wegmans wants Buffalo to lose.\"\nAnother attack on Wegmans by United Food and Commercial Workers said the grocer has an \"anti-worker\" record and \"a history of making empty promises,\" according to its GoodJobsBrooklyn.com campaign.\nWegmans vehemently denied both claims and called the claims inaccurate while pointing to the numerous rankings for how it treats employees, its corporate reputation and as one of the best supermarkets in the nation.\n\"Organized labor has pretty vast resources and they have proven over time to be willing to use those resources in a myriad of ways to get their message out,\" Biryla said.\nBuy Photo Workers march through Rochester in support of a $15 minimum wage. (Photo: CARLOS ORTIZ/@CFOrtiz_DandC/2015 Staff file photo)\nThe ‘other’ threat\nLocal union leaders are keeping an eye on a Supreme Court case that could drastically change how union dues are paid across the country.\nThe court has agreed to hear Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which challenges the way union dues and fees are collected by public teachers even as they disagree with many of the union’s policies.\nThe case joins a growing list of efforts along the lines of the National Right to Work Act, a proposal allowing workers to decide if they want to financially support a union, working against unions.\nPopper called those efforts “a very smart targeted hit on the financial base on the labor movement nationwide.” Bertolone said the case could end up putting more pressure on dues-paying union members.\nMaloney added it should have unions looking for new ways to grow stronger.\nHe still believes in furthering manufacturing, which can create a pipeline of new jobs but has been largely on the decline across the state, but also wants to see other efforts to protect union interests.\n\"What we do — right, wrong or indifferent — is we have an endorsement process and we get behind ‘labor-friendly’ candidates,\" he said. \"I would like to see a push to ensure that labor runs for and wins these offices ... city council seats, town board and county legislature seats. Hopefully we get a better quality to choose from.\"\nBut those ideas are only subplots to the greater issue of increasing union membership.\n\"You got to organize, that is the lifeblood of unions,\" he said. \"We have to keep it together and go back to basics, show them that there is strength in solidarity. It is going to be my job to kind of steer a vision for the Rochester Area Federation, so again there will be unity and increase political action.\"\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com\nLabor changes\nBuy Photo Jim Bertolone (Photo: File photo)\nJim Bertolone, 64, will continue to serve as president of American Postal Workers Union Local 215, although he has resigned from the top positions at the Rochester-Genesee Valley Area Labor Federation and the Rochester Labor Council.\n\"You get old,\" Berolone said. \"What are you going to do?\"\nHe became president of the postal workers in the early 1990s, and leader of the larger labor federations after a re-organizing effort several years later. Bertolone was a member of the state's AFL-CIO Workforce Development Board, helping to funnel $4 million in training grants and $2 million to middle-class families in the Rochester area for child care costs.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/60354436a34418d0ec85cfcd05f877e527de4294/c=5-0-326-428&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798311596460957-ROCBrd-09-07-2015-DandC-1-A021--2015-09-06-IMG-IMG-Bruce-Popper-1-1-2-1-5LBQR3J4-L670073215-IMG-IMG-Bruce-Popper-1-1-2-1-5LBQR3J4.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798309248333905-Dan-Maloney-UAW-Local-1097-photo-by-Bess-Watts.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798311596460957-ROCBrd-09-07-2015-DandC-1-A021--2015-09-06-IMG-IMG-Bruce-Popper-1-1-2-1-5LBQR3J4-L670073215-IMG-IMG-Bruce-Popper-1-1-2-1-5LBQR3J4.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798318274083762-ROCBrd-07-23-2015-DandC-1-A010--2015-07-22-IMG-CO-Wage-072215-A-Met-1-1-JPBE1IEM-L647536731-IMG-CO-Wage-072215-A-Met-1-1-JPBE1IEM.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/baced02933129c645f1c7bb12da932f36713832a/r=500x322/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798318274083762-ROCBrd-07-23-2015-DandC-1-A010--2015-07-22-IMG-CO-Wage-072215-A-Met-1-1-JPBE1IEM-L647536731-IMG-CO-Wage-072215-A-Met-1-1-JPBE1IEM.jpg", "https://nrtwc.org/FactSheets/Fact%20Sheet%20-%20National%20Right%20to%20Work%20Act%202015.pdf", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798318231183487-TY-090715-LABORDAY-PARADE-C.jpg", "http://goodjobsbrooklyn.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad27fa37e9f9d4abe9c34482f0040ff18c0e0a92/c=0-143-1411-2024&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798318231183487-TY-090715-LABORDAY-PARADE-C.jpg", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d90ee45acb2718e39d52a78cbeadff06385d0952/r=309x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798311596460957-ROCBrd-09-07-2015-DandC-1-A021--2015-09-06-IMG-IMG-Bruce-Popper-1-1-2-1-5LBQR3J4-L670073215-IMG-IMG-Bruce-Popper-1-1-2-1-5LBQR3J4.jpg", "http://lclaa.org/images/pdf/publications/Latino_Workers_and_Unions-A_Strategic_Partnership_for_Americas_Progress.pdf", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a91f52e65571c9980e0c09b7ce6f60fe66882b7/c=0-117-1208-1728&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798308083786440-ROCBrd-03-25-2015-DandC-1-A002--2015-03-24-IMG-IMG-bertolone-jim.j-2-1-AGAALUID-L585065004-IMG-IMG-bertolone-jim.j-2-1-AGAALUID.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d83dac3735b975be55a7f97f030517e308f4e217/r=220x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798309248333905-Dan-Maloney-UAW-Local-1097-photo-by-Bess-Watts.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/543e63b3ee1945b360cec54015613a7ac8610413/r=279x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798308083786440-ROCBrd-03-25-2015-DandC-1-A002--2015-03-24-IMG-IMG-bertolone-jim.j-2-1-AGAALUID-L585065004-IMG-IMG-bertolone-jim.j-2-1-AGAALUID.jpg", "https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-instructs-state-labor-department-convene-wage-board-investigate-and-make", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/751875aad86b17706437a21ac0178a8e0ca188bd/c=302-0-3969-2757&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798318274083762-ROCBrd-07-23-2015-DandC-1-A010--2015-07-22-IMG-CO-Wage-072215-A-Met-1-1-JPBE1IEM-L647536731-IMG-CO-Wage-072215-A-Met-1-1-JPBE1IEM.jpg", "http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/friedrichs-v-california-teachers-association/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb0e74ce74a6f17dee6c35e3a6bd0c9c7330e6e7/r=260x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798318231183487-TY-090715-LABORDAY-PARADE-C.jpg", "http://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/news-release/nursesoccupationalemploymentandwages_newyork.htm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798308083786440-ROCBrd-03-25-2015-DandC-1-A002--2015-03-24-IMG-IMG-bertolone-jim.j-2-1-AGAALUID-L585065004-IMG-IMG-bertolone-jim.j-2-1-AGAALUID.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aba571e0efdaec248ad8f4ae7b5762546b7c1560/c=0-84-526-786&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Rochester/Rochester/635798309248333905-Dan-Maloney-UAW-Local-1097-photo-by-Bess-Watts.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:04:40.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
