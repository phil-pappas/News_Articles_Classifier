Fuck that,\" she wrote. \"I don't think I've ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It's just heard.\"\nShe also said she found it offensive that one of the hacked Sony emails had referred to fellow movie star Angelina Jolie as a \"spoiled brat.\"\n\"For some reason, I just can't picture someone saying that about a man,\" she wrote.\nLawrence, who won an Oscar for her role in the 2012 comedy \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" is one of Hollywood's youngest stars at age 25.\nShe's also one of its highest earners, topping Forbes magazine's 2015 list of best-paid actresses at $52 million dollars.\nBut that's still nearly $30 million short of the $80 million raked in by Robert Downey Jr., who topped the list for the third consecutive year.\nArts & Entertainment Celebrities Jennifer Lawrence Hollywood Lena Dunham", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:22:55.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
