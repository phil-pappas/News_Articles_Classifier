San Diego-based Imprimis Pharmaceuticals said it would offer customized versions of its drugs for less than $1 a pill as an alternative to Daraprim.\nTuring Pharmaceuticals was indundated with criticism last month when it raised the price of Daraprim by more than 5,000%, from $13.50 a pill to $750. The Food and Drug Administration-approved Daraprim is used to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease that afflicts people with weakened immune systems, such as those with AIDS and pregnant women.\nInvestors applauded the move, driving Imprimis shares ( IMMY ) up 7% to $6.41 in early trading Friday.\nTo be sure, the FDA has not approved Imprimis’ compounded drug formulations as a recommended treatment for toxoplasmosis.\nBut doctors can prescribe the medications for individuals when they perceive it to be a viable alternative treatment.\nThe Imprimis oral capsules — which are customized formulations of its pyrimethamine and leucovorin treatments — will be offered starting at $99 for a 100-count bottle.\n“Recent generic drug price increases have made us concerned and caused us to take positive action to address an opportunity to help a needy patient population,” Imprimis CEO Mark L. Baum said in a statement. “While we respect Turing's right to charge patients and insurance companies whatever it believes is appropriate, there may be more cost-effective compounded options for medications, such as Daraprim, for patients, physicians, insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to consider.”\nA Turing spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/NathanBomey", "http://imprimispharma.investorroom.com/2015-10-22-Imprimis-Pharmaceuticals-to-Make-Compounded-and-Customizable-Formulation-of-Pyrimethamine-and-Leucovorin-Available-for-Physicians-to-Prescribe-for-their-Patients-as-an-Alternative-to-Daraprim"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:31.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
