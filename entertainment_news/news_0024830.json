I am going to give up my best to the people. Last year it couldn't happen. This year full vim. \n\"I am coming with all my crew,\" he promised. \nRepresenting Okuapeman Secondary, Tinny traded his school anthem for his new hit song which is making waves. \n\"I [have] forgotten the anthem,\" he said when he was challenged by host of Drive Time programme Lexis Bill to sing it. \nThe night was not without the powerful jama festival that normally ushers the main old skuul renion event. \nAnd on the night Atlantic Hall (ATL), Prempeh College and Royal Guardians from the University of Winneba were in euphoric mood, chanting the spirited jama hit tracks. \nATL took advantage of the opportunity to take a swipe at the Casfodians whilst Prempeh did same to Opokuware. \nOn Saturday the rivalry will be worse. It will be unlimited fun at the Independence Square.
