Rose, the first overall pick in 2008, is the guarded, stoic one who often is uncomfortable in group interview sessions.\nBut strip away that public posturing — and all the talk of whose team the 2015-16 Bulls will be — and similarities exist. Both Butler and Rose typically retreat to a cocoon of familiarity in the form of old, trusted friends, relatives and trainers. And both like to put in work.\nNeither player lacks for ability. Both are supremely confident.\n\"I know I'm great,\" Rose said on media day, the day before he fractured his left orbital bone, which will sideline him until at least Oct. 14.\nAs for Butler, he doubled down on his leadership stance after his impressive exhibition opener Tuesday night: \"When times get tough, we're down and not making shots or getting stops, I have to be that guy to get us together and make sure we're doing what we're supposed to be doing.\"\n\"Whose team is it?\" is a subplot to the larger, more important story of how well Rose and Butler play together in coach Fred Hoiberg's offense. The Bulls have plenty of leaders. Joakim Noah still hasn't turned down a primal scream opportunity. Pau Gasol is a gifted player and respected teammate with two NBA championships on his resume.\nButler, who never envisioned being in this role, said as much on media day.\n\"It's all of our team,\" Butler said. \"I can't do it all by myself. Derrick can't either. Neither can (Gasol or Noah). If we work together as a team, we just want one goal, and that's to win a championship. Everybody would be a winner then, not one person more than another. I don't think it's any one person's team. It's everybody's team.\"\nIt's also a team that should feature plenty of opportunities for Butler and Rose to shine together. For all the attention Rose's passive play drew in the season-ending loss to the Cavaliers in May, he and Butler both averaged over 20 points in the playoffs. The Bulls won 62.2 percent of their games when both were healthy.\nTheir skill sets can coexist, particularly in Hoiberg's more free-flowing offense.\n\"They complement each other beautifully,\" Hoiberg said.\nButler didn't love it when Rose said during last season's playoffs that the first-time All-Star hadn't yet reached superstar status, a source said. He also has made it a public point of pride to try to outwork his teammates, drawing on his offseason regimen with trainer Chris Johnson to set a leadership tone.\nIt hasn't gone unnoticed.\n\"The amount of work he puts in, even during two-a-days, he would still come in a third time,\" Hoiberg said. \"I mean the guy is unbelievable how much energy he has. He's just so dedicated to putting the right things in his body, his training and he wants to continue to add to his game every year.\"\nHoiberg even cited former teammate Kevin Garnett and — blasphemy warning — Michael Jordan as superstars whom teammates followed because of their work ethic and commitment.\n\"Jimmy wants that,\" Hoiberg said. \"He wants to assume that role with leadership, getting guys with him. He had Doug (McDermott) with him for a couple weeks in San Diego, working out with him. And that's a testament to what he wants to do as far as team goals, when you've got a guy that's one of the best players in the league that also works the hardest.\"\nRose is due to begin activity in less than a week. Butler said he thinks they can be the best backcourt in the league. There's a championship model in Golden State that might take exception, so it's time to prove it.\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Jimmy Butler Derrick Rose Fred Hoiberg Chicago Bulls Pau Gasol Joakim Noah Chris Johnson (basketball)", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615a3b1/turbine/ct-jimmy-butler-derrick-rose-bulls-spt-1008-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:03:59.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
