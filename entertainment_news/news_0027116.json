She writes down three things that she’s grateful for and she shares them with three friends.”\nWinfrey (inset), coming off 25 years of her own talk show, was at a professional low, she said, when at first her network, OWN, wasn’t turning a profit. “Belief” became an “ah-ha” moment for her.\n“Telling these kinds of stories is what I created a network to do so I thought regardless of what else, whatever demands are on my time, whatever else is going on, this is what I want to do,” she said.\nProducers Michael Davie and Eric Strauss, who spent three years flying around the world making the series, spoke about trusting the long and arduous process of making the show. Reshma Thakkar, who appears as one of the seekers in the first episode, told us she was startled to see her hands on a giant billboard for the show in Times Square.\nAmong those who mingled with a smiling Winfrey at a postscreening cocktail party below the screening room at the TimesCenter were Gayle King, Barbara Walters, Deepak Chopra, Common and Dr. Mehmet Oz.\nconfidential@nydailynews.com\nGot some hot gossip for us?\nTipline: 212-210-1616\nE-mail: confidential@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:32:16.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
