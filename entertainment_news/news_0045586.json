The official release event will be held on Friday, 16th October at Galatos and will feature live performances by Parabola West with special guests Katie Thompson and David Frasen. The video for Fire will also be screened - here is a sneak peek! \nOriginally hailing from the United States, Parabola’s genuine talent, sweet voice and strong lyricism make for a perfect combination, culminating superbly in Fire, a transition from her usual singer/songwriter style adding an electronic twist. \nDrawing comparisons to Sarah McLachlan, Adele, and Tori Amos, Parabola began writing songs as a teenager before joining UK-based band Dreamfield. Parabola West is her first solo project after a break away from the music industry, and working on new material has revitalised her inherent love for making music and telling stories. Fire is the first official single since her acclaimed debut EP, ‘Did You Hear?’ which was released in March of 2014. Having already caught the attention of discerning music lovers, Fire won the $10,000 Making Tracks grant from NZ On Air and theaudience.co.nz’s Wildcard Funding Chart winner in May 2015. The track was produced at The Lab Studio in Mt Eden with Olly Harmer and Jol Mulholland. \nDirected by Shae Sterling, the video for Fire was filmed at the artist’s own off-the-grid home in Raglan, along with a range of other stunning New Zealand locations. The song has become a firm favourite amongst her fans and Parabola admits that audience feedback may have indeed contributed to the planning of the music video. \"I always get comments about how ‘Fire’ feels like it should be in an episode of ‘Game of Thrones,’ she says, \"and so the music video certainly has a nod to that idea.\" With the experience to go the distance and a steadily growing following of loyal fans, Parabola West and Fire are sure to make an impression.
