But kids. Players who will not be 30 until past 2020. Hitters who last season played in college or the instructional league. Kids in the dawn of their major league careers.\nThe playoffs in their first season? Isn't it always this way?\n\"It's been a lot of fun so far,\" the 23-year-old Bryant said.\nThe Cubs' core of young talent has propelled the team into the National League Championship Series for the first time since 2003, blasting tape-measure home runs, celebrating big hits with playful helmet rubs, brushing aside playoff adversity and pressure like crumbs from the kitchen table.\nUnder the tutelage of manager Joe Maddon, and with the help of veteran players who have had playoff success elsewhere, the youthful Cubs have electrified loyal fans who have been burned time and again by infamous postseason flameouts. Too young to know better, or to care, this team is charging forward in the postseason without the emotional baggage that comes with playoff losses or famous failures.\nMost of the players don't remember the Cubs' playoff collapse in 1984 or the club's 1989 NLCS loss for good reason: They hadn't been born yet. When the much-ballyhooed 2003 collapse occurred, many of the Cubs' current infielders were in middle school.\n\"The narrative of the Cubs is that of futility. These young Cubs didn't get the email that they are part of a losing organization,\" said Mark Reinecke, a psychologist at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. \"That is not their history or their experience. Maybe that's a good thing.\"\nIn the Cubs' Game 3 National League Division Series win, Schwarber, 22 years old, Bryant, Soler, 23, Rizzo 26, and Starlin Castro, 25, all homered. Veteran outfielder Dexter Fowler, still five months away from turning 30, added another as the Cubs set a postseason record with six homers in one game. Javier Baez, 22, who started for the injured Addison Russell, 21, joined the party with a three-run shot in the deciding Game 4. Rizzo also connected later, to give the Cubs the lead, and Schwarber's mammoth insurance-run homer that landed atop the right field scoreboard became an overnight sensation.\nKyle Schwarber calls encased home run ball 'great honor' Colleen Kane Kyle Schwarber called it “pretty cool” that his home run ball from Tuesday’s National League Division Series clincher will be encased atop the right-field video board at Wrigley Field for the remainder of the playoffs.\nBut the Cubs rookie also wasn’t going to get too caught up in the hoopla surrounding...\nKyle Schwarber called it “pretty cool” that his home run ball from Tuesday’s National League Division Series clincher will be encased atop the right-field video board at Wrigley Field for the remainder of the playoffs.\nBut the Cubs rookie also wasn’t going to get too caught up in the hoopla surrounding...\n(Colleen Kane) At the start of the season, Bryant, Schwarber, Russell and Baez all were in the minor leagues. And this list does not even include ace pitcher Jake Arrieta, 29, a candidate for the Cy Young Award.\n\"I think we have a lot of charismatic young players that are attempting to play the game properly,\" said Maddon, who has masterfully harnessed the young talent. \"I don't think you've heard one excuse from any of them. They're very accountable.\"\nBy ousting Pittsburgh in the wild-card game and St. Louis in the division series, the Cubs' youngsters and their exuberance have trumped postseason experience.\n\"They are ignorant to the history and any of the bad stuff,\" said fan Bill Dwoinen, 35, of Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood, who wore a Bryant No. 17 jersey outside Wrigley Field before Game 4 against the Cardinals. \"(Game 3) was a perfect example. They could have crumbled, but they didn't. Their ignorance right now is totally an advantage. Experience matters, but when they're as talented as they are, then it really doesn't.\"\nThe roster of young Cubs has been assembled by team President Theo Epstein under an ambitious, patient rebuilding effort aimed at reshaping the team with a focus on talented prospects alongside proven starters. To many, the Cubs are winning a year ahead of schedule, with most of the young core signed for relatively inexpensive contracts and under team control for several years.\nMaddon deflects credit to the front office, the team's veterans and his coaching staff for finding and guiding the group of 20-somethings, especially former major league slugger Manny Ramirez, who helps the young Latin players. But the players' demeanor and approach also are essential, the manager said, and the Cubs have assembled a group of young players who not only can hit and pitch and field, but are mature beyond their years.\n\"They are really good makeup guys,\" Maddon said. \"They're good character guys. They don't make excuses. They're very accountable to the moment.\"\nBryant, from Las Vegas, was thought by many analysts to be a star-in-waiting when the Cubs chose him with the second overall pick in the 2013 draft out of the University of San Diego. His arrival at Wrigley Field was much anticipated, and after striking out three times in his major league debut at Wrigley on April 17, he had a Rookie of the Year-type season, hitting 26 homers and driving in 99 runs.\nThe Cuban-born Soler, signed by the Cubs in 2012, played in 24 games a season ago, then was plagued by injuries in the regular season before making an impact in the division series. He reached base safely in his first nine playoff plate appearances, hit a Game 3 homer and prevented the Cardinals' go-ahead run from scoring in Game 4 by throwing out a runner at home plate from right field.\nFor Schwarber, who was drafted in the first round in 2014 out of Indiana University and made his major league debut June 16, \"it's been a crazy ride.\" Fans now chant his name when he takes the field and post about \"#Schwarbomb\" on social media. After the Cubs won Tuesday, he high-fived admirers in a lap around Wrigley during the postgame celebration.\n\"It could have been a totally different story if I was on a different team,\" Schwarber said. \"Coming into this organization and them believing in me all the way from our front office to our ownership to our coaches. And then when I did come up with our players, they made it so easy on me to come up and just do my job, and that's play baseball. It could have been rookie this, rookie that, you do that. It wasn't any of that. It was, you're here to help us win.\"\nRizzo said he remembers seeing Schwarber during a Wrigley Field workout last year, chuckling and thinking \"Good luck.\" Now the two are teammates. The attitude among the players and coaching, Rizzo and Bryant said, is one of selflessness and support, no matter the age or experience level.\n\"That's what this organization does,\" Rizzo said. \" … We make them feel like, 'Let's go. You're here. You don't have to worry about doing something different, you just be yourself and go play baseball.'\"\nTo season-ticket holder Jackie McCormick, 54, Maddon is the glue, who keeps the young squad focused and tension-free. During batting practice Monday, the players laughed and jumped around the infield. The on-field celebration with players' families after the NLDS win went on for more than an hour. During the season, the players wore goofy pajamas for the flight back to Chicago from Los Angeles after Arrieta pulled a no-hitter against the Dodgers.\n\"I think they're so loose; they're having fun,\" McCormick said. \"I think it's a different vibe, and that starts with Joe. He's a free spirit. I don't think the veterans would wear their onesies on the airplane.\"\nMaddon said players' experience, or lack thereof, can go both ways. The Cubs' youth has been an advantage \"only because we've been doing well. If we had not been doing well, then this lack of experience would be working against us.\"\nIt was important, Maddon said, that many of the young players persevered through initial struggles to peak for the stretch drive and the playoffs.\n\"The thing that I like is that a lot of our guys have met adversity on the major league level, which is different than meeting adversity at the minor league level,\" Maddon said. \"When you have to handle it or meet it here and overcome it, it's absolutely different and absolutely has a chance to be more long-standing in a sense because you've done it here and you know how to do it again.\"\nIf the Cubs are to advance to their first World Series in 70 years, the core of young players will have to continue to spurn the pressure of playing in a championship-starved ballpark in front of fans who have been awaiting a title for a lifetime.\n\"We put all our individual selfishness aside, and we're really focused on winning these games and doing whatever we can, whether it just (is) being a great teammate and supporting the guy who's doing it that day,\" Bryant said. \" … Hopefully we can play many more games this year.\"\npoconnell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pmocwriter\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon Kris Bryant Kyle Schwarber Wrigley Field", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201d8c/turbine/ct-funny-chicago-cubs-photos-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200b64/turbine/ct-kyle-schwarber-home-run-ball-20151015", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201429/turbine/ct-cubs-youth-attitude-met-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:16:32.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
