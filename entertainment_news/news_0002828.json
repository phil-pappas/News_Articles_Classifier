Renee’s Cup Day fashion tips \nWestfield stylist and gt columnist Renee Enright lists her top tips for Cup Day fashion. \n— My one tip each and every year come spring racing season is to keep it classy. \n— Colour is such a huge trend this season so expect to see plenty of bold hues and vibrant prints. \n— Classic monochrome is always on point and I expect to see plenty of white-on-white fresh spring looks. \n— With lace also being such a standout trend for spring/summer, I think we will definitely see this feature heavily trackside. \n— Off the shoulder detail dresses and tops will also be quite popular, as will crowns and delicate headwear. \n— Ensure you have an option for wet/cold weather, like a structured blazer or jacket. \n— Comfortable shoes are key, so think wedges or thick-set heels. \n— For the gents, navy is going to be a nice alternative to black suits. \n— Guys, ensure you have a well fitted suit and step outside the box a little. \n— And have fun with your accessories — pocket squares, fun printed ties or headwear can be the little finishing touch your outfit needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:52:04.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
