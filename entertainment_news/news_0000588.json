Principal photography began on Monday, September 28 in New York. According to sources, filming will also take place in North Carolina, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The miraculous event happened on January 15, 2009 and was called \"Miracle on the Hudson.\" Shortly after takeoff, Sully was forced to take drastic measures to save the lives of all the passengers aboard. Although people all over the world praised his aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career. Todd Komarnicki will pen the screenplay based on Sully's own 2009 autobiography entitled \"Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters\", which he wrote with Jeffrey Zaslow. Tom Hanks stars as the heroic pilot with Aaron Eckhart (\" Olympus Has Fallen \", \" The Dark Knight \") tapped to star as co-pilot Jeff Skiles. Clint Eastwood will direct the film and produce alongside Tim Moore and veteran producers Allyn Stewart and Frank Marshall. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Sully News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:25:45.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
