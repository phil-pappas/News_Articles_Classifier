Posted just a moment ago \nABC/Fred Lee (LOS ANGELES) -- Jennifer Lawrence took on Hollywood's gender pay gap in an essay in Lena Dunham’s e-newsletter, Lenny , titled \"Why Do I Make Less than My Male Co-Stars?\" Lawrence partially blamed herself for the disparity, but now Deadline offers some insight into why she made less than her American Hustle co-stars, Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper. \nIndustry analyst Mike Fleming Jr. wrote, \"Everybody on that particular film worked for heavy discount to make the numbers work. By the time Lawrence was brought in by her Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell to round out that stellar cast, deals were done with other cast members.\" \nFleming also claims that both Cooper, Russell and Bale each gave up a piece of their personal share of movie's profits -- known as \"points\" -- to Lawrence, to bring up her compensation, even though she worked fewer days than anyone in the cast. \nOverall, Fleming reports that he was told that Lawrence worked 19 days and was paid $1.25 million, with an additional $250,000 in deferred compensation, and seven points. Bale, Fleming was told, worked 45 days, and was paid $2.5 million and got nine points. Cooper was paid $2.5 million for 46 days of work, and received nine points. But Fleming says the person in the cast who got the worst deal was Amy Adams, who received $1.25 million for 45 days, plus seven points. \nFleming adds that Lawrence also made tons of cash after the hit film was released thanks to its 10 Oscar nominations. \nJ. Law wrote in Lenny that she was \"mad\" at herself because she \"failed as a negotiator.\" She added that she didn't fight hard enough because she didn’t want to come across as \"difficult\" or \"spoiled.\" \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
