In the third season, Emmy nominated Vic Rallo takes viewers on a culinary adventure throughout Italy to explore the concepts of “la materia prima” – the finest quality of ingredients – and the phenomenon known as “kilometer zero” – the concept of harmonizing ingredients-using locally sourced ingredients and wines in one's cuisine. In Season Three, he-along with Italian wine expert Anthony Verdoni-also introduces many undiscovered Italian wine varieties while educating viewers on the more popular Italian wines.\nVic serves as tour guide as he energetically and enthusiastically moves from ground to table, whether working in the kitchen alongside local chefs-some Michelin starred-or wandering in the vineyards with vintners whose families have dedicated their lives to the art of winemaking. From cheese to fish, from homemade pastas and soups to vegetables and meats, each episode will satisfy foodies with unique takes on traditional recipes, and the bonus of some of the best scenery Italy has to offer. Each episode will tell the story of the men and women who are creating some of Italy’s best cuisine and wines and the relationships Vic has formed through his extensive travels from North to south of Italy. The third season of Eat! Drink! Italy! takes viewers across Italy, typically presenting three segments per program.\n“Season Three offers our viewers more of the types of recipes and food stories they’ve asked for over the last two years. We’ve also added informative and useful segments on outstanding but unknown Italian wines that are now ready for their place on your table.” explained executive producer and director Mark Ganguzza. “For centuries our ancestors used the food outside their doors,” added Rallo. “For centuries the plot line hasn’t changed a bit: passionate Italians using ingredients found literally outside their doors to create food and wine that is second to none. And, it just keeps getting better and more approachable.”\nVic Rallo is the owner of Birravino, a trattoria in Red Bank, New Jersey, and Undici Taverna Rustica in Rumson, New Jersey which offers a traditional rustic Italian menu.
