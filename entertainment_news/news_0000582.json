Young cocaine sniffers in Mexico are being blamed for starting the trend. It requires people to video record or simply snap a photo of themselves inhaling the narcotic and challenging a friend to do the same.\nKnow as the #retodelpasesito or “Little pass challenge” it’s an excuse to abuse a drug that’s no doubt a lucrative source of income for Mexico’s drug traffickers. As much as the trend is gaining steam for those dumb enough to share their drug use with the world, there have been plenty of warnings about the danger, or “peligro” associated with the use of cocaine.\nBut not everyone is on board with this one as a Change.org petition was started recently to dissuade people form abusing the drug in the name of a social media challenge. Instead, the petition which calls the abuse of chemical drugs a form of suicide, tells people to consider the ice bucket challenge from which the cocaine version is based, instead.", "external_links":
