It is set for theatrical release Nov. 13.\n\"I am thrilled and honored that our film is playing a part in celebrating the five-year anniversary of this momentous event,\" director Patricia Riggen said in a statement.\n\"Our main goal in making The 33 was to show the courage and resilience of the men who were trapped, the hope and faith of their families, and the determination of the rescuers who overcame near-impossible odds to bring them home. Their inspiring story captured the attention of millions five years ago and it should never be forgotten.\"\n  Film version of 'Z-Men' graphic novel in the works at Lionsgate Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton to receive Hollywood Film Awards 'The Martian' tops the North American box office with $37M Hugh Jackman, Rooney Mara and Joe Wright re-invent Peter 'Pan' tale for a new generation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:21:38.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
