American country music singer Carrie Underwood. Sony Music Australia. Subscribe Now \nCARRIE Underwood's latest album marks the start of a new chapter in the singer's life. The American country music chart-topper welcomed her son Isaiah, her first child, with husband Mike Fisher while working on Storyteller, her fifth studio album, which was released on Friday. \"I started the album before I was pregnant and worked on it during and after I had Isaiah,\" Underwood tells APN. \"It was scattered. It was just kind of the way it worked out. I think it ended up being a real blessing getting to take the extra time to live with some of the songs for a little longer. The album's closing track, What I Never Knew I Always Wanted, is a heartfelt dedication to the two men in Underwood's life. \"It's about not knowing I needed either of them until I had them,\" she says. \"Now I can't imagine my life any other way. \"The people you come into contact with and are important in your life are like pieces to the puzzle. Your puzzle's not finished until you're old and grey and have figured everything out, I guess. Those important people you definitely need in your life and you don't know they were missing until you have them.\" Underwood rose to fame as the fourth winner of American Idol and has gone on to sell 58 million albums and win seven Grammy Awards. American country music singer Carrie Underwood. Sony Music Australia \nThis year she also became the first country artist asked to headline Apple Music Festival. While the influences of Underwood's happy new family life can be found throughout Storyteller, the album also includes character-driven stories on songs such as Church Bells, Mexico and Renegade Runaway. \"It's fun (singing those character-driven songs). It's like playing a role,\" she says. \"I can sing about things I would never do or things that are kind of wild or illegal or something. It's fun to slip into that role for a minute and sing about those things. \"On Mexico, you don't know what they did. I always assumed they robbed a bank or something and now they're running from the cops. On Renegade Runaway, the character is definitely not me; she's a leaver. She can't stay with the same guy or in the same place for too long.\" Underwood hasn't announced an Australian tour in support of the album yet, but she hopes to return to our shores next year. \"I certainly hope we are lucky enough to get to go there,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:31:19.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
