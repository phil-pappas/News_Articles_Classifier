However, all the issues were sorted now as Vijay himself stepped in to resolve the issue. Puli (U): Book Your Tickets Right Away! \nHe reportedly gave a word to a prominent financier and asked him to clear all the debts and brought in a clearance for the film's release. \nThe Telugu version of Puli is releasing in huge number of theaters all over Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and SVR media acquired the rights for a whopping price. Puli Telugu version must collect a theatrical share of 8.5 Cr to be a profitable venture. \n\nApparently, Puli will roar from the 10 AM show all over the Telugu states and Vijay fans were already waiting at the theaters since last night. \nFans, who were disappointed due to the cancellation of premieres, are still hooking around the theaters to catch the film at the first show. \nAlso, many of the Tamil as well as Telugu celebrities took to twitter to support Vijay in this tough situation as they felt it is a pre-planned ploy on Vijay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:16:12.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
