By Indo-Asian News Service on October 26, 2015 at 2:11 AM Comments \nActress Monica Bellucci says she is looking forward to menopause and adds that she is not worried about ageing. ”Menopause is a natural thing, it is not a sickness. OK, the body at the beginning will get a bit mad. But after a few months, or one year, it’s going to be OK. This is a natural process of life. I am not nervous about it at all,” Bellucci told dailymail.co.uk. \nThe “Don’t Look Back” actress, who has two daughters with her estranged husband Vincent Cassel, added that she is looking forward for the physical change. ”Listen, I had two kids – one when I was 40, one when I was 45. I breastfed for one year, which means I was breastfeeding four years ago. I’m going to move from giving birth to menopause. Anyway the menopause is going to be great: no periods any more.” \nBellucci, who will be seen in the new James Bond movie “Spectre”, also said she does not worry about ageing.”I’ve had old people in my life that I really loved – especially women – so I’m not scared about getting old. It’s what’s inside that makes us beautiful on the outside,” she said. However, the 51-year-old actress says she does not have an issue with those who have undergone plastic surgery delay their ageing process. \n“I’ve nothing against using something to help your beauty – but do it in a good way, with intelligence. I do acupuncture. Because it really helps. It is the opposite of Botox. Botox blocks and acupuncture moves. Botox for some people is really good. For others they have different reactions. I am for freedom,” she said. \n  26, 2015 2:31 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:50:04.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
