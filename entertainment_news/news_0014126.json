The company did not reveal any proper reason but it hinted towards a technical issue owing to which the deliveries had to be stopped. Recently, the quality assurance department of Volkswagen has discovered that these cars have been found to have a defective handbrake that could not function properly in certain conditions. As a result, a total of 389 units of this model have been called back, that belong to the September 2015 batch. These cars will be examined properly and then will be repaired to ensure safety. \nYou may also like: Volkswagen Investigated by ARAI \nWhen the matter was closely analysed and studied, the results suggested that a batch of handbrake cable retention levers in the rear brake liner are not strong enough to withstand certain effects and can break apart. This might lead to accident-like situations and the occupants can get harmed considerably. Some of the units which have been identified with this faulty mechanism are already sold out. Hence, the company is contacting those who own these models. \nDetails on: Volkswagen Polo \nIn order to mend the vehicles and to carry out the required procedure, there will be a workshop that will be conducted on an immediate basis. Here, customers can bring in their Polos and those will be checked, followed by the required remedial measure. No cost will be incurred by the customers as the whole expense will be taken care by Volkswagen. As we know that the company is already troubled by the emission scandal. In such a situation, it will definitely not afford any risk of losing the customers' faith any further. \nGet latest and updated information about automobiles on our Google Plus Community Speed Gears .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:10:52.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
