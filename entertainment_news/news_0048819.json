This documentary offers an insight into the fascinating sub-culture of sulky racers, meeting people who care deeply about their piebalds, and yet who race on the wild side - on Sundays at dawn and on roads blocked off to traffic. We meet owners and drivers based in Dublin, Meath, Clare and Limerick, who show the extremes they will go to in order to prepare their horses for race day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:10:24.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
