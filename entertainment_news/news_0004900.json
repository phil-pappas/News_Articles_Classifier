Union Square Hospitality Group's restaurants aren't quite so exclusive (you might have to accept an early/late time to book a table at Gramercy, but you'll get in), so the new policy will affect more everyday diners.\nThe inspiration for the change, according to a letter Meyer published online, was to \"provide meaningful career opportunities\" for the group's 1,800 employees, and to compensate them \"equitably, competitively and professionally.\"\nTranslation: Eliminating tipping (and increasing menu prices accordingly) will allow Meyer's group to address the widening compensation gap between front-of-house (waiters and other servers) and back-of-house (line cooks and other kitchen personnel) workers.\n\"We believe hospitality is a team sport,\" Meyer said.\nThe first restaurant to make the no-tipping switch will be The Modern, the two-Michelin-star restaurant inside the Museum of Modern Art. Meyer said the rest of the group's properties will be no-tipping by the end of next year.\nPhil Vettel is a Tribune critic\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ee8d1/turbine/ct-danny-meyers-restaurant-group-to-eliminate-tipping-by-end-of-2016-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:20:49.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
