I probably shouldn't talk too much on it, but I do know some things,\" says Howard. \nShe spent two hours chasing and being chased by dinosaurs while wearing high heels. \n\"Here's what I'll tell you – when it was official that there was gonna be a sequel, the way I found out, was that Colin texted me, #NoHeels2018,\" says Howard. \nFans for now though will have to make themselves content with their BluRays. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:13:44.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
