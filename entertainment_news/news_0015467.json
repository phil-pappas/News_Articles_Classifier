The 18-year-old boy was all smiles when he was photographed strolling around the street in Los Angeles on Saturday, October 24. The eldest son of Michael was pictured alongside his pal. Prince flaunted his growing muscles in a navy tank top with the Ford logo. He paired his tank top with gray shorts and black sneakers. He completed his look with green hat, silver necklaces, rings and watch. A pair of earphones could be seen hanging around his neck. Earlier this month, Prince responded to a Twitter troll who alleged that he's not the son of the late King of Pop. The Twitter user wrote, \"@princemjjjaxon Everyone knows you are a Rowe-Klein NOT A Jackson!! Yall should stop trying to put on a FAKE front and get real.\" Prince then replied, \" 'The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb' I was raised by my dad with my brother and sister.\" Prince's tweet suggested that he and Michael weren't related by blood but the late singer was the only father he knew. In other words, the bond he had with the late singer was stronger than that with his supposed biological father. There have been swirling rumors saying that Michael's children are from Debbie Rowe's relationship with his dermatologist, Dr. Arnie Klein. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:11:22.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
