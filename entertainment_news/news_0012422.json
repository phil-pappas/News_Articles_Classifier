Through this life-changing book, Teddy embraces his origins and finds the peace of mind he’s been looking for.\n“I’ll always be with you” offers insight into the trials of facing racial tensions and prejudices while encouraging the celebration of culture and traditions.\n“Our heritage is important in determining who we are. As a first-generation American, I grew up feeling inferior because my family was ‘ethnic,’” Armour said. “Now I’m thankful my parents kept our European culture and traditions alive while becoming the best Americans they could be.”\n“I’ll Always Be With You”\nBy Violetta Armour\nISBN: SC 978-1-4917-6830-3 HC 978-1-4917-6832-7 e 978-1-4917-6831-0\nAvailable in softcover, hardcover, e-book\nAvailable on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and IUniverse\nAbout the author\nVioletta Armour, author of “I’ll always be with you”, currently resides in Phoenix, Arizona.
