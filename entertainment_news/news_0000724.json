At the onset of Trump announcing his GOP presidential candidacy, an attack on undocumented immigrants, accelerated his campaign through the media.\nGOP had received a colorful individual to spruce their drab and bland aura. Trump brought excitement and frankness to the GOP party. Corporate media loved it.\nPoll numbers were extremely favorable for Trump and he embraced it. A once less significant factor, polls, has become a verification for candidates. Before big money in political campaigns, politician would make statements that 'they didn't pay much attention to polls'. This is not a common statement any more.\nPolls have become indicative whether a candidate receives major contributions from big donors. This led to an unprecedented number of GOP candidates who decided to vie for the political prize money.\nDonald Trump presented a differen angle. As long as Trump received free media attention due to his poll numbers, it wasn't necessary to spend any of his own reported billions. Donald Trump was given free access to say or do practically whatever he desired.\nCoporate media and even international media, became intrugued of the non-establishment GOP presidential candidate and his run away poll numbers. Without any experience as a public servant, the real estate magnate, pole vaulted above his contemporaries by hitting at a tender issue, immigrations.\nMarco Rubio had been selected as the golden boy in 2013 to bring leadership and intelligence to the GOP's answer to immigration. Rubio proposed a $30 billion budget and a legal pathway for the 11 million undocumented immigrants. But, when Eric Cantor was not re-elected in his district for supporting a reform immigrations platform, Rubio dropped the issue like a bad habit.\nTrump seized the moment the ball was dropped by the GOP to hit the immigration issue with neither diplomacy or tact, but with raw grit. He expressed racist statements towards Mexicans to make a point of seemingly unrestricted numbers of immigrants in American cities and towns.\nMany conservatives applauded Trump with an enthusiastic and \"way to go Donald\" attitude. Corporate media was estatic and encouraged the revelry.\nCorporate media has allowed Trump's novelty to run its course and now the luster has become a bit dull. His White House ambition may not be a free media endeavor any more. And his pursuit to antagonize the White House and politicians in general for humiliating his prior engagement in politics, via the \"birther\" issue, may not be enough incentive to go at his goal without free media gifts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:47:00.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
