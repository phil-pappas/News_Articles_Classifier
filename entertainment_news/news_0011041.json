The academy is best known as the presenter of Hollywood's annual Academy Awards ceremony.\n(Reporting by Dan Freed in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins and Cynthia Osterman )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:35:01.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
