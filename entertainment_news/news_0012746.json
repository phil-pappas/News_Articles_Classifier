The latest version will allow brands and influencers to collaborate and create branded content at scale on Instagram, Vine and Twitter, in addition to YouTube.\n“After developing the largest scalable self-service marketplace for YouTube collaborations, we had the proper infrastructure in place to expand on that process across platforms that are very different,” said David Kierzkowski, co-founder and CEO of FameBit. “Within just a few days of our soft launch, we've already seen hundreds of multi-platform campaigns deployed by brands, and influencers across these networks sent thousands of proposals for branded content creation, adding an additional 50 million reach to our network.”\nPrior to this new release, FameBit was already working with more than 17,000 YouTube influencers, with a combined reach of over 700 million subscribers. The platform has connected content creators with brands like L’Oreal, Adidas, Marvel and Office Depot to produce over 20,000 branded videos to date, with nearly 1 billion minutes of branded video content viewed by consumers. Brands can use FameBit to post about the type of branded content they’re seeking, and influencers submit proposals with their content ideas that incorporate the brand. Instagram, Vine and Twitter influencers with more than 1,000 followers can sign up to use FameBit at https://famebit.com/influencers .\n“As influence marketing continues to evolve, our goal with the multi-platform marketplace is to offer brands the most comprehensive marketing strategy that scales through self-service,” said Agnes Kozera, co-founder and COO of FameBit. “This means giving brands the tools to tap into influencers’ other social platforms within one campaign, providing more storytelling options and even greater audience reach.”\nEarlier this year, FameBit acquired Refame, a short-form video marketing agency that connected influencers with advertisers on Vine, Instagram and Snapchat. The company has also expanded into original programming with FilterFree TV the first uncensored digital talk show starring YouTube influencers, which takes an honest look at the most difficult questions and problems that Millennials face.\nFor more information, visit http://www.famebit.com\nAbout FameBit:\nFameBit is the leading self-service marketplace where brands and social media influencers collaborate for product or service endorsements.
