It features Attakathi Dinesh, Mia George, and Nivedha in the lead. The actor says she plays a radio jockey in the film. “Unlike what it appears to be, the job of a radio jockey is extremely difficult and challenging. I realised this as I spent time with other RJs in a private firm while they were at work. The director wanted me to observe them for at least 10 days. \nIf I have played my role with conviction, it is because of what I learnt there,” she says. Riythvika says that initially she was not interested in this project but the director was very particular. “Once I listened to the script, I immediately agreed. If I had not, I would have missed a wonderful opportunity,” she adds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:29:39.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
