Levin Milwaukee Ballet is launching a fundraising Campaign for New Work so it can create more productions like its hit “Peter Pan.” A 2012 performance featured Marc Petrocci and Valerie Harmon. By Jim Higgins of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 13, 2015 12:01 p.m. Milwaukee Ballet artistic director Michael Pink has extended his contract for five more seasons. Milwaukee Ballet Julia Glawe is the Milwaukee Ballet’s new executive director. \nThe Milwaukee Ballet is beginning its new season by taking steps to strengthen both its business operations and its ability to create the new works that artistic director Michael Pink takes pride in staging. \nThe ballet's board has named Julia Glawe its new executive director, the company's business leader. Since January 2013, Glawe has been director of booking for Pomegranate Arts, an independent production company in New York. For 16 years before that, she was director of the dance division for performing arts management company IMG Artists. \nGlawe also worked previously in bookings and educational outreach for Chicago's Hubbard Street Dance Company. \nThe executive director position has been open since February 2014, when former executive Dennis Buehler departed. In the interim, Pink wore both leadership hats, assisted by board members and staff. \nThe ballet also has extended Pink's contract as artistic director for five more years. Pink joined the Milwaukee Ballet in 2002; he has coached his dancers longer than any current NFL coach other than Bill Belichick has led his team. \nRecognizing Pink's passion for and commitment to staging new productions, the ballet board has launched a Campaign for New Work, stoked by a $300,000 challenge grant from Sue and Allan (Bud) Selig. \nDuring Pink's tenure, Milwaukee Ballet has staged world premieres of three full-length ballets, \"Peter Pan,\" \"Mirror Mirror\" and \"La Bohème,\" as well as 46 original shorter works. \nThe ballet opens its season Oct. 22-25 with Pink's \"Dracula\" at the Marcus Center, 929 N. Water St. For info, visit milwaukeeballet.org . © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
