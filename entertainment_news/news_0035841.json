Sarah Sudhoff has resigned as executive director of the Houston Center for Photography. New HCP director quits suddenly 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The executive director of the Houston Center for Photography has resigned suddenly, just 10 months after taking the job.\nIn a letter to friends Friday, Sarah Sudhoff offered no explanation for her quick departure, saying only that she was announcing her departure \"with mixed emotions.\"\nBoard members of the 35-year old organization were in a meeting and not available for immediate comment. Ansering the phone, staffer Joseph Roberts said Sudhoff resigned \"to work on her own art and spend more time with her family.\"\nSudhoff's resignation is the second abrupt departure this week of a local arts executive. Fresh Arts executive director Jenni Rebecca Stephenson, an outspoken advocate for the city's small arts organizations, left her post just as quickly on Monday.\nStay tuned.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/77/8839157/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/77/8839157/4/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:31:37.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
