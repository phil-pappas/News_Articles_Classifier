Check out how well they deal with their stuck-up clients (children and parents alike) in the below pilot. \n► Croissant Man \nWinner, Best Cinematography category \nThis bizarre series about a sentient, French-accented croissant puppet was created by a former barista living in Washington Heights who had something of an existential crisis while staring at the unsold pastries in the coffee shop where she worked, according to the series' website. The show has two seasons available through Amazon Prime, but you can see the Season 1 trailer here: \n► UNSINGLE \nWinner, Made in New York and Emerging Voices category \nThis irreverent, alcohol-soaked series about three “unsingle” women and the men in their lives features Los Angeles-based comedy trio LadyPantz. Full episodes aren’t out yet, but check out the trailer below: \n► Anamnesis \nWinner, Best Directing and Best Drama category \nThis spooky, sci-fi thriller tells the story of a group of strangers who start having some seriously creepy — and similar — lucid dreams that start coming true. Kind of like “Inception,” but with more murder. Here’s the first episode: \n► 47 Secrets to a Younger You \nHonorable mention, Made in New York category \nThis series was made by two local Brooklyn moms about two working moms trying to deal with aging, dating and that ever elusive work/life balance. The show was shot this summer in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens and features scenes from local hangouts like Prospect Park.
