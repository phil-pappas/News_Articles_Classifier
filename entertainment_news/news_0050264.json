I like being a part of someone else's vision it's really exhilarating,\" she added.\nLady Gaga endeared herself to the cast. Matt Bomer said some of her fellow actors called her by her given first name (her real name is Stefani Germanotta).\n\"it's sort of takes the mythos and all the preconceptions of Lady Gaga out of the equation so we can just relate to each other like human beings and actors in a scene,\" explained Bomer. \"She's so approachable that she totally just was there for us ... at by the time the cameras were rolling and we were in a scene together, we weren't thinking about the fact that you were doing a scene with Lady Gaga.\"\nDenis O'Hare spilled juicy details about the super exclusive bash Lady Gaga threw for the cast, which includes regulars like Angela Bassett, Sarah Paulson, and Kathy Bates.\n\"She had a pool; she dyed it blood red,\" said O'Hare. \"She had bathing suits for all of us. I jumped right in. I wore a woman's bathing suit at one point. She had a massive amount of food for us.\"\nBeing Lady Gaga, there was also some sauciness involved.\n\"She had a half-naked bartender for some of us it was an incredible party and it was just us, so it was comfortable and we all got to know each other,\" he said. \"She got a birthday cake for Angela. I can't describe it. It was an obscene birthday cake, it was shocking actually.\"\nSupermodel Naomi Campbell is among the new additions to the show. Campbell, who also appears on \"Empire,\" said the role came about when Ryan offered her a role over dinner. Up until Saturday night the cast wasn't able to discuss anything about the new season. The British supermodel said keeping hush hush was really easy for her.\n\"It's never been my thing of speaking before something happens,\" she said. \"I kind of find that bad luck.\"\nThe show premieres Wednesday night.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/american-horror-story/episodes \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
