In return, Vadivelu lashed out at the producer saying, \"I do not know anything about the business involved in films. I am just an actor and I did my job. How I can be held responsible for the film's financial loss?\" The trend of producers demanding that actors refund the financial losses that are incurred when a film flops is not new to the industry. In fact, even after Superstar Rajinikanth's film Lingaa flopped at the BO, the distributors claimed compensation from the producer Rockline Venkatesh and Rajinikanth. So, is it fair that a hero be held responsible for the financial loss of a film? Here's what the industry folks have to say.\nAn industry insider tells us, \"When a hero gets a salary of 50 per cent from the total budget of the film, then, he is responsible to repay the financial losses that the distributor and the producers incur. If they get a whopping sum as their paycheck, and increase the budget of the film, they need to share the financial loss with the producer too. In Bollywood, a hero takes home a minimal salary, in addition to about 20 to 30 per cent of the profit that the film makes. In such cases, the producer will not face severe financial losses, even if the film bombs at the box office. It would be nice if the heroes here too, would adopt this means of profit sharing. If the film does well in the market, he can share the profit. And even if the film fails, still the producer will be at minimum risk. That's why the producers in Bollywood have not faced any critical financial losses like the ones the producers here have.\"\nActors here, however, disagree. Arya, feels that it is not fair to ask the actors to repay the financial losses. He says, \"We are just a part of the film like every other technician in the film's unit. We are paid for what we do and we fulfill our jobs as actors, and act according to the director's script. So, it is unfair to ask us to settle the financial loss that producers go through. If the film does well, nobody calls us and give us money. So, if a film does not do business as expected, how can we, as actors, be held responsible? Things such as holding a hero responsible for the loss of a film, can happen only here. That is why I have got into production too, so that I can be held responsible for both the profit and loss that the film makes.\"\nDid these issues exist during the MGR, Sivaji era? How did they handle it? Film historian Anandhan says, \"In those days, if a film flopped or didn't do the business as expected, producers used to amicably settle the issue with the distributors. It was never been out in the open, and the audience too, was not privy to such information. If the film didn't make much profit, the producer would voluntarily call the distributors and settle their losses. They would not give any room for further issues. If not a settlement, an amicable understanding between the producer and the distributor would be worked out, so that they could sort out the issue during the marketing of their next film. Earlier, the producers and the heroes too, would share a good relationship. If a particular hero's film caused some kind of a financial let down to the producer, the same hero would reduce his salary, in the next film that he would be doing with the same producer. That's how our veteran actors shared the responsibility with their producer.\"\n\"There are however, two sides to the coin â€” producers and distributors,\" says Producer Rockline Venkatesh, who recently produced Lingaa. He adds, \"Whenever a film flops and a financial crisis arises, usually the fault lies with both the producer and distributor. A producer approaches a hero and to convince him, they offer him a fancy remuneration thereby increasing the budget all by themselves. Producers themselves increase the market value of the hero and if the film runs down, the blame would naturally go to the hero. From the distributor's side, they usually buy a film from the producer for a whopping sum to compete with other distributors and theater owners. Later if the film bombs, they ask the producer to refund their financial loss. This is not fair. They should be aware of the market value before buying a film. So in this case, it is a problem between a producer and distributors. They have to sort out their issues. There is no need to drag heroes into this.\nThey cannot be held responsible for any kind of financial loss that a film faces after its release. But on humanitarian grounds, some heroes voluntarily shoulder the producer's loss. That's how Rajini sir shared the financial loss of Lingaa with me. It was very kind of him to do that. If an actor voluntarily chooses to bail a producer out, it is fine, but making it mandatory that he bears the loss with the producer is not fair.\"\nElaborating on how a distributor buys a film, distributor Sivakumar says, \"Though the star value of the actor in a film is one of the main factors we look at before buying a film, we take into consideration other things too. We find out how much the film is being talked about in the industry circles, we see the response of the trailer and we talk to our industry sources and we try and gauge if the film has really come out well before we decide to buy it. Recently a leading hero's last two releases had poor buys. But now after seeing an impressive trailer of his next film, it (the film) has been sold out in all areas, even before the release. Even then, some films do not do the business as expected, and we do miscalculate sometimes. I personally feel that the hero of the film is not responsible for the failure and hence he cannot be asked to settle the financial losses incurred. But certain producers sell the film for a sum more than it deserves, so certain distributors approach them (the producers) to repay the loss. Only in such cases should the producer be held responsible for the loss.\"\nIn Mollywood, however, things seem to be simpler. Producer Alwyn Antony says, \"If a film fails, it simply doesn't work. Nobody can be held responsible for it. As most of the film's here are made on shoestring budgets, financial losses too are minimal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:24:14.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
