Image 28 of 28 Thousands flock to Bayou City Art Festival 1 / 28 Back to Gallery Matthew Kanenberg of Humble rested on a bench in front of City Hall with one of his Bayou City Art Festival finds: a blue-hued oil painting with an image of a Tabasco bottle.\n\"We wanted something that goes with bluebonnets, and what better than Tabasco?\" he said.\nIt's the quirky, mostly art pieces that drew Kanenberg and his wife, Heather Kanenberg, both 40, to the two-day biannual festival, which ended Sunday in downtown and was expected to attract 20,000 people.\nLast fall, rainy weather kept festival attendance down at only 15,000. This weekend's sunny weather marked the first time in three years that it hadn't rained on the festival, according to a spokesperson.\nEvery spring, the festival is held at Memorial Park, which usually has higher attendance numbers. Some 30,000 people attended last March.\nVideo: On Snapchat: Bayou City Art Festival gets creative Back in front of City Hall, Heather Kanenberg meandered over to show her husband her find: a sugar-skull embellished gas can. \"I love that it's not pre-fab art. Everything here is unusual and great quality, and you get to meet the artists doing the work and hear their stories. That's why we come,\" she said.\nThe Bayou City Art Festival, now in its 44th year, attracts some 300 artists in 19 disciplines from across the nation. Proceeds from the event go to the Art Colony Association, a non-profit group that supports other nonprofit programs in the community.\nNew to the festival this year was the kids' free day, that admitted children ages 12 and under free on Sunday. The festival also had for the first time a \"Rising Artist Avenue,\" an area that showcased four emerging artists or ones new to the festival.\nVeronica Lee, 41, was one of the featured talents and showed her mix-media work made with photographs, silk-screen prints, wood and clay.\nA graduate of HISD's magnet school, the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Lee and her artist husband, Patrick Lee, and their two children recently moved back to Houston after living in Mexico. Houston's burgeoning art scene welcomed them back, she said.\n\"When I was growing up, I didn't think this type of world existed, that you could make a living as an artist,\" Lee said. \"I need to sell my work, and here, you can do that.\"\nThe festival is one of the nation's top outdoor fine-arts events and bring out Houston artists, like Carl Crawford, 36, of Columbia, South Carolina. He calls his work \"collage illusion,\" and he uses thousands of cut pieces of magazines to create jazz and dance figures that look like a painting when finished.\n\"These shows are way to stay in touch with your supporters. The reality is that people can buy art online now. Technology makes it easy for artists to sell, but it's still important to connect with customers,\" he said.\nThe festival's featured artist was Houston-based sculptor Harold Siefert, 59, who shows his bronze artwork at some 10 shows yearly across the country.\nSiefert discovered his artistic talent after being laid off from Chase Bank in 2000. He began taking art classes at the Glassell School of Art and was invited to participate in the Bayou City Art Festival in 2007.\nHis pieces sell from $50 to $6,500, and his \"Killer Shoe\" sculpture that's half stiletto pump and half alligator is a favorite among women. He used a real shoe to cast the mold and found an alligator figure on eBay.\n\"There were some lean years in the beginning, but I don't even think about my life before this. I work every day, and I like to bring humor and beauty to my work. It makes people smile.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775162/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774911/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774899/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774892/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774893/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775161/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/37/8775659/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775164/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774891/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/24/8774913/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774889/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774902/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774898/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774895/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774908/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774901/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774891/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774893/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774899/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775164/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774892/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774910/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774905/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/37/8775659/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774900/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774911/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774904/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774894/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774906/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/24/8774913/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774888/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774909/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774901/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774898/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774902/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774889/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774895/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774909/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775162/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774888/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774906/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774894/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774890/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775163/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775161/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774897/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774910/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774890/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774900/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774904/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774908/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774897/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/27/8775163/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/23/8774905/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:36:05.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
