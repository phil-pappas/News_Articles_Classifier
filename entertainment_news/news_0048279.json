Oct. 2, 2015 9:38 a.m. \nUnbreakable \nRhythm Nation/BMG \nJanet Jackson wants \"Unbreakable\" to be \"meaningful,\" and it would be regardless of her desires: It's the first all-new album since 2008 from the second-most-popular member of the Jackson family and thus her first all-new album since her brother Michael died in 2009. \nOn many ballads here, she uncannily echoes his incarnate romantic sweetness circa \"Off the Wall.\" The resumed presence of producer-songwriter team Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who helped Miss Jackson create her hugest signature hits, further emphasizes connections to the past. \nTheir push into the present — including the soft storm of seduction on \"No Sleeep\" (sic) and the Missy Elliott-aided twerking tease of \"BURNITUP!\" — isn't nearly so moment-dominating as the \"Rhythm Nation\" singles were from 1989 to 1991. \nNor, except for the funky 1970s-throwback closer of \"Gon' B Alright,\" does \"Unbreakable\" fully acknowledge that it's better as a cornucopia of varied pop pleasures than as a series of \"meaningful\" gestures. \nSpecial to the Journal Sentinel \nGeorge Strait \nCold Beer Conversation \nMCA Records \nLast year, George Strait brought nearly a million of his fans together for his farewell-to-the-road \"Cowboy Rides Away\" tour. Turns out he was riding to the recording studio. Like a Western version of U2 or Beyoncé, Strait surprised his fans last week when he both announced and released his 29th studio album. (The now retired-from-touring star also revealed an upcoming Las Vegas performance residency.) \nThe result — unsurprisingly, considering Strait's consistency — is an album as good as he's ever released. Don't confuse consistency with complacency. Strait finds new ways here to grasp our minds — and make us boot-scoot. \"It Takes All Kinds\" is a cheeky ode to acceptance in a swinging Texas groove that would make Bob Wills proud. Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally — two of Nashville's best contemporary songwriters — wrote \"Take Me to Texas,\" a home-state reflection that Strait delivers as a honky-tonk slow-dancer. And, in \"Everything I See,\" Strait pays respect to his late father in a brilliant song that will tug the heartstrings, and draw a few tears, for anyone who has experienced the loss of someone so close. Now, that's vintage Strait. \n— Erik Ernst, Special to the \nJournal Sentinel \nAll Across This Land \nVagrant Records \n\"We were stupid, strange and young at heart, and all we wanted was to rock 'n' roll,\" singer and songwriter Eric Earley sings, with more than a bit of Bruce Springsteen's windswept, blue-collar spirit, in \"Nights Were Made For Love,\" a throwback anthem of carefree youth in the heart of Blitzen Trapper's new eighth studio album. \nFor a band that has long experimented with how far they could stretch their sound, this disc finds Earley in a reflective mood that carries his nostalgia through the classic rock 'n' roll influences that shaped the Portland, Ore., band across the past two decades. \nThe opening \"All Across This Land\" bursts with rambling enthusiasm with a '70s arena-rock posture. In a blend of bluesy guitars and country melodies, \"Cadillac Road\" ponders the decisions of our past in the face of the future. And \"Let the Cards Fall\" finds peace with it all in the swirl of strings, grinding guitars and mournful harmonica and slide guitars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:53:10.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
