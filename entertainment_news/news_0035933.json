KURT MILLER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » IF YOU GO What: Third Thursday Food Fest\nWhen: The third Thursday of each month, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nWhere: Parking lot next to San Bernardino City Hall, 300 North D St.\nBustling crowds lined up for gourmet food truck offerings such as lobster rolls, sliders and cupcakes. Diners sat with friends to enjoy their lunch. An acoustic duo played.\nThe scene in a parking lot next to San Bernardino City Hall on Thursday, Oct. 15, reflects the image of downtown that city officials hope to showcase – that crowds will flock there if given a reason.\nThis week marked the one-year anniversary of Third Thursdays Food Fest, a monthly food truck festival launched by the city’s economic development department to bring more life downtown.\nMayor Carey Davis compared it to an outdoor food mall for the lunch-time crowd. He hopes the event’s success will draw more restaurants to the area.\n“I think they can see there really is opportunity,” Davis said.\nWith the concentration of city, county and state government offices downtown, about 8,000 government workers are looking for a place to eat lunch, city officials say.\nJuanita Allen-Saleem, who works for San Bernardino County’s probation department, was among those workers at the festival Thursday. She went a few months ago, loved it and came back with co-workers.\n“Usually, I bring my lunch so it’s a nice treat, a nice change of pace,” she said while waiting in line at the popular Cousin’s Main Lobster truck.\nThe downtown area has struggled for years – even before the city entered bankruptcy in 2012. The Carousel Mall began losing tenants more than a decade ago and remains mostly deserted. Several other businesses also left, leaving workers complaining of few dining options.\nSan Bernardino’s bankruptcy forced the city to cancel its signature downtown event, the Route 66 Rendezvous, in 2013. The city created the Rendezvous Back to Route 66 event to replace it. Crowds at the event’s third installment last week were larger, which Davis attributed to Third Thursdays.\nAs the city prepares for hearings on its plans to exit bankruptcy, officials are pursuing other efforts to turn the area around.\nThe council will consider an agreement next month with a developer to redevelop the Carousel Mall.\nIn spring, the city hopes to launch an evening arts festival to bring in crowds, city spokeswoman Monica Lagos said.\nCity Councilwoman Virginia Marquez, whose district includes downtown, said activities such as Third Thursday could start a downtown revival.\nIt wasn’t easy at first to get food trucks rolling into San Bernardino.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc2ig-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qd.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc2ig-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc2ih-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc2ig-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qd.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc2ih-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qj.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc2if-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3r8.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc2if-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3ra.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc2ig-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc2if-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3r8.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc2ig-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc2ig-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3qb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc2if-b88534899z.120151016145942000g9nck3ra.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:18:12.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
