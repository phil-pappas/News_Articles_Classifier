To celebrate and promote their new album, the boys visited \" The Ellen DeGeneres Show \" that day and played a mini concert for the audience. Ashton Irwin , Calum Hood , Michael Clifford and Luke Hemmings first performed their current single \"Hey Everybody!\" from their just-arrived set for the super excited crowd made up mostly of female teenagers. Later, they returned to the stage for older hit \"She Looks So Perfect\" from their 2014 self-titled debut album. During their appearance on the show, the four-piece also joined host Ellen DeGeneres and two lucky fans for a game called \"5 Second Rule\". The boys and the fans were divided into two teams, and each team was asked to hit the buzzer after naming three things in under 5 seconds. The game turned out a little bit messy as they kept giving the wrong answers and hitting the buzzer at the wrong time. \"Sounds Good Feels Good\" marks the Aussie band's second studio album. They will support the record with \"Sounds Live Feels Live\" tour which is opening in July 2016 in Uncasville, CT. Before then, they will perform at this year's iHeartRadio Jingle Ball 2015 Tour that starts on December 1. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:05:32.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
