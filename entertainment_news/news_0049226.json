A weak report on the U.S. jobs market is sending the stock market and the dollar sharply lower in early trading. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) By MATTHEW CRAFT | AP Business Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” A weak report on the U.S. jobs market pushed the stock market slightly lower Friday. U.S. employers cut back sharply on hiring in September and added fewer jobs in July and August than previously thought.\nThe news shot government bond prices higher, drove the dollar down and pushed big-bank stocks to deep losses as investors speculate that the Federal Reserve will keep a key interest rate at a record low.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down four points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,920, as of 12:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 27 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,245, while the Nasdaq composite declined 19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,607.\nWAY OFF: The government reported that employers added 142,000 workers last month, much lower than the 200,000 anticipated on Wall Street. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.1 percent, but only because many Americans have stopped looking for work so no longer counted as unemployed.\nNO SPIN: \"There's just no positive spin you can put on it,\" said Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist. \"Combined with other reports, it really raises questions about the strength of the recovery.\"\nFED: The report raised doubts that the Fed will start raising interest rates before the end of the year. The Fed has only two meetings left: one later this month and another in December. Until Friday morning, many investors thought the first increase would come soon.\n\"We see almost no way the Fed can raise rates at its October meeting,\" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at the brokerage BTIG in New York, in a note to clients. \"As a result of this report, investors should rightly be debating whether the Fed can or should raise rates at its December meeting.\"\nBATTERED BANKS: Financial firms in the S&P 500 sank 1.7 percent, by far the biggest loss among the index's 10 industry groups. Record-low interest rates pinch the profits banks make from lending money. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.45, or 2 percent, to $59.54, and Bank of America fell 52 cents, or 3 percent, to $15.02.\nNORDY NEWS: Nordstrom climbed after announcing that it will pay a special dividend and spend up to $1 billion buying its own shares. The department-store chain gained $1.35, or 2 percent, to $72.76.\nHACKED: T-Mobile sank on news that hackers had broken into a credit agency's network and stolen information on 15 million T-Mobile customers. The company's stock dropped 60 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.53.\nOTHER SIDE OF ATLANTIC: In Europe, major indexes finished slightly higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, France's CAC-40 rose 0.7 percent, and Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9 percent.\nCRUDE: Benchmark U.S. crude oil dropped 14 cents to $44.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent Crude, a benchmark for international oils, fell 27 cents to $48.12 a barrel in London.\nBONDS AND DOLLARS: U.S. government bond prices jumped, driving the yield on the 10-year down to 1.96 percent, its lowest level since April and a steep drop from 2.04 percent late Thursday. The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.1254 and the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 119.68 yen.\nASIA'S SCORECARD: Markets in the region drifted, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising less than 0.1 percent. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rebounded after a holiday, jumping 3.2 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.2 percent to 5,052.00. Markets on mainland China remain closed for holidays until Oct. 8.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/a225a60c44cdae2c830f6a7067002038.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/a225a60c44cdae2c830f6a7067002038.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:52:27.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
