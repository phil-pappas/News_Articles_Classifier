The originality of his 1748 opera “Zaïs,” which gets a formidable performance here by the French ensemble Les Talens Lyriques led by Christophe Rousset , is established right from the outset, with an overture depicting the formation of the universe out of chaos that begins with a stark kettledrum solo. And if nothing in the remaining four acts is quite that unorthodox — how could it be, really? — the music boasts all the restless variety and formal unpredictability of this most protean of Baroque geniuses. There are instrumental interludes both rustic and elegant, extravagantly dramatic scenes, and expansive vocal numbers that take unpredictable melodic detours on their way to an expected resolution. Rousset seems to exult in Rameau’s feverish inventiveness, and the cast led by tenor Julian Prégardien and soprano Sandrine Piau match his attentiveness at every step. — Joshua Kosman \nRAMEAU\nZAÏS\nLES TALENS LYRIQUES; CHRISTOPHE ROUSSET\nAPARTE (3 CDs)\n$37.98", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:30.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
