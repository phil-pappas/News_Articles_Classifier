People magazine issues gun violence 'call to action' FILE - In this Dec. 18, 2014 file photo, Peaople magazine editorial dorector Jess Cagle arrives at The People Magazine Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif. In the aftermath of the horrific Oregon school shooting, People magazine issued a “call to action,” asking readers to contact their representatives in Congress and find out what they’re doing about gun violence. It printed the names and phone numbers of all 535 voting members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Cagle said reaction so far has been “generally supportive.” But he added that some people had immediately criticized the magazine for taking a political stand which editors took pains not to do.
