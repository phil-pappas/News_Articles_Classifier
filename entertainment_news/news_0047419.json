Considering I had no voice yesterday and a sleepless night because of the meds (medication) I would say it's been a good day. \n\"I give 100 per cent in my performances even when people don't give much back. My fans know that. That's because I love what I do so much... Truth be told I've been unwell the past week and I could do with a long spell chill but I was determined to give everything for Oz (sic) today.\" \nMusician Bryan Adams and Chris Isaak also provided pre-match entertainment.
