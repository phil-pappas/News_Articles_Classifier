Performances are 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays-Saturdays and 3 p.m. Sundays through Nov. 1 at the Main Street Theatre, 335 Main. St., Conway. \nTim McGhee, the troupe’s executive/artistic director, called this a family friendly, “fun, fun show” with great songs, and he cited being “lucky” in casting everyone to match up to each character, including “a lot of new faces who have never been in major roles.” \nThe story centers on Gomez and Morticia Addams’ daughter, Wednesday, “coming of age,” McGhee said, and her “wanting to marry a normal person.’ \nA dinner with the fellow and his parents, none of whom anyone else in Addams clan has met, also gets lively. \n“It has a lot of great dancing, dancing, and a lot of one-liners,” McGhee said, priming audiences for the setting. “The whole show makes you go ‘Hmm.’ ” \nHe counts about 20 with acting parts and 18 behind stage to bring the Addamses back to life, since their debut as a cartoon in The New Yorker by the late Charles Addams, then as a TV series in the mid-1960s, and in two early 1990s movies starring Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd and the late Raul Julia. \nMcGhee said this Broadway musical adaptation reflects many characterizations from “the black-and-white TV show,” which he enjoyed watching while growing up. \n“I don’t know why I liked it,” he said, engrossed by the “silly” nuances of the family and loving the back-and-forth capers between Wednesday Addams and brother Pugsley. \nScary strolls span parts of the Grand Strand as well, including the “Haunted Forest,” a benefit for Help 4 Kids/Backpack Buddies, which based in the Forestbrook community, relays food to needy children across Horry County year round. This forest, open 6:30-11 p.m. daily through Nov. 1, is reached through the Broadway Grand Prix parking lot, behind Hollywood Wax Museum, on 21st Avenue North Extension in Myrtle Beach, west of U.S. 17 Bypass. \nTracey Stillwell, coordinator of the Haunted Forest, talked of the teamwork the past few months to plan this venture, also with help from neighboring property owners. She said several weeks were spent carving the path through woods “as thick as you could get,” then the record rainfall from Oct. 2-5 brought floods, delaying the forest opening for 8-9 days. \nThis attraction, geared only to individuals 10 and older, takes about 25 minutes through which to walk, Stillwell said, “in a really deep, dark swamp forest” full of live characters including “old school” classics: Jason from “Friday the 13th” movies, Freddy Krueger from the “Nightmare on Elm Street” cinematic series, and a visit to a jail cell with Hannibal Lecter, a character from “Silence of the Lambs” for which Sir Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for Best Actor. \nStillwell said she has been involved with designing haunted forests in several other states, but that for this Myrtle Beach outing, she’s happy so many people are taking part in a bigger picture to assist Help 4 Kids, for which everyone coming out to walk this forest is encouraged to being nonperishable food donations, especially this Monday and Tuesday. \nOn those two days, gifts of Vienna sausage, canned ravioli or pasta (pop-top), peanut butter crackers, and chicken noodle soup, will bring a double benefit with each paid admission. Stillwell said such patrons will be welcome to walk through the forest for twice the fright in one night. \nContact STEVE PALISIN at 843-444-1764. \nFAMILY FARE \nArea trick-or-treating \nWHEN: All on Oct. 31 – \n▪ 3-5 p.m. at The Hammock Shops Village, on U.S. 17 in Pawleys Island. 843-235-6355 or www.thehammockshops.com \n▪ 4:30-6:30 p.m. at Broadway at the Beach in Myrtle Beach, with fireworks at 8 p.m. 843-444-3200, 800-386-4662 or www.broadwayatthebeach.com . \n▪ 5-7 p.m. at Barefoot Landing, on U.S. 17, on south end of North Myrtle Beach.
