Daisy Ridley and John Boyega in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Star Wars/YouTube/PA) \nThe upcoming movie also beat previous 007 movie Skyfall and Fifty Shades Of Grey. \nMany fans in the UK were left frustrated after some cinema websites crashed and struggled to cope with the high demand when the tickets went on sale on October 19 at 8am. \nIn the US, American website Fandango said the film has sold more than eight times as many tickets on its first day of release as the previous record holder, 2012′s The Hunger Games. \nThe advance sales coincided with the release of the full trailer for the seventh Star Wars film, unveiled two months before the film hits cinemas. \nThe trailer – which debuted on US television at half-time during an American football game between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia and was also released online – opens with Daisy Ridley’s character Rey and John Boyega’s Finn questioning their places in the galaxy, before new antagonist Kylo Ren, played by Girls star Adam Driver, promises to finish what Darth Vader started. \nThere are also glimpses of the stars of the original trilogy, with Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Peter Mayhew’s Chewbacca appearing, as well as a fleeting glimpse of Carrie Fisher as Leia. \nMissing from the footage is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, but there are sweeping shots of the Millennium Falcon, Stormtroopers and plenty of action accompanied by a soaring score. \nDirected by JJ Abrams, the film is a continuation of the saga created by George Lucas and is set 30 years after Star Wars: Episode VI – Return Of The Jedi. \nIt also stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels and Max von Sydow.
