Why? Because he’s the most interesting man in the world, of course!\nThe parade has been in existence since 1975 , created by puppeteer and mask-maker Ralph Lee. Initially, it was just a short neighborhood walk for Lee’s kids and a few others, but after two years, it became a citywide hit. While once scrappy, it’s now attended by more than 2 million spectators every year.\nBut it's also expensive to operate: In 2012, it struggled with financial problems after canceling due to Hurricane Sandy, and they were forced to use a Kickstarter campaign to keep the Day of the Dead alive for 2013.\nThough the parade doesn’t always have a grand marshal, in the past it’s been hosted by Gene Simmons, Kelly Ripa, and Whoopi Goldberg. They’ve also invited a young boy whose family was displaced by Hurricane Katrina, and they welcomed Carnival artist Didier Civil from Haiti to lead in 2010.\nThey even asked Audrey, the giant flytrap puppet from Little Shop of Horrors , to host back in 2003.\nBut this year’s choice represents perhaps the strangest of all grand-marshal choices. Bronx-born actor Jonathan Goldsmith (that’s “the Most Interesting Man”'s real name) has been starring in Dos Equis advertisements since 2011 — but before his self-proclaimed “overnight success” he was an extra in a few television shows and later taught theater at Adelphi University in Garden City, Long Island, the Post reports . For much of his life he was living in the Sierra Mountains, living on a sailboat in the Marina del Rey.\n“We are thrilled to have Dos Equis involved to keep this great NYC tradition alive,” Fleming told DNAinfo .\nHe “embodies exactly what this parade is about – mystery, intrigue, and of course, interesting,” parade director Jeanne Fleming told the Post .\nEverything needs a sponsor these days, but this does seem like a new frontier of product placement. It's hard to reach those seen-it-all young consumers these days!\nSo just how much is Dos Equis paying to turn the Greenwich Village Halloween parade into a branded revelry moment?\nFleming didn’t specify when reached for comment, but she did add that there is \"a large Day of the Dead contingent in the Parade this year ... so Dos XX was a good fit to work with.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/729950056/bring-halloween-back-to-nyc", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/22/village-halloween-parade-about-to-get-a-lot-more-interesting/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukpcHAX5BZM", "https://www.halloween-nyc.com/theme.php", "http://www.playbill.com/news/article/little-shops-audrey-ii-named-grand-marshall-of-greenwich-village-halloween--115722", "https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151023/greenwich-village/most-interesting-man-world-is-halloween-parade-grand-marshal"], "published": "2015-10-24T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:21:06.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
