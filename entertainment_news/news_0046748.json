Team captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton bound back for the 50th run of the series, which has been appearing regularly on BBC screens now since 1990. They will find a domestic political climate much changed since the spring, now that the Conservatives have settled into majority government and the Labour opposition has undergone a transformation. But it may prove quite a feat for them and their guest participants to find a humorous edge to many of the current world affairs stories. \nThe Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice (BBC2, times vary) \nJo Brand looks back at Wednesday's semi-final, remembering the highlights and presenting unseen footage from the tent as the four remaining bakers competed for the three places in next week's final. This week the theme was chocolate , and here Jo and her fellow panellists meet the unlucky contestant whose efforts weren't quite good enough to impress Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. They also review the bakers' efforts. What will they think of their signature chocolate tarts? Who rose to the chocolate souffle technical? And whose showstopping 3D chocolate centrepiece was the centre of attention? They also taste bakes brought in by the studio audience and look at photos of cakes sent in by viewers. It makes you hungry just watching it. \nThe Kennedys (BBC1, 9.30pm) \nNew series. Family comedy set in the 1970s, loosely based on the formative years of its writer, Emma Kennedy, here seen as a 10-year-old Star Wars-obsessed tomboy. In the first episode, Emma's aspirationally minded mother is determined to be the first person on Jessop Square to throw a dinner party. Giddy with possibilities, Brenda invites best friends Tim and Jenny, and new neighbours the Palmers for an evening no one will ever forget. Katherine Parkinson, Dan Skinner, Lucy Hutchison, Harry Peacock and Emma Pierson star. \nPatagonia: Earth's Secret Paradise (BBC2, times vary) \nThe documentary offering a glimpse into the rarely seen South American wilderness continues, this time following the path of the relentless wind sweeping east through Patagonia's dry desert. The programme reveals a weird world of maras - a large relative of the guinea pig - and penguins, and witnesses the first faltering steps of baby guanacos - Patagonia's very own camels. Cameras also observe the people who have taken on this inhospitable environment and carved out a home for themselves. \nAlan Carr: Chatty Man (C4, 10pm) \nSarah Millican is a busy bee. If she isn't popping up in her own series or appearing on panel shows, she can usually be heard narrating documentaries - after all, her dulcet tones are difficult to miss. But she's taking a break from her televisual duties, at least for the time being, because she's hitting the road for a new tour which she has entitled Outsider. Her gags can be near the knuckle and not the kind of thing you'd want to take your granny along to see, so it should be interesting to hear what she has to say about it when she drops by for a chat with Alan tonight. The host is, of course, one of British TV's chirpiest characters, so how will he get on with Mr Miserable himself - Morrissey - who is his second guest? We can't wait to find out. \nMusic for Misfits: The Story of Indie (BBC4, 10pm) \nMark Radcliffe presents this three-part documentary series charting the evolution of alternative music. It opens by exploring the origins of the UK's alternative music scene in 1977 with the release of the Buzzcocks' Spiral Scratch EP. It was the first independently produced and distributed release of the era, and launched a revolution in the way bands made and distributed their music. This episode features interviews with performers including New Order's Gillian Gilbert, Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers. \nBBC Music John Peel Lecture 2015 with Brian Eno (BBC4, 11pm) \nBrian Eno is one of the most innovative musicians of his generation. Now, in his talk at London's British Library, he will \"examine the ecology of culture,\" according to a BBC statement. Brian will also \"show how cultural processes confer essential and important benefits on society\". As John Peel played a key part in Roxy Music's breakthrough, Eno didn't have to think too hard about taking part. \"I'm honoured to be invited to do a talk in the name of John Peel, a man who had a profound effect on my musical life and indeed my becoming a musician at all,\" he explains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:44:17.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
