Eateries owned by The Union Square Hospitality Group in the Big Apple will eliminate tipping, reports The New York Times . \nChief executive and restauranteur Danny Meyer told The Times, \"There will be one total, as if you were buying a sweater at Brooks Brothers.\" The Times also says that the menus will signify that hospitality will be factored into dish prices. \nMORE: N.J. eatery offers 'eat what you want, pay what you want' menu \nThe first of the group's restaurants to implement this new system will be The Modern, located at the Museum of Modern Art. The move comes at the heels of New York's recent minimum wage increase for fast-food restaurant employees from $11.75-$15.25. Chief executive and restauranteur Danny Meyer told The New York Times, \"There will be one total, as if you were buying a sweater at Brooks Brothers.\" Meyer, owner of Gramercy Tavern in New York, after his restaurant was named Outstanding Restaurant at the 2008 James Beard Foundation Awards in 2008. Diane Bondareff \n\"Once these changes are implemented, the total cost you pay to dine with us won't differ much from what you pay now. But for our teams, the change will be significant. We will now have the ability to compensate all of our employees equitably, competitively, and professionally. And by eliminating tipping, our employees who want to grow financially and professionally will be able to earn those opportunities based on the merit of their work,\" Meyer said in an open letter on Union Square's web site. \nOther eateries in the Union Square Hospitality Group includes Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Smoke, Jazz Standard, Cafe 2 & Terrace 5 (located in the Museum of Modern Art), Maialino, North End Grill, Marta, Porchlight, Untitled (located at the Whitney Museum), Studio cafe (also at The Whitney) and Green River. \nMeyer says that other New York restaurants will make this change over the course of the next year. \nTake our poll below and let us know how you feel.
