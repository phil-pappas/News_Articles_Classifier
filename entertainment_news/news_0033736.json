Following the arrival of the British songstress' new music video , the folks at Blend TV mixed it with the veteran singer's clip for his 1984 song of the same name and put out the result much to fans' delight. The mash-up called \"Lionel Calls Adele to Say Hello\" was uploaded to YouTube on Friday, October 23. Like the title suggests, the hilarious short clip features Richie calling Adele on the phone, but she immediately hangs up on him when he asks her if it's him she's looking for. Adele's \"Hello\" came out on late Thursday night and was followed by its music video shortly after. Also starring \"The Wire\" actor Tristan Wilds , the sepia-toned clip was directed by filmmaker Xavier Dolan, who explained the concept in a new interview with L.A. Times. \"When I heard the song I saw a story right away. This idea of taking the phone and calling your past,\" he said. \"[The video] is highly unoriginal. The lyrics are 'Hello, it's me' and then you see someone picking up a phone. I'm not good at imagining super-conceptual videos. I just thought it would be nice to have her walk around the house and make phone calls and end up in a forest, with maybe some flashbacks in it.\" \"Hello\" is Adele's first song in three years. It will lead her new album \" 25 \" that's due out on November 20. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:00:06.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
