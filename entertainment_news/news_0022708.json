Comment Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 1:12 PM Updated at 4:54 PM Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 1:12 PM Updated at 4:54 PM Â» Social News Wedding bells will definitely not be ringing again for Rossi ( Joe Mantegna ) on Criminal Minds . After teasing Morgan ( Shemar Moore ) about tying the knot with Savannah ( Rochelle Aytes ) on Wednesday's episode, which is directed by Mantegna, Rossi decides to give him a word of advice. \"Just don't elope,\" he says in the exclusive sneak peek above. As Lewis ( Aisha Tyler ) correctly surmises, there is a story there. And it involves Las Vegas, the King and a particularly egregious spelling of the third ex Mrs. Rossi's name. Watch the video above to get all the details! Criminal Minds airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on CBS. (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)
