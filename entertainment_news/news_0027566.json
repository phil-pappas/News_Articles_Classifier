They danced and jumped on stage as “Downtown” singer Eric Nally flew above belting out the chorus. \nItalian tenor Andrea Bocelli gave pop fans a taste of the classical performing his well-known “Time To Say Goodbye” song. \nUnder a dimmed lighting, Bocelli received rapturous applause from the audience who sang along with him, before he launched into a duet with American singer Tori Kelly. \n“Stitches” singer Shawn Mendes beat out British singers Jess Glynne and James Bay, who also performed on stage, for the Best New Act. Mendes was also an absentee at the show. \nThe sounds of the 1980s were remembered with Duran Duran receiving the first MTV Video Visionary award, which honors “the greatest pioneers in the history of the music video art form”. \nWrapping things up was Grammy Award-winning singer Pharrell Williams, who got the crowd on their feet performing his track “Freedom”. \n(Reporting By Marie-Louise Gumuchian in Milan; Editing by Eric Walsh ) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:58:42.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
