Other times, it's glaringly obvious. This time, however, we're not sure.\nNASA has recently begun uploading photographs from its Moon landing missions to Flickr in high-quality, unfiltered images and they truly are stunning to look at.\nHowever, this particular image seen below, has people quite perplexed. For one, the formation is somewhat alien in that it probably harkens back to a time when there were, quite possibly, active volcanos on the surface of the Moon.\nOthers, however, are seeing a half-hidden human face in the formation.\nTake a look and see for yourself. Click on the image for the full-size image on Flickr.\nFor whatever reason, that lone foot-print is kinda spooky.\nIn any case, conspiracy theorists are raving on about ancient Moon civilisations and so on, but we think it's just a rock formation and our own brains seeing a face.\nWhat do you think?
