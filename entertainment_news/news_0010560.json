We travel to Cornwall to take a gander around the places that inspired Kate Morton's new book, The Lake House. \nPT13M34S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-44gb7 620 349 October 13, 2015 - 4:21PM Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings From her first published novel,  The Shifting Fog , Kate Morton has drawn readers with her suspenseful mysteries in which dark secrets echo through time to doom families.\nNow the Queenslander has achieved a major milestone in her ever-blooming writing career. \nOn the eve of the launch of her fifth period drama,  The Lake House , publisher Allen & Unwin has announced Morton's four previous titles have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\nThe best selling Australian author, Kate Morton. Photo: Davin Patterson \nHer galloping sales makes Morton one of the nation's biggest publishing exports.\nAdvertisement As a point of comparison the late Colleen McCullough sold 30 million copies of  The Thorn Birds  in paperback alone while Marcus Zusak's  The Book Thief  has sold more than 8 million copies internationally.\nEach of Morton's books have cracked The New York Times bestselling list:  The Shifting Fog  was published internationally as  The House at Riverton  when she was just 29. Then came  The Forgotten Garden  (2008),  The Distant Hours  (2010) and  The Secret Keeper  (2012).\nThe Lake House by Kate Morton \nMorton will be guest of honour at a party held by her international publishers at the Frankfurt Book Fair this week. She says she is grateful her books have found a readership and, as she begins her sixth book, feels much more comfortable fronting up to the blank page.\n\"You get better knowing at which ideas belong together, and whether you are going in the right direction and having a day of, for want of a better word, writers' block,\" she says. \"That doesn't trouble me or make me panic the way it once would have because I have the tools now.\n\"I know that [feeling] passes and when you hit that stumbling block it's because there is a knot you need to untangle.\"\nâ€‹For many newspaper critics, Morton's books have never quite bridged that tricky gap between genre and literary fiction.\n\"I like it when they're positive, but I'm quite comfortable with differing opinions on my books,\" she recently blogged. \"That's one of the wonderful things about life, we're all allowed to like different things.\"\nThe only reviews that makes her feel exasperated are those where the critics either give too much of the mystery at the heart of her novels away or hold her books to a set of expectations she has never tried meeting.\n\"It's a little like criticising a meal at a French bistro because it didn't look or taste like Italian food,\" she said. \"Pointless and nonsensical and, worst of all, no help to readers.\"\nWhat matters to her is the integrity of the fictional worlds she builds, a process she compares to designing a house that starts first with architectural plans, then the built walls and roof.\n\"If it feels flimsy or pretend, like I'm going though the motions, I lose faith in the project very quickly,\" she says. \"I need it to come to life for me to be fulfilling.\"\nFor the full interview with Kate Morton read Spectrum Books, October 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:26:16.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
