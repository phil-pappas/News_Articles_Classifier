Runs Friday until Nov. 28. \nWHERE: Elektra Theatre, 300 W. 43rd St., second floor. 866-811-4111 or boogiestomp.com. \nHOW MUCH: $39 to $99. \n\"My good wishes are less than frugal, For him who started the little ones going boogie-woogal,\" groused Ogden Nash. \nWhat the dean of light poets was complaining about — in his patented Nash-ese — was, of course, boogie-woogie. \nBy the 1940s and '50s, this raucous school of blues piano, with its insanely repetitive left-hand, had graduated from barrel houses and honky-tonks to the top of the hit parade (\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\"), to the Museum of Modern Art (\"Broadway Boogie-Woogie\" by Dutch abstract artist Piet Mondrian) and finally to suburban living rooms, where it replaced \"Chopsticks\" as the chief weapon favored by young piano students to torture their elders. \n\"Boogie-woogie kind of has a bad name in some places, because people have heard bad imitations,\" says Arthur Migliazza, who along with Bob Baldori is one of the keyboard aces of \"Boogie Stomp!,\" a two-man show written by John Campana that is moving to Times Square for a month-and-a-half stay. \n\"When it's done correctly, there's nothing like it,\" Migliazza says. \"When you're in the groove, it just creates its own energy. It uplifts not only me, but everybody listening to it.\" \nBut Migliazza and Baldori, partners in keyboard crime, have something more in mind than a good time — though \"Boogie Stomp!\" is definitely that. \nTheir point is that boogie-woogie is the very backbone of American popular music, from as far back as the 1920s. In particular, it's the very essence of rock-and-roll, which in its earliest, most basic form is boogie-woogie. \n\"Boogie-woogie is just one of the names they call this stuff,\" Baldori says. \"What it really is is rhythm improvisation and syncopation over the blues.\" \nThese guys know their stuff. Baldori is a veteran musician who has played with Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker and Hubert Sumlin, and for decades has been Chuck Berry's keyboard player (replacing the famed Johnnie Johnson, who died in 2005). Migliazza, a youngster at 35, was tutored by the late piano ace Ann Rabson (Saffire — The Uppity Blues Women). \nBoth have been obsessed with boogie from boyhood: Baldori, originally from Michigan, heard it on his grandfather's player piano back in the 1940s; Migliazza, from Washington, D.C. (he now lives in Hoboken), got the bug from his piano teacher. The two, representing successive generations of keyboard wizardry, met five years ago on what Baldori calls the \"boogie circuit\" and have been making beautiful music ever since. \n\"We're like brothers, we really fit together,\" Baldori says. \"It's been cool working with him.\" \nIn their 100-minute show, with intermission, Baldori and Migliazza take audiences on a pop music tour that begins back at the turn of the 20th century, when itinerant black pianists would shuttle between logging camps and turpentine mill towns in Texas and the Southwest, entertaining on tinny pianos at tumble-down saloons known as \"barrel houses.\" \n\"One explanation is that they were referring to the liquor that was stored in the barrels,\" Baldori says. \"The other is, the houses were made of broken-down barrels turned into saloons. I'm not sure which is the most accurate.\" \nThe propulsive dance music they played, probably inspired by the freight trains in which they hopped from town to town, was boogie-woogie (\"booga\" is a Mandinka word meaning \"to beat\"). \nMost boogie-woogie, then and now, tends to remind listeners of a train: One of the most famous boogie compositions, \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\" by Meade \"Lux\" Lewis, actually mimics the sounds of the train bells and whistles. \"No question that the rhythm of steam trains was a big influence,\" Baldori says. \nIn the course of the show, and with the help of slides and multimedia aids, Baldori and Migliazza demonstrate how boogie seeped into mainstream culture: first in recordings from people like George and Hersal Thomas (\"The Fives,\" 1922, \"Suitcase Blues,\" 1925) and \"Pine Top\" Smith (\"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie,\" 1927), then into the swing era with Count Basie, Lionel Hampton and the Andrews Sisters, reaching its high noon in the recordings of four fabulous piano aces: Lewis — already mentioned — Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson and Jimmy Yancey. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:48:36.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
