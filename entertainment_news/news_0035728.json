He was 70.\nKlein died of natural causes in Palm Springs, California, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department of Coroner.\nKlein, whose clients also included Merv Griffin and Elizabeth Taylor, had an outsized role in Jackson's life.

Whenever I could, I prevented it, but I'm only one man, and I have to support my own life and take care of myself.\"\nKlein was often in the public eye. Born in the Detroit area, he moved to Southern California in his 20s and opened a practice in Beverly Hills. According to a profile in Vanity Fair , he soon became known as the \"King of Lips\" for his expertise with collagen fillers.\nHe was accused of contributing to Jackson's medication problems but was cleared by federal agents.
