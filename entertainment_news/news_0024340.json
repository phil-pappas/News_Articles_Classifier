They’ve also reworked au courant hits, all mashed up with “The Boxer,” including Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky,” Rihanna’s “Diamonds,” Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’“Thrift Shop” and Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood.” \nGarfunkel's cameo now makes two recent late-night live appearances — separately — by the members of the Grammy-winning duo formed in the 1960s. \nPaul Simon joined Stephen Colbert during the opening week of his new job as host of CBS’“The Late Show,” ostensibly as part of Troubled Waters, promoted ahead of the performance as “the world’s greatest Paul Simon tribute band.” \nThey sang Simon’s solo hit “Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard.” \nFollow @RandyLewis2 on Twitter.
