This roundup features the country's smaller cities, with populations under 150,000.”\nThe Conde Nast readers picked Savannah for the No. 5 spot on the list of the Top 15., sandwiching us between Telluride, Colo., at No. 6 and Aspen, Colo., at No. 4.\nHere’s what they had to say about our fair city: “Postcard-worthy Savannah has no shortage of snappable views. Stroll along its cobblestoned historic district past horse-drawn carriages, ornate architecture (and haunted buildings) or find shade under live oak trees drooping with Spanish moss. Book well in advance for your pick of luxury at The Gastonian, an upscale historic bed and breakfast just two blocks from 30-acre Forsyth Park. And for a fantastic dining experience, go to The Grey, a former Greyhound Bus depot elegantly reborn...as a James Beard best new restaurant nominee.”\nSavannah also beat Naples, Fla. (No. 15), Napa, Calif. (No. 11) and Asheville, N.C. (No. 9).\nBut we’re not No. 1. That honor went to Charleston, S.C.\nSee the entire list here", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Savannah_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Savannah_1.jpg", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-10-08/top-small-cities-in-the-us-readers-choice-awards"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:05:41.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
