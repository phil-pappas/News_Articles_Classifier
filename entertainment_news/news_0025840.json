Scott’s “The Martian,” which demonstrates the value of improved 3-D skills and better writing, is based on a scientifically semi-accurate 2011 novel by Andy Weir adapted by Drew Goddard. It is a rousing outer-space adventure, pointing the way to the next frontier, and every bit as good as the recent Academy Award-winner “Gravity.” In opening scenes, astronaut botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left behind on Mars because his fellow Ares 3 team members, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pena), technician Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), engineer Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie) and co-pilot Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), honestly believe he has been killed during an emergency evacuation. Listen to “Mars” from Gustav Holst’s Planets Suite and get in the mood for “The Martian.” I can’t wait to see it again.\n“SICARIO”\nRated R.\nGrade: A-\nA “Traffic” for these times, “Sicario” — we are told in captions — means “hit man.” In the arguably futile war against drugs and ever-expanding, ever more violent Mexican drug cartels, maybe everyone­ has to be a hit man, including FBI agent Kate Macer (a standout Emily Blunt), who is divorced with no children and has a new partner named Reggie (Englishman Daniel Kaluuya), an Iraq veteran. When hostage expert Kate and Reggie impress the feds during a raid on a house in Arizona where the walls are lined with corpses with plastic bags tied over their heads, Kate, who takes out a gang member toting a 12-gauge, is asked to “volunteer” for another operation. It is run by Matt (Josh Brolin), who may or may not be a CIA “spook,” and a burly, mostly silent and jumpy mystery man named Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), who is known to some as “Medellin.” French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (“Incen­dies”) scores with this powerful, crime drama scripted by “Sons of Anarchy” veteran Taylor Sheridan (the studio has already announced a sequel).\n“ THE WALK ”\nRated PG.\nGrade: B-\nAt times visually stunning but otherwise mediocre, “The Walk” is a fictionalized account of the historic if also illegal walk French tightrope artist Philippe Petit took in 1974 between the now lost twin towers of New York City’s World Trade Center. The destruction of the towers­ on Sept. 11, 2001, is a wound that still aches, and this film is a stirring reminder of this lingering pain. A game but miscast and badly wigged Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the Ile-de-France-born Petit. While Gordon-Levitt’s French sounds admirable to these ears, his accent sounds like Peter Sellers­’ immortal Inspector Clouseau. Petit, also channeling Charles Chaplin, narrates this whimsical tale from a perch high up on the Statue of Liberty, with the twin towers, or a digital painting of them, poised majestically in the background. Petit reminds us more than once in this film, co-written by groundbreaking director Robert Zemeckis (“The Polar Express”) and newcomer Christopher Browne and based on Petit’s book “To Reach the Clouds,” that for him the high-wire act is not a brush with death, but it is life itself, a typical example of this film’s canned sentimentality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:40:40.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
