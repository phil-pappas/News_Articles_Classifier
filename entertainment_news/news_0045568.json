Trustees are to vote Tuesday.\nHe called Hall a \"vibrant, loyal alum\" who will add \"a new dimension\" to the 36-member board.\nHall grew up in Texas and joined NBC in 2007. She currently hosts an hour of the \"Today\" show.\nIn a story in the school's magazine, she says Temple \"gave me my confidence.\"\nCosby resigned from the board in December following renewed allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted women over many years. He's never been charged with a crime.\n___\nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:27:14.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
