Steven Spielberg, naturally.\nThe man himself and movies he executive-produced and/or directed — including Indiana Jones flicks, Back to the Future and The Goonies — find their way into the story of a kid in the near-future who’d rather spend time in a cyber-landscape than his the near-future dystopian world around. He goes on a quest in an online video game to find a life-changing treasure, wading through the culture that was an obsession of the game’s creator.\nUSA TODAY\nSpielberg builds A ‘Bridge’ to Cold War era\nSpielberg says it's “very trippy” to be an influence on himself in a way, “but I’m not making this movie to remind people of my ‘80s movies. I may leave most of them out!”\nInstead of being attracted to the wheelhouse he helped build in the past, Spielberg liked Ready Player One because of how it looked ahead and imagined how society will gets its entertainment, maybe sooner than later.\nErnest Cline's \"Ready Player One\" novel explores a virtual world that others use to escape a dystopian existence. (Photo: Broadway Books)\nThe director explains the movie, which will begin filming in June for a Dec. 15, 2017 release and has cast Olivia Cooke ( Me and Earl and the Dying Girl ) as its female lead, is “a crystal ball into exactly what is going to be happening not in 30 or 40 years but in between 5 and 10 years from now, where a virtual world becomes almost like a drug of choice and where we are spending more time in a nonorganic space than we are breathing and eating and interacting in real life.\"\nSpielberg sees it in his own existence often, when his kids bring friends to the house.\n“They socialize for about a half hour, and it gets very quiet,” he says. “I walk into the kitchen and eight or nine girls are sitting around and they’re all looking at their phones, Snapchatting and texting and Twittering and reading. It’s all become so introverted.\n“This movie is going to show why it’s interesting not living in the real world but what we’re missing by not,” Spielberg adds. “It’s a cautionary tale but it’s also a big rockin’ adventure movie, too.”\n18 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1RBdfRl TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b33d303fe5aaa681024b49b940017a0eee3f734e/c=0-854-3251-4105/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796374309660646-XXX-STEVEN-SPIELBERG---BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-PORTRAIT-TP-76350664.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f10bc625af0e725a444098f86cb41c51fbbe8fe9/c=0-631-3825-5731&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796424175224295-XXX-STEVEN-SPIELBERG---BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-PORTRAIT-TP-76350508.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796424175224295-XXX-STEVEN-SPIELBERG---BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-PORTRAIT-TP-76350508.JPG", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZYbPyojQlM?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe5c78ecf349ee43a678323b0d4348cd3db5a2ec/c=0-337-1549-2403&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796425280803382-Ready-Player-One-cover.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796424175224295-XXX-STEVEN-SPIELBERG---BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-PORTRAIT-TP-76350508.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RBdfRl&text=Steven%20Spielberg%20is%20ready%20for%20%27Player%20One%27&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1RBdfRl", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RBdfRl&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:00:32.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
