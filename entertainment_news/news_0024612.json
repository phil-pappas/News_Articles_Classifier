Mark Knopfler did not perform the tune Friday night during his exceptional two-hour show at the Orpheum -- nor was it missed.\nThe 66-year-old singer/songwriter/guitar whiz and his eight skilled bandmates wowed a capacity crowd with a masterful run-through of songs from his eclectic 23-year solo career and his Dire Straits days. Knopfler is in the final stretch of an 86-date tour for his latest album, \"Tracker,\" and it's clear he and his band are at the top of their game.\nThe band must've been \"saving it up for Friday night,\" as Knopfler sings in \"Sultans of Swing.\" The level of musicianship was off the charts.\nThe Dire Straits songs, of course, drew the loudest cheers. The aforementioned \"Sultans of Swing\" was a blast. With the band trimmed to a combo of four (Knopfler, bassist Glenn Worf, drummer Ian Thomas and former Neil Diamond guitarist Richard Bennett), the hit was jazzed up a bit, with Glasgow native Knopfler coaxing gorgeous, rocking Hank Marvin-like sounds out of his red-and-white Stratocaster.\nEven better was the timeless fractured romance story-song \"Romeo and Juliet,\" during which the audience sang every word. Nigel Hitchcock's sax intro and outro set the mood, aided by Jim Cox's \"Whiter Shade of Pale\"-like organ, but it was Knopfler's strong vocals and his powerful-yet-subtle playing on a resonator guitar that made it special. The crowd jumped to its feet and roared its approval at the song's conclusion.\nThe band proved to be adept at several styles of music, often within the same song. A nearly 20-minutes-long \"Marbletown,\" during which Knopfler introduced his bandmates and let each show off, was marvelous. John McCusker stood out, adding a rousing country hoedown fiddle to the mix while Whorf was immense on double bass. The two later transformed fiddle and bass into a classical music piece. Cox added cocktail jazz piano, Michael McGoldrick played Tull-like flute and tin whistle, and Guy Fletcher alternated between keyboards and guitar. Knopfler's guitar anchored the tune, and the song really rocked. It was amazing.\nAlso amazing was a early-in-the-show \"Privateering.\" McGoldrick's haunting uilleann pipes set the mood while violin, a bowed double bass and Knopfler's feisty playing, first on an acoustic folk guitar and then on his favorite Strat, guided the tune to a thrilling climax. The tale of life at sea also showed that Knopfler is a seriously underrated songwriter.\nThe main set ended with guitar showcase \"Speedway at Nazareth.\" A straight-ahead version of Dire Straits' \"So Far Away\" and \"Going Home,\" the theme from the film \"Local Hero,\" sent the crowd home happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:56:12.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
