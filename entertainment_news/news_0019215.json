Photo: Lucasfilms \nIt was, she said, her most desperate hour.\nAdvertisement From that vaudeville cliche - a princess tied, figuratively, to a set of Death Star rail tracks, while a black-cloaked Sith Lord glowered menacingly above her, and John Williams tinkled on the piano in the background - sprang a love story for the ages.\nOn the one hand, there was a generation of fanboys (and some fangirls too), who never quite understood why white Alderaan Princess silk, and Danish pastry hair-curls, were so outer space sexy.\nLuke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Photo: Lucasfilm \nAnd on the other, there was Her Royal Highness, Princess Leia Organa, the daughter of Alderaan's Viceroy Bail Organa.Senator, diplomat and woman of action.\nThat love affair came full circle this week as the official trailer for the seventh Star Wars film, The Force Awakens , made its formal debut to an television and web audience almost too big to measure.\nIt contained many things that sent the internet into overdrive, among them a gleaming, chrome stormtrooper named Phasma and a sinister black-cloaked Vader-wannabe named Kylo Ren. They are new characters for an ages-old space saga.\nPrincess Leia ... how to play a smart, tough woman in a largely male galaxy. Photo: Disney/Lucas Film \nBut nothing was more touching, and more personal, than the glimpse we had of a tear-stained Princess Leia, gently resting her head on the chest of Han Solo, the \"stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerfherder\" who won her heart in 1983's Return of the Jedi.\nThree decades later, the young Princess who led a rebellion against oppression, is transformed. She is older, to be sure, and a very different woman, physically, to the slight, almost waif-like figure who stole the Death Star plans and raced across the galaxy in her blockade runner, the Tantive IV, with a Star Destroyer in pursuit, back in 1977.\nAnd that physicality has not escape notice, as columnists and media commentators around the world noted that Princess Leia, who blazed a trail for feminism in the 1970s, is doing it again, by teaching Hollywood that there is a place for older women on the big screen.\nPrincess Leia gets her own 'Star Wars' comic \nAnd to be fair, it is a win. Let's be honest, in a media world ruled by Planet Kardashian, we take wins where we can get 'em.\nBut it's difficult to credit \"the system\" for its courage. In truth, the cultural might of Star Wars itself has simply trumped the shallowness of Hollywood's beauty rule-book.\nMaking The Force Awakens without Princess Leia would have been unthinkable. And re-casting Princess Leia would have been simply impossible.\nWe often talk of Hollywood's action women, of James Cameron and Ridley Scott's great film heroines, Linda Hamilton and Sigourney Weaver and how, in the 1980s, they gave definition to a stronger, smarter type female action hero.\nBut back there in the late 1970s, when women of action looked less like Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley and more like the busty but trusty bikini-clad Charlie's Angels, Princess Leia, with Danish hair curls and a white dress cut to her ankles, was blazing a trail. She was, to give her her due, the big screen's first modern female action hero.\nShe was also, for a generation of boys who sat, mesmerised, in the darkened cloister of cinema seven at the old Hoyts Entertainment Centre on George Street in Sydney back in 1977, our first great love.\nBut the measure of that love is not in the remembrance. Nor in the nerdy mirth of pre-teenage boys and their adolescent crushes on sexy space princesses. It is measured instead by the very profound reaction to her return to the screen, as an older woman, in the new Star Wars trailer.\nWhile some fans applauded the special effects, and others the promise of new lightsaber duels and even more new toys, there were a bunch of lads - let's call 'em the '77ers - who instead reached for a hanky, to wipe away a little man-tear.\nFor there, among the explosions, the clash of lightsabers and the larger-than-life space villains, was Princess Leia, the embodiment of courage and strength in the face of great inhumanity, who, at just 5'1\", and some three decades older, still towers above them all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:27:17.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
