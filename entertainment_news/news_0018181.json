Earlier this year, the group invited 322 new members to join, its largest class ever, and the makeup of the newcomers included more than 23 percent people of color and more than 28 percent women.\n“Chris Rock is truly the MVP of the entertainment industry,” Oscar telecast producers David Hill and Reginald Hudlin said. “Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, documentarian -- he's done it all. He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host.”\nThe 50-year-old Rock responded that “I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars. …“It's great to be back.”\nThe 88th Oscars is Sunday, Feb. 28, at the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center and broadcast on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:34:48.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
