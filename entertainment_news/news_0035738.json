Joshua L. Wheeler.\nThe 39-year-old native of Roland, Okla., suffered a gunshot wound and later died when U.S. special operations troops and Kurdish peshmerga assaulted a compound in Hawija and freed about 70 prisoners from captivity.\nWheeler is the first American soldier to die in combat in Iraq since the U.S. withdrew from the country in 2011. The Pentagon did not identify him by name Thursday due to its long-standing policy to first notify next of kin.\n\"Yesterday, the United States of America lost one of her finest warriors doing what American troops do best -- protecting those who cannot protect themselves,\" Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, commander of the fight against Islamic State, said in a statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of this brave soldier.\"\nWheeler joined the Army as an infantryman and served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, deploying three times to support combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nHe was later assigned to the Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, N.C., and deployed 11 times to Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWheeler's death drew fresh questions about U.S. participation in the fight against Islamic State to aid partners in its ground offensive against the militants. So far, the U.S. has maintained only an advisory and backup role, delivering airstrikes, training and financial support to proxy ground forces.\nBut Thursday's raid put U.S. forces into a fierce battle alongside the Kurds.\nThe goal was to help free captured Kurdish troops known as peshmerga, who have been key allies in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. The Kurds and U.S. believed there were at least 20 peshmerga inside the raided compound, Kurdish and U.S. officials said.\nNo Kurds were found.\nAt least five of the captives were former Islamic State militants being held as traitors, officials said. The Pentagon confirmed that more than 20 of the captives were members of the Iraqi army. The raid lasted about two hours.\nWheeler was wounded amid the firefight at the compound and was taken back to a northern Iraqi airfield in Irbil, where he later died.\n(c)2015 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742558&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742558", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742558&h=Army+identifies+US+soldier+killed+in+Iraq+raid"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:02:54.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
