Bush assists in actual surgery at an out-patient medical facility in Los Angeles News Archives International, used with permission Representatives for Grand L. Bush announced today that the former Hollywood actor has signed with Echo Tech Imaging Center , a Southern California-based company. Bush joins a decorated team of highly-skilled diagnostic medical sonographers, hand-picked to provide hospitals, out-patient medical centers, doctors’ offices and community clinics with state-of-the-art ultrasound services.\nBush’s foray into the medical industry and tech culture developed after he appeared in more than 100 stage, television and film productions. He is best known for the memorable roles he played in such big box-office draws as \" Licence To Kill ,\" \" Die Hard ,\" \" Colors ,\" \" Lethal Weapon ” and \" Lethal Weapon 2 .\" By putting his acting career on hiatus, the scholar was able to graduate from medical school in 2010.\nBush recently accepted a contract with Echo Tech Imaging Center, after receiving notable certifications from the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers and demonstrating his high-tech skills in person. Bush said his hands-on knowledge of ultrasound technology was strengthened and opportunities expanded, due to the work he was able to accomplish as a volunteer.\n\"When I volunteered at Keck Medical Center of USC in the radiology department, I had little notion it would lead to a practicum in the vascular unit,\" Bush said. \"There is also a joy in participating in health fairs in various communities. In volunteering my skills for the Buena Park Health Care Fair, I was able to help provide free cerebrovascular screenings to an important age demographic.\"\nBush, recognized as one of James Bond 's greatest on-screen allies, currently holds disciplines in vascular and abdominal ultrasound sonography. When he is not assisting other medical professionals, the practitioner is training aspiring sonographers, and administering ultrasonic exams on patients, from infants to seniors, at a radiology center in downtown Los Angeles.", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016", "http://www.echotechimaging.com/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097742", "http://www.ardms.org/Pages/default.aspx", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094894", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097733", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005598/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093409"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:01:07.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
