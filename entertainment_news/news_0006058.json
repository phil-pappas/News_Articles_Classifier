For 2 years and 26 days I have given my life to staying clean from narcotics and alcohol, and trying to repair the damage I have done. By no means has it been an easy journey, in fact it has been the hardest thing I have done. It was hard detoxing, but a small price to pay. What has been the hardest is admitting that despite everything pointing to me having a problem, I didn’t realize the extent of it. Even harder so, was trying to figure out why I chose the path of addiction, what I could and should have done differently and how to fix this path of destruction I created.\nI started drinking and using drugs from the age of 13. When being accepted to arguably the top boys boarding school in the country, I was told I would experience more things then most, to which I added all the bad things I could do to the top of the list. By 14 I was growing my own pot and selling it to the country's elite. Doing this funded me exploring more harder drugs.\nI spent 5 years testing the limits of my chemical intake and wasting a top class education in doing so. The occasional talk and lesson on drugs just made me want to take more, a thought that should have triggered a need to stop, but I didn't care. I didn't care that I was already addicted. I would wax lyrical that addiction was for the weak and the dirty, and I was better than that, all the while knowing that spending a week planning how much I was going to use that weekend and how much money I had to steal to get it was of concern. I took pride in knowing more about drugs than my teachers. I blatantly let them know I knew more in the VERY few lessons on drugs we had (a fact I will come to at a later stage).\nFast forward 9 years after matric and I had thrown away the chance at a tertiary education, thrown away multiple jobs people pulled strings for me to get, thrown away a marriage I was too young to have entered into (I was 21) and I had a strained relationship with my son (Who was 7 at the time). I entered into my first rehab for a cocaine addiction that had been there for 7 years (It progressed from one drug to another before my affair with coke). I went not because I wanted to stop, but rather to make my mom happy as she figured out I may have just had an issue (multitude of things gave that one away). I spent a meagre three weeks in treatment and was “Captain Recovery”. I spent that time saying all the right things and being the poster child for recovery, all the time not believing a word I said and just waiting to get out and use again.\nFast forward another 3 years and I had managed to “control” my use but was drinking like a fish. I had remarried and had another child and from the outside looked like an up and coming citizen of the world. I was drinking a bottle a day, but did not see the problem, as I wasn’t using (often) so who cared about the drinking? My wife did, as she left me for another man of more sober habits. That day I hit the drugs again, and big time.\nMy spiral into oblivion was rapid. Coke turned to Kat which turned to Meth, which quickly turned to heroin. Soon I was back living with my parents. I lost my job but would dress up for work and either spend the day in a Meth den, bar, sex club or hiding passed out around the corner in my car. I would rip off dealers, sell to children and steal from my friends and family.\nEventually my family wrote me off, gave me money and sent me on my way. I landed up in Durbs. I used a friend for as long as I could until he kicked me out, then I went to the South Coast. I lived on the streets for a while and worked as a sex worker for the large gay community there till I could get into a hotel, which I defrauded.\nOne night I had too much and was drifting in and out of the real world and make believe. I couldn’t take the life any more and I slit my wrist 19 times in a hope to end it. I was found bloodied and passed out in the shower. The next few hours where a blur but I was stitched up and put into the psych ward in the local government hospital.\nOne would think this would have been rock bottom, but I carried on using for a couple of days still, smoking Nyope and crack with the gangs in the bathroom. It was only a little while later that rock bottom's basement opened in full view. The psych ward was shared with the terminal AIDS and TB patients. I watched a 8 year old child take his last breath, and lie dead, uncovered, and alone. That was a sign of my future and for the first time in years I prayed for help. I prayed to get clean and get my life back.\nLong story short, a social worker took pity on me and got me into a local long-term rehab. I spent 8 months there learning the tools in life I would need to stay clean and be a productive member of society. I did the 12 Steps like my life depended on it, because it did. I did parenting classes, sexual abuse classes (I never abused but did have some kak things happen to me as a child).\nEventually I came home, and the real hard work started. I had a few days to talk to my mom heart to heart before she died, but still feel too much was left unsaid before she became to weak. I had to try start rebuilding relationships on the back of a death in the family that was partially my fault.\n17 months later and I am re-employed. I pay my debts monetarily to society, but also physically and emotionally now. I head up NA meetings, AA meetings, council at schools and churches. I am remarried and have a relationship with my kids. Of course all is not forgiven and I have a lot to make up for. Just recently I sent a letter to a friend that if he saw me a few months ago would have killed me, apologising for bringing prostitutes into his parents house when I was house sitting when his gran died, who along with me left empty drug packets all over the house, and stole basically everything of value. No words will make up for that.\nI often ask myself how did this all start. How did I let it go so wrong. First and foremost, IT WAS MY CHOICE TO PICK UP, CARRY ON AND NOT STOP. I do however feel that society and the schools played their part. Addiction is not something that is openly spoken about. It is one of those things that society seems to want to ignore till it goes away, and those of us exposed to it don’t realise the end result, nor where to go when we are headed that way. The occasional movie will deal with it and give you a wake up call (Requiem for a Dream), but in whole it is not fully mentioned and drug abuse is depicted as a gangster on a corner, a Colombian Drug lord in a private jet, or as a back page celebrity tit bit. In arguably the countries top school, in 5 years, we had one recovering addict come talk to us, and had 3 life orientation lessons. I offer to give my time up now for free to counsel and tell my story, yet of the 114 schools I offered this to, only three responded, one of which was a no. Teachers are meant to teach the children to stay away from drugs, yet non have any idea (some may say thank goodness) what the drugs look like and what to look out for. I say this to head masters and teachers, should you not bring someone in to educate you , your staff and pupils on drugs, on a constant level, you are doing those children a disservice and inviting people like I used to be, right in to get them hooked. A headmaster recently said to me that to have a drug program at the school would be to admit there is a drug problem, and that is not good for business.\nOver the past few months I have commented on the “Cybershrink” platform to questions relating to addiction (and there are many), and the level of knowledge from the public and professionals is scary. I have noted with interest, there have been no articles relating to addiction that I have seen in over a year. The public is left blind and clueless. So News24, like my services to a school, as a counsellor, I offer these services to you and the public on this site. Use the wealth of knowledge out there, teach parents what to look out for, and show addicts that there is hope and help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:15:41.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
