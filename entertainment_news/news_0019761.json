(Photo: 20th Century Fox)\n9 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is truly squirrelly this year.\nA giant balloon of Scrat, the adorable saber-toothed rodent from the animated Ice Age movies, makes his debut alongside fellow cartoon characters such as Snoopy and SpongeBob SquarePants, loads of marching bands and of course Santa Claus in the 89th incarnation of the annual New York City holiday event Nov. 26. The 2015 Macy’s parade airs live on NBC at 9 a.m. ET/6 PT.\nScrat, which measures 59 feet long, 24 feet wide and 41 feet tall, is bringing another nutty addition to the parade, too, with a balloon of the ever-present acorn the squirrel’s obsessively chasing in the films. Fun fact: More than 15 million actual acorns could fit in Scrat’s oversized snack, which itself is 21 feet tall.\nUSA TODAY\n'Peabody & Sherman' on a musical history tour\n“We’re going to do our best to keep him walking straight down 5th Avenue,” says Chris Wedge, executive producer of the Ice Age movies — including the fifth film Ice Age: Collision Course , in theaters July 22 — as well as the voice of the fan favorite Scrat.\nA New York native who’s attended many Macy’s parades in his 58 years, Wedge grew up loving to watch larger-than-life versions of Mighty Mouse, Underdog, Superman and Snoopy float by, and to have Scrat join this upper echelon of animated characters, “it’s rarefied air,” he says. “I keep pinching myself just to trying to understand that the awareness of the Scrat is as big as it is, and it’s just a silly thing we thought up one day.\n“It’s one of those surreal moments that you never thought you’d witness.”\nScrat and the acorn he faithfully chases made their first appearance in 2002's original \"Ice Age.\" (Photo: 20th Century Fox)\nFirst appearing in the 2002 original Ice Age movie, Scrat is one of the smaller members of the animal cast that also includes woolly mammoth Manfred (Ray Romano), saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo). Wedge felt Scrat would be good to represent the franchise in the parade because he epitomizes the notion that nothing’s easy, in modern days or eons ago.\n“He’s got this Sisyphean thing going on with the acorn, he can just never win,” Wedge says. “He’ll win for a minute but he’s never perfectly satisfied, and that might be a theme for any or all of us through the ages.”\nUSA TODAY\nEmotions run wild in new 'Good Dinosaur' trailer\nThe new Collision Course movie will again feature its animated group humorously trying to survive another cataclysm from the planet’s distant past, Wedge says, and “we’ve created one of the funniest Scrat sequences I’ve ever seen.”\nThe filmmaker is also returning to give life to the little guy’s groans and squeaks: \"As time goes by, he sounds even more frustrated and tired.”\n9 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1RYkenz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1bc2366c3cbe94820e41fb93a76673da442d8ea9/r=500x380/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810620769091019-Ice-Age-Color-Sketch-FINAL.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RYkenz&text=Exclusive%3A%20%27Ice%20Age%27%20squirrel%20to%20make%20Macy%27s%20debut&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d96c54fa461da937f6c21e91d4f46d01d8056010/c=0-14-3300-2495&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810620769091019-Ice-Age-Color-Sketch-FINAL.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810620769091019-Ice-Age-Color-Sketch-FINAL.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8020dabe9fde06d625f9f325c1d203aedce4cd6/c=449-0-1535-1086/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791182422263163-PBD-EP103-01025615-RGB-1-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c7b3565f9aaae24f1fca02978328eea8cd7bcd96/c=243-208-1272-1237/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796958161822868-Good-Dino.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RYkenz", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RYkenz&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bbb0350982735e9614550fcb59fabbf8b08be038/c=467-143-1786-1135&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810620795923191-XXX-E01-SCRAT-ICE-AGE-15-STRIP-1504197.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:54:27.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
