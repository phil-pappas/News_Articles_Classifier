Though they occasionally lost touch and became involved with other people, a visit after the car accident reignited something between them, Lauren wrote.\nThe accident, which killed another passenger, separated Joel’s spine from his head, broke his jaw and robbed him of his ability to speak, NBC News reported . He was placed in a coma while doctors worked to fuse his spine together.\n“As I understand it, the doctors just said, ‘this is as good as his life is ever going to be. Make him comfortable,’” Lauren told NBC.\nBut Lauren continued to visit and they communicated with equipment that relied on Joel’s eyes to operate a computer. They reunited as friends in 2009, leading to their marriage in September 2013. Joel mouthed “I do,” during their vows and Lauren sat on his lap for their first dance to the song I’ll Be by Edwin McCain.\n“But I told him, ‘When you can talk, I want to renew our vows. And when you can walk, I want you to dance with me,” Lauren told Joel.\nOther Stories The horror of MH17’s final 90 seconds News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?

The centre is continuing to work with Joel to help him regain strength and body movement.\nThe couple sells paintings and other artwork that Joel creates on their blog, and they hope to raise money for a home that Joel can comfortably live in. They currently live with his father as neither one has been able to return to work. Prior to his accident, Lauren had studied interior design and Joel had gone to culinary school.\nThis article originally appeared on Fox News.\nOriginally published as Quadriplegic’s first dance with wife", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47d0ba3dcfc7d0e1945efb38c38f5fd8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c425d8e603a72200be1a612f0e2f9ce2", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/quadriplegic-man-shares-first-dance-with-wife-two-years-after-wedding/story-fnq2o7hp-1227568602962?sv=d9fcca5920c298e7df1a5fb66d838df9", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/six-years-after-car-wreck-quadriplegic-man-dances-his-wife-n442811", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_6xkqAK6zY", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29aa8c9e7df2fc3d60f1cedc5efbb1b7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4239c7afe20d17751cdd8315329319d8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0b6982a1678b0da22950bcaee37eaf7c", "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/13/quadriplegic-man-shares-first-dance-with-wife-two-years-after-wedding/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c80d0385f326782e548c83e83205d9f1", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-14T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:13:03.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
