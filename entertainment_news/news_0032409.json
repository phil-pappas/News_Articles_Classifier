John “Jack” Kesner, at the Beaumont Public Safety Memorial on Saturday, Oct. 10. Jack Kesner was one of six honorees added to the memorial during a ceremony on Beaumont Public Safety Appreciation Day. , JOHN M. BLODGETT, FREELANCE PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » Beaumont’s first Public Safety Appreciation Day, held Saturday at the Beaumont Civic Center, combined the third annual Public Safety Memorial Ceremony with the sixth annual Public Safety Fair.\nAbout 125 citizens, dignitaries and public safety personnel gathered at 10 a.m. to mark the addition of six names to the 77 previously inscribed across the memorial’s three slabs of black marble.\nThe memorial honors public safety personnel from the Beaumont-Cherry Valley area who have died in the line of duty or of natural causes. Honorees are selected by a committee that solicits nominations from citizens.\nThe six new honorees are Richard \"Dick\" Franklin, fire management officer/fire chief for U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Desert District and Beaumont Police Department citizen volunteer; Christopher Adam Rojas, a volunteer lieutenant with the Beaumont fire department; George “Al” Pierce, an engineer with Beaumont fire and Cal Fire; Beaumont police Capt. John “Jack” Kesner; California Highway Patrol Sgt. Merrill H. Seyl; and Cal Fire Capt. Richard W. Alexander.\nThe ceremony was followed by a two-hour fair. Chipper, the California Highway Patrol’s mascot, and McGruff the Crime Dog posed for photos with children. A “crashmobile” manned by dummies simulated the body-busting effects of a car crash. Young gymnasts gave a tumbling safety workshop. People chowed down on hot dogs, snow cones and cotton candy.\nA crowd favorite was a “side-by-side burn” narrated by Beaumont Assistant Fire Marshal Richard Horner. Two fake living rooms built of particle board were placed in a back parking lot. Each contained furnishings and a fire alarm, yet only one had a sprinkler. Both were lit on fire simultaneously. The flames in the sprinkler-protected room were quickly extinguished, while those in the other grew into a miniature inferno, billowing acrid smoke, until a Riverside County fire crew turned a hose on it.\nTami Alexander of Prevent Child Abuse of Riverside County, which organized the fair, said combining the two events made both more “poignant.”\nNoting that “safety starts from the top point down,” she said the event shows how public safety personnel are positive role models not just when responding to emergencies.\n“Any time we see police and fire personnel in a non-crisis situation, it teaches children to trust them,” she said.\nIn years past, organizers handed out bicycle helmets, said Beaumont police Cmdr. Greg Fagan, a Prevent Child Abuse of Riverside County committee member.\nThis year, a grant from the Beaumont Cherry Valley Rotary Club — Fagan is president — let them give away kits to collect and store human scents for use in missing person cases.\nFagan said Saturday’s fair seemed to attract more than the typical 400 or so families of previous years.\nJesse Amaya, 34, of Beaumont brought his three young daughters to the fair to learn not to be intimidated by the public safety people they see as authority figures.\nBut they really wanted to play with the rescue dogs.\n“I like the way they’re soft, fluffy and cute and they help people,” said Natalia Amaya, 10.\nContact the writer: community@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw17k3-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch05d.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw17k2-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch05f.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw17k4-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch057.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw17k4-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch059.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw17k4-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch057.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw17k3-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch05b.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw17k3-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch05b.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw17k4-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch059.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw17k2-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch05f.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw17k3-b88534555z.120151010181412000gnuch05d.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:05:44.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
