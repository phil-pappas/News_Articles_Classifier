I am proud to have my own apartment, even though it's a tiny one-bedroom, but I'm not sure where to start with furniture. Should I just get whatever I can that will fit my apartment now, or save up for nicer furniture that eventually could move with me into a bigger house?\n- Maddie A: Congratulations! It's so much fun to personalize a new apartment. And it's great that you are thinking ahead, because furniture is expensive. To get started, prioritize comfortable furniture that will support your life and your health right now. \nYou absolutely need good sleep, so start with the bedroom. What size bed will fit nicely, with room for nightstands on both sides? Even if it's just full size, you can use this bed for guests in a larger house later. \nSpend money now on the most comfortable mattress you can afford and save on the bed itself, which could be just a simple metal frame that keeps the mattress off the floor. Be creative with the headboard by hanging an attractive door or artifact on the wall for a personal look. Finish with at least one nightstand and lamp, and a small bench or extra chair. Save floor space and keep an airy feeling in your bedroom (no dresser) with a closet-organizing system. In the living room, skip a traditional arrangement (sofa, chairs, end tables, and the works), and get a sofa and sturdy coffee table or ottoman that your friends can sit on. Garden stools double as compact end tables, and floor pillows or poufs add flexibility. An inexpensive sofa and area rug that fit your space now will be great for a future child's room or home office later.\nFor dining, a small drop-leaf or demilune table, common in vintage stores, expand for entertaining now, and later will accent a future entry or hall. \nHave fun, and let me know how it goes. \nJennifer Adams is a designer, author, and TV personality. \nTo contact her: AskJennifer@JenniferAdams.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:20:47.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
