The Sunday, October 11 episode was the No.1 program that night, even beating NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\". The AMC show raked in 7.43 rating in adults 18-49 and 14.6 million viewers overall. In fact, it was the biggest rating for broadcast entertainment telecasts in the 2015 fall TV season so far. On Friday, the network will reveal the Live plus-3 rating which is expected to be bigger due to the 90-minute runtime. The season 6 premiere was also also dominating the social media on Sunday. It became a trending topic on Twitter as it received almost 1 million tweets, generating 3.6 billion impressions via 825,000 unique users. It was also the number one show on Facebook. Yet, this season's opener can't compete with the fifth season premiere where Rick and the gang were fresh from escaping the Terminus. The fall 2014 premiere scored 8.65 in 18-49 and 17.29 million total viewers. It remained the show's highest-rated telecast on record. The season 5 finale in March averaged an 8.16 rating in 18-49 and 15.78 million viewers overall. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:11:19.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
