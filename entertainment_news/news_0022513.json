(Yui Mok/PA) \nProducer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has promised that a “mountain of secrets” will be unearthed for the pair before they appear in a spin-off drama that will air as six hour-long episodes on BBC One. \n“Christmas in Walford is always the perfect time for uncomfortable family reunions – and Kat and Alfie’s brief return will lead to tears, laughter … and a mountain of secrets being unearthed for the Slater family,” said Treadwell-Collins. \n“As Kat and Alfie hold on to each other and their marriage, the discovery that Kat has a secret son will lead to seismic waves through the Slaters – and ultimately lead to the Moons realising that the answers to so many questions lie across the sea in Ireland. \n“There’s a lot of story that needs to be played out on screen before they go to Ireland,” he added. “There’s some secrets that we need to explode before that starts.” (BBC/PA) \nSpeaking of their return, 51-year-old Shane said: “I’m really excited to be heading back to EastEnders with Jessie this Christmas. It’s wonderful to be back in Walford and to be playing out several big twists to Kat and Alfie’s story that will set the scene for their new life in Ireland.” Share article \nJessie, 44, added: “I can’t wait to start filming these episodes. The drama that Kat and Alfie have in store when they return to Walford is huge and although secrets will be revealed, more questions will be raised, leading them to head off to Ireland in search of answers.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:00:41.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
