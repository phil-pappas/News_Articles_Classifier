While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\n SO MANY QUESTIONS! He Who Must Not Be Named is gone, so what is causing \"the darkness\"? Why isn't James involved in any of this? And who is returning from Harry's past? Malfoy? A retired Death Eater?\nThe artwork for the play has also been released, featuring a small boy (who looks just like Albus) sitting in a bird's nest with black wings.\nThe official artwork for Harry Potter and the #CursedChild has been revealed: https://t.co/ZN8XJfaytj pic.twitter.com/vhJoGJRJfm\n— Pottermore (@pottermore) October 22, 2015\nMore From Cosmopolitan EVEN MORE QUESTIONS! Why does the Albus look-alike seem so sad? Why does the nest have wings, like a Golden Snitch? What does this all mean???\nSadly, these questions won't be answered until next summer, when the two-part play hits stages at the Palace Theatre in London. Tickets go on sale Wednesday, Oct. 28 to anyone who registered for priority booking and on Friday, Oct. 30 to the general public. No word yet if/when it'll come to the U.S., so time to start saving up for tix to London.\nYou better start practicing your jinxes, because the battle for these tickets will be like the Triwizard Tournament all over again.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/CursedChild?src=hash", "https://t.co/vhJoGJRJfm", "https://www.pottermore.com/news/cursed-child-eighth-harry-potter-story", "http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/movies-tv/news/a34285/harry-potter-the-cursed-child-being-split-into-two-plays/", "https://t.co/ZN8XJfaytj", "http://www.harrypottertheplay.com/", "https://twitter.com/pottermore/status/657271399367757826"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:21:31.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
