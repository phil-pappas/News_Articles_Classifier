And now, actress Deepika Padukone says her character in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's forthcoming film “Bajirao Mastani” is imbued with certain traits of the city.\n\nDeepika Padukone \n“A lot of inspiration comes from Delhi in terms of style and fashion. There are certain things from the film itself and especially my character Mastani, which draws inspiration from the city,” Deepika said at an event here.\nThe actress was speaking at the launch of the film's song titled “Deewani Mastani”, which was unveiled here on Saturday.\nThe film, slated to release on December 18, brings forward a love story of a warrior princess - Mastani, who was the second wife Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I (played by Ranveer Singh). It also stars Priyanka Chopra as Bajirao's first wife, Kashibai.\nDeepika points out that the film is high on aesthetic values.\n“Be it set designs, costumes, jewelry, hair and make-up, a lot of detailing has gone into making the final outcome,” she said.\nThe actress is looking forward to the release of Bhansali's magnum opus as she notes that 2015 has been an “exciting” year.\n“It is an exciting year for me. There was 'Piku' in which I play a role of a simple girl living in Delhi with roots in Kolkata. And now 'Bajirao Mastani' which is a complete contrast. My role in the film is different in all sense. So, it has been challenging and exciting year,” Deepika said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:00:47.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
