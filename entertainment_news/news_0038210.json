Gonzaga University students are there Wednesdays and Thursdays to help with writing or any other subjects, Matson said. And, the center is available as a work place for students other days, too, she said. \nThe center hosts workshops for a range of ages, many in conjunction with arts education nonprofit INK Artspace, with topics like “Be Your Own Superhero,” “Snarky Greeting Cards” or “Write Into College,” helping teens with their college entrance essays. Most classes are free, but have limited spots. The center also has technology available for use, including computers, tablets, high-speed Internet, and the Adobe Creative Suite – all free. \nOn Saturday, the center will be using that high-speed Internet to show “Ratatouille,” the 2007 animated Pixar feature about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. \nAnd Wednesday, Gonzaga students will lead a Pajama Story Time, with tips for parents about how to create an avid reader. Cookies and milk or juice will follow. \nMatson said people are still learning where and what the Spark Center is. \n“There are so many ways they can use this space,” she said. “I’d like to see more people using us as a community space where they can just come and be.” \nKimberly Lusk \nStory time: 9:30 a.m. Wednesdays \nPajama Story Time: 6 p.m. Wednesday \nHomework help: 3:30-5:30 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays \nCenter hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, noon to 5 p.m. Saturday \nWhere: 1214 W.
