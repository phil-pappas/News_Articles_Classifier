I know the Western Carolina University professor will turn up the crusty surface of this unnamed, contemporary town in the N.C. mountains to show us the loam beneath. The loam where, as someone in a small town once told me, everybody is somebody’s somebody.\nMore Information Above the Waterfall\nBy Ron Rash\nHarperCollins, $26.99\nAnd everybody’s somebody in this novel has lived through big-time heartbreak. The main character, Les, a retiring 51-year-old sheriff wrapping up his last week of a 30-year career, lugs the guilt of his hostile indifference toward the suicidal threats of his depressed former wife.\nAnd Becky, a 43-year-old state park superintendent, wary and watchful, still suffers the after-shocks of a gunman who entered her elementary school and killed the teacher whose hand young Becky was gripping. Not to mention Becky’s former boyfriend, a man she didn’t realize was an eco-terrorist, who, “had his timer worked right, would have killed more people than Ted Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph combined.”\nWill Becky and Les eventually give up their “wary out-of-step dance” to find solace with each other? That question will keep you reading.\nBecky and Les alternate narrating the novel. I admit to feeling relief at the return of Les’s voice. Becky’s too-precious “shadow-steeped mold,” and “heart soak of sun and stone” made me claustrophobic.\nNot midway through the novel, Rash creates a restrained and brilliantly-paced scene that alerted me that this novel, like his best-selling “Serena,” is headed for the big screen. It involves a meth bust, a strung-out young couple in a trailer, a microwave, a baby and a deputy who turns in his badge on the spot.\nThe meth bust is one thing. It’s nasty and straightforward compared to the complicated trouble at the heart of the novel: Who is poisoning the speckled trout in the stream at the local fishing resort?\nSuspicion points to old Gerald Blackwelder , a bitter landowner whose response to the news of his 19-year-old son’s death in the Persian Gulf War was to set fire to the house he was building for the son’s return. Becky, Gerald’s arch defendant, maintains he can do no wrong.\nBut Gerald has a nephew, a meth head named Darby, the sole inheritor of the land at Gerald’s death. Is Darby involved? Les, whose emotions rarely take him out of a box step, keeps an open mind.\nThen there’s C.J. Gant , whose daddy “had been a decent farmer but bad to drink.” C.J. went to college, does PR for the resort, owns a nice house in town and drives a fancy SUV. But he wants his two sons to have a better life than he did. Could he be involved?\nI’m not used to reading Rash for the outer rather than the inner mystery. Reading “Above the Waterfall” is like walking a railroad track — the scenery along the way is great, and I’m enjoying the novel’s journey.\nBut experiencing a Ron Rash short story is like entering a cove and being enveloped in the kind of mystery that lodges deep and keeps resonating. That, with the supple beauty of his language in prose or poetry, is his truest and most stunning gift.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/70/8707637/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/70/8707637/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:32:08.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
