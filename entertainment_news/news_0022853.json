The Whitman Mission National Historic Site was established to focus on the history of Marcus and Narcissa Whitman’s mission to the Cayuse Nation in the early 19th century. This Cayuse mission was sponsored by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a Boston group responsible for mission operations around the world. The ABCFM has historically been involved in leading the nation in recognition of Native American sovereignty, the repeal of slavery and restoration of indigenous rights in South Africa. Despite honorable intentions, ABCFM missions in Old Oregon ended in disaster. Measles and other epidemics resulted in widespread death among Native Americans. Each year brought more immigrants on the Oregon Trail who would want native land. The Whitman’s mission was at the center of these tragic changes. In 1847, after a measles outbreak killed half their village, a group of Cayuse attacked the mission hoping to remove the source of their devastation. Fourteen people died including Marcus and Narcissa. As a result of the Cayuse attack, the United States government had another reason to set up reservations and restrict the movement of Native Americans. The events at the Whitman Mission in the early 1800s marked a turning point for Native Americans living on the Columbia Plateau. Through partnerships with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the National Park Service seeks to present the continuing story of the Cayuse Nation and the impact of this early interaction with U.S. immigrants. Museum After Hours is a monthly lecture series held at 5 p.m. March-October and 4 p.m. November-February on the last Thursday of every month. It is a space for community congregation, discussion and debate. The free lecture series touches on topics ranging from regional culture and history to the roles and responsibilities of museums within our community.
