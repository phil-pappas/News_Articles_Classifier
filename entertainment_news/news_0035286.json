The judge granted the request.\nThe one-page document signed by Odom and Kardashian was submitted without prejudice, which means it can be refiled at later date.\nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada. He regained consciousness Friday and was transported to Los Angeles on Monday to recover.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/27/8820160/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/27/8820160/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:15:02.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
