Love to my brother Keano and the Irish squad on a big win today. Got this vid of them listening to #WhatDoYouMean after the win. Love it. \n— Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) October 9, 2015 Here it is. Robbie Keane and the Irish lads listening to #WhatDoYouMean after the victory pic.twitter.com/SsrWOKconw \n— Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) October 9, 2015 \nYep, that one really seems to have got the party started. \nBieber’s a big football fan and has trained with Barcelona and Chelsea. Apparently he’s got a decent tackle on him. \nBut somehow the idea that he’s chummy with former Coventry striker Keane just doesn’t seem quite right, even if the Ireland captain does now ply his trade in the glamorous surroundings of the Los Angeles Galaxy. \nKeane was an unused substitute as Ireland beat world champions Germany 1-0 to give themselves a great chance of reaching Euro 2016. (Brian Lawless/PA) \nAmong Keane’s other musical chums are One Direction’s Niall Horan and Morrissey. Yes – that Morrissey, who is in fact related to the Ireland striker. \nWe can’t see him being a big Bieber fan, somehow. My decision to wake up was just justified by learning that Robbie Keane is a cousin of Morrissey. My head hurts. pic.twitter.com/ndc3jhetnJ Share article \n— Thomas Hobbs (@thobbsjourno) August 21, 2015 Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:11:00.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
