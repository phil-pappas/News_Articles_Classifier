From reports about that episode, we know that the series' action is set in the present day, with many years having passed between the end of the original series and the beginning of the new one. All of the principal actors from the original series have returned, including David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, and Mitch Pileggi as Agent Skinner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:26:02.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
