Gavino Garay reports.   \nOld Havana was treated to a musical duo like none other. Chinese virtuoso Lang Lang and Cuban jazz great Chucho Valdes wowed the crowds under the night sky in a concert dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the Cuban capital. But there was another cultural component.. the direction of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's Marin Alsop.. a fitting touch after Cuba and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations for the first time in over 50 years... Cuba's cultural minister, Julian Gonzalez, stopped short of calling the concert historic. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) CUBAN CULTURE MINISTER JULIAN GONZALEZ, SAYING: \"It was absolutely exceptional, unprecedented, it would be difficult to repeat something of this magnitude here at the Cathedral, in Cathedral Plaza, in this very pleasant environment of Old Havana with its confluence of history.\" Cuban art student Vida Beatriz said the concert struck a chord with her. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) CUBAN ART STUDENT, VIDA BEATRIZ, SAYING: \"I'm a student at the National Art School and, to me, this is marvelous. I don't know how to explain it.\" It was a first of sorts for Lang Lang, not only his first time in Cuba, but his first collaboration with one of the island's most acclaimed musicians.  //reut.rs/1ZpdCng", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:57:17.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
