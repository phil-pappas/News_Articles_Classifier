Mike Groenke Now that it has officially froze (and the growing season is thus over), our warm temperatures this week can qualify as a dose of Indian summer ! We saw temperatures hit the 70 degree mark yesterday and will see that happen again through the end of the work week. Highs today and tomorrow will even push the middle 70s. However, a chance for rain returns for the weekend.\nA weakening front to our northwest will slide ever so slowly towards the Tri-State over the next 24-48 hours. Nothing more than a few extra clouds today is expected from this system. Our mild trend continues tonight with lows only dipping into the middle 50s. The front will get close to Cincinnati on Thursday before washing out. An isolated shower cannot be ruled out mainly north of town, but most locations are expected to stay dry.\nA shift in wind direction will be the biggest influence from the dying front. With winds turning from southwest to northeast on Friday, highs will be just a couple degrees cooler. Clouds will increase late Friday ahead of our next weather maker. A few showers will become possible after midnight Friday night.\nAs moisture streams into the region, a few scattered showers will move through during the day Saturday. With clouds and a few showers around, highs are expected to only hit the upper 60s. A better chance for steadier and heavier rain will enter the picture Saturday evening as a low pressure system moves by and drags a front through. The rain will come to an end early Sunday morning.\nTemperatures will be cooler behind the front on Sunday with highs only in the lower to middle 60s. The front gets hung up just south of the region to start the week before lifting back to the north. This will send another wave of mild air our way and eventually lead to more rain around the middle of next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:17:13.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
