The Electric Jukebox offers a unique plug and play music streaming experience for the home giving access to tens of millions of albums with no monthly subscription or registration requirement.\nSimply plug Electric Jukebox into your television, connect to WiFi and instantly play millions of albums, curated music channels and celebrity mixtapes in CD quality whilst also watching thousands of beautiful visualisers from the extensive image archive of Getty Images. The visualiser experience provides a subtle visual enhancement to the consumer's music experience.\nThe Electric Jukebox makes streaming as easy as playing a CD or switching on the radio.\nFeaturing all the benefits of a premium music streaming subscription service in a box but without the need for a smartphone or a PC, user accounts, passwords, app downloads or monthly credit card subscriptions, makes it incredibly simple to set up and use. Electric Jukebox represents the first Internet of Things music appliance for the home, making on-demand music streaming accessible to everyone.\nElectric Jukebox comprises a dedicated stick which plugs into the HDMI port of your TV and instantly turns your TV into a jukebox with millions of songs to enjoy using WiFi. It also features a beautifully designed gesture based controller with built-in microphone featuring voice control, making it easy to find and play music on your television. Designed to sit on the coffee table and be used by all the family, it's the easiest and most enjoyable way to listen to music at home.  \nIndependent YouGov research* shows music streaming has failed to gain mass market adoption. The most popular ways to listen to music at home are still radio (52%) and CDs and Hifi (42%). Streaming hardware solutions like Sonos are used by only 6% of consumers and more than 92% of consumers have yet to subscribe to any form of music streaming service.\nEJ Curators include Sheryl Crow , Robbie Williams , Stephen Fry and Alesha Dixon  \nTo ensure maximum appeal, Electric Jukebox features exclusive mixtapes from some of music's best loved artists and celebrated curators including British music icon Robbie Williams , his wife Ayda Williams , nine-time Grammy award winner Sheryl Crow , English actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry and Britain's Got Talent judge singer songwriter Alesha Dixon .\nSheryl Crow said; \"I love Electric Jukebox because it brings people together. Listening to music and sharing those experiences together is what life's all about. With headphones and iPhones we've somehow lost all that. Electric Jukebox plugs into your TV and turns it into a jukebox with all the music you want, played out loud in your home for you to listen together. Simple, fun and no fuss.\"\nYouGov reports the four things consumers want to see in order to migrate to streaming are: improved ease of use, a lack of a monthly subscription, improved affordability and easier set up. There is a clear global opportunity to offer consumers a simple and engaging music streaming device.\nRob Lewis , CEO of Electric Jukebox Company commented:\n\"We are bringing music back into people's living rooms. Working with Getty Images we are enhancing the ultimate music jukebox by giving consumers a beautifully crafted and delightful visual accompaniment that enhances their audio pleasure. We are grateful to Getty Images and the thousands of photographers who are responsible for this extraordinary archive. It is also yet another reason not to huddle around a laptop or smartphone to play music, or play old CDs and radio. Mass market streaming has finally become a reality through the ultimate plug-and-play audiovisual experience.\"\n\"There used to be 200 million people buying CDs every month and many more buying CDs occasionally. After ten years of streaming only 40 million have converted to streaming subscription services because of complexity, set-up difficulty and because of the fear of recurring credit card based subscriptions. The Electric Jukebox is the product for the other 160 million music lovers out there who want to join the revolution but have been waiting for something fun, stylish and easy to use\".\nVince Bannon of Getty Images commented:\n\"We are really excited about the experience this partnership is providing Electric Jukebox users. Getty Images has the world's most powerful and engaging imagery, which will provide a rich visual fabric for a musical landscape to weave through - this really is the ultimate music experience.\nHow it works  \nElectric Jukebox comes in two parts; a stick that you plug into the HDMI port of your TV, and a beautifully designed motion sensitive controller with built-in microphone for voice search, the Electric Jukebox Controller.\nOnce set up, the Electric Jukebox welcomes users with a homescreen featuring just three icons; My Music , Discover and Search, each represented by a neon themed icon in the shape of a heart, music note and magnifying glass. Designed to be as intuitive as possible, and much more so than application based downloads, it is easy for the whole family to explore and play music together from the comfort of the sofa.\nThe Getty Images audiovisual experience automatically presents itself to Electric Jukebox users once they have selected music and have put the controller back onto the coffee table.\nElectric Jukebox is available to pre-order from http://www.electricjukebox.com for UK RRP £179 US MSRP $229 (including a free 1 Year Premium Music Pass).
