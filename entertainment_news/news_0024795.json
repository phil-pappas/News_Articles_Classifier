They are expecting their third child, a girl, this fall. The couple are parents to Camden, 3, and Jaxon, 17 months.\nWhen asked if she would allow her children to appear on reality TV, she responded, \"God, I would almost rather my kids play football than do reality TV.\"\n\"'Laguna Beach' was such a great experience but we were so young. I was a junior in high school and we didn't realize what we were getting into. We were thrown into certain situations that were supposed to push our buttons and manipulated situations and it was kind of hard to deal with at the time,\" said Cavallari, who grew up in Barrington before moving to California.\nCavallari, 28, also revealed in the Entertainment Tonight interview she keeps in contact with her \"Hills\" co-stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt, who have portrayed villains on various reality TV shows.\nPhotos of Jay Cutler's wife.\n\"I talk to Heidi all the time, yeah. It seems like she's doing really well and (she and Pratt) are really happy,\" Cavallari said. \"I love that they're still married and they've sort of shut up all the haters, you know?\"\n Kristin Cavallari Jay Cutler Spencer Pratt Chicago Bears Heidi Montag", "external_links": ["http://www.etonline.com/tv/174129_kristin_cavallari_says_she_talks_to_former_hills_co_star_heidi_montag_all_the_time/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56211375/turbine/ct-kristin-cavallari-jay-cutler-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127fe0/turbine/chi-kristin-cavallari-pictures"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:02:43.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
