He said he has spent the last few weeks at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, doing tests ahead of surgery to remove the tumors. \nLesh, 75, said his prognosis is positive.

The San Francisco group disbanded in the mid-1990s and Lesh went on to form his own music group Phil & Friends. At the time of his cancer announcement, his band was touring with Chris Robinson, a singer with the Black Crowes. \nLesh apologized for the nixed Phil & Friends shows on October 24 and 25 with Robinson and promised to reschedule the shows \"as soon as we can.\" \nLesh battled prostate cancer in 2006. He seemed intent on returning to the stage for shows scheduled on the East Coast beginning October 30 in New York. \n\"Keep a lookout for a free Grate Room show before I leave for the East Coast shows,\" Lesh said in the post. \"I also plan to pop in and jam in the bar before we leave, so I hope to see you there at Terrapin.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:00:10.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
