The current account stands to benefit from the downturn in global commodities as it is a net importer of most of these commodities even though exports may continue to contract. \nModified Date: October 4, 2015 12:30 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:29:27.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
