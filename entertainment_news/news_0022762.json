In fact, we'd go as far as to say it's probably one of the greatest things to happen in the 21st century. Unfortunately though, they also have one big downfall: battery life.\nThere's no worse feeling than when an occasion or an opportunity requires your phone to rise to the challenge. Then, when you go to get your phone, the empty battery symbol nightmarishly pops up right in front of you just before it dies.\nIt's happened to us enough times that we now walk around with a mild anxiety whenever our battery dips below 50% so we must remind ourselves that it could be worse. So here's that reminder, in list form, of the worst times you can lose power. We hope and pray you never have to live through one of these moments.\nWhen you're running late for a date\nBeing late for anything without the ability to phone ahead and explain(grovel for forgiveness) is crap, but your mates, and even work will get over it. First dates on the other hand, well, \"you only get one chance to make a first impression, and nobody wants to go out with a spanner who can't keep time\".\nJoyce said that you know..but you won't find it in any of his books!\nWhen you randomly meet your favourite celeb\nSelfies are acceptable in two circumstances, when you meet your favourite celebrity, and...well...OK, selfies are acceptable in one circumstance so, but when you finally work up the courage to ask for a photo, your phone dies, leaving you to A) stand there awkwardly in the hope they'll use their phone and send it on(actually happened to us once), or B) run around frantically trying to find a friend/good Samaritan who'll whip out a functioning phone. Time to start praying.\nYou've met \"the one\" on a night out but can't take their number\nThe way their brunette hair flops down from under that red knitted hat. The way that denim jacket hangs loosely off their shoulder. When you hear their accent and realise it's from South Africa and...sorry, got a bit too personal there. Anyway, whether it's the one, or just the one for that night, you don't want to have that awkward pause where you wait for them to ask for your number instead. What if it never comes? WHAT IF IT NEVER COMES?\nWhen you're at a festival and you can't remember where your mates are camped\nFor us at least, finding friends at festivals is tough enough with a phone, so the last thing we need is to be thrown back into the 1800's and resort to walking around random campsites screaming \"FIOOONN HHH?\".\nWhen you're stuck in the middle of nowhere and trying to Hailo\nThe night/early morning has gone awry and you've somehow found yourself in unfamiliar territory. The place names on signs look like Pig Latin, and the directions coming out of the mouths of locals aren't much better. Who you gonna call? Hailo, of course, or you would have, if you hadn't spent all night blasting Spotify out of it at some house party. Have fun walking in some random direction in the hope of finding civilisation, you'll charge your phone properly next time.\nJust as you come up with the best reply to someone on Twitter\nThey think they're so clever, with their words, and their GIF's, well I'll show them. No, you won't, you'll spend twenty minutes trying to find a charger, by which point you'll have forgotten your comeback, lost in the ether, and the only thing you'll be constantly reminded of that when others RT and Favourite their comment. IT WASN'T EVEN THAT FUNNY!\nWhen you're right in the middle ordering a pizza\nYou're halfway through ordering one pizza with everything but anchovies, and another one with your favourite topping, anchovies, when the constant stream of \"um hmm, um hmm, yep, um hmm\" quickly stops. Has the pizza man finally realised he doesn't have to respond to every single word I'm saying? No, he's just not there anymore.\nYour dog is being insanely cute but you can't video it\nWe don't have kids, so we assume they probably do some cute stuff too, but what we do have are dogs, and we know they're a constant source of 'awwwhs'. But us seeing them being adorable isn't enough, the world needs to know just how amazing they are, but our dead battery is stopping that from happening. Who knows what world problems could be solved if the internet could just see the way Mr. Suger Dunkerton jumps at the sound of his own farts.\nThese are our own selection of the 8 worst times to lose power - we want you to tell us about your own worst time that you lost power & how you could have been saved by a Coca-Cola Power Bank.\nTo enter, leave your comments below this article including #choosehappiness (remember you can also comment using your Facebook account).\nThe overall winner will win a massive €1,500 , with runners up winning a fab Coca-Cola Power Bank , to save you when your charge starts to wane.\nCompetition closes 31st October.\nRead the Rules\nMORE: New battery could keep your iPhone charged for a whole week\nMORE: There are a few surprises in Ireland's list of favourite brands\nMORE: Watch: Handy trick shows you how strong your iPhone signal really is", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:51:50.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
