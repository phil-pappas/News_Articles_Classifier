Photo: Thierry Bal \nBritish architect Amanda Levete pushes boundaries with design for new MPavilion British architect Amanda Levete to design second MPavilion project by Naomi Milgrom Want to know what's new in architecture? Pop-up pavilions reveal things to come The golden rule of success for the head of a cultural institution is simple, according to the director of Britain's Victoria and Albert Museum, Martin Roth.\nFresh from a twice-yearly talkfest of museum directors, he says: \"The amount of construction sites, I mean the amount of projects.\nBritish architect Amanda Levete's design for MPavilion, which opens in the Queen Victoria Gardens on October 5. \n\"Obviously, you're not a good museum director if you don't build.\"\nAdvertisement Roth satisfies that criteria with his multi-million pound Exhibition Road project that will give the V&A's flagship London building in South Kensington a new entrance, underground gallery and courtyard.\nHe says the renovation adds new spirit to the venerable institution founded in 1852.\nAmanda Levete's work \"combines elegance and style and new technologies,\" says V&A director Martin Roth. Photo: Peter Guenzel \n\"That's what I like with your MPavilion idea is that it always adds new ideas,\" he says of Melbourne's pop-up architectural commission initiated by businesswoman and arts patron Naomi Milgrom. (The inaugural MPavilion in 2014 was designed by Australian architect Sean Godsell). \"Whatever the V&A did for 50 years, we didn't try to copy the past. We always try to add something new.\"\nThe Exhibition Road project is designed by London architect Amanda Levete. Her design studio AL_A has also created the second MPavilion .\nThe temporary structure designed to create the sensation of a forest canopy will be unveiled by Roth in Melbourne's Queen Victoria Gardens on Monday.\nRoth is full of praise for the architect whose work \"combines elegance and style and new technologies,\" he says. \"It's also for Amanda it's why I travel all that way to come and see the pavilion.\"\nHe says the MPavilion acts as an incubator of new ideas.\n\"A temporary commission gives a lot of opportunities to show different architects from different parts of the world using new material,\" he says. \"It's more like an idea instead of always setting everything in stone and making for eternity.\"\nRoth will discuss building new cultural spaces with Levete and Milgrom on October 6.\nRoth has built the V&A's profile in Australia through the export of major shows, including David Bowie Is… at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Undressed exhibition at the Powerhouse Museum, Queensland Museum and Bendigo Art Gallery and Inspiration by Design at the State Libraries of Victoria and NSW.\nThe cultural trade is one-way, which Roth puts down to Australia's reverence of Britain and what he calls \"its Britishness\".\n\"That's the link,\" he says. \"It's the same history, the same identity, the same expectations.\nDubbed the James Bond of the cultural establishment in his native Germany, Roth is remarkably genial and slightly indiscreet, which he attributes to the early interview time.\nEarlier in his career, he was a director of the German Hygiene Museum (\"sounds horrible. I know\") in Dresden and staged an exhibition on abortion.\n\"With that exhibition we tried to explain what women had to suffer or were forced to suffer to have no children,\" he says.\nRoth says the show was a success because it touched on areas of public concern.\n\"I think museums, even of art history, play a social role in society,\" he says. \"If you're not committed to things that go outside the museum, people will not understand inside the museum.\"\nSydney's major cultural institutions are in the grips of a building boom , with planning under way to expand the Art Gallery of NSW, renovate the Sydney Opera House and relocate the Powerhouse Museum, among many others – all at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to the public purse.\nBut Roth adds a note of caution about the global boom in cultural institutions.\n\"To build and to open it that's the easiest part,\" he says. \"But the long-term strategy, the future plan that's what you need and that's what makes it complicated.\"\nState and federal museums are also coping with ongoing budget cuts, efficiency dividends and staff cuts.\nBut Roth dispels any notion that Britain or continental Europe is paradise of cultural institutions flush with public funds.\n\"I've always had to deal with budget cuts,\" he says. \"I think since 1990 I had only one year, in 1994, without a budget cut.\n\"It's a strange contradiction that museums are even more striving, they're getting better, there's even more interest but there's less money. It's really crazy.\"\nMPavilion is in the Queen Victoria Gardens from October 5 to February 7, 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:16:09.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
