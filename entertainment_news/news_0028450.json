The recently concluded United Nations Sustainable Development Summit reminded me of valuable lessons I learned years ago from David Werner, a former California high school teacher. This week I describe what David taught me during my time in Ajoya, a small rural village in Mexico nestled high in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains. David saved the lives of hundreds of children through a commitment to public health and ingenious approaches to creating change. His successes can teach us a lot about how to improve American health care in the future. One day, as David led a student trip along the trails in the area to study the flora and fauna of the lush mountain range, he learned that a teenage girl from the village had suffered a life- threatening injury.Because the villagers are poor, most subsist largely on the vegetables they grow and the animals they kill. To trap animals for food, they typically dig a three-foot-deep hole in the ground, fill it with lye and cover it with twigs and leaves. Small animals that run over the spot fall through the deceptive cover and are killed by the powerful chemicals that lay below.Unfortunately unsuspecting villagers occasionally fail to recognize the traps and fall into the lye pit. When they do, the skin of their legs is burned from their feet to their thighs, and nearly all die from infection.As David told me, he applied his knowledge of first aid basics and immediately washed the lye off the girl. He accompanied her back to the village and explained to her family the necessity to keep her wounds clean and make sure they boiled the water they used for the moist dressings they were instructed to apply to her burns several times a day. Thanks to him and his knowledge of sterility, she survived.The villagers quickly embraced David as a \"healer.\" Each time he returned to Ajoya, they sought his help.[caption id=\"attachment_2951\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Photo by Julie Louisa Hagenbuch / CC BY 2.0[/caption] Small Steps Make A Big Difference At the time, childhood mortality in Ajoya hovered at 34%. The main cause was intestinal infection, producing copious diarrhea and secondary dehydration. Children under the age of two, proved most vulnerable. Unable to sustain the massive loss of fluids, most died.The villagers assumed the cause of death in these children to be the collapse of what are called fontanelles, the two soft spots found on the top of the heads of babies under age two. The fontanelles appear sunken when any baby becomes dehydrated.Local healers would be called in to put their fingers in a baby's mouth and push up on the palate. The infants so treated would cry in discomfort, and crying increases the intracranial pressure enough to elevate the fontanelles. But of course this intervention failed to make a difference.David recognized that the real cause of death was dehydration, and that the fontanelle collapse was the result of the massive fluid loss. He set about teaching the mothers of Ajoya the importance of administering sufficient volumes of fluids to children, particularly babies experiencing severe diarrhea. As David explained, educating parents about what they could do saved dozens of lives a year and his reputation as a healer grew dramatically.The village asked him to set up a medical clinic, which he did. A Revolutionary Health System David identified the fundamental problem causing the severe intestinal diarrhea. The water the villagers drank ran through the same pastures where cows grazed, and was contaminated by cow feces. In addition, the village itself had no sanitary facilities for the disposal of human waste. As a result, the very ground where children played was contaminated.David could have waited for grants or sought funding from a variety of sources to address these problems. But he understood it would be hard to obtain such funding, and even if secured, it would be long in coming.So he pursued a different solution.With the clinic built, he established an innovative fee schedule with two main options. You could get care at the clinic if you either paid $50 or volunteered for two hours.Now, most poor, rural villages in Mexico have a few wealthy individuals who own nearly all of the arable land and farm it at great profit, and Ajoya had three such wealthy landowners. Those families chose to pay the fee, thus funding the clinic on an annual basis, while everyone else volunteered. Using the donated labor, David helped the villagers install pipes to carry water from high in the hills, above the cows, to the village below. And together they constructed latrines with similar pipes to carry away the human waste.Almost immediately – even before David introduced equally ambitious vaccination and nutrition programs – early childhood mortality in the little village dropped dramatically. What Community Efforts In Ajoya Can Teach Us The lessons from Ajoya provide valuable insights into how we might address some of the health care challenges we face today in the United States.First, we need to recognize that the greatest improvements in health will come not from how aggressively we treat advanced disease but, rather, from how effective we are at preventing problems in the first place. David could have tried to solve the infectious disease problems he encountered through antibiotics and IV sets, but instead, he addressed the underlying cultural and environmental factors. The outcome, as measured by lives saved, was remarkable.If the frequency of children having intestinal diarrhea could be reduced in Ajoya, we should be able to address the epidemic of obesity and the variety of chronic diseases like diabetes which result.If deaths from dehydration in young children could be decreased through public health measures, we should be able to do a better job of reducing the rate of cigarette smoking in the United States through improved education and the elimination of teenage smoking.And if we apply even a small number of the health care dollars we otherwise would spend on the next biotech drug for diabetes or a new device to facilitate bariatric surgery on these public health measures, the return on that investment would be huge.Second, if David could play such an instrumental role in health care without either an MD degree or sophisticated medical technology, who else – other than physicians and medical professionals – could contribute to solving our national health care problems?Community workers who grow up in the inner cities most in need of medical help in the U.S. today are sometimes in the best position to effectively care for, and improve the health of, the people in those same communities. Although they don't have formal education as health care professionals, the people in many of the inner cities trust them, and they can coordinate transportation, nutrition and communication. Hiring these individuals to go into the homes of individuals most at risk, and connecting them with doctors and nurses through mobile technology, offers a major opportunity to better serve their needs.Finally, David used education as a powerful tool to improve the health of the people of Ajoya. He taught the villagers to boil water before they applied it to the burn wounds, provide sufficient fluids to reverse dehydration and install pipes to protect their water supply from contamination. But once they knew what to do, they became healers themselves, and spread their success to neighboring villages. Similarly once we educate people in the diverse communities we serve in the United States, they too can be educators to their friends about diet, exercise and prevention.Over time, David Werner has worked as a health educator in more than 50 countries around the globe. His highly regarded book Donde No Hay Doctor, ( Where There is No Doctor: A Village Healthcare Handbook ), recommended by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, has been a source of health information for people providing medical care to the underserved everywhere.The U.S. spends trillions of dollars more than most nations on health care, and yet our clinical results rank in the lower half of industrialized countries. By investing in public health and health education, we can lower morbidity and mortality for decades to come. If we fail to learn from these successes, we do so at our peril.", "external_links": ["http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/summit/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_There_is_No_Doctor"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:28:07.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
