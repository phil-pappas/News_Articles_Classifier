In the heart of fall color season, the weather has been spectacular. But the colors? Green still predominates in some places and where there are autumnal hues, they're muted.\nThose who ventured out this weekend enjoyed perfect leaf-peeping conditions, and in many locations south of Rochester in the Finger Lakes and Southern Tier there are plenty of leaves to be peeped. Some hillsides are dotted with hardwoods that have turned yellow, orange, gold and brown — but the colors lack brilliance. Sometimes it almost looks as if the trees are shrouded with gauze or hidden by a thin pall of smoke.\nThere are almost none of the bright-red sugar maples that many people love. And while one hillside may be festooned in dullish fall colors, the hill on the other side of the valley may remain all green.\nTwo weeks ago, an expert said he had noticed a lack of bright hues.\n\"I live in the hills outside of Ithaca … and I'm noticing the same 'drabness' that you are,\" said George Hudler, a professor of plant integrative science at Cornell University whose specialties include trees and tree pathology. \"I'm also skeptical about the TV weather forecasts that peak color is — without reservation — on the way.\"\nAll is not lost, Hudler and others said then. Things are just delayed and, well, a little drab.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nSave This List: 12 Ontario County Activities For Fall\nFoliage in Broome County, New York. (Photo: Steve Orr)\n\"We may still have a colorful fall. I don't think it's going to be as good as in normal years, and I think it's going to be shorter,\" Hudler said. \"If you consider our best autumn on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 10, I think we're going to be looking at between a 6½ and a 7½.\"\n(The subdued fall color is not limited to this part of New York. This reporter's sister, a Michigan denizen, recently took a week-long leaf-peeping bus tour through upstate New York and New England. The color was disappointing — green and dull — everywhere but sections of New Hampshire and western Massachusetts, my sister and her fellow travelers reported during an overnight stop in Rochester last week.)\nThe outbreak of vivid colors that enliven upstate New York hardwoods follows a schedule that varies from year to year, driven in good part by temperature and moisture. This year, as it turns out, the weather has caused Finger Lakes autumn colors to be later than normal.\nDaytime temperatures in September were considerably warmer than normal, and nights were cool but hardly cold. These conditions help trees build up nutrients. Leaves are essentially energy factories, producing chlorophyll that turns sunlight into the sugars that sustain trees. The leaves continue to make nutrients, and produce new chlorophyll to make still more nutrients, as long as the weather stays warm.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nTake time to peep at fall's glory\nBuy Photo Green still dominates in many parts of upstate New York this October. (Photo: Patti Singer/staff photographer)\nAnd the chlorophyll is what makes the leaves green.\nThey will remain green until temperatures take a dive, as they always do at some point in the autumn season. This, coupled with fall's shorter days and longer nights, causes leaves to cease production of sugar and chlorophyll.\n\"Once it's too cold for the leaf to keep making the food (sugar), then the chlorophyll goes away. The timing here is highly variable and changes on an almost week-to-week basis,\" Jerry Carlson, a research scientist in forest health for the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said two weeks ago.\nOnce temperatures decline enough, sugar and chlorophyll production end, causing leaves' green color to fade and be replaced by the autumnal yellows, oranges, browns and reds.\nNighttime temperatures did drop in early October, perhaps enough to begin that process. But temperatures took a warmer turn and have been relatively mild in the last week or so.\nCarlson noted that the late-September warmth would give sugar maples extra nutrients and thus an extra helping of anthocyanin, the pigment that lends red, crimson and purple hues to the leaves.\nFoliage near Keuka Lake. (Photo: Steve Orr)\nTo many, those brilliant red maple leaves are the true stars of fall.\n\"That's why it's such a big deal around here,\" Carlson noted. \"Really, the anticipation and uncertainty of what the sugar maples are going to look like is what fall foliage color anxiety is all about.\"\nCarlson was sanguine about the prospects for a latish but lovely display this fall in the Finger Lakes and Southern Tier. \"There should be ample reds, bronzes and golds there now and still to come, he said two weeks back.\nSo why the doubts?\nHudler notes three issues, the first attributed to the very dry conditions in late summer and early fall.\nTrees lose moisture as it evaporates from the surfaces of leaves. When there's too little moisture reaching its roots, a tree can and will conserve water by shedding leaves to reduce evaporative loss. The leaves turn dirty yellow or brown and quickly fall to the ground.\nHudler said this clearly is happening in the region. October, like long stretches of September, has been mostly sere.\nBut Hudler also said it doesn't explain all the dead leaves already skittering around the forest floors.\nFor that he goes back to early summer, when the region experienced a virtual deluge of rainfall. That triggered \"unusually severe incidences\" of fungal leaf diseases, he said.\n\"These diseases take some time to cause enough damage to be noticeable but they seem to be quite conspicuous now and in some cases with enough severity to cause premature (before full color) leaf drop,\" Hudler said. Maples, dogwoods and aspen are among the trees that seem to be most afflicted this fall.\nHeavy precipitation also damaged the roots of maples and other trees growing in poorly drained areas, he added. This too has led to premature leaf loss.\nCarlson, of DEC, doesn't give as much weight to these issues, and believes classic autumnal hues will make their way to Finger Lakes forests — provided there are no ill-timed storms to knock leaves from tree limbs before people can gawk at them.\n\"It's shaping up to be a spectacular fall color season, if the wind and rain stay away,\" he said two weeks ago.\nJudging by conditions this past weekend, it remains unclear if optimism was well-placed.\nSORR@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f2d4ceca58a6a0c73acc03cf81ff9b74a2332db/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802450986175723-Fall-color-2015.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802450986175723-Fall-color-2015.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802552158095275-IMG-2662.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00efad88a2122a3dded5d81fb58e57c19da325a9/c=0-26-509-314&r=x1128&c=2000x1125/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Rochester/Rochester/635799816608995325-ThinkstockPhotos-484438322.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802552143743183-IMG-2727.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f2d4ceca58a6a0c73acc03cf81ff9b74a2332db/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802552143743183-IMG-2727.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802552158095275-IMG-2662.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f2d4ceca58a6a0c73acc03cf81ff9b74a2332db/c=4-0-3260-2448&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802552158095275-IMG-2662.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802450986175723-Fall-color-2015.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/19415fb2e360983f461c09e689e9bfab0c503178/c=1254-0-4318-3064/local/-/media/2015/09/15/Rochester/Rochester/635779362522632695-foliage-photo.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/Rochester/Rochester/635802552143743183-IMG-2727.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:13:37.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
