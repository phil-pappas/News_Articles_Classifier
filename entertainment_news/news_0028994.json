Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 4:15 am Behind the scenes: What happens during maintenance outage at nuclear plant? By Jared Stonesifer jstonesifer@timesonline.com Timesonline.com | 0 comments \nSHIPPINGPORT -- A nuclear power plant is an active place on a normal day, but the 1,000-acre Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station truly comes to life during refueling outages that happen every 18 months. \nThe second of two units at the power plant shut down in late September for a refueling and maintenance outage, a 30- to 60-day process that includes an influx of more than 1,100 temporary workers on the campus on top of the 800 who already work there. \nIt’s not just people who crowd the campus now. Dozens of pieces of equipment and machinery are scattered across the complex waiting to be used during the long process. \nThe nerve center of the entire refueling and maintenance operation is the Outage Control Center, a room packed full of workers who monitor the most important aspect of the process via video feedback. \nMore than a dozen workers at any given time watch a large projector screen that broadcasts a live feed of the work going on in the reactor, and jot down notes and keep detailed records to ensure the safety of the process. \nThat process involves removing all 157 fuel rods from the reactor, inspecting and cleaning them for optimal performance. \nBut highly trained workers also replace 50 of those rods with new fuel that is packed full of uranium, a delicate process that is central to operations at the nuclear power plant. \nOfficials there said a golf ball-sized mass of uranium provides as much power as 25 train cars packed full of coal. Meanwhile, each 12-foot-tall fuel rod in the reactor is packed with hundreds of golf ball-sized masses. \nWorkers retrieve each fuel rod using a crane during a process that isn’t unlike a claw machine seen in arcades and amusement parks. \nEric Larson, vice president of the plant, said it takes more than 40 hours to remove all of the 157 fuel rods in the reactor, or a pace of about four per hour. \nThe process is entirely different from a claw machine, Larson said, in the sense that the fuel rods are located under 25 feet of water. \nIt’s work that can be done only by highly skilled workers who undergo thousands of hours of training before the outage begins. \nOn top of that, Larson said more than 200,000 man-hours are worked during the actual outage, as nearly 2,000 workers on campus take turns working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nReplacing the spent fuel rods in the reactor might be the main attraction of the outage, but it’s by no means the only thing happening at the plant. \nA bevy of workers performs preventive maintenance on key infrastructure elements, such as diesel generators that exist for backup power if needed, transformers that power the plant, and turbines, which spin magnets to produce electricity at the plant. \nThe scene is so busy over at Beaver Valley that officials have to call in help for traffic control in the mornings and evenings as so many workers come to the campus. \nLarson said the current outage is going very well but couldn’t offer a timetable on when it might be finished. \nRegardless, it won’t be long until the process starts all over again. Larson said it takes two years of planning for every refueling outage. \nBeing that each unit has to undergo refueling and maintenance every 18 months, the planning starts for the next outage before the current one is even over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:01:23.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
