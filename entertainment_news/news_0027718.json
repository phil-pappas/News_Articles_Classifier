That way you can catch up with a backlog of work. Lucky number: 103. \nSCORPIO (Oct. 23 to Nov. 21): A friend’s or partner’s moodiness is making your life miserable. If attempts to bring cheer do not succeed fairly quickly, find something more pleasant to do. Be realistic about a relationship that no longer makes you happy. Lucky number: 454. \nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 to Dec. 21): A friend or paramour is set to start a new creative pastime but will not want your involvement. You feel like an onlooker, as this is one of those hobbies the person will share with fellow enthusiasts. Do not worry, as the novelty will soon wear off. Lucky number: 257. \nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22 to Jan. 19): Getting the hang of some innovative work changes will take time, but they will ultimately make life easier for you. Your willingness to accept novelty will make a favorable impression on the boss. Lucky number: 584. \nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18): At times you are flush with cash, at others you have little to spare. It seems a law of life that money arrives through one door and goes out through another almost immediately. Lucky number: 085. \nPISCES (Feb. 19 to March 20): It pays to monitor events from behind the scenes. Keep your plans to yourself, or you will part with all gained progress. A rival will be quick to snatch a good opportunity away from you. To avoid this, emulate the violet and shrink out of the mainstream. Lucky number: 639. \nARIES (March 21 to April 20): Your troubles will soon pass if you cease to ponder and dwell on them. If you make an embarrassing comment, apologize, and move on. If the person who took offense cannot forgive you, it’s his or her problem, as you are not contributing to other people’s misery. Lucky number: 740. \nTAURUS (April 21 to May 20): Refuse to let other people distract you from your intentions. Friends and colleagues have little to offer of a positive or constructive nature despite desires to help. Lucky number: 483. \nGEMINI (May 21 to June 20): Recent efforts with new projects are starting to pay off. If you have been looking on the dark side, the clouds will roll back now. The chances are you will be offered a change of direction that will exploit a special skill or talent. Lucky number: 308. \nCANCER (June 21 to July 22): Although your hands are full, most matters will proceed smoothly. Travel or visitors will make a welcome change from burdensome and boring chores. Tap into the uplifting energy around you to shake off some negative and stunting emotions. Lucky number: 571. \nLEO (July 23 to Aug. 22): If developments early on this week do not send you into hiding, later occurrences might. Refuse to show when someone’s insensitive words or behavior upsets you. Discovering more about certain people and situations will increase your future options. Lucky number: 365. \nVIRGO (Aug. 23 to Sept. 22): A recent large expenditure will have you and a partner needing to check accounts to see how matters stand. Money will be fractionally better than you expected, although you are a long way from being a millionaire. Lucky number: 697. ■ \nTo inquire about a personal reading, call Mystic Terry at 215-467-5162.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:55:50.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
