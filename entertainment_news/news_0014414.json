Wisconsin Ave.: \nCritic's Choice: This special food sampling opportunity brings together 17 restaurants from dining critic Carol Deptolla's Top 30 lists, including 12 from this year. Note: It's only on Saturday, and it costs extra. \nFigure skating: On Sunday, watch local skaters perform on a Skate America rink, and check out a cooking demonstration by Olympic medalist Brian Boitano, who also will sign copies of his cookbook. \nNew brew: Samples of a special brew by Milwaukee Brewing Co. — cleverly named EditoriAle — will be passed out at the Journal Sentinel booth at the front of the exhibition hall, where you also can meet some of your favorite writers. \nGet crafty: On the back side of that booth, make a wine cork key chain for yourself or as a stocking stuffer. \nGet cooking: Milwaukee Area Technical College again will offer hands-on classes. Make a pumpkin tart, Asian spring roll or Spanish tapas — or decorate cupcakes. \nBut also check out the many other cooking demonstrations on three stages. \nLove sushi? Demonstrations by the folks from Rice N Roll Bistro will be held at 11:30 a.m. and 12:30, 1:30, 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. both days at \"Sushi Square.\" \nEat up! Among new restaurants offering samples on the main exhibit floor are the Big Eazy, with Cajun food; two additional Marcus restaurants: Safe House and Miller Time Pub & Grill; and the Nepalese restaurant The Cheel. Eat cheese to your Dairyland heart's content at two cheese islands. \nSwirl and sip: Try your choice of 26 wine brands in the Pick 'n Save Wine Gallery, along with other wines throughout the floor. \nCheers! Or order a craft cocktail from the Bittercube Bar. \nHelp the hungry: Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin will hold a fundraising raffle both days for items donated by exhibitors and sponsors. Their volunteers will be staffing the glass washing station, with tips also going to fight hunger. \nBook a one-of-a-kind cruise: Justin Aprahamian, chef-owner of Sanford Restaurant, and former Sanford chef-owner Sandy D'Amato will be on stage at Wine & Dine. Next August, the James Beard Award winners will team up for a first-ever Wine & Dine Wisconsin European river cruise.
