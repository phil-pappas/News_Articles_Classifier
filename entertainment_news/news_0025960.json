For a handful of rescue dogs, the circus provided a home and a job to boot. The pups are part of an act at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey’s LEGENDS, the 144th edition of the Greatest Show on Earth, which landed in Boston on Wednesday.\nHans and Maria Klose are the husband and wife dog team who travel with their troop of performing pups in the circus. They train the dogs to jump through hoops, do tricks while walking on their hind legs and jump rope.\nIn their pack of 20, half are rescue dogs turned circus stars. Hans says it’s getting harder and harder to adopt from pounds or rescue organizations.\n“A lot of the dogs I have aren’t from the pound but they are from people that didn’t want their dog any more,” said Klose. “Pound dogs are difficult to get … especially when you tell them that the dogs are performing or with the circus … there are mixed emotions about that.”\nRob Halpin, the PR director from animal advocacy group and animal hospital MSPCA Angell is part of one such organization that’s wary of adopting animals out to the circus.\n“We probably wouldn’t have the circus adopt from us,” Halpin said, though he admitted it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.\n“From our perspective, what’s most important to us with a dog (or any animal) is that they are in a home where they are kept safe, happy and healthy,” said Halpin.\nWe had a visit with a handful of RBBB circus dogs and their trainers yesterday. The clean, playful and friendly canines jumped and licked the handful of people on site — from their trainers to anyone in the room.\nThe use of animals in the circus has ruffled the feathers of many activists over the years and there are often protests in the cities the circus performs in. Feld Entertainment, which owns RBBB, has responded and is re­tiring its elephants — all of them will be gone from the show by 2018.\nTo put patrons at ease, the circus often hosts an Animal Open House pre-show at which the public can see where the animals live, talk to caretakers and ask questions.\n“Do your own research and make an educated decision for yourself because circus animals have a better life than most people do,” said Klose.\nAs for the dogs, digs are a heated motor home specially designed for them, with a 20-by-20-foot exercise pen, pool and an outdoor awning for summertime shade. According to Klose, the dogs have 24-hour-a-day vet care, get plenty of exercise and the best food.\nWe asked to see the pups’ home and while Klose was happy to oblige, circus officials said no.\nThe circus is in town until Sunday; you can get tickets at ticketmaster.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:39:03.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
