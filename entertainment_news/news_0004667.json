She turns the microphone to one of the men, who proclaims his love for his partner before saying, \"Will you marry me, please?\" \nMadonna says, \"You may kiss the bride,\" and the two kiss to loud applause. \nMadonna then tosses the couple a bouquet of flowers and puts on a crucifix necklace. \n\"You get a bouquet, I get a crucifix, it all works out,\" she says. \nThe video was uploaded to YouTube Monday by CTV personality Stacey Brotzel. \nThe Sunday concert at Rexall Place was Madonna's first in Edmonton, 32 years after the release of her self-titled debut album. \nThe second of two sold-out Edmonton shows on her Rebel Heart tour happens Monday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:28:42.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
