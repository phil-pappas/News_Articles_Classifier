These are two big brand names when it comes to personal improvement.\nIt remains to be seen, however, if the struggling diet company can get back on track even with Winfrey's multimedia empire, still-devoted following and shrewd instincts to support it.\nSome in the media have been quick to cite the Oprah Effect, shorthand popularized in the heyday of Winfrey's bygone Chicago-based daytime talk show for her \"golden touch\" in popularizing everything from books to pajamas to a certain U.S. senator from Illinois.\nWithout minimizing all that she did send soaring — she sold books, though it's not clear how many were read — let's not forget there's always been some litter amid the glitter.\nOprah Winfrey goes on diet, gains Weight Watchers deal Tribune wire reports Oprah Winfrey, who has publicly struggled with her weight for decades, is going on a diet again.

But this time she stands to gain a lot of money from her efforts.\nWeight Watchers said Monday that it signed a five-year deal with the former talk show host. Winfrey, a co-owner of OWN: The Oprah Winfrey...\n(Tribune wire reports) Remember the Pontiac G6?\nAs in \"You get a car! You get a car! And you get a car!\"\nEleven years after Winfrey helped General Motors introduce the successor to its Grand Am to the nation on her program with that frenetic, unforgettable, multimillion-dollar giveaway for each member of her studio audience, there is no G6.\nThere's also no Pontiac.\nThere was an initial boost from all the attention Winfrey brought, but the G6 received so-so reviews and wound up with sales to match.\nPontiac limped along before bankruptcy-bound GM pulled the plug, with its last vehicle rolling off the line in late 2009.\nNow Winfrey had nothing to do with what dragged down Pontiac. If anything, she briefly offered the company a ray of hope. But it might be wise to put a muffler on the Midas talk.\nThe price of Weight Watchers shares, through Friday's close, has more than doubled what it was before Winfrey's involvement became known. But that's still almost half its 52-week high of $29.94 almost a year ago.\nOprah Winfrey finds 'real freedom' since the end of her talk show Debra Birnbaum Oprah Winfrey wants to make one thing clear: She is not retired.\nEver since her eponymous talk show ended in 2011, she's found what she calls \"real freedom.\"\n\"I love the way my life has opened up,\" she tells Variety, in her sun-drenched, spacious office at OWN, her self-named cable network, in...\nOprah Winfrey wants to make one thing clear: She is not retired.\nEver since her eponymous talk show ended in 2011, she's found what she calls \"real freedom.\"\n\"I love the way my life has opened up,\" she tells Variety, in her sun-drenched, spacious office at OWN, her self-named cable network, in...\n(Debra Birnbaum) The company is lugging around a little more than $2 billion in debt, while its business has been eroded by mobile calorie counting apps and activity monitors especially popular with younger dieters.\nThrough the first half of this year, profits were down by almost half with sales down by more than one-fifth. Weight Watchers meeting attendance slipped 38 percent from 2013 to 2014.\nMorningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, in his report, Quote: d CEO Jim Chambers as conceding Weight Watchers has \"missed out on the mobility revolution\" and that its offerings \"have become less appealing in this changing market.\"\nHottovy warned that shares have edged into \"overbought territory\" in the excitement over Winfrey's investment.\nBut at the same time, this is a nation with plenty of people who should at least be trying to lose weight. (I know.) There should be opportunities for Weight Watchers if it can get its act together.\nSurely it can't hurt to have Winfrey talking about how Weight Watchers \"has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for.\"\nYet even when Winfrey goes all-in on something, it doesn't necessarily sell. She produced, starred in and promoted with all her might director Jonathan Demme's 1998 film adaptation of author Toni Morrison's \"Beloved.\"\nThe $80 million movie wouldn't have been made without Winfrey. Most reviews were positive. Still, it was a box office bust, bringing a little more than $22 million.\nShe has said her worst career moment was when, on its opening weekend, \"Beloved\" got trounced by the slasher film \"Bride of Chucky.\"\n\"It sent me into a massive, depressive macaroni-and-cheese eating tailspin,\" Winfrey told Piers Morgan on CNN years later.\nAsked how much mac and cheese, she said \"about 30 pounds\" and she laughed.\nIt looked good at the time.\nMargin call: Danish-born Peter Jensen of Western Springs died 54 years ago Sunday at age 75. Working in Napa, Calif., in 1915, he and Edwin Pridham developed something they dubbed the Magnavox, Latin for \"great voice.\" We know it as a public-address loudspeaker. Jensen speakers? His too.
