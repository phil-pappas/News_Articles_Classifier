He has pleaded not guilty to the charges which accuse him of sexually assaulting and abusing a female relative between 2005 and earlier this year.\nWright spent 23 years with the police department in Elburn before the village fired him in connection to his arrest. His request for a lower bond was denied during an Oct. 16 court appearance. Wright previously said his family had approximately $500,000 in medical debt and he had no money to post bond.\nLast week was also when prosecutors filed the notice stating the \"conduct alleged in counts one through 33 constitute separate and distinct acts,\" a move that increases the overall minimum sentence involved should Wright be convicted of multiple charges.\nThe \"minimum sentencing range would (be) 143 years and a maximum of 648 years (in prison) if convicted of each count ...,\" the filing states.\nWright is scheduled to return to court Nov. 10.\nDan Campana is a freelance writer for The Beacon-News\nCopyright Â© 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Crime", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56292013/turbine/ct-abn-former-elburn-cop-st-1023-20151022-thumbnail"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:29:22.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
