If anything I suppose it would be unfair if one person from Ireland was in a show and everybody else was from the UK and all of the votes, or most of the votes (from Ireland) were going for me,\" he said.\nEarlier, Rihanoff had blasted a report that claimed she'd branded O'Donnell \"an old man\" and said he was unlikely to win.\nShe wrote on Twitter: \"Everyone knows how much we enjoy working together! Rude journalism.\"\nPromoted stories Talking about the incident, O'Donnell said: \"What can you do, things are going to be written - it certainly didn't affect Kristina and myself at all, we just enjoyed learning the dance, doing the dances, and I suppose I would have loved to be able to do better. Somebody has to go every week and this week it was my turn.\"\nHe also added light-heartedly: \"I don't think I'm old!\"\nIn Saturday night's show, professional dancer Gleb Savchenko whipped his top off, but O'Donnell joked he was \"delighted\" he'd not be getting his off soon.\n\"I think I'm doing the world a favour, or maybe the lack of votes is doing the world a favour,\" he said.\nAfter dancing off against Gallacher and Cole, who performed their Paso Doble to U2's Beautiful Day, judge Craig Revel Horwood said: \"One couple did really, really well in the dance-off and one couple I am afraid made a lot of mistakes.\n\"I am going for the couple that was the most powerful, and that was Kirsty and Brendan.\"\nJudges Darcey Bussell and Bruno Tonioli agreed, saying: \"I would like to keep the couple that committed less mistakes tonight, and that is Kirsty and Brendan.\"\nShare article The latest ratings figures show that Strictly continues to dominate Saturday night TV, with the show peaking at 10.6 million viewers, with an average of 9.7 million tuning in.\nThe remaining 12 couples will take to the dancefloor once more next week when Strictly Come Dancing returns on Saturday 24 October at 6.35pm, with the results show on Sunday 25 October at 7.15pm on BBC One.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-19T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:51:50.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
