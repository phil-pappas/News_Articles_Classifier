Photograph by: Shawn Conner \nLove Bomb isn’t a musical, exactly, but it is a play with music. \nIn this, it’s somewhat similar to recent Vancouver productions like Are We Cool Now? (which incorporates songs by local singer/songwriter Dan Mangan) and Chelsea Hotel (which uses Leonard Cohen tunes) and the upcoming Arts Club production The Waiting Room (which is partly based on an album by Spirit of the West singer John Mann). \nWhat Love Bomb does that is somewhat unique is unfold a mystery using the lyrics in a set of songs. \nThe setting is a bar, and for the first few moments of this, the opening show of Firehall’s new season, we’re presented with Justine, a young musician with a modified mohawk/rockabilly quiff (top marks for original hair). \nFollowing a brief sound check, Justine treats us to the first bars of a song before she is interrupted by a pounding on the club’s door. Lillian has come to the bar to look for something she thinks she’s left behind. When she realizes who has opened the door, Lillian claims to be a fan — apparently, one of Justine’s songs has gone viral, at least in the Interior. \nIt soon becomes apparent that Lillian has a deeper connection to the music — specifically, the lyrics — than she at first lets on. \nIn this shameless hussy production, directed by Renée Iaci, getting the music right is crucial to bringing the audience into this world. In this regard, Meghan Gardiner (book and lyrics) and her collaborator Steve Charles (music and additional lyrics) have done an exceptional job. We are told that Justine is “becoming a big thing,” a fact that brings the two characters together, and so the music — or at least one song — has to rise above the average, which it mostly does. \nIt’s also necessary for a bad tune to be in Justine’s set list, and the song Deana comes across as credibly worse than the others while sounding like something one might hear at an open-mic night in any town. \nSpeaking of which, Love Bomb takes place in Prince George, and a running theme is small town versus big city. References to Fort St. John (Lillian’s home) and Calgary (Justine’s hometown) abound, while Vancouver is invoked to denote a den of iniquity from which no young woman will emerge unscathed. \nAt one point, Justine mentions Yaletown, and in its Love Bomb context the neighbourhood is made to sound like ground zero for sex slavery in the Western hemisphere. \nYaletown is a lot of things, but it’s (probably) not that, and here is where Love Bomb runs into trouble. \nWhile the manner in which the mystery unfolds is unique, the actual story that emerges is not that compelling. There is a third person in the play, one who is mentioned frequently but never appears (except, perhaps, in the lyrics). Too many elements — an alcoholic parent, the wrong crowd, dreams of escape and making it in the music industry — are touched on superficially. Our missing person remains abstract, and the situation too flat, for us to get wrapped up in the drama. \nThat said, Sara Vickruck and Deb Pickman do solid work presenting Justine and Lillian’s increasingly intense relationship. Vickruck has a strong voice that carries the songs with conviction, and Pickman effectively conveys her character’s emotional anguish and strength. \nAnother nice touch is Drew Facey’s set, which features a backdrop of what looks like a metal sculpture in the shape of two mashed-together provinces in front of a brick wall, and manages to convey both the play’s internal tension and the stage of a small-city bar. \nThe title, Love Bomb, is never explained, although in the program Gardiner writes that the phrase means “to influence someone by lavishing them with gifts and attention.” This may be the idea at the heart of the play, but Love Bomb doesn’t delve deep enough into questions of why some people go down one path, and not another. \nBut it does have strong performances, decent music and that super-cool haircut. And you don’t have to venture into the lawless streets of Yaletown to see it. © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:01:52.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
