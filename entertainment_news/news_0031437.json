AP Photo - Ben Margot Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nUS President Barack Obama is taking some delight in the Republicans' struggle to find a new House leader to replace John Boehner. \nObama opened a fundraiser on Saturday with 1,000-plus donors by telling the audience that rapper Kanye West was thinking about running for House Speaker. \nThe 54-year-old politician then went on to offer advice to West, joking about the Bound 2 hitmaker's recent proclamations that he had planned to run for president in 2020 and suggested the rapper's marriage to Keeping Up With the Kardashians star Kim Kardashian West would help him in his potential future career. \nSpeaking in San Francisco's Warfield Theater ahead of Kanye's performance, he quipped: \"In a little while you are going to hear from a guy who is thinking about getting into politics. \n\"In case Kanye's serious about this whole POTUS thing, or as he calls it, Peezy, I do have advice for him; \n\"You've got to deal with strange characters who behave as if they are on a reality TV show. So you've got to be cool with that.\" \nAnd in reference to Kanye's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, he added: \"This is the second tip, saying that you have a beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy. That's what's known as 'off message' in politics, you can't something like that.\" \nAnd Obama even poked fun at himself while questioning Kanye's chances of being voted into office. \nHe said: \"Do you really think this country is going to elect a black guy from the south side of Chicago with a funny name to be President of the US? That is crazy! That's cray.\" \nObama was in San Francisco and Los Angeles on Saturday for four fundraisers. \nObama encouraged the audience to be politically active and says he plans to remain so when his presidency concludes, saying \"I'm just getting started\". barack obama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:35:39.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
