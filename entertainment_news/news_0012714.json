David Cassidy charged in Florida mishap \nBrendon was charged with robbery, two counts of criminal mischief and obstruction of breathing or blood circulation. \nIt was his fourth arrest within the past a year and the only incident of the four that involved alleged violence toward another person. \nAccording to the police report, Brendon's current or former girlfriend arrived at his hotel, and when he asked her to stay, she refused. \nThe girlfriend alleges that he took her car keys, threw her cell phone, breaking it, and returned to his room, where she says he choked her while she was pinned against a wall. \nPolice found Brendon a few blocks away, and he was taken into custody. He posted a $20,000 bond. \nPolice say there was alcohol involved. Brendon entered rehab in July, a few months after a third arrest on a charge of criminal mischief and property damage. \nThe actor made headlines last month for storming off the set of \"Dr. Phil\" after the TV host accused him of smelling like alcohol and had \"hard words\" for his mother (Brendon later admitted he had been drinking the night before). \nBrendon did not respond to CNN's request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:26:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
