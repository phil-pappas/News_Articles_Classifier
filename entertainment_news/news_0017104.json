Dat Dog will be off leash and wandering the streets when the hot dog chain launches its Datmobile, a bright blue food truck.\nIn two weeks, after a little suspension work, the Datmobile will be out serving all of Dat Dog's top sellers. The truck is rigged with lights and a sound system with a mic for the driver.\n\"I was driving around the streets and acting like Mr. Okra,\" said chief operating officer Bill DiPaola.\nThe Datmobile will be equipped with GPS, to help hungry fans track it down.\nThe truck can also be rented for parties. Dat Dog already has a cart for events, but the Datmobile can serve more of the menu, including french fries, and captures the goofy spirit of the brightly colored restaurants.\n\"I couldn't stand the idea of going to someone's house and not giving them the full Dat Dog experience,\" DiPaola said.\nDat Dog also recently added a hamburger to its menu, except the ground-on-site beef is rolled into the shape of a sausage and served in a hot dog bun.\n\"It's a hamburger, it's just in the shape of a hot dog,\" DiPaola said.\nDiPaola said the \"Dat Burger\" would be available on the truck.\nNow you can also order all Dat Dogs on a leaf of romaine instead of a bun. But why would you want to do that? Those buns are tasty.\nDat Dog: 5030 Freret St., New Orleans, 504.899.6883; 3336 Magazine St., New Orleans, 504.324.2226; 601 Frenchmen St., New Orleans, 504.309.3362; Lakeside Shopping Center, 3301 Veterans Memorial Boulevard, Metairie\n***\nGot a tip?
