Now an official resident of the Hotel Cortez, Detective Lowe is slowly starting to discover how bizarre his new home is. He starts having disturbing visions, including a rotting zombie couple having sex in his shower, and quick flashes of both his missing son and the horrifying Addiction Demon/Human Mole Rat Guy from last week. \nJohn ends up meeting Hypodermic Sally in the bar in the middle of the night – definitively answering the question of whether people who are not Iris can see her – and they have a heart to heart about how their lives suck. It turns out that John’s an alcoholic – ding, ding, addiction alert – and Sally manages to get him to share some details about the last time he got drunk, which also ties into the day his son disappeared. He explains that he can’t drink like that anymore because he can’t afford to get lost again, before leaving Sally alone. \n(There’s definitely a bizarre connection between Sally and the horrifying Addiction Demon but how? Since John does not get raped to death by the Mole Rat Man, maybe you have to actively be engaging in your addiction for him to appear? IDK.) \nSome new people arrive. Will Drake stages a fashion show at the Cortez, ostensibly to introduce two new characters: Vogue editor Claudia Bankson (Naomi Campbell) and model Tristan Duffy (Finn Wittrock). Claudia doesn’t have much to do this week, but Tristan sure does – he is a dramatic hot mess who loves cocaine, leather pants and fighting with strangers. The Countess is immediately attracted to him – you can tell because the entire episode goes into slow motion when they lock eyes. Donovan, not actually being blind, immediately picks up on this and wants to know what was up with their aggressive staring. \nThe Countess says something ridiculous about Tristan being “full of rage” that apparently smells like copper (ew?). Meanwhile, Tristan decides to dramatically end his modeling career by scarring his face with scissors, because he is totally crazy. He storms around the hotel in search of more coke, before getting discovered by Donovan, almost eaten, and ultimately rescued by the Countess. \nHere’s a blast from (to?) the past. After saving his life, the Countess decides to let him go, but somehow Tristan ends up in a magical time travelling elevator on his way out. No, really. The elevator takes a detour to the seventh floor, which seems to be located in the 1930s, where he meets a strange man played by “AHS” regular Evan Peters. This dude is a complete nightmare who tries to convince Tristan to murder a prostitute for fun, and then shoots her in the face himself when he says no. What a winner! The music, costumes and setting all seem to indicate that this is a particularly aggressive ghost hallucination, because it seems very like an actual scene from the past, particularly when the Countess shows up to bodily pull Tristan out. \nAdult story hour is pretty scary, actually. Since they’re the only two living kids in the hotel, Lochlan Drake and Scarlett Lowe become friends. They explore the building together, and he shows her all of the cool stuff he’s found there already, like the glass coffins in the basement where the creepy blonde vampire children sleep. Whee! \nScarlett clearly recognizes that one of the Children of the Corn is her missing brother. Unfortunately, Holden refuses to leave the hotel and sort of tries to bite her, but Scarlett is undeterred. She takes a selfie with him, and goes home to tell her parents he’s alive. Neither of them believes her, obviously, because she sounds crazy, and the photo she took only features a weird, scary blur next to her. \nSo John stomps back to the Cortez to confront Iris about letting Scarlett wander all over the hotel. Iris takes this opportunity to spill some secrets, telling him the story of James March, original owner of the Cortez, who also happens to be the creepy, murder-happy dude Tristan met earlier. He built the hotel as an outlet for all the strange stuff he was into, like murder. He put in a torture chamber, added hallways with no exits, and included lots of chutes for the convenient disposal of bodies. \nEven though he killed his contractors as soon as they figured out what he was doing, someone eventually ratted him out for all the murdering, and he and his uber-devoted laundress Miss Evers killed themselves. John doesn’t really see how this story is important, but Iris says he’s going to have to expand his thinking to figure out what’s really going on in the hotel. She says Room 64 used to be Mr. March’s office, which makes it the black heart of the whole enterprise. \nJohn uses Iris’ story to figure out the pattern of that serial killer he’s been chasing, though. He’s basing his crimes on the Ten Commandments, and is continuing what March started way back when he was killing migrant workers to disprove the existence of God. Gross! \nThe Countess makes a new boyfriend. Tristan is feeling pretty great about himself now that the Countess has turned him. They celebrate by having a bunch of sex, while the Countess helpfully explains how the rules of vampirism work in the “AHS” universe. \nThose “with the virus” don’t have fangs, so they cut people open to drink their blood. The sun should be avoided – it makes them weak. Blackout curtains work as well as coffins. They can pretty much do whatever, as long as they’re smart about it, because though they’re immortal they can still die. Oh, and he’s not supposed to love other people, because the Countess is a total narcissist. \nAs you might expect, Donovan is very unhappy his freaky girlfriend has turned another man. The Countess says she never wanted to hurt him, but the afterlife happens and he should pack his stuff. His protestations of love don’t sway her, nor does his totally heartbroken expression when she rubs it in his face about how good it felt to turn Tristan. Man, their breakup escalated quickly. \nAlso, seriously, Gaga. Come on. I like Wittrock and all, but this is MATT BOMER you’re kicking out. Have you even been watching this show or seen his many impressive shirtless sequences? \nAll I’m saying is Jessica Lange would not make this rookie mistake. \nOdds and Ends: \n• This episode felt about 15 minutes too long. \n• Line of the night? “Skinny jeans are out. Fringe is in. Ponchos are forever. Make a note of it.\"— Liz Taylor, dropping fashion knowledge. \n• I’m weirdly obsessed with Liz Taylor and Denis O’Hare deserves more to do than tend bar. \n• Still no Angela Bassett. Why do you hate me, show? \n• James March and Miss Evers are still haunting the hotel and interacting with people in the present-day, but the scene where Tristan meets him actually “felt” like the past. Messy storytelling or is that on purpose? \n• It’s kind of fun to see Peters play such an openly monstrous character for once.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:08:06.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
