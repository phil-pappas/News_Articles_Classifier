The episode starts out with the regular cast, a group of kids who call themselves members of The Midnight Society, meeting at their regular spot in the woods. They settle in a circle around a campfire in the middle of the night and wait for a member to tell them a new spooky story. Before she begins, the kids discuss how everything is scarier at night. Is everything scarier at night? The creators of horror shows seem to think so.\n\"American Horror Story: Hotel\" starts at 10:00 pm on Wednesday nights. If it aired at 10:00 am, would it be any less scary? The Midnight Society theory is that there is a big difference between those two points in time. Once the sun has gone down and the moon is bright in the sky, it’s not so easy to see anymore. Anything could sneak up on you, and it may be the bogey man. The \"American Horror Story: Hotel\" vampires are certainly a dangerous bunch when they get their hands on people in the dark of the night. There is no doubt about it that a vampire is always scariest when shrouded in darkness.\n\" Scream Queens \" is another show that comes on at night. It airs Tuesday nights at 9:00 pm. Somehow, it doesn’t seem very scary. One member of The Midnight Society pointed out that if something is scary then it should always be scary, regardless of what time it is. \"Scream Queens\" is one of those shows where it’s just not scary, and the setting of the sun has no effect on how frightening it is.\nBefore watching The Tale of the Nightly Neighbors , the author of this column did turn off the lights and close the curtains. It was the middle of the day, and she instinctually knew that horror is best seen in darkness. She didn’t need the kids in the show to tell her that darkness is scarier than daylight.\nThe Tale of the Nightly Neighbors did offer some good afternoon chills for the author. The storyteller ends her story with this chilling line, “With ghosts and ghouls there are no rules, but a vampire’s bite only comes at night. The end.” That may be a prophetic piece of wisdom for Hotel . The spilled blood from the hotel’s vampires may result in the end of Hotel Cortez.", "external_links": ["https://pixabay.com/en/flames-fire-campfire-burn-blaze-711279/)"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:44:55.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
