By Jan Skutch A Georgia of Investigation agent testified on Saturday that then- deputy Cpl. Jason Kenny told her that he Tased Mathew Ajibade four times while trying to bring him under control Jan. 1 at the Chatham County jail.\nAccording to an audio of the taped statement played in court. Kenny told agent Ashley Brown that Kenny said he “drive stunned” Ajibade three times to the midsection and once to his right leg to bring him under control in aa pre-booking cell.\n“I really couldn’t see his face,” Kenny said, adding that a spit mask and hair obscured his view.\nKenny said that Ajibade grunted and groaned, adding that “he did say he wanted to go, he wanted to die and he did scream as I was drive stunning him. I also was looking out for my officers and made sure they were doing the right things.”\nLater in his statement, Kenny said he acted as he did due to “aggressive nature towards the staff (and) I was just trying to make sure of the officers safety… He screamed when I Tased him.”\nKenny told Brown he left his assigned duties in another unit at the jail and dashed to where Ajibade was being restrained by other deputies.\n“I took control and told other officers to step off,” Kenny said. “I jumped in the wave because there were too many hands on, too many personnel around.”\nThe testimony during Saturday’s court session highlighted a series of interviews of Kenny by GBI and Sheriff’s internal investigators in the days following the death of Ajibade late Jan. 1 or early Jan. 2.\nChatham County Superior Court Judge James F. Bass Jr. is to resume trial at 9 a.m. on Monday.\nAjibade died in the restraining chair, a spit mask covering his face, sometime before 1:38 a.m. on Jan. 2 after jail staff failed to monitor him for an hour and a half.\nEvidence has shown that Ajibade was in handcuffs and leg shackles to restrain him after the earlier scuffle at the jail and was being placed in retraining chair in Cell 4 of the old booking section of the jail when Kenney called for a Taser and spit mask.\nEvidence showed that Kenny was not originally assigned to the pre-booking area on Jan. 1 but moved there after Sgt. Anza Rowland was disabled in the scuffle with Ajibade.\nHe told investigators he was the “only supervisor in that area” at the time he Tazed Ajibade and told anyone who was not a member of the Corrections Emergency Response Team to leave the cell.\nKenny, 31, and former deputy Maxine Evans, 56, along with Gregory Brown, a 45-year-old Corizon Health licensed practical nurse at the jail, are on trial for involuntary manslaughter for causing Ajibade’s death “without any intention to do so.”\nKenny is charged with using a Taser against a restrained Ajibade. The other two are charged with reckless conduct by failing to monitor Ajibade’s status.\nIn addition, Kenny and Evans are charged in two separate indictments with committing perjury before the Chatham County grand jury that was hearing the case in what the state contends was part of an attempt to cover up their involvement in the death.\nAll three defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nDuring subsequent interviews in evidence Saturday, Kenny said Ajibade continued to kick and scream and lock his body up when deputies attempted to put him in the seat,\n“When I Tased him on the leg, he sat down,” Kenny told investigators. “They still can be combative in restraints. I’ve seen it happen.”\nHe said he acted “because of my safety and the staff’s safety,” adding he felt authorized to restrained a detainee “to gain compliance and control of the situation.”\nBut, sheriff’s internal investigator Nicole Meyers told jurors that her use-of-force investigation and review of the Tasing event left her unconvinced.\n“From what I could see on the video, it was not appropriate,” Myers told Assistant District Attorney Christy Barker.\n“Was the use of a Taser in this case appropriate?” Barker asked.\n“It was not,” Meyers responded.\nKenny told investigator that use of a Taser is controllable use or force and preferable to a large number of deputies who he could not control.\nIn another interview with GBI agent Cyrus Purdiman, the agent said Kenny said it was his belief that he could use a Taser on someone who was fully restrained.\n“ If he had to do the same thing over again, he would do it because he thought it was appropriate,” Purdiman said Kenny told him.\nAlso Saturday, Baker asked Meyers if Kenny told her he had advised Lt. Debra Johnson that Ajibade had been non-compliant and “was Tased by me four times.”\n“Is that anything that Jason Kenny ever said to you?” Barker asked.\n“It’s not,” Meyers replied.\nKenny is charged with perjury by telling Johnson that on June 24.\n“You didn’t ask Kenny about Lt. Johnson?” Kenny’s lawyer, Willie Yancey II, asked Meyers.\n“I did not,” she responded.\nThe defense contends Johnson said she didn’t hear Kenny make that comment.\n“I can’t tell you whether or not she heard anything,” Meyers responded.\nBefore the jury arrived Saturday, the issue arose of whether retired Lt. Robert Brooks had made statements regarding use of a Taser on someone full restraints that were inconsistent with his testimony on Friday.\nThe comments attributed to Brooks came in connection to a separate use of force against another jail inmate.\nBass ordered the sheriff’s department to produce all documents, videos or other items involved in similar incidents by noon Monday.\n“It might go to (Brooks’) truthfulness,” he told Barker.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-10T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:19:53.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
