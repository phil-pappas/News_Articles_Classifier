Guy Hollands, one of the directors of Citizens Young Co.’s Southside Stories, says, “We are delighted to have been invited to take part in the Chrysalis Festival. Southside Stories is the result of a rewarding learning experience for the Young Co., producing their first verbatim production and writing and performing their own original music. To perform this piece using the words of people from all walks of life in Govanhill at the Chrysalis festival is a fantastic way for us to share some of the experiences of this diverse community with a wider audience beyond Glasgow.” The two days of performances by the four theatre groups, part of the national Call to Create, is complemented by a programme of talks and events with invited speakers, looking at the position of youth theatre in an international context and the profile of performance by young people in the media.

Four selected shows will each be performed twice over the two days of the festival: Friday 6 and Saturday 7 November 2015 in Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre. An innovation from Youth Theatre Arts Scotland, Chrysalis aims to attract new audiences to youth theatre arts, inspire Scotland’s youth arts sector and enhance public perception of creative work by young people. CALL TO CREATE Call to Create is a global collective of cultural organisations which are coming together for the first time to shout louder about the great art young people make. Young people often tell us they hit a glass ceiling in the creative world due to their age. But we know that if we combine the new ideas, energy and talent of young people with the experience of established artists, we can create some incredible artistic moments which can inspire audiences and other artists. The Call to Create network was established by the Roundhouse, Camden, London. http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/calltocreate THEATRE COMPANIES: 20 STORIES HIGH (Liverpool) 20 Stories High is an award-winning theatre company based in Toxteth, creating dynamic, challenging theatre which attracts new, young audiences while pushing the boundaries of what is theatre.

JUNCTION 25 (Glasgow) Formed in 2005, Junction 25 began as a response to a feeling about the need to represent the voices of young people in contemporary performance.
