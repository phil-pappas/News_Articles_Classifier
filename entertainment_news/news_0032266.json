Her parents' lawyer Tamar Arminak confirmed the news to PEOPLE on Monday, October 12. According to the lawyer, the \" Hairspray \" actress is \"doing great.\" \"We are all so proud of her, and can't wait to see her amazing designs on the runway someday,\" the lawyer said. Amanda first enrolled in courses at FIDM back in January 2014. She stopped attending classes in August 2014 before her DUI arrest in September. A former classmate of Amanda told the site last year that despite rumors of the \" Easy A \" actress being kicked out of the school, she \"wasn't out of control and she never threw a fit.\" Another student said Amanda stopped taking classes after a skin procedure. \"She had all plans to finish school, but she had a few procedures done and didn't want to be in public at FIDM,\" the second student said. \"She hated going to school.\" In June 2015, Amanda's attorney David Esquibias said his client \"is doing great. She appreciates all of the love and support she receives from family, friends and fans.\" Amanda made a return to Twitter in August, posting a picture of her with designer Michael Costello at a Los Angeles gala. \"Me and the fabulous Michael Costello (I'm wearing one of his beautiful gowns) at the SOAR Los Angeles Gala!\" she wrote alongside the shot.
