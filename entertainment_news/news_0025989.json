Then they try to assemble teams that earn the most points based on real-life stats in a given period of time with a certain percentage of top finishers earning a payout. \nEntry fees on DraftKings range from 25 cents to more than $5,000. Some prizes top $1 million. \nDraftKings and FanDuel say the sites provide games of skill and not of chance and are therefore protected by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act established in 2006, which has language protecting fantasy sports. \nThe games are legal in 45 states. \nOn Thursday, Nevada's Gaming Control Board issued a notice saying the sites must stop offering their contests to residents in the state effective immediately. Operators face felony fines and 10 years in prison. \nRegulators said the sites can apply for licenses. \n\"Since offering (daily fantasy sports) in Nevada is illegal without the appropriate license, all unlicensed activities must cease and desist from the date of this notice,\" their decision said.
