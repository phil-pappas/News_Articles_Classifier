While he misses being live at the scene of breaking international news, he’s looking forward to a different sort of thrill and some great banter on the Weekend Today set.\nBut that doesn’t mean he has aspirations to one day work alongside Karl on the weekday edition. “I don’t know about that,” he said of sharing the desk with Karl. He starts the new role this weekend.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d00cbd0cd81a9bf4c7f4da66c8911277", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c72bc460f0cb926fdddb1241a7e85f4a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d013b61afa3dd07df6c3fffecc4c4f85", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2b34476e9bf985edaf43a927b79979b7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/77dfd1e8a93bbb19c1bf6c765c006342", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/879fe04d7025a96b1806c04473ea5f29", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-24T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:55:47.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
