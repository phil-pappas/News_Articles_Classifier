Watch the film.\"\nThe film tells all sides - be it the police's investigation, the CBI case, and even the accounts of the parents. It is based on hard facts and not hearsay. To the average individual who has followed this case, I would say - since you do not have the time and patience to go through the court records, watch this movie.\nShree Paradhar, Aarushi's Aunt\n\"Watch it to realise how they could be any of us.\"\nWe feasted like vultures on the murders, the truth be damned. I want people to watch the film and realise how Rajesh and Nupur Talwar were just ordinary urban Indians - they could be any of us. I want people to see how easily they were manipulated by the narratives fed to them.\nFiza Jha, Aarushi's classmate\n\"It's about developing a sense of questioning.\"\nA debate after the film, as opposed to a value judgement, is important. It's really not about ascertaining what happened, or who the culprits are. It's about developing a sense of questioning of where we get our facts from, how to ensure accountability of systems like the police and CBI, if justice can ever be granted in this case, and how to create a society where this cannot recur.\nKiran S, SSP Noida\n\"For a cop, a film like this is quite intriguing.\"\nThe Talwar murder case hit the national conscience. It happened around the time I joined the IPS. Eight years on, I am now posted as SSP of Noida, so definitely I would like to know what they are showing in the film. Moreover, for a cop, a film based on a real crime incident is quite intriguing.\nPrashant Mathur, senior advocate, Allahabad HC\n\"Of course, I am intrigued by the film - the case was tried in Allahabad.\"\nOf course, I am intrigued by the film. The case itself was tried in Allahabad and I had colleagues who were involved in it. I watched it from the sidelines so I have a fair idea. It would be interesting to see how the filmmakers have shown the legal process and the investigations here. Mostly, Hindi cinema tends to be overdramatic in dealing with police investigations and the judiciary, but since this is based on a real incident, I'm hoping there would be some sense of realism here. I'm sure they will dramatise it for the big screen, but I want to see if they have managed to strike a credible balance between drama and reality.\nGovan Mehta, Aarushi's senior\n\"We'll know the truth through this film.\"\nWe walked from DPS Noida to her house and we also marched at Jantar Mantar then - we wanted the truth to come out. I have seen all this happening in front of my eyes. We were so angry with what had happened... years have passed but it has remained the same way. I am glad that Vishal Bhardwaj has decided to make a film on this issue because now we will know the truth, which has been hidden for so long, through this film. I am going to watch the movie today.\nLata Chitnis, mother of Nupur Talwar\n\"Want to see how they've portrayed our story.\"\nI will go to watch the movie with my husband and a group of friends. I want to see how they have portrayed our story. But I've heard that unlike the book, the film does not draw a conclusion and has not touched the trial proceedings. I want to understand how close it is to reality.\nNiyati Mehta, Aarushi's friend\n\"People will start questioning things now.\"\nI am sure it is a good movie. It might be in favour of Uncle and Aunty, or it might not. Honestly, it's a good thing that the film has been made on the incident, because maybe the truth can come out. Now, people will start questioning things, maybe we will start getting answers. We were just responding to what was being told to us, so for the public, it is good that a film has been made. But I don't have the guts to see the movie - whenever the trailer comes on television, I just switch it off, because in the trailer they have adapted the same scene (the scene of the killing). I can't go through it again.\nSavita Mehta, the Talwars' neighbour\n\" Hum logon ko abhi bhi fark padta hai .\"\nI never met Aarushi, but I knew the Talwars through common friends, and both my sons were friends with Aarushi. They were in the same group and used to hang out together. Log kehte hain ki itne saal baad kise fark padta hai. Hum logon ko bilkul fark padta hai. I have monitored the case closely because my boys were very upset - they participated in all the marches. I want to watch the movie because I want to know how close Meghna Gulzar has been able to come to reality. It was such a sad and unfortunate incident. The film might throw some light on questions that have remained unanswered so far.\nSanjna Dua, Aarushi's friend\n\"I want to see how close to reality everything in the film is.\"\nI would want to watch the movie because I would actually want to see people's reactions to it. I would love to know what the filmmakers are trying to convey, or if they have arrived at any conclusion about this apparently unsolvable mystery. I'd like to see how they have portrayed Aarushi and how close to reality everything is. And I sincerely I hope I get an answer and some closure about this case as well.\nKK Manan, chairman, Delhi bar council\n\"Let's see how the film presents a twisted case.\"\nI have heard about the film Talvar, and what I noticed was the change in the spelling of the title, but everyone knows that it is based on the Aarushi Talwar murder case. I would like to watch the film and see how it presents this very twisted case. There have been films made on real cases like the Jessica Lal murder case, but No One Killed Jessica came and went. People watched the film and forgot about it. What is to be seen now is how this case is presented in this film and whether it leaves an impact on the audience's mind. I haven't discussed the film so far with other lawyers, but I would like to know their views as well.\nListen to songs of Talvar on Gaana.com\nArvind Gaur, theatre director, one of whose plays had a section on the Aarushi murder case\n\"Will see how real-life characters are portrayed.\"\nThe Noida double murder case was a tragic incident. The case is still a mystery. The reason I will go to watch the film is to see how the film has portrayed so many real-life characters. Moreover, I have heard that its presentation style is similar to Rashomon, a film that I saw as a kid and which has stayed with me since. I believe only this case, which has so many known and unknown aspects, could have been presented in a Rashomon style. But most importantly, be it Nirbhaya, Aruna Shanbaug or Aarushi Talwar, inke vishay mein baat hoti rehni chahiye, aur hamari koshish yeh ho ki koi aur aise haadse na ho.\nVikas*, Aarushi's schoolmate\n\"I just hope the movie gives people a reason to at least listen to uncle and aunty.\"\nAs her friend, I expect that she shouldn't be presented in a negative light just because there were some conjectures about her character by some CBI officer, which haven't even been proven. And thanks to the media, people now think that she was a 'characterless' girl. I am as clueless about what happened as anyone else, but that doesn't mean I draft theories in my own head and then defame someone who cannot even protect herself anymore.That's all I expect from the movie. Being a law student, I know the case has a lot of loopholes, but I can't believe that uncle and aunty (the Talwars), or in fact any parents, would do that to their only daughter. Also, I have seen them together; I know how they were. I just hope the movie gives people a reason to at least listen to uncle and aunty and their side of the story. The media does have a great impact - it forces people to think in one particular manner, and that's exactly what happened. I hope the movie goes into all these aspects.\nREAD: â€‹Everything you need to know about 'Talvar'\nVikas*, Aarushi's schoolmate\n\"The film will stir a debate.\"\nI grew up with this case. At school, we would discuss it at length and try to figure out what really happened to her. She was a batch junior, but I knew her. When I found out that she had passed away, I didn't react because I didn't know how to. But it escalated after that. The 'trial by media' happened and we all watched as her parents were declared guilty by the news channels. That scared us. We'd go back and see our parents differently each day. It's what everyone spoke about at school. Finally, it died down. But it never went away. Relatives kept asking if we knew anything new, and then they grew bored too. I want to watch it, but not because it gives you an insight into the case. I know it's inconclusive and only talks about all the possible scenarios. I want to watch it because it might help bring the case back into the public space. I think the Talwars did not kill Aarushi and that the judiciary went with the popular opinion. Maybe this will help create a debate and something good might come of it. Even if they are guilty, we will have answers. We will finally know, perhaps, after all the debates.\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWatch: All about the Noida Double Murder case, explained in 2 minutes!\nPiku Amazon.in : INR 340.00 Buy now ", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/album/talvar", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PtDjq-BAQvU", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "http://www.amazon.in/Piku-Amitabh-Bachchan/dp/B010SDQ98K%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB010SDQ98K", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cx6gmVjuL._SL160_.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:16:38.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
