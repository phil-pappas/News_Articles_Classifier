Now, many workshops and tablereadings later, it opens WaterTower’s 2015-16 season, and the excitement is palpable.\nThe plot, which involves the infamous Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper, defies simple synopsis. What is clear, however, is that WaterTower has assembled some of the best talent around in front of and behind the scenes, from the star roles to the ensemble and the design team that has been working feverishly to conjure a world that meshes the 19th century with our own. Kate Galvin, associate producer at the 11th Hour Theatre Company in Philadelphia, is directing, and there’ll be a Producers’ Circle Gala Preview on Oct. 4, with the opening Oct. 5.\nOct. 2-25 at WaterTower Theatre, 15650 Addison Road, Addison. $20-$40. 972-450-6232. watertowertheatre.org.\nFollow Nancy Churnin on Twitter at @nchurnin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:08:50.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
