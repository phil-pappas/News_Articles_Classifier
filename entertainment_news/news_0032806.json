If you’re just wearing a pair of shorts, it’s hard to fake. We carefully choreograph the fights but you have to have the physical vocabulary, if you can’t throw jabs… \n“I’m not saying we are fantastic but we are really trying. Every free minute we get we are doing training, boxing or jiu jitsu, it’s constant.” \nMatt added that the competition between the members of the cast spurs them on.

We drive each other, there is a real ethic among the ranks. \n“Our first season motto was ‘all in, all the time’, the second season was ‘unreasonable commitment’. You can’t ever let up because the minute you do, you see one of your beautiful co-workers sprinting past you.” Share article \nKingdom has returned for a second series on US screens.
