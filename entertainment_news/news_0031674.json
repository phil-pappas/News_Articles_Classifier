The proof is in the hairline: Notice the red line that goes from the Us cover to Ross on the bottom right. A cautious observer could see how the hairline might look like Ross’ than Stewart’s.\nThe photos of Stewart and Sanders were totally staged, because Stewart is actually a lesbian. One commenter even suggested that she had a fling with Charlize Theron during the filming of “Snow White and the Huntsman.” If you look closely, you can just feel the sexual tension in this photo of the two during press rounds for the film. Kristen Stewart blatantly hooked up with Sanders in public to rid herself of a fake public relations relationship with Pattinson. Allegedly, their relationship was created for the sake of the “Twilight” franchise and now that it is over, Stewart no longer wants to be linked with him.\nAlas, “Twilight” fans, it seems that the substantiated reports in People and Us are true, given that Stewart all but verified that the photos are real.\n*UPDATE : Now that he’s been caught with his pants down, Sanders is really super sorry about it and has issued a statement : “I am utterly distraught about the pain I have caused my family. My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this together.”\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/#!/TaylorBiglerDC", "http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20614764,00.html", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyCaller"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:48:13.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
