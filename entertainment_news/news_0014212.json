Each of the 25 films shortlisted is held to the same standard — the director must deliver a complete story in exactly one minute: Filminute.com\nLeveraging social media, FILMINUTE has become one of the most accessible film festivals in the world, attracting submissions each year from over 65 countries and audiences in over 125 countries. 17 countries are represented in the competition this year: Brazil, Chile, Denmark, France (5), Germany, India, Iran (2), Ireland, Martinique, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom (3), Uruguay, and the USA (2).\nLast year’s Best Filminute winner TUCK ME IN (director Ignacio. F. Rodó, SPAIN 2014) generated more than 5 million views. “Any filmmaker would be thrilled to reach that large an audience, not just for a short film, but for any film,” said John Ketchum, Filminute’s co-founder and head of jury. Ketchum and the Filminute team see many reasons why several films from this year’s shortlist could achieve the same level of success. “We live in an era where filmmakers have access to a global audience, hungry for stories that resonate at a global level. As we’ve seen, filmmakers who grasp this can now find untold levels of international success and accelerate their careers with a one-minute film.”\nBefitting this year’s anniversary run of the festival, Filminute has assembled a jury of industry heavyweights. Academy Award-winning Hollywood film producer and Women In Film president Cathy Schulman leads the list. She is joined by FIPRESCI General Secretary and renowned film critic/author Klaus Eder, as well as Saatchi & Saatchi Executive Chairman and best-selling author Kevin Roberts. Both Eder and Roberts are returning to jury the 10th anniversary edition after serving on the 2007 jury. They are joined by the inaugural BestFilminute winner, Anton Groves, LINE (UK/ Romania 2006), and by last year’s big winner, Ignacio F. Rodó (Spain 2014).\nThe “BEST FILMINUTE” prize and 5 Commendations will be awarded by the FILMINUTE jury. The public at large is invited to view, share, comment upon, and rate all 25 films. Everyone is also entitled to a single vote for the film they feel deserves the People’s Choice award.\nVoting is open until September 30th. The FILMINUTE winners and awards will be announced on October 7.\nFor more information including past Filminute winners see Filminute.com\nAbout Filminute\nFilminute is the international one-minute film festival that challenges filmmakers, writers, animators, artists, designers, and creative producers to develop and submit the world's best one-minute films.
