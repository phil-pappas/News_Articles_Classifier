It's unbelievable.\" \nSmith is the first solo male British act to perform the opening number for a James Bond film since 1965, when Tom Jones was heard over the credits for Thunderball. \nSmith's song, a mournful ballad, divided opinion when it was unveiled last week, with critics labelling it both \"bland\" and \"beautiful\". \n\"When the song came out I was so nervous,\" the singer said. \"It's impossible to bring out a Bond song that pleases everyone. \n\"Everyone's had mixed reviews when they bring one out, but the charts don't lie and people seem to love it and enjoy it and that's just the most magical thing.\" \nWriting's On The Wall follows the success of Adele's Skyfall, which won a Grammy, an Oscar, a Brit Award and a Golden Globe. \nHer song failed to reach the top of the charts because it was released on a Wednesday - meaning Swedish House Mafia's Don't You Worry Child prevailed, thanks to a 48-hour head start. \nDuran Duran's A View To A Kill reached number two on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985, while Paul McCartney and Wings' Live and Let Die only reached number seven. \nShirley Bassey's Goldfinger, possibly the most famous Bond song, was the singer's biggest hit in the US, peaking at number eight - but it only reached 21 in the UK.
