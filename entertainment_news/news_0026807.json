Depending on the school, the exact details of the medical program differ; however, most schools follow specific guidelines related to the medical field. Students in a medical school must complete undergraduate classwork and requirements before moving into more complex studies in a higher education. During their education, students determine their preferred area of study or specialization before they start so that they obtain the appropriate education for their preferences.\nMedical school provides an education that differs from other forms of higher education because it focuses on a variety of complicated illnesses, medical solutions and the history of medical treatments. It also allows students to practice with the supervision of a medical professional so that they gain experience handling the needs of patients in a medical setting.\nIn an upcoming segment of \"Voices In America\" with James Earl Jones, viewers will learn about medical school in the United States and the way that the education system changes to keep up with new technology, ideas and medical treatments. Consumers and potential students will also discover the potential challenges facing the education system and the way that students are managing the additional costs of long-term education.\n\"Voices In America\" is an independently produced public broadcast that does not have any affiliation with PBS or APT. It is independently broadcast to public stations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:15:47.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
