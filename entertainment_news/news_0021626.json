The city was in the hands of Houthi rebels, but the National Security Bureau was little changed, and Farran, a retired Marine and former assistant defense attache at the U.S. Embassy, was well known to local security officials. He said he regarded the watching eyes as routine, not threatening.\nFarran's company provided security services, including guards, to Western companies in Yemen. And he was one of very few Americans still willing to travel to the country after the Houthis toppled a U.S.-backed government.\nSix days after Farran arrived, Saudi Arabia launched an air campaign in an effort to dislodge the rebels, members of a Shiite sect that the Saudis say is backed by Iran. Farran, 54, was in a house owned by the British American Tobacco company, one of his clients, when the bombs began to fall. He was joined there by another American, Scott Darden, who worked for New Orleans-based Transoceanic Development, overseeing the transport of humanitarian supplies in Yemen.\nThe Saudi campaign, supported by the United States with intelligence and other assets, suddenly made any American in Sanaa deeply suspect. And Farran was about to begin a 177-day ordeal of sometimes savage beatings in a prison where his cellmates were al-Qaeda operatives.\n\"We used to call it one death for each day. You know how you get up and start a new day? Over there you wake up and wish you were dead again,\" said Farran, a Lebanese American dual national, in his first extensive interview since his release.\nSpeaking at a Middle Eastern restaurant and hookah lounge just outside Detroit in Dearborn Heights, where Farran lives, he provided a rare glimpse into the rule of the Houthis - the rebels who continue to control the levers of power in Yemen and have withstood six months of Saudi bombing.\nYemen's government accepts talks with Shiite rebels AHMED AL-HAJ Yemen has accepted an invitation from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for talks with Shiite Houthi rebels at the end of this month to discuss the implementation of a U.N. resolution aimed at ending months of heavy fighting, a spokesman said Monday. Government spokesman Rajeh Badi said officials...\nYemen has accepted an invitation from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for talks with Shiite Houthi rebels at the end of this month to discuss the implementation of a U.N. resolution aimed at ending months of heavy fighting, a spokesman said Monday. Government spokesman Rajeh Badi said officials...\n(AHMED AL-HAJ) On the night of March 27, nearly a dozen men - armed with American-made M-4 assault rifles and wearing crisp camouflage uniforms - stormed the villa. Farran recognized them as members of a counterterrorism unit, funded and equipped by the United States, that was built to fight al-Qaeda.\nNow they were commanded by three Houthis who wore keffiyeh scarves, Farran said.\nThe men confiscated the Americans' cellphones and computers and ransacked the villa as Farran and Darden sat at a table. They took more than $5,000 in cash that Farran had in his wallet. When the search was complete, the Americans were stripped to their underwear and T-shirts, blindfolded and shoved into separate, armored Toyota Land Rovers.\nDarden declined to discuss his detention. Through a spokesman, he said, \"I want to thank everyone who has supported me and my family the last six-plus months.\"\nAs he was being driven away, Farran wanted know where he was being taken. \"Don't ask,\" one of the Houthis said.\nYemen rebels release foreign hostages, including 2 Americans Associated Press Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels have released six foreign hostages, including two Americans, and flown them to the Gulf country of Oman, which helped negotiate their release, officials said Sunday.\nOman's Foreign Ministry said two Americans, three Saudis and a British citizen were released following...\nYemen's Shiite Houthi rebels have released six foreign hostages, including two Americans, and flown them to the Gulf country of Oman, which helped negotiate their release, officials said Sunday.\nOman's Foreign Ministry said two Americans, three Saudis and a British citizen were released following...\n(Associated Press) Farran began to worry he would be summarily executed. \"The thought did cross my mind,\" he recalled.\nAbout 30 minutes later, Farran, still blindfolded, was hustled into an interrogation room. His computer was on the table. The interrogator wanted to know the password to his e-mail account and his presence on social media, including Facebook.\n\"Why are you in Yemen?\" the interrogator asked.\nFarran explained his business in the country.\n\"You are a spy,\" the interrogator said.\nWhy had he arrived just before the bombing? Was he providing targeting information to the Americans, the interrogator asked, so the Saudis would know what to hit?\nFarran denied it.\n\"Liar,\" the interrogator said. And then someone started to slap him repeatedly and box his ears. Farran, still blindfolded, thought his head was going to explode. Eventually, he lost consciousness.\nFaking a heart attack\nFarran was dragged to a cell where he was given sweat pants and a shirt but no shoes. There was a faucet and a bucket to wash, a commode and a thin mattress. There were three meals a day, mostly stews and chilies, but Farran would lose more than 30 pounds while incarcerated. He had three cellmates, two of them medics in al-Qaeda's local affiliate, who told him he was in a prison on a military base they called \"Guantanamo Yemen.\"\nThree days later, Farran was blindfolded and taken back to the interrogation room, where he was told to sit on the floor. The same cycle of accusation and denial continued until Farran said he was told to stand. He was struck repeatedly with a heavy stick on the arms and legs. He was black and blue when he was returned to his cell.\nAnother beating followed a few weeks later before Farran's cellmates told him to feign heart trouble. It wasn't difficult. Farran, who had undergone triple bypass surgery, had been taking heart medication when he was detained.\nDays later, Farran faked a heart attack. He lay down on the floor and started breathing heavily and his cellmates banged on the door. The Yemenis took the \"old man,\" as they called him, to the hospital.\nFarran said he was taken in a van with Casey Coombs, an American journalist who was detained in May and was injured. \"He was in bad shape,\" Farran said.\nCoombs, who declined to be interviewed, was freed in June and flown to Oman.\nAt the hospital, Farran was given an electrocardiogram and prescribed his previous heart medication before he was returned to the prison.\nOn the runway\nFarran was moved to a different cell with a new group al-Qaeda prisoners. He described them as hard-core, and he worried that they might harm him. Farran, who speaks fluent Arabic, emphasized his Lebanese heritage, but that wasn't much better than saying he was American, because he is a Shiite; al-Qaeda is a Sunni terrorist group, and hostilities between the two branches of Islam run deep.\nBut the al-Qaeda prisoners were also curious about Farran. He told them about the Yemeni community in Dearborn. His cellmates thought all Muslims were mistreated in United States and could not pray freely there. Farran gently correctly them.\nHis cellmates never threatened him. In fact, at one point they said there was a rumor that al-Qaeda was planning to break them out and asked him if he would come. Farran seriously considered it, as his interrogators had threatened to \"disappear\" him.\n\"What choice did I have?\" he said. \"I would take my chances with them.\"\nWhen not chatting with members of al-Qaeda, Farran would pace in his cell for hours until his knees and back hurt. Finally, after 130 days of detention, he was allowed to go outside for one hour.\nThe guards took him to a small prison yard, where he saw sunlight and Darden for the first time since they were brought to the military base. They hugged and cried. Darden confided that he, too, had been beaten. Before going back to their cells, Darden, a Muslim convert, kissed Farran on his forehead as a sign of respect and devotion.\nAlthough the physical abuse ended, the interrogations continued, and the Houthis wanted Farran to sign a confession that he was spy.\n\"Nobody is asking about you,\" one interrogator said. \"You're on your own. You can make this easy or hard. Sign the confession and you can walk out of here.\"\nIn fact, a new Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell led by the FBI had been trying to secure his freedom, as had Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent with deep ties in Yemen, who had previously employed Farran in his international security firm, the Soufan Group.\nThere were about dozen interrogation sessions in all, Farran said, but by the end the Houthis had stopped accusing him of being a spy.\n\"Finally they gave up,\" he said. The last two times the Houthis questioned him, he said, they chewed khat together.\nThe Houthis have not said anything about the detention of the Americans, but Farran believes that diplomatic pressure, along with their conclusion that he was not a spy, led to his release.\nAbout a week after the final interrogation, the guards asked his shoe size, a clear sign to Farran that he was going home.\n\"I fell on the ground, \" Farran said. \"I was shocked. It's hard to believe. Everyday you pray for that moment.\"\nEven his al-Qaeda cellmates were happy for him. They were praising Allah, Farran said.\nWearing new shoes and clothes, Farran and Darden were driven to the airport on Sept. 20.\nFarran wondered: \"Is this happening? Am I really going home?\"\nThe two Americans boarded an Omani Air Force Boeing 737 first and were followed by a British-Somali citizen as well as four Saudis.\nScores of wounded Houthi fighters were also brought aboard, along with a delegation headed to talks in Oman.\nAnd then they waited. And waited. For hours. A third American - a Muslim convert who had been teaching English in Sanaa - was also supposed to be on the plane.\nU.S. officials implored the Omanis not to leave without the other American. But the Omanis said it was too dangerous to remain, and eventually the plane took off.\nThe third American is still in custody in Sanaa.\n Yemen Middle East", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ff3858/turbine/la-yemen-rebels-releases-americans-20150920", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56269a50/turbine/ct-us-marine-yemen-prison-20151020", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56269ac2/turbine/sns-bc-ml--yemen-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:07:09.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
