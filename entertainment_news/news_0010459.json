Throughout his career, he worked closely with Imperial Court de San Diego, Trevor Project and The Center, with his most recent post being the LGBT Outreach Liaison for Mental Health America (MHA) of San Diego County. In this position, he advocated for mental health sensitivity and workplace/school trainings to create safe spaces for LGBTQ employees and students.

Nicole Murray Ramirez will accept on behalf of Cunningham. Actor and activist Wilson Cruz will receive the Lincoln Aston Public Service Award. Named for the San Diego developer and philanthropist whose murder led to the establishment of The San Diego Human Dignity Foundation, the award honors a public figure who uses their celebrity to increase awareness of LGBT issues and encourage equality. Wilson Cruz \nCruz has most recently been seen as “Kenji Gomez-Rejon” on FOX television’s ensemble drama, “The Red Band Society,” starring Oscar winner, Octavia Spencer. Early in his career, Cruz won the hearts of audiences playing “Rickie Vasquez” on “My So Called Life.” It was the first openly gay teenager role to air on network primetime television. He has continued to earn fans and critical acclaim on television, film and stage. Cruz played the critically acclaimed role of “Angel” on Broadway and in the West Coast Premiere of the Pulitzer Prize and Tony award winning musical “RENT.” His portrayal earned him The Los Angeles Ovation Award and Dramalogue award. He also starred in “Tick, Tick, BOOM!” at the Westport Country Playhouse, West Coast Premiere and its First National Tour. On the frontlines of LGBT advocacy, Cruz recently served as the director of entertainment industry partnerships and national spokesperson for GLAAD, the nation’s leading LGBT media advocacy organization. “The individuals we will honor at our upcoming event embody the mission of the San Diego Human Dignity Foundation,” said John L. Brown, executive director, SDHDF. “Their work and dedication to equality, tolerance, wellness, well-being and human dignity transcends the LGBTQ communities, striving to bridge understanding throughout San Diego and beyond.” Each of the awards carries a $5,000 grant from The San Diego Human Dignity Foundation to the LGBT/HIV charity chosen by the award recipient or their designate. The charities selected will be announced at the Aston-Brooks Awards Gala on Nov. 7.

McArdle rocketed to stardom as Broadway’s original “Annie,” for which she was the youngest performer ever nominated for the Tony® Award for Best Actress in a Musical, winning both the Theatre World and Outer Critics’ Circle Awards for her performance. On Broadway, McArdle originated the roles of “Ashley” in “Starlight Express” and “Margy” in “State Fair” and was seen as “Belle” in “Beauty and the Beast” and as “Fantine” in “Les Miserables.” On tour she starred in “Jerry’s Girls,” “Les Miserables” as “Eponine,” “The Wizard of Oz,” “Cabaret” and “Peter Pan.” Andrea has performed in concert halls from Carnegie Hall to the best showrooms in Las Vegas to the MET Opera House and The White House.
