Speaking to Digital Spy, Bateman said that watching Heath Ledger's take on The Joker in The Dark Knight was a big influence on how he played Hyde. \"Jekyll is quite close to me, a little bit more shy. Whereas Hyde is a mish-mash of lots of things. I didn't realise I was borrowing it throughout the auditions – but Heath Ledger's Joker [was an influence].\"You love watching the Joker, and yes that's what I was doing, subconsciously that. I'd obviously seen it and it had embedded it self a little bit. A Clockwork Orange also has that sort of gross, wry smile, which you actually enjoy, weirdly enough. Audiences, we all love watching those characters. Hyde's a bit of a mish-mash of those alpha-male, slightly odd, wiry, nasty people that they've still got a twinkle in their eye.\"Bateman also said that he feels that UK television has a gap in the market for a superhero-fantasy series such as Jekyll and Hyde. © ITV / Steve Brown \"A lot of people have asked me what the show is like and I've tried to say Indiana Jones meets Sherlock meets Doctor Who meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it's all of them.\"It should be hopefully something the whole family can watch and get that sense of adventure and different monsters each time. The Doctor Who thing that we like, who's the guest monster, the person to fight, and what's their world? We've got that very much as well.\"He added that he was also thankful that he had 10 episodes to sink his teeth into, rather than a reduced number like other new shows. © Getty Images / Dave Benett \"There's a movement at the moment towards television, you've got all these Hollywood A-Listers - Matthew McConaughey, Kevin Spacey, they're more doing telly. Films, I don't know why, but they're feeling a bit more unsatisfying – if you do do a film you need to have a trilogy, or like the Bond films, they carry on going, or the Hunger Games, or even Star Wars.\"You still get brilliant films, but the development of characters that you get is huge. So we've got ten hours in season one and the time you get to take over it, it feels more real. In a film I'd have maybe four scenes to discover this thing inside me, and two scenes to come to terms with it, and then three to accept it and embrace it.\"Whereas with this, if you've got four episodes – you've got four hours – you've already got two movies worth of discovering, so as an actor I much prefer it to if they'd just made a Jekyll and Hyde movie.\"Richard E Grant and Natalie Gumede will also star in the 10-part series, which launches on Sunday, October 25 at 6.30pm on ITV.
