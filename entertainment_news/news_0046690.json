That's really all I said. I didn't say the film industry was ever going to end because of them.\"\nSpielberg continued by saying he felt that particular genre \"doesn't have the legs or the longevity of the Western, which was around since the beginning of film and only started to wither and shrivel in the '60s.\" Ending on a more hopeful note, he concluded that there's an audience for every kind of movie in 2015, which wasn't the case even five years ago.\n\"Now, these little movies are squeezing in and finding a birth next to these huge Queen Mary-type movies and they're able to find an audience, (or) enough of an audience to encourage the distributor and the film companies to finance more of them,\" Spielberg said. \"These are not just films like Bridge of Spies , but it's independent movies as well.\"\nConsidered one of the early pioneers of the blockbuster with franchises such as Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones , Spielberg has made an array of popcorn flicks and awards contenders throughout his career (most recently, Bridge , Lincoln and War Horse ).\nBridge had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival Sunday and opens nationwide Oct. 16.\n9 CONNECT 99 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1RpSBDI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795851346957567-GTY-491340634-76491576.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RpSBDI&text=Spielberg%20clarifies%20remarks%20on%20Hollywood%20%27implosion%27&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1RpSBDI", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ead2d677b8ae2296a088dcf0cb816530daa46a58/c=64-0-2314-3000&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795851346957567-GTY-491340634-76491576.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fe8876b3917c2f9c8e49ea83ab59cedc767e09b/r=317x400/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795851346957567-GTY-491340634-76491576.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RpSBDI&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/596e88388cc8d5715358137832c901ba5a96e91e/c=1314-0-3834-2520/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795717661578292-XXX-BRIDGEOFSPIES02-MOV-DCB-74793468.JPG", "http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/is-hollywood-model-doomed-steven-spielberg-and-george-lucas-think-so-20130815"], "published": "2015-10-05T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:56:04.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
