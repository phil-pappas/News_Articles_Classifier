The film not only gained attention owing to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan making a comeback to silver screen after a gap of 5 years but the fact that she chose a rather realistic role of a mother caught the peoples' attention. Now is Jazbaa the kind of movie we are expecting it to be? Read to find out. \nAishwarya Rai plays the role of Anuradha Varma, a successful lawyer by profession and also a single mother to Sanaaya (Sara Arjun) who fights cases for criminals and being an ambitious woman, she is guilt free of fighting cases for criminal until one day when it backfires. \nHer daughter, Sanaaya gets kidnapped and as ransom the criminals ask Anuradha to get rapist and murderer, Miyaaz Shaikh (Chandan Roy Sanyal) out of jail in four days. Yohan, a tainted cop played by Irrfan Khan is Anuradha's best friend and also the guy who helps her get the daughter back. \nShabana Azmi is seen essaying the role of the victim's daughter, against whom Anuradha is fighting the case against. \nWhile the plot of the movie is very unique and gripping, we can't really give it much credit for director Sanjay Gupta has just remade Korean movie Seven Days . While he has kept the essence of the story the same, making Jazbaa an edge of the seat thriller, he has taken the emotions a little overboard. \nScenes where we see Aishwarya cry for her daughter just don't seem to end, making the melodrama a little too much to handle. While at one point we do enjoy Irrfan Khan's dialogues, there are scenes where his dialogues would want to make you facepalm yourself. \nBut all these flaws get easily overlapped by this edge of the seat thriller which doesn't let go of your attention and interest even for seconds. \nAishwarya Rai Bachchan is made to seem like the star of the movie, while she has given her best and performed really well, barring some overacting scenes, she gets overtaken by others. Irrfan Khan stands out as the uber cool cop and his camaraderie with hyper active Aish is quite commendable. \nShabana Azmi too plays her role quite effortlessly while Chandhan could have done a better job. None the less, Irrfan and Shabana over take Aishwarya when it comes to performance in the movie. \nSanjay has managed to give an entertaining, gripping thriller to watch this weekend, with the stunning world beauty leading the story. \nSongs too are great and in sync with the theme. Hats off to Robin Bhatt and Kamlesh Pandey for their paisa vasool type dialogues. \nSanjay could have spared us the over exaggerated melodrama but at the end of the day, Jazbaa is a great weekend watch and entertaining movie that you will enjoy watching!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:08:59.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
