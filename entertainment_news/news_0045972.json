There's no timetable for when the decision will be made. \nThe investigation concerns an accusation by model Chloe Goins that Cosby drugged and abused her in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion in 2008. \nMore than 50 women have made sexual assault accusations against Cosby. His lawyers have denied sex assault accusations against the comedian in the past, and Cosby has never been criminally charged in connection with any of the allegations. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
