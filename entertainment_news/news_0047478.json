But the department said in a statement that it has determined the purpose was entertainment. \n\"The investigation revealed that the film was made by members of an early 1990s rap group no longer in fashion,\" the statement said, and was \"posted on social media to ignite a comeback.\" \nPolice have not released the name of the group or the names of the suspects. \nThe brief, soundless video is shot from inside a car that is parked behind a police cruiser. It shows the police car, then moves to the person's lap and shows the gun, which the person then hides under a bag or piece of clothing. It then moves back to the police car, where it shows a uniformed officer get out and walk away. It's not clear when it was shot. \nDetectives identified the vehicle and the three suspects who were inside, police said. \nChief Charlie Beck said at a police commission meeting that a secondary suspect had been arrested and a primary suspect was negotiating to surrender. \nOne of the three men had a previous weapons conviction, the police statement said. An arrest warrant for carrying a firearm in a vehicle with a prior felony and a search warrant were served for him Tuesday morning, police said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:45:18.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
