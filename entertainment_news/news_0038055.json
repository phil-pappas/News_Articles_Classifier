Like, a lot. \nSo when she stopped by \"Conan\" this week, she just had to share her screaming secrets with Conan and Andy. \n\"Well, it's just like a primal scream, you know. It's very, it makes you feel good, makes you feel confident, just to let it out, let all that anger out,\" Paige explained on \"Conan.\" \n\"One, two, three! AHH!\" all three of them screamed. \nWhoa, looks like Paige might have met her match there! \nBut we're guessing that's about the only thing Conan could beat her at. She is, of course, a two-time WWE Divas Champion. (Video via WWE ) \nYou can see Paige and other WWE stars during the Hell in a Cell event, which airs this weekend on pay-per-view.
