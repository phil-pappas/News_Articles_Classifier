The wonderful Martin Clunes is back, doling out treatments and stony glares as the imperious, socially challenged physician to the colorful residents of a picturesque English town in a new seventh series of the show that Acorn TV starts streaming on Monday, Oct. 5. If the early episodes we’ve seen are any indication, Martin and estranged wife Louisa are still sorting out their troubled marriage, and the other town regulars are back with comical new misadventures. (And in some future episode, Sigourney Weaver makes a guest appearance.) Acorn TV streams a steady diet of new and vintage series from Great Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, at the bargain price of $4.99 a month ( acorn.tv ). \nMisha Berson: mberson@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:15:41.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
