Which do you think we'll be putting to use? Right or left?\" \nBefore, Seewald even hinted that she might be having twins, but she seems to have given up on that ruse, referring to the singular \"baby\" several times. That hasn't stopped her fans from commenting, \"Both,\" on the photo of the two outfits, though. \nIt looks like we'll find out soon enough: TLC will air a special on Seewald's pregnancy.
