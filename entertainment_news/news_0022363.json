They'll also tour a USO center that supports wounded or ill service members, their families and caregivers. In addition, they'll watch a sports event similar to those featured in the prince's Invictus Games. \nHarry will be in the U.S. to promote the sporting event for wounded service personnel. The 2016 Invictus Games are slated for Orlando, Florida. \nVice President Joe Biden's wife, Jill, led a delegation to the inaugural Invictus Games in London last year as part of the Joining Forces military initiative she leads with Mrs. Obama. \nHarry visited the White House in 2013. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:24:50.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
