He breaks his parole in hopes of starting a new life, initiating a life-long struggle for redemption. Valjean is then relentlessly pursued by police inspector Javert, who refuses to believe he can change his ways. Finally, during the Paris student uprising of 1832, Javert must confront his ideals after Valjean spares his life and saves that of the student revolutionary who has captured the heart of Valjean's adopted daughter.\nCaurie Putnam - Brockport MORE FROM BrockportBlog Halloween happenings in the Brockport area Caurie Putnam - Brockport, ROC | 5:15 PM Oct 19, 2015 #ROCtheWinter: Would you like some gloves with that morning frost?
