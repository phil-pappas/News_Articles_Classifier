The fourth time may be the charm for N.W.A.\nNominated for a fourth consecutive year for entry into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame as one of 15 potential inductees Thursday, this go-around has a different vibe for the seminal rap group.\nThat's because N.W.A., and its real-life surviving members Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella and MC Ren, have gotten a huge boost in exposure from the success of this year's biopic about the band, \"Straight Outta Compton.\" (Co-founder Eazy-E died of complications from AIDS in 1995.)\nRELATED: JANET JACKSON, N.W.A., DEEP PURPLE AMONG ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME NOMINEES\nAl Pereira/Getty Images Rappers MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre of the rap group NWA pose for a portrait in 1991 in New York, New York. \"I am humbled by the nomination and recognition of NWA's contribution to music and culture by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,\" Ice Cube said in a statement to the Daily News. \"It has been an incredible year for us as a group, for our loyal fans and in helping us to all keep Eazy-E's memory alive.\"\nThe movie, which chronicles the band's rise from the streets of gang-plagued Compton to superstardom, earned $160.7 million at the box office.\nMore than 800 music industry insiders will vote on the inductees, with an online fan ballot also counting towards the final vote.\nJaimie Trueblood/AP From l., Aldis Hodge, as MC Ren, Neil Brown, Jr. as DJ Yella, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E, O’Shea Jackson, Jr. as Ice Cube and Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, in ‘Straight Outta Compton.’ The film may boost the real-life N.W.A.’s prospects of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. But while the group has come much closer to mainstream recognition with the movie and the solo success of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, N.W.A. isn't a lock for induction. The band's association with the L.A. gang scene of the late '80s and early '90s could turn off older, predominantly white voters.\nFive of the 15 hopefuls are expected to make the final cut for April's induction ceremony in New York, which will be televised on HBO at a later date.\nRelated Stories N.W.A. gets its due on film Janet Jackson, Steve Miller among Rock Hall of Fame nominees Tags: ice cube", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:13:31.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
