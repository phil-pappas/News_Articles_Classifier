To do just that, instead of playing dress-up, eating lots of candy and doing lots of home cooking , Memorex in partnership with the creators of SHARKNADO has created a contest inviting consumers to “make-a-scene” with actor Joey Lawrence for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to break into Hollywood.\nOne lucky Grand Prize winner will win a walk-on role in a 2016 production by The Asylum – the creators of SHARKNADO and Z Nation – plus a 55” 4K UHDTV, an invitation to audition for a speaking role and schedule a screenwriter pitch meeting with The Asylum producers.\nThe “Memorex Lives!” video contest is simple. Just visit www.memorexlives.com , and review the video clips featuring actor/singer/producer Joey Lawrence, who plays the role of superhero action star Brock Firestone, leader of “The Resistance” against The Evil Empire.\nThen, film your own hilarious or haunting clips on your iPhone, webcam or Red camera and upload them into the film editor.
