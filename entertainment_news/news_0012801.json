Tom Young, R-Aiken, led Tuesday’s public meeting to gather testimony on his proposal, S. 868. The bill would place two hurdles in front of pipeline companies seeking to use eminent domain to take people’s land, the seven-member Public Service Commission and the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control. Both agencies would function as gatekeepers under the legislation, and both would have to OK a pipeline company’s application to use eminent domain.\nHowever, Savannah Riverkeeper Tonya Bonitatibus laid out a different way to thwart the company’s efforts.\n“It’s just as simple as going in (to) redefine a regulated utility versus a non-regulated entity,” she said.\n“Making it so that if you are issued or allowed to use eminent domain in South Carolina, you fall under the regulations and oversight of our commission, of our laws, and you don’t fall outside of that. Kinder Morgan clearly falls outside of that.”\nAs for fears that anti-pipeline efforts would raise the hackles of offshore-drilling advocates, she said the issues could be distinctly defined to “leave offshore drilling for another day.”\nLike Bonitatibus, most of the nearly dozen who spoke Tuesday had also testified during last month’s public meeting in north Augusta.\nLawmakers also grappled with an apparently widespread misconception that the bill is intended to grant corporations the authority to take people’s land against their wishes. In actuality, current law may already provide that power to Kinder Morgan.\nThose at the heart of the legislative discussions acknowledge that the current state law is ambiguous. An Attorney General’s office released a non-binding opinion over the summer that revealed slack in the current law that could be exploited in court to allow Kinder Morgan to use eminent domain.\nAt issue is a 360-mile petroleum pipeline the company is trying to build through Georgia and South Carolina, ending in Jacksonville. A legal challenge in Georgia has frozen the project for now. But South Carolina officials are hoping to bolster state law before any legal conflicts arise to menace property owners.\nWhile some had assumed Young’s bill would apply to the Kinder Morgan pipeline project, if it was passed into law, even that may not be a sure thing.\n“Ultimately it depends on the intent of the General Assembly,” Young said.\n“My intent would be for it to apply to Kinder Morgan on this project. Whether or not they (Kinder Morgan) could get ahead of the game, I can’t predict that.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ad13t3f_5.JPG", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ad13t3f_5.JPG", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:10:22.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
