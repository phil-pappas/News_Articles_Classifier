They find peace and strength in what they pretend to believe in. Building homes for pixies they never see. Still this daily duty is dedicated to keeping these tiny friends safe and dry. Food and water are left each evening to ensure they never leave. But children grow, and life is full of changes. Eventually the pixies do leave. Peace slips away as life begins. Things become complicated. Innocence is lost. There are choices, many forks in the road. When you end up on the wrong path, it is cluttered and full of obstacles. When the pixies left, the road became rocky, and life became harder with each poor choice. The child is lost, and the adult who emerges scrambles to find a replacement for the peace once known.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “When the Pixies Left” at bookstores everywhere or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
