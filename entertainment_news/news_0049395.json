The teenage Dan Dan (Huiwen Zhang) is a dancer who hopes to become the lead ballerina in a major production. Her mother is a teacher called Yu (the venerable Li Gong); her father, Lu (Chen Daoming), a onetime professor, has been a political prisoner for a decade.\nAs the film begins, Yu and Dan Dan are told Lu has escaped prison and is on the run. The authorities rightly suspect Lu will try to reconnect with his wife and child. Loyal to the party and not having seen her father since she was a toddler, Dan Dan has no allegiance to the man. So when she finds him outside their apartment, trying to get Yu to open the door, she leaves to turn him in.\nLu slips a note for Yu under the door, asking her to meet him at a train station. When she goes to the meeting the next day, Dan Dan follows. In a grand, sweeping action sequence, Lu is recaptured and Yu is thrown to the ground, head bloodied.\nThree years later, the Cultural Revolution ends and Lu is released. But Lu returns home to find Yu no longer recognizes him and can barely function, while Dan Dan has quit the ballet and is working in a factory. Thus begins Lu’s long task of re-uniting a family he barely recognizes.\nAside from the train station scene, “Coming Home” isn’t the sort of spectacle Zhang is known for. It’s intimate, delicate material filmed with careful attention to character and nuance. Yet it is every bit as full as his action films, a modern yet timeless tragedy that’s desperate, sad and rich with devotion.\ntlong@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/toomuchTomLong \n\n‘Coming Home’ \nGRADE: B+ \nRated PG-13 for some thematic material\nRunning time: 109 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:23:28.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
