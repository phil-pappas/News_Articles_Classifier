Here's the poster for my official documentary in cinemas soon. What do you think? \" \nImage Courtesy: Instagram \nHe also seems to be using his son to help him promote the movie. He posted a picture of his son looking through the camera lens. His little sons aspires to be a goal keeper, though father doesn't seem too happy about that! \nImage Courtesy: Instagram \nThe movie makers and television shows have always been keen on knowing more about these Football champions. One such Footballer was Wayne Rooney who was interviewed by Gary Lineker at his home for the BBC. \nRooney's interview was screened on the television 9 years ago and he was known regionally. Ronaldo is rising to fame in Hollywood and globally through the movies. \nOther than all the rivalry, competition, spirit of winning and losing and all the technicalities of the game, the football fans can also look forward to witness the other side of their champion, Ronaldo's life in the movie 'Ronaldo' that's hitting the screens on the 9th of November this year. \nBehold Ronaldo's fans, there's more to come soon!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:52:55.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
