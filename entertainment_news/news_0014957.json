Judge Alison Arms dismissed the charges after initially reduced the couple's bail to $50,000. Alison said she found no probable cause to keep Randy and Evy in custody. The judge told the couple to stay in Vermont while facing fugitive charges after being released from custody. The ruling, however, has not deterred Santa Barbara County D.A. Office from seeking extradition. \"We were prepared for this possibility,\" the D.A.'s office said in a statement. The office has started the process of seeking an extradition warrant or governor's warrant. The process could take 60 to 90 days. Randy told reporters after his release, \"I'm glad that the judge was fair and she took the time to get her decision correct... As far as the overall case back in California goes, we've always said that we're innocent.\" The \"Independence Day\" actor said he and his wife planned to stay in Vermont. He even wanted to join a local fire department. Randy and Evi were arrested on Friday, October 9 as \"fugitives from justice\" and \"subject to extradition\" when trying to cross the border from Canada into the United States. The pair are wanted in Santa Barbara, California on felony charges related to a 2010 incident in which they were found squatting in a guesthouse of their old home. They are facing charges of vandalism, unauthorized entry into a dwelling, and failure to appear in court. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:23:55.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
