Pic/Santa Banta  \nSources close Kim and her husband Kanye West have told tmz.com that doctors have back-timed the date of conception and the couple has been told their son will be born on Christmas.\nAccording to reports, there are some reasons why the doctors are convinced about Kim's date of conception.\nKim suffers from placenta accreta, a serious pregnancy condition where the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall, which could be dangerous. Hence, the doctors plan on a natural birth on Christmas Day.\nHowever, a C-section is deemed necessary on that day if she doesn't give birth beforehand. It will be done for safety reasons.\nThe couple have already booked a Deluxe Maternity Suite at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:46:58.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
