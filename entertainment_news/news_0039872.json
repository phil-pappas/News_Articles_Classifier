They also will remember the hoverboard sequence, with McFly being chased by Biff and his gang, all on flying skateboards.\nThese may never go beyond the prototype stage. But the ministry has issued tongue-in-cheek rules on their use to mark \"Back to the Future\" day. Its website describes a hoverboard as a \"small vehicle for use outside of the road\" and says a special license is needed for rocket-driven \"Pit Bull\" models.\nIt urges hoverboarders to wear helmets and to \"be aware ... of possible additional regulations\" for use over water.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:39:24.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
