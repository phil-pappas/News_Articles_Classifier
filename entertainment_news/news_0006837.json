The Jenner-Kardashian family decided to head home as Kim Kardashian had an appointment with her pregnancy specialist who flew to L.A. just to meet her. The pregnant reality TV star requires more treatment for her current pregnancy. As previously reported, Kim is suffering from placenta accreta , a condition in which her placenta is growing too deep into her uterus. Kim had previously opened up about the consequence of her condition, \"If the placenta grows a little bit deeper than it did last time, then they are prepared to have my uterus removed.\" The family members joining Kim to leave for L.A. included momager Kris Jenner , Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner . Kris, Kim and Khloe had been on Lamar's bedside since Tuesday night, after Lamar was found unconscious at a brothel in Pahrump, Nevada. Kourtney and Kylie joined them on Wednesday. According to TMZ, the famous family will go back to Las Vegas in the weekend to be with the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star. Meanwhile, Kendall Jenner , who has been in London for her runway, is reportedly on her way to Las Vegas to accompany Khloe. The famous family aside, Lamar's pal Kobe Bryant fired back at Master P who said Kobe and the Kardashians' visits to Lamar were just for publicity . In a tweet posted on Thursday, the 37-year-old basketball athlete obliquely called the rapper \"insensitive.\" Kobe wrote, \"When WE feel the need to question the support of others in moments as critical as a life hanging in the balance, then we must question the kind of culture we have created that has led US to such insensitive suspicion.\" — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) 15 Oktober 2015 \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:21:48.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
