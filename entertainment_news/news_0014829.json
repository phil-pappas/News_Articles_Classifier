(AP Photo/Valeria Fernandez) \nNOGALES, Sonora, Mexico (AP) — A California-based artist is leading an effort to paint the border fence that divides the U.S. and Mexico to make it blend in with the landscape. \nAna Teresa Fernández and a group of 30 artists and painters began their work on the border fence in Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona, on Tuesday. \nFernández wants to make a political statement about the border by painting it blue that it appears to be invisible. \nFernández did a similar project in 2012 on the Tijuana, Mexico, beach, risking arrest. This time, she has permission from Mexican authorities to paint the fence from the Sonora side of the border. \nBut organizers say they’re not sure how U.S. authorities will respond to people using ladders on the border fence. The painting will continue throughout the day. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:01:41.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
