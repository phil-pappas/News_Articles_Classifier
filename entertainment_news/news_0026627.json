Apprentice winners: Stella English, Tim Campbell and more - where are they now? Share \nThe boardroom battle is back as this year’s Apprentice kicks off. \nOnce again Lord Sugar is back with his trusty advisors – Baroness Brady and new panel member, Claude Littner. \nBut what has happened to those who’ve heard those two magical words, ‘You’re Hired’, from Lord Sugar? \nWe take a look at where the past winners are now. 1. Mark Wright- series 10 Mark Wright ( Ian West/PA Archive/PA Images) \nNot him of TOWIE fame, but rather the one who clinched the first prize with his SEO business idea. In a recent interview with LondonLovesBusiness, he revealed his business has “turned over a million in a year”. He also spoke about working for Lord Sugar, saying: “He’s really hands-on, I speak to him at least once a week and for a full day once a month. When we first started he was on my case every day, but now we’re off and sailing really well he sort of leaves me to steer the ship a bit more.” 2.
