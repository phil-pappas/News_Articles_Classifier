She knows it's just a silly article in the press. \n\"Everyone that is a part of ‘Strictly’ knows that. There's no reassurance needed, she's so nice to everyone and I just think it's crazy for someone to ever think that of such a kind and friendly woman.\" \nThe reports first emerged last week, when a source was quoted as telling The Sun: “She's a prima donna, but she's very sweet when the cameras are on.\" MORE 'STRICTLY':", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:19:27.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
