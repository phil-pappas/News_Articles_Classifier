That’s the conceit monster-master Guillermo del Toro playfully plays with in the gothic horror romance “Crimson Peak.” It’s a visual stunner that’s a showcase for the director’s twisted sense of humor. It’s also the most fun I’ve had at the movies in weeks. While it’s not as frightening as other del Toro offerings, there’s no escaping the constant anticipation of having the pants scared off you. It lurks around every atmospheric corner. A creepy and sometimes cheeky grownup fairytale with ghosts and gore, “Crimson Peak” fits plum in del Toro’s dark wheelhouse, alongside “Pan’s Labyrinth,” the “Hellboy” series and “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark.” There’s hideous creatures, lots of blood splatter and poison tea. When opportunity knocks for snide, campy fun, del Toro bites. As does his game cast of Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska, Charlie Hunnam and Jessica Chastain, whose macabre machinations flat-out steal the movie. She’s del Toro’s best asset. The movie starts out in prologue with the funeral for the mother of Edith Cushing (Wasikowska). In voiceover, Edith warns “ghosts are real.” Later, the specter of her dead mother visits and warns “beware of the crimson peak.” Next, it’s turn-of-the-century Buffalo, N.Y. Edith lives with her protective and well-off father, Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). A sought-after beauty, Edith is more interested in writing ghost novels than landing a husband, much to the disappointment of local physician Dr. Alan McMichael (Hunnam). Blowing into town one day to peddle some sort of construction contraption are the dashing and mysterious Sharpe siblings – Thomas (Hiddleston) and Lucille (Chastain). Thomas sweeps Edith off her feet and whisks her off to England to live in his family’s Allerdale Hall, a frightening Victorian (naturally) mansion also inhabited by Lucille. That’s where the duplicitous motives of the siblings – the most shuddersome brother and sister seen on screen in a while – begin to show. Edith has always had a thing for apparitions, but this dark-and-dreary mansion with the hole in the roof and sagging, rotting floorboards is ripe with ghosts and other horrors. Any bride in her right mind would flee and not look back. But not the smitten Edith. Stylish and eerily compelling before it overplays its hand, the movie gets a huge boost from the performances. Chastain is a pro at doing aloof mixed with shades of crazy. She’s a woman used to wielding a cleaver. Her every word and action has double meaning. Chastain and Wasikowska square off in a climatic showdown that will surely earn them a Best Fight nomination at the MTV Movie Awards. Page 2 of 2 - Del Toro, working from a screenplay he co-wrote with frequent collaborator Matthew Robbins, plays joyfully with color, namely the bold reds of the film’s title. Sir Thomas harvests red clay and stores the soupy, blood-like substance in vats in the basement. Edith’s wedding ring is a deep ruby. When we first see Lucille, she’s wearing a sanguin-hued gown. And of course, there’s blood, lots of which will be spilled by the time Edith uncovers all the Sharpe family secrets.
