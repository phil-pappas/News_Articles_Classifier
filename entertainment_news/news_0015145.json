We’ve enjoyed dinner there in the past, and breakfast was equally wonderful. We were quickly seated in the charming front porch dining room at a rough-hewn table near the wall of windows overlooking a lovely garden. Soon we were sipping locally roasted Bean Stock Coffee ($2.25 each) and looking over the menu. The offerings included several eggs Benedict options, a large number of specialty omelets, pancakes and a Belgium waffle. The waffle ($7 with $1.75 upgrade for real maple syrup) seemed like the perfect item to order for Isabelle – especially since she’s not quite 2 so there would be plenty left for us to sample. The waffle was crisp on the outside and soft on the interior. It was delicious. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros ($10). The dish included a plate-sized flour tortilla, with three perfectly poached eggs (his request), avocado, tomato pico and some nicely seasoned black beans. He broke off pieces of the tortilla and made little sandwiches with all the ingredients. The breakfast I ordered was equally interactive. The smoked salmon bagel plate ($12) came with a toasted bagel, cream cheese, capers, sliced red onions, three large tomato slices and enough smoked salmon that I brought home the leftovers. Like my husband, I made little sandwich bites. The only complaint was that I ordered an everything bagel and got a plain one. We both ordered sides with mixed results. My husband’s side of corned beef hash ($4) was canned rather than homemade. It was nicely crisped up, but the quality was just average. My side order of home fries ($2.25) was also perfectly crisped and had a nice undertone of what tasted like thyme. Even though we dined with a very young child, we felt very welcome at The Wicked Oyster. Service was attentive and friendly. Our food was also delivered in a timely manner and it was obvious it had not sat under a heat lamp for any length of time. Now that we’ve had dinner and breakfast at The Wicked Oyster, the only meal we still need to sample is lunch. They just started serving lunch every day for the off season, and we can’t wait to give it a try.
