Tune in to @ESPN ’s Monday Night Football for a new look at #TheForceAwakens . pic.twitter.com/NTRWLlVyID\n— Star Wars (@starwars) October 18, 2015 Lucasfilm, acquired by Disney in 2012 for $4 billion, has kept a tight lid on the new film's plot, making Monday's trailer the largest look at the movie to date.\nThe company released the first 90-second teaser in November 2014, following up with another 90-second teaser in April, a three-and-a-half minute behind-the-scenes video at San Diego Comic Con in July and a brief Instagram teaser in August — leaving fans jonesing for story details and images from the new film.\nBut, the minimal teases have gone pretty far in terms of building hype: the second trailer alone has garnered more than 63 million views on YouTube since its release.\nRELATED: Princess Leia bikini from 'Star Wars' fetches nearly $100,000 at auction\n\"The Force Awakens\" signifies a number of \"firsts\" for the film series: it's the first \"Star Wars\" film since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012; the first since 2005's \"Revenge of the Sith,\" the conclusion to a divisive set of prequel films; and, perhaps most importantly, the first to be made without series creator George Lucas in a major production role.\nLucasfilm, now under the stewardship of film producer Kathleen Kennedy, seemingly aped the franchise model employed by fellow Disney property Marvel, opening the faucet for a new \"Star Wars\" trilogy to be concluded in 2019 along with a series of stand-alone films exploring stories within the universe but outside of the main chronology.\nRELATED: Giant California $14.9 million mansion with a Star Wars-themed bedroom\nThe new film combines new cast members — including Boyega, Driver, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Gwendoline Christie and Lupita Nyong'o among others — with returning actors from the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, including Hamill, Ford and Carrie Fisher.\nDirector J.J. Abrams — who previously helmed the 2009 film \"Star Trek\" and its 2013 sequel \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" — co-wrote the screenplay with Lawrence Kasdan, who helped pen \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi.\"\nComposer John Williams will also return to orchestrate the series' iconic musical score.\nRELATED: Photographer snaps photo of 'Han Cholo,' 'Loca Leia' in 'Star Wars' cosplay at Long Beach Comic Con\nBox office predictions vary for \"The Force Awakens,\" with many speculating that it could challenge James Cameron's 2009 film \"Avatar\" for the title of highest-grossing film of all time without adjusting for inflation.\nThat film made more than $2.7 billion worldwide by the end of its theatrical run, according to Box Office Mojo .\nA \"realistic\" prediction from Forbes predicts the new film will likely make between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion worldwide.\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" will open for U.S. audiences on Dec. 18, though screenings of the film are expected to begin the evening of Dec. 17.\nScroll through the above slideshow to test your \"Star Wars\" knowledge and treat yourself with the latest images from the
