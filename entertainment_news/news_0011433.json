Jorma Kaukonen promises a plucky performance in Pittsburgh Barry Berenson \nJorma Kaukonen will perform Sunday at Carnegie Lecture Hall. \nPITTSBURGH -- It's been a good year for Jorma Kaukonen, a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer with Jefferson Airplane, which he co-founded half a century ago. \nKaukonen's latest solo album, \"Ain't No Hurry,\" has earned strong reviews, while a documentary was released, \"Fur Peach Ranch: It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,\" profiling his southeast Ohio guitar camp. \nKaukonen is back on the road, with his solo acoustic tour making a Sunday stop at the Carnegie Lecture Hall in Pittsburgh's Oakland section. \n\"If you're a fan of plucked, fretted instruments, that'll be the place to be,\" Kaukonen said in a phone interview from Seattle. \"It's a fun show, and I'll be gabbing about some stuff. It's a real retrospective.\" \nHe's excited that fellow acoustic bluesman Ernie Hawkins, a Pittsburgh native, also will perform as part of the concert sponsored by Calliope, western Pennsylvania's folk music society. \n\"He's a dear friend and a noble musician,\" Kaukonen said. \nKaukonen is supporting that new album \"Ainâ€™t In No Hurry,\" a collection of originals and some classic American songs, such as the Depression-era \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" \nOne new composition, \"Suffer Little Children to Come Unto Me,\" features a melody crafted by Kaukonen and Bob Dylan sideman Larry Campbell for lost lyrics written by Woody Guthrie that were presented to them by Guthrie's daughter, Nora. Kaukonen loved the line about \"Going to college, and buying a degree.\" \nKaukonen said his setlist will include songs by blues-rockers Hot Tuna, his Jefferson Airplane spinoff group with bassist Jack Casady. \nJefferson Airplane-wise, Kaukonen usually performs \"Good Shepherd,\" his standout psychedelic-folk song from the Woodstock band's 1969 album, \"Volunteers.\" \nKaukonen associates one of Jefferson Airplane/Hot Tuna bandmates, the late-Papa John Creach, with Beaver County. \n\"Papa John always spoke fondly of Beaver Falls. That was his hometown,\" Kaukonen said of Creach, an electric violinist who called Beaver Falls home from his birth in 1917 until 1935, when his family moved to Chicago. \nThough that was a racially divided era, Creach, of African-American descent, \"never talked about that,\" Kaukonen said. \"He was the most pleasant, upbeat guy.\" \nAfter the Pittsburgh show, Kaukonen has an 11-day break from touring, giving him time to check in on his Pomeroy, Ohio, guitar camp and the adjacent Psylodelic, an art gallery devoted to 1960s culture operated by his wife in a two-story farm silo. \n\"Touring is still my bread-and-butter, though,\" said the man who gigs 150 to 200 nights a year. \nThere's always a new adventure on the horizon, such as in 2009, when the Coen Brothers' dark comedy \"A Serious Man\" prominently featured Jefferson Airplane's \"Somebody to Love,\" including a scene where a rabbi returns a Hebrew student's confiscated tape device with that song. The rabbi recites the band members' names, comically going slowly while awkwardly reciting each syllable in Kaukonen's unusual name. \n\"That was hilarious,\" Kaukonen said. \"We were all thrilled.\" If You Go \nWhat: Jorma Kaukonen in concert \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Sunday \nWhere: Carnegie Lecture Hall, Pittsburgh's Oakland section \nTickets: $44 standard admission; $23 for full-time students with ID; $106 VIP includes best seats and post-concert reception at The Porch at Schenley Plaza with food, drinks and live music \nInformation: calliopehouse.org or 412-361-1915", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:19:34.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
