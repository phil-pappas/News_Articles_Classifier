City’s Locked Away featuring Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine. Rudimental (Ian West/PA) \nMeanwhile, Brit-winning Hackney four-piece Rudimental are on course to achieve their second chart-topping album with their new record, We The Generation. \nAmir Amor, Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and DJ Locksmith previously topped the UK album charts in May 2013 with their debut album, Home. Tom Smith and Russell Leetch of The Editors (Ian West/PA) \nRudimental face competition from Stafford rockers Editors, whose latest album In Dream is tipped to take second place when this week’s charts are revealed on Friday.
