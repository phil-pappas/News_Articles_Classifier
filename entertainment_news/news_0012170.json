Dodgem cars are the best value rides at the show because they fit two people. Picture: SCOTT FLETCHER Source: News Corp Australia \nShowmans’ Guild of Australia Tasmanian secretary Di Alexander said all rides were priced between $5 and $10. \nShe said the best value were the dodgem cars, because an adult and child could ride for only $6 or $7. \n“They’re always the best value because you can fit two people in them,” she said. \nShowgoers can also get two-for-one-deals on the rides by collecting coupons in the Mercury newspaper. There will be two pages of coupons in Tuesday’s Mercury , all valid for the Saturday show. As well as rides, the coupons offer discounts on food and sideshow games. How to do the Show on a budget \nEntertainment \nOnce showgoers have paid for entry, all entertainment is free. \nHighlights this year include: \n• The BMX Bandit — Scott Hone. The BMX stunt artist, who has travelled the world with Circus Oz, makes skids and wheelies look like ballet with a bike. \n• The Rooftop Express — Queensland cattlemen with highly trained horses and farm animals performing stunts on the ground and on the top of the Rooftop Express bus. \n• Zap Circus — an internationally acclaimed acrobatics and fire show, fresh from their tour of the US. Lots of fire, laughs and acrobatics. \nRides \nAll rides are priced between $5 and $10, with the little kids’ rides at $5. This year, for the first time in many years, a trad­itional carousel will be at the show, costing $6 a ticket. \nThe teenage and adult rides cost between $8 and $10, with this year’s popular ones including the Alpine Express, Energy Storm, Lethal Weapon and the Hurricane. \nDodgem cars will fit two people in a car for $6 or $7.

There will be a variety of animals and their mothers, including sows and piglets, cows and calves, ducklings, chickens, guinea pigs, reptiles and a couple of baby Tasmanian devils. \n• Patting pen — hands-on section of the nursery where children can cuddle and pat the animals. \n• Reptile Rescue — an array of snakes and lizards. \n• Animal judging — nearly 700 dogs will vie for the Best Dog at the Show title. Other judging includes cats, sheep, poultry and cattle. \nFarm life • Beekeeping — an on-site beehive where people can learn about the role of the queen bee and see how honey is made. \n• Butter making — the trad­itional method before mach­ines were invented. \n• A Life on the Farm display will hold demonstrations of cow milking, sheep shearing and spud digging. \n• Pigs will be auctioned and raced. \nBrian Fish, of Oatlands, with his Bullock team.
