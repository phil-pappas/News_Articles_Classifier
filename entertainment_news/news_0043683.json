They didn’t mention Bond then – we talked about the film and their experience of Mandela.” The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Chris Jackson/PA) \nThe 24th James Bond film, directed by Skyfall’s Sam Mendes, will be graced by the royals after it was selected for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund’s Royal Film Performance 2015. \nSpectre, the 24th instalment in the 007 franchise, is the third Bond film chosen for the Royal Film Performance since its inception in 1946, following previous premieres for Die Another Day (2002) and Skyfall (2012).
