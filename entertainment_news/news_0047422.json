For the past year, customers have requested that McDonald's have an all-day breakfast menu. Now after more than 120,000 requests, McDonald's is moving ahead with the plan, according to USA Today on Saturday.\nPhoto by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Beginning Tuesday, Oct. 6, McDonald’s restaurants will serve McDonald’s breakfast all day. The menu includes Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin, platters, hash browns, burritos and oatmeal. Even though breakfast will be served all day at McDonald's, some items might not be available in every McDonald's across the nation, according to E! Online . It depends on the area where the McDonald's is located. Some McDonald's restaurants will have a limited menu of either Egg McMuffins or biscuits items, but not both. Pancakes, sausage burritos, yogurt, and oatmeal will be on most menus, but don't expect McGriddles and bagels or the Big Breakfast after 10:30 a.m. Hash browns may or may not be available all day long.\nFox News reported that serving breakfast all day long is a move by McDonald's trying to boost sagging sales and to keep up with competitors who also serve breakfast throughout the day. The restaurant chain began testing all day breakfasts in some localities back in March. Now McDonald's is ready to expand across the nation. Consumers no longer will have to race to beat the morning clock at McDonald's to grab a breakfast item.\nMcDonald's is the world's largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants, serving around 68 million customers daily in 119 countries across 35,000 outlets. McDonald's is known for selling hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/10/02/all-day-breakfast-mcdonalds-starts-monday/73219392/", "http://www.eonline.com/news/694482/mcdonald-s-all-day-breakfast-menu-has-a-pretty-big-catch", "http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/30187454/mcdonalds-all-day-breakfast-begins-tuesday"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:12:43.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
