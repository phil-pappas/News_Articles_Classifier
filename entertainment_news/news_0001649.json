He has stayed firmly rooted and neither has the former lecturer's love of literature diminished nor his determination to be a self-sufficient farmer. The actor speaks about his interests and upcoming Kannada and Tamil films.\nFARMING, TEACHING OR ACTING... WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE? I love all three. If I have to choose just one of them, I will pick farming. My belief is that it is the only productive human work. We grow from the soil, eat its products, excrete, recycle and, finally, when we die, we become part of it. The city, its drainage system and everything else distances us from this recycling process of life. Farming is the only natural thing we can do. I do not know how productive films are in that sense. There are films that have a message and spread values. That is the contribution of films.\nSO ARE BRIDGE AND ART FILMS BETTER THAN COMMERCIAL FILMS?\nAn ad filmmaker friend of mine says that people have become accustomed to think `popular.' The thinking of people today is towards seeing watching and understanding only popular things. Any serious issue, too, needs to be told in a popular method. Only then will it reach the people. A popular medium or popular format in films is indispensable.Vasodagama is a film in this popular format of commercial films. It is a typical mass movie and, without using this format which includes comedy, fights etc., it would be impossible to get across what we are trying to say. Nobody would watch a lecture on education. It would be easy to term commercial films braindead but commercial cinema's main job is to entertain.\nIS A SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM OFFERED IN VASCODAGAMA?\nA film need not find a solution to problems. In the film, the protagonist finds his own way of doing things. It is not the solution, but a way out for him. No film maker trie to provide solutions to problems. A film is his perspective of the issue.His job is done if the manages to make people aware of the issue and talk about it. Bringing any issue or problem to the fore is an achievement for a filmmaker. Finally, it is the maker's viewpoint that is in the film and, more often than not, it is the viewpoint of the majority of the people.\nYOU HAVE BEEN A LECTURER.WHAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM YOU FIND IN EDUCATION?\nThe whole idea of education has become a process of creating a workforce. I took an advertising course. I don't know how much I understood. One of the ideas of marketing was this; first, create a need, then create a want for it. Education has also become a tool in this capitalist empire-building process. A capitalist needs to build an empire. He needs customers. He needs people trained to work for him. Take the information technology industry. Almost everyone in the last generation started training or ` got educated' to become a techie. The companies are established by the capitalist as well as the colleges that train the workforce for them. I did not believe that such things are a reality. It turns out education is just like our saas-bahu serials. It is manipulation of the masses. When even wars are manipulated, this does not seem farfetched. Education has become a training ground for us to work for somebody.\nWHY ARE FARMERS COMMITTING SUICIDE?\nFarmers ideally should not have any obligation. But, in a money-centric economy, we have made them dependent on money. Farmer is the only real producer, but we have made him into a buyer. Farmers were self-sufficient and, with their traditional knowledge, managed their lives without the need to buy anything from others.They are doing the biggest job in the world, that of providing us food.\nNo farmer was dying for lack of food. He is dying today for lack of money. A city-specific economy dictates what he has to buy, something he did not need earlier. All the money is in the cities. So, instead of producing what he wanted, he has to grow what the city demands. In a recent seminar, I was told I should grow something that is in demand in Mumbai as it pays well. That is what farmers are being pushed into.They are forced to grow things that are unnatural and unsuitable to the local situations. So, they end up growing lettuce and wheat here.The green revolution, the government policies and the city-centric economy are to blame for the suicides of farmers.\nPrakash Rai was trying to buy back some lands around a wildlife bottleneck and help create a wildlife corridor. A few tribals had to be resettled. A hotel group approached him and said they would help in resettling the tribals. When asked how, they said they would train them, teach them etiquette and make them stewards and servers in their hotel! Prakash threw them out saying they were trying to make bonded labourers out of free men. We are trying to push farmers into our so-called sophistication and ruining them.\nYOUR LATEST TAMIL FILM IS WITH KAMAL HAASAN...\nMore than working with him, it was the biggest opportunity to see him and his work up-close. I am a big fan of his and it was a festive occasion for me. It is nice to see him work. He loves films so much.Watching him, I forgot to even take a photo with him.\nHOW ARE YOU FILMS SHAPING UP?\nApart from Vascodagama, which is releasing now, I have completed Octopus, Tundaikla Sahavasa and Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu in Kannada.In Tamil, I recently completed shooting for Thoonga Vanam starring Kamal Haasan. It is a Deepavali release. Vadagai Veedu and Kalathur Gramam are the other films. There are many new directors who are coming with new kinds of films. An actor like me, who does not have a typical film face, is the biggest beneficiary.\nHOW GLAMOROUS IS THE GLAMOUR WORLD? YOUR FIRST DIRECTOR BHARAT IS JUST STARTING OUT ON HIS SECOND FILM WHILE YOU HAVE COMPLETED 50 FILMS AS AN ACTOR...\nIn any field, understanding the problems from outside is not possible. It is only when you are inside that you realise the difficulties involved. Direction takes a longer time. It takes away one or two years of a director's life. An actor, on the other hand, can jump from one project to another. I am happy for Bharat. He had earlier worked for Ravichandran, and launching his son would be a big achievement.\nDO YOU HAVE PLANS TO MOVE TO OTHER ASPECTS OF FILMMAKING?\nMany directors today are open about their projects. So, sometimes, I get a chance to be with them during the scripting process. It is a very good experience to go through the story-making process. It makes things easy for me. I never prepare for a role. I am lazy on that front.Another reason is that the director would have a vision for every role and, if I prepare on my own, it interferes with the director's work.\nANY PLANS TO GO BACK TO THEATRE?\nDuring the shooting of Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu, director Sumana Kittur suggested we do a play. It is not easy in between all the films we do. But I have the urge to go back to stage. We are planning to stage a play next year. The practice takes a lot of time. The plan is the have multiple shows of the same play so that less time goes into the practice. Even Kittur is busy with post-production of the film, and the play may happen sometime next year.\nDO YOU STILL GET TIME TO\nThere is so much time for reading during shooting. I carry books with my luggage.\nHAS YOUR ORGANIC FARM BECOME PROFITABLE?\nI don't know if it has in terms of money but, in terms of the soil fertility and establishing a balance, we are close to it. Last year, a cobra bit a person on the a farm. It is a good sign that snakes are coming back and feeling at home. Many birds have started nesting. Someone suggested that we should use a certain poison to kill all snakes. That is not what organic farming is about. All animals should feel at home. The fertility is very good now and that is the profit. Within two years, we will stop ploughing completely. The only interference will be seeding.\nFAVOURITE WRITERS\nPoornachandra Tejaswi is my all-time favourite. I suggest him to everyone.Even if you are just starting out, he is the perfect writer to start with. His writing is so simple, yet with so much depth. He is entertaining as well as stimulating. It is like our bridge films.Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu is based on his work and Kittur has done a good job in the challenging task of bringing his writing into the visual format. Another writer I admire is Krishna Alanahalli. Works of Kuvempu are my favourite. I recently heard an audio book of Vasudhendra. He is one of the best in the new generation of Kannada writers. I also love works of DR Nagaraj. Reading his works makes you analytical. I like reading all of Chandrashekara Kambar's works, inlcuding his poems and plays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:58:56.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
