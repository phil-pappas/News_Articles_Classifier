Rough cut (no reporter narration)   \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman, known for \"The Shawshank Redemption\", \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Batman Begins\", arrived at the Giza Pyramids on Friday (October 23) to shoot his documentary \"The Story of God\". Freeman is an executive producer of the feature along with Lori McCreary and James Younger of Revelations Entertainment and National Geographic Channel. They announced in June that it would be a new global series exploring mankind's quest to understand the divine. Freeman, who is also presenting the documentary, is said to be embarking on an exploration and reflection of God, immersing himself in religious experiences and rituals all around the world, as well as becoming a test subject in scientific labs to examine how the frontiers of neuroscience and cosmology intersect with the traditional domain of religion. The crew's presence in Egypt caused a stir during the week when the country's censorship authority reportedly questioned Freeman's activities, said state-owned media Al Ahram, adding that no filming permits were applied for. State Information Services, however, declared that the crew have been cleared for filming. In addition to Egypt, Freeman will be filming in Jerusalem and India. \"The Story of God\" is expected to air on National Geographic Channel and Nat Geo Mundo in 2016 in the U.S. and globally in 171 countries and 45 languages.  //reut.rs/1MJ9O6R", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:31.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
