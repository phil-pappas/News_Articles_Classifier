Surely if someone really wants you dead that badly, they’ll find a way? Is it worth a blanket ban for the sake of a few ‘might happen’ or ‘could occur’ scenarios? \nIt’s times like this the notion of religion really grates on me. Churches and religious groups come forward to campaign against the law, seeking to force their own beliefs and ideals on others, wishing to deny people free will in the name of their imaginary deity. Seeking to take away the very choice in the first place. \nHow could you look a dying person in the face when they’re ravaged by illness, reliant upon high- strength medication to make it through a few hours of sub-standard life, and tell them that the choice cannot be theirs? \nOf course every case needs to be considered individually, but on the whole it’s inhumane – we don’t do it to pets, so why allow people to go through this when they simply can no longer take it? \nAnd what God, should he exist, would turn a man away at the pearly gates? Banishing them to hell after a righteous life, simply because they didn’t wish to live through the agony of a few more weeks? Who is this awfully cruel, heinous God? Nonsense. \nThat said, in other news this week, the UK was ranked the best place in the world to die. Well, our end-of-life care has been ranked as the best according to a new study, anyway. (Obviously it’d be much nicer to die overlooking a stunning mountainscape than a snatched window view of Spaghetti Junction . . .) \nThe ranking was worked out following assessments for the quality of our hospitals and hospices, staff numbers and their skills and the affordability and quality of care. They looked at the end-of-life care in 80 countries and found, thanks to the NHS and hospice movement, our care was ‘second to none’. \nIt offers only a little bit of comfort, really. It’s nice to know if I’m struck by an incurable disease that would leave me in agony until I died, there would be enough skilled medical professionals on standby to inject the morphine. And it wouldn’t leave my kids in debt. \nI have no doubt the palliative care offered by the staff in our hospitals and hospices is excellent. I hope I’m lucky enough not to have to experience it. I’d just want to check out sharpish, before the illness made it so that the decision was no longer mine. \nOn the website of my local vets, they discuss euthanasia. “Help your beloved pet to slip away peacefully, with dignity and without further suffering,” it says. The practice also offers aftercare for the family to deal with the sadness and difficulties faced following such a heartbreaking loss. \nAnd it’s highly likely your pet (unless they’re some super-smart animal the likes of which science itself would hold aloft and claim ‘MIRACLE!’) doesn’t know the pain they’re set to face if they continue to live when they’re desperately unwell. \nSo why do we not have a say, knowing what we know? Not only do we have to put up with the agony that comes with terminal illness, but we also have to put up with the psychological torment of knowing we were coasting a horrible journey until our deaths. And we have the added torment of being aware of how this is making our loved ones feel too. \nTo compromise with those lawmakers who were worried about unintended consequences (such as the targeting of the poor, elderly and disabled), the Californian law will expire in 10 years unless extended. Hopefully in that decade, California will see what a great decision it was and extend it further, with other states following its lead. \nAnd hopefully, in 10 years, we’ll be making such good decisions here too. \nBy Kirsty Bosley Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
