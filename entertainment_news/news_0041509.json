In the movie, which predicts the events of 2015, the Cubs win the World Series.\n\"What better way to give him the idea than with a really outrageous scenario, which is, the Cubs win the World Series?\" Gale told ESPN earlier this month . \"It's a double joke because they win the World Series against Miami -- which (didn't have) major league baseball in 1989. ... The second prediction, people don't automatically realize when they watch the movie today, but we were predicting there would be a major league team in Miami.\"\nThe Cubs defeated the Cardinals this month to advance to the National League Championship Series, where they have been facing the New York Mets. Gale told ESPN he had mixed emotions about the Cubs-Cardinals series.\n\"Somebody once defined mixed emotions as watching your mother-in-law drive off a cliff in your brand-new Mercedes,\" Gale joked. \"Was I rooting for the Cardinals? Yes. Was I also rooting for the Cubs? Yeah, maybe a little bit. This is one of those things where whatever happens, I'm a winner. If the Cardinals win, I'm happy about that. ... But if the Cubs win, then I look really smart.\"\nThe Cubs play the Mets in Game 4 of the seven-game series at Wrigley Field Wednesday, which happens to be the date to which Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) travels in time in \"Back to the Future Part II.\" The Mets lead the series 3-0 and if they win Wednesday, they go on to the World Series.\nIt's time for 'Back to the Future' Day Derrik J.
