Photo: Heoinn Eiriksson \nMELBOURNE FESTIVAL\nKIASMOS ★★★ \nFestival Hub, October 9 \nWe were 35 minutes into the warm-up set when a fade to the \"stage changeover\" playlist cued up the ugly lights. Muzak and confusion. Were we in the right place?\nThe gorgeous strings of Lit answered the question, heralding the arrival of Olafur Arnalds and Janus Rasmussen. The ugly lights were switched off. It was time to get to work.\nThe duo were silhouetted, bopping. A cloudscape swayed behind them like the crowd in front. The kick drum kicked in. The crowd heaved and hollered. I think they knew this one.\nAdvertisement Strings soared as the bassline rumbled. Kiasmos were being flashed by floor lights, pumping their fists. Mumbling into a microphone, as if to complete the cliche.\nIt felt very much like Friday night at a festival. Stereosonic screams from a crowd that was anything but. Future Music fist-pumping on the stage.\nThe rapturous – and well-recognised – material from Kiasmos' lauded self-titled album gave way to the grittier Wrecked . The rolling snare and industrial bassline pegged the euphoria back a notch, quickly remedied by the bubbly Swayed .\nThe sublime Thrown further lifted the crowd. Eyes closed, entranced, beholden to Olafur's tweaks of his iPad controller – he had us in the palm of his hand.\nThen it was goodnight from the duo, but the crowd was well-trained in the encore charade. Nobody moved, and after two minutes of polite consternation, Kiasmos was back.\n\"Let's dance now,\" commanded Janus, on the microphone again, and he meant it. It was time to get Bent .\nIt wasn't the most euphoric, the most bass-heavy, the most Olafur, or the most Janus tune that Kiasmos played, but it was the most well-known. And on this festival dancefloor, that's all that mattered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:51:33.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
