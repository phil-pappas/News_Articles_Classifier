Harvest Buchanan Festival starts Friday evening By Landa Bagley South Bend Tribune SouthBendTribune.com \nBUCHANAN — Being bored is not likely to be an option in Buchanan this weekend. \nChock full of things to see and do, Harvest Buchanan Festival is set for Friday evening and all day Saturday. \nOn Saturday, the festival will feature a farmers' market, pancake breakfast, classic car cruise-in, live music, a pumpkin jamboree with hayrides, and free Zumba lessons. The headlining music act will be 5th Gear, performing at the Common, 122 Days Ave. All or most of the other festival activities will occur at or near the Common. \nAdmission is free for the festival, although there are fees for a few festival events. Food and beverages, including wine and beer from local breweries, will be sold by vendors during the event. Free parking will be available at Front and Main streets. \n“It’s an inexpensive, fun, family-friendly way to spend harvest-time in Buchanan,” said Randy Hendrixson, executive director of the Buchanan Chamber of Commerce. The chamber partnered with the city of Buchanan to put on this festival. \n“It’s a popular event,” Hendrixson added. “To give you an idea, we usually have several hundred people come to our farmers' market and about 1,000 people alone for the headlining act.” \nHarvest Buchanan actually kicks off Friday, with a homecoming parade at 5:30 p.m. that ends at Buchanan High School, which has its homecoming football game that night. \nMaking its debut at the festival is the Children’s Pedal Tractor Pull Contest. Pedal tractors will be provided for the contestants. Registration is between 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m. Saturday outside of the Buchanan District Library. The event runs from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. \nThe Pumpkin Jamboree, being put on by the Buchanan District Library, will offer children’s games, prizes, crafts, a cupcake walk, a hayride, and a petting zoo. The jamboree runs from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. around the outside of the library building. \nHarvest Buchanan also includes community events that might otherwise occur on separate days, such as a benefit breakfast with a motorcycle ride to raise funds for a boy fighting leukemia, and the third-annual McCoy’s Creek Trail 5k run/walk. \nFire & Iron Station 140 motorcycle club is putting on the pancake breakfast and bike ride to raise money to help offset the medical costs for Gannon Kutemeier, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in January. Registration at the event starts at 8:30 a.m., with the first bike leaving at 11 a.m. The cost is $15 per single rider, and $20 per couple. A pancake breakfast is included with the cost for the riders. \nEntry fees for the 5k runners and walkers includes the pancake breakfast, while the donations are being sought from the general public at the breakfast. Call 269-362-1967 for more details about the 5k event and registering for it. \nFor more information about the Harvest Buchanan Festival and other community events combined with the festival, visit www.buchanan.mi.us and click on the “Harvest Buchanan.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:06:53.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
