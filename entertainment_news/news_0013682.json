That includes the South Carolina band Islander, opening for Korn on their latest tour (along with Suicide Silence). With the release of its self-titled debut album in 1994, Korn gave mainstream heavy metal a jolt, providing a fresh new direction for a genre that had become eclipsed by grunge and alternative rock. Singer Jonathan Davis had the vulnerability and personal lyricism of grunge artists, while his bandmates played dark, heavy music influenced by thrash and hip-hop in equal measure. \nSince then, Korn has kept evolving while retaining the core sound, even flirting with dubstep on 2011’s The Path of Totality. The band’s most recent album, 2013’s The Paradigm Shift, marked the return of original guitarist Brian “Head” Welch, with a back-to-basics approach focused on melody and aggression. In concert, the band draws from its deep catalog, proving that both the old and the “nu” can remain fresh and vital. \nHouse of Blues at Mandalay Bay, 6:30 p.m. Oct. 23, starting at $49.50 plus tax and fee, 18+. 800.745.3000 Ticketmaster More to Read", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:15:37.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
