They‚Äôll need to power up their laptops, iPads or desktop computers because the game will not be televised locally. It will be streamed live over Yahoo.com. The NFL is only allowing the game to be shown by CBS in Buffalo and Jacksonville, which are considered ‚Äúprimary‚Äù markets. Everywhere else in the world the game will be available only via Yahoo!. Even ‚ÄúNFL Ticket‚Äù subscribers on DirecTV will be shut out.\nThe deal between Yahoo! and the NFL was announced in June. They‚Äôre promoting it as the first free, live global webcast of a regular-season NFL game.\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nMaiorana: Rex is overthinking Bills' defensive plan\nThe Bills have arrived in London. #UKBills üá¨üáß pic.twitter.com/08dHFzIB8t\n‚Äî Buffalo Bills (@buffalobills) October 19, 2015 But the game not being televised locally is sure to irk many fans.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already taken calls from frustrated viewers about this who come to expect the majority of Bills games to be on our air,‚Äù John Kucko, the sports director at Rochester‚Äôs CBS affiliate WROC-TV, said Monday from London. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only my guess, but I think it‚Äôs obviously important for the NFL to see how this web-streaming goes.‚Äù\nEssentially, the NFL is using the Bills (3-3) and Jaguars (1-5) in an experiment to gauge its digital audience for the game. It‚Äôll be the only one on this Sunday at 9:30 a.m. ET, which is about 3¬Ω hours before the usual early games on the usual Sunday schedule.\n\"Lifelong Bills fans in Rochester getting the shaft again,\" said Duane Schepler, 60, of Hilton.\nSome Bills fans west of Rochester in Genesee County may still be able to watch the Bills' game on TV because they get Buffalo's CBS affiliate WIVB-TV as part of their cable television service, but that's not the case in Monroe and other surrounding counties such as Livingston, Wayne and Ontario. There are still several ways to still get the Yahoo! stream onto a television set.\nFans can connect HDMI cables from their computers to their TVs. Fans who own smart TVs can also watch the game via the Yahoo! app. There are also several devices, including Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV stick, Apple TV, Xbox 360 and Roku, that offer free apps that will allow you to view Yahoo!‚Äôs content on your TV.\nThat's how local restaurants and bars may still offer the game. At least one is advertising that it's opening early, so fans can have breakfast and watch the Bills. Of course, liquor laws do not allow the sale of alcohol prior to noon. The Retreat, 512 Long Pond Road in Greece, is offering a limited breakfast menu from 9 a.m. to noon.\nThe NFL didn't return an e-mail seeking comment for this story.\nSchepler is the audio visual manager at Finger Lakes Gaming and Racetrack in Farmington, Ontario County, and its \"Remedy Bar\" and \"Sevens Bar\" will carry the game via the stream, he said. But he's annoyed the NFL is doing this because he said most restaurants and bars aren't wired to stream video on their TVs.\nHe wasn't aware of the stream-only set up locally for this Bills' game until last week when he was alerted by a \"sports bar\" contact.\n\"Good enough to suck our ticket and merchandise dollars, hold pre-season camp (here at St. John Fisher College), keep us in the blackout market for 40 years,\" he said, \"but not good enough to have an away game on free broadcast TV or available on the DirecTV Sunday Ticket, which the public and supporting sports bars dump millions into each year just to make sure they get all the games.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nBills defense shredded in loss to Bengals\nBuy Photo Bills tight end Charles Clay looking for yards after a catch in Sunday's home loss to Cincinnati.

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nWhen the NFL used to black out games if a Bills game didn‚Äôt sell out ‚Äî a practice they ended before this season ‚Äî Rochester was part of the blackout. Last year, when a November snowstorm forced the Bills-Jets game to be moved from Orchard Park to Detroit, Rochester was one of the markets where the game was televised on a Monday night.\nBut Bills fans will have to watch a different way this Sunday.\n‚ÄúSomething like this reminds you that everyone isn‚Äôt wired,‚Äù with cable and Internet access, Kucko said. ‚ÄúYou just assume everyone has (that) and there are people out there who don‚Äôt.‚Äù\nIn a statement released earlier this year, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said this stream-only experiment is \"another important step in\" media innovation and that the league will \"closely monitor the rapidly evolving digital media landscape.\"\nThe fear for fans: The NFL will take games off free TV and charge for them online.\n\"We've known about this for months, but what a disservice,\" wrote 25-year-old Hilton resident Tyler Diedrich on Twitter. \"I for one hope this is a miserable failure for the @NFL .\"\nRichard Mallory, 72, a Bills fan from Webster said he's already questioning if he wants to keep watching the NFL because of this Yahoo deal.\n\"I could easily watch the game on my iPad or Smart TV but I'm not,\" he said via email. \"My way of a solitary protest against the NFL. It's all about the $$ to them.\"\nJDIVERON@DemocratandChronicle.com\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nRoth: Ryan's defense runs from fight in loss\nOpening early?\nIf you're a local restaurant or bar that's opening early Sunday specifically to show the Buffalo Bills' 9:30 a.m. game in London vs. Jacksonville via Yahoo!'s live stream, let us know by e-mailing reporter, Jeff DiVeronica at JDIVERON@Gannett.com .", "external_links": ["http://t.co/08dHFzIB8t", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0a423c0115d7c5f9f839f268bf8e03b47c183c7/c=474-0-4065-2700&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/19/Rochester/Rochester/635808611218452315-JG-101815-Bills-38.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/19/Rochester/Rochester/635808611218452315-JG-101815-Bills-38.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef657c72820f1ea6637499b25ddbc0de659b2a29/c=685-0-3606-2921/local/-/media/2015/10/19/Rochester/Rochester/635808641749193867-JG-101815-Bills-44.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/93a4ca056660fadebd47f6808822893ee5f1c14c/c=648-0-3324-2676/local/-/media/2015/10/18/Rochester/Rochester/635807893236983241-JG-101815-Bills-15.jpg", "https://twitter.com/buffalobills/status/656069969378222081", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKBills?src=hash", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e3c449b4de730cae32eafe6b5482d7f14962fe2/r=500x297/local/-/media/2015/10/19/Rochester/Rochester/635808611218452315-JG-101815-Bills-38.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa7c4c7f51eec145acd4d1759ab32cceae83cf99/c=568-0-2802-2234/local/-/media/2015/10/18/Rochester/Rochester/635807889109794329-JG-101815-Bills-1.JPG", "https://www.yahoo.com/", "https://twitter.com/NFL"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:12:02.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
