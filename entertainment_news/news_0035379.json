This Massachusetts man has a filthy mouth — and a dirty record.\nMichael (Mikey) Bergin, who became Internet famous for cursing in a thick Boston accent in a viral fishing video , has been arrested more than 20 times in the last 18 years, records show .\nHis arrests, which date to 1997, include charges of assault and battery, causing him to spend about 24 months in prison.\n\"What's prison like?\" Bergin told the Boston Herald. \"It became home to me. I'm not that person anymore.\"\nIn 2004, Bergin spent 18 months behind bars for throwing a phone at his then-girlfriend's 7-year-old niece after little MacKenzie Murtagh threatened to call the cops if Bergin continued to \"put his hands on my aunt and yell at her,\" records show.\n\"It makes me sick\" that Bergin has gotten famous and even appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, which made Murtaugh want to \"throw up,\" she said.\nBut Bergin, 41, and his girlfriend, Melanie Philbrook, continued to date until September 2010, when he threw her and her mother by their hair during a fight, records show. Bergin was \"going crazy,\" \"flipping out\" and \"foaming\" at the mouth without his medications, court records show.\nThe next day — after he was arrested — he kicked in his beau's door while trying to get his things, records show.\nFacebook A video of Boston native Michael Bergin yelling about a fish has gone viral. He spent six months in prison after pleading guilty to assault and battery charges.\nPhilbrook and her mom were granted permanent restraining orders against Bergin, who has since appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and started selling shirts off the \"seamonstah\" video. Three months after the restraining orders were granted, Bergin and a friend threatened the mother and daughter in two dozen phone calls, records show.\n\"My mother and I are quite disgusted that Mr. Bergin is getting all types of air time and financial endorsements and that there was no research done on his background prior to them airing and glorifying his verbiage — which was disgusting,\" Philbrook told the Herald.\nBut the Philbrook family wasn't the only one harmed by Bergin, records show.\nIn April 2011, Bergin threatened to blow up a woman's car after she asked him to leave her apartment, Boston.com reported. A year later, he spit on another girlfriend and warned her to \"start praying,\" records show.\nThe 41-year-old man from Malden, about 7 miles north of Boston, said he used to be addicted to opiates and has been clean for four years.\n\"My mouth has gotten me in trouble my whole life,\" Bergin said. \"If you add that mouth with the drug problem, you start scaring people.\"\nRelated Stories WATCH: Jimmy Kimmel interviews the ‘sea monstah’ guys Boston man loses it over ‘sea monstah’ in hilarious video", "external_links": ["http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/10/02/michael-bergin-the-sea-monstah-viral-star-has-violent-criminal-past/m4NYdAgJYOZUTFS6oAMLjP/story.html?p1=feature_pri_hp"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:07:07.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
