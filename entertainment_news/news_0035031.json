Rollo Ross reports.   \nIt's no joke that Sarah Silverman has left comedy behind with new movie 'I Smile Back'. In fact, she's even been critically acclaimed for her role as a housewife whose life is spiralling out of control through depressions, drugs, alcohol and illicit affairs. SOUNDBITE Actress, Sarah Silverman, saying (English): \"Comedians in general tend to come from a dark place. The reason that most comedians become funny is that survival skill, to be able to survive childhood, to be able to get through difficult times. I wasn't my best self all the time because I had all these emotions just kind of here. I felt like a toddler that didn't know what to do with their feelings sometimes but it was really exhilarating and it's something I'm so glad I didn't know it wouldn't be fun because I definitely would have tried to weasel out of it and I'm so glad I did it. It was an amazing experience for me.\" 'I Smile Back' is out in the US on October 23.  //reut.rs/1MF9XYS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:22:30.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
