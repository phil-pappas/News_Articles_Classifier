And her audience, typically of diners or hotel guests, was rarely attentive.\nSo, after hundreds of shows, around New Jersey and New York over seven years, Stanley employed a rather drastic change in 2013.\n\"I reached a point in my career, where I was either going to let it go, or I had to grow,\" she says in a recent interview.\nMORE: How local band Hodera's single caught fire on Spotify\nThe Basking Ridge native began to write original music for the first time in her life — not as some emotional teen, but in her twenties — and moved to California, in hopes of jumpstarting her singing and/or acting career.\nWhile the decision to leave New Jersey came with obvious risks, Stanley considered it a necessary shift.\n\"If we aren't doing what we love, we are depriving the world a little bit, of our own greatness,\" she says.\nAnd through that love, as well as Stanley's penchant for blending creamy pop and jazz, she released her debut LP, \"Hello California\" in August.\nShe's returned home for a few weeks, and in that time is playing a list of local shows, most notably an album release show at The Triad in New York Oct. 16.\nBrynn Stanley, a jazz-infused pop singer from Basking Ridge, released her debut album \"Hello California\" in August. (Courtesy of Brynn Stanley) WHAT SHE SOUNDS LIKE Those just catching on to Stanley might find her breezy, buoyant sound is a little mismatched for the increasingly cool weather. There's an inherently warm-weather aura surrounding an album titled \"Hello California,\" and its lead single \"Be My Summertime.\" But the whole LP isn't just surf and sunshine. Her motivational piano number \"Shine\" and the more somber, string-laden \"Black and White\" work in any season, and are anchored by her soft, round tone.\nStanley's years spent singing Nina Simone and Billie Holiday standards night after night have clearly augmented her vocal's polish and control, perhaps even to a fault. But few artists can pull off that manicured, timeless style and weave it into something contemporary. And \"Hello California\" does feel new — it's a smooth blend of pop, jazz and easy listening.\nWHO SHE SOUNDS LIKE Sara Bareilles, Colbie Caillat, Nicole Atkins\nWHY SHE MATTERS Stanley is worth a listen because she took a chance — a real chance. After years of singing in restaurants and hotels, essentially providing background noise for hours on end, she packed up and moved across the country, knowing a splash into California show biz is much less likely than a quick plunk and sink. But like her song \"Shine\" says, \"Kiss your fears goodbye, and take a chance in life.\"\nMost anyone with a decent singing voice or acting chops has imagined at least once the glamorous trip to Hollywood in pursuit of an even more glamorous career. Well, this is woman who is trying to make it happen, knowing the odds are against her.\n\"I don't want fame, but I want success,\" she says.\nNow, with her first crop of original tunes — good original tunes — she may have her best chance yet to make the risk she took two years ago worthwhile.\nWHERE YOU CAN SEE HER Saturday: The Washington House in Basking Ridge, 7 to 10 p.m.\nSunday: Shanghai Jazz in Madison, 6 to 8:30 p.m.\nTuesday: 16 Prospect in Westfield, 8 to 10 p.m.\nOct. 16: The Triad, New York (album release party), 9 to 10 p.m.\nOct. 17: Rod's Steakhouse in Florham Park, 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.\nBobby Olivier may be reached at bolivier@njadvancemedia.com.
