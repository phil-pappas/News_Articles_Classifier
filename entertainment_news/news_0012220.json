Many healthcare and life sciences business organizations are progressively seeking high end NLP technologies which would provide them better and quick access to the clinical data to derive better results for medical diagnosis. There is an explosive growth of unstructured clinical data, and healthcare firms are deploying solutions to utilize this unstructured data for many functions, such as to retrieve patient's history, to reduce the readmission of the patients for particular diseases, and to generate reminders for the physicians. \n\nThe type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for the healthcare and life sciences industry are broadly categorized into rule-based, statistical, and hybrid NLP solutions. The rule-based NLP technologies work on the basis of certain set of rules provided by humans. The statistical NLP solutions which incorporate high end technologies such as machine learning, use the cause and effect relationship to derive a solution, and the hybrid NLP is the combination of both rule-based and statistical NLP technologies. \n\nThe NLP market for healthcare and life sciences industry is also segmented on the basis of technologies, which include interactive voice response, optical character recognition, pattern and image recognition, auto coding, classification and categorization, text analytics, and speech analytics. However, the NLP market for the healthcare and life sciences industry is also segmented on the basis of deployment model into on premises and on demand deployment models for the NLP solutions. \n\nThis market research report consists of the detailed analysis, market sizing, and forecasting for the emerging submarkets of the NLP market for healthcare and life sciences industry. The report is segmented on the basis of type of NLP solutions, technologies, services, deployment models, and regions. The NLP market for healthcare and life sciences industry research report analyzes global adoption trends, future growth potential, key drivers, competitive outlook, restraints, opportunities, market ecosystem, and emerging technologies in this market. \n\nKey Topics Covered: \n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Research Methodology\n\n3 Executive Summary\n\n4 Premium Insights\n\n5 Market Overview\n\n6 Natural Language Processing Market For Healthcare And Life Sciences Industry, By Type\n\n7 Natural Language Processing Market For Healthcare And Life Sciences Industry, By Technology\n\n8 Natural Language Processing Market For Healthcare And Life Sciences Industry, By Service\n\n9 Natural Language Processing Market For Healthcare And Life Sciences Industry, By Deployment Model\n\n10 Natural Language Processing Market For Healthcare And Life Sciences Industry, Case Study\n\n11 Geographic Analysis\n\n12 Competitive Landscape\n\n13 Company Profiles\n\n- 3M \n- International Business Machines Corporation \n- Microsoft Corporation \n- Nuance Communication Inc. \n- Cerner Corporation \n- Optum, Inc. \n- Linguamatics \n- Health Fidelity \n- Apixio \n- Mmodal IP Llc \n- Dolbey Systems \n- Clinithink Inc. \n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/pvzb7x/natural_language \nMedia Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net \n\nSOURCE Research and Markets\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:37:48.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
