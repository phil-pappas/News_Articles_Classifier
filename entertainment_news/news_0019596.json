Other customs included leaving food out for family members who had passed on, and even performing rituals to aid in communicating with the dead. \nWhile I've never held a ghostly dinner party or ordered a spiritual pizza for the dead, Oct. 31 has always felt different to me, from the moment the sun appears in the morning, until the final stroke of midnight. \nI can remember sensing that feeling from the moment I opened my eyes on Halloween morning when I was a child.

Look it up. \nFinally, the dismissal bell would clang — seemingly louder and creepier on that day — and as soon as I climbed off the bus at home, mom and I would start setting up for the trick or treaters. \nThe house would already be decorated for the most part, but there were special items that only came out on Halloween night. \nThere were plastic molded pumpkin and scarecrow lights, the yearly jack-o-lantern, and — my favorite piece — a ghost made on a seamstress' dress form mannequin. \nMom would place one of my rubber kickballs on the mannequin's cardboard \"neck,\" slide a yardstick horizontally through the back of the form to simulate arms, then drape a white sheet over the round head to create a classic ghost. \nTwo black ovals cut from construction paper and taped on the face, and my dad's old work boots poking out from under the sheet, completed the piece de resistance. \nYou wouldn't believe how many kids would come in for their treat and stare at that contraption like it was going to move at any second. \nSome kids literally had to look under the sheet before they believed it was not a person waiting to pounce. \nThat is the kind of magic that Halloween produces. \nThousands of young imaginations — and older ones alike — firing simultaneously, plus the natural energy brought about by the equinox and impending solstice all fusing together is what brings Halloween to life all around us every chilly October. \nKelly Roncace is senior investigator and team leader with Jersey Unique Minds Paranormal Society , a professional paranormal investigation team based in Salem County.
