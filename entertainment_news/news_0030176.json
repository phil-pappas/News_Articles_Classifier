Photo: Kate Peters \nBritish Turner Prize-winning artist and cultural critic Grayson Perry has questioned whether Australian Aboriginal painting should be classified – or exhibited – as \"contemporary art\".\nPerry, a ceramicist and textile artist known also for his flamboyant cross-dressing and acerbic takedowns of pompous art criticism, described the placement of Indigenous art into the contemporary art canon as a cultural \"elephant in the room\".\nPerry is due to visit Australia in December for the opening of a major retrospective of his work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and to deliver a lecture on his art practice at the Opera House.\nGrayson Perry at the Victoria Miro Gallery, London. Photo: Kate Peters \nIn an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media, Perry said he had visited both the Royal Academy's 2013 survey exhibition of Australian art and this year's British Museum blockbuster Indigenous Australia and had seen some \"very beautiful and powerful objects\".\nAdvertisement However he said he could not agree with the classification of Indigenous art as \"contemporary … as if it were abstract expressionism\", defiantly admitting his comments were \"not very PC\".\n\"I say this as someone who is a contemporary artist and who sees a lot of people from all different areas – especially over the last 20 years – borrowing from the status of contemporary art. I write in my book [ Playing to the Gallery , Penguin 2014] – of the man who says, whenever he is putting up a shelf and it goes wrong 'it is my art project'.\n\"That is another version of the same thing ... use of the baggy bag of contemporary art as an excuse to get away with anything.\"\nPerry observed that Australia still seems to carry a great \"charge\" around the issue of colonialism: \"Probably more so than a lot of the other former colonies of Britain I imagine: the issues, the damage done, the legacy of it all,\" he said.\n\"…but when I see those Indigenous paintings crop up in contemporary art shows I go: 'Are they contemporary artists?'. The charge around the paintings is that they are paintings done by Aboriginal people with this huge, long tradition and that this is a continuation of it. And yet they are exhibited – and I'm not saying that is their [the artists'] intention – but they are exhibited in the contemporary art context as if they were abstract expressionism almost.\"\nAccording to ANU's Professor Howard Morphy, however, Perry's observations reflect \"a Eurocentric position on Aboriginal art which fails to take into account the incredible diversity of forms\".\nProfessor Morphy, one of the most distinguished international scholars and authors on Aboriginal art, questioned Perry's use of European analogies to describe Indigenous art.\n\"Why should we look at Aboriginal art as if it were abstract expressionism any more than we look at some Perry pots as if they were Chinese? It is fine to draw analogies if they are helpful to understand the formal and expressive properties of things or reflect particular influences, but not to create pigeon holes\" he said.\n\"[Perry] does not know the particular art history. Many Aboriginal artists are happy to be exhibited as contemporary artists working in continuing traditions – they do not wish to be exhibited as abstract expressionist or minimalists, or colour field painters or practitioners of geometric abstraction etc. This may be how people who do not know about their background and inspiration and place in art history position them.\" \nPerry said as a Western contemporary artist, he is \"constantly stealing things off indigenous cultures all over the place\".\n \"But I would never purport to be an African sculptor or a Chinese potter. I am Grayson Perry,\" he told Fairfax Media.\n\"I am interested in the tensions that swim around which, of course, go both ways. [While] I am constantly pinching off tribal and folk cultures from around the world, here is a much rarer case of an indigenous, tribal, folk culture borrowing the status of contemporary art.\"\nHowever Professor Morphy said Perry's arguments had been surpassed decades ago: \"In Australia that was part of the discourse in the 1970s when artists such as Imants Tillers and others felt threatened by the growing acceptance of Aboriginal art in the present. They  quickly changed their minds.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:14:56.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
