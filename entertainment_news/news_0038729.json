Related Items Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nJENNY McCarthy is heartbroken that Playboy has decided to stop featuring full-frontal nudity and says she \"would totally be willing\" to pose nude for the publication one last time. \nThe 42-year-old star, who rose to fame after first appearing in the magazine in 1993 and was later named Playmate of the Year, says she would \"totally be willing\" to pose nude for the publication one last time. \nThe blonde beauty said: \"I would totally be willing to just take it off one more time. Just to say 'I'll be in the last one.' It breaks my heart that it's the end of an era and in solidarity, I will be wearing my panties at half-mast.\" \nJenny is especially disappointed by boss Hugh Hefner's decision to stop publishing nude photographs from next March because she believes he \"worked hard on trying to find that Girl Next Door.\" \nSpeaking on her SiriusXM talk show, 'Dirty, Sexy Funny With Jenny McCarthy,' she explained: \"This is the thing I have a problem with. Playboy to me...is a classy magazine...a lot of people really do read it for the articles. \n\"When I did my test shoot there, I had one uni-brow and a giant bush to my knees. And they were like, 'You're in.' They really captured that innocence of the women... almost like art...there was nothing ever skanky about the photos. \n\"I would always pick up the Playboys and think, 'God these women are so beautiful and it's so beautiful.' There was nothing that I felt was too embarrassing or gross. And nothing that I'm not proud of today.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:56:14.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
