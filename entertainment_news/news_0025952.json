The funds will provide much needed funding for art facilitators at Little City's Center for the Arts. Currently, 10 professional artists serve as facilitators at the Center for the Arts, where they provide guidance for the more than 75 artists with intellectual and developmental disabilities who use the studios and available supplies to create art.\n\"100 Women Who Care is all about women pooling their resources to help others. We know that our donation to support the facilitators at Little City's Center for the Arts will have a significant impact on the lives of the men and women who use the center to express themselves creatively. We are proud to support their efforts,\" says Laurie Richter, founder of 100 Women Who Care North Suburban Chicago.\nThe group’s mission is to use the power of collective giving to make a difference in the north suburbs of Chicago. It meets quarterly to pick a local charity to support, with members each contributing to the cause. The funds from 100 Women Who Care will go a long way toward allowing Little City to continue to provide facilitators, who serve a vital role in the program. Facilitators introduce new materials and techniques to the artists, coordinate larger projects involving more than one artist, and provide suggestions to individual artists on how to complete works.\nThe facilitators, which are sustained entirely from private donations, are essential to the program. \"Each year it is a greater challenge to fully fund this part of the program,\" says Bev Saiz, Director of Foundation and Government Relations at Little City.\nThe Center for the Arts offers participants from Little City and other area organizations a place dedicated to allowing them to create art. The program is designed to provide a sense of purpose and empowerment for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Center for the Arts has received 30 awards during its more than 20-year history.\nArtwork by Little City artists has been displayed in local, national and international venues, and it is the subject of \"Share My Kingdom,\" a documentary about three Little City artists with disabilities. The film, made possible through a grant from the Chicago Community Trust, premiered at the Gene Siskel Film Center and is scheduled to be shown Oct. 18 at the Bridgeport Art Center in Chicago.\n100 Women Who Care North Suburban Chicago was founded by Laurie Richter of Lincolnshire with assistance from Susan Rubin Elfant of Northbrook, Andrea Friedlander of Deerfield, Ada Kinscherff of Lincolnshire and Stacey Meyer of Deerfield. The group meets quarterly to pick a local charity to support. Any member of the group can nominate a qualified local charity, and three members are randomly selected at each meeting to make a presentation in support of their nomination. At the end of the presentations, the group votes, and each member writes a $100 check to the winning charity. Although the meetings last just one hour, many members come early or stay late for a fun Girls Night Out at the hosting venue.
