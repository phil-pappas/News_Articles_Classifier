Now, Staley is working to raise money for a scholarship in Watkins’ memory. \nStaley, whose work is in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and the European Ceramic Work Centre in the Netherlands, among others, will be selling his pottery from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 24, at the Lemont Art Alliance, 824 Pike Street in Lemont. Eighty percent of the proceeds from the sale will go to the Taylor Watkins Ceramic Award. \nWatkins, an alumnus of the Penn State School of Visual Arts, died of cancer in 2013. A promising ceramicist, he was planning to pursue graduate studies before his life was abruptly cut short. The award will provide financial support to undergraduate students enrolled in the College of Arts and Architecture who have demonstrated outstanding talent in ceramics. \nBefore Watkins died, Staley flew to Florida to spend some time with him. Chris told Taylor he made a positive impact on everyone he met, and that he wanted to create an award in his name. “I will never forget the smile of gratitude on Taylor's face,” said Staley. Watkins died two weeks later. \nStaley and friends have been working to raise $20,000 to establish the award. The pottery sale will supplement money raised during a crowdfunding campaign that took place in fall 2014. To learn more, visit https://sova.psu.edu/story/taylor-made-campaign .
