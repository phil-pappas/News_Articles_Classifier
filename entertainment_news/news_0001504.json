It will feature songs from the movie, new music by Lloyd Webber and a book by \"Downton Abbey\" creator Julian Fellowes.\n\"It kind of takes me back to the time when I was able to write with children and work with children,\" Lloyd Webber said of the new production at the launch of the promotional video on Wednesday. \"It was a bit of fresh air really.\"\nThe video shows Finn, played by Broadway actor Alex Brightman, with the young cast performing \"You're In the Band\" in the classroom -- a song where the teacher turns his students into a rock band.\nViewers can scroll around the room, where the black boards have references to Lloyd Webber's past musicals and the ceiling shows the lyrics for the song.\nLloyd Webber said the video was shot in one take.\n\"It's happening all around you, all in one go. It's all in one take, you can't edit it because everybody is always in a different position,\" he said. \"It was a great experiment.\"\nThe \"School of Rock\" film which starred Jack Black as Finn, grossed more than $131 million at box offices worldwide.\n(Reporting By Alicia Powell in New York; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in London; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:52:10.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
