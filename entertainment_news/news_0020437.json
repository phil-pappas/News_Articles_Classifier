Tweet \nFormer WWE and WCW star Syxx-Pac will appear on a show at the Saddlers Club tomorrow night, adjacent to Walsall FC's Banks's Stadium, writes Craig Birch. \nThe 43-year-old, real name Sean Waltman, was a face best known from WCW's famous faction the New World Order and WWE's D-Generation X in the Attitude Era. \nHe will take part in a six-man tag encounter alongside Powell's alter ego 'Mad Dog Maxx' and Kris Navarro, against the team of Johnny Thunder, Tom Mason and Big Paulie. \nMost VIP seats have already sold but a number are still available and will be on the door tonight, which opens at 6.30pm for a 7.30pm start. \nThen, seven days later, WWE Hall of Famer and Wrestlemania main-eventer Ted Dibiase will be at the Crown Suites, formerly Willenhall Baths. \nThe venue has a rich heritage for wrestling stretching back to the 1950s, with the legendary Kendo Nagasaki making his debut there. It was the same year the Baths hosted a Rolling Stones gig, 1964. \nDibiase is renowned for his character, ability to talk on the mic and his trademark laugh. In his heyday, he was a fine technical performer. \nThe 61-year-old cannot compete, due to the neck injury that ended his career in 1993, but will be playing a major part when the show starts.
