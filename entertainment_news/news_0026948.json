He said when the bandits ended up with $6 million, there was elation. The joy turned to fear that they'd be robbed themselves once word got out about the score. \nValenti testified that he and Asaro each got a $750,000 cut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:32:05.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
