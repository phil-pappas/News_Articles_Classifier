Discussing how the only Bollywood face in the house Rimi Sen is in the house for a reason, Suyyash adds that there was a reason why Shahid Kapoor and Salman Khan were telling Rimi to be herself.

While a few contestants willingly sacrificed their safety, a few were seen at loggerheads with each other.\nWhen Bigg Boss gives the contestants a chance to reclaim their lost bags, excitement becomes a prominent emotion. Calling it the 'Nilami Task', Bigg Boss tells them that the four contestants without their bags (Keith, Suyyash, Prince and Digangana) are required to bid for their bags.

They go ahead and bid for their bags, putting a heavy price against their bags. On the other hand, Keith opts out of the opportunity by writing a big fat zero on the board, understanding that the prize money is important for all contestants. While Suyyash, Prince and Digangana receive their bags, Keith's intelligence gets him everyone's empathy but not his bags.\nAll hell breaks loose when the housemates realise that the prize money now stands at Rs. 39,66,667!\nWhen Kishwer hyperventilates about the money getting deducted, a peace-loving Roopal bluntly tells her to stop trying to get footage by fighting and raising her voice. This irks Kishwer who asks her if she is trying to make a point just because Salman told her she is coming across as silent.
