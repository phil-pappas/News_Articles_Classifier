Combining the efficient principles of classical stationary indoor cycling (spinning) with the healthy and soothing powers of water, this submerged Spin class claims to burn at least 800 calories per session.\nThe new trend of spinning underwater. Picture: Supplied Aquaspin uses the benefits of water buoyancy and resistance to make the exercise motions and sequences gentle yet vigorous. Each session is tailored to provide a full body workout, using various fitness techniques in order to get the most out of each minute.\nFrom the water to the sand, what about this for a new way to walk off the weight? It’s called the SandTrek , and as the name suggests, allows users to walk for miles in the sand — even if they don’t live by the beach.\nSand trekking treadmill, which will be on display at the Fitness & Health Expo. Picture: Sand Trekking Still in the prototype stage, the SandTrek brings the beach to the gym by providing a natural walk-on-sand experience to the treadmill surface. Your feet touch the sand and sink into it giving you the exact experience of running or walking on the beach.\n“We only have a prototype at the moment, which cost us $25,000 to make. But if we were to make the product commercially, we would sell around $12,000 — $15,000,” said Handball champion and SandTrek creator, Hamad Janali Ghorbani\n “It’s a good machine for rehabilitation, especially for those who have had ankle or knee surgery. Exercising on the sand has less impact on the joints by up to 50 per cent It’s a great solution for older people who can’t make it to the beach”.\n“You can run on the machine, as it has a maximum speed of 7km/per hour,” Hamad said.\nBut if you’re looking for something less beachy, and love dance-style classes, such as Zumba or Sh’Bam, then this trend will have you jumping for joy — literally. It’s called ‘ Kangoo Power ’ and challenges the whole body by building muscular strength and cardio-respiratory endurance simultaneously.\nKangoo Power in action. Picture: Supplied. Requiring a pair of specially designed bouncing shoes, this exercise class is designed to keep you fit, while having a lot of fun as well. But, taking part in a workout like this will set you back — these stylish shoes costing around $300 brand new.\nThese Kangoo Shoes will set you back around $300. Picture: Supplied. “The classes go for an hour, which are high-intensity workouts. Our classes start with beginners, but there are also sessions for those more advanced. You can borrow shoes if you need, or buy them if you like,” said Magda Xantopol, Kangoo Jumps instructor at Mix-Fit.\n“Kangoo Jumps is good for cardiovascular fitness, increasing oxygen flow and good for balance and bone density. In one hour you can burn around 500 calories — and entertaining,” she said.\nEach of the above fitness trends will be on display at the Fitness & Health Expo , which kicks off its national tour in Sydney on October 17 and 18.\nOriginally published as Fitness trends taking over summer", "external_links": ["http://www.mix-fit.net.au/kangoo-jumps/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd83773b71a8b26d8a5ecde3ff3bd1ea?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/fitness/meet-the-new-fitness-trends-taking-over-this-summer/story-fnlsv23r-1227564227690?sv=42f74d26ac360f25f380cdc89f51e018", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84bbff6ab76cdb152e1bfacba74aca51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4507a4129f8ce30701815550ba21338f?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/661d28ba08499db58de471efcb975ce8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e0ecc9764913631058b7c705f58abf7d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/66fa58f3fe82a85da51248d48a4fa31a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eaa09b554f6a6cd6fc9b7489b9a5a0fd?width=650", "http://www.aquaspin.sg/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f8a681864db4d6f4c482421d92ee3302?width=650", "http://sandtrek.com/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7f9c8d60468fee74cfd347f61cd6227b", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "https://www.fitnessexpo.com.au/sydney", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ea6ca1a98282e6bba934db59ccd98576"], "published": "2015-10-10T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:22:33.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
