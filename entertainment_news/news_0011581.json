Didn't see it coming but (I am) beyond delighted.”\nMichael Oberholtzer, Geneva Carr, Steven Boyer, Marc Kudisch, and Sarah Stiles in \"Hand to God.\" Saget takes over for Marc Kudisch, who’s leaving to work on the play “Baritones Unbound,” which he conceived and co-wrote.\n“Hand to God” runs through Jan. 3 in New York, then before transfers to the West End. Performances in London begin Feb. 5.\njdziemianowicz@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:55:44.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
