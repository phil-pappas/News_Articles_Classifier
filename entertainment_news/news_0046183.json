This moving memoir shares her life story, how she came close to dying three times, how she passed through the trials and tribulations and by God’s grace, grew to know his abiding presence and loving care. Barker-Pittman began writing this memoir decades ago and has found the perspective offered by time’s passing a blessing. After having survived a close encounter with death , she and her family avoided a head-on highway collision. She has witnessed God’s power to work both on the peaks and in the valleys of life . Enduring trials has given her an insight: “Do not give up. Love, find your fate, and, above all, forgive!”\nWritten in friendly and conversational tone, “I’m Glad You Know Me!” lets readers traverse the life-altering jolts and dips as well as the easier stretches of routine days. The journey ends with a close encounter of the third kind, one more wonderful and miraculous than a movie-title reference would imply. Barker-Pittman believes that life is too short to cling to painful experiences. She encourages readers to let go and forgive one another instead.\nAn excerpt from the book:\nThe still quietness, twilight of the night and scarce motion of traffic made the travel very relaxing that calm caused sleep to fall upon the passengers.
