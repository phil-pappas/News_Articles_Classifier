Renel Brooks-Moon, the Giants’ public address announcer, shows off her World Series ring. Photo: Tk Behind Renel’s departure from ‘Kiss’ morning show 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Renel Brooks-Moon , better known just as Renel, is a Bay Area radio icon. But, in today’s media landscape, iconic personalities are not immune to corporate priorities.\nIn September, iHeart Media announced that she had left her morning show on KISQ (“Kiss FM” at 98.1), but would remain on the station with her one-hour feature at noon, “Renel’s Record Party .” In a news release, Don Parker , senior vice president of programming for iHeart San Francisco, implied that it was Brooks-Moon’s decision to leave. “We appreciate that her expanding obligations outside of iHeart Media don’t make it possible for her to host a daily, live morning show in the future,” he said.\nThis did not sound right. Yes, Brooks-Moon has been the San Francisco Giants ’ public address announcer for 16 years. But by mid-September, their season was just about over. What “obligations”? I contacted Brooks-Moon, and she didn’t want to go into specifics. But she would not say that it was her decision to leave. “Things change,” she offered, “and it was time for everyone to go in different directions.”\nBrooks-Moon, who joined KISQ in 1997 after a dozen years on KFRC and KMEL, left in 2009 but returned a year later. In 2011, she was teamed with Christie James . (James’ new co-host is Chino , who moved over from sister station KYLD, “Wild 94.9.”)\nFor some time, it’s been speculated that Brooks-Moon, who often worked evening Giants games, recorded bits and features for her show, allowing her to co-host in absentia. “Yeah, it’s true,” she said. But, grateful to maintain a presence on KISQ, she said no more.\nParker, however, did. Station management wanted a “fully live morning show,” he said, and “it was entirely her decision that she couldn’t do a live show. ... She would have liked to have stayed on doing a largely prerecorded show, which we don’t think, in this competitive environment, makes a lot of sense. She made it clear that her schedule was too demanding for her to do a live radio show, and we think that’s critical.” \nOver the years, Parker said, the station accommodated Brooks-Moon’s need to record segments that co-host James would blend into the show. “It evolved over time and became more prerecorded. We can’t continue with that. It needs to have that live interaction.”\nBut, he noted, “we continue to have a great relationship; Renel is on the station every day.”\nI asked Brooks-Moon, who didn’t do a farewell show, if she had a message for listeners. She responded, “I just want to say thanks for supporting me and listening all these years and sending great, uplifting e-mails and having my back.”\nAs for her “demanding” schedule, Brooks-Moon said she is spending time with family and is open to offers. She does voice work and hopes to write a memoir. As a community ambassador for the Giants, she said, “I’m out there in the community, meeting fans all the time.” Hosting the opening of a Little League field in Atherton named after Willie Mays , she was able to introduce her mother, Juanita Brooks , to the Giants legend. “And she told him all his records,” she said. “I cherish these moments.”\nRandom notes: In news about morning hosts not leaving their shows, JV , on “Wild 94.9,” has signed a new contract, one that expands his workload. Long a talk show host, he has added a revived “The Dog House with JV and Elvis ” on sister KKSF (“Talk 910”) weekdays from 4 to 6 p.m. Also, JV’s production company will provide content for “The Dog House Channel ” on iHeart Radio … After three years with the syndicated Steve Harvey show on KBLX (102.9), Entercom has replaced him with comedian Mark Curry . The Bay Area native, star of the early ’90s sitcom “Hangin’ With Mr. Cooper,” is partnered with station vets Kimmie Taylor and Victor “ Big Daddy ” Zaragoza from 6 to 9 a.m. … Chino , who moved from afternoons on “Wild 94.9” to join KISQ, has been replaced by another DJ using a single name, Julian , who’s worked in Chicago and Washington, D.C., and, most recently, at KZZP in Phoenix …\nR.I.P.: Tom Parker died on Oct. 3 in Portland, Ore., from kidney and liver ailments. Parker, who was 64, is best remembered in these parts for his work, as “ Big Tom Parker ,” on KFRC, KYUU, and KIOI (“K-101”) from 1976 to 1986. (His real name was Richard Altree .) In 2010, he became communications director at Lines for Life, a nonprofit in Portland that works to prevent substance abuse and suicide. Friend and media exec Rob Sisco remembered him as “a sensational air talent and one of the nicest and most gentle people you’ll ever meet. He was incredibly generous, working with dozens of charities and organizations lending his time and talent.” … And we note, with respect, the passing of Don Wiegandt , whose 37-year career was most noted for his time on KCBS as financial editor in the ’80s and ’90s. He died Sept. 24 at age 81.\nSackamenna kid: That Gov. Jerry Brown : What a kidder. He was having lunch at Perry’s on Union Street a couple weeks ago, sitting at a sidewalk table with an old buddy, entrepreneur and longtime Brown supporter Maurice Kanbar . I went out to say hello. He asked what I was up to, and I mentioned that, among other things, I wrote the radio column for The Chronicle .\n“A radio column?” he asked, incredulously. “Who listens to the radio? Are they still making radios?” Assured that the medium is alive and OK, the former Oakland mayor asked, “What do they play on KSAN these days?” Told that it plays classic rock, he dropped some knowledge on me: “It used to be country-western.” True dat. After its run as a free-form rock station, “the Jive 95” switched to country in 1980.\nThe governor asked, “Who does country now?” I mentioned the syndicated “Nash FM” stations, and, again, he drifted into the past. “Have you heard of KRAK radio?” he asked, evoking a Sacramento country station dating back to the ’50s. “Does that still exist?” No, I ventured. It’s probably been taken over by a cocaine cartel. Laughs all around, and then the governor said, “Well, that exhausts my radio knowledge.”\nAnd, despite my wisecrack, the fact is that KRAK-AM lives on, as a sports talk station in Hesperia, north of San Bernardino. Its slogan? “High Desert 910.”\nBen Fong-Torres is a freelance writer.
