The Dance Moms star has been indicted for fraud, according to the United States Attorney's Office. \n\"Criminal prosecution is appropriate when debtors corrupt the bankruptcy process through deceit and lies before the court,\" said U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton in a statement . \nAccording to the 20-count indictment, Miller filed a petition to reorganize her dance studio in 2010, and then allegedly devised a plan to defraud the bankruptcy court by lying about money she'd earned between 2012 and 2013 from her TV deals and Masterclass studio sessions, as well as her apparel and merchandise sales. \nThe indictment also alleges that Miller secretly created bank accounts to hide that income, which totaled more than $755,000 and, as a result, gained better terms to restructure her debt. \nIf convicted, Miller faces up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each count of the indictment. \nA rep for Dance Moms has not yet responded to a request for comment. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
