The tour uses 500 pairs of shoes and 450 costumes. Madonna prepared the show with twenty backup dancers spending three months putting in 14-hour days, six days a week, of rehearsals. \"Finishing my record was filled with panic and pressure because of all the leaks, so I wasn't really thinking about my live show until I released the record and started making videos and doing my promo show,\" the \"Like a Virgin\" singer shares, \"So honestly, I didn't really try to sit down and get my head around it until last March. That's unusual for me because I usually start thinking way, way, way in advance.\" Madonna says the primary themes of her tour are \"empowerment,\" \"sex\" and \"religion.\" She goes on to explain why she never took the easy route to just take 15 biggest hits and stick to the original arrangements on her concerts. \"I just couldn't do it,\" she reveals, \"Because I've changed, and sonics have changed.\" \"The sound of a synth or an 808 [drum machine] ... everything has just changed so much. If you put the exact song next to something new, it just sounds so small and mono. You know what I mean? They just can't live together,\" she adds. Madonna explains how doing a live show is different from making movies or recording an album. \"Well, there's nothing like a live show, obviously. Living on the edge, being out, never knowing what's going to happen, it's a dangerous place to be. You make mistakes, you've got to with those mistakes. You know, each audience is different. I love when the audience is alive and plays with me, like it was in Brooklyn.\" \"For me, when you're onstage, there's no cheating. There's just no cheating,\" she continues, \"When you're in the studio you can do another take, you can fix things, you can re-tune your vocals. When you're making a film you can go into the edit suite, you can fix things in post-production. I mean, it's not live. A concert is just a whole different world.\" During a recent show in Philadelphia, Madonna talked a lot about Pope Francis, who visited Philadelphia's Benjamin Franklin Parkway in the same week of her show. The \"Papa Don't Preach\" singer used a giant cross as a stripping pole and writhed around on a re-creation of the Last Supper table as she said, \"Yeezus loves my pussy best... Popey-wopey is on his way over. I think he's stalking me.\" When asked about the funny coincidence, Madonna says, \"It's hilarious, yes. I'm hoping that we run into each other. I have a long relationship with the Pope, with the Vatican, with the Catholic Church, with my excommunication. Anyway, you know, I was raised a Catholic, and no matter what spiritual path I might go down, I always feel some kind of inexplicable connection with Catholicism. It kind of shows up in all of my work, as you may have noticed.\" The \"Like a Prayer\" songstress believed Pope Francis is \"the kind of Pope you could sit down and have a cup of tea with, and/or that you could make a joke about something and he would laugh about it.\" While the Pope tried to stop her \"Blond Ambition Tour\" in Rome, the singer thinks he would enjoy her show \"because at the end of the day, the message of my show is about love, and that's his message.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Browse Madonna Pictures More Madonna News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:57:18.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
