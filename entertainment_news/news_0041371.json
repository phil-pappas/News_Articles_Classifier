Film director Brett Ratner will direct the concert's livestream from Madison Square Garden. \n\"People who want to hear the music get to hear it for free and we get to promote our music and share it with people,\" Bob Weir said in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday. \nFans can enter to win tickets Monday through Thursday on Dead & Company's website. No tickets for the show will go on sale. \nGrateful Dead's Weir, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann are part of Dead & Company with Mayer; Phil Lesh is not involved. \nThe group is performing a string of U.S. dates on a fall tour, which kicks off Oct. 29 in Albany, New York. \n\"We're about halfway in and rehearsals are going well, if I may say,\" Weir said. \"We've been through 45 or 50 tunes and I'm not going to tell you that we have them entirely locked down, but we have a good handle on them.\" \nThe band is encouraging fans who attend the show or watch the livestream to donate to the Robin Hood Foundation, an organization fighting poverty in New York City. \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:00:36.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
