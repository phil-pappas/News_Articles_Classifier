The producers of \" X Burlesque \" and \"X Rocks\" have now set a Nov. 22 opening for \"X Country\" at Harrah's Las Vegas.\nThe \"Kick'n topless revue\" is the latest cabaret show from producers Angela and Matt Stabile, who are building on the \"X\" brand which dates back to 2002. \"X Burlesque\" debuted at the Flamingo in 2007 and \"X Rocks\" opened at the Rio in 2013.\n\"X Country\" seems logical, given country radio's current embrace of rock and rhythm, and the apparent legal mandate that every Las Vegas topless show since 2004 include a number with cowboy hats and Daisy Duke micro-shorts set to Big & Rich's \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy).\"\nHowever, the new revue promises an array of country tunes, from Patsy Cline to Hank Williams Jr. and Garth Brooks and into the present with Taylor Swift and Tim McGraw.\nThe show will run in a 10:30 p.m. time slot as a roommate to \"Million Dollar Quartet\" at Harrah's, perhaps forcing a musically-based choiced between it and \"X Burlesque\" at the Flamingo.\nRead more from Mike Weatherford at reviewjournal.com.
