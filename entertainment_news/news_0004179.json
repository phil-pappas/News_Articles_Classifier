As a window into how artists as different as Glenn Ligon, Leonardo Drew, Carrie Mae Weems and Kehinde Wiley are exploring the slippery terrain of racial and gender identities, politics, power relationships and what it means today to be a black artist (or an artist who happens to be black), the show reveals razor-sharp hipness and present-tense cultural critiques not often seen at the DIA.

Curator's Choice: 5 favorites from '30 Americans' \nNot that we've been waiting for this show specifically. Any ambitious exhibition of African-American art is long overdue at the DIA. It's been 9 years since the museum last hosted a large-scale show devoted to black artists, and that too was a preexisting single-collector survey (Walter O. Evans Collection) rather than a homegrown show. Since the DIA created its landmark General Motors Center for African American Art in 2000 and curator Valerie Mercer came aboard in 2001 to head the center, the museum hasn't originated a single major special exhibition of African-American art. DIA director salary could rise to $475K by 2020 \nThe DIA hasn't ignored black artists. There were two imported historical shows nearly 15 years ago devoted to Jacob Lawrence and black photographers, along with a homegrown 2007 solo exhibition devoted to the Ethiopian-born Julie Mehretu (who was raised mostly in Michigan), organized by former DIA curator Becky Hart. Mercer organized an in-house survey of the museum's African-American collection in 2003 that blossomed during the DIA's renovation into an entire suite of galleries devoted to African-American art. The DIA remains the only encyclopedic museum in the country with a curatorial department and galleries dedicated to black artists. (African-American art is also integrated into other parts of the permanent collection.) \nBut given the commitment that the GM Center and permanent galleries embody and the fact that Detroit is nearly 80% black, the museum should be a more aggressive leader in exhibiting, collecting and researching African-American art. Getting a buzz going \nWhich brings us back to \"30 Americans.\" Considering the context, it's an especially important show for the DIA and its audiences — significant enough and of sufficient quality to set aside the concerns over conflicts of interest and curatorial control that make single-collector shows problematic. The exhibition has also engendered greater anticipatory buzz among metro Detroit artists, black and white, and contemporary art aficionados, than any DIA show in recent memory. \nThe Detroit installation, which was overseen by Mercer in collaboration with one of the museum's interpretive specialists, Alison Jean, groups the art into seven categories, each getting its own gallery: Defying, Sampling, Freestyling, Confronting, Signifying, Transforming and Representing. (More on these in a moment.) \nThe 31 artists in the show begin with seminal figures like the sly, representational painters Robert Colescott (1929-2009) and Barkley L. Hendricks (b. 1945) and the comet-like expressionist Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88), whose jazzy, graffiti-like mark making suggests a bebop and hip-hop marriage. His electric early painting \"Bird on the Money\" (1981), named for the modern jazz genius Charlie (Bird) Parker, an alto saxophonist who succumbed to drugs at an early age much like Basquiat, is a jaw-dropper.

(Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press) \nThere are also influential mid-career stars like Kara Walker, 45, whose signature black silhouette forms in \"Camptown Ladies\" sweep across perpendicular walls in an uncomfortably seductive swirl of horrific imagery of the antebellum South. And there are a plethora of younger artists like Kalup Linzy, 38, whose hilarious soap opera parody video features himself as a starlet dressed in drag, and Mickalene Thomas, 44, whose collage-like painting \"Hotter Than July\" presents a smoldering black woman, reclining, staring proudly right at us, her shirt more than teasingly open and her skirt riding up her thigh. \nThomas is working on multiple levels; the painting is at once decorative and conceptual. On the one hand, there's the pop-art punch of her forms, color and patterns, rendered with real rhinestones on the canvas. But Thomas, like a lot of the artists here, is also riffing on art history, co-opting the male gaze into a statement of Afro-powered feminism. \nMost of the artists in the exhibition work in figurative styles, and the Rubells clearly are attracted to art in which representations of \"blackness\" are visible on the surface. There's nothing wrong with that, but one of the unspoken tensions that percolates through the exhibition is the longstanding debate over aesthetics, authenticity and abstraction in African-American art, especially the push-pull of art-for-art's sake and art based on black subjects or dedicated to political goals. Sampling or influence? \nBack to the DIA's seven thematic divisions. At their best, they provide an illuminating context or grouping. \"Confronting\" links six works that directly address the history of racism in American. The pieces include some of the most emotionally powerful moments in the show: Walker's \"Camptown Ladies,\" Hank Willis Thomas' sardonic take on a Mastercard \"priceless\" commercial via text overlaid on a photograph of a son's funeral. Gary Simmons' \"Duck, Duck, Noose,\" a devastating installation in which Ku Klux Klan hats sit on stools in a classroom-like circle — while an empty noose hangs in the center. Buy Photo \nThe display made out of wood, cloth, metal and hemp titled \"Duck, Duck, Noose\" by Gary Simmons is one of many exhibits that can been seen at \"30 Americans\" at the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit on Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015. (Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press) \nThe African-American tradition of \"signifying,\" of employing verbal or aesthetic gamesmanship to communicate on multiple levels, helps decode a work like Leonardo Drew's monolithic wall made of cotton and wax that can be read as minimalist sculpture or a trickster evocation of the long shadow of slavery and today's social and institutional racism. \nElsewhere, however, the art seems almost randomly applied to the various categories, and the texts are so simplified as to be misleading. To cite one example, \"sampling\" means something specific in hip-hop: producers borrowing preexisting recordings to provide a foundation for their music. But in the exhibition labels, sampling includes a jazz musician making reference to another culture. That's not sampling; that's influence. The visual art analog to sampling is described as drawing images, ideas and styles from historical and global sources. \nSorry, but that's so vague as to be meaningless. Almost every work in the exhibition qualifies as sampling under that umbrella. Which doesn't mean that it might not be a useful concept in explaining some of the art. But beware of the racial quicksand. Why are black artists who quote earlier styles or work with found objects said to be \"sampling,\" but white artists employing the same ideas are seen to be engaged in what the art world has recognized for decades as post-modern appropriation? \nThe other problem with the DIA's interpretive scaffolding is what seems a soft-pedaling of the political content — the subversiveness, nuanced complexity and edge — of some of the art. Kehinde Wiley's shrewd and sumptuous portraits are saying something profound about the humanity, power and dignity of black men in an age when \"Black Lives Matter\" has become a rallying cry and interactions with police have left an alarming number of black men beaten or killed. \nIt's impossible not to think of this in front of Wiley's miraculous 25-foot long \"Sleep,\" which suggests Christ taken down from the cross, or \"Triple Portrait of Charles I,\" which marries decorative splendor, mugshot poses and the coded urban uniform of a hoodie. Still, while the labels don't reflect the urgency and high stakes that you can feel on the street and in the news, you'll feel it standing in front of Wiley's painting.
