We wanted to make it an immersive experience.\"\n\n- Criticism from family -\n\nThough the film has drawn criticism from its outset by Jobs' widow Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple CEO Tim Cook, it was supported by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who acted as an advisor for the movie.\nFassbender admitted the criticism had given him some concerns before he agreed to slip on Jobs' signature black polo neck sweater and round glasses and portray him for the film.\n\"To be honest, it did make me hesitate,\" before taking the part, Fassbender said.\n\"I have the utmost respect for Steve Jobs, so hopefully when they see it, if they see it, they won't feel hurt by it and it certainly wasn't my attempt.\"\nWinslet, who won an Oscar for best actress for 2008's \"The Reader\", said that she had been struck by the \"incredible loyalty\" of those around Jobs.\n\"I had a kind of backstage access in terms of information about Steve and stories about him and I can honestly say that if I had met him, I think I would have quite liked him,\" Winslet said.\n\"Do I think he was extraordinary? Yes.\"\nAmong the 238 feature films that appeared over the festival's 12 days, the event this year chose to highlight in particular the struggles of women through choices such as \"Suffragette\" on the campaign for votes for women.\nAlso shown were \"He named me Malala\", a documentary about the youngest ever Nobel Peace laureate, \"Carol\", about a love story between two women, and \"Truth\", about an investigation of the military record of former US President George W. Bush led by Mary Mapes.\nThe festival also celebrated the career of Australian actress Cate Blanchett, who was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship for outstanding contribution to film.\nInformation Technology Arts & Entertainment Steve Jobs Michael Fassbender Apple Aaron Sorkin Kate Winslet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:28:15.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
