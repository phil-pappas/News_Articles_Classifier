DeLorean of the DeLorean Motor Car Co. holds press conference at his Park Avenue office on the restructuring of his company. Behind is photo car bearing his name. In 2014, the widow of automaker John DeLorean sued a Texas company she said has been illegally using the DeLorean name for years. The two sides in the lawsuit reached a preliminary settlement in June, 2015, that would pay an undisclosed amount of money to Sally DeLorean, who lives in New Jersey with her daughter. But her attorney wrote in a letter to the judge this week that the company's lawyers were trying to change the settlement at the last minute. The DMC-12, known simply as \"the DeLorean,\" was driven by Michael J. Fox in the movie and has since gained a cult following.
