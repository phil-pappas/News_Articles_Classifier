Right to property, right to employment, and right to settlement”. Shah further added that J&K will become like any other state where people from any part of India will have the right to own property. \nThe hearing of the petition by the Supreme Court is scheduled on November 3. Prior to that the atmosphere in the valley is already tense after a young man was attacked for allegedly transporting cows for slaughter. Local public committees, trade bodies, civil society are gearing up to form public opinion. \nArticle 35 A was extended to J&K by President Rajendra Prasad on May 14, 1954. It was devised to protect to state laws that had been the Maharaja’s rule before independence. \nPrior to this Article 35A has been challenged in the Supreme Court three times. Similar petitions have been dismissed by the Apex Court thrice, in 1956, 1961 and 1970. \nKashmiri’s believe that there is a huge conspiracy going on against them to scrap article 35 A. The writ petition is widely seen in the valley to damage JK’s special position and force demographic changes in Kashmir in the longer run. \nObservers believe that all eyes are on the coalition government of BJP and People Democratic Party, which has to take a stand in court. \nFrom various part of the valley, whether its a banned student outfit, of Kashmir High Court Bar association or opposition parties, all have decided to challenge the petition which will be kept in front of a small bench of judges on November 3. \n  2:09 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:02:41.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
