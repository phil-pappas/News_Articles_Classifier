The studio is teaming up with comic book publisher Double Take to give \" Z-Men \", a graphic novel about zombie, a movie treatment. Written by creator Jeff McComsey, \"Z-Men\" is the flagship title from Double Take, a subsidiary of videogame developer and publisher Take-Two Interactive Software. The graphic novel is set in the time and place of the horror classic \"Night of the Living Dead\". It follows a pair of buddy cops, Secret Service agents Stuart and Clancy, sent to investigate the appearance of a zombie. They later find a huge amount of zombies in town and quickly realize that they are trapped in an apocalypse. \"We are pleased to expand our partnership with Lionsgate, who has the right team to bring to life on screen what Double Take brings to life in comics,\" said Double Take General Manager Bill Jemas. \"We look forward to seeing Lionsgate's creativity transform the 'Z-Men' story into an exciting feature film, and everyone on the Double Take team is incredibly enthused at this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" This is not the first time that Lionsgate has made an adaptation with Take-Two. The two also team up to turn Gearbox Software's popular video game \" Borderlands \" into a feature film. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:45:05.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
