It was later confirmed by \"Top Model's\" current home, the CW. \n\"Thinking #ANTM22 should be our last cycle,\" the supermodel and TV personality wrote. \"I truly believe it's time. May your pics be forever fierce. Keep on Smizing!\" \nThis season's final episode, which is scheduled to air at 9 p.m. Dec. 4, will serve as the series finale. The network is currently in discussions about broadcasting a retrospective special that will air sometime in late 2016. \nAt the height of its game, \"Top Model\" was one of the top-rated programs on UPN, as well as on the CW after that channel's 2006 merger with WB. In addition to giving added exposure to fashion-industry insiders like Janice Dickinson, Twiggy and Nigel Barker by making them judges, it also launched the careers of model/reality TV star Adrianne Curry, actress Analeigh Tipton and many others who have had success on and off the runways. \nSince \"America's Next Top Model\" began airing in 2003, host Tyra Banks has crowned multiple winners from the Chicago area including first-season champion Adrienne Curry from Joliet and eighth-season winner Jaslene Gonzalez, who grew up in Humboldt Park.

Its current cycle aired for a couple of months this summer on Wednesday before moving to Friday two weeks ago. It's currently averaging about 1.25 million same-night viewers. \nThe news comes amidst the CW's transition away from fare more often associated with teen girls and young women to superhero series like \"The Flash\" and \"Arrow.\" On Tuesday, the channel announced that it was ending romance-focused procedural \"Beauty and the Beast\" after the show's fourth season. \n\"'America's Next Top Model' was a successful franchise for two networks, first at UPN and then The CW, and it became not just a ratings hit, but a global pop culture phenomenon,\" said CW president Mark Pedowitz. \"I want to thank Tyra and Ken for all their years of success in establishing a show that was not just popular in the U.S., but all across the world. \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:07:45.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
