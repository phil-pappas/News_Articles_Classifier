Coronation Street's Sarah Platt to spill beans on Callum Logan's death? \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nCoronation Street star Tina O’Brien has revealed her character is on the verge of telling the truth about Callum Logan’s demise. \nThe 32-year-old actress, who has reprised her role as Sarah Platt in the ITV soap, has been struggling to cope with the situation when she discovers Callum’s body is actually buried beneath her home. Sarah with Callum (Joseph Scanlon/ITV) \n“Sarah is an absolute mess and is desperate to talk about everything that’s gone on to someone who’ll understand,” Tina told Inside Soap. \nHer sister-in-law Kylie (Paula Lane) killed Callum (Sean Ward) when she hit him over the head, and she delivers the news to Sarah that her ex’s body is actually in a drain. \nTina continued: “She’s barely holding it together, and is very much the weak link in this scenario. David’s already worried sick that she’ll go and say something about what happened to Callum – and it seems he’s right to be concerned. \n“Sarah needs someone to offload to – while Kylie and David have each other, Sarah’s got nobody.” Sarah and Kylie (ITV) \nIt doesn’t help that Sarah feels responsible for the bad boy’s death, which took place on the live episode on September 23. \n“Sarah definitely blames herself for his death. She’s terrified she’s going to blurt it all out. Sarah really can’t deal with the fact that Callum will always be there, inside her home,” the actress explained. \n“That horrible knowledge throws her into another tailspin and she just can’t take it. I don’t know the outcome but I don’t think this will stay secret forever. Something like that would keep on eating at you until it was eventually exposed.” \nTina added: “But Sarah won’t want to go down for being an accessory to murder, and she’ll want to protect her family no matter what it takes. So who knows?” Share article \nCoronation Street continues on ITV.
