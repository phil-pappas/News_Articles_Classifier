Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Linda Wampler White’s poignant tale reminds the reader that there is never certainty in life and sometimes one learns to love in the oddest of circumstances.\n\"The Major\" is a love story. It is a story of how an honest, ordinary man, with a little more of life's road behind him than ahead, accepts and deals with the unexpected. As a result of a promise made to his dying son to deliver a small package, a detour through an Amish community brings him face to face with an another 'unexpected' life event he could never have imagined. It is a story of how he deals with his encounter with the Brenneman family, a loving, a close-knit, well liked Amish family and the impact it has on his life and theirs.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “The Major” at bookstores everywhere or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
