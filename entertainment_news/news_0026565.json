LaRaye Ryan is one of those people. Ryan retired last month after serving as both costume coordinator and tour director for the Pensacola Children’s Chorus (PCC) – a labor of love that spanned a quarter of a century. \nThe Tulsa, Okla., native made Pensacola her permanent home in 1989. She had put her Bachelor of Science degree in business education to good use through the years, working as an office manager, a dance studio owner, a dress shop owner, and a real estate agent, among other occupations. But it was when her son, Jay, became a member of PCC as a fifth-grader in 1991 that Ryan’s life took an entirely new direction. \n“I was surprised he had the interest,” Ryan said. “I didn’t know Jay could sing. I loved being involved as a volunteer and being there with him.” \nEven though experience has honed her abilities as a costume designer, Ryan said her eye for the craft is just a gift she’s always had. In the early days, PCC performers wore uniforms, but that changed as annual productions such as “Christmas on the Coast” and “Showtime” began to evolve. \n“Little by little, the shows got bigger and bigger as they progressed to what people see today,” Ryan said. “Many times we’ve reached 10,000 separate costume pieces for a production. All of the kids would have multiple costumes, and many could have as many as six or seven.” \nRyan’s main responsibilities included designing the costumes, fitting up to 300 performers, and overseeing a team of volunteers that could reach 60 in number. She said sitting in the audience for performances was extremely rewarding, but also slightly stressful. \n“Nobody wanted to sit by me because I would always spot the crooked hat or the bow that wasn’t on quite right,” She said. “The word would always get passed back by intermission, and the next time everything would be perfect. But really, there are no words for that feeling. It was always so gratifying to see all the smiles on the faces of the kids on stage and the people in the audience. It was important to me to make sure every costume fit as perfectly as possible so that every kid was proud of their costume.” \nPCC began annual summer tours in 1995, and now there are three tours annually that have taken chorus members to destinations across the U.S., to Canada and Europe, and even on board cruise ships. Ryan had gained experience coordinating tours for Department of Defense schools while living in Germany during the 1980s. \n“I would have multiple planning meetings with the artistic directors, Allen and Susan Pote, starting in January each year and they would decide where we wanted to go,” Ryan said. \nFrom there, she would coordinate everything dealing with travel, lodging, tickets to events, and performance venues. \n“Venues were the most challenging part. Churches were a shoo-in because everyone in that world knows Allen (Pote) and everyone wanted him there. Places to perform our Broadway-style shows were more challenging because we’re so unique, but once we performed somewhere, they always wanted us to come back. Once we had the venues down, then we’d fill in all the fun stuff. The tours are so important. I would see these kids from all walks of life, and I knew that most of them would never have had the opportunity to go to the places we go.” \nRyan, of course, went on every tour for 20 years. She counts Colorado and North Carolina as her favorite destinations. \nWith all of her wonderful work as a volunteer in these vital areas, it’s no wonder that Ryan was made a PCC staff member in 2002 so she could carry on her work at an even higher level. And now comes retirement after what everyone associated with PCC, and everyone who has ever sat in the audience at a PCC show, would agree is a job extremely well done. \n“I’ll really miss all these friends I’ve made,” Ryan said. “There are so many volunteers who work so tirelessly because they believe in the program. We’ve grown together and we’re like a family. And of course, there’s the kids. I would see them leave a totally different person from the one who started. They’re exposed to the best of the best with training under the Potes. They learn music, they learn a good work ethic, and they develop self-esteem. Most of them don’t go into music or performing, but they’re all able to draw on the love and the nurturing they get with the Children’s Chorus.” 9 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1KQygow More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:59:38.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
