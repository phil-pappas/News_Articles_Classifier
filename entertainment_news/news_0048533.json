De Gano plans to use the puppet in spiritual processions and rallies -- anything having to do with peace. COURTESY OF DEACON JOHN DE GANO , COURTESY OF DEACON JOHN DE GANO Related article » St. Francis himself showed up to the celebration of the feast of St. Francis of Assisi at St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic church in Riverside over the weekend.\nWell, more accurately, a 15-foot puppet version of the 13th- century founder of the Franciscan order. He is also known for his love of nature, animals and peace – plus for being the namesake of the current pope.\nThe St. Francis puppet was the summer project of Deacon John De Gano from St. Catherine of Alexandria. The head – which alone is 31/2 feet tall – and the hands are made of papier-mache, in which strips of newspaper and a water and glue solution are used to form a shape.\nThe entire puppet is made of recycled materials, De Gano said. Acrylic paint and waterproof Varathane sealant were used.\nThe puppet requires a three-person team to operate it.\nDe Gano studied puppet-making in college and previously worked with Rob D’Arc, a puppeteer at the former Kid’s Stuff store in downtown Riverside. De Gano performed with large puppets in many Riverside Orange Blossom parades in years past.\nDe Gano said it will be used in processions and rallies such as the Stations of the Cross prayer service held outside the detention center in Adelanto.\nIt will make an appearance at spiritual or faith-based events, though not only Catholic events, where peace and/or nature is the theme, De Gano said.\n“He’ll be used anywhere we can praise God, anywhere we can give glory to God,” he said.\nContact the writer: news@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvrp38-b88532206z.120151005145752000g5mcddq6.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvrp38-b88532206z.120151005145752000g5mcddq4.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvrp38-b88532206z.120151005145752000g5mcddq4.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvrp38-b88532206z.120151005145752000g5mcddq6.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:21:53.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
