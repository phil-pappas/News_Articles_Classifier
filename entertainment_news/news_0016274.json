Continuing through October 18th, the festival will take place in several venues located throughout the city and feature more than twenty shows by national and international performers as well as installations and lectures by artists from Brazil, the Netherlands, France, South Africa and Spain.

Nowadays, we are almost always just reacting,” said curator Bia Junqueira in a released statement. Cesar Augusto added; “In times of moral, civic and religious setbacks, we are proposing a move to look forward, to look toward the coming times and the social, political and cultural clashes.” \nThis year the festival will open with Felipe Hirsch’s presentation of “Puzzle (d)” at Teatro Municipal Carlos Gomes in Centro at 9PM on Friday, October, 9th. Originally created for the 2013 Frankfurt Book Fair, the critically-acclaimed piece examines the international repercussions of Germany’s crash. Following the opening, the piece will be performed again in the same location on October 10th at both 5PM and 9PM. \nOn October 10th and 11th, the Netherlands collective Wunderbaum will present “Looking For Paul” at Oi Futuro Flamengo. The piece examines the controversial life and work of American artist Paul McCarthy.
