Because they no longer have to do their homework.\nAnd they have the permission of their parents.\nAiring on 60 Minutes on Nine tonight, reporter Charles Wooley examines the debate surrounding the pros and cons of giving young children homework.\nAs a homework-hater himself, Wooley told news.com.au not only did he empathise with children who hated doing homework, he supported stopping it.\nHe said he spoke to a number of parents and teachers who have abandoned the practice as well as experts who say the idea isn’t radical thinking — it’s actually backed by research .\n“We spoke to Professor Mike Horsley who said studies from Euope have shown that there is no connection between doing your homework when you’re a little tyke and going on to university or doing better academically,” Wooley said. “In fact if you look at a country like Finland where they don’t do homework until quite late they get a much better school retention rate than Australia.”\nIn the program, the 60 Minutes team meets with Adelaide mum Clare Crew who did away with homework because she could’nt cope with the stress it was creating at home.\n“What Clare was saying was that it was a constant battle with the three children to get the homework done, to get dinner on and try to keep a calm environment while trying to sit the kids down and make them do their homework,” wooley said. “(She said) they ended up in tears, that she was stressed. It ended up a very unhappy environment.\n“And that is my memory of homework - tears. And my mum doing it for me.\n“When we visited them they were happy kids who were out playing and not stuck on the computer doing homework.”\nTeacher Richard Black with students at The Know School in Melbourne. Source: Channel 9\nAnd its not just homes that are getting rid of homework, it’s schools as well.\nThe team visited independent school, The Knox School in Melbourne where teacher Richard Black stopped handing out homework years ago.\n“In the lower school there, they have abandoned homework, and there is a passionate teacher there, Richard Black, who was great,” wooley explained. “He hasn’t set homework for years and the kids love school.\n“He says the kids are much less stressed and much more awake which is about better learning.”\nMs Crew is not the only parent who has stopped homework for her children.\nDr Misty Adoniou, senior lecturer in language and literacy at the University of Canberra, told news.com.au she too banned the practice.\n“I actually went to the school and said to the teachers, ‘When my children don’t return homework, blame me and not them’,” she told news.com.au.\n“I didn’t want my children to be singled out for some kind of different attitude, but my reasoning was that there was no research that learning outcomes would improve with homework.\n“A common argument is ... that maybe (homework) is about developing better discipline. But we don’t have any evidence that’s the case either.\n“It’s a funny thing because if you talk to parents, a vast majority wish that homework wasn’t sent home because it’s just a burden, and if you talk to teachers, a vast majority wish they didn’t have to set the homework because they have to mark it — and let’s face it, half the time it’s being done by parents anyway.\n“You have to wonder how homework became such a standard practice. It must just be a small, loud minority of parents who think if they’re not getting homework then perhaps the school isn’t doing its job correctly.”\nDr Adoniou also said homework could put some kids at an unfair disadvantage, especially those with parents unable to help them with their tasks.\n“That’s not to say they don’t have a loving or caring parent, it’s that they don’t have a parent who has the time, perhaps because of shiftwork, or because they have a parent without the language skills, because of they are second language learners, or because they have a parent who struggled at school themselves and can’t really help them,” she said.\n“Those kids are really disadvantaged. So the only thing that homework can really do is disadvantage some children, because we know it doesn’t actually advantage anybody.”\nDr Adoniou said some schools were changing their approach, such as by encouraging children to read freely after school, or spend time with their families and help with housework.\nBut she said time after school was just as well spent by kids being kids, and letting their imaginations keep them busy.\n“My observation of kids — and I was a primary school teacher for a number of years — is that kids actually do find very entertaining things to do when left to their own resources,” she said.\n“And if I unpack the skills that they’re using as they do these tasks, I think they’re benefiting many more skills than sitting down and doing a dot-to-dot dinosaur with 15 subtractions underneath it.”\nDr Adoniou said parents who didn’t want their children doing homework should know it was harder to stop in secondary school, due to the structure of grading and its reliance on take-home assessments.\nBut she said she would encourage parents to speak up if they wanted a homework-free home.\n“I’ve often told my friends who aren’t in education what I did (about stopping homework) and they said they wouldn’t have the courage to do that. That they wouldn’t have the knowledge, or wouldn’t be clever enough to tell a teacher that, because the assumption is that the teacher probably knows best,” she said.\n“But I would probably encourage parents to go to the teacher and say, the homework you’re sending home isn’t adding any value to our home life and they’re not doing it.\n“You can talk to many parents and they will say that when that homework comes home, it just causes tension and stress in the house. So what is the point of it?”\nSee the full story on 60 Minutes at 8:30pm on Nine tonight.\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6a4be9a63ac02150f0ded86bd4f0865d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/86d994c01ff1d7d29597292ccc1582e5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:57:07.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
