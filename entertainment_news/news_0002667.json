The namig of an ad hoc committee of Valeant board members came as the Canada-based firm said a preliminary internal review had \"confirmed the appropriateness\" of revenue recognition and accounting treatment of company medications processed through the pharmacy, Philidor RX Services.\n\"However, other issues have been raised publicly about Philidor's business practices, and it is appropriate that they be fully reviewed,\" J. Michael Pearson, Valeant's CEO and Chairman, said in a statement with the announcement.\nThe questions surfaced publicly last week, when a report by Citron Research and its executive editor, activist short-seller Andrew Left, alleged that Valeant created \"phantom accounts\" as part of a purported \"fraud to create invoices to deceive the auditors and book revenue.\"\n\"His motivation is the same as someone who runs into a crowded theater to falsely yell fire; he wanted people to run,\" said Pearson, referring to Left during a conference call with investors. \"He intentionally designed the report to frighten our shareholders to drive down the price of the stock so he could make money from his short selling.\"\nResponding in a Bloomberg TV appearance, Left instead said he properly warned about the potential threat. \"It's three days later, investors have had a chance to walk through the theater, see the theater owner's response, and they've actually decided to leave the theater,\" he said.\nThe opposing claims reflected continuing investor uncertainty over Valeant's strategy of using of a network of specialty pharmacies to distribute its medications, as well as the company's limited public disclosures about the relationships and the extent of the drugmaker's financial reliance on the arrangements.\nSeesawing between steeper earlier losses mixed with brief intra-day gains, Valeant's shares were down 0.78% at $115.25 in early afternoon trading.\nThe stock had been down nearly 20% for the year as of Friday, and had dropped 42% over the last month. While much of the recent plunge followed the questions raised about Philidor, Valeant's stock also took a hit from the Oct. 14 disclosure that federal prosecutors in Massachusetts and New York have subpoenaed information about the company's drug pricing and distribution policies.\nUSA TODAY\nValeant shares plunge on negative research report\nDuring the conference call, Pearson reaffirmed the company's forecast of $7.5 billion in 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, except for one-time charges. He and other officials also told Wall Street analysts:\nUse of specialty pharmacies to distribute dermatology medications is common, and has been used by pharmaceutical firms Allergan, Garderma (Nestle) and PharmaDerm (Novartis.) Specialty pharmacies accounted for 7.2% of Valeant's net revenue to date this year, with Philidor accounting for 5.9% of that total. The company also consolidates results for a similar company in Indonesia and one in the United Arab Emirates. Valeant in 2014 decided on a $100 million structured option acquisition of Philidor that gives the drugmaker up to 10 years to acquire the specialty pharmacy for no additional cost. Philidor remains independent in the interim. Valeant officials have not lent money to Philidor's owners, and neither the drugmaker's executives nor board members own a stake in the specialty pharmacy. Medication inventory held at Philidor remains on Valeant's consolidated balance sheet, and revenues are recognized only when the drugs are dispensed to patients. Valeant did not disclose the Philidor relationship until this month's earning's report because the arrangement did not meet the financial threshold to be deemed material for reporting purposes. \"There have been no issues with regards to the accounting or revenue recognition of the business,\" Pearson said during the conference call. \"We have been working with outside counsel, and we have found no evidence of illegal activity whatsoever at Philidor.\"\nHowever, company officials said the special committee would review findings by The Wall Street Journal that Valeant employees who worked at Philidor's Arizona offices went by one name in person and another in email messages. Electronic correspondence from one of the workers carried the name of Peter Parker, the alter ego of Spiderman, the Journal reported.\nCompany officials also answered questions about R&O Pharmacy, a California company that in September sued Valeant over a $69 million payment demand from the the drugmaker. In the lawsuit, R&O denied owing Valeant \"any amount of money.\"\nValeant officials instead characterized the issue as a \"recent collection dispute\" that began after R&O received and paid approximately 75 previous invoices this year.\nPhilidor holds an as-yet unexercised option to acquire Isolani LLC, which in turn holds a 10% equity stake in R&O with the right to acquire the remaining 90%, Valeant officials said.\nThe company said the ad hoc committee examining the Philidor allegations will be chaired by Robert Ingram, Valeant's lead outside director. Other board members on the panel include Norma Provencio, who chairs the audit and risk committee, and Colleen Goggins.\nG. Mason Morfit, a former director who currently is ValueAct Capital's president, will rejoin Valeant's board as an independent member and also serve on the special committee, the company said.\nValeant board members backed Pearson's leadership. \"Mike operates with the highest degree of ethics, and we believe it is important that he and the management team be allowed to focus their efforts on continuing to serve patients and doctors and create long term value for our thousands of individual and institutional shareholders,\" Ingram said in a statement.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce567ca34e1b66f1def2e4c406829446b1bd5872/c=502-0-2502-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810269043051711-AP-Valeant-Pharma-Sprout-Purchase.jpg", "http://www.citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Valeant-Part-II-final-d.pdf", "http://www.valeant.com/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/21/valeant-shares-plunge-negative-research-report/74330120/"], "published": "2015-10-26T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:30:27.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
