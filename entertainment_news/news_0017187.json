They kept asking me, \"Why are you going to Las Vegas?\" … (Initially) I saw that there were seven states that don't have taxes and I saw Nevada. I thought, \"Ooh, Lake Tahoe — pine trees, mountains, beautiful.\" But then an old boyfriend called and said, \"Think about Las Vegas. They have an international airport and that could be good for your career.\" The next day, I got a call from my voice teacher and I told her, \"You're going to think I'm crazy, but I'm thinking about moving to Las Vegas.\" She laughed and said, \"You're not going to believe us, but we just bought property in Las Vegas.\" I thought, there are too many co-inky-dinks.\nReview-Journal: How would you describe the overall cultural life of Las Vegas?\nDeVol: This town is probably the most multifaceted town that exists — including New York. … This is still a very exciting place — still a capital, certainly out west, of entertainment. It's not a town where, like in the old days, it's just the Strip. There are classical organizations … amazing little theaters, theater companies. I think that's really exciting. The dining is unbelievable. … You can eat so fantastically — if you can afford it. It's a great town. And people in general are really, really nice.\nReview-Journal: What's your favorite \"Vegas-y\" activity?\nDeVol: You'll find me at the penny slots at my locals' casino. If I'm trying not to eat late at night, I'll get a skinny vanilla latte and play. And I love Megabucks. One day I'm going to win that million bucks for Opera Las Vegas.\nReview-Journal: What's your favorite un-\"Vegas-y\" activity?\nDeVol: I love Mount Charleston. I love to have lunch out on the terrace — you can take your dog and have a very lovely time. … In Las Vegas, you don't expect the forest, the beautiful trees. It's also a nice change from the heat. The body gets to relax. It's a nice refuge.\nReview-Journal: What's your favorite thing about living in Las Vegas?\nDeVol: I do love the weather. Like all of us Las Vegans, when it's excessively hot, I just grin and bear it. I have a pool, and when you're sitting around in a wet swimsuit, it's tolerable. And I love the long, extended shirtsleeve weather. … After 25 years in Europe, you're so grateful for the warmth.\nGet a taste of tyranny with... Dive into 'Shipwreck!'...
