For the first time on this tour, South Africa were outclassed with both bat and ball by the hosts at Chennai. (Also Read: India vs South Africa 5 th ODI – Top 5 Players to Watch Out For ) Virat Kohli’s return to form will be a huge boost for the Indians. The Delhi batsman had gone through his longest phase without a half-century before scoring a fifty and hundred in consecutive matches. However, he is still far away from his best. His knocks in Rajkot and Chennai were fluent, but didn’t go at the pace in which he would’ve liked. Given India’s misery in the death overs, Kohli would extend his innings till the very end. However, it has been Indian spinners who have caused the most grief to the South African batsmen. Despite getting off to good starts in every match, the Proteas batsmen fail to play the Indian spinners well. They lose wickets and find it tough to get the scoreboard moving. Barring AB de Villiers and JP Duminy, none of their batsmen have countered Indian spinners well.
