The problem is The Metropolitan is not a ballot exempt race for the Caulfield Cup but a race like the Group 3 Naturalism Stakes, held at Caulfield, is.\nThe winner of that race this year was Magnapal, who was subsequently beaten by Escado in the JRA Plate. Escado has since finished seven lengths behind Amralah in the Herbert Power Stakes.\nLloyd Williams elected not to run Amralah in Saturday’s $3 million race but if he had then Sydney Cup winner Grand Marshal would have missed a start. That would have meant the last two Group 1 winners over 2400m or more to come out of Sydney would not be lining up in the Caulfield Cup.\nRacing NSW chief executive Peter V’landys. $3m CAULFIELD CUP\nSaturday, Caulfield\nGroup 1 (2400m)\n1.
