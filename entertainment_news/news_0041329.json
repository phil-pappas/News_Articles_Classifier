More >> \nBy Shelli Weinstein, \nLance Bass has revealed that as a teen in 'N Sync he was sexually harassed by someone who worked with the band. \nThe singer shared his story briefly on The Meredith Vieira Show on Wednesday, as the hosts were discussing Ashley Judd's own revelation that she was once sexually harassed by a studio executive trying to bribe her with movie roles. \n\"It happens to men too,\" he said, sharing that when he was a teen \"there was someone that we worked with that was inappropriately touching us.\" \nHe said that at the time he knew \"that this guy was a pedophile and he was touching me oddly,\" though he didn't feel victimized by the alleged, unnamed offender because he was \"aware of it.\" \nAshley Judd says she was sexually harassed by a studio executive \nDespite the illegal and very personal violation, the star never went to authorities or talked about it much outside of mentioning it to his bandmates. \"With the guys, we would talk about it,\" he said. \"We would kind of joke about it, but it's not a joking thing. But as a kid, it was just odd.\" \nWatch the clip from his interview here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:30:23.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
