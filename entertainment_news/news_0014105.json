It's not easy being a not-for-profit these days.\nSeems like every other day we're hearing warnings about agency doors closing and a tsunami of homeless, aging and/or disabled folks flooding the streets.\nI'm not going for cynicism here. Even some social service leaders admit there's a bit of grandstanding and crying wolf going on.\nStill, there's no question groups that target our most vulnerable are having a rough go of it. The budget mess in Springfield shows no signs of going away any time soon. Adding to the woes: there are more not-for-profits than ever, all vying for the same piece of ever-shrinking pie.\n\"It seems like every other day, we hear of a new one,\" said Eric Ward, executive director of Family Counseling Service. \"This area is saturated with them.\"\nWhich of course, leads to so-called \"donor fatigue\" … at a time when these groups are ailing, as well.\n\"It's a mess,\" said Carole Arliskas, board member for the Compassion Foundation, which raises money for the needy. \"These not-for-profits are scrambling to meet expenses but with funding sources drying up, they've had to cut core programs, as well as staffing.\"\nArliskas says she personally gets three or four appeals a week in her mailbox, and the Compassion Foundation this year got requests from 38 groups seeking grant money …\" the most we've ever seen.\"\nEven CASA Kane County, which is viewed by many as a money-making machine, is down 10 to 15 percent from last year's fundraising total, said Executive Director Gloria Bunce.\nAnd those lower dollars are coming at a time when the need is greater for CASA, which recruits, trains and supports volunteers who advocate through the court system for abused and neglected children. By the end of the year, CASA Kane County will likely have a record-setting 600 kids on its list.\nState budget cuts have a ripple-down effect, unfortunately, as the at-risk population gets hit the hardest, noted Bunce. That, in turn puts more stress on families and more kids end up in the system.\nLikewise, the much smaller CASA Kendall County is seeing more kids and fewer dollars. Only this group is hanging on by a much more tenuous thread. Just recently its board had to let go of Executive Director Chris Goerlich Weber, who was hired in this part-time capacity in 2013 to try and shore up fundraising for the already struggling organization.\nLast year, the Kendall County Board helped keep the group afloat with a $20,000 supplement. But in July, when CASA went to the same well again, this time asking for $40,000. The county balked, citing its own uncertain funding because of Springfield.\nIts annual golf outing went from 80 to 60 participants this year, said CASA Kendall County board president Andrew Smith. When it became obvious the group could not meet payroll through September, leaders made the painful choice to ax one of the two part-time positions. Because the all-volunteer board could more easily pick up the fundraising duties of the executive director — as opposed to the director of advocate services — it made more sense to let the director go, said Smith.\nWith funding down, CASA Kendall County quickly scheduled another couple of fundraisers for the year, including A \"Play for the Kids\" softball tournament in September. Not only did the event raise around $10,000 — comparable to the golf outing — Smith said, \"it drew a new group of donors.\"\nWhich brings up an important point.\nNot-for-profit leaders agree creativity is key to successful fundraising. \"You have to think of different things to do,\" insisted Ward, adding that FCS fundraising has \"held steady over the last few years.\"\n\"If you continue to hold the same old event,\" he said, \"interest starts going down.\"\nIn April, his organization came up with a new idea — a \"Top Chef\" competition that drew some of the best culinary experts from the region and brought in $80,000. As it turned out, Mutual Ground and Breaking Free had a similar idea, with both using a foodie theme for their spring fundraisers.\nLeaders note the importance of seeking out the right people to get through the right doors to help keep their own doors open. There has to be a balance of maintaining old relationships and finding those new donors to keep things going, said Bunce.\nOn their end, donors are also asking for change. While agencies often refer clients to one another because their services are unique, there's plenty of overlap going on — and they are beginning to demand groups become more collaborative.\nThat will be among the topics discussed Oct. 20 at a social services forum called by Elgin Mayor David Kaptain to deal with the budget crisis that has put so many not-for-profits at risk.\nThe community is going to have to pick up the slack, he said, and that means working together, as well as finding alternative sources of fundraising.\nBunce noted donors are also demanding agencies have more strategic plans in place to guarantee sustainability.\n\"They don't want to write a check if they don't think a group will be around for them to see the benefits,\" said Bunce.\nDiversifying revenue sources has become critical. Putting all your eggs in one basket is never a good thing, especially in these tough times, said Michelle Meyers, executive director of Mutual Ground, which relies on state money, grants and fundraising to keep its doors open.\n\"It's a never-ending challenge,\" she said, thankful fundraising for the domestic abuse and sexual assault center in Aurora has held steady the last few years.\nKaren Oswald, executive director of Literacy Connection in Elgin, said its popular Trivia Bee fundraiser had an uptick at its April event after being down previous years — in part, because trivia contests have \"become trendy.\"\nThe bad news: Individual giving is down, and it's becoming harder to figure out how to curb that negative trend. At the same time, \"we can't afford to not figure it out,\" said Oswald. Which is why she's \"listened to more fundraising webinars in the last two months then I did in my entire 18 previous years\" as executive director.\nExperts maintain the bottom line is that the old ways aren't working. \"There has to be fundamental changes in how things are done,\" said Kaptain, hoping the forum he called for in Elgin will bring out board members, staff and volunteers from the 125 organizations that received invitations.\nEric Ward agrees. \"If you are crying every spring that you are going to have to close your doors,\" he said, \"you have to start doing something different.\"\nDcrosby@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616ebbf/turbine/ct-abn-crosby-nonprofit-fundraising-st-1009-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:09:15.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
