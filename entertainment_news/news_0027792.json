Beginning Thursday, however, those who enter the tent will teleport into “Kurios: Cabinet of Curiosities,” a 19th-century steampunk world of unthinkable situations and death-defying characters. \nCirque du Soleil’s 35th touring production has arrived in Costa Mesa for a six-week run through Nov. 29. As with every Cirque show, “Kurios” combines a variety of circus styles and acrobatics with a different theme and storyline. \nBut that’s where the similarities to other shows end, said writer and director Michel Laprise. To avoid presenting something too similar to the other 34 Cirque shows, Laprise pulled the team together to discuss how they could make “Kurios” different. \n“This hasn’t been a project, it’s a mission,” said Laprise, who has worked with the Cirque du Soleil company since 2000. Among many other ventures, Laprise provided artistic direction for Madonna’s 2012 Super Bowl halftime show and directed her MDNA tour. \n“The ‘Kurios’ creative team and I made a list of things we can do; then we went through the list to figure out if we did things out of necessity or habit because we feel comfortable,” Laprise said. “Everything that we found was a habit or out of comfort, we took off the list.” \nLaprise lowered the stage to be only 24 inches high, the lowest of all Cirque shows, so the audience is closer to the artists. He also removed traditional circus acts, such as the trapeze and contortion tables. \n“We play a lot with perception, so things that are normally smaller appear larger and vice versa. So instead of a usual table, contortionists will perform their acts on a mechanical structure that looks like a large human hand,” Laprise said. “We do this to create a feeling that you are in a dreamlike world where things can be different.” \nAs for the Victorian-era steampunk theme, Laprise said the team was searching for an aesthetic that would enhance the show’s theme of curiosity. \n“We quickly agreed steampunk was the way to go, because it was a very creative time where people were creating, living in curiosity and coming out of innovation,” said Laprise. \nThe “Kurios” storyline follows The Seeker, an aging inventor, who believes there is an invisible world within his Cabinet of Curiosities. As the story unfolds, unearthly characters come out of his cabinet to perform out-of-this-world acts. \nFreakish creatures are present, a Cirque norm; however, “Kurios” also integrates ordinary people and objects, elements that Laprise said he wanted so the audience would connect with the characters. \nPerformers dressed in late-19th century fashion will be in normal situations such as sitting and eating dinner, only their chairs are mutilated into strange forms. Props such as gramophones, typewriters, electrical bulbs and turbines will be scattered and used for choreography throughout the set. \n“We want people to see that it is possible to do things differently. So they will recognize a chair in the show, but when they come home, they will see all of the possibilities of what they can do with their chairs,” Laprise said. \nAcrobats, aerialists and contortionists will also play a variety of characters, including strongmen, robotic assistants and conjoined twins. Mini Lili – portrayed by 3-foot-2 Antanina Satsura, who is one of the 10 smallest people in the world – will also play an important role in the world of “Kurios.” \nThe show will present other Cirque firsts, including an opening act with artists on top of the big top welcoming the guests with live music. Select audience members will also have the opportunity to go backstage and cross a rope bridge before the show. \n“Every act uses an element of surprise. We changed up the rhythm and speed of contortion, so we practically rewrote the book on this traditional act,” said Laprise. “When we wrote ‘Kurios,’ we thought, ‘OK, we’ve been doing this for 30 years, how can we surprise the audience? How can we surprise ourselves?’ And we did.” \nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:05:51.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
