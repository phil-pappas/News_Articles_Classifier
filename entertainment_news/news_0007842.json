Hawthorne, the artist who founded the Provincetown art colony, an ocean away from the play’s setting in County Donegal. Hawthorne would tell his painting students: “We must teach ourselves to see the beauty of the ugly, to see the beauty of the commonplace. It is so much greater to make much out of little than to make little out of much.” And that’s what Friel did with “Lughnasa,” a memory play recalling the summer of 1936, when he was 7, growing up in a small cottage in a backward village fictionalized as Ballybeg. His 1992 Tony Award-winning masterpiece takes the poverty and romantic disappointments of his unwed mother and four maiden aunts, transforming them with tenderness, heartbreaking honesty and humor. Friel has sanctified their lives, as it were, creating lasting beauty from their frequently bleak and bitter lot. There’s much of universal significance in the Mundy sisters’ tale, where hope breaks out sporadically – just like the ’30s dance music and Irish folk tunes playing on their newfangled radio, nicknamed “Marconi.” The title refers to the Celtic harvest festival of Lughnasa, where the women loved dancing when they were younger. For a while, at least, they consider donning their best clothes, throwing off their doubts and going again. In the vein of Tennessee Williams’“The Glass Menagerie,”“Dancing at Lughnasa” unfolds from the point of view of a narrator, Michael, who personifies the playwright as an adult. But Friel added a device that heightens the sense that the action occurs in the past, sifted through memory. There’s no young actor to play the boy: Whenever the 7-year-old “appears” in scenes, the other actors just pretend he’s there while Michael, the man, responds with words and facial expressions from the side of the stage. Garry Mitchell is a superb choice for the character. In addition to looking every inch the Irishman in his fisherman’s sweater, he delivers the narrative passages with an authority and depth of feeling worthy of their profound and poetic nature. When responding to events as the young Michael, he keeps his interpretations very real, never succumbing to the temptation to overdo boyish mannerisms. To return to the unlikely wisdom of Hawthorne, the artist also famously said, “Beauty in art is the delicious notes of color one against the other.” And that happens to be a pretty great description of the entire eight-person cast as – under the sensitive direction of Steve Reynolds – they shine individually and collectively. We care deeply for each character while becoming enthralled with all the various interactions that spring to life so naturally within and without their clean and tidy white-washed cottage, beautifully designed by Eventide president Ellis Baker, with Greg Hamm’s lighting heightening the magic. Period costumes are in keeping with the family’s economic situation yet delight the eye with lovely tones of earth and sky that keep shifting in a dance of their own as the actors move about the stage (sometimes in wonderful dances choreographed by Pam Wills). As Kate, the oldest sister and the only one employed outside the home, Cindy Harrington uncovers the warm heart of a woman whose devotion to Catholicism often makes her seem rigid and critical. Janet Geist Moore is terrific as Maggie, the sister who bears the main responsibility for running the household as well as oiling the gears of relationships with her riddles and high-spirited antics. Maggie often sings as she works – and Moore does that, too, clear as a bell. Agnes, played by Cathy Ode, spends much of her time knitting gloves to sell in town. She’s the quietest sister, but not without backbone, and Ode keeps us pondering those still waters. Agnes is also especially close to sister Rose, who remains a girl mentally and emotionally while having a woman’s romantic yearnings. Elizabeth Smythe creates, in Rose, a three-dimensional character. Tara Keirnan gives a sensitive interpretation as Chris, the youngest sister and Michael’s mother, teetering between anxious fears and tentative joy when the boy’s father, Gerry Evans, shows up for one of his rare visits. Jody O’Neil, who plays Gerry, gives a captivating performance as this dance instructor turned gamophone salesman (who – in his latest career move – is about to go off to fight in the Spanish Civil War). We come to see something of why he’s charmed Chris – and how he sparks hopes in the other sisters, too. One other male character’s arrival disrupts the Mundy sisters’ lives in the summer of 1936: Their brother, Michael’s Uncle Jack (Toby Wilson), a priest, returns from many years as a missionary at a leper colony in Uganda. He’s been a source of pride for the family and his village, but arrives homes in a state of mental confusion from malaria – and perhaps more converted by the Africans than they were by him. Wilson does a fine job of moving from befuddled to eccentric. Friel died at 86 on Oct. 2, just two weeks before the show’s opening, making it something of a memorial as well as a memory. During his opening remarks Friday night. Baker noted how news of the playwright’s passing deeply touched the cast and crew. “We took a deep breath and then with renewed energy we went back to work,” he said, calling it an “extraordinary experience.” Falling under the spell of the show’s poignant beauty, Eventide audiences will likely think so, too.
