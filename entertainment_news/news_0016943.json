Saved by the Bell's Lark Voorhies Calls Off Six-Month Marriage 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nJust six months after marrying in Las Vegas, Saved by the Bell 's Lark Voorhies and her husband Jimmy Green are getting a divorce, TMZ reports. \nThe two wed in April after meeting on Facebook just a year earlier. \nGreen reportedly told TMZ that the marriage has been an unhappy one from the beginning. Voorhies previously defended her soon-to-be-ex against her mother, Patricia, who filed a restraining order against Green in July. \nAccording to Patricia's court filing, Green was insistent on sleeping at her home where Voorhies was staying, and was verbally abusive. Patricia claimed that her daughter was living with her because she was \"psychologically, mentally and emotionally fragile.\" \nVoorhies later denied the claim, telling ET that she has \"always been mentally healthy,\" and that Green wasn't taking advantage of her. \"We're selectively together for all the right reasons.\" \nVideo: Lark Voorhies talks new marriage Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:06:21.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
