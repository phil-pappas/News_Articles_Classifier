Smith October 21, 2015 10:36 ET | Source: United Service Organizations (USO) \nWASHINGTON, Oct. 21,   Nearly 1,000 guests gathered at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center at the annual USO Gala to celebrate the men and women of America's military and honor six service members, selected by senior military officials, and two USO volunteers for their extraordinary service. In addition to paying tribute to our men and women in uniform, the night highlighted how the USO helps connect service members with their family, home and country and also recognized supporters of the USO and America's military. Air Force General Paul J. Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided the keynote speech for the evening. Selva discussed the importance of thanking our nation's service members for their dedication throughout their service and for defending our country's freedom and liberty. \"I'm not here as the senior military leader or as an officer in the United States Air Force, but as a citizen of the United States,\" said Selva. \"As a member of the greatest nation in the world that is defended by some of the greatest young men and women humanity has to offer. And to say thank you, not for standing in our shadow but for standing by our side and taking care of us and our families when it's most important\" Since 2003, the USO Congressional Caucus has supported the USO, assembling more than 40,000 care packages at bi-annual service project events and supporting the two USO Warrior and Family Centers at Fort Belvoir and Naval Support Activity Bethesda through regular visits to troops. USO Chairman of the Board General Richard B. Myers presented the Spirit of the USO Award to the USO Congressional Caucus for their enduring support and commitment to our nation's service members and their families. Dr. J.D. Crouch II, USO President and CEO reflected on the USO's commitment to remain by the side of our nation's service members no matter where their home may be. Crouch also discussed how the USO launched the USO Transition 360 Alliance earlier this year to expand the organization's scope of programming for troops and military families transitioning out of the military. \"Tonight is a night of connection, and connection forms the very DNA of this organization,\" said Crouch. \"A central challenge of military life is dealing with the separation that comes with service. The USO is that vital bridge back to family, home and country -- connecting our troops, no matter where, or how long or under what conditions they serve.\" Crouch continued on, discussing the great impact USO volunteers have on service members. With more than 30,000 USO volunteers located around the world, the USO's volunteers are a valuable way for the nonprofit organization to help service members stay connected to home despite how far away they are from loved ones. Crouch awarded the USO Volunteer of the Year Award to one stateside volunteer and one overseas volunteer for their exemplary service. USO Las Vegas's volunteer Richard \"Dick\" Anderson was recognized for his enduring support of the USO and his dedication to recruit new USO volunteers in the Las Vegas area. Eric Chun, who just entered the military and is in basic training, began volunteering at USO Guam at age 15. Chun was recognized for his steadfast and exceptional commitment to the USO's mission. Guests enjoyed a fall-themed dinner designed by USO tour veteran and star of Food Network's Restaurant: Impossible, Chef Robert Irvine. Irvine said he is looking forward to his third USO tour and also shined a light on the impact USO tours have on troops and military families. Grammy Award winning recording artist and best-selling author Michael W. Smith entertained the audience with an old classic, \"Place in this World\" and a special tribute in remembrance of 9/11 and those who have served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Smith also shared his heartfelt gratitude for the service and sacrifice America's military provides. \"I'm a big fan of the USO and it's just an honor to be here,\" said singer/songwriter Michael W. Smith. \"To support and honor the honorees and recipients.\" Actor and USO tour veteran Robert Patrick emceed the evening. Patrick, who has participated in five USO tours and visited more than 8,100 troops and military families, shared with the audience his USO experience. \"They informed me just being there … the [service members] would respond favorably to that,\" said Robert Patrick. \"Just having something that they can link to, like American pop culture. And then you just go there and you spend time with them. You walk around. You talk about their hometowns. Just hang out and have a good time. That's the USO.\" As the night came to a close, Air Force General Paul J. Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff joined USO tour veteran and the reigning Mr. Olympia, Phil 'The Gift' Heath to present the USO Service Member of the Year Awards.
