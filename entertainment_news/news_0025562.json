Bobby Jindal says mass shootings show the need for \"a spiritual revival in this country.\" \nThe Republican presidential candidate told ABC's \"This Week\" that the U.S. doesn't need new gun control laws that would disarm law-abiding citizens. He said what America really needs is \"a renaissance of decency.\" \nJindal cited what he called the \"moral decay\" and lack of respect for life reflected in violent movies, TV shows, song lyrics and video games. He added that the gunman in last week's Oregon college shootings was one of millions of young men without a father in the home to guide them. \nThe Louisiana governor also called for stronger U.S. military action to defeat Islamic State militants. \nSound: \n172-a-14-(Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Republican presidential candidate, in interview)-\"the next tragedy\"-GOP presidential candidate Governor Bobby Jindal says new gun control laws won't stop mass shootings.

He quoted Pope Francis' recent remarks about the arms trade being motived by what Francis called \"money that is drenched in blood.\" \nCupich speculates that the pope's comments could apply to domestic weapons sales as well, and notes that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has consistently called for reasonable regulation of guns. \nMIDEAST-GOD'S FOOT SOLDIERS \nJewish, Muslim groups raise temperature at contested shrine \nJERUSALEM (AP) — Jewish and Muslim grassroots groups, self-declared defenders of their faiths, have played a key role in rising Israeli-Palestinian tensions, stepping up activities at the Jerusalem hilltop revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. \nEach side has accused the other of causing provocations. \nIsrael pins much of the blame on a domestic fundamentalist group, the Islamic Movement, saying it whipped up Palestinian anger with claims that Israel is plotting to take over the Muslim-run site. Those claims, dismissed by Israel as incitement, reflect widespread Palestinian fears fueled by the doubling of Jewish visits to the shrine since 2010. \nBacked by senior Israeli politicians, activists have become more vocal in demanding Jewish prayer rights on the mount. Some call for the site's partition and the rebuilding of the biblical Jewish Temple that once stood there. \nTURKEY-BLAST \nPope laments bombings in Turkey \nVATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has led followers in silent prayer for the victims of what he described as the \"terrible slaughter\" in the Turkish capital. \nThe pope paused for 30 seconds of silent prayer for what he called \"that dear country\" during his traditional Angelus blessing Sunday. He told followers gathered in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican that news of the Ankara bomb attacks that killed 95 people brought \"pain for the numerous dead, pain for the wounded and pain because the attackers hit helpless people who were demonstrating for peace.\" \nThe twin explosions Saturday ripped through a crowd of activists rallying for increased democracy and an end to violence between Kurdish rebels and Turkish security forces. \nThe Turkish government said Kurdish rebels or Islamic State militants were likely responsible, while mourners accused Turkey's president of fomenting violence to gain votes for the ruling party. \nSound: \n124-r-22-(Sound of Pope Francis, in Italian, in St. Peter's Square)--Sound of Pope Francis calling the faithful to join him in prayers for the victims of the deadly blasts in Turkey, asking God to receive the souls of the dead and to comfort those suffering and the relatives.

Sean Killeen says it stands as a secular sign of support without inhibiting other religions. \nThe Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports that Killeen responded Friday to a complaint from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Founder Mikey Weinstein says his foundation represents 72 Marines on the base. \nKilleen said no service members have complained about the sign, but Weinstein argues that's because they fear retribution. His group wants the sign relocated to chapel grounds, taken down or accompanied by other signs bearing messages like \"Goddess Bless\" and \"There is no god to bless ... We have each other.\" \nRELIGIOUS DOCTRINE-LEGISLATION \nTenn. bill seeks to curtail teaching of 'religious doctrine' \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A proposed bill would ban teaching Tennessee public school students \"religious doctrine\" until they're in the 10th grade. \nThe proposal from Republican state Rep. Sheila Butt comes on the heels of complaints from parents in several communities as to what their children are learning in middle school about Islam. U.S. Rep Diane Black, R-Tenn., argues that the teachings border on indoctrination. \nThe Tennessean reports that state education officials acknowledged that students might learn the Five Pillars of Islam or read from religious texts, but said the information is used to provide historical context about the influence Islam has had on regions of the world. \nAccording to the bill, if a religion is mentioned in middle school curriculum, then it is up to the state board of education to make sure \"the reference does not amount to teaching any form of religious doctrine to the students.\" \nSAINT'S BODY \nBody of Italian saint to be displayed at Madison church \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) — The body of an 11-year-old Italian girl who was killed more than a century ago and declared a saint will be on display this week at a Wisconsin church that bears her name. \nMaria Goretti was stabbed in 1902 by a neighbor during a sexual assault. She forgave her attacker on her deathbed and said she hoped she they would be together in heaven. \nIn 1950, the Roman Catholic Church declared Maria Goretti a saint. Starting Friday morning, the body of the young saint is scheduled to be available for public veneration at St. Maria Goretti Catholic Church in Madison for 22 hours. The church will remain open for people to file by her glass-sided casket. \nThe Wisconsin State Journal reports that thousands are expected, with each person limited to 15 seconds in front of her casket. \nAlthough none of her remains will be visible, her wax-encased skeleton is largely complete, according to the Catholic Church. Touching the casket is believed to bring healing. \nANTI-MUSLIM PROTEST PHOENIX \nProtesters gather to hold anti-Islam rally at Phoenix mosque \nPHOENIX (AP) — A campaign to stage demonstrations against Islam across the U.S. has gone largely unheeded, although about 200 protesters gathered in front of the Islamic Community Center in Phoenix on Saturday afternoon. \nKTAR radio reports that Usama Shami, president of the Phoenix mosque, said rally organizers were displaying their bigotry. \nThe organizer of the Phoenix rally, John Ritzheimer, says he's not against Muslims, but against what he calls their ideology which he says leads them to attack people. He led a previous rally at the mosque in May after two of its former congregants were killed when they tried to attack a Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas. \nSaturday's rally in Phoenix appeared to be the largest in response to a nationwide call for protests against Islam in America this past weekend. \nSAUDI-HAJJ \nAP Exclusive: Prince says Saudis will stay in charge of hajj \nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal has rejected the idea of sharing the administration of the annual hajj pilgrimage with other Muslim nations, saying Riyadh considers it \"a matter of sovereignty\" and a \"privilege.\" \nThe senior member of the Saudi royal family spoke to The Associated Press on Sunday as his country faces mounting criticism in the wake of last month's disastrous crush of pilgrims outside the holy city of Mecca, which killed over 1,400 people, according to an AP count, making it the deadliest annual pilgrimage on record. \nSaudi Arabia's rival Iran, which lost the largest number of pilgrims, has accused the kingdom of mismanagement and called for an independent body to oversee the hajj. \nThe royal Al Saud family, which governs Saudi Arabia and for which the country is named, derives enormous prestige and legitimacy from being the caretakers of the hajj and Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina. \nBRITAIN-WITCHCRAFT RISE \nUK police says witchcraft, exorcism cases on rise \nLONDON (AP) — Britain's Metropolitan Police have reported an increase in the number of child abuse cases that involve allegations of witchcraft and exorcism. \nPolice said Sunday a specialist unit received 46 such cases in 2014, more than twice as many as the year before. \nThe \"Project Violet\" unit says 60 incidents have been reported so far this year, continuing the upward trend. \nDetective Sergeant Terry Sharpe said the number of incidents remains \"small in number\" but that \"there has been a significant increase.\" \nHe said in one case a 9-year-old boy was called a \"devil child\" and was thrown out of his home by his parents. Another case involved a mother who believed her son was a witch and tried to bite and smother him. \nINDIA-DALAI LAMA \nThe Dalai Lama says Buddhist culture most important to him \nDHARMSALA, India (AP) — The Dalai Lama says that for him, the most important thing is to preserve the Buddhist culture that has helped the Tibetan people live together, even in exile. He also said he regrets that some people use religion to harm others and said he supports teaching secular values. \nThe 80-year-old Tibetan Buddhist leader made the comments Saturday at his first public meeting since returning to India last week from the U.S., where he underwent a thorough medical checkup. \nMany Tibetans fear that their culture may not endure for long and may weaken after the Dalai Lama is gone. \nDozens of school children in traditional Tibetan costumes welcomed the Dalai Lama, and he looked cheerful as he responded to his followers' greetings. \nBeijing accuses him of seeking to separate Tibet from China. But the Dalai Lama says he simply wants a high degree of Tibetan autonomy under Chinese rule.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:34:34.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
