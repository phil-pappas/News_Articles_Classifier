Russ DeSantis/For The Star Ledger ( ) Comments \nWho knew New Jersey had anything in common with North Dakota? \nThe fourth-smallest state and the state with the fourth-fewest people are the only two states where Sour Patch Kids are the favorite Halloween candy, according to one survey. \nOf the 40,000 people asked nationally by Influenster.com, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups received the most votes . The sweet treat that won the popular vote in the most states was different. Candy Corn got the nod in Oregon, Wyoming, Tenesseee, Texas and South Carolina. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups took the vote in Connecticut and Rhode Island. RELATED: 7 of the most controversial Halloween costumes in recent years \nIn what's undoubtedly a coincidence, Sour Patch Kids are manufactured by East-Hanover based Mondelēz International. That company also makes what is purportedly Pennsylvania's most popular holiday candy — Swedish Fish. New Yorkers went with another non-chocolate choice — Sweet Tarts. \nTake our survey to vote on your favorite candy.
