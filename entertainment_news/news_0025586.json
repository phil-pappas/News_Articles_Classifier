Gonzales | Oct. 11, 2015 at 05:30pm \nSam Milby has only good words for Jennylyn Mercado, his leading lady in the upcoming romantic comedy titled Prenup produced by Regal Entertainment. \n“She is so nice,” he starts. “When you have the chance to work with someone who is not only physically alluring but kind-hearted as well, it’s a great feeling. You find it exciting to report to the set every shooting day, which is my exact experience in our maiden film together.” \nSome kibitzers ask if he doesn’t have any plan of courting Jen especially in the midst of speculations that her relationship with Dennis Trillo has allegedly ended. Jennylyn Mercado and Sam Milby \n“Personally, I don’t want things to appear forcing through if ever since we have a movie to promote. It’s not as easy as that. I’ve always believed in right timing. Maybe, one of these days, it will just happen naturally. Let’s wait and see!” \nSam admits that with Jen, he’s shy. \n“It’s not that I’m too much overwhelmed by her. But yes, I’m shy where getting romantically linked with her off-cam is concerned. Jen is so lovely, kind and has a good heart. Perhaps, it can be attributed to my being basically shy and quiet. But I definitely enjoyed every moment when we were doing this project.” \nThe handsome Kapamilya star knows though that if a guy really wants to pursue someone, he will do everything just to win her by his side. \n“Of course!” avers Sam. “You have to go out of your comfort zone, so to speak to make things happen. As they say, no guts, no glory, right?” \nCuriously, has it ever crossed his mind asking Jen for a date? \n“Well, as I’ve said earlier, she is a beautiful person inside and out. What happened to us in the entirety of Prenup is all work. A date? Why not, especially that the film will get shown soon. But of course, it’s something I won’t announce in public if ever!” \nIt’s been years since he had a love life. His last was with Anne Curtis. Doesn’t he miss having a girlfriend? \nTo be honest, it took time to pick up from my last relationship. There are really people who just enjoy being single at the moment, just like me. I don’t get to meet anybody new since I don’t really go out. I want to leave it at that temporarily.” \nFor his next serious love life, the be-dimpled actor-singer has a wish. \n“Yes! Given the choice, I want someone not from the ‘biz this time. Maybe, it’s more peaceful...less controversies and pressures,” ends Sam. \n*", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:03:00.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
