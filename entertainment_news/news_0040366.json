It also houses the ruins of the Biblical Jewish Temple and is the most sacred site in Judaism. Under long-standing agreements, Jews may visit the site, but must limit any praying activity to the nearby Wailing Wall.\nThe latest surge in violence has been sparked by Palestinian concerns that Israel wants to change the status quo and allow Jewish religious activities on the compound. Israel has denied repeatedly that it is seeking such a change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:33:04.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
