I took a page out of my kid's old elementary school assignment and tweaked it for #Nerdgirl. This week, I'm geeking out about my \"I Dream of Jeannie\"/Cocoa Beach Half Marathon Jeannie bottle medal. I took various pictures of it in different scenarios: at home, on the job and just for fun. \nRace director Mitch Varnes was on board with this project — those who finish the race Oct. 25 will get a medal, too. 'Jeannie' exhibit on display at history center \nAll of my subjects recognized the iconic bottle of the popular '60s TV show, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. \"Jeannie\" herself, actress Barbara Eden, returns to Brevard on Oct. 25, and based on the feedback we're getting, people are stoked about it. Seriously stoked. Varnes is hosting a Jeannie lookalike contest (do you have what it takes?) and has a few surprises for runners and spectators. \nCheck back with FLORIDA TODAY and floridatoday.com for our #IDreamOfJeannie coverage. \nHere are my favorite pics from my little project. \nOn the cleanest part of my desk at work. \nNear Atlantic Avenue in Cocoa Beach Buy Photo \nThe Dinosaur Store in Cocoa Beach Buy Photo \nThe Dinosaur Store in Cocoa Beach (Photo: JENNIFER SANGALANG/FLORIDA TODAY) \nAt FLORIDA TODAY's Pink Lemonade Stand on Oct. 2.
