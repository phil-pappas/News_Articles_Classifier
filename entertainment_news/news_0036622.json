She was so confident and she had elements, but with her own take on it. So we’re trying to have similar elements within our line.” \nNarces brought opulence with intricate embellishments that were featured throughout the line of ladylike looks, steeped in metallics, creams, whites and soft pastels, including lace bodices, feathered fringe skirts and form-flattering bustier-style dresses. \nWirthensohn closed out the showcase with the debut of the label’s bridal line, with a collection of dramatically detailed gowns designed to double as special occasion dresses, including those with fishtail hems, ruching and pleating. \n___ \nNEW LINE, NEW STORE FOR MACKAGE \nThe weeks leading up to the unveiling of Mackage’s latest collection proved to be as eventful as the show itself with the label’s launch of its inaugural Canadian store at Carrefour Laval in Quebec. \n“It’s been on our list for a long time. It’s just we really were developing the international market on the wholesale side,” said co-creative director Eran Elfassy. \n“A turbulent time in Canadian retailer wasn’t a deterrent for the Montreal-based outerwear and accessories brand to proceed with launching its first Canadian storefront. \n“I think that the fact that we sell something people need in Canada it’s not as worrisome as if we were doing summer dresses,” said co-creative director Elisa Dahan. \n“I think everybody needs a good coat here. …. We go through so many different types of climates, there are so many different outerwear pieces you need.” \n“We believe three things you should invest in are your shoes, your handbags and your coats,” added Elfassy. \nWith their spring-summer 2016 collection, the label sought to offer a sense of ease in its collection of “industrial, polished” looks. \nThe women’s collection saw more traditional draped trench coats in sand and navy hues alongside luxurious leathers and suedes drenched in vibrant red and turquoise. The men’s line encompassed puffer vests, anoraks and suede bombers as well as crisp leather moto jackets with studded sleeves. \n___ \nDEE SNIDER ‘TWISTED’ TAKE ON TORONTO STYLE \nTwisted Sister lead singer Dee Singer is calling Toronto home for several months as the rocker prepares to hit the stage for his festive-themed musical. \nIn the meantime, the veteran frontman has been enjoying his time as a front-row Fashion Week spectator. \n“When in Toronto, do as the Torontonians do,” Snider said backstage following the Mackage show wearing a coat from the Montreal-based brand. \n“I’ve got my Blue Jays cap, and I’m checking out what the city has to offer, and Fashion Week is an amazing Toronto-based, Canadian-based event.” \nSnider said his wife, Suzette, is the costume designer for his upcoming stage show and described her as the “fashion-forward one” in their family. \nThat said, he’s been more than impressed by the works of Canadian designers. \n“Being from New York, we live out in L.A., we have a place in Vegas, we travel around the world a lot. And I, for one, like a lot more of the fashions I’m seeing in general here than I’ve seen in other places. \n“For my money, Toronto is one step ahead.” \nSnider will be starring in “Dee Snider’s Rock & Roll Christmas Tale” at Toronto’s Winter Garden Theatre beginning Nov. 17. \nFashion Week continues until Friday. \n— Follow @lauren_larose on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:25:29.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
