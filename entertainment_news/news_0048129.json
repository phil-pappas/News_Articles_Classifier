Unbelievably, his legacy can be recognized more frequently not so much in his fellow actors, but in recording artists. \nMorrissey, who with Johnny Marr ascended to fame as co-founder of the Smiths, became one of the actor's most enthusiastic though unlikely fan. Not only is Morrissey British, unlike his very American subject, but the singer has none of the physical rebellion that the actor represented. \nWhile the Hollywood star relished fast cars, which would result in his untimely death, Morrissey is well-known as a staunch vegetarian and advocate of animal rights. The actor, through films like Rebel without a Cause , became an icon for anti-bookishness. Morrissey, on the other hand, espouses poetry and classic writers like Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats, and John Keats. \nIn spite of these discrepancies, Morrissey dedicated an entire video to his visit to the grave. \"Suede head\" depicts Morrissey in Indiana, as he wanders through the old school, a farm, and several Midwest sites that resemble where the actor spent his childhood. The end of the video shows Morrissey placing a flower on the grave. \nOther artists, both before and since Morriseey, have referenced him in their songs. Here are fifteen of the most well-known of those artists, and the tunes that esteem the movie star who in his prime lost his life sixty years ago. \n\"Style\" by Taylor Swift \nThe pop country queen sings to her man, \"You've got that James Dean daydream look in your eyes.\" \n\"James Dean\" by the Eagles \nDon Henley and Glenn Frey wrote an entire tune about the actor who they claimed was a master of \"sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop.\" \n\"Rock On\" by David Essex \nThe one-hit wonder resuscitated the memory of the star on this chart-topper, nearly twenty years after the fatal accident. \n\"American Pie\" by Don MCLean \nThe singer-songwriter mentions many artists on this classic, including The Beatles, the Byrds, and the Stones. Even before he gets to those icons, McLean sings about \"a code borrowed from James Dean.\" \n\"Jim Dean of Indiana\" by Phil Ochs \nTaking a break from his anti-war songs, the one-time Dylan folk hero penned this musical biography that at times is more about the Winslows who took him in while a youth. \n\"If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn\" by Sleeping with Sirens \nThe longest title on this list manages to pair up two Hollywood greats, even though the latter may be virtually unknown to those of the rock band's generation. \n\"James Dean (I Wanna Know)\" by Daniel Bedingfield \nThis tune was a huge hit in the United Kingdom, where apparently he is the most idolized American actor. \n\"We Didn't Start the Fire\" by Billy Joel \nThe piano man listed hundreds of pop culture names in this smash hit, on which he sandwiches him between Einstein and Davy Crockett. \n\"Jack and Diane\" by John Cougar \nThe male lover in the title \"does his best James Dean\" according to this smash hit from the American Fool album. \n\"Ridin' with James Dean\" by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts \nOf course the Queen of Leather Rock would be in awe of the actor, whom she probably likes even more than her \"Bad Reputation.\" \n\"Vogue\" by Madonna \nThe material girl on this track lists several of her idols, where he follows Garbo, Deitrich, DiMaggio, Monroe and Brando. \n\"Walk on the Wild Side\" by Lou Reed \nThe transgender named Candy, one of several described in this hit from Transformer, \" thought she was James Dean for a day.\" \n\"James Dean\" by the Goo Goo Dolls \nThe same band that scored huge success with \"Slide\" and \"Iris\" show their appreciation for a more well-known subject n this tune. \n\"Mr. James Dean\" by Hilary Duff \nAlthough better known as Disney's Lizzie McGuire , Duff has managed to release some solid music like this track to an appealing character in her life. \n\"James Dean-esque\" by the Crocketts \nThe actor as you can see is mentioned in a many titles, but this is one of the few that actually use the suffix \"esque.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:20:47.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
