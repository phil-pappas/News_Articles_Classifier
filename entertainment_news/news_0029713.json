By BRITTINI RAY Otis J. Brock Elementary took a stand against gun violence Wednesday afternoon at the school’s Day of National Concern Assembly.\nStudents crowded the school’s gym to hear presentations from community leaders and law enforcement officers on how they can help the city in its war against gun violence. Speakers addressed the dangers of guns and told students what to do if they encounter a weapon.\nLaw enforcement officers told children to “stop,” “run away,” and “tell an adult” if they see a gun, rather than touching or handling the weapon.\n“Our job is all about protecting you,” said Julie Tolbert, Savannah-Chatham assistant police chief. “Officers are not just here for the purpose of putting bad guys in jail. Our number one job is public safety. … We don’t want another killing in this city.”\nAt the end of the assembly, students signed a pledge against gun violence.\nJoi Walker, a fifth-grader from Savannah, said she often tells her friends to talk out situations rather than engaging in physical violence — that’s what the school calls “The Brock Way.”\n“Today was very important to me because it’s sad how people will lose their children over guns,” Joi said. “To me, guns are a very harsh weapon. It’s not really necessary. You should use your mind and mouth to speak and talk about it rather than your fists and weapons. People have lives they need to live, and their families are looking forward to have a good life with them. What’s the point of killing and hurting people? You’re being unthoughtful of people who really just care about each other.”\nStudents, some of whom wore purple clothing in support of domestic violence awareness, listened attentively to the speakers. After presentations, they recited, in unison, a pledge against gun violence, led by their classmate, Hezekiah Manning.\nLateshia Bryant, a Savannah native and a member of Mothers of Murdered Sons Savannah, told students about the impact of gun violence on families, alluding to the death of her son, who was killed three years ago.\n“When a person is shot and killed, it not only affects that person that has been shot,” said Bryant, a mother of three. “It affects their whole family. You don’t want anyone to call your mom and say your daughter or son has been shot. How would your mom feel? How would your brothers, sisters, dad, grandparents feel? It affects everyone.”\nForty-five school shootings have taken place in the United States this year, according to U.S. Attorney Edward Tarver, who also spoke at the event along with Savannah Mayor Edna Jackson. Twelve of those have occurred in Georgia, Tarver said.\nIn Savannah, police investigated 198 shootings last year, 35 more than in 2013. The police department also investigated 33 homicides, most of which involved gunfire.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827514.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827510.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827515.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827511.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827514.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827512.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827512.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827510.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827509.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827509.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827515.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827513.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827511.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827513.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:34.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
