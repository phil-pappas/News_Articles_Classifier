Department of Transportation released a draft Bikeshare expansion plan for public feedback. The draft development plan is the first ever for Bikeshare since its creation five years ago.\nD.C. Bikeshare Program experiences growing pains Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images View all 5 photos The 136-page draft plan is full of detailed maps and data analysis, enough to make one’s head swim. The Department of Transportation commissioned an outside transportation planning firm – Foursquare Integrated Transportation Planning – to crunch the numbers in order to provide empirical benchmarks for determining the location of new docking stations.\nAll four Bikeshare system members plan expansions and equipment purchases . But the D.C. Department of Transportation's recent draft plan covers only the District, which represents the largest municipal Bikeshare participant.\nBikeshare started in September 2010. The District of Columbia and Arlington County launched it. Now, the Bikeshare Program is a partnership between the District of Columbia; Montgomery County, Maryland; Arlington County, Virginia; and Alexandria, Virginia.\nIn the intervening five years the system has grown into one of the largest and most popular bike sharing programs in the nation. It is particularly well-used in downtown Washington, D.C. People like C.W. Kelley, a Logan Circle resident, who works in the West End rely on Bikeshare to travel through the downtown area.\n“I use it to get from point A to point B,” Kelley said after rolling up to one of several docking stations near Metro Center. He pays monthly installments for an annual pass and has used Bikeshare since its inception.\nBut getting from point A to point B using Bikeshare requires that those points have docking stations. In part, the draft expansion plan sets the stage for identifying the location of 40 new stations in the District, scheduled to begin arriving before the end of this year, with 99 new stations in the city proposed over the next three years.\nRelying on various data analyses, four broad city goals, and numerous sustainability objectives within each goal, the draft plan proposes a framework for determining Bikeshare expansion locations. But the Department of Transportation seeks public comments, due by November 15, 2015, on the assumptions that underlie that framework, as well as any other feedback about Bikeshare use.\nThe draft plan fits into the City's moveDC long-range transportation plan, which sets a long-term goal of putting 75 percent of District residents and 90 percent of jobs in the District within a one quarter mile walk of a Bikeshare station by the year 2040. MoveDC is a Department of Transportation initiative to develop a coordinated, multi-modal long range transportation plan in the District.\n\"[W]e...hope people appreciate how this plan helps solidify Capital Bikeshare's vital role in the entire District's transportation system well into the future,\" Terry Owens, a District Department of Transportation representative, said in an e-mail.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/after-major-procuring-setback-capital-bikeshare-could-get-new-bikes-this-fall/2015/08/03/49c3f7d8-37c7-11e5-9d0f-7865a67390ee_story.html", "http://www.wemovedc.org/projectinfo.html", "http://www.wemovedc.org/", "http://ddot.dc.gov/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/08/05/a-3-5-million-capital-bikeshare-bike-purchase-explained/", "http://www.foursquareitp.com/", "http://ddot.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddot/page_content/attachments/Draft%20DDOT%20Bikeshare%20Development%20FINAL%20reduced.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-10T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:55:48.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
