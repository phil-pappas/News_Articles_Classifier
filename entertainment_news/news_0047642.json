Recent report from Latino Review suggested that McAdams would play a Night Nurse in the upcoming movie. Back in September, the \" True Detective \" star confirmed that she would be involved in the movie which centers on Doctor Stephen Strange. Rumors said that McAdams would play a major female role in the movie. According to the latest report, the 36-year-old actress won't play Clea, the love interest of Stephen Strange in the comics. Instead, she will reportedly play Christine Palmer, one of the night shift nurses from Marvel's \"Night Nurse.\" What makes fans curious is why McAdams doesn't play Linda Carter, the better known nurse in Marvel universe. Aside from her popularity, Carter is strongly associated with Strange in the comic books. Palmer first appeared in \"Night Nurse\", which was published in 1972. She is a skilled nurse and she is highly compassionate. After she was accepted to work in Metro General Hospital, she left her home and vowed to make a new life without the help of his father. \"Doctor Strange\" stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the title character, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Baron Mordo. The movie about the titular neurosurgeon doctor, who discovers the hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions, will open in U.S. theaters on November 4, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Doctor Strange News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:19:47.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
