Enlarge... \nBelfast — Ed Webster of Harpswell will present an illustrated lecture documenting Sir Ernest Shackleton’s heroic leadership of the 1914–1917 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, also known as the Endurance Expedition, Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 6:30 p.m. in the Abbott Room of Belfast Free Library, 106 High St. The program is free and open to all. \nWebster’s personally narrated PowerPoint lecture chronicling Shackleton’s expedition is illustrated with the actual photographs taken by the team’s official cameraman, famed Australian photographer Frank Hurley. Modern pictures of South Georgia’s spectacular wildlife and on Shackleton’s crossing are by Webster’s Mt. Everest partner Stephen Venables, one of the few current explorers to lead teams across South Georgia. \nShackleton’s infamous Endurance Expedition to Antarctica is one of the most astounding of survival stories, a tale overflowing with almost unbelievable privation. Departing England in 1914, the renowned British explorer and his team aimed to become the first to fully traverse the Antarctic Continent. Then came the unexpected: their ship, the Endurance , became frozen into the pack ice, was crushed by surging ice floes and sank. \nShackleton and his 27 men lived for months on the floating sea ice. When the ice melted, they took to their three lifeboats and set sail toward the nearest land, Elephant Island. As nearly everything possible went wrong, and the frostbite, starvation and sufferings of the men increased, Shackleton, one of the greatest leaders of men in history, somehow held his team together. In the end, not a man was lost. \nTo commemorate the centenary of Shackleton’s Endurance Expedition, New England mountaineer Webster has created this new educational and historical lecture titled Surviving Antarctica. A highly accomplished lecturer, author and photojournalist, Webster has been published worldwide; and has written more 50 magazine articles and five books. These include three editions of his classic guidebook, “Rock Climbs in the White Mountains of New Hampshire,” plus “Climbing in the Magic Islands to the Lofoten Islands of Arctic Norway: and his best-selling Everest years autobiography, “Snow in the Kingdom, My Storm Years on Everest.” \nA veteran of seven Himalayan expeditions and the pioneer of many new rock climbs of extreme difficulty in New England, Colorado and Utah, Webster is one of America’s most well known rock climbers and Himalayan mountaineers. He also is the recipient of the American Alpine Club’s Literary Award; and the David H. Soules Award for saving the life of a fellow climber. \nThis program has been made possible with support from the Friends of the Belfast Free Library, Belmont Boatworks, Coastwise Realty and Bill Ingersoll at Better Homes & Gardens, Masiello.
