Zanes was founding guitarist for punkers The Del Fuegos in the ’80s and he and Petty became friends when Zanes’ band opened for Petty and The Heartbreakers. (Zanes retired from music and went back to school, earning two master’s degrees and a Ph.D. and became a writer.)\nOf Petty and his addiction, Zanes says, “That happens when the pain becomes too much and you live in a world, in a culture, where people have reached in the direction of heroin to stop the pain. He’s a rock ’n’ roller. He had had encounters with people who did heroin, and he hit a point in his life when he did not know what to do with the pain he was feeling.”\nThe 64-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was mostly worried about how his confession would affect people.\n“I am very concerned that talking about this is putting a bad example out there for young people. If anyone is going to think heroin is an option because they know my story of using heroin, I can’t do this,” he told Zanes, who told him, “I think you’re going to come off as a cautionary tale rather than a romantic tale.”\n“Petty: The Biography” will be released Nov. 10.\nDavid Bowie done touring\nEven though David Bowie’s last tour was in 2004, a tour that came to an abrupt halt when the Thin White Duke suffered a heart attack, rumors of him mounting a new tour continue. They probably won’t any longer, according to Variety.\nJohn Giddings, booking agent for the 68-year-old Englishman who has called New York City home for many years, says Bowie will never tour again.\n“Every time I see him now, before I even speak to him, he goes, ‘I’m not touring’ and I say, ‘I’m not asking.’\n“He had decided to retire and, like Phil Collins, you can’t demand these people go out there again and again and again.”\nWhile Bowie apparently won’t be performing, he is still recording. A new British TV series, “The Last Panthers,” is using a new Bowie song, “Blackstar” as its theme. He’s also contributing to the upcoming “SpongeBob SquarePants” musical motion picture as well as to a new musical based on his 1976 Nicolas Roeg-directed cult sci-fi film, “The Man Who Fell to Earth.”\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees named\nAdvertisement\nHere are the nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s next class: Nine Inch Nails, N.W.A, The Smiths, Deep Purple, Janet Jackson, Chic, Steve Miller, Chicago, Chaka Khan, The Spinners, Cheap Trick, The Cars, The J.B.’s (James Brown’s band from 1970 through the early 1980s), Los Lobos and Yes.\nFans can vote for their favorite five choices at www.rollingstone.com/music/news/vote-for-the-2016-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inductees-20151008.\nHowever, everyone is encouraged to vote multiple times. What that means is that if Chaka Khan, The Smiths and The Cars didn’t make the cut the first time you voted but you really wanted them to, you can vote for them the second time around when you vote again.\nPrince plays for Madonna\nAfter Madonna’s concert in St. Paul, Minn., local hero Prince invited her and her dancers and singers to his nearby Paisley Park Studios where he put on a private concert in their honor, reports Minnesota Public Radio. In all, about 30 people were invited to the show that was filled with cover songs from the ’80s as well as Prince’s own music from that decade.\nBob Dylan, TV pitchman\nBob Dylan is not against doing commercials or licensing his songs for commercials. In 2004, he was on screen touting Victoria’s Secret, and last year he appeared on camera in a Chrysler ad that premiered during the Super Bowl. He also did a voice-over narrative for a Cadillac ad.\nThis week, the 74-year-old often-reclusive legend is back on camera pitching for IBM in a spot that sees him conversing with IBM supercomputer Watson that concludes with Dylan saying, “Maybe we should write a song together.”\nJulio Iglesias, Aerosmith are through with Trump\nJulio Iglesias has had enough of Donald Trump, saying “I’ve met (him) three or four times because I’ve played his places (casinos). I think his brain and his heart are not connected right now. It’s not correct, his position.” So, the 72-year-old says, “I will never again play his casinos. I don’t want to hurt the immigrants all over the world, and there are many casinos I can play that aren’t owned by Mr. Trump.”\nEver the immature kindergartner, Trump responded by saying, “Good. I don’t like his voice or his performances anymore, anyhow.” Meanwhile, Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry and singer Steven Tyler demanded that Trump immediately quit using the group’s 1973 smash, “Dream On,” at his presidential rallies. Regardless, thus far, Trump has continued to use it, so lawyers for Tyler, the song’s composer, sent him a formal cease and desist letter that stated that Tyler and the band are prepared to sue Trump if necessary.\nShania Twain cancels shows\nA respiratory infection has forced country queen Shania Twain to cancel four East Coast shows on her North American tour, which she says will be her last, according to a post on her Facebook page. Her physicians put a halt to her first jaunt in 11 years.\nThe announcement reads, “Shania Twain’s doctors have advised her to rest for several days.”\nThe tour picks up again in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, on Sunday Oct. 18.\nOriginal Alice Cooper band’s surprise reunion\nThe 200 fans of bassist Dennis Dunaway who attended the book-signing for his memoir, “Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs! My Adventures in the Alice Cooper Group,” at Good Records in Dallas found themselves in for a real treat.\nAfter the signing, two other original Cooper band members, drummer Neal Smith and guitarist-keyboardist Michael Bruce, joined Dunaway for a panel discussion. Then everyone was told to go out to the parking lot, where they found a stage. The trio played “Caught in a Dream” from 1971’s “Love It to Death” before Cooper’s touring guitarist Ryan Roxie joined them on another gem from 1971, “Be My Lover.”\nThen, the place went bonkers as they unimaginable occurred: Alice himself came up and fronted his old band (the other original guitarist, Glen Buxton, died of pneumonia at age 49 in 1997) on “I’m Eighteen,” “Is It My Body” (both from “Love it to Death”), “No More Mr. Nice Guy” from 1973’s “Billion Dollar Babies,” and 1971’s “Under My Wheels” before ending with “School’s Out” from 1972.\nObit: Billy Joe Royal\nPop and country singer Billy Joe Royal died unexpectedly in his sleep at his home in Morehead City, N.C., according to the Nashville Tennessean.\nRoyal was best known for his 1965 debut 45, “Down in the Boondocks,” that reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 9 in the U.S. His two follow-up singles, “I Knew You When” (another Canadian No. 1) and “I’ve Got to Be Somebody,” each made the Top 40. He scored one final comeback hit in 1969, “Cherry Hill Park,” that was a Top 15 biggie here and in Canada.\nHe made another larger comeback in the late-’80s on the country charts. A countrified remake of Aaron Neville’s 1966 “Tell It Like It Is” and “Till I Can’t Take It Anymore” both went to No. 2 in 1989. In all, he hit the country Top 40 a dozen times from 1985-1991.\nIn recent years, he toured with his longtime friend, B.J. Thomas. In 2007, the pair released an album together, “Going by Daydreams.” In 1988, Royal was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.\nNew releases\nAmong the recently released albums, digital issues, MP3 downloads and box sets is “Hollywood 1972,” from The Allman Brothers Band with Johnny Winter that opens with “Statesboro Blues” and wraps with “Whipping Post,” “Johnny B. Good” (a Winter staple) and Robert Johnson’s “Dust My Broom”; and a 13-track, “Sweet Little Angel: Radio Broadcast 1968,” from The Jeff Beck Group with vocalist Rod Stewart and includes “Jeff’s Boogie,” the Beck Group’s take on his Yardbirds hit “Shapes of Things,” “Beck’s Bolero,” and “I Ain’t Superstitious.”\nA new DVD, “The Glen Campbell’ Goodtime Hour: Christmas Specials,” is taken from the singer’s popular CBS variety and comedy show.\nSteve Smith writes a new classic pop, rock and country music news column every week.
