Photo: Nic Walker \nA pair of glasses, a quick smooth down of a too-fulsome head of hair, and a couple of blobs of mortician's wax behind the ears. That's all it takes to turn actor Drew Forsythe into Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\"That's all I have time for, to tell the truth,\" says Forsythe, who portrays the PM in the latest edition (the 15th) of The Wharf Revue . \"I come off stage after rapping as Christopher Pyne, and then I'm straight back on. There's no time for putting on a wig or anything like that.\"\nThe shortcut to creating a quick-fire Turnbull is in the stance, Forsythe explains. \"I don't look remotely like him, but if you stand with your legs very far apart, that really helps. Did you see him handing out the NRL grand final rings? His legs were so far apart it was almost unnatural.\"\nGetting the hands right is important when trying to imitate the Prime Minister. Photo: Andrew Meares \nYou have to get the hands right, too. \"His hands are always pushing forwards, not in a punchy way, but always strong and positive. That's the image he's trying to convey: forward-thinking, optimistic.\"\nAdvertisement Forsythe wasn't expecting to be playing a prime ministerial Turnbull at all this year. The spill that removed Tony Abbott from the top job occurred after the Revue was written. In fact, it was already up and running, in Canberra.\n\"We wrote the show back in April, after the first challenge didn't come off. We had a number with Malcolm contemplating what he was going to do next,\" Forsythe says. \"It was while I was out shopping that I heard another spill had been called. I had to drop everything, race back to the apartment and rewrite the song for the next show.\"\nSuch is life when you are working on a topical revue. The wheels of government keep turning.\n\"We curse and swear but ultimately it's a favour to us,\" Forsythe says. \"It makes the show look like it has been written that day and gives everything more impact.\"\nThe PM's recent cabinet reshuffle also caused a few headaches. Christopher Pyne went from Education to Industry, Innovation and Science. Not an easy title to scan into a rap number. \"We had Phil Scott doing a George Brandis piece, too, but then he lost the Arts portfolio,\" Forsythe adds. \"It's been a busy few weeks. I hope things are a bit more stable now.\"\nThis year's Wharf Revue , which opens at the Sydney Theatre Company on October 22, sees Forsythe back from a sabbatical of sorts, in which he played the role of Doug Hastings in Baz Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom the Musical .\n\"Phil and Jonathan [Biggins] have both taken a break before and [ Strictly Ballroom ] was an offer I couldn't refuse,\" Forsythe says. \"It was lovely to be directed and not have to worry about other people's performances, or feel the brunt of any criticism of the show. You are just an actor doing a job. And working for Baz was great, even though he was constantly changing things right up to the last moment.\"\nDespite 15 years of the Wharf Revue , it doesn't get easier to create, Forsythe says. \"We're responsible for everything. We write and design the show. After all this time, it's hard to say who does what.\"\nAlready, the team is thinking ahead to next year's show. \"It will be interesting to watch Malcolm's ego emerge,\" Forsythe says. \"That sense of his own importance. As yet, he isn't putting a foot wrong, but when he does, we can capitalise on it.\"\nIn the meantime, Forsythe hopes Turnbull won't lose any more hair. \"Thinning and going grey seems to be thing for politicians who take it seriously,\" Forsythe says. \"They get worn down â€“ though over the last five years, the prime ministers have been in and out of the job so fast we haven't really had a chance to see the impact it has on them.\"\nThe Wharf Revue plays from October 21-December 19 at the Sydney Theatre Company, Wharf 1, Walsh Bay; $48-$65.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:02:08.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
