Patrick Carpenter is the pastor of Holy Assumption of St. Mary Russian Orthodox Church.\nHe says he and two priests from other churches went to dinner Sunday night. When they returned, someone fired paintballs at Carpenter's friends as he went inside to disable a security system so he could let them in.\nThe priest says his friends weren't badly hurt but were shocked by the attack. Carpenter says he doubts the paintball shooter targeted them because they were priests because the visitors were wearing civilian clothes.\nPolice are hoping a witness will come forward to identify the car or the paintball shooter riding inside it.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:23:43.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
