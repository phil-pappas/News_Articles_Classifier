For obvious reasons, the track has drawn comparisons to Lionel Richie's 1983 hit but her long-delayed \"25\" album is a \"make-up record\" as opposed to her famous breakup ballads. The new disc arrives Nov. 20, with a special deluxe edition featuring three bonus tracks at Target stores. And despite taking four years -- \"life\" and having a baby got in the way -- between albums last time, she tells Beats 1's Zane Lowe she's already thinking about her next album: \"I think the next one is probably going to be called 'Adele.' The real me.\"\nCharlotte McKinney just made Carl's Jr. history by being the first model to appear in more than one commercial for the burger chain. The 22-year-old blonde beauty puts her curves on display (again) in a new \"Best Day Ever\" ad promoting the Tex Mex Bacon Thickburger and perks for the video game \"Call of Duty: Black Ops III.\" Her cleavage made waves earlier this year for Carl's Jr. 's too-hot-for-TV Super Bowl ad , and she's not very subtle this time, either, with a joke about a soldier's \"nice package.\" Other bikini-clad spokesbabes for the chain have included Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Heidi Klum -- but all only appeared in one spot.\n\"The Other Guys\" Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg reunite in the first trailer for \"Daddy's Home.\" The new comedy follows stepdad Brad (Ferrell) competing with his kids' jerky biological father for their love and affection, with Linda Cardellini (\"Freaks and Geeks\") caught in the middle. \"Did you just punch me in the face, friend?\" Marky Mark asks his rival at one point. \"Daddy's Home\" hits theaters Dec. 25.\nJustin Bieber is \"Sorry\" (not sorry) for party-rocking in a catchy new song released Thursday. An accompanying music video shows a crew of '90s-dressed ladies busting a move to the track, expected to be one of 18 songs on his next album, \"Purpose.\" TMZ reports \"Sorry\" and its video will be used for a mini-movie about the making of the record; a source adds the song is Biebs' apology for his past misbehavior.\nAnd Slash Film reports Eric Stoltz's \"Back to the Future\" footage may be released someday. The \"Pulp Fiction\" actor was famously replaced by Michael J. Fox after four weeks of filming as Marty McFly in the time travel movie. Writer Bob Gale says the \"BTTF\" team had the \"opportunity to completely destroy\" all video of Stoltz, but saved it \"in a vault\" -- and may \"let it get out there\" for some future anniversary. But not on \"Back to the Future\" Day , which belonged to Fox and Christopher Lloyd:\nMore Buzz:\n» Lamar Odom needs kidney transplant, fans offer their kidneys on Twitter ( TMZ )\n» Brothel owner still wants $75K Lamar Odom owes for hookers ( NY Daily News )\n» Tony Bennett says another Lady Gaga collaboration album coming ( Billboard )\n» Avril Lavigne suffers wardrobe malfunction while out with Ryan Cabrera ( DM )\n» Elton John 'Looking Up' with new song, new T-Bone Burnett album ( RStone )\n» Former 'American Idol' singer Corey Clark now working as Uber driver ( TMZ )\n» CeeLo Green apologizes, 'would love' to return to 'The Voice' ( NY Daily News )\n» Forbes' list of highest-paid comedians doesn't include any women ( E!
