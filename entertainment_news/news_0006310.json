It's great to play and Naomie does it brilliantly.'' \nHe admitted, too, that he couldn't envision himself being friends with a real-life Bond. \nDaniel observed: ''It's one of those things - he's fun at a party but don't stay too late.'' \n'James Bond's Spectre with Jonathan Ross' is due to air on Saturday October 17 on ITV.
