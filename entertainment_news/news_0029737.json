The story is told through Jobs interactions with six central figures in his life: his former marketing chief, Joanna Hoffman; his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan; Apple co-founder and friend Wozniak; former Apple engineer Andy Hertzfeld; former Apple CEO Sculley; and Lisa, the daughter that Jobs refused to acknowledge for many years.

(Photo by Vianney Le ... more Image 15 of 15 ‘Steve Jobs’: Compelling snapshots of a genius jerk 1 / 15 Back to Gallery It’s quite possible that Steve Jobs was a jerk, but it’s hard to imagine he was precisely the kind of jerk that we find in “Steve Jobs.”\nIn this imaginative riff, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin as a kind of three-act play, Jobs is relentlessly unpleasant, unreachable and uninspiring, not a visionary so much as a sleek, nasty businessman. But he’s entertaining. He is always entertaining.\nIn “Steve Jobs,” the screenwriter’s signature is as obvious as in a Preston Sturges or Woody Allen film. The characters all sound exactly like they’re in an Aaron Sorkin movie, ping-ponging wisecracks, pithy observations and casual but devastatingly accurate putdowns, and to say that this is anything less than delightful would be churlish.\nMore Information Steve Jobs\n★★★\nQuick take: Is that all there is?\nIn its 122 minutes, “Steve Jobs” is never a great film, but it never becomes tiresome. When the soundtrack pumps up to tell us that it’s about to end, it leaves the audience wanting more.\nThe film takes place on Jobs’ product launches in 1984, 1988, and 1998, and aside from very brief flashbacks — literally, just a flash here and there — the film stays contained, playing out in real time within each act. Jobs ( Michael Fassbender ) moves restlessly from room to room, steamrolling and threatening people (never charming them), as the important figures from his life turn up, either to get abused, ask favors or tell him off.\nActually, sooner or later everyone gets to do all three. There’s Apple CEO John Sculley ( Jeff Daniels ), trying to put lightning in a bottle as Jobs’ boss; Steve Wozniak ( Seth Rogen ), the technical brain behind the home computer, who tells Jobs that he is tired of being thought of as Ringo when he was really John; and Joanna Hoffman ( Kate Winslet ), his marketing director and the closest thing he has to a friend.\nThe movie tries to locate its heart in Jobs’ relationship with his out-of-wedlock daughter, Lisa (played at different ages by different actresses). He starts off rejecting her and denying his paternity in a callous way, but gradually thaws, at least somewhat.\nActually, the movie does find its way to some emotion through this strain, but Sorkin and Boyle overplay it, by trying to make it the movie’s overarching story, the emblem of its hero’s personal progress over 14 years. They can’t succeed, because there’s neither enough drama nor transformation in the relationship, but also because the audience’s interest is limited. We’d rather know abut the guy who invented the iPod.\nAs Jobs, Fassbender is fine on his terms, as the embodiment of Sorkin’s vision. He’s quick, brilliant and impervious, and the matinee idol looks don’t hurt. Just breezing through the room, his Jobs is an impressive man. What he lacks is the thing that the film probably didn’t need, but that the real Steve Jobs did need and had. Fassbender isn’t endearing. He’s not someone you love in spite of yourself. He’s not boyish and charming.\nAshton Kutcher , playing the same role in a lesser movie (“Jobs” from 2013), had these qualities. He made you understand why people bothered to put up with him. By contrast, people up with Fassbender’s Jobs because he’s boss, or because, like Hoffman, they like him for inexplicable reasons.\nSome of the best scenes take place between Jobs and Wozniak, who are more like McCartney and Lennon than they realize, with each possessing necessary qualities that the other lacks, and each both resenting and loving the other guy for it. Rogen conveys a sweetness of nature and a forgiving awareness of Jobs’ strengths and weaknesses, while Fassbender looks at him as though he were some piece of ungainly but essential equipment best kept under a drape. At one point, in passing, he refers to him as Rain Man.\nBoyle films the proceedings on a slightly grainy stock that gives the movie just the hint of a documentary. There’s propulsion and energy. He takes Sorkin’s script and pumps it with amphetamines.\nIf the movie has a weakness, it’s that it ends too soon. “Steve Jobs” is the second Jobs film to not include its inventor’s great 21st century innovations, the iPod, iPhone and iPad. To be sure, “Steve Jobs” has its own integrity as the story of the young innovator, but it’s a little like making a movie about Thomas Edison and stopping somewhere between the phonograph and the lightbulb.\nRunning time: 122 minutes\nMPAA rating: R (profanity)", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831371/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831378/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831369/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831372/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831368/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831372/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831371/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831379/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831370/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831374/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831378/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831374/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831376/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831369/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831373/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831377/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831367/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831377/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831379/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/71/8793664/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831368/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831375/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831376/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831367/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/71/8793664/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831375/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831373/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/06/8831370/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:53:58.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
