In 1517, Martin Luther , having discovered grace through teaching the book of Romans and becoming upset with the sale of indulgences by Johann Tetzel nailed a list of of clerical abuses (called the ninety-five theses) to the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg on October 31. Thesis 86, which says, “Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus , build the basilica of Saint Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?” gained notice, was translated into German, and was printed by the then modern technology called the printing press. This gained notice by Pope Leo X, who challenged Luther.\nUsed by permission of David Simon Luther gained notoriety, and people began to attend services he led. And as he led services, he began to change portions of the mass because of his study of the book of Romans. He came to believe people were saved by grace, and not by works. This meant that neither the payment of indulgences nor the sacrament of Holy Eucharist could gain entry for any person into heaven. Controversy was brewing, and Martin Luther was summoned to Worms for a trial. And through the trial a split was forged between the Roman Catholic Church and Martin Luther’s followers: a new denomination began.\nOne of the most famous teachings of Martin Luther is that salvation comes through faith alone, and not by works. Eternal life is not earned by good works, but is a gift from God by grace. In an almost predestinarian theology Luther taught that even the concept of salvation must come to man through the Holy Spirit, and not on our own. Salvation delivers us from the curse of original sin and from the power of the devil. Saving faith is the knowledge of, acceptance of, and trust in the promise of the Gospel.\nLutherans baptize children and adults by sprinkling in order to wash away original sin. This practice is linked to ! Peter 3:21, “water is like baptism that now saves you—not the washing of dirt from the body, but the promise made to God from a good conscience. And this is because Jesus Christ was raised from the dead.” Lutherans believe that faith must precede baptism (for it is by faith you are saved and not works), and that a parent’s faith carries over to their infants.\nMartin Luther taught that the Bible was the written Word of God, and the only reliable guide for faith and practice. He held that every passage of Scripture has one straightforward meaning, the literal sense as interpreted by other Scripture. Lutherans confess in the Formula of Concord , \"we receive and embrace with our whole heart the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the pure, clear fountain of Israel.\nLutheran worship is liturgical, some of it written by Martin Luther himself. The central part of this liturgical service is the sacrament of giving of the Eucharist; however, through a belief called sacramental union this observance differs from both Catholic and other Protestant observances. The Catholic Church holds the bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ. Many protestant churches hold Communion is a memorial which brings to mind the life of Christ. Lutherans in a practice called circumlocution say Christ is present and offered under the bread, with the bread, in the bread to communicants. Martin Luther said, “... we do not make Christ's body out of the bread ... Nor do we say that his body comes into existence out of the bread [i.e. impanation]. We say that his body, which long ago was made and came into existence, is present when we say, ‘This is my body.’\"\nToday the Lutheran Church is the third most common protestant denomination in the world. It is made up of many smaller denominations which span theologically from liberal to conservative. In early years Lutheran churches spread from Germany to Scandinavia. This church came to America through immigration and has been shaped through language, immigrant communities and theology.\nThe Missouri Synod began as a community of Germans who emigrated to the United States in 1838 to escape harassment by their neighbors. Martin Stephan, the only clergy on the ship was elected bishop, and led the group to settle in Perry County, Missouri. Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther became the first president of the group, leading the group during a time of turmoil, pastoring several churches, and founding a log cabin college which later became Concordia Theological Seminary.\nDuring the middle years of the twentieth century Lutheran churches talked of unification until a dispute emerged within Concordia Seminary over the use of the historical-critical method for biblical interpretation. Jacob Aall Ottesen Preus convinced members of the Missouri Synod to become more orthodox, drop any plans for a merger and began a new seminary, Concordia Seminary in Exile.\nThe Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church is the second largest denomination and one of the most conservative groups, and although centered in the Midwest has churches in almost every state. The Synod was organized in 1847 by twelve pastors who met in Chicago as the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States. The LCMS is headquartered in Kirkwood, MO, a suburb of St. Louis. There are thirty-six churches in the Charlotte area. One of these churches is New Hope Missions Church on Statesville Road in Mooresville which was started in 2010 as part of its ABLAZE! Initiative which included a plan to start 2,000 new congregations by the year 2017.", "external_links": ["http://lutheranhistory.org/presidents/presidents.html", "https://www.facebook.com/New-Hope-Lutheran-Church-326483446031/", "http://www.lcms.org/", "http://bookofconcord.org/whatisalutheran.php", "http://www.newhopelcms.org/our-denomination/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:23:46.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
