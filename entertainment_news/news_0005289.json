Suresh Kumar qualifies for TAKE Chennai amateur team \nOne house 15 housemates 55 cameras100 days \nBigg Boss premieres on 25 th October at 6 PM and will air every night thereon at 9 PM \nOnly on COLORS Kannada \nBangalore, 21 st October 2015 : Karnataka’s much loved show – Bigg Boss, returns for its third season on COLORS Kannada. Starting October 25 th , 2015 with its grand premiere at 6pm – this show promises wholesome family entertainment with interesting tasks and an emotional connect. The show will yet again be hosted by Super Star Kiccha Sudeep who will exude both charm and his trademark hosting skills, making the contestants at home in the intriguing Bigg Boss House. Produced by Endemol Shine India Pvt. Ltd, this season will witness 15 celebrities from different walks of life, living as one family for 100 days, surrounded by 55 cameras that will capture their every move. \nTalking about the reason of bringing the show back to the channel, Ravish Kumar, EVP Viacom18 and Project Head – COLORS Kannada, COLORS Bangla and COLORS Odiya said, “ Bigg Boss is a show that is the perfect combination of drama and reality making the show a hot topic for dinner table and water-cooler conversations. The 9pm primetime slot allows us to cater to the entertainment needs of the entire family and coupled with the charisma that Sudeep brings to Bigg Boss, the show is sure to strike a chord with viewers.” \nSpeaking about the theme for this season, Parameshwara Gundkal, Business Head of COLORS Kannada says, “ You are going to see an undivided Kannada family at the Bigg Boss house this season. Father, Mother, son, daughter, daughter-in-law, cook, and comedian – the house will have every character imaginable. How they survive the 100 days living together under one roof is the essence of the show. This season however, there is no room for drama – this will not be a controversial Bigg Boss, but an emotional one.” \nThe much loved super star, Kiccha Sudeep , will continue to host the show and talking about his return to the show, he said, “Sometimes, the housemates will feel a little low and at times they will be happy. I will be talking to them every weekend. I like hosting this show because it gives me an opportunity to maintain a balance in the house by pacifying those who are sad and reining in the hyperactive. I assure you that this time too, the show will be highly entertaining.” \nIn Season 3, the Bigg Boss house has transformed into a regular Kannada house, but of course, with the characteristic twists and turns that are involved with the show. What’s more, the show will not be held in Lonavala near Pune as in previous years, but in Bidadi near Bangalore where a palatial 14,000 sq. ft. house is decked and ready to host its housemates. In fact, this is the biggest Bigg Boss house ever seen on Indian television. \nElaborating on the same, Abhishek Rege, Chief Operating Officer – Television, Endemol Shine India, said, “This year too Bigg Boss Kannada will live up to its promise of providing unlimited and un-paralleled entertainment. With our new theme ‘No Room for Drama’ this season, there is no space for controversies and fights but instead the unpredictability and the twists & turns of the show will help churn out a mixed bag of reactions from contestants.” \nAs the tagline “No room for drama” suggests, a lot of groundwork has gone into the selection of the housemates to steer clear of controversies. The housemates have been selected carefully from among achievers in various age groups and backgrounds. The challenge this time is to play the game with a clear conscience and win the coveted prize of 50 lakhs. \nAs an added element for our viewers this season, select audience members will get an opportunity to witness the eviction episode ‘Vaarada Kathe Kicchana Jote’ live. \nThe show opens with an explosive event at 6 pm on October 25, 2015 , following which it will air every night at 9 PM only on COLORS Kannada .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:52:59.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
