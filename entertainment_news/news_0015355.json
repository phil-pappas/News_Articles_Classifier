The Queen of Salsa, shown at right in 2002, died in Fort Lee in 2003 at 77. \n8 p.m. Monday-Friday, Telemundo Buy this photo \nWhat exactly is the wig budget for an 80-part novela exploring the life of Celia Cruz? \nThe only thing more unforgettable than the rich, sonorous voice of the Queen of Salsa was arguably her big, brilliantly colored stage ensembles, set off with Vegas-proportioned headwear. On Tuesday, the Spanish-language network Telemundo began airing \"Celia,\" a fictionalized novella based on the life of the prolific Cuban songstress, spanning from her birth in Havana in 1925 to her death at age 77 in 2003. (She died of a brain tumor in her Fort Lee home.) \nIt includes her performance at the 2002 Latin Grammys, when she performed wearing a towering blue and white wig. Actress Aymee Nuyiola, who plays Cruz in her later years, appears in a flashback within the first three minutes of the series dressed in one of Cruz's most well-known costumes. The resemblance is stunning. Though Nuyiola is a Latin Grammy-nominated recording artist, she does not sing in the series. A sound-alike singer was hired to record Cruz's repertoire because licensing her music would have been too expensive. \nThe series offers one vivid glimpse after another of mid-century Cuba as it weaves the story of Cruz's life through the conventions of the telenovela. Not only do we see Cruz at age 77 in the first three minutes, she gets visited by the ghost of her mother while onstage at the Latin Grammys. As foreshadowing goes, the message \"Celia's gonna die soon!\" doesn't get much clearer. \nA common problem with biopics is their tendency to flatten the very people whose stories they aim to tell, especially when filmmakers attempt to squeeze an entire lifetime into two hours. \"Celia\" has the luxury of 80 hours of programming to explore the nuances of the late singer's life, to go down rabbit holes and possibly follow details that otherwise would have been glossed over or ignored. It's the ultimate deep-dive. \nStill, \"Celia\" doesn't avoid all biopic traps. There's a great deal of exposition just to establish the main players in the story. \"Celia\" depicts the roadblocks Cruz faced as a black Cuban head on. When she wants to enter a singing competition, the organizer tells her \"you don't meet the requirements\" because she is mulatta. In another scene, a man coldly brushes past Celia as she offers a friendly hello. \"I don't speak to black people,\" he tells her. The characters bear the familiar, cozily arch exaggerations typical of telenovelas. \nNory is Celia's vindictive, fair-skinned half-sister who is considered the more attractive of the two but lacks Celia's vocal skills. She's constantly setting traps aimed at humiliating Celia that almost always backfire. The root of the sibling rivalry lies in the fact that their father, Simón Cruz (Moises Angulo), doesn't believe Nory is his daughter, so he dotes on Celia. Unfortunately, he also reserves his repressive and strict rules for Celia, too. \nSimón is a tempestuous hypocrite who's deeply invested in protecting Celia's virtue as he reserves the right to philander. One minute Simón is cheating on his wife with a carnival performer and the next he's telling the woman, still standing topless before him, that she's a tramp. \nWe're also introduced to Pedro Knight (Modesto Lacen), the La Sonora trumpet player who spends more time chasing women than he does playing music. When he first appears, Pedro is smooth-talking one woman and arranging a date with her as he's on his way to an afternoon assignation with her mom. \nJeimy Osorio plays young Celia as a gawky, graceless ingenue who desperately wants to be a singer, which makes it pretty easy to see where the story is going by the end of the first episode even if you don't know the broad strokes of Cruz's life. La Sonora's lead singer will be leaving soon to have a baby, creating an opportunity for Celia. \nPedro is going to have to give up his womanizing to be with the Good Girl, and of course, he does. In real life, Knight and Cruz were married for 41 years until her death in 2003, and Knight was Cruz's devoted manager. \nOn the whole, the production is a loving tribute to La Reina de Salsa that appears to have been dusted with a helping of her trademark azúcar. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:48:35.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
