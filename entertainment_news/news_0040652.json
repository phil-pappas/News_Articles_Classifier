LOUIS — Jaime Garcia said he had been dealing with a stomach virus for a couple of days, even losing sleep over the problem, before he took the mound in Game 2 of the National League Division Series against the Cubs.\nThe left-hander told the Cardinals of the issue about an hour before the game, but he was determined to make his first postseason appearance since 2012.\n\"It was my game,\" he said. \"I prepared and worked so hard all year for this situation.\"\nThat work unraveled quickly in the second inning when Garcia's mental lapse sparked the Cubs' five-run spurt in a 6-3 victory to even the series at Busch Stadium. Afterward, Garcia admitted the illness might have made it difficult to focus.\n\"I hate to make excuses, but it's a little tough dealing with what I'm dealing with,\" Garcia said. \"But everybody goes through things. You have to battle and compete through things. I have to be able to do a better job next time.\"\nAustin Jackson reached third base with one out after Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong's throwing error and a stolen base, which Garcia said he should have done a better job at trying to prevent.\nGarcia then fielded Kyle Hendricks' bunt and thought about trying to get a double play at second before realizing Jackson was scoring from third. It was too late, and Garcia then made an off-balance throw into right field, allowing Cubs runners to advance to second and third.\nKyle Hendricks on his Game 2 start Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks talks about his performance in his Game Two start.\nCubs starter Kyle Hendricks talks about his performance in his Game Two start.\nSee more videos \"That's a well-executed bunt, and the pitcher has to be aggressively thinking right out of the box if you're going to have any chance at home,\" Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. \"So then at the last minute there's a lot of noise. I'm sure (catcher Yadier Molina) at that point was calling for him to at least look at home, and it was too late.\"\nBefore long, Garcia had given up five unearned runs in the inning, including a two-run homer to Jorge Soler. Lance Lynn replaced him to start the third, not because of the stomach issue but because of the Cardinals' situation in the game, Matheny said.\nMatheny said Garcia had assured them he was fine to pitch, and they hadn't seen anything that indicated otherwise.\n\"I don't care what's going on, what distractions I have going on, I'm going to compete until they take the ball out of my hand,\" Garcia said. \"Unfortunately that second inning, a couple of things I didn't handle the best way.\"\nThe result is the Cardinals are now under pressure as they travel to Wrigley Field for two games, the first of which is against Jake Arrieta, who is 2-1 with a 2.42 ERA against them in four first-half starts this year.\n\"He's their best pitcher, but at the same time, we're very confident in what we have,\" Garcia said. \"We have trust in ourselves.\"\nckane@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribKane\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Jaime Garcia St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs Austin Jackson National League Lance Lynn", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619d13a/turbine/ct-kyle-hendricks-20151010", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619d5bc/turbine/ct-jaime-garcia-side-cardinals-cubs-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:06:58.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
