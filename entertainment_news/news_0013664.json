We think we know who will take 007's 'licence to kill' from Daniel Craig... Rumours have been circulating about who will be next to take on the role, but we've crunched the numbers... Who will follow in Daniel's footsteps? Many men have been linked with the role... \nThe name's Bond. James Bond. \nIt's a quote many of us have grown up with, as have our parents and even their parents before them. \nEveryone's favourite MI6 Agent has spanned generations, played by such iconic actors as Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. \nAnd although technically we've been watching the same character on screen for over 50 years, each of the seven men who have played him has brought something different to Ian Fleming's character. \nHeartthrob Daniel Craig is currently in possession of the 'licence to kill' and, luckily for us, he will be returning to our screens in October 26 in the new film, Spectre. Daniel Craig as James Bond in Skyfall \nHe's a popular 007, but who will be the next actor to take on the challenge? \nWho would you like to see order his martini 'shaken, not stirred'? \nThere have been rumours and speculation, but it's anyone's game. So we thought we'd crunch some numbers in an attempt to estimate who will follow in Craig's footsteps. \nWho has been tipped to play Bond so far? \nActors who have been named in 007 speculation include Michael Fassbender, Bradley Cooper, Jason Statham, Benedict Cumberbatch, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Damian Lewis, and even David Beckham. \nWhich ones are the bookies backing? \nAs it stands on the William Hill website*, Tom Hardy is currently the bookies' favourite to follow in Daniel Craig's footsteps at 5/2 odds. \nClose behind him is Homeland actor Damien Lewis , who would be the first redhead to play Bond, at 11/4. 1 / 11 Eddie Redmayne won the Oscar for Performance by an Actor in a Leading role for his portrayal of Prof Stephen Hawking in the Theory of Everything \nLuther actor Idris Elba , who also famously took on the role of Nelson Mandela, is next with 4/1 odds, while former Superman Henry Cavill is on 5/1. \nOther actors in the mix include Michael Fassbender (7/1), Nicholas Hoult (10/1), Aiden Turner (20/1), Orlando Bloom (20/1), Eddie Redmayne (25/1) and Jamie Dornan (33/1). \nWhat is the average age of Bond actors? \nTaking into account the ages of all the actors who have previous played James Bond in the film series, we can work out that the average age an actor is when he takes on the role is... \n40 \nNow we've established an average age, perhaps we can eliminate some of the competition. \nThe more baby-faced actors of the group might not get a look-in when it comes to playing 007, who traditionally is played by an older gent. \nThis means that Eddie Redmayne and Jamie Dornan, both 33, along with Aiden Turner and Henry Cavill, who are both 32, are out of the game. \nNicholas Hoult is even younger at 25 - and probably wouldn't be able to convincingly sell a character who's had years of experience as an MI6 agent. \nSo, who's still in the game? \nTom Hardy, Orlando Bloom and Michael Fassbender, all aged 38, are definitely in the running on the younger end of the spectrum. \nMeanwhile, Idris Elba, 43 and 44-year-old Damian Lewis would make more mature Bonds. \nBut which of them is the most popular? \nUsing Google Trends, we can map which actor is searched for the most in Google. \nThis map shows a period from January 2010 to the present day. \nTom Hardy, represented by the red line, has clearly been the most popular when it comes to Google search. He has had several peaks in the last few years. \nOrlando Bloom, in yellow, is the only other actor to have had a noticeable peak - but that was probably down to his now infamous 'brawl' with Justin Bieber. \nIf we narrow down the search period to 2015 alone, we can see that Tom Hardy is by far the most Googled of all the actors. \nPoor Damien Lewis (represented by the green line) is trailing behind, while Idris, Michael and Orlando have roughly the same search volume. \nWho is the biggest hunk? \nBond is a notorious ladies' man and has always been played by conventionally attractive actors - and charmers. \nHave any of our final five made any 'sexiest men' lists? \nTom Hardy ranks 18th in the world on MTV's '50 sexiest men alive', which is pretty good going. Hardy has performed the best in the hunk stakes \nOrlando Bloom is trailing behind him in 28th place, but sadly none of the others have made the list. \nWho has won the most awards? \nBack to the acting talent... We searched the actors' names to find out how many awards they had each won. \nDamian Lewis has won three awards, including an Emmy and a Golden Globe award for his role as Sergeant Nicholas Brody in Homeland. \nIdris Elba also has three, and he too is the proud owner of a Golden Globe, which he won in 2012 for his performance in Luther. Fassbender is playing Shakespeare's Macbeth in the new film - ex-bond Timothy Dalton used to act with RSC \nMichael Fassbender has won more, with 10 under his belt, including a Screen Actors Guild Award for his role in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds and an Empire award for his performance in 12 Years a Slave . \nOrlando Bloom also has 10 awards on his mantelpiece, including a Critics' Choice award for Best Acting performance as Legolas in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. \nMeanwhile, Tom Hardy has three awards - including a BAFTA Rising Star Award just four years ago in 2011. He has since starred in Hollywood blockbusters, including playing Batman villain Bane in the film The Dark Knight Rises. \nAnd the next Bond will be... Tom Hardy Congratulations, Tom! Based on our calculations, Hardy is set to pick up his 007 badge as soon as Daniel Craig is done with it. He's the bookies' favourite, the appropriate age, has the most people interested in him online and he's ranked as one of the sexiest men alive. We can certainly see why...
