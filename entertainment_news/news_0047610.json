I don't even have a backpack,\" said Larry David as he played Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders . \nTracy Morgan made a triumphant return to the \"Saturday Night Live\" stage, more than a year after the former cast member suffered serious injuries from a bus accident. \nAnd, of course, Morgan brought back some of the classics with the help of a camel: \n\"No. I'm Brian Fellows !\" he said. \nDemi Lovato was the show's musical guest, performing \"Stone Cold\" and a mashup of \"Cool for the Summer\" and \"Confident.\" \nAnd \"SNL\" returns Nov. 7 with GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump will host just months after NBC disassociated itself from him. \n\"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people,\" Donald Trump said . \nThings should be interesting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:01:14.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
