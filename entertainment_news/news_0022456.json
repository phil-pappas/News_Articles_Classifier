The former Baywatch star is accused of stabbing an unidentified female when she allegedly tried to stop him from taking her boyfriend's car from outside her home in Los Angeles in August. Jackson left the scene after the alleged altercation, and police officers subsequently arrested him at a hotel. He has been hit with felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon and making criminal threats, according to TMZ.com . The 34 year old could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. The arrest is the latest legal trouble for the actor following a previous arrest earlier this year when he was accused of attacking a man at a hotel in April.
