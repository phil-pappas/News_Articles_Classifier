He said Pakistan supports a “comprehensive reform” of the United Nations, including that of the Security Council but stressed that the Council needs to be “more democratic, representative, accountable and transparent”.

Not a Council, which is an expanded club of the powerful and privileged,” he said. On peacekeeping, Sharif said Pakistan is proud of its historic and current role as a major troop contributor. “We regard it as our obligation to uphold international peace and security,” he said. \nOn climate change, he said when nations meet later this year in Paris for the climate change summit, they will need to respond with common but differentiated responsibility to the threat posed by climate change. ”Partisan interests must not stand in the way of an ambitious and collective commitment to halt and reverse the damage done to our planet,” Sharif added. \nModified Date: October 1, 2015 12:52 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:23:46.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
