The screening lectures will take place in the auditorium of the Hutchinson Center, 80 Belmont Ave./Route 3. \n“La Belle Helene” by Jacques Offenbach, a delightful operatic farce loosely built on the legend of Helen of Troy, will be shown Saturday, Oct. 24, from 12:30 to 4 p.m. In general, the 19th century showed little interest in Greek mythology, but Offenbach effectively used these stories to satirize the political affairs of France at the time of Napoleon III. \nThe third and final opera in this series, “Oedipus Rex” by Igor Stravinsky, will be shown Saturday, Nov. 7, from 12:30 to 3 p.m. The work marks the beginning of Stravinsky’s neo-classical period after “The Rite of Spring.” \nInstructor Brown earned his bachelor’s degree in music education from Boston University and his master’s degree in music history and theory from the University of Connecticut. In his career, he has directed musical theater productions including many of Broadway’s best-known musicals. In addition, he has instructed music courses at the American International College and UMaine’s Hutchinson Center. \nFor more information or to request a disability accommodation, contact Kim Raymond at 338-8034 or kim.raymond@maine.edu. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
