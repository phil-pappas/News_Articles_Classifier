Geelong Show administration events assistant Justine Chisholm tests the Extreme ride, which reaches speeds of 170kmh. Picture: Alison Wynd Source: News Limited \nLADIES and gentlemen, it’s show time — and this year’s Royal Geelong Show is promising to be “bigger and better once again”. \nThe Geelong Showgrounds on Breakwater Rd are already abuzz with activity ahead of the official show dates from Thursday, October 15 to Sunday, October 18. \nThis year’s event will feature all the rides, food and animal competitions we’ve come to expect, with a host of fresh surprises such as acrobatic performances from Cirque Africa and a travelling fishing show complete with it’s own fishpond. \nRoyal Geelong Agricultural and Pastoral Society events assistant Justine Chisholm usually spends the busy days leading up to the show working in administration, but we at the Geelong Advertiser thought she deserved a chance to test the rides out first-hand. \nThe Avenger will be one of the new rides towering over the Showgrounds on Thursday. \n“It’s three minutes of hell,” Ms Chisholm said, in the most enthusiastic possible way. \nShe said ticket sales were “ramping up” ahead of the big first day, and interest was swelling — the team has already received more than 3500 horse entries for the agricultural show. \n“That’s massive,” Ms Chisholm said. \nThere’s going to be a bit of everything for everyone — no matter your tastes — including monster trucks, fireworks, animal shows, gardening and cooking demonstrations, and more than 200 different showbags. \n“We’ve got lots,” Ms Chisholm said. “And our prices are certainly cheaper than the Melbourne Show.” \nHead to royalgeelongshow.com.au to reserve your tickets for this year’s whip cracking, tractor pulling, fairy floss gobbling event, or try your luck and pay at the gate on the day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:24:23.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
