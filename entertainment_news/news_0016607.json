This device gives people the ability to read in high resolution 300 PPI and craft their own reading experience, via Android. Michael Kozlowski of Good e-Reader said, \"When we set out to design the Ultimate e-reader, we wanted to employ Google Android Marshmallow in order to give users the ability to craft their own digital reading experience. All of the major e-readers on the market lock you into a specific ecosystem and make it very difficult to do business with other companies. Our device will let you easily use your favorite e-reading app such as Moon + Reader, Kindle, Kobo, Nook and thousands of others.\"\nThe Ultimate e-reader will be the first device ever to have an Android App Store loaded on the device when it is shipped out to backers. It is the first App Store that is truly optimized for e-ink devices. There is a vast library of 38,000 Android apps that allow a user to install their own screensaver, wallpaper, play casual games, send email and read manga, library books, PDF Files and e-books.\nAmazon, Barnes and Noble, Kobo and hundreds of other companies lock users into their own little walled gardens. The Ultimate e-Reader embraces flexibility and freedom. Freedom to dictate a users own experience, without having to settle for good enough.\nPeter Carotenuto of Good e-Reader said \"People often have to settle for an e-reader that gets the job done, instead of something they truly want to buy. Every day someone emails Good e-Reader imploring us to launch a crowd funded campaign to design and manufacture the perfect e-reader. We have finally listened and are making an e-reader for the people.\"\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ultimate-e-reader/", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWVnb2dvLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0cy90aGUtdWx0aW1hdGUtZS1yZWFkZXIv", "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ultimate-e-reader/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:19:15.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
