The 49-year-old sister of pop legend Michael Jackson recently released her first album since 2008.\nArtists are eligible 25 years after the release of their first record for induction into the Hall of Fame, which was established in 1983.\nMore than 800 artists, music industry professionals and historians will decide who will be inducted. Fans will also be able to cast their votes.\nThe top five artists selected by the public will comprise a \"fans' ballot\" that will be counted along with the other ballots to select the 2016 inductees.\nInductees are ultimately represented in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland which features exhibits, educational programs, a library and archives.\nThe Hall of Fame will announce its choices in December and they will be inducted at a ceremony in New York on April 8.\n(Reporting by Chris Michaud; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:51:49.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
