READ MORE: Danny Dyer Hilariously Hits Back At 'Fans' On Twitter Over Straight To DVD Films \nThe actor has said that when he and his long-term partner Joanne Mas fight he often uses a touching or witty one-liner to put a smile back on her face… although if she gets a sense of déjà vu when she hears them, it’s probably because they’re lifted straight from ‘EastEnders’. \nDanny Dyer \nHowever, it sounds as though it isn’t just ‘EastEnders’ quotes that Danny treats Joanne to. \nHe adds: \"Sometimes I can be quite distant from my missus. Maybe we haven’t been physical in a while and I’ll say stuff like, ‘Your potential kiss has got my mind and body aching’. \n“Now that’s a line from the song Unfinished Sympathy, by Massive Attack. It’s a beautiful little line and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with using it because I’ve heard it and it makes me think of Jo. \n“All right, you might think it’s a bit naughty because I’m making out it’s come from my nut. But it has a truth about it.” \nDanny Dyer and Joanne Mas \nAnd they say romance is dead, eh? We can only hope one day we’ll have a soap actor of our very own to recite Massive Attack lyrics and soap quotes to us. \nEarlier this year, Danny and Joanne announced that, after two decades together, they were finally planning to tie the knot. \nDanny’s autobiography, ‘Life Lessons From The East End’, goes on sale on 22 October.
