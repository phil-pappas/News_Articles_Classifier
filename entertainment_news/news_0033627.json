His estranged wife Khloe has been by his bedside (Evan Agostini/AP) \nA person close to Khloe Kardashian also said he was able to greet his estranged wife. \nIt is the first significant update to Odom’s health since he was found unconscious at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, on Tuesday afternoon. \nAuthorities are still retracing Odom’s 75,000-dollar (£50,000), three-day visit to the legal brothel that started on Saturday afternoon, with blood test results to determine what caused his medical episode still pending. Lamar had been staying at the Love Ranch in Nevada (Chris Carlson/AP) \nThe brothel’s owner and spokesman have said the NBA star chose two women to accompany him in a VIP suite on his first visit to the ranch. \nOdom had said that he had done cocaine before his arrival, and the brothel said they saw him drink alcohol and take as many as 10 supplements sold as “herbal Viagra”. One brand he is believed to have taken was the subject of a 2013 warning from the Food and Drug Administration, which said the pill contained sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. Promoted stories \nThe brothel also said he became upset on Sunday following a phone call where his ex’s Keeping Up With The Kardashians show was mentioned. But he was generally in a good mood, even suggesting that he stay an entire week at the brothel in the rural community. The entrance to the brothel (Chris Carlson/AP) \nOdom was found unconscious on Tuesday with white and reddish substances coming from his nose and mouth. He was breathing and taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Centre in Las Vegas. \nKardashian rushed to his side that night and since then, friends, teammates and loved ones have visited and posted messages on social media asking for prayers. On Wednesday, the Rev Jesse Jackson visited and said Odom was on life support. \nFormer Rhode Island basketball coach Jim Harrick said Odom is in “much improved” condition.
