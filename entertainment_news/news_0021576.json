Friday the 13th: The Game is a third-person, asymmetrical multiplayer title with one person in charge of Jason and seven others controlling the camp councillors trying to escape from Camp Crystal Lake.As Jason, you can act out nightmare-inducing murders and, rather disturbingly, the Kickstarter page described examples in detail.\"Grab a counsellor in a choke hold, pick them up off the ground, and smash their face into a tree. Repeatedly. \"Or how about lifting a counsellor up above your head as they kick and scream, holding them aloft long enough to walk near a rack of farm spikes to slam your victim down upon them?\"The game is currently almost at $115K of its $700K target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:58:24.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
