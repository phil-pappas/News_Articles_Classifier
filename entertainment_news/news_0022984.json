He only regained consciousness from a medically induced coma on Friday to ask to see his children.\nOver the weekend, the good news came pouring in from the unscrupulous twits leaking information to reporters. On Saturday Odom was \" way, way better ,” speaking and breathing without the help of a tube. On Sunday, the reports got even more positive. Not only was his breathing, vision and speech improving, but he had already started physical therapy .\nThe latest update comes in the form of a statement from Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer: \"Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery.\"\nWhile Odom's condition is clearly moving in the right direction, his long term prognosis remains something of a mystery. His lungs and kidneys still require treatment, according to reports, and their condition is still a major concern to doctors. Brain damage is also still a possibility given all the drugs in his system. TMZ reports that doctors believe \"an undetermined amount of damage to his body will be permanent.\" The site adds that \"physical, speech, and other therapists working with him for the foreseeable future.\"\nStill, given that Odom's condition looked grim last week, this is a major relief to fans across the country. The player's had a long, tortured life , but if he can survive his bast struggles, here's hoping he can come out on top this time as well.", "external_links": ["http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20151018/lamar-odom-in-early-stages-of-physical-therapy", "http://www.newsweek.com/former-nba-star-lamar-odom-gaining-strength-after-hospitalization-says-family-384871", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/19/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian-survive-rehab/#ixzz3p2idZz15"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:27:32.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
