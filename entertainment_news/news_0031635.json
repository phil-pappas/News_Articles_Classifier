There he stands in the Accademia in Florence, staring down Goliath, his slender body tensed for the coming battle with a giant.\nThere’s much more to David — bare-knuckled politician, progenitor of an unruly dynasty, poet, composer, author of many of the Psalms — than the role of legendary warrior who lived nearly a millennium before Christ. It’s believed that he was also an ancestor of Jesus, not to mention a wife-stealer, a polygamist and, on the battlefield, as brutal as Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan. You opposed him at your peril. He might weep for you, as he did so famously for his own rebellious son, Absalom, but only after you were dead.\nIt’s this David — gifted artist, vainglorious alpha male, conflicted husband and father — that we meet in The Secret Chord , the beautiful, subtle, grave new novel by Geraldine Brooks. For Brooks, a former journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize for March (2005), David is interesting not for his status as the most beautiful man in art history but, rather, for his matrix of contradictions, his prodigious talents at least balanced, if not nullified, by his instinct for self-gratification.\nThis he sometimes pursues, in The Secret Chord , with a vengeance, often at the expense of others. Brooks introduces him to us as a middle-aged and rather petulant tyrant, fuming in his chambers after the calamity of having his own life saved in battle. Why? Because it made him appear weak in the eyes of his men, or so he complains. To his adviser and historian, Natan (better known as Nathan), he gripes that his nephew, who had thrown himself between David and the spear meant to kill him, has shown him up. “I wanted to strike him dead,” the bitter king tells Natan. “I wanted to grasp the end of that shattered staff and plunge it through his side.”\nA little gratitude wouldn’t hurt, don’t you think? But no. What matters most to David, it seems for much of The Secret Chord , is his grip on power and the tools necessary to maintain it. In this telling, he is the Bible’s ultimate Machiavellian — “what is necessary” is his pragmatic motto — whose softer impulses, including the sorrow he feels in the wake of his own harshest decisions, are subsumed by his iron will to conquer and control.\nAuthor Geraldine Brooks. (Photo: Randi Baird)\nWhat saves him, in Brooks’s eyes and in ours, is his willingness to be known to history, not just as a name or a list of military victories, but as a man. After some thought (and calculation, as Natan comes to see), he agrees to have the details of his life recorded. He sends Natan, his Boswell, off to interview those who know him best, including some — such as one of his wives, Mikhal, “for whom his very name was bile,” as Natan puts it — who could not be expected to praise him. To his credit, then, David commissions not a hagiography but the kind of fragmented, finally satisfying portrait that might remind the reader less of other Biblical episodes than of King Lear and Citizen Kane.\nIn this warts-and-all narrative, compiled by Natan and reported to us in his voice by Brooks, we piece together the events and forces that have made David who he is. And we see that magnificent, sometimes monstrous creature in action, up to and including his conflict with Absalom and, much later, the challenge of his succession, which ultimately delivers the keys of his kingdom into the hands of Solomon — himself a piece of work worthy of a gifted writer of historical fiction like Brooks. I smell a sequel.\nThe Secret Chord\nBy Geraldine Brooks\nViking, 302 pp.\n3.5 stars out of four\nGoodreads reviews for The Secret Chord USA Today's Best-Selling Books List", "external_links": ["http://www.zolabooks.com/book/9780670025770?utm_source=usatoday&utm_campaign=usatodaypreview", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00SI02CHS", "http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780670025770?aff=usatoday", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-secret-chord/id960040801?mt=11&uo=4&at=11l3Mc", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33209e9b28ed498595ee4723f7697342fd9797ea/r=180/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812030973069778-Secret-Chord-cover.jpg", "http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=KvWLOjf5AfM&offerid=280046.15979781476325286&type=2&murl=http://www.kobobooks.com/search/search.html?q=The%20Secret%20Chord", "http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=KvWLOjf5AfM&subid=&offerid=229293.1&type=10&tmpid=8433&RD_PARM1=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The%20Secret%20Chord/Geraldine%20Brooks/e/9780670025770", "http://www.goodreads.com/api/reviews_widget_iframe?did=5005&format=html&header_text=Goodreads+reviews+for+The%20Secret%20Chord&isbn=9780670025770&links=0AF&review_back=fff&stars=149CEE&stylesheet=http://www.gannett-cdn.com/static/usat-web-static-1629.0/css/bundles/books.min.css?v=1629.0&text=000", "http://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bquery%5D=9780670025770", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1f47d02c566912d08b6700138c281c9e4af995c/c=0-57-682-966&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812031611893873-Geraldine-Brooks-c-Randi-Baird.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The%20Secret%20Chord"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:45:46.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
