If you enjoy sales and a seasonal, outdoor life then this is the business for you. The nursery has been producing quality plants and trees for landscaping and nursery retailers in the central part of the United States for many years. The current owners bought the company at auction in 2004 and have made a strategic business decision to sell the entire operation, land (75 acres), buildings, equipment and inventory. The owners have not been involved in the day to day management or sales for the business since they took ownership, due to explosive growth in other business ventures. Trees planted years ago are now mature and ready for sale. The nursery is ideally positioned for an aggressive individual buyer or for a company seeking to add to their customer list and market by buying this opportunity. Sale of a third of inventory would pay for acquisition. There has been no marketing for over four years on the business, just drop-in traffic. Sale price includes the real estate valued at $700,000, FF&E valued at $30,000 and Inventory of $1,067,815.
