(That’s from June 1, 2014 to June 1, 2015, and before subtracting taxes and management fees.) And yup, much of that cold, hard cash is coming in via Seinfeld reruns. Talk about the gift that keeps on giving.\nNext up on the list is Kevin Hart at $28.5 million and Terry Factor at $21.5 million. Aziz Ansari, Gabriel Iglesias , and Louis C.K. also make appearances. You can see the full list of 11 comedians here, which requires a minimum of $7.5 million to qualify. Additionally, most of their earnings had to come from show ticket sales.\nOne notable lack of representation? There are absolutely no women on the list. What’s the deal with the patriarchy?", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2015/10/21/the-worlds-highest-paid-comedians-2015/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:18:38.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
