The nuptials took place at 11am this past Saturday, and the stunningly beautiful bride opted for a dramatic black wedding dress instead of the traditional white gown. The officiant was none other than Paul Shortino, one of the lead singers in Raiding the Rock Vault and former frontman of Quiet Riot and Rough Cutt. The ceremony, part of a \"Rock Star Wedding\" prize won last April by Danielle Fullmer, was more emotional than most: Danielle's father, who was a huge fan of the songs featured in “Raiding the Rock Vault,” passed away suddenly just weeks after Danielle's engagement to Matthew Bertrand.\nDanielle's bittersweet submission to the contest included her personal tie to the show and the music: \"I was a girl who was raised on classic rock! My dad had a record collection like no one else. I got engaged to a man who my dad thought the world of on Easter, 2014. My dad was ecstatic! Sadly, on May 25th, 2014, my dad passed away in his sleep. He passed away listening to his iPod. My fiance and I listen to his playlist daily. He was so happy I found such an amazing man, and this wedding would put a huge smile on his face. I saw the show (Raiding the Rock Vault) four days after my dad passed away, with my mom. We felt him in that room. He was smiling from dimple to dimple.\"\nThe Rock Star Wedding ceremony package prize awarded to Danielle and Matthew included creative bouquets and floral arrangements, professional photographers, streaming video of the live service for friends and family to view back home, a song performed by officiant and rock icon Paul Shortino during the wedding ceremony, two nights in a romantic suite at the All New Tropicana Las Vegas, and VIP tickets for the bride and groom to see Raiding the Rock Vault and meet the stars backstage. \"We want to thank everyone at the Tropicana who made our Rock Star Wedding absolutely the best day we could ask for! Living out of state, I was a little worried about planning this wedding but Denise Pelletier and the rest of her crew at the Tropicana chapel made everything so easy. Having Paul Shortino as our officiant was a wonderful experience. He was so nice to us and our guests, and had everyone blow away with his sweet song during the ceremony,\" said bride Danielle (formerly Fullmer) Bertrand. \"Everything came together perfectly and our guests couldn't stop talking about how beautiful the wedding ceremony was. The wedding package itself included everything we could possibly need!\"\nThe newlyweds added: \"We would like to give a special thanks to Paul, and the entire Raiding the Rock Vault crew. Our VIP meet and greet with the band was a once in a lifetime experience for us and our family and friends. The seats, the merchandise and the way the made us feel so special was a great end to the perfect day.\"\nThe \"Rock Star Minister\" was touched to be part of this special Las Vegas wedding that had so many emotional moments for the bride who grew up listening to songs featured in Raiding the Rock Vault. \"I was honored to officiate at Danielle and Matthew's ceremony,\" Paul Shortino commented after the heartwarming ceremony. \"There were so many very special moments and it was incredible to witness the love, grace and gratitude they clearly have for each other. So Happy to be the one to complete their union of matrimony. I wish a lifetime of bliss for the new Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand!\" #ForeverOne #BigLove\nAbout Tropicana LV Weddings\nTropicana LV Weddings is a full-service wedding venue on the South Las Vegas Strip.
