I'm wiping my bum!\" \nCara is an avid Instagram user and she likes to try and lean on the photo-sharing site to help \"troubled teenagers\" by giving them an insight into her \"normal\" life. \nThe 23-year-old star - who recently appeared in the Joe Wright-directed movie 'Pan' - said: \"For me, I wanted to make people see that I was just like anyone else and also I like to use it [Instagram] when I'm not happy about things. \n\"I like to speak my mind.
