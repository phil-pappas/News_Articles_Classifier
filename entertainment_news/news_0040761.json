Not only were a handful of music-only trophies given out at the several-hour-long ceremony the other evening, but there were performances by the groups Salt N Pepa and alternative act X Ambassadors. Both bands had notable years in advertising thanks to their working with big brands (Geico and Jeep, respectively), and the CLIOs clearly want to highlight how important these partnerships are, especially these days when record sales are disappearing and new revenue streams are needed to make a living.Many of the most poignant moments of the night came from the acceptance speeches and accompanying videos of those campaigns that focused on helping people. Burger King used its Whopper to help eliminate homophobia, a German brand fought the Nazis that have plagued their country for decades, and other brands aimed to bring attention to other important causes, such as female genital mutilation and domestic violence against women. It’s really great to see companies going out of their way to use impressive marketing budgets to not just push product, but to make a difference, and the CLIOs honored a lot of that effort.Here is a list of those campaigns that were awarded “Grand CLIOs”, the biggest prize: Audio - Leica - SoundLab Container (F/Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi, São Paulo) Branded Entertainment - Affordable Care Act - Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis: President Barack Obama (Funny or Die, Los Angeles) Digital - Optus - Clever Buoy (M&C Saatchi, Sydney) Direct - Burger King - Proud Whopper (DAVID, Miami) Engagement/Experiential - ZDK Gesellschaft Demokratische Kultur gGmbH (Nazis against Nazis - Germany's Most Involuntary Charity Walk) (Grabarz & Partner / GGH Lowe, Hamburg) Innovative - ZDK Gesellschaft Demokratische Kultur gGmbH (Nazis against Nazis - Germany's Most Involuntary Charity Walk) (Grabarz & Partner / GGH Lowe, Hamburg) Integrated Campaign - Vodafone - \"Between Us\" (Y&R [entity display=\"Team\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"team\" ticker=\"TISI\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/9653\"]Team[/entity] Red Istanbul, Istanbul) Out Of Home - Apple - World Gallery © TBWA/Media Arts Lab, Los Angeles) Print - 28 Too Many - It Happens Here © (Ogilvy & Mather, London) Public Relations - Optus - Clever Buoy (Fuel Communications, Sydney) Social Media - Domino's - Emoji Ordering (CP+B, Boulder) CLIO Music - Partnerships/Collaborations - Spotify / Uber - Your Ride.
