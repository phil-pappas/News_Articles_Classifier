Ann Romney's guide to being a freaking awesome grandma John Clyde, KSL.com - johnpclyde@gmail.com dailyamerican.com | 0 comments \nG MAMA’S HIZZY — Mitt Romney isn’t running for president this go around, but his wife Ann is running for the grandma with the most game. \nThis video “dropped,” in the words of Ann, titled “How to be a Freaking Awesome Grandma With Ann Romney.” \nIt’s a short video of Ann showing you how to slay it with your grandkids. Some of the tips include a stocked kitchen; with sweets, of course; video games; and always dressing the part. That one is the real winner. \nFor all those who thought you had nothing in common with the Romneys, you were wrong. Turns out you both have personalities and realize seeing a grandmother of 20+ sporting a gold chain, a flat-brimmed cap and knitting a “Kanye 2020” sweater is what’s been missing in your lives. \nThe other thing we can all agree on is that while we appreciate the title “How to be a Freaking Awesome Grandma With Ann Romney,” it pales in comparison to the other possible title, “How to be a Baller Grandma With Ann Romney.” John Clyde, KSL.com John has been writing about movies, news, sports and pretty much anything awesome for more than five years.
