The men of Full House just can't get enough of each other! Bob Saget is set to join John Stamos in Grandfathered . The network has announced that Saget, who had just made a cameo in Tuesday's premiere, will be returning to the comedy. This time, he will be introduced as Ronnie, Jimmy's longtime best friend who reminds him that he can still have a wild guys' night even though he's learning to be a father and grandfather. As of now Saget is set to appear in only one episode (but we have a feeling he could return, since clearly these guys like working together). The news comes on the heels of the announcement that their fellow Full House pal Dave Coulier will be appearing in an upcoming episode. Meanwhile, all three are also filming their Fuller House revival series for Netflix. Grandfathered airs Tuesdays at 8/7c on Fox.
