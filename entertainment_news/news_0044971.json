Eight of the 15 potential honorees are first-timers, although none are in their first year of eligibility. \nMore than 800 artists and members of the music industry vote on the inductees, who will be announced in December. Fans also can vote on the rock hall’s website toward a “fan’s ballot” that also will be counted. \nArtists back on the ballot for another try are Chic, Deep Purple, N.W.A., Nine Inch Nails, the Smiths, the Spinners and Yes. \nJanet – Miss Jackson if you’re nasty – would uphold a family tradition. The Jackson 5 were inducted in 1997, and her late brother Michael joined as a solo artist in 2001. The singer of “If,” “All For You” and “That’s the Way Love Goes” just released “Unbreakable,” her first new disc since 2008. \nThe Cleveland-based Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum generally inducts five performers a year, along with separately considered inductees in categories such as nonperformers or early influences. \nThe induction ceremony will be in New York in April, at a venue and date to be announced later, and HBO will televise it at a later date.
