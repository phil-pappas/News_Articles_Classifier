He was part of the generation of surrealists but never a surrealist himself and he was without doubt the greatest figurative painter of the 20th Century. \n\"He was born in 1908, died in 2001. He lived through the entire 20th century and remained extremely faithful to an extremely realist form of painting, albeit a realism that absorbed a subtle and light form of fantasy. And I'd say it is that which makes the poetry and uniqueness of Balthus.\"\n- 'Not a paedophile' -\nView gallery A man looks at paintings by late French artist Balthus (1908-2001)as he visits the exhibition dedica … This collection is lighter on the kind of images of girls on the cusp of womanhood that led one critic to brand Balthus \"one of the creepiest figures in modern art\" after the New York exhibition.\nDebray acknowledges that painting \"very young girls with a very strong erotic suggestion\" was a defining theme of Balthus's work, but robustly dismisses any suggestion the work could be regarded as indicative of a predatory sexual interest in minors.\n\"Until now they never caused any debate but it is true that very recently we have seen some rather prudish reactions to his painting as there has been much debate around the subject of paedophilia,\" she said.\n\"I think it is very important to recall that these are paintings, i.e. representations, and that Balthus was absolutely not a paedophile.\n\"It (what he is doing) is much more a reflection on the nature of eroticism, the nature of beauty and a sort of desire to engage the public on the essential subjects of eroticism and sexuality.\n\"He wanted to shake up the art world through a very intelligent use of a realism that suggests erotic or grotesque atmospheres. It is this very individual painting that still engages the public today and can also still disturb.\"\nThe exhibitions are on until the end of January after which the collection at the Scuderie will move to the Kunstforum in Vienna.\nBudget, Tax & Economy Singapore International News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:28:08.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
