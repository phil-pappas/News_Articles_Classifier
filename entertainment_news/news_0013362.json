De ATLEY / STAFF WRITER\nPublished: Oct. 8, 2015 Updated: Oct. 12, 2015 10:23 a.m. Diamonds and Dust AAA started inspecting lodgings in 1937. Hotels initiate application for a review – not all are accepted – and there is a one-time administrative processing fee.\nInspections by trained personnel are unannounced, but candidate hotels know the standards they have to meet to get, or lose, the ratings.\n28,000 hotels inspected annually\n0.4 percent get a five-diamond rating\n5.4 percent get a four-diamond rating\nWhat's it all mean? Five diamonds: \"Ultimate luxury, sophistication and comfort with extraordinary physical attributes...\"\nFour diamonds: \"Refined, stylish with upscale physical attributes, extensive amenities and a high degree of hospitality...\"\nThree diamonds: \"Distinguished, multifaceted with enhanced physical attributes...\"\nTwo diamonds: \"Affordable, with modestly enhanced facilities, decor and amenities.\"\nOne diamond: \"Budget-oriented, offering basic comfort and hospitality.\"\nSource: AAA\nOn a recent Tuesday at the Mission Inn, a woman in black went everywhere and looked at everything – right into the men’s room of the pool’s cabana she went, then marched into the spa without an appointment, strode into (unoccupied) rooms, flipped through the guest books, fiddled with the TV remotes, yanked at drawers and doors, pulled apart the bedding, and then just walked out.\nAnd though she has done this elsewhere – up to 2,000 times over the past three years – no one at the various lodges where she stopped knows who she is.\nThe inn, which displays its four-diamond AAA ratings from 2013 through 2015 on plaques over its lobby desk, just got an unannounced annual visit from an anonymous AAA inspector who will determine the 2016 rating.\nOnly 5.4 percent of the 28,000 hotels inspected by the AAA get a four-diamond rating. The top is five diamonds, and recently-hired Mission Inn general manager Patrick Yip said in an interview he wants to get there.\nOnline reviews from websites such as TripAdvisor have become a common source for travelers’ inquiries in the past two decades.\nBut hotel industry observers say traditional tour-book ratings from AAA and Forbes (which took over the Mobil Travel Guide) remain an important marketing counter-tool for facilities such as the Mission Inn, where potential guests are weighing value, service, ambiance and amenities as well as price.\nA recent study from the Cornell University Center for Hospitality Research concluded that while online ratings had little effect on economy and mid-priced hotels, “an increasing number of reviews actually has negative effects on higher-end hotels.”\nThe online reviews “may be honest, but they also may be fraudulent schlock from a disgruntled ex-employee; and who’s to be the wiser,” wrote Larry Mogelonsky in Lodging Hospitality magazine.\n“The typical online reviews are more emotion-based,” Mission Inn director of sales and marketing Shannon Walters said, while the unannounced AAA inspections use standardized metrics and are fact-based. “The four diamonds means we meet those standards.”\nNOT A ‘GOTCHA’\nWhile the inspections are not disclosed in advance, they are not “gotcha” visits, explained Automobile Club of Southern California spokeswoman Elaine Beno.\nThe trained inspector was followed on her check of the Mission Inn by The Press-Enterprise. The newspaper agreed in advance to use only her title, Inspector 566, and that of her supervisor, Inspector 63, and not to show their faces on camera.\nThe two women announced themselves at the desk on the morning of the visit, and asked to meet with management, who accompanied Inspector 566.\nBefore she began making her rounds on Sept. 29, the inspector sat down with inn general manager Yip and food and beverage director/executive chef Loren Lawe checking the basics: the hotel’s phone number, website address and number of rooms (238, some with two bathrooms), among other details.\n(Restaurants are reviewed separately. The inn’s Duane’s Prime Steaks & Seafood has a four-diamond restaurant rating from AAA.)\nBefore Inspector 566 went into the rooms, she looked over the inn’s pool area, and cabana, its spa and exercise room. She later looked at the hotel’s other properties and facilities.\nThere were no white gloves used in the guest rooms, but she checked for dust with her right hand, running over the milled sections of doors, inside the lampshades, the curtains and over the top of the bedstead.\nAnd because she used her right hand for that, she used only her left hand to look at the bedding – five pillows, a bed cover, sheets and the cushion padding beneath, all upturned, gone over and transformed from bounce-a-quarter, guest-ready to a big heap.\nA loose hinge on a drop-down door of a bureau/televison stand was fixed immediately by staff.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:08:17.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
