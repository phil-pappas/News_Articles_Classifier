Reuters / Eddie Keogh \nPrince Harry was spotted with his sister-in-law's family at the Rugby World Cup as he passionately cheered on England in the match against Australia at Twickenham Stadium. Harry, who previously attended the England versus Wales match with his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate, was urged to pull his support from England and cheer on Wales. \nAccording to Hello! Magazine , Harry sported a white England jersey during the match. The 31-year-old prince is the honourary president of England Rugby 2015, the committee which is staging the world cup. He is also the vice patron of the Rugby Football Union. \nHarry was joined by Carole and Michael Middleton, their son James, and his longtime friends Charlie Van Straubenzee and club manager Guy Pelly, Hello! reported. The fourth-in-line to the throne also attended the opening ceremony last month with William and Kate and gave a speech to the millions tuning in. \n\"This evening marks the beginning of a celebration of rugby which I hope will inspire current players, those new to the game and future generations,\" Harry said. The trio met up again to watch the England-Wales match on 26 September, which saw an excited Prince William, the vice royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, celebrate Wales's over England. \nWales Online reported that Harry has been urged to switch his allegiance from England to Wales. Following the win, Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde called on the rugby-loving prince to show his support for neighbouring Wales. \n\"It would be nice to think fans are supporting us. Both my sisters have partners from England and I have a brother-in-law who is English. It's not too much to ask as they're so close,\" McBryde said. Harry may want to consider taking the coach's invite following England's defeat against Australia 33-13.
