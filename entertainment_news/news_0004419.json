PICTURE: JUSTIN BRIERTY Source: News Corp Australia \nCASPER might be the original friendly ghost, but the Far North is said to have a benevolent spirit of its own. \nParonella Park marketing and promotion manager Luke Evans said there were a host of ghostly stories surrounding the attraction, but the most common was that the castle’s founder, Jose Paronella, continued to watch over his creation. \nA self-confessed sceptic, Mr Evans said visitors often reported feeling Mr Paro­nella’s “presence” during night tours. \n“It’s often spoken about as a positive presence,” he said. \nMr Evans said that during past cyclones, wind had pushed large trees over in such a way that they had fallen without doing any damage to the buildings. \n“People talk about Jose looking over the park and protecting it,” he said. \nIf a real-life encounter with Mr Paronella isn’t quite your thing, you can relive all the ghostly goodness of the 1995 family action comedy Casper , available for $2.50 from participating newsagents, Coles, Woolworths and IGA supermarkets with a token inside Monday’s The Cairns Post. \nIt comes after yesterday’s Stuart Little token in The Weekend Post , and The Lorax token included in today’s The Sunday Mail . \nThere are 14 DVDs to collect as part of the Ultimate Family Movie Collection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:03:56.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
