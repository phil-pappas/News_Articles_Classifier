Read, 17, who is a senior at Wilson Magnet High School, has since sixth grade spent one Saturday a month during the school year in a program — often involving community service or a college-prep activity — sponsored by the Rochester Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.\n\"This constant exposure to college-educated women has helped her focus on graduating and going to college,\" said her mother, Denise Read.\nBrittany Read also tells how the participants develop friendships and common goals.\n\"We have this special bond — we have become sisters,\" she said.\nThe program — the Delta Academy for junior high students and the Delta GEMS for high schoolers — each year has helped mentor about 20 students, who are selected on a competitive basis that includes consideration of grades and essays.\nDeltas often have strong roots that run deep in families and represent certain values.\nBecoming a Delta is a family tradition for Ashley Anderson, whose mother, Sheila Anderson, is a Delta, as are several cousins and an aunt.\n\"Being a Delta means being a woman of fortitude. All of the Delta women I know have this amazing strength of courage to address social justice issues,\" said Anderson, 28, who is a member of the local alumnae chapter and is director of diversity programming at the University of Rochester.\nEducation is a trademark of this predominately black alumnae group, which on Friday celebrates its 50th anniversary with Delta Days at City Hall.\nMelany J. Silas (Photo: photo provided)\n\"We'll meet with the mayor and her staff and decide what we can do to lend a hand,\" said chapter president Melany J. Silas, who also is an associate professor of health studies at Monroe Community College.\nIn addition to the Delta Academy and Delta GEMS, the local alumnae group has initiatives for educational development, economic development, international awareness and involvement, political awareness and involvement, and physical and mental health.\nPublic service is a thread that runs through the programs of the Deltas.\nGrace Douglass of Rochester runs through Cobbs Hill Park during the Rochester Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority's 5K run on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015. (Photo: JEFF WITHEROW)\nThis past Saturday, the alumnae chapter held a 5K Walk/Run for Education fundraiser, along with a health fair, at Cobbs Hill Park. About 100 people participated, with the proceeds used for college scholarships.\nThe local alumnae chapter is one of about 1,000 chapters — undergraduate and alumnae — of Delta Sigma Theta, located in the United States and seven other nations. The undergraduate Rochester chapter, which is separate from the alumnae chapter, is currently inactive.\nCurrently, there are eight predominately black sororities and fraternities in the Rochester area, said Silas.\nDelta Sigma Theta was established in 1913 by 22 students at Howard University in Washington, D.C., as one of the first black sororities.\n\"At this high point of the Progressive Era, Howard, African-Americans and women were on the move — and so were the 22 young coeds who saw themselves an integral part of the developments swirling around them,\" wrote Paula Giddings in her book , In Search of Sisterhood: Delta Sigma Theta and The Challenge of the Black Sorority Movement .\nMany black sororities and fraternities, Giddings went on to note, emerged back then \"as effective weapons against racism, sexism and social isolation.\"\nWithin two months of Delta Sigma Theta's formation, members participated in a march for the right of women to vote. As an indication of the sorority's commitment to education, 10 of its 22 charter members went on to graduate school.\nBrittany Read feels connected to this tradition.\nLast Saturday, she went with her mother for a visit to Howard University in Washington, D.C. — the college that she hopes to attend next fall.\nBrittany Read (Photo: Photo provided)\nRead's mother took a photo of her daughter next to a tree on the Howard campus that has Delta's Greek letters on it.\n\"It's interesting and really exciting to see where everything started,\" said Brittany Read.\nThe Rochester alumnae chapter formed in 1965, a year after Rochester was rocked by racial unrest and many organizations took hold.\nDeane Turner, who was one of 15 founding members of the Rochester alumnae chapter, said that while many of the founders went to different churches and their children attended different schools, the women who founded the chapter gradually got to know each other.\nThe first meeting was held at the Rochester home of her sister-in-law, Mary Janet McElrath, with subsequent monthly meetings held at the homes of different members.\n\"We wanted to form an alumnae chapter — to carry out what we did in college,\" said McElrath, who joined the Delta sorority as an undergraduate at Morgan State University in Baltimore.\nThe alumnae chapter avoided partisan politics but was determined to promote civil rights.\n\"We needed to exercise our right as a race,\" said Turner, who now lives in Albany.\nVoter registration and tutoring students in local schools were the focus of the chapter's activity.\nToday, the alumnae chapter has about 65 dues-paying members, said Silas. They meet once a month at the Rochester Regional Health building on Genesee Street. There are about 10 committees that work on projects and priorities.\nWhile the priorities are set by the national organization, the Rochester alumnae chapter implements them, with various programs at different times.\nOver the years, the local alumnae chapter has sponsored or participated in such programs as hosting a three-day visit to Rochester by teens from other locations, enlisting adults to read aloud to children and holding art shows to showcase the work of local black artists.\nVoter registration has continued to be a priority for the chapter, which registered voters at the annual Corn Hill Festival and Clarissa Street Reunion in recent years.\nThe alumnae chapter's emphasis on education drew Kimberly Winfrey to join in 2008.\n\"It's huge,\" said Winfrey, 52, who teaches fourth grade at School 4. She is first vice-president of the chapter and chairs the scholarship committee, which gives five to seven scholarships for college a year for up to $1,500 per student.\nKimberly Winfrey (Photo: Photo provided)\nThe Academy and GEM programs are constant reminders to the participating students of where they should be headed.\n\"It has helped me a lot to get ready for college,\" said K'neadee Jackson, 17, who is in her third year in the GEM program and tells how monthly Saturday gatherings have helped her develop skills in public speaking and encouraged community service.\nJackson is a senior at Rochester Early College International High School.\nThe Deltas offer a support system, both in offering inspiration and guidance and helping in times of need.\nTurner tells how the Delta alumnae chapter was a big help to her when she moved to Albany.\n\"When you become a Delta, you're always a Delta, no matter where you are, because you are sisters,\" Turner said.\nJGOODMAN@Gannett.com\nUpcoming events\nThe Rochester Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc's upcoming events in Rochester include:\nA workshop on financial investment and retirement planning on Oct. 15 at the Church of Love Faith Center, 700 Exchange St. Candidates' night on Oct. 20 at the Mt.
