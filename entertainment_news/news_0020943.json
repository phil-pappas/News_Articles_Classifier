The one Billboard labeled \"totally bonkers\"? Well, according to Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's son, it was all just a social experiment. \n\"Me and Willow are scientists so everything for us is a scientific test upon humanity. And luckily we're put in a position where we can affect large groups of human beings at one time,\" he explained to GQ magazine. \nJaden added that he and his sister test their fame often and the New York Times interview was just the latest in the experiment. \n\"That experiment -- it went really, really well,\" he said. \"We got to see how people reacted. And they actually ended up reacting exactly as we predicted beforehand that they would react.\" \nJaden said his tests on society are \"fun.\" \n\"That's what a lot of people don't realize. It's fun. It's so much fun. It's the best thing,\" he added. \"People think you're crazy -- I feel like it's an honor, actually, for people to think I'm crazy. Because they thought Galileo was crazy, too, you know what I'm saying? I don't think I'm as revolutionary as Galileo, but I don't think I'm not as revolutionary as Galileo.\" \nFor now, Jaden is using his talents in Baz Luhrmann's The Get Down, a Netflix musical drama centered on 1970s New York. It's set for release in 2016. According to GQ , he'll play a \"graffiti writer\" and so he's learning much about hip-hop culture. \nJaden wants to continue learning about any and everything for the rest of his life. \"That's what I really encourage kids to do, is learn the things that you want to learn, because then not only will school become fun, but it will make your dreams come true,\" he explained. \"My whole life is just dedicated on learning and breaking, like, the craziest records of life, and being like one of the craziest human beings to ever exist. That's me.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
