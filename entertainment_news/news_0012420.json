Patriots 4-0 (1): Running back Dion Lewis has provided new dimension for offense.\n2. Packers 5-0 (2): They've won 12 consecutive games at Lambeau Field.\n3. Bengals 5-0 (4): They're 5-0 for the first time since 1988, which is the last time Cincinnati reached the Super Bowl.\n4. Broncos 5-0 (3): The offense ranks 30th in yards per game. That's how good this defense is playing right now.\n5. Falcons 5-0 (6): Can't put them in the class as some of the other unbeatens but nothing phony about the top-ranked run defense allowing only 78 yards per game.\n6. Cardinals 4-1 (7): Free-agent running back Chris Johnson has worked so well Arizona went out and signed defensive end Dwight Freeney this week.\n7. Panthers 4-0 (5): At Seattle this week and they've lost four times to Seahawks since 2012. All of them have been close.\n8. Jets 3-1 (9): Rough and tumble defense is better with end Sheldon Richardson returning from suspension.\n9. Steelers 3-2 (11): Chargers are far from great but traveling across the country to beat them with Mike Vick on the final play was as gritty as it was impressive.\n10. Seahawks 2-3 (8): After blowing 17-point lead at Cincinnati, it's looking more like the Legion of Gloom.\n11. Giants 3-2 (12): Eli Manning has 10 touchdown passes and two interceptions and is playing as well as he has in years.\n12. Bills 3-2 (13): Boobie Dixon and Daniel Herron are the only healthy running backs and that's not much support for QB Tyrod Taylor.\n13. Vikings 2-2 (14): Three of their next four games are on the road but they travel to face Lions, Bears and Raiders.\n14. Colts 3-2 (18): All three victories have come against lowly AFC South rivals and suddenly they're two games up in the division.\n15. Rams 2-3 (10): In three games, electric rookie Todd Gurley has 314 rushing yards to tie for 13th in the league.\n16. Chargers 2-3 (15): Antonio Gates made a splash in his return from suspension. Too bad he can't block for Philip Rivers while catching passes.\n17. Eagles 2-3 (21): Let's see how far the Chip Kelly to USC rumors carry.\n18. Bears 2-3 (27): Chance to climb even at .500 headed into week off. Think most would have signed up for that before season started.\n19. Cowboys 2-3 (19): They're off this week and Matt Cassel should emerge as the starter in place of Brandon Weeden before they play again.\n20. Redskins 2-3 (20): 1-9 on the road under Jay Gruden and travel to face a nasty Jets defense. Look out.\n21. Raiders 2-3 (22): Charles Woodson, in his 18th season, said he wanted to intercept Peyton Manning once in his career. He got him twice but Oakland still lost.\n22. Browns 2-3 (30): First-year offensive coordinator John DeFilippo getting some early recognition for his work with Josh McCown.\n23. Ravens 1-4 (17): Once vaunted defense blew two fourth-quarter leads and surrendered 505 yards offense to Browns.\n24. Dolphins 1-3 (23): Interim coach Dan Campbell is fighting a culture problem. Good luck sorting that out starting in Week 6.\n25. Titans 1-3 (24): Marcus Mariota has been under constant pressure as offensive line struggles to come together.\n26. Chiefs 1-4 (16): It's soul searching time for a club that figured it was poised to take over the penthouse in the AFC West.\n27. Buccaneers 2-3 (31): All of a sudden Doug Martin looks like a rookie again and the Bucs' 11-game home losing streak is over.\n28. 49ers 1-4 (28): Not sure if Vic Fangio would recognize the defense currently in place.\n29. Texans 1-4 (25): QB carousel spins and now Brian Hoyer has a chance to start versus the Jaguars. Bill O'Brien can't turn back to Ryan Mallett.\n30. Saints 1-4 (26): Colts and Dolphins mentioned as destinations for Sean Payton with ship sinking. How about a return to Giants if Tom Coughlin retires?\n31. Jaguars 1-4 (29): Will Gus Bradley make it through the entire season as head coach?\n32. Lions 0-5 (32): Pretty soon this could turn from bad to toxic.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\nPrivacy Policy Travel New York Jets Indianapolis Colts Seattle Seahawks New York Giants Jacksonville Jaguars Detroit Lions", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d31dd/turbine/ct-biggs-nfl-rankings-spt-1014-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:13:27.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
