Thanks goes to Jeff Beede for stepping up and promoting the Calvin Center show. Beede presents concerts at Calvin Center maybe once a year, but he’s an Ike Reilly fan. \nTickets are $10 (plus fees) at brownpapertickets.com. They also can be obtained by calling or texting Beede at 330-774-4935. The Rust Belt theater has a capacity of 120, and if sales exceed that, the show will be moved to the larger room on the third floor of the building. \nBeede will obtain a temporary beer and wine license for the concert. No definitive word yet on the opening act, but if there is one, it likely will be Youngstown band Punk Willie. \nReilly’s songs are typically jammed with wily lyrics from the point of view of hard-living characters. \nHe has been playing in bars and clubs for a long time but might finally be poised to reach the next level. \nReilly’s latest album, “Born on Fire,” was released in June. \nCALIFORNIA IMPRESSIONISM EXHIBITION AT THE BUTLER \nA noteworthy exhibition titled “California Impressionism: Selections from the Irvine Museum” opens Sunday at the Butler Institute of American Art and runs through Nov. 29. \nThe exhibition spotlights the unique style that came out of the state in the mid-20th century that combined aspects of European and American art. The style was dubbed California Impressionism and concerned itself with light and color. The landscape was usually the principal subject. \nThe exhibition is from the Irvine Museum in California. James Irvine Swinden, president of the museum, will be at the Butler Sunday to give a talk at 2 p.m. in the auditorium. Jean Stern, director of the Irvine, also will be on hand to share the art with the public at a reception that will run from 1 to 3 p.m. \nSONGWRITER MAGAZINE SPOTLIGHTS JORDAN DEPAUL \nJordan DePaul, a Youngstown native and Nashville musical artist and songwriter, caught the attention of American Songwriter magazine (americansongwriter.com). \nDePaul was the “daily discovery” in a recent issue for his song “Me + U.” \nAmerican Songwriter did a short profile of DePaul that allowed him to reveal why he wrote the song. \nDePaul’s response: “No matter how hard you try, some things just don’t fit together. Love is a very relatable subject and, after a failed five-year relationship, I realized that there was no sense in trying anymore. It just simply was not going to work. That’s what the single from my forthcoming “Forces” EP, “Me + U,” is about.” \nRUST BELT THEATER ADDS ‘GAY WEDDING’ PERFORMANCE \nIn order to meet demand, Rust Belt Theater has added a performance of its original musical “My Big Fat Gay Wedding.” It will be at 8 p.m. Friday in Rust Belt’s theater space in Calvin Center, 755 Mahoning Ave. \nThe final performance of the run will be the previously scheduled show Saturday at 8 p.m. \nTickets are $15 ($10 for students and senior citizens). For reservations, call 330-507-2358. Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:33:07.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
