Fans dressed as characters from the beloved sci-fi film series and participated in hoverboard and DeLorean rides. \nThe event's organizers selected Fillmore for Thursday's festivities because of its proximity to Los Angeles and resemblance to the Hill Valley town square set on the Universal Studios lot. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:50:13.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
