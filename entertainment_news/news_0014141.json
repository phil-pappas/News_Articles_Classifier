Tacoma Public Schools Courtesy i Order Reprint of this Story \nIn the beginning and in the end, the Beatles rocked. \nBut as their 1960s fame grew, they also gained the freedom to experiment with other forms of music. \n“In My Life: A Musical Theatre Tribute to the Beatles,” which comes to the Rialto Theater Oct. 16, will showcase some of the Beatles’ classical underpinnings. \nAnd the show will do it with a little help from some local friends. Four Tacoma School of the Arts students — Madeline Meek, Emily Hutchinson, Julian Bennett and Abbie Foulon — will form a string quartet and join the show for the songs “Eleanor Rigby,” “Yesterday,” “A Day in the Life,” “Hello, Goodbye” and “Hey Jude.” \nThe multi-media production features the Beatles tribute band Abbey Road. Producers of the traveling “In My Life” production seek out young musicians to join their performance wherever they go. \nSOTA student Madeline Meek is a lifelong Beatles fan who grew up with their music \nIn the production, “Yesterday” is played in a scene that re-enacts Paul McCartney playing the song for the first time to Beatles producer George Martin. Martin, a classically trained musician before he became a record producer, was influential in exposing the Beatles to classical music. \nThe show is a re-telling of the Beatles’ rise to fame from a dingy Liverpool basement club to international superstardom. It’s told through the eyes of the Beatles’ manager who guided them on the journey, Brian Epstein. Epstein, who died of a drug overdose in 1967, was inducted last year into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. \nDebbie Cafazzo: 253-597-8635", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:52:37.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
