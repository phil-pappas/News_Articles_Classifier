Photo: Ben Rushton \nFairfax has pulled off a coup securing Splendour in the Grass hotshot promoter double-act Jess Ducrou​ and Paul Piticco​ to run the music program, in the Domain, for the Spectrum Now arts festival in 2016.\nThe duo will run the Big Top, \"a 2000 to 2500\" capacity music venue in the Playground part of Spectrum Now in the Domain.  \nThe duo, named fifth in the Australian Music Industry DIrectory's list of the industry's most powerful people, will curate an 11-night program of gigs with up to three international and local acts each night. They promise a line-up good enough to sell out the Big Top every night.\nDucrou​ says they will look to create an event pitched \"somewhere between Splendour and Vivid\" and will \"hand pick\" a small selection of artists. \nAdvertisement \"It's going allow us to tailor-make a program specific for Spectrum Now ... that's a real challenge for us and it's exciting,\" Ducrou​ said.\n\"It's something that Paul and I have been interested in doing and that is programming someone else's event ... it allows us to be 100 per cent focused on the artists. A lot of our job is not about the music. I know more about fencing panels than you would care to ask.\n\"We look forward to putting our Splendour touch on the Spectrum Now program.\"\nThe pair said their line-up would surprise Splendour fans, by including more electronica, singer-songwriters and world music. \nAlthough there are no acts confirmed yet, Ducrou​ and Piticco​ said some Bluesfest​  acts could be on the cards if the dates work out.\nBluesfest​ is only half way through naming its line-up, but so far The National, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, The Decemberists​, Jeff Tweedy and City and Colour are on that bill.\nDucrou​ said ticket prices \"would be on par with the Enmore as opposed to the Opera House\".\nSpectrum Now's Big Top music line-up, held between March 3 and 13, 2016, is due to be announced in mid-November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:36:55.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
