Red | Oct. 09, 2015 at 05:40pm \n5The Kapuso stars can no longer wait for the fun of the much-anticipated MassKara festival to officially begin. They are excited to jump start the celebration coming to the City of Smiles earlier than the festival. \nMassKara Festival officially starts on the third week of October, yet Bacoleños will see colors in advance with the Kapuso Network celebrities visiting to be with their fans in the Negros Occidental capital on tomorrow and Monday. Lovi Poe \nBeautiful Strangers stars Lovi Poe and Benjamin Alves are excited to personally meet and bond with the Bacoleños in a Kapuso Mall Show Sunday, 5 p.m. at SM City Bacolod Main Atrium. The award-winning actress and the Kapuso heartthrob are both eager to feel the warm welcome of Bacolod City. Benjamin Alves \nJoining Poe and Alves are the stars of GMA afternoon prime series Destiny Rose. Ken Chan who plays the lead character Joey and Fabio Ide as his love interest Gabriel prepared special numbers and lots of surprises for their fans. Fabio Ide \nThe excitement continues with another exciting mall show the following day, Monday. Some of the members of the cast of Buena Familia arrive for a meet-and-greet session. Asia’s Pop Sweetheart Julie Anne San Jose with co-stars Julian Trono and Jake Vargas perform and play some fun games with the Bacoleños 5 p.m. also at the SM City Bacolod Main Atrium. Julie Anne San Jose \nThe massive display of colors through dresses, large masks and headpieces make the MassKara festival the one of the most colorful festivals in the country. More than these are the happy personalities and beautiful smiles of the Bacoleños that make the event more meaningful. That is why the Kapuso stars are more than willing to go the extra mile just to be with their supporters from the City of Smiles. Julian Trono \n“Every year, GMA Network is always happy to celebrate with the Bacoleños for the MassKara festival. Bringing to you GMA’s biggest Kapuso stars is our way of extending the Network’s gratitude for Bacolod City’s unwavering support,” says Oliver Amoroso, GMA’s Head for Regional Strategy and Business Development Division. \nTraining Ken Chan to be a woman \nIn preparation for the biggest transformation on Philippine TV, Kapuso heartthrob and now LGBT advocate Ken Chan has been training under Jonas Gaffud, the country’s most famous beauty queen maker. \nThe GMA Artist Center star expresses his gratitude for the overwhelming support that the afternoon prime series Destiny Rose has been getting from its viewers. It remains to be the daily trending topic on social media, and it has also taken over the ratings game. With this kind of feedback, Ken feels committed to work harder and give their supporters something more beautiful to look forward to. \n“Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga Kapusong nagpapa-trend at sumusubaybay sa Destiny Rose. Para sa inyo itong ginagawa ko, ang mag-training nang naka-high heels, kasama ang beauty queen maker na si Sir Jonas. Sobrang nakakatuwa kasi ‘di ba, nakahilera na ako sa mga beauty queens.” \nOne of the things Ken observes as he portrays a transgender is the demeanor and the attitude that comes with it. Despite the challenge, the Destiny Rose actor maintains that he will do whatever it takes to give justice to his role, out of respect for the LGBT community. From the day he took the role, he has already learned a lot about transgenders and the difficulties they go through in life. \n“Ngayon, mas tumaas yung tingin ko sa kanila and I believe na Destiny Rose ang magiging instrument para sabihin sa mga taong pare-pareho lang tayong lahat. Hindi biro ang mag-represent sa kanila and to give justice to that, kailangan ko pang pagbutihan. Isa sa mga mahirap gawin talaga ay yung paglakad, yung tindig and yung pagsuot ng heels. Sobrang masakit sa paa pero kailangan, para mabuo ko nang mas maganda si Destiny Rose and I’m doing this for you guys,” Ken concludes. \nDestiny Rose airs Monday to Friday at 4:30 p.m. on GMA Afternoon Prime. \nFans swarm around ‘StarStruck’ Ultimate Final 14 \nIf the crowd in Malolos, Bulacan is an indication of the future of the StarStruck Ultimate 14, then these young men and women should brace for even bigger crowds in the future.
