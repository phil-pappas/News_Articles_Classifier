The actor, who was introduced to the film industry with 2014 film Mukunda, has two back-to-back films – Kanche and Loafer – slated to release in the next couple of months. \nWhile Kanche, set in the backdrop of World War II, is scheduled to release in November, according to the latest buzz in T-town, the makers of Loafer are looking to release the film in December. \n“The shooting of Loafer has been completed and the makers are confident of finishing post-production and release the film in December. Since no other major film has announced their release at that time, the makers are keen to release Loafer in December itself and avoid a packed Sankranthi calendar,” revealed a source in the know. \nLoafer also marks the return of Puri Jagannadh who has to recover from the debacle of Jyothi Lakshmi and the disappointment of being sidecast for Chiranjeevi’s 150th film. Produced by C Kalyan, Loafer also features Disha Patani as the female lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:15:12.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
