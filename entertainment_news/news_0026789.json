This is one of the finest works from one of the greatest twentieth century dramatists and was his first great Broadway success. It was radical and bold when it was first produced almost 70 years ago, a quality which it retains uniquely to this day, making it a perfect fit for the work we are creating at Nuffield.” \nWritten by Tennessee Williams (A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) in 1944 and partly based on the author’s own youth, The Glass Menagerie is considered one of the great plays of the twentieth century.
