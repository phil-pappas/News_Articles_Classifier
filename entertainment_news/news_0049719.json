He was introduced by PVB Vice President for Communications Mike Villa-Real.\n(From left): Historian Bernard Karganilla, Neneng de Ocampo, Col.Emmanuel V. de Ocampo, producer Mai Guillermo and director Bani Logrono\nA Peter Parsons-Lucky Guillermo presentation, “Unsurrendered 2” is directed by Bani Logrono, who is also writer; with Mai Guillermo as producer, and Villa-Real and Lucky Guillermo as executive producers.\nThe 53-minute documentary film gives viewers a glimpse into what prompted teenaged PMA and ROTC cadets, deemed too young to join the war against the Japanese, to flee into the mountains of Antipolo and organize themselves into one of the more effective guerrilla units that resisted the imperial rule of Japan. The film tells the story of the courage, determination and patriotism of this group through interviews with surviving Hunters ROTC members and their families and friends. With insightful commentators from noted Filipino World War II historians, the film narrates the story of the resistance fighters whose role in the liberation of the Philippines is mostly forgotten and largely left out of history textbooks.\nWith the documentary, PVB and Spyron-AV Manila hope to challenge today’s youth to rise to the occasion for the sake of the country, the same way the Hunters ROTC did in 1942 after the defeat of Filipino and American defense units at Japanese hands.\nThe producers of the film also plan to show “Unsurrendered 2” in schools and universities to ensure kids not only associate the liberation of the country with Gen. Douglas MacArthur but also know the important contributions of Miguel Ver, Terry Adevoso, Gustavo Ingles, Frisco San Juan, Emmanuel de Ocampo, and the thousands of other Filipino resistance fighters.\n• • •\nVICE GOV.

Fernando, 2015 Outstanding Local Legislator\nBulacan Vice Governor Daniel Fernando was honored anew as Outstanding Local Legislator for 2015 by the Superbrand Marketing International, Inc.

It was conferred by SMI President & CEO Harry Tambuatco and Senior Marketing Manager Kenneth Rocete.\nTambuatco said the former actor-turned-public servant was given the award for his notable and meritorious programs and projects such as the Damayang Filipino; Pangkabuhayan Mo, Sagot Ko, Paunlarin Mo; Dunong Filipino Legal Mission, Dugong Alay ng Bulakenyo; Damayang Filipino Computer on Wheels; and Call Center Training Program, among others.\nVice Governor Fernando was very grateful to receive the accolade considering that he has sacrificed his showbiz career in fulfilling his duties as a public servant.\n• • •\nTIDBITS : Happy b-day greetings today, Oct. 15, go to SM’s patriarch Henry Sy Sr., Justice Renato Corona, Paz Yuchengco, Leo Baluyot, Teresa Cabigao, Tessie Isidro, Mely Munoz, Billy Formoso, Mario Baluyot, Remy Go, Tessie Coronel, Dadang Sarao Virata, Rachel Castro-Barawid and Dante Ponce… Oct. 16: GMA’s Jimmy Duavit, Rosa Rosal, Sonny Alvarez, Dr. Pacita Gonzalez, Cathy Babao, Eden Arias, Fe Aurora Castro, Cynthia Sullivan (a.k.a.
