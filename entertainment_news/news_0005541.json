Rick rallied the troops to put a plan into action to try and move the hordes of walkers away from them. \nDuring the planning stages Rick realised that Carter (Ethan Embry) was beginning to put his own plan into action to overthrow him. After the two exchanged tense words, Carter agreed to toe the line but he met an untimely end during the walker operation when he was bitten. Rick put him out of his misery as Morgan looked on. \nThe next episode of the season is JSS. Just when it looks like things can return to normal, or as normal as things can be in the apocalypse, a new problem arises for the Alexandrians. \nTune in to FOX HD at 9pm on Monday to see the episode.
