A 90-minute special airing in January takes the characters back in time to 1890s London, the original setting of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tales. Television has mined Doyle's detective tales for inspiration for many shows: Hide Caption 1 of 7 7 photos: TV shows inspired by Sherlock Holmes \"House\" creator David Shore has acknowledged that the cantankerous and drug-addicted doctor who solved all manner of medical mysteries was based in part on detective Holmes. Even the character and series name played off of Holmes, \"although he was kinder than House,\" Shore told the University of Toronto magazine . Hide Caption 2 of 7 7 photos: TV shows inspired by Sherlock Holmes \"Elementary,\" my dear Watson. The phrase is familiar to even the casual reader of Holmes tales. In this case, Watson is Joan Watson, played by Lucy Liu. She's sidekick to Johnny Lee Miller's modern-day Sherlock, who has jumped the pond to New York City. Hide Caption 3 of 7 7 photos: TV shows inspired by Sherlock Holmes \"Backstrom\" is based on a series of novels by Swedish criminologist Leif G.W. Persson. The character Everett Backstrom, right, played by Rainn Wilson, has more in common with \"House\" than Holmes -- he's pretty rude and his personal life is a mess, but he's a gifted detective. Hide Caption 4 of 7 7 photos: TV shows inspired by Sherlock Holmes In \"Forever,\" Holmes-inspired character Dr. Henry Morgan's biggest mystery is himself. Played by Ioan Gruffudd, Morgan is a medical examiner who spends each episode investigating causes of death while simultaneously attempting to figure out the key to his immortality -- and how to end it. Oh yeah, he's 200 years old. Hide Caption 5 of 7 7 photos: TV shows inspired by Sherlock Holmes \"Psych\" teams up two investigators played by James Roday, center, and Dulé Hill, left. Though his cases can get a little out of hand, Roday's Sherlock-ish character Shawn Spencer is an especially good detective. He's so good that he manages to convince the cops that he's psychic. His unorthodox methods lend lots of comedy to this detective drama. Hide Caption 6 of 7 7 photos: TV shows inspired by Sherlock Holmes Simon Baker's \"Mentalist\" character Patrick Jane purported in the past to have psychic powers. After renouncing his claim to extrasensory perception, Jane worked as a law enforcement consultant to solve crimes using his well-honed observational skills. The twist: He wants to investigate the murder of his own family. Hide Caption 7 of 7 (CNN) Two mysteries surrounding BBC One's \"Sherlock\" television special were solved on Saturday: title and air date. Trifling details to you, maybe, but not to fans of the hit series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, which takes place in present-day England. The 90-minute special, \"The Abominable Bride,\" brings the characters back in time to 1890s London, the original setting of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock tales. It will stand apart from Season 4, which is scheduled to start production this spring, according to BBC One. And, for the first time in the series' run, the special will air on the same day -- January 1 -- in the United States (on \"Masterpiece Mystery\" on PBS, 9 p.m. ET) and the United Kingdom (BBC One). Fans celebrated the news, especially those in the U.S., who typically have to wait until after the show airs in the UK to get their fix.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:04:56.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
