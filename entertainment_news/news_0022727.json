Tracy Morgan has made his return to sand-up comedy more than a year after he was seriously injured in a deadly bus crash. Morgan, who suffered a traumatic brain injury that left him in a coma for eight days, performed two shows in Manhattan Monday night. The 46-year-old comedian tweeted about his performance at Greenwich Village’s Comedy Cellar to his more than 3 million followers, saying he was “picking up the pieces.” My first time on stage in 16 Months at the #ComedyCellar !

A photo posted by The Stand NYC (@thestandnyc) on Oct 12, 2015 at 7:14pm PDT Morgan is still recovering from injuries sustained in the June 7, 2014 accident when a Wal-Mart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into the back of a limousine-bus carrying the former \"30 Rock\" star and others who were returning from a comedy show in Delaware. Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken leg, and broken ribs in the crash. Comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair of Peekskill, a mentor of Morgan's, was killed. Three other passengers in the limo suffered serious injuries. Young Mother Shot Dead Outside NYC Nightclub, 2 Others Hurt The National Transportation Safety Board determined the truck driver, Kevin Roper, of Jonesboro, Georgia, had been awake for 28 hours before the crash. Roper faces several criminal charges, including death by auto, in state court. He has pleaded not guilty. He wasn't a defendant in Morgan's federal lawsuit. Meanwhile, Walmart has settled a $10 million lawsuit with McNair’s children and has reached a confidential settlement with Morgan. Morgan will make a televised comeback to “Saturday Night Live” as host this week.
