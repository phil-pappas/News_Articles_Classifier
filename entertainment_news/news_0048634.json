Image 8 of 8 Paul Prudhomme in Houston: a look back 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Houston has a much documented culinary relationship with New Orleans. So I feel certain that I wasn't the only foodie in H-Town sad to hear of the passing of Paul Prudhomme .\nI wondered too what links, if any, he had to Houston. My cursory digging didn't turn up much other than the fact that Latin Bites ' Roberto Castre worked in Prudhomme's kitchen.\nThe man who is credited with popularizing Cajun cuisine (and, in the process, nearly causing the extinction of redfish) did visit Houston several times during his celebrity chef hey-day.\nOf course, his influence can be seen (and tasted) at Houston restaurants. (Have you tried the blackened catfish enchiladas at Danton's ?)\nPrudhomme launched his career at Commander's Palace in New Orleans. When he left to open his now famous K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in 1982, Commander's Palace replaced him with a then-unknown Emeril Lagasse.\nAnother bit of trivia: Prudhomme trademarked the Turducken.\nIn 1989 told People magazine:\n\"I'd weigh 120 pounds and I'd be gorgeous and I'd be a gigolo. I love women, every kind in existence. Even women who don't like to eat because I can change their whole life in an instant. You put something in front of them that they can't stop eating, and boy, you got somebody's heart. I mean, you can start fooling around immediately - with complete power.\"\nCheck out the slideshow above to see photos of Prudhomme's visits to Houston.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758174/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758180/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758176/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.latinbitescafe.com/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758171/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.nola.com/dining/index.ssf/2015/10/paul_prudhomme_dies.html#incart_maj-story-2", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758176/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758171/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758175/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758172/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758172/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758179/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758180/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758175/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758179/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.dantonsseafood.com/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/16/8758174/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:32:48.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
