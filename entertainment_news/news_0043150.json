As informed earlier, I will be doing a film in his production next year,” said Charan. Giving a sneak peek into his projects, the actor confirmed that he would be starring in the Telugu remake of the Tamil blockbuster, Thani Oruvan. Charan, who was last seen in the 2014 film Govindudu Andarivadele, also that he would be launching two production houses and had a packed calendar – both as actor and producer – in 2016. “My next film is Thani Oruvan remake and Surender Reddy is the director. If everything falls into place, I will be doing a film with Gautham Menon in 2016. I will also be starting two production houses – Konidela Productions and White Horse Entertainments,” Charan said. One of the biggest draws of Bruce Lee is the fact that his father megastar Chiranjeevi will be featuring in a cameo. Charan, who will be producing Chiranjeevi’s 150th film, says he wasn’t the first choice for the cameo. “We needed someone to play himself in a cameo. Initially we zeroed in on another actor but things dint work out. Srinu Vaitla (Bruce Lee’s director) then approached dad with the cameo,” Charan added. Produced by DVV Danayya, Bruce Lee is slated to hit screens on Oct 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:31:36.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
