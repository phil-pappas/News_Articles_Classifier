One of Rochester’s jobs that night was to stop speedy forward Roy Lassiter. Nineteen years later, the Rhinos will try to do the same thing in Friday night’s USL Championship at Sahlen’s Stadium against the Los Angeles Galaxy II.\nStop Lassiter.\nRoy’s son, Ariel, is a 21-year-old rookie forward and the top scorer for the Galaxy II. He scored 11 times in 21 regular-season matches and has three more playoff goals for the No. 5 seeds, who won three road matches to capture the Western Conference and earn the right to face the Rhinos (19-1-10), the top seeds in the East.\nLast year, L.A. (17-11-3) ousted the visiting Rhinos, 2-1, in the quarterfinals before losing in the semifinals to eventual champion, Sacramento. The Galaxy avenged that with a 1-0 victory in the opening round, then Lassiter had both goals in a 2-0 upset at No. 1 Orange County before converting on first goal in the seventh minute in a 2-1 win at No. 2 OKC Energy FC.\n“He has the same type of pace, same type of appetite to score and get in behind,” Rhinos coach Bob Lilley said, comparing Lassiter to his father.\nRoy, who had 30 appearances with the U.S. national team, played for Tampa, D.C., Miami and Kansas City in seven MLS seasons (88 goals). His 27 goals in 1996, when Tampa scored a blistering 66, is still a single-season MLS record. He did score in that Cup match in Rochester in 1996, but the Rhinos rallied. Lassiter faced the Rhinos the next year, too, when Tampa got revenge with a 1-0 win at Frontier. He also played against them in 2003 after joining Virginia Beach (A-League).\nHis son was born in Costa Rica, like Roy, but grew up in California. At 5-foot-10, 155 pounds, he’s two inches taller than his father.\n“Every time I’ve seen him he looks better, looks more confident. He’s reading runs earlier, bending them,” Lilley said. “As he gets older, the sophistication of his runs will get better and L.A. has players who can deliver those through balls to him.”\nSunday’s goal was an easy put away after OKC failed to clear a 35-yard free kick into the middle of the box. The second goal (21st minute) was also off a restart, as Andre Auras drilled a 28-yard free kick into the upper left corner. He has four goals and four assists.\nLassiter’s running mate is Jack McBean (6 goals/5 assists) and midfielder Raul Mendiola (4/8) is another key attacking piece for a squad that ranked 13th in the 24-team USL in goals with 39, one behind the Rhinos. L.A. was tied for third in goals allowed with 31.\nGalaxy II coach Curt Onalfo was a teammate with Ariel’s father with D.C. United in the late 1990s. Ariel made the Big West Conference’s All-Freshman team last fall for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo before turning pro, signing with a club in Sweden. He has played for the U.S. and Costa Rican Under-23 national teams, so he’s still eligible to play for either senior national team. Once he plays for one, he can’t play for any other.\nLassiter, who played in one match with L.A.'s MLS team, and the Galaxy II will be facing the USL’s top defense. The Rhinos had 17 shutouts and allowed only 15 goals. Goalkeeper Brandon Miller set a league record with 13 shutouts and has blanked both playoff foes, including Louisville City FC, the USL’s top team with 55 goals.\n“We’re going to have to do a good job with Lassiter’s pace. He’s lively,” said Lilley, whose defense held the league’s top scorer, Louisville’s Matt Fondy, scoreless in three matchups this season and without a shot in Saturday’s 1-0 playoff win.\nJDIVERON@Gannett.com\nUSL Championship\nMatchup: Rochester Rhinos (19-1-10) vs. L.A.
