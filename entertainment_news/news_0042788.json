The 42-year-old author will reportedly appear in the upcoming sixth season of the reality TV series, but she will not be coming back to the show full-time. Us Weekly reports that the mother of two has taped her scenes for the next installment of the Bravo hit. \"She'll pop up here and there,\" a so-called insider tells the site, adding, \"But by no means will she be on full time.\" Another source explains why the producers bring Glanville back to the show. \"Producers brought her back to bring in some drama and liven things up,\" the source dishes. During her time on the show, the former model had been clashing with co-stars Eileen Davidson and Lisa Vanderpump . Glanville, who was married to actor Eddie Cibrian from 2001-2010, announced her departure from \"RHOBH\" in June. \"After a lot of careful thought and deliberation, I have decided not to return to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" she said in her podcast at the time. She also hinted at her occasional appearance as adding, \"And if I'm available and they need me, they know how to find me. We'll see.\" Following Glanville's exit, the show added Kathryn Edwards, the ex-wife of NFL legend Marcus Allen, and singer Erika Jayne to the cast. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:38.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
