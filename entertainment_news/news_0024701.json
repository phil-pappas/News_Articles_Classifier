The participants also had the choice to choose “I don’t have an option” to each of the food items.\nBased on both experiments, the researchers concluded bitter taste preferences were linked to malevolent personality traits.\n“General bitter taste preferences emerged as a robust predictor for Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and everyday sadism,” the researchers said.\nFor people with sadistic traits, the consumption of bitter foods was comparable to a rollercoaster ride, where they enjoyed things that induced fear, according to Sagioglou.\nThe study was published in the journal Appetite.\n 14, 2015 8:20 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:31:39.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
