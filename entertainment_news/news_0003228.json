This is a surprise to his rock star ex Marianne (Tilda Swinton), who is recovering from vocal surgery, and her boyfriend Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts). A Bigger Splash (Fox Searchlight) \nAt one point in the movie, Ralph breaks into a wild dance to the classic Rolling Stones hit – which he performs with complete abandon. \nHe revealed: “It was always set that Harry did a number, spontaneously, to Emotional Rescue. That was always on the page, and it said he dances well, so I – yikes.” (Joel Ryan/Invision) \nThe 52-year-old explained: “I worked with a fantastic woman… who just kind of released me. I knew I needed someone to just help me get there, and I found her because I saw some work we did in the theatre. \n“It’s amazing what you can get everyone to do with a good movement person. Everyone has within them the potential to express something with their body to music. It’s a question of confidence and support.” Promoted stories (Joel Ryan/AP) \nThe training left him so confident in his dance skills that he busted some hilarious moves on the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival. \n— Biennale di Venezia (@la_Biennale) September 6, 2015 \nThe movie also contains a fair amount of nudity – and Ralph said he was actually very comfortable with this. \nHe explained: “It’s on the page, and as long as Luca (Guadagnino) wasn’t going crazy with the wrong kind of close-ups, I was okay with it.” \nIt’s very hard to know if you’re playing scenes, what they’re carrying,” he continued. “You think it might be saying the things you want it to say, but often it’s not… (Andrew Medichini/AP) \n“Sometimes scenes that are finely edited and have a heat to them, often feel quite awkward or technical when you do them. \n“There were often moments where I felt that the tension of Harry pressing on Marianne – I felt that we got that. I can remember it felt like we seemed to need to be getting into that.” \nThe film takes place against the background of the migrant crisis – but focuses on the story of famous Marianne and the rest of her wealthy cohort. \nAsked whether audiences will relate to the story, Ralph said: “I don’t know if they will.” \nHe explained: “It’s always concerned me, because here are four privileged people on an island and there’s a background of the refugees from North Africa coming, and I do think some people might think, why should I care about these people? \n“But I would hope that the emotional dynamic is one that everyone can relate to. Frustrations in love, desire, parents, children – so I think although they are a particular set of people, I think the heart of it is a human situation that people will recognise.” Share article \nA Bigger Splash is released in cinemas on February 12 2016.
