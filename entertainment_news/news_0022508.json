Originally commissioned in 2013 by the Farnsworth Art Museum for its strategic alliance with New York City’s Lincoln Center Education, this production is in partnership with the Farnsworth with support from the Maine Community Foundation. \nIn “Three Chekhov Vaudevilles,” Everyman Repertory Theatre performs a comic collection of short plays written by Russian writer Anton Chekhov, adapted and translated by multi-Tony Award winner Michael Frayn. These lively, laugh-out-loud shorts celebrate the foibles and eccentricities of human nature. Written in the late 1800s as farces or “jokes,” “The Bear,” “The Evils of Tobacco” and “The Proposal “feature a wide variety of recognizable characters who find themselves in the throes of absurd misunderstandings and intentions gone awry. \nReferencing the early vaudeville years of this country, the production mirrors a troupe of turn-of-the-century American immigrants performing light summer entertainment in a beautiful hall. Interludes will include Middle Eastern dancing (belly dancing), and the performers will be offering spectators a choice of free toasting shots: vodka, fruit juice or water. The seven roles are performed by Jennifer Hodgson, Paul Hodgson and David Troup, and dancers include Sarah Karp. \nThe production is being directed by Jeri Pitcher with stage design by John Bielenberg, lighting design by Tom Sadowski, costume design by Anna-Marlies Myers and stage management by John Whiteside. The show’s poster was designed by Rafi Baeza. \nAdvance reservations for “Three Chekhov Vaudevilles” are $20 for adults, $10 for students; adult tickets purchased at the door will be subject to an additional $5 fee. As a special Halloween incentive, all attendees wearing a costume to the Oct. 31 performance will get a special $10 ticket. Advance tickets are available at Owl & Turtle and HAV II in Camden; Grasshopper Shop in Rockland; and Bella Books in Belfast. Tickets also may be purchased online at everymanrep.org or by phone at 236-0173. \nEveryman Repertory Theatre's mission is to present high quality, creative and engaging theater for Midcoast people of all ages through the efforts of a corps of professional actors, designers and directors who live and work in Maine, while seeking to collaborate with local community and nonprofit arts organizations to increase accessibility to the widest possible audience. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
