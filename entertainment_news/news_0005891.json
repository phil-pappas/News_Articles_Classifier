Happy Rex Manning Day!\nTwenty years ago Tuesday, the comedy-drama “ Empire Records ” was released in movie theaters across America.\nAlthough the film only grossed $303,841 at the box office, it achieved cult status across multiple generations.\nSet in an independent record store facing permanent closure, “Empire Records” remains to some a beloved coming-of-age film about friendship, being true to oneself, music and standing up to authority.\nThe leading stars of the film also became fixtures in Hollywood, as fans continue to follow their every move.\nHere is a list of those who have since kept dancing to the beat of their own drum since appearing in the film:\nJack Plunkett/Jack Plunkett/Invision/AP Actress Liv Tyler is a mother of two boys - Milo Langdon and Sailor Gardner. Chris Pizzello/Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP Renée Zellweger recently came under fire due to rumors of plastic surgery. Arthur Mola/Arthur Mola/Invision/AP Ethan Embry's birth name is Ethan Randall. Andy Kropa/Andy Kropa/Invision/AP Debi Mazar starred in some of music icon Madonna's music videos and did her makeup as well. Previous Next Enlarge Liv Tyler — as Corey Mason\nDaughter of Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, Liv Tyler was one of the breakout stars of “Empire Records.”\nTyler, along with her goody two-shoes character, Corey Mason in the movie, became a teenage style icon and sex symbol.\nFrom her rise to stardom in the 1990s, Tyler acted in a wide range of films and television series, such as “That Thing You Do!,” “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, “The Incredible Hulk” and “The Leftovers.”\nThe actress and mother of two recently spoke out against ageism in Hollywood .\nRenée Zellweger — as Gina\nBefore her leading lady roles in the “Bridget Jones” movies and “Jerry Maguire,” Renée Zellweger found her footing as Gina, Empire Records’ resident party girl.\nZellweger’s name is certainly recognized in Hollywood circles, having climbed the ladder to gain career-defining roles in movies such as “Chicago,” “Nurse Betty,” “Me, Myself & Irene,” and “White Oleander.”\nShe is also an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe and Critics’ Choice Movie Awards winner for Best Supporting Actress in the 2003 war drama, “Cold Mountain,” and a Golden Globe Award winner for her roles in the movies “Nurse Betty” and “Chicago.”\nComing out in 2016, the actress is set to entertain viewers in another crowd-pleasing Bridget Jones movie based on the book, “Bridget Jones’s Baby.”\nEthan Embry — as Mark\nEthan Embry was a successful child actor who designed a good film and television career for himself.\nAfter “Empire Records,” Embry shared his acting prowess in other classic, generation-defining movies such as “Can’t Hardly Wait” and “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.”\nThe entertainer has not slowed down in adding to his already impressive resume.\nIn 2015, he portrayed two pivotal characters in two very influential television shows — Carter in “The Walking Dead” and Coyote Bergstein in Netflix’s “ Grace and Frankie .”\nDebi Mazar — as Jane\nQueens-born, Manhattan-bred Debi Mazar is close friends with legendary pop music icon Madonna and hosts a culinary television series, “ Extra Virgin ,” with her husband on the Cooking Channel.\nIt may seem as though the actress has had a privileged upbringing, but has otherwise worked hard for several decades in the entertainment business.\nAfter acting in two of director Spike Lee’s most controversial, “Malcolm X” and “Jungle Fever,” “Empire Records” was the movie that put Mazar on a path to a golden acting career.\nShe currently stars as Maggie in the praised TV Land series, “ Younger .”\nEric Charbonneau/Eric Charbonneau/Invision/AP Rory Cochrane attended the LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts in New York City. Jordan Strauss/Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Robin Tunney starred in the CBS Network television show, \"The Mentalist.\" Richard Shotwell/Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Johnny Whitworth was born on Halloween in 1975. Previous Next Enlarge Rory Cochrane — as Lucas\nLucas is the lovable, well-meaning nighttime manager of Empire Records, played by the convincing Rory Cochrane.\nWith a familiar face, Cochrane cornered his talent and luck in securing plum gigs in movies such as “A Scanner Darkly,” also starring Robert Downey Jr., Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, “Argo,” “Oculus” and “Black Mass.”\nThe performer has also enjoyed a long run in the television series “CSI:Miami” as character Tim Speedle.\nRobin Tunney — as Debra\nFor some, Robin Tunney’s name may not sound like a household name.\nBut, fans of the actress her in roles as Sarah Bailey in the horror-fantasy movie “ The Craft ” or as Veronica Donovan in the television show “ Prison Break ” will cosign for the star otherwise.\nHowever, it can be argued that Tunney’s breakout role was in “Empire Records” as suicidal record store employee Debra.\nPost-“Empire Records” fame, the thespian consistently worked in front of the camera.\nHer latest film, the biographical drama “ My All American ,” premieres in early November of 2015.\nJordan Strauss/Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Anthony LaPaglia won a Tony Award for Best Actor in 1998. Dan Steinberg/AP Maxwell Caulfield appeared in the movie \"Grease 2\" as Michael Carrington. Previous Next Enlarge Johnny Whitworth — as A.J.\nLike his “Empire Records” co-star Liv Tyler, Johnny Whitworth was arguably marketed as one of the movie’s male sex symbols both on and off screen.\nAnyone familiar with the heartache of unrequited love related to his “Empire Records” character, A.J., who endlessly pined away for Corey’s affection, played by Tyler.\nWhitworth’s sex appeal is still undeniable — one of his most recent roles in the NBC drama series “Blindspot” is credited as “ Ruggedly Handsome Man .”\nAnthony LaPaglia — as Joe Reaves\nThe Australian born actor has a steady on-camera career before appearing in “Empire Records” as the cool, yet blunt store manager Joe.\nAfter “Empire Records,” LaPaglia starred in a number of hit television shows, including “Frasier” and “Without a Trace.”\nMaxwell Caulfield — as Rex Manning\nThe 1980s pop idol Rex Manning was the wedge that came between both Liv Tyler and Renée Zellweger’s characters in “Empire Records.”\nMaxwell Caulfield, as Manning, depicted his character with accurate conviction.\nNot only did his performance in “Empire Records” help seal further acting opportunities for the entertainer, but there is also a real Rex Manning Day (April 8), just like the one seen in the movie, to commemorate the fictional recording artist.\ncsmith@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories `The Walking Dead' draws almost 20 million viewers 'Prison Break' 'kind of sequel' in the works from Fox ‘Grace and Frankie’ creator credits Miley Cyrus for renewal Liv Tyler, Steven Tyler duet in touching Instagram video Tags: lists , news break , liv tyler , renee zellwegger , debi mazar , robin tunney , anthony lapaglia , maxwell caulfield", "external_links": ["http://time.com/3813747/rex-manning-day-empire-records-april-8/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ilana-rapp/nbcs-blindspot-actor-john_b_8147914.html", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250/awards", "http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/shows/extra-virgin.html", "http://tvline.com/2015/08/06/prison-break-revival-fox-official-2016/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112950", "http://variety.com/2015/film/news/liv-tyler-actresses-second-class-citizens-ageism-sexism-1201600647/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115963", "http://www.motelrocks.com/blog/post.php?s=2013-07-17-style-crush-90s-liv-tyler", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3719896", "http://deadline.com/2015/04/younger-renewed-season-2-tv-land-1201413328/", "https://www.thewrap.com/jane-fonda-lily-tomlin-speak-out-on-grace-and-frankie-salary-controversy/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:58:41.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
