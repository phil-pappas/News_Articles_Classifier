ANDERSON The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Bopping his head to the beat and swaying to a blues version of “America the Beautiful,” President Barack Obama on Wednesday night celebrated what he called one of the country’s most precious gifts: “American creativity.” \nObama and his wife, Michelle, marked the history of American music during the latest installment of the PBS television program “In Performance at the White House.” The president also noted the 50th anniversary of the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities. \n“Creativity, it’s always played a central role in the life of our nation,” Obama said. “It’s our artists who hold up a mirror to our society, reminding us of our common purpose and our collective obligations.” \nObama said American music is grounded in stories of real people and that lyrics share the tales of hometowns and the hood, love and heartbreak.
