Park St. in Arlington Heights.\n\"The Church believes every creature is important,\" Grossnickle said. \"The love we give to a pet, and receive from a pet, can draw us more deeply into the larger circle of life, into the wonder of our common relationship to our Creator.\"\nThe ceremony called the Blessing of Pets is taking place this weekend at churches and elsewhere across the country in remembrance of St. Francis of Assisi's love for all creatures. The celebration of St. Francis' feast day is Oct. 4.\nAll pets are welcome to the blessing.
