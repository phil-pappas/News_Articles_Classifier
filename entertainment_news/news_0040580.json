I was having a cup of coffee you know, there's not much on is there? So you're flicking channels and I did come across what we call nowadays 'accidental porn'. But as they were doing a 'Midsummer's Night Dream' I figured it was OK!\" \nThe subject was a topic on the programme and the former 'EastEnders' star - who was joined on the panel by Ruth Langsford, Andrea McLean and Linda Robinson - gawped at the fact that one in three young women now admits to watching porn at least once a week. \nAsked whether she knew anyone who watched it regularly, Anita said: \"Well I don't know - I don't go round asking people whether they watch porn! And I don't actually watch it every week, but nowadays you can put the TV on and there's Sexcetera (TV channel) and there's naked bodies, you know randomly just on.\" anita dobson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:51:21.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
