Think of it as dinner and a show. \n\"This is theater for our restaurants,\" said R.C. Schmidt, whose many restaurant holdings started with RC's Bar in 1974. \nOn Nov. 11, 1987, Schmidt opened the original Water Street Brewery at 1101 N. Water St. He's since followed up with three more — Delafield, Grafton and, most recently, Oak Creek. \nAt each, Schmidt has added a sideshow of impressive vintage breweriana. The four locations display hundreds of brewery-related memorabilia items, from simple bottle openers to an ornate, hand-carved wooden sign for A. Schumacher's Potosi Lager Beer dating back to 1886. \nSprinkled among the brewpubs are: \n■ 50,000 vintage beer cans; of those, 6,000 are arranged alphabetically in 25 wood-framed displays \n■ 1,300 beer tap knobs and handles \n■ 2,300 coasters \n■ 825 bottle and can openers, some displayed in wood frames \n■ 25 original brewing history lithographs \n■ 250 server trays \n■ 450 large and miniature beer bottles \n■ 40 exterior corner signs \n■ 100 neon signs \n\"We go to these auctions,\" Schmidt said. \"You don't know this stuff exists.\" \nHe didn't know this stuff existed before he needed décor for his first brewpub. He does now. Schmidt has been collecting for so long, people often come to him. While renovating an old building, a man found a partial wall highlighting the Schlitz Brewery in mosaic tiles and asked Schmidt if he wanted to buy it. Schmidt jumped at the offer. A doctor from Vermont sold Schmidt 50 Wisconsin beer trays he had collected. \nEarly on, Schmidt made the decision to collect only Wisconsin breweriana and to focus on pre-Prohibition items, Schmidt said. \nHis newest brewpub, at 140 W. Town Square Way in Oak Creek, welcomes diners with a one-of-a-kind overhead Pabst sign and a backroom decorated with vintage corner signs — the type that bars would place at the front door so patrons could see the brewery name from either side of the corner. \nThe Grafton location, 2615 Washington St., concentrates on vintage pieces from northern Wisconsin breweries, such as signs from the former Hochgreve Brewery in Green Bay and Storck Beer from Slinger. \nThe Delafield brewpub, 3191 Golf Road, is the keeper of the wooden Potosi sign along with a Potosi neon sign, part of the large can collection, large-scale neon signs and a tap knob display. \nMiller Brewing artifacts are the most difficult to find, Schmidt said, and he's saved at least one of them for the flagship location downtown. That's where diners will find industrial lithographs from Blatz, Schlitz, Pabst and Miller. \n\"It is the beer capital of the world,\" he said. \nThe lithographs were created in the early industrial era and were a way for brewery owners to boost sales and boast a little bit, said Matt Schmidt, director of operations. \n\"You want to show off your prowess,\" Matt Schmidt said of the lithograph's intention. \nHe often joins R.C. in the hunt at auctions. A few of R.C.'s biggest finds come from the Herb and Helen Haydock collection, part of which was housed at the former Oldenberg Brewery in Kentucky. More of the Wisconsin Rapids couple's belongings are at Minhas Brewery in Monroe. \nDiners are offered the chance to learn about the collection one bite at a time. Each year, the Water Street Brewery menu highlights a piece of the memorabilia on the menu cover — menus, coincidentally, made to mimic the Green Sheet. \nSoon diners will be able to view the pieces as they might in a museum. Water Street Brewery plans to start a self-directed Beer Memorabilia Tour for its four locations in 2016. Visitors will get a brochure identifying pieces and the collectibles' history.
