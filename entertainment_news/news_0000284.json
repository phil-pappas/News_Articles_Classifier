Comment Andre.lamar@doverpost.com@302DoAndre Posted Oct. 1, 2015 @ 4:00 am If you missed the X Ambassadors at June’s Firefly Music Festival, you can catch the band in a free concert in Dover this weekend. The alternative rock band will play Sunday on Victory Plaza at Dover International Speedway before the AAA 400 NASCAR Spring Cup Series race. Lead singer Sam Harris will sing the national anthem prior to the start of the race. X Ambassadors have spent the last two summers rocking the Firefly Music Festival at the Woodlands and headlined the Backyard Stage this year. The New York-based group is currently on tour with their new album, “VHS,” and inspirational hit single, “Renegades.” The music video features clips of people with disabilities working to overcome their challenges. Harris spoke to the Milford Beacon about how he’ll sing the national anthem on Sunday, confederate flags in NASCAR, and the band’s love for Firefly. Growing up, did you ever think you’d be singing the national anthem before a NASCAR race? I can honestly say no. I did not ever picture myself doing that [laughs]. How did this opportunity come about? We had met some people through NASCAR who said they were fans of the band. We’re pretty busy right now and we’re constantly on tour. We just got a call while we were on tour saying we had been offered to [sing the national anthem]. So I had to record a version of it on my own in like a dressing room, somewhere, and send it to them just so they could make sure I wasn’t going to sing it off pitch or anything. Some singers have really botched it. Do you have any idea how that happens? I’m just going to kind of do it straightforward. I think, hopefully, that will work in my favor. Probably where people mess up is when they try to get too creative with it. It’s a powerful song, you know. You just have to sing it. Do you have a favorite NASCAR driver? I really admire Jeff Gordon for what he just did recently: buying that car with the confederate flag on it and painting over it. I thought that was a really bold thing that he did and it made a statement. I have my own issues with people still waving the confederate flag at NASCAR events. I hope that stops soon. I know NASCAR people are working on trying to ban it from all events. But I think what Jeff Gordon did spoke really loudly, and that was really cool. What was it like playing the last two Firefly festivals? I can safely say it’s our favorite festival to play in the U.S. It’s been an all-around good experience. The festival is run really well and the crowds are always awesome. This year we headlined one of the stages and we had a huge crowd. Is there anything else that distinguishes Firefly from other major festivals? Because it’s a young festival, there’s an energy there; it’s not played out. People are still coming to the festival site to see what it’s all about. They haven’t heard too many stories from other people saying like, “This year was nothing compared to the Firefly of like [the first, second or third year].” Did you think “Renegades” was going to be a smash hit? None of us had any idea. I think it kind of goes to show you never know when your hit is going to come. The ones that we all thought were going to be big hits weren’t [laughs], and the one we didn’t even expect to do anything did it the most. The music video highlights your bandmate and brother, Casey Harris, who is blind. How much does Casey inspire you guys to be renegades? All the time. He’s been a renegade himself. If you knew him when we were kids, Casey was the most rebellious out of all of us. What did he do? He was kind of a troublemaker in school [laughs]. That’s all I’ll say.
