As usual Jason’s responses were fascinating. He is so knowledgeable l and passionate about his work. Here are his responses: 1. Is the musical score you are performing for the upcoming \"Nosferatu\" an original score you composed? If it is, can you tell us a little about how it came about? If not, can you discuss the score and where it is from and why you chose it? The original musical score for Nosferatu was composed by Hans Erdmann for orchestra. However, most of the score has been lost, and what was left has been filled in by others. The score I am using for my performances is a study in film compiling by myself and my colleague, Noel Jones of Frog Music Press . Mr. Jones and I are collaborating on a series of silent film scores for organists, based upon the original style of silent film accompanying from the era. During the silent film era, dozens of publishing companies created folios of \"mood music\" for use in film accompaniment. Unfortunately, most of these folios were thrown away after 'talkies' began. We found a couple of these folios and are utilizing selections from those. In addition, we are also using some appropriate organ, piano and orchestral selections, and transcribing them for organ. One thing I add to the compiled selections is improvisation between selections to emphasis a scene. A great thing about live film accompaniment is the score will never be the same each time it is performed. Each performance depends on the audience reactions, the atmosphere of the surroundings, seeing a different idiosyncrasy of the scene, and more. 2. Can you talk a bit about your love of movies and specifically how your passion for playing music scores came about? I've always been interested in theatre organs and their music. The theatre organs were designed, quite differently from classical church organs, to accompany films and entertain by playing popular music for the masses. It was designed to replace the theatre orchestras so theatre managers would only pay one musician instead of a dozen or more; the first musical form of \"efficiency\". I only recently came to the silent films. However, I had seen a couple silent films when I was younger, and found them interesting. Once Mr. Jones started discussing this project with me I really got into it, especially once I saw how excited audiences were with them. 3. What is favorite modern film score and why? The silent film era of film accompaniment and today's modern film scores are radically different. My favorite film scores today are those by the incomparable John Williams . Every score he writes is different with unique melodies and harmonies, while at the same time stepping back and letting the actors and the scripts take the spotlight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:37:53.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
