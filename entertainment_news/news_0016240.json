Rowling's gruesome new crime novel gave her nightmares. \nListen to first chapter Harry Potter returns in new J.K. Rowling play Lord Voldemort was the dark wizard of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. He-who-must-not-be-named killed the Potter parents and left Harry with the lightning-bolt shaped scar that marked him for life.\nBut he's almost a kitten compared to Rowling's new fictional killer â€“ an unnamed psychopath who sends a dismembered limb in the post.\nJ.K. Rowling writes as Robert Galbraith. \nCareer of Evil is the author's newest crime book and her darkest to date, the research of which gave her \"nightmares\".\nAdvertisement The plot encompasses paedophilia, serial murder and Body Integrity Identity Disorder - the mental condition that makes sufferers want to amputate their healthy limbs.\nCalling it a \"scary book\", Rowling has said the grotesque storyline for Career of Evil disturbed her sleep for the first time in her writing career.\nThe novel, written under the nom de plume of Robert Galbraith, is the third in her acclaimed crime series, which she began in secret after she finished the Harry Potter series.\nAs with her first two crime novels, it stars private eye Cormoran Strike, a war veteran who lost his leg in Afghanistan, and his sidekick Robin Ellacott.\nPublished in Britain on Tuesday,  Career of Evil  signals its dark intent from the beginning - it's book's title and chapter headings are taken from the lyrics of the US heavy metal rock band Blue Oyster Cult. \nParts of the book are told from the perspective of the killer, with early reviews highlighting \"unspeakable and horrendous acts\". However, reviewer Jake Kerridge of London's Daily Telegraph  says Rowling's most realistic plot so far is not entirely convincing.\nRowling has said the book involved the most planning of anything she has written; no small feat given the strict plotting of the Potter books.\nEarlier this year, she told her Twitter followers: \"My research into the subject matter of Career of Evil literally gave me nightmares, which has never happened before. It's a scary book.\"\nThe novel has already spent 24 days in the Amazon presales bestseller list.\nCareer of Evil opens with Ellacott receiving a package through the post containing the severed leg of an unknown woman.\nThe plot hinges on the hunt for who is responsible, with Strike chasing the many people he fears may have a potentially fatal grudge against him.\nRowling is understood to have spoken to former servicemen about their experiences, as well as delving into the most disturbing of crimes.\nSpeaking at the Theakston's Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival, in North Yorkshire, last year, Rowling said she had planned the novel meticulously using \"colour-coded spreadsheets\". \"The planning is insane,\" she said. \"This is the best planned book I will ever have written.\"\nThe Cormoran Strike novels are due to be adapted into a television series by the BBC next year, and are expected to continue for at least seven instalments.\nThe first \"Galbraith\" novel, The Cuckoo's Calling , was published in April 2013 initially to little fanfare.\nAfter Rowling's solicitor leaked her name, the book leapt into the bestseller charts.\nThe Telegraph with Linda Morris", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:29:17.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
