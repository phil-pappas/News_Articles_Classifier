While his predecessors, Vishnuvardhan and Sudeep have made their presence felt in Bollywood and were seen in a couple of films, Diganth has strode miles ahead of them all by playing the lead in the upcoming film Wedding Pullav, releasing this week. \nThough his journey from the bylanes of Thirthahalli to Mumbai might seem like a dream to many aspiring actors, the latest sensation makes no secret of the struggle he has gone through. “Every success or failure I have faced during my struggle has shaped who I am today,” says the actor, adding that he has learned along the way how one must have an immense amount of patience. “I realised it with my Bollywood stint and it has only yielded in more films in Hindi,” he says. \nDiganth Diganth started with Fataak, which was supposed to be his first release, but due to certain technical issues, Wedding Pullav became his debut. “I also have two more projects - Jee Bharke Ji Le and Ticket to Bollywood in the pipeline,” he informs. \nThe young actor who has been going around promoting his film admits that he had to completely concentrate on his Bollywood outing which did not allow him to take offers that were coming to him from the Kannada industry. “Worse still, I had no time to promote my Kannada films - Parapancha, Sharp Shooter and Minchagi Ninu Baralu. But the makers of these films have been patiently waiting for my Hindi film to release. Everyone has cooperated and wished me luck,” says Diganth and adds, “Though I am trying to establish myself in Bollywood, I will not give up on Kannada films. Once a week, I get calls from Kannada directors, who want me to be a part of their project. However, I have decided to take up sensible subjects in both the languages,” says the actor, who intends to do two Kannada films a year and that’s one of the reasons he hasn’t settled in Mumbai. \nDiganth also reveals that his looks came to his advantage. “While I took eight to nine years of experience from Sandalwood, it was my personality that was an advantage apart from my dancing skills. I am also fluent in Hindi, so I think I was tailormade to be here,” he says. \nPaying a tribute to Sandalwood and everyone who assisted him, Diganth is arranging a special show for all his friends and associates this week in Bengaluru. “I am inviting all my directors with whom I have worked apart from all associates and friends,” he says. \nProduced by Shashi Ranjan and Anu Ranjan and directed by Binod Pradhan, the movie also stars their daughter Anushka Ranjan, TV serial actor Karan Grover and senior actor Rishi Kapoor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:11:34.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
