Associated Press Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015 | 5:13 p.m. \nLOS ANGELES â€” The SeaWorld marine park in San Diego will challenge a state commission ruling than banned the company from breeding its captive killer whales. \nThe announcement on Thursday comes a week after the California Coastal Commission endorsed a $100 million expansion of the tanks SeaWorld uses to hold orcas in San Diego. \nBut the ruling also outlined a series of restrictions on SeaWorld, including a ban on breeding the whales at the California park. It also prohibited the sale, trade or transfer of the whales. \nAnimal rights activists say the vote was a death blow to the use of killer whales at the California park. \nSeaWorld says the commission overstepped its authority and the decision has \"no legal basis.\" \nThe company says the federal government regulates the whales' care, not the commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:31:06.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
