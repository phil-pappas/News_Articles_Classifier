And the Sport leads the way again, with updated styling, new technology, more robust power train and engineering making it an even roomier, more comfortable and much better ride or drive experience.\nThe 2015 Ford Edge Sport is the top of the line with an MSRP of $38,100 for the front-wheel drive (FWD) with all-wheel drive (AWD), available on all five trims, for $1,400 more.\nThe Edge Sport stands out smartly in 2015 powered by the standard all-new 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine that produces 315 horsepower and 350 lb.-ft. of torque. Power is delivered to the road through the SelectShift six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and featuring two drive modes – Drive and Sport. Selecting Sport delivers more aggressive acceleration and deceleration for sportier performance.\nThe AWD is full-time and, with its electronically controlled clutch, moves power as needed (up to 100 percent) between front and rear wheels. Riding very smartly on the standard 20-inch wheels, the Edge Sport rides even more impressively on the optional 21-inch wheels.\nA new body structure for the 2015 Edge extensively uses high-strength steels. A redesigned and specially tuned suspension with MacPherson struts up front and a new integral-link independent with coil springs at the rear provides a more aggressive, yet comfortable ride. With the redesign incorporating high strength steel - the use of advanced noise suppression materials like acoustic glass and the Active Noise Cancellation technology in the new 2.7L EcoBoost engine, makes the 2015 Edge not only the most comfortable, best handling, but also the quietest Edge ever.\nEdge for 2015 is also a bit longer and taller than before. With interior design revisions and new generation thinner seating, the inside is roomier than before with over 40-inches of headroom and near 41-inches of legroom both front and rear. New configuration of the cockpit area and console allows for more incidental storage for personal and technology items. Behind the second row, there is a whopping 39.2 cubic feet of cargo space beneath the hands-free power tailgate. Folding down the second row, cargo space goes to an impressive 73.4 cubic feet.\nTesting the Edge Sport AWD\nWe recently spent a week in the larger, quieter and more powerful 2015 Ford Edge Sport AWD, very well equipped, and including the - unique to the Sport - Electric Spice Metallic exterior color (more about that later), with a MSRP of $40,095.\nSome of the standard equipment and features on our 2015 Edge Sport included Black Grille, LED Signature Lamps, LED Tail Lamps with Light Bar, Rear Spoiler and Power Heated Folding Side Mirrors with LED Signal and Approach Lamps. On the inside are 60/40 Easy Fold Second Row Seats, Dual Climate Control, Ambient Lighting, Eight Cupholders, Four Remote Power Points, Aluminum Pedals, Leather Trimmed Seating with Suede Seat Inserts, 10-Way Power Seat Adjust Driver and Passenger, Push Button Start, Rear View Camera, Reverse Sensing System and Hill-Start Assist.\nInfotainment is delivered through a Sony Premium Stereo with single CD using the 8-inch LCD Touchscreen in the center stack and includes Sync with MyFord Touch, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, SirusXM Satellite Navigation plus a variety of the most popular hands-free connectivity applications.\nPackages and Accessories\nOur test Edge Sport AWD came packaged with Equipment Group 401A ($3,700). It included a range of optional features and equipment including Voice Activated Navigation, Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure Warning, Remote Start, Enhanced Park Assist, Rain Sensing Wipers, Auto Dim Driver Exterior Mirror, Heated and Cooled Front Seats with Heated Rear Seats, Power Liftgate and a very useful 180-degree Forward Facing Camera with Washer.\nThe 21-inch Premium painted tarnished dark low-gloss aluminum wheels mounted with 265/40R21 summer tires added another $1,990.\nWith the segment exclusive Second Row Inflatable Seat Belts ($195) and delivery, our 2015 Ford Edge Sport AWD priced at $46,875.\nRide/Drive Impressions\nAlready one of the roomier CUV’s in its segment, the space inside the new 2015 Edge Sport is incredible. The new thinner seating is actually more comfortable and the cabin, with plenty of glass all-around, has great driver visibility. The sound mitigation on the new Edge delivers an exceptionally quiet cabin. We even noted much less noise coming from the road surface which Ford tells us is from, not only sound suppression materials, but also their selection of a quieter running tire for the Edge.\nThe new 2.7L EcoBoost with the Sport Mode and Paddle Shifters provides a spirited driver experience around town and on the highway. The Sport Suspension, AWD and optional 21-inch wheels make the ride higher and even more stable with greater control on the road. The new 180-degree Forward Camera and the Enhanced Park Assist make garage, parallel and perpendicular parking a snap.\nBuilding our own Sport\nAs with many vehicles we test, we would have added a couple of options to our 2015 Edge Sport to make it even better. With all of the great room inside the new Edge, the Panoramic Vista Sun Roof ($1,595), with its 47.7-inch span front-to-back would have further enhanced the ride experience. We were frankly disappointed that the Adaptive Cruise Control with collision warning and braking support required yet another package – the Driver Assist for $1,300. A crossover at this level should have had this as part of the Equipment Group 401A along the other driver assist features.\nThe Electric Spice Color\nLastly, though we really like the new 2015 Edge Sport, the Electric Spice Metallic exterior color does not excite us. Frankly, we struggled with it all week long. The Edge Sport would look much better in any of the other available colors. And while on the subject of color, please, why is only Black available for the Sport interior? The Ceramic or Cognac, available only on the Titanium trim-level, would be excellent interior matches for a couple of the other available exterior Sport colors like the White Platinum Metallic, Ruby Red Metallic or Bronze Fire Metallic.\nSetting our criticism of color aside, we love the new Edge and the Sport trim level in particular. It is a winner in any color but, for us, we would take the new 2015 Sport Edge in say, the new exterior Magnetic Metallic or Tuxedo Black Metallic with the Black interior.", "external_links": ["http://www.ford.com/crossovers/edge/"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:45:50.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
