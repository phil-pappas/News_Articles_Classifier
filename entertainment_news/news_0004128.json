Photo: ABC TV \nGina Riley made a dangerous decision last year. The co-creator of Kath & Kim (and their upper-class alter-egos Prue and Trude) decided she would start no new projects of her own and \"be a cork in a stream and just float along\", waiting to see what acting work might turn up.\nThis carefree approach paid off more quickly and more satisfyingly than she'd ever imagined, giving her two of the happiest jobs of her long career as a comedian, singer, writer, producer and actor.\nRiley found herself playing the mother of Josh's boyfriend in the third series of Josh Thomas's comedy Please Like Me and the mother of two troubled women in The Beautiful Lie , an ABC series that shifts the story of Anna Karenina from 19th-century Russia to 21st-century Melbourne.\nGina Riley, right, didn't seek work after her role with Jane Turner in Kath & Kim . \nRiley had read and loved the novel in her youth, so she was both excited and nervous about the invitation to help its transition to television.\nAdvertisement \"I read the script of the first episode and absolutely fell in love with it, so I was very keen to do it,\" she says. \n\"I had to audition, which I was happy to do because you want to know that you're all on the same page. Because I've come from such a different world, of comedy, I wanted to go in and meet everyone. I haven't done a lot of serious acting. It's what I wanted to do when I was very young, but I couldn't get arrested.\nGina Riley plays mother Donna in Please Like Me , here with Geoff Morrell as Bruce and Keegan Joyce as their son Arnold. Photo: ABC TV \n\"I suppose they were interested in me because Catherine has a bit of an edge to her. She is a little bit funny, very subtly. I think they wanted that to be played a bit, to be a little bit heightened.\"\nDid it come as a shock to be cast as a grandmother? It seems like only yesterday she was a young hornbag, neglecting one-year-old Epponnee  Rae.\n\"That's pretty much how it feels to me, I have to say. Kim was 25 and five-quarters for about 15 years. I was old when I started playing Kim. I'm 54, so I could well and truly be a grandmother. I'm not, but I could be.\" (Riley has a teenage daughter, Maggie.)\nJosh Thomas was easy to work with in Please Like Me , says Gina Riley. Photo: ABC TV \nMight viewers see Catherine as a bit of a bitch? \n\"I don't think she's a bitch, I just think she's quite sharp,\" Riley says.\n\"I think it's tough love, in a way. One daughter's getting herself into an overdramatic state, as young girls are wont to do. As a parent you have to be quite tough and strong. It's not what naturally comes to you – you have to put your child away a little bit, to get them to separate from you.\n\"They've got to know that you're there for them but you've got to not mollycoddle them too much so they don't feel like they can do anything.\n\"Anyone who's got a teenage daughter will absolutely understand Catherine. I don't think she's a mean character at all. I think she's pretty smart and sensible.\"\nBut Catherine does seem to be in Prue and Trude territory … \"It's funny you should say that. The director, Glendyn Ivin,​ laughed when I did something in the audition and then said, 'Sorry, sorry'. I said, 'Don't apologise, where I come from, that's the greatest compliment in the world.'\n\"And then when we met on set, before we started filming, I said 'Glendyn, she's very Pru and Trude, and you've got to tell me if I'm getting too Pru and Trude'. And a couple of times, he did have to whisper in my ear, 'A bit too Pru and Trude'.\"\nThe spectre of the snobby suburbanites came up again when Riley was performing in Please Like Me .\n\"I asked if I could wear a wig to play Donna, while with Catherine it's my own hair. They're not completely dissimilar – she's a middle-class private school girl who married well, familiar territory for me – so I wanted to have a different look.\n\"Josh was easy to work with. It's so great to be involved with the next generation of comedy. It's amazing what Josh has achieved at his age.\"\nThe Beautiful Lie starts on Sunday, October 18, 8.30pm on ABC1. Please Like Me  airs on Thursday, October 22,  at 9.30pm on ABC1 (and the Gina Riley episode is next week). \n\nFor more, go to smh.com.au/entertainment/blog/the-tribal-mind .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:00:04.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
