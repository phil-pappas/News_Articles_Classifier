These images appear on product packaging, billboards, television commercials and, increasingly, online. Indeed, it is human nature to look up to individuals who have achieved greatness and to admire those we deem beautiful and talented. However, while taking an interest in the rich and famous may be fun and harmless, unbridled celebrity worship can be a dangerous and slippery slop.One potential risk of worshiping celebrities is the array of mental and physical health problems that this practice can engender. Due to advances in photographic and imaging techniques, as well as plastic surgery, many celebrities appear deceptively flawless in magazines, movies or music videos. Therefore, while it is natural to aspire to be more like those whom we admire, the object of people's \"natural\" admiration may be that of an increasingly unnatural celebrity. Celebrity worshipers, after realizing that they cannot conform to this perfect ideal, may develop low self-esteem, depression or even eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa.In addition to causing physiological health problems, celebrity idolatry can also wreak havoc on worshipers' social and economic health. People who are obsessed with a particular movie star, athlete or musician many spend unreasonable amounts of time surfing the web or perusing magazines, in efforts to obtain the latest anecdotes or photos of him or her. Eventually, celebrity worship may turn into an addition that consumer all of a person's time, energy and financial resources, leaving in a fantasy world of superficial beauty and glamour.To sum up, it is safe and harmless to look up to the rich and famous, especially if we admire them for their skills and achievements, rather than their skin-deep beauty or luxury lifestyles. As we have seen, however, unchecked celebrity worship can pose serious threats to both worshiper and the object of worship.
