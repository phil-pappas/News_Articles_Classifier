Four? \nRuth Wilson, one of the stars of The Affair , has some fascinating family history with regard to infidelity. \n“I have a grandfather who had four wives and he never divorced and they never knew about each other,” Wilson said. “And that was from 1920 to 1960. \n“It was very easy (back then). He had two wives in the same part of London (England). I don't think that could happen now. \n“It's just the Internet, you know? You’re encouraged to keep in contact and be in contact all the time. Before, you could go away and not be seen for a number of years. So it is much harder now, probably.” \nIndeed, it surely is harder now to keep anything secret. In the second season of The Affair – which debuts Sunday, Oct. 4, on The Movie Network and Movie Central in Canada, and on channel-of-origin Showtime in the United States – the actual “affair” element of the plot became known to all the key characters long ago. \nIn Season 1, two troubled people who were vulnerable for wildly different reasons had a passionate, life-altering fling: Alison, played by Wilson, and Noah, played by Dominic West. Alison is married to Cole, played by Joshua Jackson, and Noah is married to Helen, played by Maura Tierney. \nThe structure of Season 1, which also set up a murder mystery, told the story from the perspectives of both Alison and Noah, and sometimes their recollections differed substantially. I really like The Affair, because it's unique and the performances are strong. But I also can say objectively that by the end of the first season, some of those recollections were so divergent that it stretched common sense. \nThe perspectives of Cole and Helen have been added to the mix for Season 2, but Jackson said the end result will be less confusing, not more confusing. \n“Each episode, the two halves, there were direct counterpoints (in Season 1), and it feels like there's less of that in the second season,” Jackson said. “It has expanded the world that the story is being told in, and some of those characters don't ever overlap, so it's impossible to sort of have that 'he said-she said.'” \nBetween the airings of the first and second seasons of The Affair, the real world dealt with the Ashley Madison scandal, in which a website that facilitates infidelity was hacked. Jackson had an intriguing take, particularly as it relates to his TV show. \nPredicting that he was about to get himself into \"a huge amount of deep s--- at home\"– Jackson is married to actress Diane Kruger – he said, “I actually think that the perverse thing about (the Ashley Madison fiasco) is not that people inside of their own relationships are deciding to step out and betray their significant others. The perverse thing for me is that we, as a culture, still want so badly to shame people. \n“It's something that caught me off guard, actually, with the reaction to our show. There was such a desire for public flogging, 'Oh, these cheaters are finally getting what they deserve.' You don’t know these people. You don’t know their lives. You don’t know their wives, their husbands, their children, their stories. You don’t know anything about them. \n“But we as a culture – I put myself in this, too, right? – have put ourselves in a place to go, 'Tsk, tsk, tsk, you are bad, and I'm glad that you are being publicly punished for it.' ” \nAdded Wilson, “It does end up being a bit of a mob mentality, sometimes either way. \n“We hold marriage on such a pedestal and we want it to work so much, that anyone who goes outside of marriage is kind of scary for all of us, perhaps, because deep down, everyone wants to (have an affair). I don’t know, I’m not sure.” \nWell, one thing we all can agree upon is that four wives is a tad extreme. How did your grandfather support them all, Ruth Wilson? \n“He didn't, really,” she said, warily. “It’s a long story.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:22:31.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
