It’s called Last Night — as in party as if it’s your last night on the planet. \nThe video shows him among friends who dance and frolic with him. It’s uplifting, a soulful pop song that also reveals how much Maddhar has been influenced by hip hop. \nHalf of the proceeds raised by Last Night go in support of the B.C. Children’s Hospital. \n— Emuse 2015 is the second festival of aboriginal electronic music, this year, a combination of workshops, a concert, and the release of a CD, Listen To Our Heartbeat. The workshops incorporate storytelling and other Aboriginal cultural matters along with such things as tape looping and turntabling. The events are free and take place at the Native Education College’s Longhouse campus from 10 a.m. The Musqueam concert features Jordan Abel, Coloma Bobb, Nyla Carpentier and others. Workshops, Oct. 8 and 9; concert, Oct. 9. \n— Forgot to mention in the Garage the arrival of the new one from Oddnoxious, Twofur. It’s so titled because it combines two albums into one CD and is as accessible as Odd’s ever been. His many records range from the amateurishness in the early days to the whimsy of his improvised phase a few years ago. There are elements of punk, metal, jamming and progressive rock in what is a rough, demanding form. Odd bought some better recording equipment a little while ago and these sound like the first fruits. He still isn’t an easy listen, but Twofur is the most conventional record Odd has made. \n— White Rock’s Blue Frog Studio has made a good reputation not only for recording but also as a concert venue. The latest in a blues and roots leaning calendar is Jerry Doucette. The veteran blues guitarist is there Oct. 16 and 17. \n— BreakoutWest, the Western Canada music awards, had an award-winning weekend in Calgary last week. The annual gongfest teamed up with the music festival, Rifflandia, expecting 400 delegates (record companies, booking agents) to attend. They got 600, which speaks well of the prestige earned by Breakout and Rifflandia. \n— The Juno Awards are seeking submissions for nominations with a deadline of Nov. 13. The next Junos are in Calgary, March 28 to April 3. For more information on criteria for submitting: www.junosubmissions.ca. \n— Fine Times release an EP, Better::Bad, October 9. \n— Current Swell’s new single is Young and Able. Its latest tour skips Vancouver but the Victoria group plays two nights in its hometown, Nov. 27 and 28. \n— Vic Levak has another project beside producing mister Blake’s Coming Home. It’s the ambient Tranceology, which comes out, October 21. \n— Michael Buble is the only musician, and only West Coaster (the Garage thinks), named to the Canadian Walk of Fame. The fame festivities will be telecast Nov. 7. \n— Dralms has released his first album, Shook, after putting out some EPs previously. Shook is built on a simplicity in which the sparse instrumentation stands out as its turn comes up. It’s as though the sea parts to allow a guitar or horn to come through. Dralms himself is back in the mix, his high-pitched voice sounding haunted or wounded. Shook seems stuck in one gear, though, and becomes predictable. \n— A reunited (again) Enigmas is at WISE Hall, October 10. Coming soon from them is video release. \n— Jon and Roy release a sixth album, Riverside, Oct. 6. \nCD OF THE WEEK \nDestroyer: Poison Season \nIf there is a rhythm to city life, Destroyer has captured it on Poison Season. It’s city life as it has been painted of New York in the ’70s. It has the feel of David Bowie (starting at Hunky Dory and jumping to Fame) as well as Blaxploitation films (notably Superfly and Shaft). The horns wail like they’re supposed to, the congas are urban, the strings have grandeur and the piano is evocative of Aladdin Sane Bowie. Throw in some Lou Reed and there is a potent mix capturing the beat of the city. \nGIGS \nJoyce Island headlines a bunch of West Coast acts (Oct. 9, Rickshaw), We Found A Lovebird (which has a new LP, Oct. 17, Princeton Pub), Circus In Flames (Oct. 17, Lanalou’s) Carnival of Lost Souls (the umbrella name for a collection of West Coast acts appearing in time for Halloween (Oct. 30, Rickshaw), Good for Grapes (airing songs from the forthcoming The Ropes, Imperial Room, Nov. 12), Humans (Nov. 13, Fortune Sound Club), Allison Crowe Band (Nov. 13, St. James Hall), Trooper (gad, New Year’s Eve, Hard Rock Casino) \ntharrison@theprovince.com \nTom Harrison is the author of the eBook Tom Harrison’s History of Vancouver Rock ’n’ Roll .
