(Martin S. Fuentes/Las  ) By Kristen DeSilvareviewjournal.com \nIt’s been four years since “Parks and Recreation’s” treat yo’ self episode — and to celebrate, you should definitely treat yourself. \nIn the episode, Tom, Donna and Ben spend the day treating themselves — to sweets, shopping and a Batman suit . The episode inspired an annual trend that shouldn’t be stopped now that the show is over. \nIf you’re bored of just going out for mimosas or regular shopping, here are some majorly extravagant ways you can celebrate #TreatYoSelfDay in Las Vegas. \nDrive an exotic car \nAt the Exotics Racing at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway you can drive a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche or an Audi for only a couple hundred dollars. If cars are your thing, 20 laps in a $300,000 Ferrari 430 Scuderia will only set you back $1,249. But, you know, treat yo' self. \nGo the fanciest restaurant you can find \nThe Las Vegas Strip is nearly oversaturated with four- and five-star restaurants. Why not drop a few hundred on meals that will most likely leave you hungry afterward? \nVisit a five-star luxury spa at the Mandarin Oriental \nMassages — what better way to treat yo' self? After you spent the morning sipping on mimosas, visiting a spa is just what you’ll need to clear out your system. Take up the Mandarin Oriental on their suite experience, “Qi Balancing Journey,” for only $700 per person, or perhaps an hour-long Thai massage for $260 per person. Okay, that’s a little pricey — how about a pedicure (only $130 for an hour)? \nEat a $1,000 sundae at Serendipity 3 \nOh yeah, such a thing exists — purely so you can treat yo' self. The “Golden Opulence Sundae” includes one scoop of Tahitian vanilla bean and one scoop of Ecuadorian chocolate ice creams, exotic fruits, chocolate truffles (imported, of course), an orchid made of sugar and, obviously, an edible gold leaf. \nDrink a $2,500 cocktail at Caesars Palace \nAt Fizz, a champagne bar inside Caesar Palace, order the FIZZ Deluxe — a twist on the French ‘75 made with “Grand Marnier Quintessence, Hennessy Richard Cognac, Monin Rose syrup, egg whites for texture, and a finishing touch of Dom Perignon Rosé champagne.” \nGet a tailored suit for as much as your mortgage \nAt Stitched in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, they’re all about fabulously dressed men. What better way to dress well than dropping $2,000 on a new suit? Or have one tailored for (most likely) thousands more? \nIf you want to be realistic about it, you could always treat yourself to a nice dinner, movie or a trip to REI. Either way, do something for you today —for Tom Havorford and Donna Meagle. \nContact Kristen DeSilva at kdesilva@reviewjournal.com .
