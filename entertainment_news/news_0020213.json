F. Vandewater of 2363 Bryant St., who was born in San Francisco in 1871 and who was dreaming of steam locomotives at an age when most boys are happy with tricycles. When he was 15, he went to work as a machinist’s apprentice at the Southern Pacific shops ... at 15th and Harrison. That was before the days of the Bayshore tunnels and cut off, and the SP trains left the city via the Mission district and the Valencia and 25th Street station. Vandewater ... for many years prior to his retirement in 1937 was foreman of the SP roundhouse at Potrero Avenue and Minnesota Street. All his life, the study of the city’s steam lines has been one of his hobbies.\n‘A loco and a car’ \nThe first steam road was, as he put it, “a loco and a car” running out Market Street to Valencia and then out Valencia to 19th and The Willows Amusement Park. This began operation in 1860. Not long afterward, another steam line was built that ran from Market and 8th out Hayes Street. Hayes Valley then was primarily a truck gardening district, and the steam trains helped to develop it into a residential area ... \nVandewater recalls that when the Market Street cable road was built about 1883, there was a steam dummy line that made connections with the Valencia Street horse cars at Market and Valencia, and ran from that intersection out to Market to Castro and 17th. \nThere were several steam lines to the beach. In the eighties, for example, you could take a Market Street Railway cable out Haight Street to the Stanyan Street turntable, then cross Stanyan Street to the shed on the grounds of Golden Gate Park and there board a steam train which cut across the corner of the park to Lincoln Way (then H Street) at about First Avenue. From there the train clattered west on Lincoln Way to the beach, where it turned north and went to the end of the line at about what is now Balboa and LaPlaya. Later, the right of way was shifted out of the park, so that the track extended along Lincoln Way all the way from Stanyan Street to the beach. The one-way fare on this line, as on most of them, was five cents.\n“On Sunday,” Vandewater said, “these locos to the beach pulled five or six open cars which had cross seats and were open on the sides. They had a long outside step along their length for the conductor to walk on.”\nCalifornia and Presidio \nAnother steam line to the beach started at California Street and Presidio Avenue ... and went out California Street to 33rd Avenue, where it turned north and traveled out to what is now Seacliff. There, at the cliffs, it turned again and followed the shoreline around Land’s End and Point Lobos to a train shed at 48th and Point Lobos avenues, across the street from the gates to Sutro’s Gardens. In its day, this was regarded as one of the most scenic and thrilling rides in all the West.\n“But, one Christmas morning,” Vandewater said, “there was a heavy rain, like a cloudburst and it washed the tracks and a hillside near the Land’s End station docissawn into the sea. The line was never rebuilt. Too expensive.”\nStill another steam line to the beach was operated out California Street by the Powell Street Railway .\nVandewater could remember several shorter steam lines. One was a branch of the Powell Railway line to the beach, and extended from California Street and Seventh Avenue down Seventh Avenue to Fulton Street and Golden Gate Park. Another ran on Baker Street, making connections between the Union Street cable line and Harbor View, the cracked crab and steam beer resort located roughly where the Yacht Harbor is today. A third was the Geary Street Park and Ocean railroad’s steam dummy line from Geary and Presidio Avenue ... out Geary to Fourth Avenue and the entrance to the old Bay District racetrack. Although Vandewater remembers riding on this line, he is not clear on whether it extended all the way out to the beach; but he does not think it did.\nToward the end of the century, the cheaper and more dependable operation made possible by electrification spelled the doom of the steam lines. Ultimately, they tooted their last whistle and vanished from the city streets, to be remembered only in faded photographs and the memories of old-timers like Vandewater.\nThis column originally appeared in The San Francisco Chronicle on March 24, 1948.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:16:18.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
