The Legacy Bars of San Francisco, J.K. Dineen gives thirsty readers the lowdown on 26 of the city’s finest saloons, taverns and cocktail bars that he and his collaborator, San Francisco Heritage (whose noble mission includes preserving the city’s cultural environment of neighborhood bars and restaurants), have investigated with vigor. Dineen’s book, which features a series of excellent color photos, stresses friendly neighborhood places full of blue-collar workers, cops, firefighters, nurses, artists and other regular folks. The title of Duggan McDonnell’s “Drinking the Devil’s Acre: A Love Letter From San Francisco and Her Cocktails” comes from an early designation of a section of the Barbary Coast known for its bars and depravity. McDonnell’s book is an impassioned and hyperbolic account (with recipes) of what San Franciscans drank in her earliest days, and what they drink today in craft cocktail lounges. Throughout McDonnell’s book, illustrated with vintage black-and-white photographs, he glamorizes the “mixologists, bar chefs and cocktailians” who are responsible for the current craze for craft cocktails — reconstructed, reimagined drinks flavored with elixirs, tinctures, aromatics, syrups and gum arabic (a powder made from acacia blossoms). Dineen comes by his bar knowledge with two outstanding credentials — he’s a newspaper reporter (for The Chronicle) and an Irish American who enjoyed his first tipple as a kid well under drinking age in County Kerry, in western Ireland, when his father took him to a pub. McDonnell, on the other hand, is a barkeep, distiller, drink historian and zealot for those cocktail establishments that feature what are now known as “bar programs” — places that fashion their own outsize ice cubes with a special saw and decorate their creations with a sprig of kale, perhaps. Dineen’s book has a chapter on the Vesuvio Cafe, once the North Beach haven for the Beats and now patronized by Beat wannabes who, according to Dineen, come in asking, “What did Jack Kerouac drink?” Answer: “Whatever people would buy for him.” Other chapters in Dineen’s book this reviewer developed a thirst for profiled the Pied Piper Bar in the Palace Hotel, established in 1909, with its magnificent, behind-the-bar Maxfield Parrish mural; the Double Play (also established 1909) in the Mission District near the old Seal’s Stadium; Sam Jordan’s Bar & Grill, established in 1959 in Bayview-Hunters Point; and the Philosophers Club, established 1960 in West Portal, which is complete with a ceiling mural of every philosopher you’ve ever heard of. [...] if that doesn’t shake you up, McDonnell invites you to try his Laughing Buddha — fresh ginger, serrano chiles, vodka, lime juice, ginger beer and a whack of that Chinese Five-Spice Agave Nectar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:50:22.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
