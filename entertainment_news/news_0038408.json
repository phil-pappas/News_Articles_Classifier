At the ripe old age of 23? Well, maybe. After all, she has gone from Disney princess to Bieber girlfriend to Taylor Swift Squaddie over the past few years — which doesn’t exactly seem like an upward trajectory. Likewise, her last few albums have been a case of diminishing returns. But before you give up on her, give her one more chance: Her fifth album Revival is easily her strongest work yet. OK, maybe that’s not saying much. And sure, Gomez is surrounded by the usual horde of Scandinavian pop hitmakers here. But remarkably, most of these cuts forsake the usual clubhopping whumpa-whump and flashy EDM synths for pitter-pattering grooves and more subdued keyboard tones that suit her torchy, husky vocals. You didn’t know better, you’d think she’s been listening to the likes of Lorde, Halsey and FKA Twigs. That’s enough of an artistic revival to make this worth checking out. RATING: 3 (out of 5) \nNatural Born Losers It’s always the quiet ones. With her floating-angel vocals and lightly strummed guitar, Ontario singer-songwriter Dollanganger — the first artist on Grimes’ Eerie Organization label — seems like another indie-pop balladeer. Until you listen to her lyrics. Deviant and disturbing enough to make Lana Del Rey seem like The Archies, these unflinching fantasies (one hopes, anyway) of sexual torture, execution and religious downfall seem drawn from a mix of gothic Americana balladry and backwoods torture-porn screenplays. And as her musical backdrops build from unadorned guitars to spooky soundscapes of ominous synths, grinding distortion and sluggishly booming drums, you realize just how deep and dark still waters can run. RATING: 4 (out of 5) \nKilling Joke Pylon Still crazy-angry after all these years. Nearly four decades after their formation — and three discs into their reunion — doom gods Killing Joke haven’t lost their edge on their 16th studio release. Which is to say: Frontman Jaz Coleman still bellows conspiracy theories and dire prophecies of oppressive technocracy, hive minds and the war on freedom. His bandmates, as always, bolster him with guitar-grind riffs and hard-chugging anthems of dissent that obliterate the line between post-punk, metal and industrial. Basically: All remains right with their world — chiefly because all remains wrong with ours. RATING: 3.5 (out of 5) BOX SET Garbage: 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition You wouldn’t expect a band named Garbage to know so much about recycling. But make no mistake: Nothing goes to waste on this four-disc anniversary edition of the self-titled 1995 debut from Shirley Manson, Butch Vig and co. Which means that in addition to the reissue of their original release — which introduced moody synth-rock singles like Queer, Stupid Girl and Only Happy When it Rains — you get nine bonus cuts and B-sides like Subhuman and Girl Don’t Come, along with covers of The Jam’s Butterfly Collector and Vic Chesnutt’s Kick My Ass. So far, so good. Trouble is, you also get three more discs containing more than 40 mostly throwaway remixes from the likes of Massive Attack, Todd Terry and Danny Saber. All of whom cut and paste the tracks into everything from drum ’n’ bass grooves to string-swollen ballads and John Carpenteresque slasher-flick soundtracks. That’s cool and all — but does anybody really want to hear 13 different versions of Milk and 10 of Queer? Stick to the two-disc version. RATING: 3.5 (out of 5) \nNOW HEAR THIS R. City What Dreams are Made Of The R stands for Rock. But it should stand for Reggae, R&B and Rap. That’s mostly what you get from Caribbean brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas. Moving to the mic after penning and producing hits for everyone from Justin and Rihanna to Nicki and Miley, they distinguish themselves by melding bottom-heavy island grooves with urban sonics, anthemic choruses and seamless vocal interplay. Could have done without the 10-minute spoken-word autobiography, though. RATING: 3 (out of 5) Alex G. Beach Music Another week, another bedroom troubadude. Meet Philadelphian Alex Giannascoli, who parlayed Bandcamp cult fame into a major-indie release for this seventh home-made album. Like his peers, he’s eccentric and eclectic as all get out, mumbling and mewling over an ADD mish-mash of Pavement, Elliot Smith, Beach Boys, Ween and whatever else strikes his passing fancy — except for beach music, of course. RATING: 3 (out of 5) St Germain St Germain When you wait 15 years for a holiday, you want to make it special. So, on the long-awaited follow-up to his 2000 electro-jazz smash Tourist, French producer Ludovic (St Germain) Navarre pulls up stakes, journeys to Mali and forsakes his old sound for percussive low-impact trance-grooves, snaky desert-blues guitars and keening vocals. Enjoy the trip. RATING: 4 (out of 5) Chris Walla Tape Loops When some guys go solo, they go all the way. A year after ditching Death Cab, multi-tasker and producer Walla ditches rock for his second outing. True to its title, this consists of atmospheric keyboard-based instrumentals put together from loops on analog tapes. All of which makes for a soothing and relaxing outing — though not necessarily a very interesting one. RATING: 2.5 (out of 5) The Winery Dogs Hot Streak Some dogs have more than one day. And deserve it. Like this supergroup with singer-guitarist Richie Kotzen, bassist Billy Sheehan and drummer Mike Portnoy. Two years after their debut, they’re back with another batch of bluesy classic-rock a la Burn-era Deep Purple, Hagar-years Van Halen and latter-day Soundgarden. They’re barking up the right trees. RATING: 3.5 (out of 5) Clutch Psychic Warfare This is your brain on drugs. Drugs and boogie. If you’re a fan of Maryland vets Clutch, you knew that. Their 11th disc, like all that came before, is a slab of muscle-car stoner-rock that fuses massive riffage, beats that kick like a three-legged mule and twisted tales of X-ray vision, battling giants and decapitation. A mind isn’t always a terrible thing to waste. RATING: 4 (out of 5) Collective Soul See What You Started by Continuing It’s easy to forget about Collective Soul. After all, it’s been six years since their last disc. Longer since their last hit. But with their ninth album, Ed Roland and co. let you know they haven’t forgotten how to craft tight modern pop-rock cuts with razor-sharp hooks and melodies. All of which make See What You Started by Continuing a memorable outing. RATING: 3 (out of 5) The Agent Intellect Head and heart. Brawn and brain. Tension and release. Detroit indie-rockers Protomartyr continue to balance them on their third and most compelling long-player. Give credit to deep-throat frontman Joe Casey’s deadpan rants and dark passion, but don’t discount the band’s restrained amalgam of serrated noise and post-punk. Think The Fall meets Joy Division. Then again, don’t think; just buy it. RATING: 4 (out of 5) \nShawn Colvin Uncovered Sunny came home with some dudes. Again. A decade after her Grammy-nominated Cover Girl, folk-popster Colvin creates another playlist, quietly reinterpreting tunesmiths like Springsteen, Waits, Fogerty, Wonder, Finn and more. What unites them: Her gently strummed guitar, melancholy vocals and haunting pedal-steel accompaniment. Simply lovely. RATING: 3 (out of 5) George Strait Cold Beer Conversation You’re never too old to try new things. So, for his 29th studio affair, Nashville king Strait teams up with a new producer and updates his classic country ever so slightly with contemporary sonics. But fear not: The 63-year-old cowboy crooner’s smooth baritone and everyman songs about blue-collar life and love remain as pure as ever. Here’s to him. RATING: 3.5 (out of 5) Emily Kinney This is War War? It’s not even a good zombie fight. Instead, it’s the second album from Walking Dead alum Kinney, who apparently fancies herself a bit of a folk-pop singer-songwriter. And while she can carry a tune — albeit in the same breathy, girlish tones as her speaking voice — her lightweight, diary-style songwriting doesn’t have nearly enough bite. RATING: 2 (out of 5) Toby Keith 35 mph Town Don’t let that title fool ya: Keith isn’t taking his foot off the throttle. Nor his lips off the bottle. As usual, the country-rocker’s 18th set in 22 years is brimming with rhythm and booze — including salutes to drunk Americans, rum-loving pirates and beer goggles. But Keith makes sure to chase them with ballads for the ladies in case you feel like parking. RATING: 3.5 (out of 5) The Zombies Still Got that Hunger And that humour. But not that sound. Those who recall the pop and psychedelia of ’60s fare like She’s Not There and Time of the Season may be surprised to find Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent’s reanimated Zombies seem more like Donald Fagen and Walter Becker’s Steely Dan, thanks to their supple jazz-rock and well-crafted electric-piano blues. Still, pretty tasty. RATING: 3 (out of 5) Johnny Marr Adrenalin Baby: Live Making studio albums is one thing. Pulling it off live is another. But former Smiths guitarist Marr acquits himself remarkably well here. His fretboard skills may be a given, but his raspy vocals are more than serviceable as he presents a rough ’n’ tumble set of original fare sprinkled with Smiths classics and a Clash-inspired version of I Fought the Law. This wins. RATING: 3 (out of 5) Tom Jones Long Lost Suitcase It’s not unusual — if you’ve been paying attention. Big-lunged Welshman Jones continues the bluesy late-career roll he’s been on since 2010, filling his 41st studio release with another swampy set of juke-joint blues workouts and backporch-folk covers by everyone from Willie, Hank and Sonny Boy to Gillian Welch, the Stones and Los Lobos. Find it. RATING: 4 (out of 5) The Decemberists Florasongs One man’s leftovers are another’s dinner. With this five-track EP, Portland’s Decemberists reheat tracks that didn’t make the cut for 2014’s What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World. And like everything they create, these are folk-pop and indie-rock gems, from the Celtic country of Riverswim to the garage-rock punch of Fits and Starts. Satisfying. RATING: 3.5 (out of 5) DVDs Taste What’s Going On: Live at the Isle of Wight Sometimes good video is like good food: It takes time. Case in point: It took documentarian Murray Lerner 45 years to release this complete performance by Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher’s power trio Taste at the 1970 Isle of Wight music festival. But after finally getting to see them blaze through this legendary 55-minute set — mere minutes after breaking up backstage, no less — all is forgiven. Especially since bonus fare includes live TV performances and surreal videos. Dig in. RATING: 4 (out of 5) Jeff Lynne’s ELO Live in Hyde Park Talk about a return trip. Nearly 15 years after ELO’s previous gig, singer-guitarist Jeff Lynne and keyboardist Richard Tandy fired up the mothership for this 2014 festival show in London’s Hyde Park. And they soar quite impressively, delivering spot-on versions of more than a dozen ’70s orch-rock classics from their vast catalogue. Strange magic indeed. Even better: The disc includes Martyn Atkins’ Mr. Blue Sky, a feature-length documentary on the enigmatic Lynne. RATING: 4 (out of 5) Nazareth No Means of Escape Close enough for rock ’n’ roll. Literally. For this live DVD, the beloved Scottish rockers’ 2014 lineup (including short-tenured singer Linton Osborne) capably crank out an hour-long set of ’70s bar-band classics (and some newer fare) for a clutch of superfans in London’s Metropolis Studio. The bigger treat, however, might be the 50-minute bonus doc that includes plenty of face time with retired longtime frontman Dan McCafferty.
