As one of this year's RangiTaranga approaches 100 days, there is a deja vu moment. Rangitaranga's lead actor Nirup Bhandari was not the original choice for the role. Rakshit Shetty was the first option. But when he did not have dates for the film, the team began looking out for another actor. Nirup was till then the assistant director of the film and in charge of casting. He was calling up actors for auditions of other roles. His brother Anup Bhandari who was the director and producer HK Prakash then decided to cast a newcomer. An internal survey and audition later, the assistant director of the film became its lead actor.\nSpeaking to Mirror, Nirup said, \"I wanted to be an actor and had made preparations for it. But for RangiTaranga I was involved in the scripting with Anup and was doing auditions. Me being cast in the lead role came much later. If Rakshit was not busy in other projects, he would have been in the film not me.\"\nRangiTaranga is only the second Kannada film released this year that will reach the 100 days continious run at the box office in a few days. Nirup said they had hopes about the film. \"We were confi dent about the quality of the film. We expected the word-of-mouth publicity to work and it did. The help audience provided on social media promoting the film was immense.No amount of money would do that. The success of the film is largely to the audience who watched and promoted the film on their own. No one, not even anyone in the film team expected the film to be such a big box office hit.\"\nNirup and the film team are now busy preparing for the 100 days function of the film. \"It will not be on the 100th day but a little later. But all of us are working on that,\" he said. The brothers are also teaming up for their next film together.\"We had decided even before the success of RangiTaranga that our next film would be together. We had a few ideas and we hope people want to see our combination continue. The film will happen sometime in 2016 but it is way too early to predict when it will be released.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:23:56.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
