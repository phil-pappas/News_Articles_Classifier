Photo: Supplied \n\nJULIE FLEMING POP-UP\nIf you haven't found the perfect hat for your Spring Racing ensemble, milliner Julie Fleming's pop-up comes at exactly the right moment. After relocating to South Australia earlier this year, Fleming has returned for a two-week stint to outfit racegoers in style. With many orders already well under way, Fleming also has hundreds of hats ready to go.\nThe traditionally trained milliner set up shop in Melbourne in 1989, and for more than two decades created beautiful hand-made hats for the racing season as well as weddings and other \"big hat\" occasions.\n\"Many of my customers are still wearing hats I made 20 years ago,\" says Fleming.\nAdvertisement This year's collection includes a lot of black, as you might expect in black-obsessed Melbourne, but Fleming says she refuses to stick to one colour and has created feather sculpture hats in \"every colour of the rainbow\".\nAlthough Fleming will be taking appointments, she says walk-in customers are very welcome, and one of the windows in Kazari will be decked out in the latest styles to entice in window shoppers. Ready-made hats range in price from $195-$700.\nJulie Fleming Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival Pop Up is at Kazari, 450 Malvern Road, Prahran, 0413 886 720.
