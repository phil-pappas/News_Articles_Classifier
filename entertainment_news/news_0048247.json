Photo: Simone Pieta Cottrell \nOne of the big draws of the Growing Friends plant sale at the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney next weekend is the cabbage on a stick plant, Brighamia insignis . The lure isn't its good looks. The one-to-two-metre-tall succulent stem is topped by a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves (hence cabbage on a stick). Clusters of tubular, yellow flowers bloom in winter and smell like honeysuckle.\nOdd, rather than gorgeous, the real draw is this plant's endangered status. Its only pollinator is a now extinct moth, so the handful of individuals left on its native Hawaiian islands are hand pollinated by botanists abseiling down the cliff faces. Introducing Brighamia into gardens is the back-up plan to stave off extinction, and plant collectors are keen to help out. All proceeds from sales of the plant go to assist groundwork and conservation at the National Tropical Botanical Garden on Kauai.\nA rare find isn't unusual at the Growing Friends nursery. It's the go-to spot for gardeners hunting out the horticultural hard-to-find: usually open Monday to Saturday, 11am-2pm, it's a dependable adjunct to the biannual plant fairs, Collectors Plant Fair in April, and Plant Lovers Fair at Kariong in September.\nBrighamia insignis, from the Limahuli Garden and Preserve, Kauai, Hawaii.

The money raised goes towards travel scholarships for Gardens botanists, research support and infrastructure.\nAdvertisement It is manned by volunteers who propagate plants from those grown in the public areas of the RBG. The plant list fills gaps in what is commercially available.\n\"There are plants that have gone out of fashion but work well in Sydney, or tube stock sizes of plants you can only buy commercially in large and expensive sizes, as well as the rare and unusual and endangered stuff,\" says Greg Lamont.\nLamont recently started working with Growing Friends as horticultural consultant. He comes from a background in plant research (he was first to launch garden-friendly varieties of Geraldton wax back in the '80s) and commercial plant and cut flower production. His experience and expertise is improving propagation and growth rates in the Growing Friends stock.\nBestsellers at Growing Friends include the myriad members of the begonia family, blue ginger, the silver-rimmed Japanese chrysanthemum, Ajana pacifica,  and rhipsalis, which is hipster chic in hanging baskets, green walls and indoor plants. My personal favourites are the coleus. These foliage fillers for shade can be found in commercial nurseries, but not in the brilliant array of colours and patterns seen on the Growing Friends benches.\nLamont has helped the group work on the coleus collection, improving its uniformity and quality and increasing the range. Hunt for frilled, curled and ruffled leaves in solid burgundy and lime green, as well as complex variations of two or more colours in patterns mad enough to make a tropical fish look underdressed.\nJoining them on the desirables list for the spring plant sale is a rare bronze form of Alcanterea imperialis . This grand bromeliad was popularised by the modernist Brazilian landscaper Roberto Burle Marx, and this form comes from his own garden. Like the Brighamia , this gem will have the enthusiasts arriving early.\nGrowing Friends Spring Plant Sale, October 10-11 and October 17-18, 10am-4pm, Royal Botanic Gardens, Mrs Macquaries Road, city, 9231 8182. Growing Friends will also be at the Berry Gardens Festival, October 8-10.\nIT'S TIME TO ... \nFEED GARDENIAS \nGardenias do well with an all-purpose fertiliser in spring, as well as a fortnightly liquid feed to keep foliage green and glossy and blooms plentiful.\nFIND BROMS \nTake a box to the Bromeliad Fair to stock up on rare and unusual broms, tillandsias and neoregelias. October 10, 10am-4pm; October 11, 9am-noon, Concord Senior Citizens Centre, 9-11 Wellbank Street, Concord.\nPLANT RHUBARB \nNew crowns can go in now. Water to get them established, then only in very dry weather.\nREAD ABOUT WENDY \nWendy Whiteley has spent more than 20 years creating a much-loved public garden at the bottom of her Lavender Bay house.
