It took her nine straight hours to make the diamante and feather-adorned hat, folding and rolling the rabbit fur felt until, finally, her intuition kicked in.\n\"I changed it and changed it until the fabric says, 'OK, I'm ready,\" she said.\nIt's an idea she returns to in conversation, of letting the material guide her, never entirely sure of what the final outcome will be. And it's been a hallmark of her life and career so far, what she calls \"embracing the unpredictable\", an approach which has helped lead her from political imprisonment in her native Iran to fine art studies in Australia and, most recently, to millinery.\nPublic relations doyenne and hat \"fanatic\" Alison Waters encouraged Fatemeh Vafaeinejad to take up millinery. Photo: Paul Jeffers \n\"I just loved it,\" she said of her first attempts at hat-making. \"I thought uh-oh, I've found another way to make a sculpture.\"\nAdvertisement Vafaeinejad, who has only been making hats for six months, sees her creations as part of a kind of performance art, the women who wear them participants in her creative process. A trained painter and sculptor, she studied a masters in fine art at the Victorian College of the Arts and was a finalist in the 2008 Blake Prize for religious art with her work Open to the Hidden , a blank canvas torn to expose the crucifix-like shape of the frame beneath.\nSince 2013 she has been focused on establishing and running her gallery and studio, Moonee Art Space , into which she's funnelled most of her creative energies while painting and sculpture took a back seat. Then public relations doyenne and hat \"fanatic\" Alison Waters came along and encouraged her to take up millinery and now her first range, eight hats in sweeping shapes like birds about to take flight, are for sale at avant garde Collins Street boutique Cose Ipanema.\nBird shapes are a strong motif through Vafaeinejad's work. Photo: Supplied \n\"I think I named her the Zaha Hadid of millinery, they're quite extraordinary,\" Cose Ipanema's manager and buyer Sam Hussein said.\nAll of this seems a long way from Vafaeinejad's roots in Damghan, Iran, where she spent much of her childhood. And it seems even further from the three years and eight months she was imprisoned there, jailed for her peace activism as a 19-year-old. But it's precisely this period which the 49-year-old credits for her artistic awakening. The prison bed was her first studio, she says, her fellow inmates her first portrait subjects.\n\"The secret to my survival is that I don't get the danger,\" she laughs. \"When God created me – or whoever – they didn't put that hormone of fear in me.\"\nBut when, as an art student in Tehran after her release, Vafaeinejad says it became clear that her political past would dog her and prevent her from further study she knew it was time to leave her beloved country. She sought asylum through the United Nations refugee agency and spent three years in Pakistan, drawing, painting and exhibiting, waiting to hear which country would grant her sanctuary. In 1999, she landed in Melbourne.\n\"I didn't have any idea that I would come to Australia ... but I'm happy. I'm happy that I experienced difference, that I experienced a different culture.\n\"When I came to Australia I knew I must go to uni right now.\"\nIt took her a year but when she eventually did start at VCA, Vafaeinejad straddled both painting and sculpture, to the bemusement of staff. She pursued sculpture while housed in the painting department, painting while working from the sculpture school. \"They secretly liked me,\" she winks. Here, she also created the plump ceramic birds that were to become a motif in her work, a hark back to the French cartoon Wattoo Wattoo​ about a superhero bird she loved as a kid.\n\"It goes back to what I really care about: peace, freedom and harmony.\"\nThe birds can also be seen in the swollen bellies of figures from her later drawings, towering shapes referencing the Australian trees that first inspired her in her new home. Birds also adorn the jewellery she's created and it's no surprise that her hats echo them too.\nNine years after her arrival in Australia, Vafaeinejad felt ready to make her first trip back to Iran – her friends here cautioning against returning to danger. But in her mind, it was possible for people and society to change, for the country of her youth to have evolved. She has made multiple returns since then (not without questioning at the airport), each time feeling invigorated by the youth on the streets, by its art and design scene and a culture which \"cannot be colonised\".\n\"I was listening to my friends who were Iranian who left many years ago and who never came back,\" she says. \"I was watching them and the way they were talking - they don't see the possibility that a country and people can change. And then I thought to myself, oh my God, I don't want to become a prisoner in my head and be frightened all the time.\"\n\"Being in chaos is one thing, but carrying it for your entire life is another thing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:20:43.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
