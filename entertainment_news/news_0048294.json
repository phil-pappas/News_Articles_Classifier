Photo: Jade Cantwell \n\nSarah Blasko has it figured out; she could write this story herself. \"I can hear the sort of piece that people want this to be,\" she says, takeaway coffee in hand and a determined look on her face. \"Sarah's settled down and she's really happy and this is a really happy record.\n\"Dave Miller is her partner and they live in the suburbs of Sydney, in Newtown, where all the young families are. This is an album about somebody settling down.\"\nAll wrong.\nAfter years of writing about loneliness, ambiguity and complexity, Sarah Blasko has made an album about falling in love. Photo: Jade Cantwell \nNot that the biographical facts are incorrect, but Blasko's fifth album,  Eternal Return , is about something else entirely. \"Actually this album is about that early feeling of being in love with somebody and about that connection,\" she says.\nAdvertisement Being in love is no small matter, personally obviously, but for Blasko, also professionally. Her songs have often mined a darker seam of loneliness, isolation, ambiguity and complexity. They show the legacy of a spiritual upbringing in a series of religious communities, including an early version of Hillsong; those beliefs no longer speak to her but their imprint lingers.\nWhen talking about those earlier songs, she would deflect or distract; it wasn't about her, she argued. Or not all about her.\nThere's no deflection today. \"It is quite clearly a love record,\" she says. \"There is no disguising that. There is no veil in the language.\n\"But then, I think to go on too much about my own situation – whether it's in regards to being in love or whatever – always seems a bummer in a way ... Because you are trying to write an album that's universal, that people can relate to, you don't want that stuff to overshadow what you are doing.\"\n\nStill, it's true that Blasko, who just turned 39, now has a son – Jerry, a few months old – and a partner who is a musician and \"computer nerd\". In the past year they have moved into what might pass for an artist colony or enclave in inner-city Newtown/Camperdown, with many musician and filmmaking friends within five or 10 minutes' stroll. We meet one of these near the cafe on the path to a nearby park: the Presets' Julian Hamilton out with his small daughter,  a pair who regularly encounter Blasko on her daily walks.\nBlasko sits with a church spire rising above a lavishly graffitied wall behind us, dog walkers in front and a middle-aged man in office attire flying some kind of remote-controlled UFO a few metres away.\nHer favourite bench is taken, which throws her momentarily, even as she mocks herself about it; routine has become important in her life.\nWe have walked from the house on this crisp and suddenly bright morning because Miller was putting their boy down to sleep when I arrived. Blasko joked (probably) that Miller liked to work in the nude when home for the day. In an open-plan house, she said, that might be a bit too much information for one interview.\nBut it makes sense to leave the house behind, because  Eternal Return is not an album about her son. Not one song is about him. \"He's got to earn his stripes,\" she says jovially. Nor is it about motherhood. The songs were written before the pregnancy and recorded before the birth, as Blasko worked concurrently on music for her director friend Brendan Cowell's film  Ruben Guthrie . She spells out the chronology a few times.\nBlasko has written about love before, but this seems like the first time she has sung about love without questions or doubts. \"Yes, that's true,\" she says. \"I think when you first fall in love, there is no doubt going into it. You're going in like a child, going in wholeheartedly. It's great as a songwriter to really be able to capture that wonder period where you are in the throes of those feelings. Some of my favourite records are really in the throes of something significant and ... oh, where was I going with that?\n\"I'm having an existential crisis: where am I going, generally?\" Her train of thought is lost in laughter. Blasko often seems serious in public, her discomfort evident in nervous hand gestures and rapid stabs of words, but she laughs often and easily away from cameras and recorders.\nShe takes comedy seriously, too; it's no coincidence that her son shares his name with Jerry Seinfeld, the star of one of her favourite shows.\nLongtime friend, occasional collaborator and another relatively recent mother, Holly Throsby, calls Blasko \"totally hilarious\" and even silly. \"Her sense of humour is a cross between hammy musicals and Woody Allen films and Seinfeld ,\" Throsby says. \"She is a very funny person – dry and ridiculous and she tells a great story. I have a video of her and [expat Australian musician] Jim White doing Empire State of Mind at a karaoke bar in New York. Sarah was Jay Z. I laughed till I cried.\"\nHaving recovered, Blasko returns to this album. \"That was the aim: to chronicle something that was totally emotionally in the moment,\" she says. \"I have done that before but it's been not in such lovely circumstances. The last record [ I Awake ] was very clearly capturing a period of time where I was living in Brighton – [an] alone-with-yourself kind of album. Very lonely.\n\"As Day Follows Night [which preceded I Awake ], I described at the time as a hopeful heartbreak album because the subject matter was very much a heartbroken state. So I've always done it, but this is the first time I've captured this happiness.\"\nThis is the first time she has said, over and over, I am happy. Plain, blissfully, happy.\n\"That's just like, 'I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love'. It's not even about happiness,\" Blasko says. \"You are wanting to tap into that ecstasy of love and that freshness.\n\"It's a real challenge to try and write a love song and to write a pop song. And they were the challenges I set for myself: I wanted to write a really tight album of great pop songs and, yes, that would be about love because that's what I was going through.\n\"I love Smooth FM for that very fact; love songs that are really solid pop songs. I've been trying to write a pop album the whole time. No one loves a good pop love song more than me.\"\nThis prompts another laugh and another confession. Blasko is a fan of big musicals, mostly on film. \"I've definitely got that sort of camp side. I love a bit of cabaret and musicals.\" Her sentimental favourite is  The Sound of Musi c. \"I grew up watching it every year on TV. Captain von Trapp is like my ideal man: Christopher Plummer, I still find him hot.\n\"My taste in men has changed a little bit over the years,\" she giggles. \"But that's where it started. And he was a softie underneath.\"\nDid she find out eventually that not all men in the Captain's stiff-backed, emotionally-closed image were softies? That some of them were ... \"dickheads? Complete and utter dickheads? Yeah. Definitely been there.\"\nThe deadline for recording Eternal Return  ran close to the deadline for the birth of Blasko and Miller's child. \"It was [a matter of] 'hurry up, he wants to get out',\" she says. \"It felt like a very special, honest and open time.\"\nBlasko worked on the album with producer Burke Reid, a seemingly surprising choice given his background working with men in rock-based bands. \"I just gelled with him as a guy. I felt like he got it easily,\" she says.\nReid \"didn't really give a shit\" that Blasko was pregnant when there was work to be done. They lived at the out-of-Sydney studio, spending their recording, cooking and downtime together.\nBut her pregnancy had an impact as they recorded into the early hours. \"I was really out of breath,\" she says. \"I left singing until last, which at the time I thought was the most stupid idea because, literally, between takes I had my arms up against up against a wall.\" She pants heavily, gasping for breath, to demonstrate.\n\"It's probably the longest I've spent trying to get vocals down ... It was days and days of singing. You are so in touch with your body and what your body needs when you are pregnant. I'd be like, 'I'm sorry, I've got to go have a snack and a drink before we continue.'\"\nReid accommodated her stylistic choices, stripping away almost all guitars and making a synthesiser-based album, reproducing sounds from the 1980s. Blasko doesn't \"really like technology all that much\" but wanted something both electronic and \"organic\". These are the sounds she grew up with.\n\"There's a definite nostalgia on the record. I think a lot of my albums are nostalgic for something. I guess when I think of a classic love song, I think of the '70s and the '80s,\" she says. \"It makes sense in a way because I think falling in love, like I said before, it's like a return to something of who you are as a child. It makes sense to have a bit of those nostalgic elements when relating to love.\n\"You feel in life, at various times, like something [is] so familiar to you that it's like a recurrence of something that has happened here before ... There's something really beautiful about that because it's like, oh, wait a minute, this is so familiar, this feels so honest.\n\"All of those feelings connect to childhood because that's when you are at your most honest, when you are not hiding anything. It's where a lot of your important memories are from and how you become who you are ... Falling in love is letting go and being wholehearted in what you are doing and that's a very childlike state.\n\"I think it's kind of cool that there is that connection between the love song, childhood and some of these sounds.\"\nEternal Return is out on November 6.
