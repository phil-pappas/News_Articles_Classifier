Fox 'Back to the Future' sneakers Shoe company selling more Nike MAGs to support Parkinson's research UPDATED 12:42 PM PDT Oct 21, 2015 Photos From NBCU via CNN \nNike sent a pair of self-lacing sneakers to Michael J. Fox Wednesday to mark the day that Marty McFly and Doc Brown arrived in the future -- October 21, 2015 -- in \"Back to the Future Part II.\" 'Back to the Future' stars then and now \nWednesday marks the unofficial celebration of \"Back to the Future\" Day, the Oct. 21, 2015, date that Marty McFly travels to in 1989's \"Back to the Future Part II.\" To mark the occasion, check up on the stars of the blockbuster film series. \n\"Back to the Future\" Day is Wednesday, and fans are tallying up the 1989 film's predictions of life in the year 2015. \nHow did the movie do? Here are some of its hits and misses: \nBig-screen televisions and video conferencing: Yes \nThe film features severa... Welcome, 'Back to the Future' Day \n\"Back to the Future\" Day has finally arrived. \nIn \"Back to the Future Part II,\" Marty McFly travels to October 21, 2015, to save his children, yet to be born in \"Back to the Future's\" 1985. \nThe plot gets tangled -- by fixing one thing, McFly and Doc Br... More \nThe shoe company said it was making additional pairs to be sold in support of the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The foundation does research into Parkinson's disease, which Fox was diagnosed with in 1991. \nSneakerheads and \"Back to the Future\" fans had been hopefully anticipating that Nike would produce the shoe for commercial sale. \nWord of the shoe got out when Fox tweeted today, \"The letter I received from Tinker today. Thanks @Nike.\" \nTinker appears to be Tinker Hatfield, a Nike shoe designer. \nIn his note, \"Tinker\" writes, \"As the first most celebrated wearer of the Nike Air Mag, we wanted you to be first to receive a 'living pair.'\" \nThe note, which includes a drawing of Fox holding the new sneaker, went on to say, \"In addition to your personal pair we're creating more pairs for support in aid of the Michael J. Fox Foundation.\" The note says those shoes will be available in 2016. \nAn auction of \"Back to the Future\" shoes in 2011 raised $9.4 million. \nThe speculation about the shoe went into high gear Tuesday night with a cryptic tweet from the shoe company to Fox that said, \"See you tomorrow.\" \nThe \"tomorrow\" that the company was talking about is Wednesday, October 21, 2015, or the day that Fox's Marty McFly travels to the future in 1989's \"Back to the Future Part II.\" \n\"The first pair of self-lacing Nike Mag shoes is in New York City,\" Nike told CNN. \nThe company wouldn't go into details about the location of the shoes or even if the shoes were going on sale. \nIn the film, McFly tries on a pair of grey Nike high-tops, known as \"Nike MAGs,\" that to McFly's surprise self-lace. \n\"Power laces! Alright!\" McFly says in the film. \nNike's tweet had fans exclaiming \"great Scott!\" on social media over the possibility that the shoes are on the way. \nSince the film's 1989 release, the shoes have become a longed-for item for the movie's fans and sneaker enthusiasts. \nThe company patented an \"automatic lacing system\" in 2008. The letter I received from Tinker today.
