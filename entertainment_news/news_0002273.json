Then you'll like Land Sliders. which offers up a wacky world to explore with the gliding swipe of your finger. The game is high on quirk: You start with a roller-skating explorer, but as you play you can unlock characters that include a clothes dryer, an elephant and a plate of tacos. You can opt to either control your characters directly or move the ground beneath their stationary feet.\nThe goal is to collect as many items as possible while avoiding cliff edges, hungry bears and other obstacles. What you're looking for depends on your chosen character -- the dryer hunts for socks, for example. It's all a little strange. But it's also weirdly addictive. And you can play forever, as long as you stay alive. Free, for iOS devices.\nInkboard Sometimes a photo just isn't enough. Inkboard is an app that gives you an easy way to enhance your photos with notes and drawings, then save them for your own amusement or to share with friends. Users have the option to take a picture or pull a snap from their phone's gallery and then scribble on it with a variety of in-app tools that simulate crayons, highlighters, pencils and permanent markers.\nThe tools are pretty realistic looking -- so much so that you'll find it's better to scribble over light colors than darker ones, lest your drawings blend into the background. You can also use Inkboard to scribble on blank canvasses, if you get the urge to doodle without any limitations. Free, for iOS and Android devices.\n Business Technology Internet Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-10T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:12:04.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
