By Jake Coyle NEW YORK — Opening just days after NASA announced findings showing water on Mars, “The Martian” soaked up moviegoers at the box office.\nRidley Scott’s 3-D space epic touched down in theaters with a robust $55 million over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The results again proved moviegoers’ abiding thirst for space adventures, particularly ones that rely more on mathematics than monsters.\nThe 20th Century Fox release, starring Matt Damon as an astronaut left for dead on Mars, exceeded expectations to nearly rank as the top October debut ever. The estimated North American opening of “The Martian” surpassed that of Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” ($47.5 million) and virtually equaled the debut of Alfonso Cuaron’s “Gravity” ($55.8 million).\nIt’s Scott’s second best opening behind 2001’s “Hannibal” and Damon’s second best after 2007’s “Bourne Ultimatum.”\nMade for $108 million, “The Martian” received a publicity boost earlier in the week when NASA announced it had found evidence of water on the surface of Mars — a cosmically fortuitous tie-in for a movie that celebrates NASA ingenuity. Adapted from the Andy Weir novel, “The Martian” — more “science-fact” than science fiction — relishes pragmatic scientific problem solving and NASA’s spirit of exploration.\n“What separates this movie — it has the backdrop of science — but all of the science is presented in a way that’s very approachable for all,” said Chris Aronson, head of distribution for Fox.\nAronson noted that the shift in release date from Nov. 25 to early October gave the film a more open path at the box office, where it could play well through the month. The film added $45.2 million internationally.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released today:\n1. “The Martian,” $55 million ($45.2 million international).\n2. “Hotel Transylvania 2,” $33 million ($20.4 million international).\n3. “Sicario,” $12.1 million ($3.3 million international).\n4. “The Intern,” $11.6 million ($15.7 million international).\n5. “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,” $7.7 million ($13.7 million international).\n6. “Black Mass,” $5.9 million.\n7. “Everest,” $5.5 million ($16.4 million international).\n8. “The Visit,” $3.9 million ($3.3 million international).\n9. “War Room,” $2.8 million.\n10. “The Perfect Guy,” $2.4 million.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14783142.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14783142.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:04:26.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
