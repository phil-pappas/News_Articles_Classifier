(Philip Toscano/PA) \n“He had my CV in front of him,” he told the Radio Times. “We sat at a table and he didn’t look at me at all. He didn’t ask me any questions, so after a few minutes I said, ‘Would you like me to tell you a bit about myself?’ \n“He just looked of the window and started whistling. Then every so often, this is absolutely true, he would look at my CV and go, ‘huh’. \n“I realised this was probably not going to work out, so I stopped talking. He got up and walked out, and as he went, he just said, ‘Bored’. \n“I had another job lined up, so I didn’t care, but I wondered why I’d even turned up – he obviously had zero interest. Within a few minutes the marketing director came running in and said, ‘Alan likes you, you’ve got the job,’ and that was it.” \nLittner will be stepping into the shoes of Sugar’s old friend and right-hand man, Nick Hewer, and these days he and Sugar are good friends.

Be very afraid. \n— Lord Sugar (@Lord_Sugar) October 2, 2015 \nThe new batch of Apprentice contestants are in for a tough ride, especially if Littner gets angry. \n“My problem,” the former Amstrad and Tottenham chief executive explained, “is that I am a Jekyll and Hyde character. I mean, I am a very nice bloke, aren’t I? \n“But if you put something in front of me that isn’t right, I will get angry. What’s that guy who turns green when he gets upset?” \nThe tough-talking executive made a name for himself interviewing prospective Apprentice winners for Lord Sugar during the show. \nAs the “chief interrogator” during the final interview rounds of the show, he has shown no mercy to candidates, with many leaving one of his famous interviews in tears. \nThese days though, due to a health scare in 1997, he’s infinitely more “chilled”. \nAt 48 he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare blood cancer, which he says was “life-changing”. \n“I was a young man, at the height of my career, and I could have died, I really could.” \nHe went on to say: “Today, my life is completely different, I barely recognise myself. \n“For many years I was absolutely obsessed with being successful, and successful doesn’t necessarily mean money; it meant feeling good about myself, knowing that I had achieved whatever I could.

So from that point of view, I have nothing more to achieve.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:00:22.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
