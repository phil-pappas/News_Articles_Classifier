The alleged unidentified woman, who claimed she was forcibly removed from Brown's tour bus outside a Denver strip, has decided not to press charges. \nThe gossip site reports that authorities interviewed other witnesses but apparently they were unable to find evidence substantiating the woman’s allegations, which Brown initially denied on Twitter . \nMeanwhile, the singer is still facing a ban from Australia over his 2009 assault on Rihanna, which could cause him to cancel his concert tour in December. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
