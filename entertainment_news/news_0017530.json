This is one like you would put a rat in,” said Larry Newsom. “People could wander through the maze for hours if we’d let them … Typically the monsters take pity on them and chase them out — or lead them out.” It might be Newsom. He is in the Hawfields Civitan Club, and along with the Hawfields Junior Civitan Club the Civitans design, build and star in the Haunted Forest at 2115-B N.C. 119 South, behind Hawfields Presbyterian Church. This is the 43rd event. The Haunted Forest is the biggest fundraiser for the nonprofit organizations every year. It’s also Newsom’s favorite. The clubs fund a lot of good causes, especially youth sports programs in Mebane, but also a regular dance for the disabled, Christmas Cheer and meals at the Ronald McDonald House, among others. “We’re involved in a lot of things locally,” Newsom said. “We scare because we care.” There are indoor as well as outdoor scares including a Carrie-themed room, spider tunnel, cannibal room and clown room. “Nobody likes clowns,” Newsom said. On any given night, there could be 50 or 60 volunteers covered in gore and scaring the mess out of visitors. Tickets are $10 — cash or credit card only. Hours are 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 7:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Oct. 29, 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Oct. 30 and 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Oct. 31. A concessions stand is open nightly. There also are “no scare” dates from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 24 and Oct. 31 for kids 12 and younger. Cost is $2. Get complete details at hchauntedforest.com .
