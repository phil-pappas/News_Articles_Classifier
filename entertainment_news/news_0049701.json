I went skinny dipping with him. Also, by the way, with Greta Garbo.\n\"He (Jackson) wanted to be a movie star - he had just finished doing The Wiz - and he had a tape recorder with him, and every day I would bring him to the set, and in between scenes she (Katharine Hepburn) would sit down in a chair and pull over a chair for him and tell him stories.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://twitter.com/Janefonda", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:54:54.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
