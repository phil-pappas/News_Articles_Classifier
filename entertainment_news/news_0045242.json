This is how it’s done, “Scream Queens.” As for Rye, he discovers what goes around sometimes runs you over.\nAnd what do Peggy (Kirsten Dunst. “Spider-Man”) and Ed (Jesse Plemons, “Breaking Bad”) Blumquist have to do with any of this? Why, they’re just the nicest couple. She’s a beautician and he’s a butcher’s assistant and he’s hoping to buy the shop and he wants kids, but on “Fargo” what you want and what you get might as well be the difference between the moon and a moon pie.\n“You’re kind of a bad girl, aren’t you?” Peggy’s boss says admiringly in the Oct. 19 episode. She doesn’t have a clue.\nState trooper Lou Solverson (Patrick Wilson, “The Conjuring”) is stuck investigating the rising body count, and he’s helped by his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson (Ted Danson, now on “CSI: Cyber”), though, to be fair, Lou’s wife Betty (Cristin Milioti, “How I Met Your Mother”) turns out be better than anyone at finding evidence. (You might remember Lou and daughter Molly from the first season, when they were played by Keith Carradine and Allison Tolman. Here, Molly is but a child.)\nEvery performer here brings his or her A-game, and the little nods to the day — such as the chatter about a seminar that will help “actualize” the attendees or the salesman who believes that the electric typewriter represents an unparalleled technological revolution — are both striking and sad. Writer Noah Hawley (who also serves as executive producer along with the Coen brothers) has concocted a wicked brew of characters, crime and a touch of crazy. The show is shot like no other prime-time show and features split-screen work and, befitting “Fargo,” a frozen backdrop that seems as forlorn as most of its characters.\n“Well, this is a deal,” Hank comments while surveying a murder scene. Like everyone here, he’s underplaying it. Not me. “Fargo” is terrific.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:39:04.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
