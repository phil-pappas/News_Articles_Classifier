And the latest run doesn't look likely to disappoint. \nNow an integral part of the team, Maddox is set to investigate more murder mysteries and, as Griffin reveals, \"she's back with confidence\". \n\"When Lizzie first arrived, she was on the verge of leaving because Hathaway was driving her mad, but they've since found a way to rub together. \n\"She knows her place, so they get along well,\" she declares. \nBut her character's new-found poise doesn't end there: channelling a more relaxed hairstyle and leaving her formal suits behind in favour of a more youthful leather jacket, she's more laid-back and \"less severe\". \nWhile her husband is working away in Canada, Maddox even finds herself going out more and drinking with new friends. \n\"They've been together since they were young, so this is her first taste of independence and she's really enjoying it,\" Griffin sympathises. \nAnd what about acting drunk? \"I've got plenty of experience to draw on,\" says the actress, chuckling. \nBut with two daughters with her actor husband Jason Milligan, she struggles to empathise with child-free Maddox, claiming \"it's far easier to come into work with a hangover, than it is to wake up with two children who don't understand your pain\". \nFulfilling a detective role must present some challenging scenes? \"I've not got a gun and I've not had any chases yet, so my biggest challenge to date is actually filming in a leather jacket mid-heatwave,\" Griffin teases. \n\"Oh – and I did have to run in heels,\" she adds. \"I was wearing a block heel on cobbles, and everyone was so worried that they went out and bought me trainers! I run in heels all of the time – I've got children!\" \nAs for learning detective and law enforcement jargon, she promises that it's to be strictly \"left behind in the Winnebago\" after filming, and while the team are keen to keep the drama as realistic as possible, Griffin explains that the series would be \"utterly dull, boring and laborious\", should they stick to every real-life process. \n\"It's television. There are certain things that need an artistic license, but I leave it up to the writers to tell me what the procedure is. We don't do anything that would be glaringly dangerous.\" \nSo if she's not swotting up on the lingo, what does the seasoned actress do between takes? \"I spend a lot of time on my phone,\" she admits, \"which is terrible, as I'm always telling my children not to be on theirs. I email, do some business, play Candy Crush and use Twitter and Instagram. \n\"Oh, and I'm reading a very good book at the moment – The Children Act by Ian McEwan.\" \nWell acquainted with iconic British TV, Griffin credits Lewis for allowing her to \"be a part of something\". \n\"It's the tradition; when you're part of a show that you know is really loved and obviously works, it's a lovely feeling.\" \nFrom the cobbles of Oxford to the famous cobbles of Weatherfield, she is happy to admit that she wouldn't rule out a return to Corrie, but \"it would have to be a really good storyline\". \n\"I left 18 years ago, so if I went back, I would have to take Steve's love child with me [who would now be 18], and my character's child, who would be 20,\" Griffin ponders. \"Now that's a scary thought...\" \n- Catch the new series of Lewis on ITV on Tuesday, October 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:44:48.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
