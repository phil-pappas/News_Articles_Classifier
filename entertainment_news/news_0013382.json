(Photo: Universal Pictures)\n2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Chances are, you've already heard about how good the Steve Jobs biopic is . Now, it's time to actually listen to the film's score.\nSteve Jobs , which opens wide Oct. 23 after this weekend's record-breaking limited release , follows Jobs (Michael Fassbender) as he prepares for three different product launches, which serve as the film's three clearly-drawn acts: Act 1 is the 1984 launch of the Mac, act 2 is the 1988 presentation of the NeXT computer and act 3 is the release of the 1998 colorful iMac.\nComposer Daniel Pemberton premiered the film's score, and chatted about writing music for a dialogue-heavy biopic with USA TODAY:\nAct 1: Change the World\nWhen Pemberton agree to compose the Steve Jobs score, he read the abnormally long script (185 pages as opposed to the regular 120) and thought, \"this script is amazing, but where the hell am I gonna put any music?\" Don't worry: He found plenty of places, and his score that veers from electronic to symphonic helps every onscreen conversation (of which there are numerous) sound epic, and varied.\nIn act one, Pemberton wanted the music to feel like it was from 1984, so he wrote composed it on synthesizers that were re-tuned to sound like keyboards from the '80s. And if you hear something that resembles Chariots of Fire , the inspiring Vangelis theme that was played during the actual '84 Mac launch, that's no accident.\nIf you want to use this song to score your real life: Play it when you have a great idea.\nAct 2: The Circus of Machines\nThis act, which shows Jobs presenting a computer at his new company after being ousted by Apple, is about revenge and betrayal, so \"Why not write an opera?\" says Pemberton.\nPemberton indeed composed an Italian opera that can be translated to be about \"the wonders of machines,\" he says, which was perfectly set in the San Francisco Opera House.\nThe pairing of opera and Jobs made sense to Pemberton, because the score is \"using the oldest computers of all time: the orchestra, this amazing machine,\" he says. \"You give it data, and it interprets in a way that hasn't be replicated by technology today, with emotion and nuance.\"\nIf you want to use this song to score your real life: Play it when you're being dramatic, but playful.\nAct 3: Life Out of Balance\nPemberton says, \"(Screenwriter) Aaron Sorkin's dialogue is the libretto\" of the movie, so it was important that he let the dialogue breathe, while also not creating a \"Social Network part 2 score,\" he says. To achieve both of those goals, Pemberton created distinct moods for each act, concluding with a \"coldness\" in act 3. Of course, the music was written on a MacBook Pro with Apple Logic software.\n\"One of (Jobs's) big ambitions was to allow you to achieve great things-- he calls the computer a bicycle for the mind,\" says Pemberton, who felt very connected to Jobs while composing the biopic music. \"Working inside my Apple, I used just Apple software to interpret (the Jobs ) story.\"\nIf you want to use this song to score your real life: Play it when you're really upset.\n2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1LpuzI6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1LpuzI6", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801663879396613-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-dcb.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0a390367608d96dde7695f23077e449ab1b6d0e/r=500x207/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801663879396613-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-dcb.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27175facdad41602f70b655337419149a54789ea/c=286-0-2274-1495&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801663879396613-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-dcb.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LpuzI6&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LpuzI6&text=First%20listen%3A%20%27Steve%20Jobs%27%20score%20has%20synthesizers%2C%20Italian%20opera&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:55:11.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
