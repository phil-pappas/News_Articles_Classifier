We are in the middle of a golden age for horror on television, although perhaps that's the wrong color to aptly describe this creepy programming boom. How about blood-red?\nLeading the way in terms of both ratings and pop-culture buzz is AMC's \"The Walking Dead,\" which, as you might have heard, begins its sixth season at 9 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 11. Leading the way in terms of Emmy nominations and victories is FX's \"American Horror Story,\" which began its fifth season, subtitled \"Hotel,\" at 10 p.m. Wednesday.\nStill, as much attention as these two genre leaders tend to get, they are just the tip of the tombstone, so to speak. They both make a haunting habit of returning during the Halloween season, which Ray Bradbury termed the October Country, but the eerie reality is that horror has become a year-round business on television. There's no escaping it.\nTwo of the most stylish of the current horror series, Showtime's \"Penny Dreadful\" and WGN America's \"Salem,\" will begin their third seasons in the spring. Writer-producer John Logan, a Tony winner for \"Red\" and an Oscar nominee for \"Gladiator,\" is the creator of the magnificently murky monster-mash-up \"Penny Dreadful.\" Canton McKinley High School graduate Brannon Braga is the co-creator of the dark 17th-century witch's brew known as \"Salem.\"\nAnother FX spooker, producer-director Guillermo del Toro's \"The Strain,\" which wrapped up its second season last Sunday, Oct. 4, will return next summer. Another AMC fright factory, \"Fear the Walking Dead,\" concluded its first season last Sunday (the \"Walking Dead\" spinoff will return with a 15-episode second season next year).\nExecutive producer Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network series, \"From Dusk Till Dawn,\" airs the eighth episode of its second season at 9 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 13. Like \"The Strain,\" this blend of action and horror is for those whose tastes run to vampires with some bite.\nIf AMC isn't throwing enough zombies at you, there's \"Z Nation,\" the zombie apocalypse comedy-drama that's airing at 10 p.m. Fridays on Syfy.\nSo the terror titans of the cable universe are sending zombies, vampires and witches our way. Where are the werewolves? They're there.\nMTV's series version of \"Teen Wolf,\" starring Tyler Posey as the title lycanthrope, resumes its fifth season in January. \"Bitten,\" starring Laura Vandervoort, will return with its third season next year on Syfy.\nMore? Well, A&E's \"Bates Motel\" will reopen for bloody business in 2016. It's expected to begin its fourth season in March.\nThere's even more scary stuff in the cable realm, but that gives you the general idea of what's lurking out there. And there's more on the way, including \"Channel Zero,\" a horror anthology in the works at Syfy.\nSo maybe you're thinking, OK, that's cable. Chart a wide course around that graveyard, and the monsters can't get you. Think again.\nThe networks have their share of high-profile horror, too. Fox has \"Sleepy Hollow,\" which began its third season Oct. 1 on WJW Channel 8. NBC has \"Grimm,\" which begins its fifth season on Friday, Oct. 30, on WKYC Channel 3. And the CW has four monster-minded shows that began new seasons last week on WBNX Channel 55: \"Supernatural,\" \"iZombie,\" \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"The Originals.\"\nFox will begin its much-touted miniseries revival of \"The X-Files\" on Sunday, Jan. 24. And the CW is developing a series based on the Clive Barker novel \"Weaveworld.\"\nStreaming? Are you safe in the Internet streaming world? Not really.\nNetflix will premiere the third and final season of \"Hemlock Grove\" on Friday, Oct. 23, and it has the horror series \"Montauk\" in development.\nThat's not counting all of the Halloween programming you'll be seeing over the next three weeks, from Fox's annual Treehouse of Horror episode of \"The Simpsons\" at 8 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 25, on Channel 8 -- preceded by a special Halloween story on Sunday, Oct. 18 -- to the annual showing of \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" at 8 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 20, on WEWS Channel 5.\nAnd during this stretch, you're not even safe on PBS. \"Secrets of the Dead\" is airing an episode about vampire secrets at 9 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 27.\nIn \"The Raven,\" Edgar Allan Poe has the narrator call his dwelling \"this home by horror haunted.\" He might have been describing American television in 2015.\nThe remarkable thing is not only how many horror shows are on the air, but how many of them are frightfully good. While, of course, there are some lesser efforts in the ghoulish group, several rank among the best shows of the season.\nMany of these shows are being crafted by writers and producers keenly aware of their prime-time predecessors. They proudly embrace the influences of the classic anthology shows (\"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Thriller\" and \"The Outer Limits\"), as well as such diverse series as \"Dark Shadows,\" \"Night Gallery,\" \"Kolchak: The Night Stalker,\" \"Twin Peaks,\" \"The X-Files\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\nWhy is horror riding so high right now? Some will say it's because of tough times and uncertain world conditions. Some will say it's because the expanding TV landscape has given storytellers more freedom to use horror in powerful, metaphoric ways.\nWhatever the reason, you're starting to see horror creep its way into all kinds of programming formats. The humor-horror hybrids, for instance, include ABC's \"Scream Queens,\" which premiered Sept. 22; MTV's \"Scream,\" returning for a second season next year; and Starz's upcoming \"Ash vs. Evil Dead,\" which premieres at 9 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31. Yes, there are shows that want you screaming with laughter as well as fright.\nGame shows and TV newsmagazines, too, are hopping on board the horror hearse. GSN has \"Hellevator,\" a horror-themed game show premiering at 8 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 21. Investigation Discovery has \"True Nightmares,\" with host Todd Robbins exploring actual murder and mayhem stories that spawned urban legends.\nWhen it reaches that point, one might hear the echo of a line delivered by Elsa Lanchester, playing Mary Shelley in the prologue to the 1935 horror classic \"Bride of Frankenstein\": \"It's a perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:17:59.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
