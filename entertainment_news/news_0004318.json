Today, I'm excited to reveal that film was only the beginning of an epic new entertainment universe. \"As a lifelong fan of these characters, I've always wanted to see the ultimate showdown, and today we're pleased to be announcing that and more.\" \n© Getty Images Warner Bros' Kevin Tsujihara added: \"Working with our partners at Legendary, we enjoyed tremendous creative and commercial success with Godzilla .\"It's great to be able to revisit these characters and help create a franchise with so many creative possibilities for filmmakers. Fans love these big, globally iconic films and it doesn't get any bigger than this.\"The current plan calls for Kong: Skull Island - starring Tom Hiddleston , Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson - to open on March 10, 2017, followed by Godzilla 2 on June 8, 2018.These movies come together for Godzilla vs King Kong in 2020 – although an exact date hasn't yet been set.Fans of Godzilla may remember that Legendary previously licenced the rights to use classic movie monsters Rodan, King Ghidorah and Mothra in future spinoffs as well.A Japanese version of King Kong vs Godzilla was released in 1962 – at the height of the '60s monster movie craze.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:09:34.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
