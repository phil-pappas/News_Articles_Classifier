Marine Science Center director Maria Procopio told city officials the new building would be 5,000 square feet in size, but with an added 5,000 square feet of usable space.\nThe building, she said, would feel like a “natural space on a barrier island,” with views of the dunes and the shipping channel from three overlooks.\nThe new building would also feature an amphitheater for programs and nano walls for expanding its classrooms.\nThe estimated cost for construction, she said, is about $2 million. Another $2 million would be needed to fund exhibits, equipment, furnishings and fixtures.\nDuring a workshop at the existing Marine Science Center on Friday, Procopio presented the council with two options for funding the construction of the new building. One was based entirely on contributions, and the other relied on a mix of special purpose local option sales tax funds for the building, and contributions for future exhibits, furnishings and fixtures.\nThe preferred funding proposal was the use of SPLOST, she said, because it would get the work done more quickly and at a less expensive cost.\nThere is a catch, however, Tybee Mayor Jason Buelterman said.\nAlthough there are funds set aside for “beach improvements,” in the current SPLOST, they were set aside by Chatham County as a contribution to the recent beach renourishment project. There are funds left over from the project, he said, but it’s up to the county to determine how to spend them. So if Tybee officials opt to go for the second option, they would need to get the blessing of Chatham County officials, the mayor said.\nThe City Council will likely meet again in the coming weeks to discuss their options for funding the project, and how it ranks and priority among other city projects, Buelterman said.\nFor many council members attending a workshop on the future space, the project ranks fairly high. Now celebrating its 25th anniversary on the island, the Marine Science Center long ago outgrew the space it currently occupies on the south end of the island near the Walter Parker Pier.\nIn 2014, Procopio said, the facility’s Coastal Georgia Gallery saw 28,000 visitors. The Center had some 22,000 Georgia students participate in its Sidewalk to Sea program.\nAll together, she said, more than 44,000 people participated in the Marine Science Center’s group and island visitors programs last year.\nOnce the facility moves to a larger space, Procopio said, the plan is to grow its programming to include coastal culture. The center would also work in conjunction with other attractions in the area like the Tybee Island Light Station and Museum, she said, “and let the south end stay the party place.”\n“We’ll do more of what we do because what we do, we do well,” Procopio said. “But we want to expand our programming up there.”\nCouncil members Wanda Doyle, Barry Brown and Monty Parks were supportive of moving forward with relocating the facility. The project has been on the books for a long time, Doyle said, and it’s time to wrap it up.\nCouncilman Bill Garbett cautioned that once the new building is built on the north end, Marine Science Center staff will need to cover their own operating expenses moving forward.\nParks said he had no doubt they will.\n“I have loved this building, and this project since I was on the planning commission,” Parks said. “I think it’s going to be a tremendous success.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14815624.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14815624.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14815599.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14815599.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:12:53.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
