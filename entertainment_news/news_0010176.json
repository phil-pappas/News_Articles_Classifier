Eliminated X Factor contestant Jimmy Davis pictured with host Luke Jacobz, left, and mentor Chris Isaak. Channel 7 Cars For Sale \nX FACTOR evictee Jimmy Davis has apologised for comments he made about the show yesterday. \nThe Cooran singer slammed the reality singing contest as a game show in several media interviews. \n\"I forget the weight of my words and how they can affect and sometimes even hurt those I care most about,\" Davis said in a post on Facebook . \n\"As you may be aware, I have a somewhat independent personality. I've always been one to speak my mind and this can be confronting at times. The most recent media article is a perfect example of this. From what I believed started as a very casual conversation with a laid back journalist became a tainted farewell and left a bitter taste in my mouth.\" \nDavis was more positive in his interview with APN , and thanking all of the local support he has received on the Sunshine Coast and in Gympie, where he was born. \nIn his lengthy Facebook post he was keen to express his gratitude for his time on the show and the exposure he has gained as a musician. \n\"Some things were taken out of context and people who I respect have been hurt; and most importantly, it has given off the impression that I am not grateful for all the opportunities that X Factor has given to me,\" he said. \n\"The show has been an absolutely life-changing experience for me. I have learned so much in the past few months, not only about my chosen craft but also about myself as a person.\" \nHe also thanked his celebrity mentor Chris Isaak, who is coaching the Under 25 Boys category. \n\"Working with you has been one of the most inspiring and exhilarating experiences of my entire life,\" Davis said. \n\"All the stories you have shared, the advice you have given me and the down to earth way you see the world has resonated with me. It has been an absolute pleasure working with you and will always be a highlight of my life.\" channel 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:43:07.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
