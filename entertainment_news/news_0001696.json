Whoâ€™s been filming the fugitives?! Who's filming the people being #Hunted must be hard to hide with a film crew following you. ðŸ˜± \nâ€” PL (@paulzim) October 15, 2015 \nItâ€™s the same question people have been asking since the first week of Hunted â€“ doesnâ€™t walking around with a camera crew seriously hamper your chances of escaping? Well, yeah, it probably does, but the majority of the fugitives who got caught in the first few weeks made other mistakes which led the hunters to them. \nThe camera crew probably doesnâ€™t help, but the fugitivesâ€™ own mistakes are more important. 2. Are these guys going to receive some support after the show? #Hunted is so intense. How is this even psychologically acceptable? Promoted stories \nâ€” Kirsty Stewart (@Gingee_) October 15, 2015 \nWe know itâ€™s only a TV programme and these people put themselves up for it, but there has to be some sort of psychological price for spending 28 days constantly looking over your shoulder. The hunters eluded to as much, saying the fugitives would be feeling intense anxiety and paranoia â€“ and with some of them it was quite apparent. 3. Why on earth are you STILL using a phone? Haven't you learnt anything, Emily? #Hunted pic.twitter.com/FTgh2js9rm \nâ€” Hunted HQ (@Hunted_HQ) October 15, 2015 \nEmily very nearly got herself â€“ and, in the process, everyone else â€“ caught by using an acquaintanceâ€™s phone to ring her family. Itâ€™s almost as if people hadnâ€™t been getting caught for this exact same reason since the very first week! 4. How did they find people before social media? How did these security services hunt for fugitives before twitter, Facebook and email? #milkcarton #Hunted \nâ€” Dave I (@DangerousPaddy) October 15, 2015 \nIf you were planning on committing a crime that might cause you to flee your home, 2015 is not the year to do it. Youâ€™re at least 15 years too late. The hunters seemed to find everything they needed from looking through Facebook friends and hacking into Twitter accounts. Delete. Them. All. 5. How did Emily do it? Is Emily a genius or a madwoman?! I really can't call it anymore #Hunted \nâ€” Louise Coyne (@bantasaurus_rex) October 15, 2015 \nEmily, more than the other three who made it, always seemed right on the verge of being caught. But her movements were random enough to evade the hunters â€“ just about â€“ and we still donâ€™t know whether it was pure luck or there was some serious planning going on. 6. Also, where did she find all those people?! AS IF that random woman who Emily has only just met has give her the keys to her daughters house ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ who are these people?! #Hunted \nâ€” Oli Sproates (@OliSproatesLFC5) October 15, 2015 \nWe mentioned the woman who allowed Emily to use her phone, but that same person also put Emily up for a bit in her house. And, even stranger, when it became apparent Emily couldnâ€™t stay there any longer, Dawn drove her down to her daughterâ€™s uni house in Canterbury and handed her the keys. 7. How did they know where Lauren was? How on earth did #hunted know where to do the wanted posters for Lauren? Bit dodgy that. \nâ€” Michael Mumford (@m1cky83) October 15, 2015 \nThere came a point when the hunters had exhausted all their options regarding most of the fugitives, and so they decided to put their pictures on wanted posters in newspapers, the internet and in town centres. \nBut that doesnâ€™t explain how one of the posters came to be in the closest town to where Lauren was staying, a secluded house up a hill in a very quiet part of Wales. And the poster was just there?! Suspicious. 8. Why did they all leave from the same place? Why give them the same extraction point? #Hunted \nâ€” Ashley Firth (@AshFirth30) October 15, 2015 \nThe great thing about Hunted had been that all the fugitives were able to make their own way, doing what they decided was best and travelling wherever they thought they wouldnâ€™t be found. \nThat changed slightly in the final episode though, with all four remaining fugitives having to travel to an airfield in Surrey to board a plane. It mightâ€™ve been a bit more realistic had they been able to make their own way out of the country. As it turns out, it didnâ€™t matter, but it so almost didâ€¦ 9. Why, Jack? WHY?! \nâ€” evie frye (@mollyhmc) October 15, 2015 \nRemember the random uni house Emily was staying in? The hunters eventually found their way there and were determined to find Emily. One of the residents, a student called Jack, decided to accept the Â£250 offered by the hunters and told them she was heading to a specific part of Surrey. This happened to be the same place all of the fugitives were heading, so Jack almost ruined their whole month for Â£250. \nWe guess that *is* an awful lot of Jaeger bombs, thoughâ€¦ 10. What were they supposed to do? How are you meant to beat the manifest? #hunted \nâ€” Mike Kingscott (@mkingscott) October 15, 2015 \nWeâ€™re convinced that were it not for the pre-planned extraction point, the hunters would have had no clue the fugitives had even left the country. Sure, they might have found Emily, due to Jackâ€™s big mouth, but if Stephen, Martin and Lauren had been able to plan the final part of their escape, theyâ€™d likely have continued to be as elusive as theyâ€™d proven over the month as a whole. Share article \nThe fact that the fugitivesâ€™ real names were on the flight manifest â€“ not provided like that by the fugitives â€“ was the biggest factor helping the hunters. Had that not been the case, the hunters probably wouldnâ€™t have gotten close in the end.
