We rejoin them as they return to camp where Jeff is just happy to be there, believing his temper earlier in the day and his attempt to communicate with a former tribemate had doomed him. \nThe only problem now is that because Jeff went against his alliance to vote with Tasha, Andrew and Abi, he's now indebted to them. But he shouldn't worry. Abi is running hot and on target. When she sees Tasha talking to Woo, she flips out. Woo has tried to vote her off twice and Abi doesn't appreciate anyone even talking to him. If the decision was up to her, she would send him home next. \nOn Bayon, Jeremy is celebrating in private because during the last immunity challenge, he made a bold move and grabbed a hidden immunity idol right under everyone's noses. Fish, who is second behind Abi in the paranoia arena, is frantic to find a hidden idol and Jeremy does a very convincing job of steering him up trees and down rivers, making him believe that Jeremy is just as committed to finding that darn thing as Fish is. \nBack at Angkor, everyone is unhappy with the new camp, which is compared to a dead cove, \"Survivor\" ghetto and hell. There's no fish, no shelter, no nothing. But good news. There's a reward challenge ahead and some people will have a chance to eat actual food. Reward Challenge Advertisement The task is to wade out into the water to retrieve a sand bag, return to shore and then use a plank to launch the bag into an overhead basket. First place wins a barbecue setup and food. Second place gets a smaller version and third gets nothing. The twist is that each tribe must pick one person to compete, turning this into a hero challenge. \nAngkor picks Andrew, Bayon picks Jeremy and Ta Keo picks Terry. Andrew falls behind but when Jeremy and Terry have trouble sinking their second bags, Andrew catches up, and eventually wins first, even though it appears to almost kill him. Terry wins second place for Ta Keo. \nAndrew feels that he's been vindicated. He gave his all for the tribe. Now, his tribe knows that they can compete against the big horses on the other tribes. Well, maybe. \nSpeaking of the other tribes, life is laid back at Ta Keo. Everyone is snoozing except for Kass, who has become a student of using self-help methods to make her more likable, and doing some DIY. She strings beads into what Kelley, who spots her, thinks is a fake idol. But Kaos Kass really is making a good-luck charm for Kelly, who feels a little embarrassed by what she'd been thinking. \nAt Bayon, everyone is working. Jeremy asks Spencer what's up with Wigglesworth. Because he and Wigglesworth are in the minority in the tribe, Spencer happily bad mouths Wigglesworth, telling them how she is tight with Woo and Jeff, and will rejoin her original alliance whenever there's a merge. \nMonica isn't sure she trusts Spencer, but you can't tell. She's going to play and see what happens. Immunity challenge This is an oldie but a goody. One tribe member acts as caller, directing blindfolded tribemates to find and move giant puzzle pieces. They must locate and carry them back to their mats, and once the 16 pieces are collected, they can remove the blindfolds and assemble the pieces into a cube replica of their flags. \nIt's a comedy of errors with Keith unable to hear directions, Terry wandering around waiting for someone to tell him where to go, and people dropping heavy puzzle pieces on each other. Joe single-handedly saves Ta Keo from last place by finding and carrying bunches of pieces by himself. \nBayon finishes first and Angkor sort of gives up, allowing Ta Keo to take second. Yep, Angkor is going back to Tribal Council for the second time in a row. Andrew tells Jeff Probst that's it's scary. He's so exhausted that he can't even think straight. In fact, he can barely get the words out. \nProbst tell him he wishes he could send them back to camp with something, but he can't, only his halfhearted sympathy. Thanks Probst. \nAngkor limps back to camp. They are exhausted and emotionally spent. \nAndrew and Tasha have a plan to vote Jeff off, but they can't rely on Abi not to flip back. They want to keep Abi from talking to Jeff, but that's exactly what Jeff is planning to do. \nWoo talks to Abi and butters her up, telling her that she's the one in power. Abi's still nursing her anger against Woo for having the nerve to write her name down, twice. \nAbi tells Tasha she wants to vote off Woo, but Tasha is set on Jeff. Woo will help them win challenges, not that they've won any. But Abi says Jeff has been nice to her, so they should keep him. Jeff doesn't manage any alone time with Abi, but with Tasha standing guard, Jeff tells her how much he misses his \"Abi time.\" Yes, that's what he said. We wouldn't torture you with something like that. \nTasha thinks they may have to let Abi have her way or she'll flip out again. Tribal council Jeff is walking with a cane, which ever alert Probst points out. One of the pieces fell on his little toe, Jeff says, and he's injured. \nAbi volunteers that the vote tonight is between Woo and Jeff, and she hasn't made up her mind yet. Woo and Jeff then take turns tossing each other under the bus, and Jeff is a master tosser. Woo says they need him to win challenges; Jeff says Woo has voted against the alliance, lighting the very short fuse that is a Abi by noting that Woo voted for Abi. Twice, Abi reminds us. \nJeff sells his loyalty and love of all things Abi. Woo tries to make a case for himself. Before the vote, he promises Abi that he'll stay loyal to her, and Abi tells him to be sure not to write down her name, because, you know, that would be for the third time. And he doesn't, but we so wish he would have. \nThe votes are for Jeff and Woo, but they fall against Jeff, who hugs Abi and calls her a little bitch, but in an endearing way. Abi flashes a heart sign at him as his torch is snuffed and he limps off.
