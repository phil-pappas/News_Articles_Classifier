Angelo Mastropietro inside the house Angelo Mastropietro in the kitchen \nDespite being in an 800-year-old abandoned cave, the new home is fitted with electricity, running water, underfloor heating and even wi-fi. \nThe unusual living space, in Low Habberley, near Kidderminster, recently featured on the Channel 4 show Grand Designs and took eight months to become home for Angelo.

What do you think? Be the first to comment Angelo Mastropietro with planning officer Emma Anning \nAngelo said: “My family comes from Italy where there is a tradition of cave dwellings and ironically our surname Mastropietro translates into ‘Master of the stone’. I was not particularly daunted by the idea of carving a home out of rock – I felt emotionally attached to the project from the start.” \nAngelo bought the 2.5 acre site for £62,000 and submitted a planning application to Wyre Forest District Council in March 2014 to turn the derelict cave dwelling into a one-bedroom retreat. \nPlanning officer Emma Anning took on this case and was instrumental in bringing this project fruition along with colleagues from Water Management and the Ranger service. \nThe application was approved following various ecological and biodiversity surveys to ensure surroundings were not affected. \nMore than 70 tonnes of rock was excavated from the stone to provide space to make a home suited for the 21st century. \nThe project took just eight months to complete. \nWork on the external rock face was kept to a minimum to sustain the natural look and the windows were all handmade in oak. \nShe said: \"It is always good to work on something that isn’t quite the norm and this certainly wasn’t that. \n\"This was my first cave house so assessing the merits of the proposal against the development plan was a new challenge.\" \nAngelo said: \"The work was a labour of love and I was determined to transform this forgotten cave into something special. \n\"It is estimated that the cave is over 250 million years old and I think we can safely say it will outlive many of the new homes being built today.\" \nReceive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
