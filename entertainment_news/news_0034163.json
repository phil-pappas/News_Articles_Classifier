The University Musical Society production, based on a new translation by Canadian poet Anne Carson, will mark the actress’s first visit to the Michigan and the chance of theatergoers to see one of the world’s best actresses in a work of timeless power.\nJuliette Binoche won a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in \"The English Patient.\" (Photo: Miramax)\nBelieved to be written around 440 BC, “Antigone” opens with the admission by the title character that she has committed a crime that will lead to almost certain death. She has buried her brother, Polyneikes, against the direct orders of her uncle, the Theban King Kreon, who insists that the traitor be left to rot.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nDarren Criss shares University of Michigan memories\nBinoche knows a thing or two about standing up for her beliefs, having spoken out on a slate of civil rights issues, including the plight of undocumented workers in France and the detention and later exile of Iranian director Jafar Panahi by the Iranian government.\nSpeaking by phone from Paris, Binoche talked to the Free Press about her long and varied career, political activism and the classical play that she has been wanting to make for years.\nQUESTION: So how did this production of 'Antigone’ come about?\nANSWER: The head of the theater in Luxembourg had wanted to do something with me, a big international project, so I said \"why not?\" Early on we spoke about Greek tragedies, and two names kept coming up. He kept saying \"Elektra\" and I kept saying \"Antigone,\" because it’s a play that’s not very much done. Still we couldn’t find a really good translation. We read a part of one by Anne Carson, and loved it so much we asked her to do the entire play. She said \"yes.\"\nQ: Why this play? Why now?\nA: With this and with \"Oedipus\" (the story of Antigone’s fated father, also by Sophocles), the myth hides the knowledge that’s more than just a tale. It’s about the possible transformation of human beings. It’s old and ancient, part of the tradition, but tradition in this case has nothing to do with the past. It is beyond past. It’s a teaching of what we as human beings have to see or recognize or be in touch with. Antigone’s role is to go back to the high principles of life, that's why she talks about God, because she’s in touch with the unwritten, unfaltering, unshakable ordinance of the Gods. She doesn’t want to die, but she needs to heal those things that are out of place.\nFor Antigone, this decision to act comes from her heart, from the need of being a sister, a human being who has dignity. It’s not out of pride, not out of trying to show the world something. It comes from \"this is wrong,\" this need to do this; otherwise I’m not a human being.\nJuliette Binoche (center) stars in \"Antigone.\" (Photo: Jan Versweyveld)\nQ: You have played so many different kinds of roles. One day we see you as Camille Claudel. The next you are in the cast of “Godzilla.” How deliberate are you in choosing roles?\nA: For me it’s about the experience of something new. In the case of \"Godzilla,\" it was because the director wrote me a letter and met with me and I liked him. You’re choosing out of feelings, whether you like someone or have some kind of intuition. The choices have to come from a secret place. … There may be a plan in my life, in the way I choose these roles, but if so I’m not aware of it.\nQ: What do you draw from your own life in bringing a character like Antigone to the stage?\nA: I try to be aware of the stories of other people, try to understand what exactly they are going through … With Antigone, she is taking things in, like what we’re trying to do in life when we go to psychotherapy. We try to understand what is in our past that is not working or when we try to go through an emotional challenge that will take us to a higher place. As an actress, you have to go through that journey of emotion and then transform that emotion, because acting at its core is really about transformation.\nQ: In your role as an activist, have you ever had what you would call an \"Antigone\" moment of heroic rebellion?\nA: You have to be very cautious about what you are doing for charity and things like that. I think you have to start with your life. I think that’s what life is expecting you to do. In your family, in your surroundings, in your work life, in the people you’re with, your relationships; how you behave and doing what you need to accomplish. That for me is being a hero every day of your life.\n'Antigone'\n7:30 p.m. Wed.-Thu.; 8 p.m. Fri.-Sat.\nUniversity Musical Society\nPower Center\n121 Fletcher St., Ann Arbor\n734-764-2538\n$35-$75", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799922079847050-Antigone-10-by-Jan-Versweyveld.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89142061e0d583e31dd644cefc694206cba70241/c=711-0-1911-1600&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799922079847050-Antigone-10-by-Jan-Versweyveld.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7cf918ad764736504aac3d695ba41da7799e7275/c=0-0-1281-963&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799922058474913-The-ENGLISH-PATIENT.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799922058474913-The-ENGLISH-PATIENT.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5fe67170263a199f952049190468108876d0927/c=0-166-2259-1442&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799988403387881-GTY-491479946.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9504bd23c6952d902dfb3cc189a32ea2456a151/r=500x334/local/-/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799922058474913-The-ENGLISH-PATIENT.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635799922079847050-Antigone-10-by-Jan-Versweyveld.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:49:10.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
