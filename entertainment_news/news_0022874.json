But will he succeed?\n- Blue birds in forest -\nView gallery French cartoon artist Albert Uderzo poses with people dressed as Asterix and Obelix characters, in P … The comic book abounds with winks and nods to modern technology, such as the blue birds in the forest reminiscent of the Twitter symbol.\nThe new adventures come two years after the Gallic duo re-emerged from an eight-year absence in \"Asterix and the Picts\", which took them to ancient Scotland for the first time and sold over 5.4 million copies in 15 countries and more than 20 languages and dialects.\nThe Asterix series -- created by illustrator Albert Uderzo and writer Rene Goscinny in 1959 -- is a bestseller in the comic book world, with some 365 million copies sold worldwide.\nOver the years, the two characters from ancient Gaul have met Cleopatra, drunk tea with the English, taken part in the Olympic Games, and eaten countless roast boar.\nWith the help of a Druid-brewed magic potion that grants them superhuman strength, they have also taken great pleasure in beating up scores of Romans.\nThe series has been adapted into live-action films and is the inspiration for a popular theme park, Parc Asterix, outside Paris.\nIt has always been a hugely intimate affair and Uderzo, now 88, took over the writing after Goscinny died in 1977.\nHe quit drawing in 2011, and \"Asterix and the Picts\" was the first of the books to be written and illustrated by two entirely new people -- Ferri and illustrator Didier Conrad, who continued their collaboration for \"Asterix and the Missing Scroll\".\nArts & Entertainment Books & Publishing Julian Assange Asterix and the Missing Scroll", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:08:03.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
