Well, the world will have to keep wondering because the actress played coy when asked about the rumors on Tuesday's Watch What Happens Live . \n\"I don't like addressing any kind of gossip,\" Hudson said when a viewer called in asking what was on everyone's mind. \n\"I mean, my agent [Michael Kives] has been my mystery man maybe 25 times,\" she continued. \"Honestly, you can't hug someone or talk to someone without it ending up being a thing.\" \nRumors began in September after the two were spotted together at Disney World and Hudson, according to TMZ , attended Jonas' show at the House of Blues in Orlando later that day. The next day, they were photographed having brunch together in Miami. \nIf they were to start dating, there would be a bit of an age gap: Nick is 23 and Kate is 36. \nIt's interesting to note that while Hudson was filming WWHL in New York City Tuesday night, Jonas also was in the Big Apple -- performing at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. \nJonas previously has been linked to Olivia Culpo and was rumored to be dating Kendall Jenner, but he quickly dispelled those rumors. Hudson split with her fianc√©, Muse frontman Matt Bellamy, late last year. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:43:41.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
