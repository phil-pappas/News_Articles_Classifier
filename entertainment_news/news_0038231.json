The British redhead revealed in a recent interview that some of the best performances he'd ever played happened while he's hung over. \"I think it's just because you walk onstage, you're not complacent, you're not onstage being like, 'Oh, I've done this a million times.' You walk onstage being like, 'You know, I'm 90 per cent the human I should be so I'll make sure I give 115 per cent,' \" he said. Those concerts he played while having a hangover included ones taking place at Wembley Stadium in London last summer. He \"made sure\" he went out for drinks the night before his three sold-out gigs at the venue, which were recorded for his concert film \" Jumpers for Goalposts \". The film premiered earlier this week at Leicester Square and is screened in selected theaters across the world until Sunday, October 25. Explaining his decision to make a concert film, Sheeran said that he got inspired by Justin Bieber 's \" Never Say Never \". \"I just find whenever I'm on a British Airlines flight I always watch someone's concert film... I was never really a fan of Justin Bieber, and then I watched 'Never Say Never' and then it made sense, so I was like, 'Oh, oh. I get it now,' \" he said and jokingly added, \"So I wanted to make a film that I could put on British Airlines flights and have Chinese businessmen like my music.\" In the interview, Sheeran also said that Spotify was one of the things that gave him a chance to perform at the iconic Wembley Stadium. Unlike his BFF Taylor Swift who pulled her entire catalog after complaining about the small amount of money artists get from streaming their music on the service, Sheeran didn't really mind the money he earned from Spotify. \"The Spotify thing is a weird argument,\" he shared. \"A lot of people go on about the financial thing with Spotify and I definitely do agree with that for small artists and writers who are looking to get checks and stuff like that, but I think if you're a big touring artist you shouldn't really complain about it because I can now tour all around the world doing stadiums from Spotify.\" \"I can go to Norway and Iceland and Thailand, just like random places where CD sales are not prevalent... So Spotify, for me, it works, because I am a touring act,\" he continued. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:06:25.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
