The soundtrack maintains a striking balance with the plot, with mostly situational songs comprising the album. It opens with Meet Bros Anjjan's (MBA) groovy beach party number Awesome Mora Mahiya, which has a fresh vibe and zesty rendition by Khushboo Grewal. The singer and MBA, along with Neha Kakkar, conjure up an upbeat inspirational song We Will Rock The World. The mukhda has its share of snappy moments, and this dreamy desire number is a befitting background score to the film. Coming close on the heels of his Hero success, Amaal Mallik once again emerges as the star of the album with the twin versions of Khwaishein sung by Arijit Singh and Armaan Malik respectively. While Arijit's powerful voice adds the required zing to the rock version, Armaan's sharp sense of melody is impressive in the unplugged one. Amaal plays out the strengths of his artistes and uses that to the advantage of the track. He thrives with Khwaishein. However, the passable Shaadi Wali Night, which is meant to be naughty and peppy, isn't in the same league. Aditi Singh Sharma's seductive voice and Amaal's vanilla blend of desi beats and Western vibe are the highlights. Overall, Calendar Girls uses formula tunes to deliver bang-for-your-buck chartbusters. .\nLISTEN: Songs of Calendar Girls on Gaana.com\nWATCH: Madhur Bhandarkar's Calendar Girl Kyra Dutt was also one of Vijay Mallya's Calendar Girls - TOI", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FHotyF9dVQ", "http://gaana.com/search/albums/Calendar%20Girls"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:21:57.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
