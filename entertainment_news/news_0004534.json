Sader’s work is part of the Resident Printmakers Exhibit on display in the Corridor Gallery, and her talk will begin at 7 p.m. at the arts center, 256 High St. All are welcome; admission is by donation at the door. \nSader is a printmaker, painter and environmental site-specific installation artist. As a printmaker, she uses nontoxic, health and environment friendly printmaking methods, which she helped research at the University of Maine. She studied printmaking under Susan Groce, UMO; Elizabeth Dove, University of Montana; Hester Stinnett, Tyler University, Philadelphia; and Deer Isle’s Siri Beckman. In addition to showing her work locally, nationally and internationally, she gives presentations on her work and teaches nontoxic printmaking techniques. \nSader’s work can be seen through Nov. 25; gallery hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by appointment; to arrange, call 338-2222.
