SG Blackbeard creeps up on Peter Pan Sg Blackbeard and his motley crew \n“Blackbeard is a troubled guy, in search of eternal youth and capricious in the extreme”, says director Joe Wright. \n“One minute, he’ll be charming and funny, the next he’s throwing someone off a plank.” \nIt's a huge change for an actor who is still best known for playing the dour and grumpy Wolverine, although Jackman recently named Tom Hardy as his successor to play Wolverine in the X-Men films . \nClearly Jackman is having a ball with his new role. \nThe Aussie star says that it’s his character's unhinged exuberance which “made him such a fun character to play.” SG Pan and Hook as you've never seen them before \nIn a toweringly terrific OTT performance Jackman’s Blackbeard gleefully terrorizes the whole of Neverland. \nThese leaves us with a very unlikely hero as Garrett Hedlund’s youthful Hook deploys bags of charm and chutzpah to win us over. \nHe teams up with Peter (Levi Miller) and Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) as they take us on a new adventure through Neverland. \nOne thing never changes, though – just keep an eye out for those giant crocodiles… \nPan is released in cinemas October 16, with previews on October 10 and 11.
