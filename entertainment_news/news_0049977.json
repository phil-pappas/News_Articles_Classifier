Cary Joji Fukunaga ’s film will be released simultaneously in theaters and on Netflix (a first for the video-on-demand service), which bought worldwide distribution rights in March.\nBridge of Spies: Talk about a dicey assignment: Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan ( Tom Hanks ) is tasked with negotiating the release of pilot Francis Gary Powers , whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, touching off a Cold War firestorm. The cloak-and-dagger trailer suggests Donovan’s chances of survival, much less success, aren’t very good. The film’s all-star team includes director Steven Spielberg and writers Joel and Ethan Coen .\nCrimson Peak: Don’t marry dudes who live in scary old mansions. That seems to be the moral of this tale from the fertile, fevered mind of writer/director Guillermo Del Toro . In the late 19th century, a young author (Mia Wasikowska) falls for the dashing Sir Thomas Sharpe ( Tom Hiddleston ), then discovers that he and his sister ( Jessica Chastain ) are hiding something concerning the mansion’s sordid past. This one has been in development a long time; Del Toro reportedly wrote the screenplay nine years ago.\nFreeheld: A 2007 Oscar-winning documentary short about terminally ill New Jersey police officer Laurel Hester ’s fight to allow her pension benefits to be transferred to her partner, Stacie Andree , gets the feature-film treatment. Julianne Moore and Ellen Page portray Hester (who died in 2006 at 49) and Andree, respectively. The film debuted to mixed reviews in September at the Toronto International Film Festival.\nGoodnight Mommy: Austrian horror film involves twins whose mother begins acting strangely after returning from cosmetic surgery. Since her head is bandaged — only her mouth and eyes are visible — they begin to wonder if it’s really Mom in there. Nominated for a foreign-language Oscar in 2014, the film is getting good reviews (80 Tomatometer score) since its limited release in September.\nGoosebumps: A generation of kids grew up reading R.L. Stine’s books; who knew the monsters he wrote about were real, and that he kept them locked in his books to protect his young readers? Jack Black is Stine; Dylan Minnette is Zach Cooper , who has the daunting task of getting the monsters back into their books after he accidentally releases them.\nWoodlawn: Sounds like a faith-based “Remember the Titans,” with its mix of high school football, racial tension and a spiritual message. Like “Titans,” it’s a based-on-truth saga, as an Alabama team led by star African American back Tony Nathan (Caleb Castille) begins an unlikely playoff run.\nOct. 23\nBurnt\nJem and the Holograms\nThe Last Witch Hunter\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\nRock the Kasbah\nSteve Jobs\nOct. 30\nOur Brand Is Crisis\nScouts Guide the the Zombie Apocalypse\nNov. 6\nOutskirts\nThe Peanuts Movie\nSpectre\nRobert Johnson\nSource: Boxofficemojo.com", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/73/36/8632204/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/73/36/8632204/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:34:46.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
