When asked to name his favorite Marvel superhero at a campaign event in Las Vegas, Bush struggled for a minute, according to CNN, then tried to wiggle free using his powers of Republicanism. \"I like watching the movies. I wish I owned Marvel, as someone that believes in capitalism,\" Bush said.\nRealizing his answer was not sufficiently geeky, Bush tried again. \"I don't know, I'm kinda old school,\" he said. \"I like the old school guys like Batman, a little dark these days.\" (For the stereotypical jocks in the audience, Batman is the most famous non-Marvel superhero.)\nThen Bush tried again, saying he saw a commercial for the new CBS show Supergirl while he was working out earlier in the day. Give the man two points for naming a Marvel character and a current TV show! Then get ready to take them both away. \"She looked kinda ... she looked pretty hot,\" Bush said. \"I don't know which channel it's on, but I'm looking forward to that.\"\nHere's video, for those who have a hard time imagining Bush commenting on someone's hotness.", "external_links": ["http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/oct/21/in-nevada-jeb-bush-calls-supergirl-hot-and-argues/", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/politics/jeb-bush-marvel-superhero-las-vegas/", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/fO_gKb9dOi4?html5=1", "http://www.eonline.com/news/68923/barack-obama-commander-in-geek"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:05:27.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
