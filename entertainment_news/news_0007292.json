Hours later a third man - the boy's uncle - suffered the same fate.\nThree days into the trial of 37 suspects, the prosecutor asked for a life of hard labour for 12 of the 14 people who are being prosecuted for kidnapping and murder - the maximum sentence in Madagascar, which has abolished the death penalty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:03:13.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
