The game isn’t just “Free-to-Play” like other online games - through January 1st, the only currency accepted is acts of kindness and other social good you can do in game. Players do things like helping friends or family, being green, doing chores, and writing messages to sick children, among many others. If players perform 1,000,000 good deeds total by year end, A Better World will release funds to provide new coats for children in need nationwide through Operation Warm.\nA Better World is a game on Facebook that has always been free-to-play, but extras within the game such as special clothing, accessories, and pets have been available for purchase. Now, those extras can be obtained exclusively with virtual currency called Do-Good Gold which is earned within the game by doing good deeds. Additionally, as part of the goal to bring the world together in doing good, A Better World has added in-game language translations for all player posts in the do-good areas of the game, allowing them to share their good acts around the globe.\nA Better World is a fun way to do good. Players can dress up, take care of pets, and decorate virtual homes, in addition to completing acts of kindness. Players work together to meet do-good goals that, when met, release money to charities. A Better World calls this Cause Gaming®.\n“The holiday season is a time for coming together and giving back and we want to do our part here at A Better World,” said A Better World President and COO MarySue Hansell. “We’re excited to unleash the power of A Better World to help make the world a better place.” The team at A Better World believes the game will help cultivate attitudes of gratitude and will show players that doing good means feeling good.\nThe company is currently seeking investors and corporate partners that resonate with their mission to use the imaginative, interactive, and immersive power of games to change the world.
