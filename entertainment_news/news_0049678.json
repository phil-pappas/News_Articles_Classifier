A decade after serving 13 months in federal prison, Kerman, author of “Orange Is the New Black,” a memoir about her time locked up that was adapted for a Netflix series by the same name, spoke Wednesday at Elon University about her experiences. Kerman was among three authors speaking at Elon this fall as part of the university’s Liberal Arts Forum. On Wednesday evening, Kerman discussed the need for prison reform in the United States, home of “the world’s biggest prison population.” “The United States has 5 percent of the world’s population, but we have 25 percent of the world’s prisoners here,” Kerman said. She talked about the welcome she received from other women when she first arrived at Connecticut’s Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in 2004. “The last thing I expected on my first day of prison was to experience kindness at the hands of the other prisoners, but that is exactly what happened,” Kerman said, though later noting throughout her talk that even a minimum-security wing of a prison isn’t a walk in the park. “I recognized even then that this experience was going to be different than what I expected. I resolved to keep my eyes open and my mouth shut, which is the advice I’d give anyone … headed to prison or jail.” After being released from prison and immediately facing all sorts of questions from curious friends and family members, Kerman said she decided to write a memoir about her time that would allow the reader to “come away from the book with a different idea about who is in prison, … why are people locked up, why do we choose to lock people up, and what are the pathways people take into prison or jail? “I also hoped if I told the story the right way, in sort of a pop culture way, that I might be able to get someone to pick up a book about prison who might not otherwise read a book about prison. If we’re going to be the most incarcerated nation in human history, more people should think and talk about that.” Kerman cited a 650 percent increase in female incarceration in the United States over the past 30–40 years, rising from 500,000 prisoners in 1980 to 2.3 million today. During that time, the criminal justice system started to imprison people “that we never would have put in prison before.” Page 2 of 2 - Of the female prison population, two-thirds are being held for nonviolent crimes, Kerman said, and are “often very low-level offenders.” Women released from prison, many of whom are mothers, Kerman said, receive little to no help re-entering society, or assistance from the criminal justice system, with probation and parole often being “revolving doors in or out of prison or jail.” Kerman said that it takes programs like the Women’s Prison Association, for which she is on the board, to assist women with getting on their feet and out of the cycle of incarceration. “When a family loses a father to prison or jail, it’s devastating for that family,” Kerman said. “But when it’s a mother, the effects are seismic. We know kids are five times more likely go into foster care when we incarcerate the mother than when we incarcerate the father. We have to think long and hard about the offenses we incarcerate men and women for. We have to weigh what the value we think that punishment is against the harm that is caused to those families and communities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:58:22.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
