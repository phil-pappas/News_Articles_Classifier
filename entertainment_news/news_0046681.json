Following her appearance on \" Saturday Night Live \" this weekend, October 3, the singer shared more details about the trek, which will be launched in support of her and the band's collaborative album, \" Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz \". The tour is scheduled to open on November 19 at Chicago's Riviera Theatre. It will hit five other cities across the U.S. including Detroit, Washington, D.C., New York City and Philadelphia before being wrapped up at Boston's House of Blues on December 6. Tickets for all shows go on sale at Live Nation on October 7. \"Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz\" was released as a free album after Cyrus hosted the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards back in late August.
