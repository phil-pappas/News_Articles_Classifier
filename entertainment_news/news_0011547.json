[Rumors] Comment 0   \nAfter her breakup with rugby star Matt Janney, Emma Watson is reportedly back in the market and is dating close friend Roberto Aguirre. \nAccording to a report from the Latin Times , British star Emma Watson is dating her close friend Roberto Aguirre. The two have not confirmed the relationship but have been spotted around Los Angeles looking really close. Like Us on Facebook \nIn 2012, Aguirre spoke about the friendship he developed with the \"Regression\" star and said that she is one of his best friends. \n\"I was doing an internship in the special effects department at the time, and one day we had a chance encounter that led to us spending half a day together exchanging stories and dance moves. We never really lost touch after that and now she's one of my best friends,\" Aguirre said. \nThe 27-year-old actor and producer have been friends with Emma since they met in 2005. He was an intern in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" and they immediately hit it off after their first meeting. \nEven if the two are mum about the status of their relationship, Aguirre put on a display during Emma's birthday in April. After posting his birthday greeting to Emma, he finished it off by saying \"you mean the world to me\", which hinted that there could be something more between them. \nIn another report from Latin Post , Watson has expressed before that she was in a dark place after her breakup from Janney. \n\"I felt really uncomfortable, even before my relationship ended. I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself,\" she said. \nShe then went on and explained how her career affects her love life and vice versa. The actress admitted that being in a relationship really makes her vulnerable. The actress reportedly went in Canada's Rocky Mountain private facility for a week. This was due to the \"horrendous\" split with Janney that was confirmed in December of last year. The two were first linked early in 2014 and packed the year up with lots of holiday PDA. \nTo be fair, Watson said that her ex-boyfriends generally made her feel \"cherished.\" She previously said as well that she prefers dating \"regular guys\" rather than someone from the business but it seems like she might be going on a different route this time with Aguirre. \n\"They've built me up. I certainly haven't found that with doing all that I do or being all that I am, that I've struggled in my love life,\" Watson said.
