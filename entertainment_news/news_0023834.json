(AP) - The Bill Cosby sex-assault accusations have become a point of attack in one Pennsylvania political campaign.\nDemocrat Kevin Steele hopes to become the top prosecutor in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia. His opponent is Republican Bruce Castor, the former prosecutor who is trying to win back his old job.\nSteele's new ad attacks Castor for not charging Cosby in 2005 when a woman said the comedian had drugged and molested her. Dozens of women have since made similar claims.\nCastor calls the ad the work of a \"desperate candidate.\" He says he didn't have enough evidence to bring charges.\nThe case appears to have been reopened by the current prosecutor, and Steele is her top assistant. A defense lawyer says Cosby's camp recently contacted him about the inquiry.\nCosby has denied wrongdoing and settled the woman's civil lawsuit.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
