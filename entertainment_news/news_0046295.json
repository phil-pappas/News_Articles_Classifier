It's more the type of place to meet friends for a leisurely dinner than a go-to for a romantic date – mostly because couples are automatically seated at small and crowded tables for two. By the time the outstanding homemade bread arrives in an oversized basket, the table feels full. (And be careful of that tempting bread or you will feel full pretty quickly too.) The night we visited, the menu was in transition from their summer offerings to their winter ones, so there was a little bit of both sensibilities, which suited us just fine. We started with an order of oysters Rockefeller ($15) and a spinach and scallop salad ($13). The oysters were an original recipe that took us by surprise. They were topped with slightly sweet and buttery bread crumbs (perhaps made from that delicious house bread?). The crumbs were a nice crispy contrast to the tender fresh oysters. One suspects the spinach and scallop salad is a holdover from the summer offerings, but if so, it should definitely stay on the menu. The baby spinach was tossed with a warm bacon vinaigrette that had a nice acidic bite, but was also smooth. It was topped with bits of bacon, sautéed fennel and soft sun-dried tomatoes. The four scallops were seared to perfection. I would request a lighter hand with the dressing in the future, but that is just my preference. For my entrée, I chose the pan-seared halibut with orange beurre blanc ($34). The portion of fish was large and the halibut was nicely seared to give it a wonderful crust. It was slightly overcooked, which wouldn't have been as noticeable if the chef had been more generous with the orange beurre blanc. More sauce would have improved this dish greatly. It was served with a standard rice pilaf and pan-wilted baby spinach. My husband's short ribs with cheesy elbows ($28) featured an equally generous portion. The beef was pull-apart tender, but the mac and cheese was a little lost in the flavorful short rib sauce. More cheese might have helped, or perhaps the elbows should have been served slightly on the side. The rest of the presentation was beautiful with roasted asparagus resting on three corners of the dish. Against our better judgment and level of fullness, we decided to share bananas Foster ($10) for dessert. It was both delicious and ridiculous. Four people might have been able to make a dent in the serving size that appeared to include about a pint of ice cream, but we couldn't even finish a quarter. The wastefulness made us uneasy. Service was slow, which we might not have noticed if we were in a big group at a more comfortable table. Our waiter was dressed like a ship captain, complete with a captain's hat, which made him stand out from all the black-clad female servers. He was very friendly and fun. We left concluding that the staff is in as much of a transition as the menu between seasons. It's completely understandable to always seat deuces at tables for two in the busy season. But when you sit multiple couples at the smallest tables in your dining room when there are plenty of bigger tables available during their entire dining experience, it's time to give your staff an education on how to keep the year-round people happy too.
