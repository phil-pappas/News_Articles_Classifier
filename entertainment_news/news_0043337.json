(Photo captured using grabtool.) The Indiana first grader just got his picture taken for his school’s picture day. His outfit was carefully picked out, and it included one very special sweater– a sweater that has been worn by two previous generations of his family.\n“It’s just sort of known as ‘the sweater,’” said Brady’s father, Chuck Gose, who wore the sweater when he was in first grade in 1982.\nChuck’s uncle first wore the sweater for his own first grade picture day 1954, and later, the sweater was passed down to the younger brothers in that generation, including Chuck’s father.\nThis year– 61 years after it was worn for the first time– Brady donned the grey-knit sweater with pride.\n“My father passed away in 1999 before I was married and had children, so for me, this is a chance for my dad to live on through this tradition,\" Chuck told WRTV . \"It's also a chance for Brady to learn more about the grandfather he never got to know. When I handed it to him, he naturally asked a lot of questions about his grandpa. The two of them are actually pretty similar.\"\nChuck hopes Brady will pass on the sweater– and the tradition– to his future children.\nBoy becomes 5th person to wear 61-year-old ‘picture day' sweater in family tradition. http://t.co/7FW84ZGTQu pic.twitter.com/MyC4HyKggD\n— ABC News (@ABC) October 8, 2015\nTrending ", "external_links": ["http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/family-keeps-school-picture-tradition-alive", "https://twitter.com/ABC/status/651980014863413248", "http://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=34318338", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/09/1c/bb/sweater2.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-09T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:22:55.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
