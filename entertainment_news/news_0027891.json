They combine their musical expertise with that of the show's usual coaches to determine who stays in the contest, which may mean \"stealing\" hopefuls from another team. \n9 p.m., AMC: Halloween — Jamie Lee Curtis stars in this low-budget but high-quality 1978 horror movie from director John Carpenter. A murderous man returns after 15 years to continue the homicidal rampage he began as a young boy and appears to have some uncanny connection to baby sitter Laurie Strode (Curtis). Donald Pleasence, Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles co-star in what has become a horror classic. \n10:01 p.m., ABC: Castle — In the \"Transporter\" movies, the title character wasn't permanently damaged — but someone else in that line of work isn't so lucky in the new episode \"The Mask.\" The person is killed while trying to get a valuable artwork to its destination, and Castle and Beckett (Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic) have the help of a witness in seeking the painting and solving the murder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:10:06.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
