It was dismissed in August.\nThe girl required assistance by staffers to change her menstrual pad and diaper in February 2013. Two staffers assisted the teen, the lawsuit states.\nA third staff member told the teen that \"she had made a mess in the washroom, that she left tissue paper in and around the toilet, that she left blood in and around the toilet, and that she was required to clean up both,\" the lawsuit alleges.\nThe staffers failed to verify that the blood belonged to the teen and then forced her to mop it up, according to the lawsuit.\nOne staffer, the lawsuit alleges, threatened to \"lock her in the bathroom if she ran over another person's foot with her wheelchair.'\"\nThe initial lawsuit was dismissed in July 2014, according to court records. The family's attorney, Christopher Panio, filed an amended complaint, which was dismissed by Judge Roger Rickmon on Aug. 27, according to county records and a transcript provided by Panio.\nRickmon ultimately sided with the defense's argument that the actions of the three staffers were protected under Illinois' Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, according to court records.\nThe Tort Immunity Act aims to protect local public entities and employees from liability that stems from government operations, according to the General Assembly website.\nTeachers overseeing special-needs programs like the one the girl attended at Bolingbrook High require \"a certain amount of discretion\" to craft goals for those students, defense attorney John O'Driscoll said at the dismissal hearing, according to the transcript.\nO'Driscoll said that, in order to help her learn \"life skills,\" the girl's teachers \"made a decision that in that particular setting she was going to learn how to clean up some blood that was on the floor of the bathroom.\"\nHe also said the allegations of staffers threatening the girl with confinement fall within the discretion of their job duties.\n\"When you're in a special education classroom and there is a student in a wheelchair, if a teacher tells a student I'm going to confine you if you hit another student, if you strike another student, I know it sounds wild to us, but within the special education classroom that's within the discretion of the teacher,\" he said in the transcript.\nPanio said that the rationale for the dismissal \"smacks in the face of common sense.\"\n\"Threatening a child with confinement is not appropriate in any scenario,\" Panio said this week.\nSince there was no formal rule in place banning the defendants from forcing the girl to clean up blood or threatening to lock her in a room, the staffers have discretion as to how they handle such matters, and such discretion is protected under the immunity act, Panio said.\nOfficials with Valley View did not return requests for comment.\ngeoffz@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @JournoGeoffZ\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560defce/turbine/ct-bol-valley-view-lawsuit-dismissed-tl-1001-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:00:53.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
