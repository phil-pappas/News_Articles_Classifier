A year later, Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death.\nIran has also offered over $3 million in reward for anyone who kills Rushdie.\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:50:29.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
