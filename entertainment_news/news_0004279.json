Maybe that sparked the interest.\"\nLikewise for Nakata, the western horrors that stood out for him as a kid growing up were those that terrified viewers without resorting to stomach-churning gore. \n\"I went to school in the 1970s and films like \"The Exorcist,\" \"The Omen\" and \"Suspiria\" were must-see movies,\" he said. \n\"But I didn't enjoy films like the \"Evil Dead\" as much, with all its grotesque cruelty,\" he added, referring to Sam Raimi's supernatural cult favourite.\n\"It just feels too fake if there is too much blood,\" Nakata added. \n\"In 'Ring' I tried to keep the blood to a minimum -- I think there was just a bit of congealed blood around the fingernails, that was it.\"\nNakata believes the creepy ghosts made famous by himself and contemporaries such as \"Juon\" (\"Grudge\") director Takashi Shimizu should elicit sympathy as well as terror.\n\"There is always a battle between good and evil and Christian morals at the heart of scary films made in the West,\" he said. \n\"Japanese ghosts like Sadako are demons, yes, but when she was alive she was treated abominably and suffered terrible abuse before she died. \n\"She now possesses the power to curse or kill people, but she's not pure evil. There's room, on an emotional level, to feel sorry for her.\"\nNakata insisted that his future remains in horror, despite a desire to cast off the shackles and make a romantic comedy.\n\"The late Wes Craven once told me: don't do more than two horror movies,\" he said. \"But I guess it's my destiny. \n\"I want to do something like 'The Intern' (starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway),\" he laughed. \n\"But horror is an indestructible genre and as long as there are people out there who want to be scared to death, I'll keep striving for new ways to scare them.\"\nArts & Entertainment Media Hideo Nakata", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:04:42.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
