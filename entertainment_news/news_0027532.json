Emmy Award Winner and four time Golden Globe Nominee, Armand Assante (HBO’s Gotti, American Gangster, The Mambo Kings) will be in attendance. Expected attendees walking the carpet are Jeff Mauro (Food Network), Ryan Chiaverini (Windy City Live), Jim Peterik (songwriter, Eye Of The Tiger,) and more.\nIn Between Engagements is Woody Allen meets The Hangover, mixing sharp observational comedy with oddball off-the-wall antics. The film follows the trials of four couples, each at a crossroads in their relationship, as they wrestle with insecurities, disenchantment, sibling-rivalry, and that dreaded \"next step\" - the plunge! One proposal shocks the group of friends and wreaks havoc on the once happy couples - straining friendships, ravaging relationships, and destroying Granddaddy’s good china. Add to the mix prostitutes, horse tranquilizers, and a trouble-making eccentric uncle and you’ve got the perfect recipe for hilarity.\n“The filmmaking team is comprised of an extremely talented group of Chicagoans who have worked in various areas of media and entertainment,” said producer Johnny Arreola, VISION Studios.\nWritten and directed by Dominik Sedlar, In Between Engagements brings together up-and-coming talent straight out of the Chicago theater scene. The Second City Mainstage, FOX Television’s hit show Glee, and HBO’s The Brink are just some of the places you’ll see members of this talented young cast.\nThe event is open to the public and will take place Tuesday, September 29th with a pre-screening reception at 6:30pm. Tickets are $12 and include a complementary drink at the reception, a screening of the film, and a Q & A with Assante, writer/director Sedlar, producers, and cast. After-Party is VIP Only and will be held at Tunnel Chicago on Kinzie.\nTo secure your tickets or more information visit: http://www.InBetweenEngagements.com/premiere\nMedia Contact:\nJohnny Arreola (producer)\njohnny@visionstudios.tv", "external_links": ["http://www.InBetweenEngagements.com/premiere"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:23:45.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
