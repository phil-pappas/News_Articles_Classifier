That's what happened at the Webster Bank Arena on Saturday. This little second-period skirmish woke up the Sound Tigers who scored five unanswered goals in the third period to crush the IceCaps. Bob Phillips The Bridgeport Sound Tigers erupted for five unanswered third-period goals, breaking open a tight game and cruising to a 6-1 victory over the St. John’s IceCaps—the top minor league affiliate of the Montreal Canadiens—before 2,108 fans at the Webster Bank Arena on Sunday. Bridgeport improves to 2-0-0-0 for the young season, while St. John’s dropped to 1-1-0-0 .\nThe Sound Tigers opened the scoring at the 6:46 mark of the first period when Mike Halmo redirected a shot taken by teammate Alan Quine past St. John’s goalie Dustin Tokarski. Quine and Kirill Petrov were credited with assists on Halmo’s first goal of the young season. It was also the first point scored in North America by Petrov, a native Russian. Petrov has played on the Russian national team, and professionally in the KHL, the premiere league in Europe.\nThe second period will best be remembered by a wild fracas between the two teams. Have you ever heard the saying, “I went to a fight last night and a hockey game broke out”? Well, that was the second period.\nThe Johnny’s were given a golden opportunity to knot the score in the middle frame when the Sound Tigers were called for covering the puck in the crease, and the IceCaps were awarded a penalty shot at 7:25 for Bridgeport’s faux pas. St. John’s center Charles Hudon made a b-line for the Bridgeport goal, and fired a wrister from right in front of the crease. But the puck clanked off the crossbar and caromed harmlessly back, nullifying the ‘gimme.’\nThen, a short time later, St. John’s center Jeremy Gregiore fell on Sound Tigers’ goalie Stephon Williams in the Bridgeport crease at the 14:11 mark, an action several of the Bridgeport players took umbrage. And so, following the ensuing faceoff on the right of Williams, Bridgeport’s Bracken Kearns started wailing on St. John’s center Angelo Miceli. All 10 players came together and when the IceCaps’ Connor Crisp jumped into the fracas to defend Miceli he was given a game misconduct for being the third man in. Kearns was given a total of 17 minutes in penalties, but he would later be heard once more.\nThe IceCaps knotted the score about five minutes later when rookie center Angelo Micelli picked up his first professional goal at the 12:44 mark to make it 1-1. Brett Lernout and Mac Bennett picked up helpers, as teams skated into the locker room tied at second intermission. But as soon as they returned for third period action, Bridgeport took control of the contest.\nEarly in the period, Taylor Beck spun around and delivered a gorgeous pass to Joe Whitney who buried it in the St. John’s net, giving Bridgeport a 2-1 lead 2:21 into the third stanza—a lead the Tigers would not relinquish for the remainder of the contest. Four and a half minutes later, Kearns (remember him?) banged home a second (or third; who’s counting) rebound past Tokarski at the 6:57 mark, and the rout was on.\n“That's sometimes the way it goes,” said Kearns. “If you maybe get into some kind of heated moment, it fires you up.”\nNext it was Beck’s turn when he went top shelf on Tokarski to finish a breakaway with 9:58 remaining in regulation. Bridgeport made it 5-1 less than a minute later when Jared Gomes deflected a shot by Holmstrom past Tokarski at the 10:47 mark. The Sound Tigers concluded their third-period barrage when James Wright beat Tokarski’s blocker to up the Bridgeport lead to 6-1 with 7:32 left in the game.\nWilliams stopped 33 of the 34 shots he faced in the Bridgeport net, while Tokarski made 23 saves between the St. John’s pipes. Neither team could convert a power play, with the Sound Tigers going 0-for-5 and the Johnnies 0-for-4 with the man advantage.\nNext up for the Sound Tigers will be a rare Tuesday evening match-up against the Springfield Falcons at the Webster Bank Arena. First puck drops at 7 p.m. Tickets are available at the Webster Bank Arena box office or at Tickemaster.", "external_links": ["http://theahl.com/stats/statdisplay.php?type=standings"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:17.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
