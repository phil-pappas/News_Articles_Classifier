Crimes against Muslims and Dalits are increasing in Rajasthan,” JEIH State President Khurshid Hussain said in a statement after holding a state-level meeting here.

JEIH also voiced concern over similar incidents involving minorities and Dalits in other parts of the country, Hussain said. Over the state government’s decision to reform school syllabus, Hussain said the BJP regime is “afraid and trying to communalise the education system”. They are also “harming” the secular fabric of the state, he said. Warning that the public will not accept any syllabus which is imposed on them, Hussain said JEIH demands a draft of proposed syllabus be produced for open discussion before its implementation. \nModified Date: October 26, 2015 5:18 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:18:13.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
