Edsel told The Dallas Morning News (http://bit.ly/1RnyDJ5 ) that the Monuments Men Foundation will stop operating at the end of October. \nEdsel, who made his money in oil and gas, helped establish the art preservation foundation that drew attention following his 2009 book and the movie starring George Clooney. \nEdsel says documenting and sharing the group’s stories cost more than $7 million. The foundation raised half. Edsel paid the rest. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:20:23.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
