The menacing laugh that follows his warning and echoes down the hall confirms that, for you, there's no turning back. \nThe same could be said for Warehouse31's owner Jason Sills, who got involved in the scaring business in St. Augustine, Fla., in 2009 before opening the warehouse in Pelham in 2013. Sills said he decided to make a living by entertaining, and frightening, thousands of people each October after getting a glimpse into the inner workings of the haunted house industry. \n\"When I met somebody that had been involved in the industry, I was blown away by how far the technology had come,\" said Sills. \"The experience that customers have going through it, hearing them laugh, cry or just joke when they come out, it's very entertaining. And it just kind of stuck after that. It just seemed like a fun business to be a part of.\" \nWarehouse31 is made up of more than 30 different settings, including a graveyard, swamp, torture chamber, junkyard and more, that make up 38,000 square feet of fear-inducing scenes. The site also offers visitors the chance to play disturbing carnival games or watch classic horror flicks on the big screen while waiting to meet their doom. \nWhile the attraction features all the classic elements of a traditional haunted house, the warehouse also encompasses a disturbing back story about a young girl who was accidentally killed by her father in a lumber yard nearby in 1875. Wrecked with grief, the man hung himself where Warehouse31 now stands. However, his death wasn't the end of his misery as he is now rumored to haunt the grounds. \nIn addition to vindictive ghosts, patrons of Warehouse31 can expect to face creatures and scenes that engage all the senses and tap into various types of fears and phobias. With more than 60 live actors, adorned in elaborate costumes and make-up, lurking the rooms and hallways of the haunted house, few visitors have made it out unfazed. \n\"I don't want to give anything away, but we try to cover everything,\" said Sills. \"People are scared of different things. Whether it's spiders, bugs or being scared of the dark, claustrophobic, people jumping out at you or something going off and startling you, we try to have something to cover everything that we might be able to scare somebody with.\" \nWhile Warehouse31 is a permanent location, Sills and his workers spend months prior to the scaring season preparing the site by adding new elements, redesigning scenes and tweaking details to ensure patrons from past years' experience new scares. Sills said he believes a haunted house has to stay fresh and keep things interesting to continue drawing in crowds. \n\"I'll say this about our haunted house and the entertainment experience,\" said Sills. \"It's my belief that a house has to encompass a bunch of different things. We rely on great set design so it looks realistic. We have to have great lighting because it really needs to look right. \nThen, we have the audio that goes through there that has to be just right for every scene. Our actors have to fit. We incorporate smells into different scenes just to draw you in. It really takes all of that together. You have to hit it on all cylinders.\" \nWarehouse31 will be open Friday, Saturday and Sunday this weekend. In upcoming weeks, it will extend its hours before remaining open for all of Halloween week. Ticket prices range from $50 to $20.
