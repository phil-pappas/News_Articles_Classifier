Dunphy Launches Website DwDunphy.net\nWebsite coincides with rollout of new album Test Test Test.\nRed Bank, NJ, September 06, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Coming off a summer of peak interest and growth, receiving applause from venues such as Noisetrade's email blog and the ProgArchives website, and seeing unprecedented traffic on Bandcamp for the latest album Test Test Test, New Jersey musician Dw. Dunphy announces the launch of the website www.dwdunphy.net\nThe new site will be a hub that contains all the information and links from other sources and venues, and will also feature exclusive content. Dunphy said he hopes the site will expand his music's reach and influence.\n\"I had a website previous to this, and it was expertly designed by webmaster Jesse Taylor, but I did not have the infrastructure in place to maximize it,\" Dunphy said. \"With so much attention being gained by Test Test Test, the decision to relaunch became a necessity.\"\nTest Test Test, a collection of rock, pop, and orchestral instrumentals continues a series of albums Dunphy refers to as, \"...soundtracks for non-existent movies. This one probably has its head more in the 1980s than previous albums, and unlike Symphonica Transistori or People Wearing Masks, Test Test Test is very song-driven.\"\nWhen asked why the interest has been so high for Test Test Test, Dunphy speculated, \"We might be seeing a new phase in popular music where we're moving back to interest in instrumentals. Remember that, at one time right up until the mid-1980s, it wasn't a surprise to see an instrumental on the pop charts. 'Axel F' from Beverly Hills Cop, 'Miami Vice Theme' by Jan Hammer -- instrumentals were a part of the landscape for decades. Their absence is relatively new.\"\nAdding to this new interest in wordless songs is the rise of the mixtape in hip hop culture, and the increasing need from rappers for unique beats to work with. While Dunphy believes his compositions probably are not best suited for those purposes, he believes that the resurgence of instrumentals has benefited greatly from the movement.\nwww.DwDunphy.net is now live. The Introverse Media release Test Test Test is available from Bandcamp as a free download at: www.dwdunphy.bandcamp.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:59:27.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
