He credits Hollywood’s push of all types of comic stories, as well as publishers’ desire to attract a more diverse fan base.\nBuy Photo Camden Thornton of Macedon shops at Two Kings comic shop in Victor on Oct. 16, 2015.

(Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/@laurenpetracca/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nHis events sometimes draw such large crowds that DeMeyers has to turn people away, but that’s the kind of community he’s hoping for in the store, he said.\n“Two Kings is really unique, because there’s so much space in here not dedicated to selling things,” said Fafinski, noting the seating areas inside the shop for people to hang out during events.\nWatching customers run into each other at the store and recognize each other from work or the gym is a regular occurrence, said Battaglia — “They’ll look at each other and say, ‘you collect comics?’” he said. “It’s kind of a nice social thing.”\nDeMeyers’ regular customers have become close friends, and often help him sort through inventory, he said. In fact, the camaraderie around comics is almost better than the products themselves.\n“We’ve got moms, dads, girls, boys…everyone’s trying it,” he said. “To enjoy this stuff, you have to be able to talk to other people about it.”\nSTADDEO@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7c866b662bebf1efe4447b572ca408abb4efcc0/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806054732631523-LP-two-kings-comics-C-101615-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806054692383265-LP-two-kings-comics-B-101615-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806054692383265-LP-two-kings-comics-B-101615-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35555a421d37d20cf389ad7a0bf5fc8b1e02db42/c=155-0-2815-2000&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806054692383265-LP-two-kings-comics-B-101615-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806054732631523-LP-two-kings-comics-C-101615-Metro.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806054732631523-LP-two-kings-comics-C-101615-Metro.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:51:32.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
