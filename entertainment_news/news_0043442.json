A tech snafu this month left about 300 taxis on the curb when their credit card pay system went down, the company behind the devices said Wednesday.\nThere was a 12-hour outage on the payment processing system from Verifone on the evening of Oct. 5, forcing cab drivers to lose out on prime time business.\nOne fleet owner in Queens whose garage has 350 cars said he had to sideline his drivers in order to get the taxi equipment checked out. The “disgruntled” hacks asked to be paid for the lost time on the road, said the fleet owner, who asked to be anonymous to protect his business relationship with Verifone.\n“Drivers were afraid to take a car out,” he said. “We had almost half of our fleet down that day.”\nMEYER: HOW UBER IS SERVING LOW-INCOME NEW YORKERS\nJason Gross, the taxi systems marketing chief for Verifone, said the problem was “limited in scope” and that drivers were still be able to take up to five credit card transactions at the time.\nMichael Nagle/Getty Images The Taxi and Limousine Commission has approved a pilot program to upgrade fare and payment equipment with modern GPS technology. He blamed the problem on Verifone’s cellular network provider, Sprint.\n“The technology performed perfectly, it did exactly what it was supposed to do,” Gross said. “Unfortunately the cellular network provider had a problem.”\nThe outage hit drivers a week before the Taxi and Limousine Commission approved a pilot to upgrade fare and payment equipment with modern GPS technology .\nTLC spokesman Allan Fromberg said rules for the existing fare payment system, which includes the hated backseat taxi TVs, keeps companies like Verifone from innovating.\n“(The pilot will) allow for both existing vendors and other tech companies to propose more up-to-date and innovative solutions that would offer passengers an even better taxi experience,” he said.\nRelated Stories NYC taxis could get virtual meters, ditch TVs NYC taxi TVs are no more; pilot GPS payment system approved Arro app lets riders order cabs remotely, new rival to Uber", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:26:23.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
