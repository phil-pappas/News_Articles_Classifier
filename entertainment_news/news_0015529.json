Inner strength is just as important as outer strength. Four female writers share where they gain their inner strength.\nA “strong” woman doesn't necessarily mean a physically fit woman. Strength can come in a variety of forms — and emotional and mental strength often come with experiences and life challenges.\nFour women share the keys to their inner strength and how they have gained it through years of experience.\nStaying true to core values\nUtah speaker, author and KSL television personality Connie Sokol says staying true to herself has given her strength in times where she has had big decisions to make.\nSokol, author of \"Faithful, Fit and Fabulous\" and \" Motherhood Matters ,\" says years ago, she was asked by a media network to host a radio show full-time. She says it would have been an incredible opportunity but it didn’t fit with her time with family and other responsibilities with her faith, as well as her efforts to help and serve others.\nShe came up with a plan that would better fit with her values.\n“Instead, I offered a solution: host the show twice a week for only a few hours at a time. That way I could stay true to myself and values and yet still serve in that unique experience,” she said.\nThe radio executives agreed to her plan and even allowed two other part-time hosts, who were also busy mothers, to fill the radio block.\nSokol says staying true to herself has been a way she stays strong through tough decisions.\nHaving a sense of adventure\nUtah writer Margot Hovley , author of \" Sudden Darkness \" and \" Glimmering Light ,\" described living her life 10 years ago as being on “autopilot.”\n“I was very busy with seven children. It seemed like I ran from dawn to dusk. People told me, ‘Wow, you’re doing so much — you must be a mighty woman,’ but I didn’t feel that way. I felt more like a jack of all trades, master of none. The busyness kept me from examining my life,” she said.\nShe says a diagnosis of a rare and dangerous form of cancer changed everything.\nHovley started examining her life, asking if her life’s purposes had been fulfilled, knowing her life could be cut short.\n“When I looked hard at myself — in many ways for the first time — I realized I lacked the sense of adventure I’d had as a child. I decided that I had to stop waiting for 'someday' to have adventures,” she said.\nHovley recovered from cancer, and she says taking more chances and being adventurous is a symbol of strength for her.\n“It reminds me to not get stuck on autopilot like I used to live and drink life in while I have the chance,” she said.\nKindness\nKaysville author Jennifer Moore , whose books include \" Becoming Lady Lockwood \" and \" Miss Burton Unmasks a Prince ,\" gets her strength from being kind even when being kind is not the ideal or even natural emotion for a situation.\nMoore says several weeks ago she did something kind for a woman she knew. Soon after, she received an email from the woman. Expecting a thank-you note for her thoughtfulness, she got something else.\n“Her letter was insulting and rude and told me I’d done everything all wrong and she wished I hadn’t bothered in the first place,” Moore said.\nMoore says she was shocked and angry by the response.", "external_links": ["http://www.margothovley.com/", "http://shesgotthewritestuff.blogspot.com/", "http://conniesokol.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:15:59.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
