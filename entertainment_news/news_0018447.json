That's what my break was really about,\" she told music magazine Billboard.\n\"I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're assholes,'\" she said of the tabloid press.\n\"But I was angry I even felt the need to say that. It's awful walking into a restaurant and having the whole room look at you, knowing what they're saying.\n\"I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again,\" she said.\nGomez said that she has been helped out in part by her friendship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, who \"makes me feel empowered.\"\nLupus is estimated to strike some five million people around the world, disproportionately women of childbearing age, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.\nWhile Gomez did not go into greater detail about her lupus, the disease is commonly treated with Methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug used at much lower doses to fight inflammation. One potential side effect is hair loss.\nSince the episode, Gomez has returned to an active schedule. Her second solo album, \"Revival,\" comes out on Friday.\nThe celebrity website Popdust had initially reported on Gomez's lupus diagnosis in 2013, at which time the singer's representatives declined comment.\nHealth Arts & Entertainment Selena Gomez chemotherapy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:50:11.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
