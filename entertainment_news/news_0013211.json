(Monty Brinton/CBS) Welcome back to the island, or what passes for an island. Use your imagination, people. And speaking of imagination, Ta Keo tribe members return to camp and Spencer, who is at the very bottom of pecking order, promises his tribe that he will change and be the most wonderful tribemate they've every known. \nThe others don't really care, they're mostly just happy to be rid of Shirin, who was voted off earlier. Terry thinks he's moved from the top to the bottom without doing anything, and that he's playing a good social game. \nThe next morning the tribes meet on a sandy beach. Ta Keo says it is happy without Shirin and Bayon says it's the love tribe. That's good, because Jeff Probst is about to change that. Time for a switcheroo. Host, Jeff Probst, and the two tribes before they are split into three during 'Survivor Cambodia: Second Chance.' televised on Wednesday, October 7, 2015. (Monty Brinton/CBS) \nThe two tribes will become three. \nFour of the original Bayon members -- Jeremy, Kimmi, Monica, and Fish -- remain on Bayon, where they are joined by former Ta Keo members Spencer and Wigglesworth. Ta Keo members Terry and Kelly are joined by Bayon's Joe, Ciera, Keith and Kass. The new tribe, Angkor, has four original Ta Keo members -- Abi, Peih-Gee, Woo and Jeff -- and two Bayons, Andrew and Tasha. \nJoe thinks the new Ta Keo is strong, but happiest of all is Spencer, who sees a new chance on his new tribe. \nBy the way, Bayon and Ta Keo tribes both return to their original camps but Angkor has to go to a new location and start over building their camp. Advertisement \nAt the new camp, Abi, Peih-Gee, Woo and Jeff talk about playing smart and not doing something stupid. Just stick together and vote off Andrew and Tasha, one by one. So of course, you know they are totally going to do something stupid. Meanwhile, Tasha and Andrew discuss strategy in finding weaknesses and exploiting them. \nOver at Ta Keo, everyone is talking happy tribe. Kelly, however, is talking smack against Terry, because if the tribe loses the next immunity challenge, it will be either her or Terry on the chopping block, and she's starting the under-the-bus push early. \nSpencer, who remains on the bottom of his new tribe, is trying to play the social game by telling Jeremy how his girlfriend has told him that she loves him, but he hasn't said it back to her. He wants Jeremy's advice, and Jeremy is happy to serve as a love coach. Jeremy decides he likes Spencer. We didn't realize that being pathetic and romantically challenged equated to playing a good social game, but hey, there's a lot of things of didn't know before our lives were touched by \"Survivor.\" \nLife is sort of miserable on Angkor. They don't have shelter, food or water, and it's pouring rain. Jeff shouts at the sky and Tasha says this is only bringing out her drive to survive. While huddled together, Tasha notices that Abi and Peih-Gee have a conflict going on and she wants to take advantage of it. She offers friendship to Abi and a promise that when the tribes come back together, Abi can join with them. Abi is tempted and now confused about her loyalties. \nTasha and Andrew offer a deal to Jeff, who feigns interest. He later tells the camera that Andrew and Tasha are on the bottom, and his alliance can pick them off any time they want. But he's worried about Abi and Peih-Gee and wants to make sure they stay with the plan, which is to ride to the final on the backs of their enemies. \nOn Bayon, Fish is happy to be in the majority, but he's worried about the hidden immunity idol out there somewhere and thinks it would be great if his group could find it \"for the alliance.\" Oh yeah, that's how it works. They all are searching for it and even though Jeremy says he is sick of looking for the idol, he ends up finding the clue that tells him where the hidden idol is stashed at the next immunity challenge. He doesn't know how he's going to grab it in front of everyone, but he's going to try. Immunity challenge Cue the dramatic music, it's time for the challenge. Each tribe must push a cart through an obstacle course, grab a key off a tower, use the key to unchain a chest, load the chest on the cart and move to the next tower. Once all three chests have been collected, they must take the cart apart and move it, the chests and the tribe members through a gate, then reassemble it and get the cart and trunks through another obstacle course. Once they've made it, two tribe members must use the pieces in the chests to solve a puzzle. \nAmazingly, in the midst of the challenge drama, Jeremy manages to grab the idol and shove it in his shorts' pocket without anyone noticing. \nThanks to Kass and Joe, Ta Keo powers through the puzzle to come in first. Bayon manages to complete its puzzle next and just like that, Angkor is headed to tribal council. \nAfter losing, Jeff tries to communicate with Wigglesworth on the Bayon tribe, and Tasha jumps between them, shouting \"We've got a rat,\" which must have brought up bad memories for Wigglesworth, who was famously compared to a rat in her first \"Survivor\" game. \nWhen Probst questions them about what was going on, Jeff spills the beans that Andrew and Tasha had made a deal with him; Woo then gets upset, asking Jeff if they were still in an alliance and wondering why Jeff hadn't made a deal with him. \nJeff later tells the camera that he shouldn't have done it and now he's in a big mess. Andrew, however is happy at what Jeff did, pointing out to Peih-Gee and Woo that Jeff is unreliable, not doing his part around camp, and is just a good person to vote off. \nTasha prepares to convince Abi, but Abi actually approaches Tasha with the idea of voting off Jeff. She goes to Peih-Gee and Woo and asks what they are going to do. When they say they're thinking about voting off Jeff, Abi tells them they need to decide now. She knows what she's doing and that's voting with Tasha and Andrew. \nThat upsets Peih-Gee, who then goes to Tasha and Andrew and says she wants to vote off Abi. Then Abi goes to them and says she want to vote off Peih-Gee. \nJeff is happy because that means he won't be going home. Tribal council Probst questions the tribe about the switch. Andrew says it was too much to process with having to start over, but he eventually realized that he was in the minority. Probst asks about the immunity challenge. Jeff says he was trying to send a message to another person that he cares about, but he doesn't actually remember what happened. He was having an emotional meltdown. Tasha recalls, though. \nJeff also says even though he's heard people talking about voting him off, he just might escape without anyone writing his name down even once. Andrew and Tasha are in charge of tonight's vote, he says, and they have gone from the bottom to the top. He also spills that the person going home will likely be Peih-Gee or Abi; neither express surprise about this. \nVotes are cast and collected; no hidden immunity idols are played; and the votes go against Peih-Gee, 4-2. As usual, Woo appears confused. Peih-Gee wishes him good luck, while Abi laughs, rather threateningly we thought, and tells Woo that's the second time he's written down her name. We think Woo should be sleeping with one eye open from here on out. Next time: Angkor is in hell, and an immunity challenge goes wrong, #callthemedics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:29:35.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
