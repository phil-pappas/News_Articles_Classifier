Rita Ora and her Girls: Havva Rebke, Lauren Murray, Kiera Weathers, Monica Michael, Louisa Johnson and Chloe Paige (Thames/Syco) \n“We love Rita. She definitely wants to win this year and I definitely think the winner is in the Girls category,” Lauren said. \n“It’s so hard (to predict) because everyone is so good this year. The groups are coming in strong with Bekln, the gospel choir who are just wicked. The Girls are coming in and killing it. We don’t know (who will triumph).” BUT CONGRATS TO ALL MY GIRLS! 💘 Lauren, Monica, Keira, Havva, Louisa & Chloe. 💘 what do you all think of #teamora ? Promoted stories \n— Rita Ora (@RitaOra) October 4, 2015 \nLauren admitted the Six Chair Challenge – which saw her taking a seat from Lucy Duffield, who in turn took Sharon Rose’s place – was “crazy”. Rita was faced with boos from the audience when she swapped Karen Mav’s seat for Kiera. \n“Six Chairs was mental. I think it was one of the worst experiences of my life 100%,” she said. \n“I never want to see six white chairs again, ever in my life. I was just thinking, ‘How am I going to top this?’ and (after) every girl who went on, it got worse and worse.” Never in my life want to see this EVER AGAIN 😷😷😷😷😩😩😩😂😂😂🎉 pic.twitter.com/NLm1StFThO \n— Lauren Murray (@LaurenMurray89) October 5, 2015 \nLauren, who counts former X Factor winner Leona Lewis and the late Whitney Houston as her inspirations, revealed she has given up her job as a dental receptionist while she awaits her future in the singing competition. \n“I don’t work in the dentist any more because it was getting too disruptive. I’m not doing that for a little bit until we find out what’s going on,” she explained. \nThe aspiring singer also stood up for Simon, who expressed his fury after being told he would be mentoring the Overs. He has since apologised for his outburst, tweeting: “I did apologise to my contestants.” Yes I did apologise to my contestants. \n— Simon Cowell (@SimonCowell) October 4, 2015 \nLauren said: “You know, Simon’s actually not as bad as he makes out to be. On camera, he’s worse than what he is in real life. \n“So far, I’ve had really nice comments from him. I really like him. I’m just happy that he knows who I am. He’s heard me singing – that’s one of my dreams. That was definitely on my bucket list, for Simon to just recognise me and to hear me sing, so I’m so happy to get this far.” Share article \nThe X Factor continues on Sunday (October 11) at 7pm on ITV.
