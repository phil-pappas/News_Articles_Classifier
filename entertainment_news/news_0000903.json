Odom, 35, had fallen unconscious last week while staying at a legal Nevada brothel, where he had used cocaine and sexual-performance enhancers, according to the Nye County Sheriff's Office. He was comatose for four days in a Las Vegas hospital before awakening and being transferred to California via medical helicopter. \nOdom and Kardashian were married on Sept. 27, 2009, in a lavish Beverly Hills ceremony. But the Queens native and two-time NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers has had a troubled history with drug abuse, and was sentenced to 36 months probation on Dec. 9, 2013, after pleading no contest to an August DUI charge. Reports at the time said he and Kardashian had mostly lived apart since that summer while attending couples counseling, and did not spend their fourth anniversary together in September.
