Van Brunt St., Englewood. 201-816-8168; bergenpac.org.\nHOW MUCH: $39 to $69.\nIt’s a little after 11 p.m. in England and David Sedaris is chatting on the phone with a reporter from New Jersey — pacing back and forth as he speaks, he notes.\n\"Today, I have walked, let’s see — I have a device that tells me how much I’ve walked — so, today I’ve walked 18.8 miles,\" Sedaris says. \"Yesterday I walked 21 miles and the day before that I walked 22 miles and I’m pacing around right now on the phone, ’cause I’m determined to get to 19 miles.\"\nThe North Carolina-bred comedian and humor writer, now 58, must be in terrific shape. But that’s not why Sedaris — who’s slated to perform at bergenPAC in Englewood Saturday — patrols the streets and parks of the West Sussex town he most often calls home. He wants to beautify his surroundings and, grabber in hand, to root out rubbish.\nIs there really that much of it?\n\"Yeah, it’s really discouraging,\" Sedaris says. \"When we moved here, I just thought, what the hell is going on? Where did all this rubbish coming from? And everybody said, ‘What are you talking about?’ … I think people here have just gotten so used to it… . The route that I walked today, I did that same route the day before yesterday and I still filled a big, like, Hefty bag full of rubbish.\"\n\"I try not to get angry about it,\" Sedaris says of his voluntary \"litter patrol,\" noting that some people do thank him for his effort or give him a thumbs up sign. \"I listen to podcasts and audio books. I’m just kind of in my own little world.\" \nSome of the things he listens to have tidbits that he jots down. His unique and hilarious observations have wound up in a number of memorable New Yorker essays, public-radio pieces and in his books. Five of his essay collections — \"Naked\" (1997), \"Holidays on Ice\" (1997), \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" (2000), \"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\" (2004), and \"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\" (2008) — became New York Times bestsellers.\nDuring tonight’s \"An Evening with David Sedaris,\" he plans to read out loud for an hour — some \"new things\" he’s been working on — then answer questions for about another half an hour.\n\"I’ve been keeping a diary for 40 years. Whenever I do a reading like this in the evening I always read out loud from my diary, not higgledy-piggledy, but there’s things that I say, ‘Oh, I bet this will work’ and I have set them aside and put them in a certain order. I’ve just been doing that forever,\" he says. \"And so, I thought I’m gonna put out a book of them, it’s like things from my diary that I think are funny or interesting.\"\nA conversation with Sedaris is easy and fun and unpredictable. It might touch on a \"horrifying\" article someone had sent him that day (\"these two horrible women have come up with a Yelp [to rate] people\") or a heartwarming quote he heard in a podcast interview with a former \"Saturday Night Live\" writer named Paula Pell.\n\"She was talking about how funny her father was. And she said ‘We had so much laughter in our house.’ And I wrote that down, because I thought, what a great thing to say. I mean, I feel like I could say the exact same thing and I have often, but it was just kind of the way she said it. It was just so beautiful and I thought, it doesn’t really get any better than that, does it?\"\nOr, the subject might turn to the four homes that he and his longtime boyfriend (his choice of words) Hugh Hamrick have between them. In addition to the main home base, the house in West Sussex, which the couple purchased about five years ago, Sedaris still has an apartment in Paris, because, he says, \"my dentist is there and I can’t possibly change dentists.\" \nThe couple also have a house in Normandy, which they now rent out, and a house in London, currently occupied by a Greek woman whose life has been upended by the country’s financial crisis and austerity measures.\n\"This woman had her own radio program and was on television and now she’s working in a gift shop in a tomato-paste museum. So, we just got to talking and I said, ‘Would you travel for work?’ And she said, ‘I would love to leave Greece …’ \" says Sedaris, whose father was of Greek descent. \"And so, she’s living in our house in London. She’s gonna try to find a job.\"\nSedaris’ most recent New Yorker essay, titled, \"A Modest Proposal\" (in the Sept. 28 issue), was about how he and Hamrick never had a desire to get married, but how Sedaris’ accountant said that \"for tax purposes\" (especially inheritance tax purposes), they really needed to do so. And Sedaris began an unsuccessful campaign to get Hamrick to change his mind. \nHas there been any progress on that front? \"No,\" Sedaris says. \"The article coming out only seems to have kind of cemented his refusal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:33:20.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
