The online marketplace is suing people who had been offering on Fiverr.com, a website that... on.aol.com Amazon fake reviewers are misleading Amazon customers with paid five-star reviews, and since the practice is deceiving online shoppers and hurting Amazon’s reputation and credibility, the company is on the war path against more than 1,000 fake reviewers. The lawsuit against the false reviewers was filed last Friday in Seattle, Washington.\nAs reported by CNN Money on October 18, the fake reviewers are being called “John Doe” in Amazon’s lawsuit since the online company does not know the full names of the defendants. What the online company does know is that the 1,114 reviewers are account holders on Fiverr.com, a marketplace that offers odd-jobs where \"gigs\" are sold for $5 and up. Fiverr.com is not mentioned in the lawsuit and is cooperating with Amazon.\nAs mentioned in Amazon’s lawsuit , the reviewers’ practice of providing false five-star ratings is hurting Amazon’s image as a trustworthy seller: \"While small in number, these reviews can significantly undermine the trust that consumers and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, which in turn tarnishes Amazon's brand.”\nAmazon’s investigation into the false reviewers included pretending to be a seller and purchasing fake customer reviews on Fiverr from people who promised five-star ratings for a product in lieu of payment of as little as $5. The fact that those reviewers tried to avoid detection by using multiple accounts with different unique IP addresses indicates that the reviewers were aware of breaking Amazon’s policy against paid-for or fictional reviews.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34565631"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:23:32.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
