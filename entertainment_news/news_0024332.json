Mississippi family trying to save Florence Ghostbusters' iconic Ecto-1", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Comments \nThe family of an Iuka, Miss., boy who turned seven this month is trying to raise $20,000 to save the Florence Ghostbusters' iconic Ecto-1 that was totaled while traveling Saturday. \nKelly Lee Johnson and her husband, Jamie, opened a GoFundMe account this week to support Brandon Balentine , a \"Ghostsbusters\" fanatic and owner/operator of the fan club Florence Ghostbusters. Balentine's 1967 Pontiac Bonneville, which was renovated to look like the Ecto-1, was damaged beyond repair over the weekend. \nThe Ecto-1, which made public appearances at parties, parades, conventions and other events, was on its way back to northwest Alabama from a birthday party for Johnson's son when the accident happened. \n\"We were pulling Ecto on a trailer behind my Chevy Avalanche,\" Balentine said. \"We were on our way back when, as we were coming off a hill, the trailer began to fishtail. I applied some gas and used the trailer brakes to straighten it out, just as I had done many other times in the exact same situation. For some reason, it didn't work this time.\" \nHeartbroken \nThe trailer jackknifed, the Avalanche rolled several times, and the Ecto-1 was thrown from the trailer, warping the body. Balentine said he, fellow Florence Ghostbuster, Alex Newborn, and his son, Zak, walked away from the accident unscathed. \nBalentine found out Sunday the vehicle cannot be fixed. He said the group will have to build another car if they want another ghost-busting Ecto-1. \n\"I know that we are all three blessed to be safe after such a serious wreck, but at the same time, I can't help but be heartbroken,\" he said. \nSo far, the fundraising campaign has brought in $260 by 16 donors in two days. Johnson hopes the money will help the Florence Ghostbusters find and renovate a new vehicle for the future. \nShe said her son, who watches \"Ghostbusters\" all the time, was upset when he learned about the wreck following his party at a skating rink. \n\"He said he needed to pray for them that they were OK and that he was going to have the church pray for them,\" she said. \"My son has a big heart. He said we needed to do something to help them make people happy again. That is why it is important for me and my family to try and help them.\" \nThe history \nBalentine acquired the vehicle in 2011 after one of his friends bought the old U.S. Navy ambulance, hoping to make some money off of it. Balentine, who already owned a \"Ghostbusters\" uniform, said the same friend was interested in his 1996 Mustang Cobra. \nThey traded their vehicles straight up and the rest is history. \n\"My thinking was that I can always get another Cobra, but when am I going to get another chance at owning a car that I can turn into the Ecto-1?\" he said. \nIt took eight months to renovate, and all the work was done by Balentine's family members and friends. Balentine said all he \"ever really wanted to do is introduce the 'Ghostbusters' franchise to a new generation of kids and make people smile.\" \n\"It always made me feel good when I would be riding around during the Halloween season and someone at a red light or someone walking their dog would yell, 'Who ya gonna call?'\" he said. \"This year, unfortunately, it won't be us.\" \nReturning the favor \nSince announcing the wreck on Facebook, Balentine said they have received an outpouring of support from fans. Even Balentine's wife, who initially didn't care for the car, said \"it feels like we've lost a dear friend.\" \nJohnson said the Florence Ghostbusters had a big impact on her son's birthday party, so she hopes to return the favor. \n\"If my 7-year-old can be so thoughtful and willing to help someone he doesn't know all because he said they make people smile, then I will do everything in my power to make his wish come true,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:09:31.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
