Both groups have been very busy competing and winning awards, and are planning for an equally busy fall and winter season. For example, the Rochester Rhapsody women's chorus, and the ladies champion quartet Fusion, will soon be traveling to the Harmony Incorporated International competition at the Turning Stone Casino and Resort. My contact Cynthia write that \"with new costumes, a couple of intense coaching weekends and a LOT of new choreography moves under our belt, we are ready to take on the other contestants.\"\nThe chorus will be having a send-off performance at their regular Monday evening rehearsal, at 7 pm at the Harmony House on Main Street in Webster. It's not a concert, but both groups will be reviewing their competition sets. Stop by if you have a minute.\nCynthia was especially excited to tell me about the chorus' annual community Holiday Chorus, which is forming on November 16. Basically, any woman who sings is free to come and sing for the holidays without obligation or audition. Interested participants attend Monday-night rehearsals for three weeks to learn the holiday songs and then will perform three Monday nights at local holiday concerts. It sounds like a great opportunity for any woman loves to sing and has often thought of looking into joining Rochester Rhapsody.\nYou can log onto the Rochester Rhapsody website for more information.\nchorus of the genesee\nThe Chorus of the Genesee has also be very busy of late.\nMy friend Lee Shepter writes,\n\"We competed at our Fall Convention in September at the Rochester Convention Center. We came in second place in the District. Under our new Director, Steve Link, the Chorus scored better than we have scored in my eight years of membership. We lost to a 'select' chorus, one that recruits the best singers from choruses in and out of our District. ... we gave that chorus a serious run, and people are taking note that the Chorus of the Genesee is going to be a force next year.\" The Chorus also recently performed at Rochester's Lyric Theater as part of this year's Fringe Festival and word is they had a terrific time.\nMy friend Lee also just provided some late-breaking news:\n\"If you're bored with football this Sunday, Ra Cha Cha will be performing at an open house to benefit the Ogden Historical Society. We'll be performing at the Pulver House Museum on Colby Road in Ogden. Additionally, we're working on a Veterans Day quartet performance at Klem South Elementary School for the student body.\" So if you're out Ogden way Sunday afternoon, you might want to pop into that show, and if you have students at Klem South, keep an eye out for a possible performance there in November.\nStay tuned here for news of upcoming fundraisers, and of course the chorus' annual caroling event as the holidays near.\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8745ae0cbd85e9edf7e8c3874954ab00fdef4170/r=121x115/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23320-chorus-of-the-genesee.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/135da87c7c6e2619ef65eb6cb84029bd458d1d50/c=0-12-121-103&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23320-chorus-of-the-genesee.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23320-chorus-of-the-genesee.jpg", "http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "http://www.chorusofthegenesee.org/index.html", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog", "http://www.rochesterrhapsody.com/index2.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:06:28.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
