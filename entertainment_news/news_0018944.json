The uncovered treasure trove eventually revealed canvases by Picasso, Chagall and Matisse. Valued at more than $1.35 billion, the apparent Nazi heist made headlines worldwide.\nTurns out that this was the collection Gurlitt inherited from his father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, who once had been the “official art dealer” of the Third Reich. Before and during World War II, Hildebrand boldly stole enough fine art from Europe’s museums, galleries, and Jewish family estates to fill Nazi warehouses — and later secret bank vaults.\nSusan Ronald’s new book, Hitler’s Art Thief: Hildebrand Gurlitt, the Nazis and the Looting of Europe’s Treasures, tells the back story of what may be the most startling art-world bust in modern history.\nThe author of six histories, including Heretic Queen: Queen Elizabeth I and the Wars of Religion , Ronald discloses that, as an investment banker handling business inside a high-security Swiss bank vault in 1998, she initially saw evidence of a secret Gurlitt stash. Soon after, unexpectedly, she inherited two Nazi-looted artworks. And then came the Gurlitt apartment raid. That all sealed the deal for her. While trying to return her inheritance to the rightful owner, she began researching this book.\nBut while this promises to be a fascinating art thievery tale like no other, filled with greed, deception, betrayal, and, of course, Hitler, Ronald writes first and foremost as a historian in the book’s first half, with engaging storytelling only an afterthought. In fact, this book reads like two different books — one you’d suffer through from your college required reading list; the other you’d snatch off a best-seller shelf.\nOnly a history buff could love the first ponderous 100 pages in which Ronald develops an often tedious Gurlitt family history and dabbles at painting a psychological portrait of the mentally unstable young HiIdebrand. She parallels Hildebrand’s formative years with those of the young wanna-be artist and raging misanthrope Adolf Hitler. And she sets all of this within the context of a warmed-over chronology of European history spanning the two World Wars.\nAuthor Susan Ronald. (Photo: Andrew Balerdi, Dandy Photos)\nRonald doesn’t let Hildebrand off the hook as simply an art thief who robbed the world of masterpieces: “He stole the lives of his victims… ” she writes. “Attached to each artwork is at least one human tragedy and death.” But readers who survive the book’s first half will find that Ronald writes with passion instead of pretense thereafter.\nShe describes the intriguing details of how Hildebrand schemed during the war to collect his hoard of art. She tells the captivating story of Hildebrand’s post-war years, surviving with his family off the grid, selling artwork when finances necessitated, hiding museums’ worth of art not only in his apartment, but, she speculates, in still undiscovered locations throughout Europe.\nOne of this story’s ironies is that Hildebrand was one-quarter Jewish — more than enough to assure an invitation to a death camp instead of the Führer’s art collection. Another is that Hildebrand embezzled some of the art even from his boss, Hitler.\nA final irony hardly worth mentioning is the faint speculation that Hildebrand Gurlitt stole art, at least some of the time, for humanity. Like some German Monument Men hero, did he rescue endangered art from the evil Nazis’ aesthetic cleansing?\nThe answer, in the end, was found in that apartment in Munich. Neither he nor his son, Cornelius, now dead, ever gave a brushstroke of the looted art back.\nHitler's Art Thief: Hildebrand Gurlitt, the Nazis, and the Looting of Europe's Treasures\nBy Susan Ronald\nSt. Martin's Press, 400 pp.\n2.5 out of 4 stars\nGoodreads reviews for Hitler's Art Thief: Hildebrand Gurlitt, the Nazis, and the Looting of Europe's Treasures USA Today's Best-Selling Books List", "external_links": ["http://www.zolabooks.com/book/9781250061096?utm_source=usatoday&utm_campaign=usatodaypreview", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33209e9b28ed498595ee4723f7697342fd9797ea/r=180/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798396784991412-Hitler-s-Art-Thief-cover.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Hitler%27s%20Art%20Thief%3A%20Hildebrand%20Gurlitt%2C%20the%20Nazis%2C%20and%20the%20Looting%20of%20Europe%27s%20Treasures", "http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250061096?aff=usatoday", "http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=KvWLOjf5AfM&offerid=280046.15979781476325286&type=2&murl=http://www.kobobooks.com/search/search.html?q=Hitler%27s%20Art%20Thief%3A%20Hildebrand%20Gurlitt%2C%20the%20Nazis%2C%20and%20the%20Looting%20of%20Europe%27s%20Treasures", "http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=KvWLOjf5AfM&subid=&offerid=229293.1&type=10&tmpid=8433&RD_PARM1=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Hitler%27s%20Art%20Thief%3A%20Hildebrand%20Gurlitt%2C%20the%20Nazis%2C%20and%20the%20Looting%20of%20Europe%27s%20Treasures/Susan%20Ronald/e/9781250061096", "http://www.goodreads.com/api/reviews_widget_iframe?did=5005&format=html&header_text=Goodreads+reviews+for+&isbn=9781250061096&links=0AF&review_back=fff&stars=149CEE&stylesheet=http://www.gannett-cdn.com/static/usat-web-static-1592.0/css/bundles/books.min.css?v=1592.0&text=000", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cef6944d4a3b3f3529600f11c4874d0815c62036/c=226-0-1760-2045&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798400473658702-Ronald-Author-Photo-CREDIT-Andrew-Balerdi-Dandy-Photos.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250061091", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id38?mt=11&ls=1&at=11l3Mc", "http://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bquery%5D=9781250061096"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:51:02.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
