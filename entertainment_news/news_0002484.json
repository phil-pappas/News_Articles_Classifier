(Paul Buck/ EPA) Bethonie Butler The Washington Post What we know about Tracy Morgan's hosting stint on \"SNL\" \nTracy Morgan will host \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend, marking a triumphant return for the comedian and \"SNL\" alum, who survived a horrific car crash last year. \nMorgan suffered a traumatic brain injury after a Wal-Mart trailer tractor slammed into his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike in June of 2014. \nIn promo videos for Saturday's episode, Morgan pokes fun at the injury, pretending not to remember his time on \"SNL\" or that Bobby Moynihan and Horatio Sanz are two different people. He also delivers his signature joke: \"I'm gonna get everyone in this building pregnant!\" \nMorgan riffed on that joke in an emotional (and surprise) appearance at the Emmy Awards last month. \"I miss you guys so much,\" he told the audience. \"It's been a long road back.\" \nIndeed, it's been a long recovery for the 46-year-old, also well-known for his self-parodying role as Tracy Jordan on \"30 Rock.\" Months after the accident, there were doubts as to whether the comedian would ever be able to work again. During SNL's 40th anniversary special in February, Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin paid tribute to Morgan, who was noticeably absent. (Tribune wire reports) \nIn June, Morgan appeared on the \"Today\" show in his first interview following the accident. He held onto a cane as he tearfully spoke with Matt Lauer about the extent of his injuries and the loss of his friend, comedy writer James McNair, who was killed in the crash. \n\"I love comedy and I can't wait to get back to her,\" Morgan told Lauer. \"But right now my goal is just to heal and get better. Because I'm not 100 percent yet. I'm not. And when I'm there, you'll know it. I'll get back to making you laugh. I promise you.\" \nThree months later, Morgan's progress was noticeable at the Emmys, where he walked out to a standing ovation and proudly announced: \"I'm here. Standing on my own two feet.\" \"30 Rock\" and \"SNL\" star Tracy Morgan was seriously injured when his limo bus overturned in a multi-vehicle wreck on the New Jersey Turnpike early Saturday morning. \nPhotos from the press room at the Emmys also show the actor goofing around, smiling and exposing his stomach, with his wife Megan Wollover by his side. \nMorgan returned to the stage earlier this week, performing stand-up on Monday at two New York comedy clubs. According to Refinery29, the comedian told the crowd at the Comedy Cellar that he would be hosting \"SNL\" this week and cracked jokes about speech therapy. \nBut \"Saturday Night Live\" will be Morgan's most high-profile performance since his accident. It's unclear what \"SNL\" has planned, though surprise cameos are always a possibility on the comedy show. \nWhatever happens, the return to Studio 8H is sure to be emotional for Morgan, who spent seven seasons on \"SNL\" and returned to host the show in 2009. Morgan impersonated celebrities such as Star Jones and Maya Angelou and coined memorable characters such as enthusiastic non-zoologist Brian Fellow. \nAs part of his 'Today\" show interview in June, Morgan walked slowly through Studio 8H, telling Lauer that the studio felt like home. \n\"I love comedy and I wonder how I'mma be funny again, how I'mma get to it. And the fans have let me know, 'We can't wait for you to come back,' Morgan said, choking up with tears. \"And I can't wait to make them laugh again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:03:33.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
