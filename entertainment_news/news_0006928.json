The festival's website was updated mid-morning with the same message.\nAdvertisement \"It is with a heavy heart and great regret that Soulfest International advises that it has become necessary to cancel Soulfest and the subsequent sideshows, due to poor ticket sales,\" the statement reads.\nOrganisers went on to say that the festival was launched with the intention of promoting genres of music \"often overlooked commercially in this country, specifically Neo-Soul, RnB and Hip-Hop, and SoulFest 2014 successfully delivered some of the most exciting talent within these genres\".\nMiguel was also set to perform at SoulFest 2015. Photo: supplied \nBut despite the stellar line-up for the 2015 event, this year's ticket sales were so bad that \"the financial loss that would would be incurred by the event if it were to go ahead as planned would be devastating\", organisers said.\n\"There have been many people working behind the scenes, including media partners, artists, sponsors, sub-contracted promoters, communication managers, agents and suppliers who live, breathe and support this incredible genre of music and have worked tirelessly to try and make this event a success.\n\"The promoter of SoulFest International Australia, John Denison, sincerely apologizes (sic) to all involved who have dedicated 7 months of their lives to work on this festival, and to the supporters of the event who purchased tickets.\"\nMary J Blige performs at a British music festival in July. Photo: Samir Hussein \nIt's not the first time festival promoter John Denison has disappointed artists and fans - local acts booked for the Melbourne leg of the 2014 SoulFest were angered by a last minute decision to cancel the event's \"local stage\".\n\"Due to a combination of operational and logistical issues - the local stage will not be operating today. All local artists will not be appearing. We apologize (sic)  to our local artists and the punters for this inconvenience,\" a Facebook post at the time read.\nBut that was small-fry compared to the promoter's previous festival, Supafest. In April 2012, Denison and his then business partner Dwayne Cross pulled three advertised headline acts from the line-up of Supafest , billed as \"Australia's largest hip-hop festival\", which they first staged in 2010.\nAt the time, Supafest organisers released a statement saying P Diddy and Missy Elliott's performances were cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\nBut Missy Elliott claimed she was falsely advertised as a headliner, having not signed a contract, while P Diddy (also known as Sean Combes) took to Twitter to say he was \"mad as f--k\" at what he described as a breach of contract by Supafest organisers.\n\"The promoters never sent the money for the show i love you guys!\" he tweeted to his five million followers.\n\"@SupaFest2012 stop playing around and come thru with what you agreed to in the contract!!! Don't cheat the people givem what dey want,\" he tweeted.\nThe festival went ahead - Chris Brown, Ice Cube and Kelly Rowland were among the acts who played - but ticket sales were, as one might expect, lower than Mr Denison might have liked.\nShortly afterwards, in May 2012, Paper Chase Touring and Entertainment, the major partner in Supafest, was being chased by several creditors, including the The Phonographic Performance Company of Australia , which collects royalties for artists, who were seeking $13,200 in unpaid fees.\nThen in October, Mr Denison was sued by A-League soccer club Melbourne Victory for unpaid fees for a soccer friendly against Greek team Olympiakos.\nAccording to documents lodged in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Mr Denison had \"agreed to pay Melbourne Victory the sum of $110,000 on or before 31 July 2012\".\nIn February 2013, Supafest collapsed and administrators were appointed to Supafest and Paperchase Touring and Entertainment, with the company owing debts in excess of $2 million.\nThe SoulFest website states that \"no further statement or comments will be issued\".\nLast year's inaugural SoulFest, which featured D'Angelo, Common, Aloe Blacc, Leela James and Angie Stone among its diverse line-up was well received by fans and critics.\nWhile angry Australian and New Zealand fans have taken to Twitter to vent their disappointment, so far none of the artists scheduled to play have posted any reactions on social media.\nTicket holders will be offered full refunds; for details check soulfest.com.au\nSOULFEST 2015 CANCELLEDIt is with a heavy heart and great regret that Soulfest International advises that it has...\nPosted by Soulfest on Tuesday, 13 October 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:00:28.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
