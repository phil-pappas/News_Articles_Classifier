Does he have 100% mental capacity?' But the truth is I never did,\" Morgan said to big laughs opening the show. \"I might actually be a few points higher now.\" Quick Clicks Pro-refugee candidate stabbed in Germany \nMorgan thanked his \"comedy family\" including \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels who Morgan called his \"Obi-Wan Kenobi.\" \nMorgan was greeted by his former \"30 Rock\" co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer who pretended to be a part of a scene from a 2012 episode of the former award-winning comedy. \n\"I just want to say one last thing, Tracy, from the heart and this part is no joke. We're so happy that you're OK and we're happier that you're ready to make people laugh again,\" Fey said as her \"30 Rock\" character Liz Lemon. \nAs Fey was speaking an advertisement for the long canceled NBC series \"Smash\" came across the screen. \n\"Are those 'Smash' people down there again?\" Fey said above the ad. \nMorgan then kicked off the show saying, \"As you can see, everything is going to be just fine... so let's be funny!\" \nThe accident killed one, injured others and caused such damage to Morgan that the comedian was \"still struggling\" months after the incident. \nHowever, on Saturday night, Morgan slipped right back into his old routine, including returning to his most famed \"SNL\" role, Brian Fellow from \"Brian Fellow's Safari Planet.\" \nThose watching at home were also excited over the return of Morgan using the hashtag \"#WelcomeBackTracy.\" \nAway from Morgan's \"30 Rock\" co-stars, there was another big name guest who appeared on Saturday night's episode. Larry David surprised the audience showing up as Bernie Sanders in the series' cold opening, which mocked the latest Democratic debate. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:15:06.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
