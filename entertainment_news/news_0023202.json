It can be backbreaking work,\" said Jesse Graham, hardscape foreman and co-owner of Rochester Landscape Designs, run out of the Blooms & Brick garden center in Webster. \"But driving the machinery, like Bobcats and dump trucks and other big trucks? That's just fun.\"\nIndividual homeowners and large institutions both show an increasing demand for lawn care and landscaping services. For the Finger Lakes region, that means employment opportunities for landscaping and groundskeeping workers are expected to grow 21.3 percent between 2010 and 2020, with 150 annual openings, reports the New York State Department of Labor.\nLandscaper Jesse Graham works at a home in Pittsford on Tuesday, October 6, 2015. (Photo: Mike Bradley)\nMuch of the work is done outdoors in all kinds of weather, and most is seasonal.\nApril through June is spent mostly on maintenance work, such as edging beds, trimming shrubs, cutting away dead branches and mulching. When business slows down in warmer months, 35-year-old Graham switches to working on landscaping projects like the one he started this summer — a backyard project at a Pittsford home with two patios, retaining walls, a kitchen and more — before being swamped again with freshening up properties for the fall.\nOne of the more demanding parts of the job, according to Graham, who lives in Rochester, is realizing after work begins that the grade of the ground won't accommodate approved plans. \"Sometimes you can adjust the grade, but most times you adjust the plans,\" he explained.\nAdjustments also have to be made when homeowners flip-flop on their vision. \"They see the blueprint and give you the go-ahead, and after it's done they say, 'Oh, I thought it was going to look different,' \" noted Graham, who usually attends two trade shows a year. \"Then you have to redo everything. But when you're finally done with a job and everyone loves it, that's the satisfying part.\"\nRobin L.
