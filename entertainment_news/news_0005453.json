Laguna Beach and the surrounding white sand beach coastal areas are considered the “Gem” of Southern California and is known as a bucket list location for travelers from around the world.\nAlong with re-branding and digital expandability, LagunaBeach.com is in production to complete its television and video campaigns. The series of spots being produced will focus on all Lagunabeach.com has to offer. The media plan will focus on local, regional and national advertising. LagunaBeach.com has also inked strategic partnerships to help grow its online and offline marketing channels.\nLagunaBeach.com is considered a premium geodomain. A geodomain refers to domain names that represent geographic entities, such as cities and countries. Examples of premium city geodomains are: Atlanta.com, LosAngeles.com, and LasVegas.com. Since geographical names are limited in number and have extremely high intuitive name recognition, geodomains are highly sought after, with the .com extension geodomains valued the most highly. Collectively, geographic domain names are estimated to represent in excess of $500M a year in gross hotel bookings alone.\nWith its new look and state-of-the-art technologies, LagunaBeach.com is looking to transform into one of the world’s most impressive travel & destination sites.\nFor more info, visit: http://www.lagunabeach.com or email annette(at)lagunabeach(dot)com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018719.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.lagunabeach.com/index.html", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018719.htm"], "published": "2015-10-16T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:26:15.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
