Sir Cliff Richard performs on stage (Ian West/PA) \nOver the decades, the lifelong bachelor has starred in numerous hit films and been at the helm of several TV shows. He is one of Britain’s few enduring pop icons, yet he remains something of an enigma. \nWe showcase some of Sir Cliff’s top quotes and also, what other pop stars have said about him. Cliff Richard in 2012 (Ian West/PA) What Sir Cliff has said over the years \nOn his fans… \n“If you have got the public in the palm of your hand, you can be sure that is where they want to be.” \nOn his religion… \n“I will go as far as I can into rock and roll carrying my Christian banner.” \nOn children… \n“The nice thing about having relatives’ kids around is that they go home.” \nOn his sexuality… \n“I’m aware of the rumours, but I am not gay.” \nOn the music industry… \n“Rock ‘n’ roll can manage without the sex and drugs.” Promoted stories \nOn his achievements… \n“Nobody’s going to catch me now. I’ve had number ones in five decades. Who’s going to do that? First of all, they’ve got to be around for five decades. Many of them barely make five years.” Cliff Richard in 1963 (PA) \nOn music critics… \n“My only gripe is when critics writing the history of rock’n'roll leave me out altogether.” What some stars have said about Sir Cliff \nBob Geldof “It’s never been said, but without Cliff and The Shadows, there’s no English pop business. As George Harrison said: ‘No Shadows, no Beatles’.” John Lennon (Sands/AP/PA) \nJohn Lennon “The first English record that was anywhere near anywhere was Move It by Cliff Richard. Before, there’d been nothing.” \nSting “Cliff Richard is, in my opinion, one of Britain’s finest singers technically and emotionally. I’ve been a fan since Living Doll. Long may he sing.” Freddie Mercury (Marco Arndt/AP/PA) \n“A tremendous influence on my early days as a performer.” \nQueen’s Brian May “When Cliff Richard and The Drifters made their first recording, they brought the stirrings of the new American rock ‘n’ roll to England.” \nThe Who’s Pete Townsend “Cliff has survived and become an artist who cuts across all boundaries making great pop records.” Mick Jagger (Robb D Cohen/Invision) \nSir Mick Jagger “Cliff Richard did have some talent and lasted, whereas others didn’t.” Share article \nStatus Quo’s Rick Parfitt “Cliff Richard: my childhood hero.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:28:50.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
