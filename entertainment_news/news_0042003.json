Photo: Justin Nicolas \nCIRCA: CARNIVAL OF THE ANIMALS\nOpera House, September 24. Until October 4 \n★★★&frac12; \nCarnival of the Animals begins without creatures. Just battered suitcases, a bevy of big and small trunks flipped, swung and hurled by Circa's six-strong female and male cast.\nThen an unpacking begins, a lush and leaping pageant of flying creatures and soaring humans is set free celebrating and underling the fragility of Earth's tiny and enormous beings.\nA mammoth projected shark animation looms as the cast become a protective net for a lone swimmer. Enormous butterflies emerge from trembling chrysalises as Circa members quiver and flutter before octopus-like plant fronds.\nAdvertisement The cast balance horizontally as a lumbering dinosaur, balance loftily on each other's shoulders to skip rope as a two-storey kangaroo and tumble effortlessly in aerial, underwater and desert scenes. The lithe performers lay eggs as squawking chooks, mimic tortoises and zebras and emulate the antics of frogs and whales.\nIn Michaela French's vivid animations, dogs listen to gramophones (a modern update of the His Master's Voice logo), balloons carry a red and yellow-striped circus tent away into the sky and dinosaur bones in a red desert rattle in the dust.\nOne moment is comedy, the next lush drama. My three-year-old was most entranced by the brief spot-lit crooning of a David Lynch-like lounge singer in a long green sequined dress.\nCarnival of the Animals is inspired by Saint-Saens' most popular piece, his 1886 musical suite of 14 movements written for hens and roosters, tortoises, aquarium life, kangaroos, birds and fossils, among others.\nThis is mashed up with evocative new music by Quincy Grant and French's dreamlike video animations.\nNoel Coward's narration of Ogden Nash's humorous verses gets a nod during a sequence featuring a rapping elephant spray-painted onto a wall full of graffiti.\nThe beauty of Circa's show is its marriage of rich, risky and raw acrobatics with music and video.\nIt blends slapstick and melancholy, beauty and awe, and, with the help of a 129-year-old musical suite, manages to keep an audience of nearly 200 small children wide-eyed and whispering \"Ooh\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:52:10.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
