On Oct. 1, a group of musicians came together for “Cover Me,” a benefit concert at High Noon Saloon. \nAccording to the event’s Facebook page , the “Cover Me” event raised more than $5,000. Proceeds went to the bike path assault survivor and Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault. \nA little further down the bike path from the Hoot ‘n Annie String Band, guitarist Curtis Goodman was set up with his six string and a guitar case open for donations. A handmade sign propped up next to the case explained that all tips would go to the assault survivor and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault. \n“I decided that I’m at least going to get $15 or $20 before I leave,” Goodman said. \nHe thought that was the best thing to do, as the High Noon is offering buskers a free beer in exchange for handing over their “Busk the Bike Path” tips. He wanted to at least cover the price of the beer. \nGoodman said he’s been impressed by the Madison music community’s mobilization of support after the assault. \n“It’s the community — and this is my opportunity to be a part of it,” he said. “I love the bike path, so when I heard it’s not a safe place to be, that really bothered me.” \nThat’s what brought violinist Lisa Lathrop out for “Busk the Bike Path” as well. \n“It seems like a good thing to do to raise awareness — to just do something,” she said.
