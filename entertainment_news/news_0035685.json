It’s kind of weird, but it’s nice,” Thompson said from New York, where she was headed to Rockefeller Center to appear on The Today Show, part of a flurry of publicity surrounding renewed interest in the classic movies. \nBack to the Future celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year, but Wednesday has become a sort of unofficial Back to the Future day, since Oct. 21, 2015, was the date that Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) plugged into the DeLorean time machine when he, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) travelled to the future in Back to the Future Part II. \nAfter becoming a household name in Back to the Future, Thompson went on to star in dozens of films and TV shows, including 1986’s Spacecamp, 1987’s Some Kind of Wonderful and the hit sitcom Caroline in the City, which ran from 1995 to 2000. Most recently she’s starred in the ABC Family drama Switched at Birth, marking its fourth season finale on Monday. \nUnder the guidance of director Robert Zemeckis, who went on to direct Forrest Gump, Cast Away and Flight, the cast of Back to the Future had an inkling at the time that they were making something special, Thompson said. \n“It’s just such a joy to participate in someone’s vision. (Zemeckis) would get so excited and gleeful about some crazy detail he’d thought up,” she said. \n“It was a great script and a funny, weird idea, which is what appealed to me about it. Sometimes everything comes together in the right way, and it definitely felt like that.” \nLess appealing were the prosthetics and makeup she had to wear to appear to be in her late 40s in the movies’ 1985 timeline, and in her 70s in the 2015 timeline. \n“Age makeup is kind painful, and it’s strange to act in because if you move your face too much you tear it, and if you tear it you ruin the whole day.” \nBut Thompson, at 54, looks far better today than her faux-aged character in the movies. “It’s a different time to be older now,” she says. “I’m sitting here basically wearing the same dress my daughter would wear. I’ve got the same hair my daughter would wear. We can get away with that stuff.” \nWhile it feels like every hot movie property from the ’80s and ’90s has been revived or rebooted, Thompson is with Zemeckis in firmly believing Back to the Future should be left alone. Although, like castmate Christopher Lloyd, she’d get on board with a sequel if Zemeckis was behind it and reunited the cast, as unlikely as that is to happen. \n“If they were making it and they were asking, I’d be interested,” she said. \nAnother reboot she isn’t holding out hopes of appearing in? Howard the Duck. Thompson starred in the 1986 George Lucas-produced movie about the wisecracking alien duck, widely regarded as one of the worst films of that decade. With Howard popping in the end credits sequence of 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Thompson figures it’s only a matter of a time before Marvel gives the character another shot. But she says there’s no way they’ll be talking to her about a cameo appearance in that movie. \n“I absolutely think they’re going to make another Howard the Duck,” she said. “But I think they would try to distance themselves as far as they could from my Howard the Duck.” \nCineplex Entertainment’s Front Row Centre Events is bringing Back to the Future I and II to theatres across the country on October 21, followed by the full trilogy on October 25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:35:51.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
