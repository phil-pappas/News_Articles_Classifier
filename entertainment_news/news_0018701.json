We have come out being a stronger and more resilient business.\"\nThe November 2014 cyber attack against Sony led to an online leak of employee information, unreleased films and embarrassing in-house emails. \nThe hackers also mounted threats against Sony over the planned Christmas release of \"The Interview,\" which depicts a fictional CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. \nUS investigators have said North Korea, which has repeatedly denied involvement, was behind the attack, but some experts have raised doubts about the conclusions of the FBI probe.\nWashington authorized a new layer of sanctions on several Pyongyang institutions and officials in retaliation for the attack. \nThe impoverished but nuclear-armed state was already heavily sanctioned following a series of nuclear and missile tests staged in violation of UN resolutions.\nConsumer Discretionary Sony Pictures Sony", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:42:46.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
