But he added that any deal would have to make sense financially and logistically for Springfield. \nThe team recently ended its pursuit of waterfront land in downtown Providence for a new stadium. \nSarno said the early discussions were with PawSox co-owner Larry Lucchino and Sam Kennedy, chief operating officer of the team's parent club, the Boston Red Sox. \nSpringfield has not hosted professional baseball in 50 years. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:30:47.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
