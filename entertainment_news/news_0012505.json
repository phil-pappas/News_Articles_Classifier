Hebert/Invision/AP, File) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — TV’s “America’s Next Top Model” is leaving the runway. \nThe CW reality competition series will wrap in December with the current season’s finale. \nIn a statement Wednesday, network President Mark Pedowitz called the series “a global pop culture phenomenon.” \nTyra Banks, the program’s host and executive producer, just launched the syndicated daytime talk show “FABLife.” \n“America’s Next Top Model” debuted in 2003 on the now-defunct UPN channel and was the first series on fledgling CW in 2006. \nThe “America’s Next Top Model” finale will air Dec. 4. \nThere may be another chance to say goodbye. The network is discussing a retrospective that would air in late 2016.
