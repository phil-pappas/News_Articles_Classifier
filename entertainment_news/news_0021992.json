A totem pole, stolen by actor John Barrymore during a sailing trip to Alaska in 1931, was returned to the Tlingit Tribe by the Honolulu Museum of Arts today, where it was on display since the early 1980s. The totem pole was carved by the ancestors of the Tlingit Tribe. The box was a thank you gift for the return of their totem pole.
