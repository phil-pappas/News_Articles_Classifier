We had a remarkable & extensive interaction.”\nThe Prime Minister’s decision to declassify the files came after a request made by Netaji’s family members during an hour-long interaction with him.\nThe family members also urged the Prime Minister that the Government of India should also initiate a process to get the files on Netaji available with foreign governments to also be declassified.\nThe Prime Minister, however, told them: “I see no reason to strangle history. The process of declassification of files relating to Netaji will begin on January 23rd, Netaji’s birthday.”\nHe said he would not only write to them, but also take up the matter during his meetings with foreign leaders, beginning with Russia in December.\nThe Prime Minister said that those nations who forget history also lose the power to create it. He also shared with the family members some instances of how he had recalled Netaji during his term as the Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n“Consider me a part of your family,” Prime Minister Modi said to the family members of Netaji.\nUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh , Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, and Minister of State (MoS) Babul Supriyo were also present on the occasion.\n 14, 2015 9:57 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:14:33.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
