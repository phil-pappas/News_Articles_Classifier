It's important that I've enjoyed the people I've worked with, and I've enjoyed all the various film experiences I've had,\" said Deepika Padukone at the Women of Worth 2015 event here on Wednesday.\nThe \"written off\" period for Deepika was the phase where numerous of her films after \"Om Shanti Om\" and \"Love Aaj Kal\" had flopped at the box-office. Her career revival is largely credited to her performance as a troubled woman in \"Cocktail\", post which she delivered several hits such as \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\", \"Chennai Express\" and \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\".\n\"Hard work is the key to a lot of things, but also it's important to be passionate or rather do what you're passionate about. And most importantly, enjoy yourself along the way - this has been the biggest learning. I've had fun through all the work that I've done and all the amazing people I've worked with, I've really had a good time,\" she said.\nAsked about the people she would like to thank for standing behind her, she said: \"My family has been very encouraging and supportive, and I also think people from within the fraternity... everyone who's given me the opportunity - right from Farah to Shah Rukh to Imtiaz who signed me before my first film released. A lot of people signed me on without seeing any of my work.\"\nDeepika will now be seen in \"Tamasha\" and \"Bajirao Mastani\" later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:56:28.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
