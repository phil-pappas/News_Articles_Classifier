If you are looking for something fun to do, perhaps win a turkey, and meet some old and new friends, this is a good place to go. It also helps support the volunteers that serve our community. If you can't make this Saturday, there will be plenty more in the area. I will compile them and write another post listing them. Also, the Town of Chili highway highway department has begun it's leaf pickup. They have been Tweeting about it lately, so you can follow them HERE and follow along on the streets they are doing. One of their requests is \"Leaf pickup has started! Pile the leaves near the street, but out of the gutter & separate from all other debris-no bags or containers\". They also state they will canvas the town several times before the white stuff hits the streets. They will also begin putting up snow fences, so please give these hardworking men a little courtesy when you see them out. They cannot hear much in their surroundings when they are sucking up the leaves, so be careful driving near them. I would hate to see an injury or worse for leaves. They thank you!\nLast item is that the owners of the Chili Paul Plaza has completed paving the entire parking lot. It has not looked this good since it was first built - and probably better than then! They encountered utility issues that took a little longer than expected. They also replaced the sidewalk in front of the stores. McDonalds is still under construction.\nIt looks as though someone is building out the old Radio Shack, but don't have any idea what is going in there. I have gone through all of the prior minutes, and have NOT seen any plans for a Taco Bell. The convalescent home will be going in next to the electrical substation on Chili Avenue near the railroad tracks.\ne1793157a48949778209a8257a4422ed\nEnjoy the fall colors in our parks, take a hike, grab a pumpkin (Ford's Farm Market, Hellaby Hill, and Stokoe's to name a few) and enjoy the cool crisp air before the winter takes hold of us!\nTown of Chili Parks and Recreation\nMonroe County Parks", "external_links": ["http://townofchili.org/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/Rochester/wp-ROC-OurTownsBlog-7262-37f2513d.jpg", "https://twitter.com/chilidpw", "http://www.chilifire.org/home.php", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb36a1c508d300138d7ebac84ee3b457bc87e642/r=500x319/local/-/media/2015/10/23/Rochester/wp-ROC-OurTownsBlog-7262-37f2513d.jpg", "http://www.townofchili.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=28&Itemid=137", "http://www2.monroecounty.gov/parks", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2270ced781edf5f23e130425a2c0435c80d06db/c=56-0-711-491&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/Rochester/wp-ROC-OurTownsBlog-7262-37f2513d.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:09:08.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
