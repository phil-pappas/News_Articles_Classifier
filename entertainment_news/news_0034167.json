The actress talks about the movie, her comeback plans with Govinda if the script is right and more.\nQ. There were rumours that you were upset with the makers of Bombay Velvet, were you?\nI wasn’t upset but yes I was disappointed. When you put in hard work and you don’t see much of it on screen that is disappointing. I was sceptical to sign the film initially but I love jazz music and that’s why I wanted to do the film.\nQ. Do you regret working in 90s, which lacked experimental cinema?\nNo, not at all. I completely enjoyed the 90s. In fact, I even did experimental films like Aks, Sandhya and Satta way back then. I am happy the way my life and career has shaped up so far.\nQ. Do we get to see you and Govinda together someday?\nI loved the way we did comedy films in the 90s. I totally enjoyed it. Chi Chi (Govinda) has brilliant comic timing. But I feel that films like Dulhe Raja have their own charm, they shouldn’t be remade today. We would love to do a comedy film together if we land up with an appropriate script.\nQ. Have you thought of producing films with your husband Anil Thadani?\nHonestly, I haven’t thought of production till now but will surely do it someday.\nQ. Do your kids watch your films or wish to work in films?\nAnil and I are there to guide them but will stand by them whatever they wish to do in future. They love my film Andaaz Apna Apna and scream whenever they see me on television.\nQ. Tell us something about your role in your next film Shab?\nOnir is a brilliant director. I am playing a woman of substance in the film. It’s actually a beautiful love story of three individuals. I can’t say much about my role.\n Bollywood Raveena Tandon Govinda Bombay Velvet movie Also Read Kangana and Malaika's fashion face off at the India Coutoure Week Salman Khan's 'Rs 25 lakh’ super lawyer It's all work and no time off for Deepika Padukone Kriti, Sooraj, Athiya take flight", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/entertainment-bollywood/article/disappointed-bombay-velvet-raveena-tandon", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/RAVEENA%2008SAVVY.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/RAVEENA%2008SAVVY.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:19:21.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
