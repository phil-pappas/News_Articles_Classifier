Photo: Emma Young \nA West Australian couple have launched a new 'social enterprise' in Northbridge: a place in which the people of Perth can hear and tell stories. \nJohn and Caroline Wood, who run the boutique publisher Margaret River Press, got the idea for a philanthropic Centre for Stories in Perth after a trip east.\nWhile in Melbourne, Ms Wood said they were struck by the city's vibrant arts culture and focus on stories, with year-round festivals and events held by centres such as the Wheeler Centre and Writing Victoria.\nIn another of the cosy spaces at the Northbridge centre. Photo: Emma Young \nShe said Perth had plenty for theatre lovers and traditional writers, with centres such as the KSP Writers' Centre and Peter Cowan Writers Centre in Joondalup, but little to nurture the art of storytelling itself, whether written, recorded or performed.\nAdvertisement \"I felt that there was something missing in Perth, [and that it] was ready for a centre to collect and share stories,\" she said.\n\"This is a way of giving back to WA and continuing to create energy.\"\nThe events program at the new Centre is already packed. Photo: Emma Young \nThe couple bought a 19th century-restored home on Aberdeen Street and will use its Heritage Listed front rooms for events while developing the rear with offices, a cafe and handful of apartments to rent out. \nThey will seek official not-for-profit status as well as government funding and sponsorships to develop the program, which will include working with communities to collect and record stories for showcases online, as well as for events such as Perth International Arts Festival.\nAlso scheduled are literary events, such as book launches titles from Margaret River Press and other local publishers, low-cost writing and publishing workshops and eventually 'open mic' storytelling nights.\nEvents so far have included a sold-out evening performance of readings by leading WA writers such as Amanda Curtin and David Wish Wilson, and a group writing session called Shut Up and Write!.\nNext on the list is an evening of storytelling around the Indian Festival of Lights and a workshop on social media for writers.\nThey will work with existing community organisations such as Barefaced Stories and the Storytelling Guild of Australia WA, will collect and exhibit stories from groups including refugee groups and the Family Inclusion Network of WA.\nMs Wood said the goal was to remind people of their common humanity.\n\"Perth is a diverse landscape,\" she said.\n\"More than one-third of us have been born overseas and those stories are not reflected in most of the written product and the media - the dominant voices don't necessarily represent what you see walking down the street in Northbridge.\n\"So we will be partnering with some groups to paint a more accurate portrait ... we want this to be a space for everyone.\"\nWA's writing scene is serviced mainly by University of WA Press, Fremantle Press and indigenous publisher Magabala Books.\nThough they are the largest, in the national context they are small and rely heavily on UWA (in the first case) and the state government (in the latter) for survival. Boutique presses, such as Margaret River's, are as much a labour of love as the works they produce.\nIllustrating the rule of love over money for local tale-spinners was the recent release of Macquarie University research that found Australian book authors earned on average less than a third of their income – about $12,900 – from producing original work, making up the shortfall from associated work, such as teaching or editing.\nIt is in this context the state government this year halved funding for the WA Premier's book awards , forcing them to move to every second year, announcing the cuts on the eve of Perth Writer's Festival.\nAwards judge Michael Campbell told WAtoday at the time that the government had \"deeply underestimated\" the cultural and economic value of the awards.\n\"Our places are known and understood through the expression of culture and one of the most powerful forms of that is writing,\" he said.\nA paper on the WA literary scene presented at an annual conference of the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing said people became aware of places' geographical and cultural diversity largely through their representation in movies and books. \nThe paper, by American English professor and publisher Per Henningsgaard, said that in WA lack of access to the \"gatekeepers of cultural production\" such as publishers and arts organisations slowed our reach into the public imagination, resulting in our under-representation in both the national and overseas consciousness. \nMore at the Centre for Stories website .\nFollow WAtoday on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:42:54.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
