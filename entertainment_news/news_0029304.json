Made under the Cinema Mane banner, the makers had to tackle many issues and overcome several hurdles to ensure its release today, and one reason for this is because it is allegedly based on a real-life murder case that took place on a ring road in the city a few years ago. \"The movie is about many true stories and the ring road story is just one of them,\" clarifies director Priya Belliappa.\nAlthough she spoke to many people, a lot of Priya's material was from newspaper reports, but they don't usually provide complete information, so she has taken some cinematic liberties. \"When you write a film, there's a starting point and then there is something beyond that that you have to make cinematically to take the story forward. There are many aspects of a story that you have to fish out, which are not there in a newspaper article. The report will just say that there is an incident, but what happened, why it happened, how it happened and what the motive was â€” all that is hearsay and you have to make it seem real in a film. So I have taken liberties in terms of filling in those gaps,\" says Priya.\nSo what can people expect when they go to watch the movie? \"A lot of people think that they know what the movie is about, but the first 15 minutes will make you feel otherwise. There are many different stories that are all tied together. Anyone who watches the film will come out feeling that there is some aspect of their lives in it. It is a new kind of commercial venture that is entertaining and offers something new in terms of the format, story and the way that relationships are portrayed. It is based on truth on many levels, which gets unraveled as you watch the movie,\" she adds.\nThe all-woman crew had over 25 women working on the project and Priya believes that technically, visually and screenplay-wise, it is on par with any movie that is made in the country.
