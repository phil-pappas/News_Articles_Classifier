By ADRIANA IRIS BOATWRIGHT From demographics to politics, Latinos have transformed and revolutionized America.\nFor example, did you know St. Augustine, Fla., and Sante Fe, N.M., were Hispanic cities founded before Plymouth, Mass.?\nThe Latino population in the United States, according to the Census Bureau, was 55 million as of 2014.\nThat means 55 million Latinos are steering the wheels of the national landscape, making up 17.4 percent of the population.\nTheir influence affects everything from pop culture to politics.\nAnd from Sept. 15-Oct. 15, Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates the Latino culture, including U.S. Latinos’ impact on the nation.\nSavannah gets in on the celebration Oct. 10 at the 10th annual Fiesta Latina on River Street featuring a display of colors, flags, food and art from every part of Latin America.\nMarisol Rodriguez, executive secretary of the Latin American Services Organization and one of the coordinators of Fiesta Latina, gave us the scoop on what to expect.\n“We will have folkloric dances from various Latin American countries as well as a salsa singer coming directly from Puerto Rico, an Atlanta-based group that performs bachata genre, originally from the Dominican Republic, and a band from South Carolina that will be performing various Mexican genres,” Rodriguez said.\n“In addition, we will have a clown show for all the kids, booths with food from different local vendors, informative organizations, medical clinics, arts and crafts and much more.”\nRodriguez explains why it’s important to recognize the contributions of Latinos in the U.S.\n“I am witness that our Latino culture is one that contributes immensely in many positive ways toward this society.\n“Celebrating our culture is one way to integrate ourselves into this community and at the same time, educate our city on the richness of our culture and traditions,” she said.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Fiesta Latina\nWhen: Noon-7 p.m. Oct. 10\nWhere: River Street, Rousakis Plaza\nCost: Free\nInfo: 855-837-2260\nSCHEDULE\nNoon: Blessing/National Anthem\n12:15 p.m.: Welcome message by LASO Board\n12:30 p.m.: Latin American Flags Parade\n1 p.m.: Payaso Chocolatin (kids’ clown show)\n2 p.m.: Rafy Santana & Orquestra (Tropical)\n3 p.m.: Raices Peruanas (Peru)\n3:30 p.m.: Hispanic Heritage (Puerto Rico, Colombia, Espana)\n4 p.m.: Coastal Casineros (Cuba)\n4:30 p.m.: Savannah Christian Band\n5 p.m.: Zumba with Michelle Rivera\n5:30 p.m.: Grupo Impacto Band (Cumbia)\n6 p.m.: Tradicion Latina (Mexico)\n6:30 p.m.: Orgullo Panameno (Panama)\n6:45 p.m.: Capoeira (Brazil)\n7 p.m.: Bachata Urbana (Dominican Republic)", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14768017.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14768017.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZ8mc)", "https://bit.ly/ZyZaur", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosavannah/id626862925?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n53744379", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/2Ix6dHF.png", "https://bit.ly/Ke006c"], "published": "2015-10-07T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:30:55.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
