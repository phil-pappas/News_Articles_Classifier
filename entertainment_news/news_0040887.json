We've been taking it out... to give it a trial before we take it on tour... (It is) do-able. \n\"I can think of so many male artists who do go on tour and they leave their families behind.\" \nUnderwood acknowledges having her son on the tour bus will mean extra chores for her, but she is determined to make it work. \n\"Not only do I have to worry about picking up my show clothes, but I also have to pack Isaiah's bags,\" she adds. \"Then I have to feed him and everything else - it presents its own set of problems. But he is my number one priority.\" \nUnderwood welcomed the little boy in February. He is her first child with her ice hockey player husband Mike Fisher. \nShe adds of becoming a mother, \"I think I've been doing a pretty good job so far. Isaiah is amazing. I was never really a baby person, but he is so special.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:53:25.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
