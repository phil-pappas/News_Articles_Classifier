Shooting of the movie, which narrates the story of a loner who lives in a city will start rolling in November.\nThe movie is based on a real life character and the director explains, “I was inspired by the life of a man called Lona who I knew. He was an introvert. He used to talk only to himself and nature. I witnessed his life and death. Even after his death, I couldn’t remove his memories from my mind. So I thought of writing it down and making a movie based on it. He is just an inspiring factor to me. I am not recreating his life in my film,” says Biju.\nAfter writing the script, Biju approached Indrans as he couldn’t find any other person to portray this character. Indran’s latest outing in lead role was Buddhanum Chaplinum Chirikkunnu.\n“I could have chosen any other actor. But I wanted to show justice to my character. Hence, I zeroed in on Indrans. After listening to the script, he totally got involved into the story,” he adds. Shooting of Lona will take place in Kochi. “We have plans to screen Lona in festivals and release online.”\n entertainment Mollywood Indrans Also Read Aishwarya Sakhuja gets surprise on Nach Baliye sets Fashion forward celebrities add colour to the PGA red carpet It's Official!
