Images of an evolving city are at the center of a newly released documentary by William Paterson University sociologist and Paterson native Vincent Parrillo, which that was shown at the university’s Shea Performing Arts Center on Wednesday. \nVincent Parrillo, a William Paterson University professor, Paterson native and creator of the documentary, said he had hoped to shed light on a rich history, as well as a side of the city quite different from the common portrayal of urban blight. \n“I’m a firm believer that the shadows of the past live in the present,” he said. \n“Paterson and Its People,” which Parrillo co-produced, wrote and narrated, traces and celebrates the city's changing demographics, from the days of the Native American Lenni-Lenape tribe through the waves of European immigrants to the present Hispanic, African-American and Middle-Eastern makeup. \nIt touches on the great fire of 1902, the 1913 silk strike, the premieres of native son Lou Costello's films and the opening of Hinchliffe Stadium. It shows there were Polish, Syrian, Russian, Turkish and Chinese immigrants in 1920. \nThe diverse lineage can be seen today in the many sculptures by Gaetano Federici, an Italian immigrant, and the neo-gothic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist on Grand and Main streets, which was “built by the Irish for the Irish,” Parrillo said. Even faded lettering, street names and signs tell a story, he said, pointing out an early 20th-century sign promoting Haledon as a destination for “fresh air of the country.” \nIt's Parrillo's fourth documentary and his third on Paterson. He also co-produced the film “Gaetano Federici: The Sculptor Laureate of Paterson,” released in 2013, and “Smokestacks and Steeples: A Portrait of Paterson,” released in 1992. \n“I have that emotional bond that Patersonians or ex-Patersonians have,” said Parrillo, who was born and raised in the city and now lives in Ridgewood. \nHis target audience is anyone who has lived in Paterson, especially children growing up in the city. \nThe documentary ends in the present, “with a story yet to be told by those who are there,” he said. \nParrillo also is planning a documentary about the artists and musicians of Paterson, he said. \nThe documentary aired on NJTV on Saturday and is scheduled to be screened at 3 p.m. on Oct. 11 at the WPU library auditorium in an event that's free and open to all, Parrillo said. DVDs will also be sold at the Great Falls visitor center and Lambert Castle, he said. \nEmail: parkm@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:08:49.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
