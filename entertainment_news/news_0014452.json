Although, she wasn't happy when I chose such an obvious place! \n''Pa said one thing, 'What do you want that for?!' He hates tattoos and piercings.'' \nThe 18-year-old model is very ''proud'' of her down-to-earth grandfather and is grateful he leads a more low-key life than bandmate Sir Mick Jagger . \nShe told HELLO! Fashion Monthly magazine: ''We're really proud of Pa. He's just so humble about it [fame]. He's not all over the place, he's just so damn cool. \n''It would probably be a different story if we were being chased all the time. I can't imagine what it must be like for Mick.'' \nLast month, Charlotte was left devastated when a Â£32,000 taxidermy wolf -a gift from her grandfather after she underwent surgery on her back - was stolen from her West London home by a group of partygoers, and she is now feeling relieved after her beloved animal, who she has named Frostbite, was handed in to police. \nShe said: ''I'm just very relieved he's safe and sound. I thought they'd thrown him out the window and went outside expecting to see a crushed wolf. Then I realised they'd taken him. I was so upset. \n''It is not something I'd normally receive for Christmas - it was the fact I'd survived something really horrible. And I really love wolves and knew I could never have a pet one, so I got Frostbite.'' \nThe new issue of HELLO! Fashion Monthly is on sale tomorrow (06.10.15).
