By Will Graves PITTSBURGH — These Chicago Cubs are supposed to be too young to be here. Or maybe they’re just too good to care.\nJake Arrieta allowed four hits in nine dominant innings and the Cubs rolled to a 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL wild-card game on Wednesday night.\nArrieta struck out 11 without a walk. He also dusted himself off getting plunked by Pittsburgh reliever Tony Watson to send the Cubs to the NL Division Series in St. Louis starting on Friday.\nDexter Fowler homered and scored three times for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber added a towering two-run shot off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole as Chicago raced to an early lead and let Arrieta do the rest.\nThe largest crowd ever at PNC Park failed to rattle Arrieta or one of baseball’s youngest teams. Manager Joe Maddon’s club played with swagger and confidence and looked right at home while snapping a\nnine-game playoff losing streak that dated to the 2003 NL Championship Series.\nPittsburgh was knocked out after finishing second in the majors with 98 victories this year. Last season, the Pirates also were shut out on four hits at home in the wild-card game, losing to San Francisco.\nThe bearded, 29-year-old Arrieta, still unbeaten since July 25, stretched his remarkable second half — in which he posted a 0.75 ERA — into the opening round of the postseason.\nThe righty, who led the majors with 22 wins, even laughed off a weird sequence in the seventh when Watson’s fastball hit him in his left side. The benches and bullpens cleared when Watson was issued a warning, leading to little more than a few heated exchanges along the first base line.\nPirates utility player Sean Rodriguez, who’d already been pulled, was ejected and proceeded to give an unsuspecting water cooler a series of one-two combinations, eventually sending it tumbling to the ground.\nChicago ab r h bi Pittsburgh ab r h bi\nFowler cf 4 3 3 1 G.Polanco rf 4 0 0 0\nSchwarber rf 3 1 2 3 J.Harsn 3b-ss 3 0 0 0\nDenorfia rf 0 0 0 0 McCutchen cf 4 0 1 0\nBryant lf-3b 3 0 0 0 S.Marte lf 4 0 0 0\nRizzo 1b 4 0 0 0 Cervelli c 3 0 1 0\nLa Stella 3b 2 0 0 0 N.Walker 2b 3 0 0 0\nA.Jksn ph-lf 2 0 0 0 Mercer ss 2 0 0 0\nSt.Castro 2b 4 0 0 0 Ramrz ph-3b 1 0 0 0\nM.Montero c 4 0 1 0 S.Rodriguez 1b 0 0 0 0\nA.Russell ss 4 0 1 0 P.Alvarez ph-1b 3 0 0 0\nArrieta p 2 0 0 0 G.Cole p 1 0 0 0\nBastardo p 0 0 0 0\nSnider ph 1 0 1 0\nWatson p 0 0 0 0\nSoria p 0 0 0 0\nMorse ph 1 0 1 0\nMelancon p 0 0 0 0\nTotals 32 4 7 4 Totals 30 0 4 0\nChicago 102 010 000 — 4\nPittsburgh 000 000 000 — 0\nE—A.Russell (1), N.Walker (1).
