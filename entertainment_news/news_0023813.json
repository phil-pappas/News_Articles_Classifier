The REBEL FOR TORRID capsule collection will be unveiled at MILK in Hollywood on October 22, 2015 .\nRebel, who is best known for her roles in films such as Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect 1 & 2 , and who will appear in the upcoming film How To Be Single in theaters February 12, 2016 , is a fan of Torrid's sexy, edgy fashion making the collaboration a perfect fit.\n\"I'm a creative person. I create characters, scripts, jokes, music… so I thought, why not clothes?\" explains Rebel. \"I've been wearing Torrid's clothing for years, and so it just seemed like a natural fit to collaborate with them.\"\nThe limited-edition collection has Rebel's personal touch all over it. Several pieces feature her script 'Rebel' signature. A koala motif nods to her Australian background. Even small details, like microphone-shaped hardware and charms, are inspired by her early career in stand-up comedy. The look is distinctively Rebel -- casual street style mixed with a few red-carpet-ready pieces.\nFriends of Rebel, Torrid representatives and select members of the press will gather for an intimate event at MILK Thursday night, October 22, 2015 . The brand will toast this exciting partnership and unveil a first look at the collection with a pop-up shop that brings REBEL FOR TORRID to life.\nLisa Harper , Torrid CEO states, \"Working with Rebel was so much fun. We're thrilled with the results. This is the preview event to celebrate the collection. Our customers love Rebel -- we can't wait to show it to them.\"\nREBEL FOR TORRID will be sold exclusively in Torrid stores in the U.S. and Canada , and online at Torrid.com starting the first week of November 2015 .
