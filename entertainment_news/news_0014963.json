His celebrity wife, Khloe Kardashian, has been at his side. Kardashian, whose divorce from Odom is not final, has been making medical decisions about his treatment, a person with knowledge of the situation said.\nAs Lamar Odom lingers in hospital, tourists descend on Nevada brothel Javier Panzar and John M.

Glionna) Since Odom's arrival, the trauma unit has often been chaotic and stressful, Jewell said.\n“Yesterday, it was very loud,” she told a Times reporter who gained access to the hospital Thursday. “They kept coming in and out.”\nShe added, “This is a very small unit, but when they congregate – [nursing] staff, managers, security and others – all of that noise is disruptive.”\nAlthough Cooper, Jewell's daughter, is being heavily sedated during treatment for a bowel obstruction, she awakened in the middle of the night Wednesday because of the noise, her mother said.\n“It sounds like they’re having a party on this floor. Don’t they know people are sleeping?” Jewell Quote: d her daughter as saying.\nA few rooms down, behind a closed curtain and across from the nurses' station, medical staff scrambled to treat Odom. The former Laker and Clipper collapsed after a four-day stint that involved drinking, drugs and sex at the Love Ranch Vegas brothel in Crystal, Nev., authorities say.\nA review of Lamar Odom's career, beginning with his days as a Clipper and continuing through his stops with the Lakers and Mavericks.\nSecurity on the hospital floor was tight. A nurse stopped all visitors, including one man returning to visit his wife, who reportedly had been at the hospital for more than a month.\nA security guard vouched for him, Jewell said. “He’s OK,” the guard said. “I remember him.”\nCooper’s husband, George, said each time he left his wife’s floor, he encountered people in the elevator who asked about Odom’s condition. George Cooper replied that he didn't know.\nCooper, 43, said he has seen several extremely tall men he assumes are basketball players visit Odom’s room over the last few days. He said he was not an NBA fan, however, and could not identify them.\nKobe Bryant was among Odom's visitors, according to sources with the Lakers who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak was there too, the sources said.\nCooper said he wishes Odom well, but his main concern is his wife.\n“I could care less whether it’s Obama or whoever is here, just as long as my wife is getting the care she needs,” he said.\nJewell said it isn’t right that average patients like her daughter must put up with the distraction.\n“It’s not fair that innocent patients have to feel the ripple effect” of Odom being at the hospital, she said.\nShe looked around as she heard doors open and close on the ward.\n“It’s quiet now,” Jewell said. “But it wasn’t yesterday.”\nBrown is a special correspondent.
