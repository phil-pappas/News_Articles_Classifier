Oh, those were the days! Paul Wesley's fresh, young face, Nina Dobrev's hair, Ian Somerhalder's everything. Which is why I get so nervous when The Vampire Diaries decides to do long-ago flashbacks of its own. Yes, we get to see some great costumes, but we're also forced to rethink kisses of old (and what certain moments even meant). Don't mess with my memories, show! Anyway, in this episode, we learn that Stefan had a first love before Katherine. Dammit! Dammit all!\n Valerie and Stefan's courtship story takes up the majority of this episode, so there's not a lot of forward momentum. However, we might (and this is a big might) have met our new big bad. Or at least one of them. Plus, there was a pregnancy. Given the fact that most of these people are just legit monsters now, it came as a huge surprise. Let's dive in.\nBonnie and 2 Goofballs Go to Myrtle Beach Damon has tracked Oscar (this is the sixth heretic, in case you've forgotten) (you've definitely forgotten) to Myrtle Beach, which he tells Bonnie and Alaric while looking like this:\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail CW More From Cosmopolitan Oh, also, Bonnie had another one of her terrible visions that's all blood and writhing and pain and X scars and she fainted for 10 minutes. She asks Alaric one more time: Did he destroy that Phoenix Stone? He gives such an over-the-top and obviously lying answer that Bonnie for real should've known. But I mean, again, Damon did come out looking like this:\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail CW So we can kinda forgive her. Ian Somerhalder's abs are the exact opposite of nightmarish visions.\nIn Myrtle Beach, Oscar is living the ideal party-boy-on-a-perpetual-spring break life, macking on girls (or escorts, we find out), drinking out of bowls, and just generally living free, man, outside of Lily's watchful eye. He doesn't want to go back and when he sees the gang, he doesn't even realize they are Lily's enemies. Plus, he has a past with Damon and his abs. Oscar convinced Damon to take sick leave and not fight in the battle of Gettysburg for the South.\nFor the most part, you're thinking, It's gonna be crazy easy to capture this guy. But then he goes to help siphon Bonnie's pain from these visions and he instantly knows that the Phoenix Stone is still around and goes into attack mode.\nWhen the gang recovers, Alaric admits that he didn't destroy it, because Jo was the love of his life and he wants her back. Bonnie is mad, but first, the mission. The whole gang capture Oscar, vervain him, and bring him back to Mystic Falls, only to have Valerie \"kill\" him at the end of the episode.\nSo back to the stone. If you're thinking: Hm, couldn't Alaric at least, like, think about bringing Aunt Jenna back too, because it's super rude that he says Jo is the love of his life and not Aunt Jenna (maybe he means second life) ? Well, then you don't remember the premiere, you fool (and you also are very loyal and beautiful), because he's been keeping Jo's body preserved. He takes Bonnie to show her. I watch Arrow and i Zombie too, and it was at this point that I was like, Maybe I watch too many shows were I have to see corpses. And then they did a weird zoom on Jo's ring and I lost my mind.\nAnyway, the stone is still not destroyed, but Bonnie and Alaric end the episode looking in some books for their next move.\nHey There, Michael Trevino The flash-forward had a few reveals this episode; most importantly, Tyler is still alive three years from now. Stefan tells him his scar opened and he doesn't have much time. They've been teasing this scar too much at this point. Tell us what it means, writer gods!\nIn the future, Stefan also burns his very nice car, but can't part with his diary (which, at one point, he did burn, so, like, I guess he just feels it's redundant to burn it again because it will just always find its way back to him), which gets us to…\nTrue Love Definitely Happens With the Girl/Guy You Lost Your Virginity To This whole episode Caroline just had to listen to Valerie tell her love story, the whole time thinking, I wonder what Klaus is doing right now (JK, I made that last part up, but you can read more about it in my fan fiction).\nSo basically, Lily sent her boyfriend, Julian, and Valerie to check on Stefan in 1863. She wanted to see if he was OK, but also if he still loved and missed her, before heading off to Europe. Valerie and Stefan got to talking at a fair and just, like, instantly fell in love. Don't question it. Then Valerie used her locket magic to evade Julian's watchful eye and escaped to the woods with human Stefan.\nThen they do it. It's his first time. Is it hot? Kinda. I don't know, the whole \"virginity\" aspect of it seemed cheap to me. Is this the way people thought about sex then? Wouldn't he have been surprised that she wanted to have sex with him? Wouldn't he have tried to be a \"gentleman\" a little bit more, if just for the sake of what year it was? Maybe I'm being a naive prude about how much sex teens liked to have, and how, in the 1860s.\nAfter they're done, he takes her to his mother's grave and says he brings violets to it. When she was sick, his father asked him to go get the flowers for an herbal tonic, but by the time he came back with them, she had been sent to the sanitorium. He wishes he had been faster. Valerie tells him there's no way being faster would've helped her, the flowers had no medicinal value. Then Lucian comes and takes her away.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x260/gallery-1445614975-picture-1-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445615076-picture-2-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445614975-picture-1-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x347/gallery-1445614975-picture-1-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x417/gallery-1445614975-picture-1-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x442/gallery-1445615076-picture-2-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x564/gallery-1445615076-picture-2-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x490/landscape-1445614975-picture-1-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x368/gallery-1445615076-picture-2-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x737/gallery-1445615076-picture-2-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445614975-picture-1-damon.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x276/gallery-1445615076-picture-2-damon.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:27:26.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
