Nee history lo blood undemo...na bloodke history undi ,\" (loosely translates to, your history might have a lot of blood, but my blood has a history of its own) thunders Balayya in the recently released teaser of Dictator , that has gone viral. Designed for the diehard 'Nandamuri fans' to scream and hoot, the punch dialogue epitomises the tokenism that encapsulates the brand of hero worship Tollywood thrives on — reminding the audiences who the protagonist's father/family is. The tendency is perhaps best summed up as the ' Tu jaanta hai na mera baap kaun hai? ' syndrome, a la erring motorists who drop names at traffic cops to wriggle out of a sticky spot.\nMy family is the greatest For the uninitiated, watching how mana star sons vie to reinforce their family heritage on screen — whether through remixed old songs, movie titles or dialogues — could come across as anything from being plain cheesy to downright hilarious. The antara of the Kung Fu Kumari song that goes Megameter Megameter Neelo Undi Megameter ... from Ram Charan's Bruce Lee is a direct reference to his Megastar dad, who also appeared in a cameo.\nHis cousin, Allu Arjun paid the whackiest homage ever to the Megastar's legacy in his debut film, Gangotri. The Stylish Star danced, dressed in a langa voni to the song Mavayyadi Mogalturu, Maa Nannadi Palakollu, which goes on to pinpoint his roots to the native villages of his uncle Chiranjeevi and his grandfather Allu Ramalingaiah.\nEven Power Star Pawan Kalyan, who famously announced, \" Naku varasatvam vaddu... ,\" a couple of years ago, played the 'Mega brother' card to perfection in his maiden film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi .\nIn one scene, Pawan and late ANR's granddaughter Supriya are shown flaunting each other's family credentials. It came as no surprise then when Akhil made a last-minute entry in the 'Akkineni family film', Manam , which was his grandfather ANR's last film, in what could be construed as a cinematic passing of the mantle.\nIt all boils down to playing to the sentiments of the critical mass — the fan base, reckons Nandi Award-winning Telugu cinema historian, Harikrishna Mamidi. \"Fan culture in the twin states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is a reflection of identity politics rooted in caste and region that plays out onscreen. The nomenclature of the fan clubs themselves, named after their favourite hero's surname or title — Mega Fans, Akkineni Fans, Nandamuri Fans, Ghattamaneni Fans etc. — are rooted more in the ethnicity and demographic roots of their favourite superstars than acting prowess. So, it's imperative for every star son worth his salt to first win the acceptance of the core fan base, by reinforcing his familial lineage,\" he conjectures.\nMass appeasement\nWhile most Tollywood stars are unabashed in flaunting their son-of-the-soil credentials, a select few are more subtle. Take the introduction scene of Pokiri in which Mahesh Babu is introduced amidst a splash of red chilies among other vegetables. As a native of Burripalem, Guntur which is known to produce one of the most potent varieties of chillies in the country, Mahesh's positioning wasn't lost on his ilk.\nThe trend started with second generation heroes like Balakrishna (son of NTR) and Nagarjuna in the '80s itself. It used to be subtle initially. In the 1984 film Mangammagari Manavadu, every time Bhanumathi proclaimed, ' Vadiki antha valla thatha polike ,' referring to her grandson Balakrishna, the crowds burst into thunderous applause, recollects Harikrishna, saying, \"The scene where Balayya launches into a tirade, elucidating the greatness of his vamsham (family), is what prepared the ground for this kind of lip service dedicated to family roots. Nagarjuna too tried to mimic some of his father's onscreen idiosyncrasies, but they didn't quite evoke the same kind of crowd response, probably because ANR didn't enjoy the same mass appeal that NTR did. Hence we don't see the Akkineni family heroes flaunt their lineage tag as explicitly onscreen as those belonging to the Mega family or the Nandamuri clan.\"\nThe '90s sealed it The emergence of factionist dramas like Samarasimha Reddy and Narasimha Naidu in the late '90s ushered in a new era of familial chest thumping, so to speak, in what was a newly liberalised India. Once again it was Balayya who was pushing the envelope, mouthing one cheesy punch dialogue after another, unabashedly heaping hyperbolic praise on his great ancestry. Chiranjeevi who'd played the working class people's hero until then too jumped on to the bandwagon with Indra (2002). \"The faction-based movies were a reflection of disenchantment among the masses in the wake of a newly globalised economy, which threatened to challenge the societal norms and values. So Telugu filmmakers provided comfort to the disillusioned masses through the benevolent dictator-like protagonists who essentially reinforced the feudal past, albeit with a golden heart. Outlandish dialogues that blatantly boasted of their fine breeding became the order of the day,\" elaborates film activist Mahesh Kathi.\nIt was also the time when Chiranjeevi was in the last phase of his Tollywood reign and his legacy had to be preserved even as ground was being prepared for the succession of the next generation of stars like Allu Arjun and Ram Charan from the Mega clan. Around the same time NTR junior staked claim to the Nandamuri legacy picking the pieces from his illustrious uncle, Balakrishna. Only, he pushed the bar further positioning himself as a reincarnation of his grandfather NTR. \" Cycle meeda vachi sanchalanalu srushtinchina charitra marchi poyara, leda cycle meeda inkevaru radu anukunnara ,\" (Cycle, symbol of TDP founded by NTR being the reference to the dramatic political victory in 1983) announced NTR Jr in the introduction scene of 2008 Kantri .\nIt's a free for all now Of late though, with the influx of a slew of star nephews and sons-in-law — Sai Dharam Tej, Varun Tej, Sushanth Akkineni, Sudheer Babu (Krishna's son-in-law) — the dynamics of onscreen familial associations are changing. From remixing old hit songs of his uncle Chiranjeevi and naming his next film, Supreme , after a hit song from Chiru's Yamudiki Mogudu , Sai Dharam Tej is leaving no stone unturned in playing the Mega nephew. Ditto with Sudheer Babu, his recent film Mosagallaku Mosagadu was named after the 1971 cult classic his father-in-law Krishna acted in. Now, it's becoming a bit of a free for all with the likes of Nithiin being happy to play the Pawan Kalyan fan boy on screen, much to the glee of the Power Star fans.\nFunny, how hard mana stars try to assert who or what they represent just to entertain us. So in such a scenario you can't help but root for a Ravi Teja when he says, \" Nenu support tho paiki vochhinodini kadu , solo ga paikochinodni .\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:42:55.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
