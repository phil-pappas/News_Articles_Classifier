Bands such as the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Henry Threadgill's Air and ensembles led by Roscoe Mitchell, Anthony Braxton and many more revivified jazz at a time when it seemed in peril – economically, artistically and otherwise.\nThe epic story of the AACM made for deeply satisfying reading in George Lewis' 2008 book, \"A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music\" (University of Chicago Press). But could this tome, packed with copious detail and rigorous historical analysis, lend itself to operatic treatment?\nThat question emerged in dramatic fashion Friday night at the Museum of Contemporary Art, where a small cast of stellar singers, the International Contemporary Ensemble and members of the AACM offered the world premiere of \"Afterword, An Opera.\" Written by Lewis and directed by Sean Griffin in collaboration with Catherine Sullivan, \"Afterword\" achieved inexorable dramatic power in the first act but struggled to sustain it in the second. Even when theatrical aspects flagged, however, the music proved gripping, intelligently conceived and deftly performed.\nThe first act of \"Afterword,\" in fact, can be considered a chamber-opera masterpiece unto itself, telling the story of the AACM in poetically allegorical form. Rather than assign a large cast of singers to play specific characters in the AACM's history, Lewis ingeniously gave three vocalists the task of expressing the ideas that inspired the emergence of the organization.\nThrough individual arias, duos and trios, the singers dispatched dialogue drawn from the pages of Lewis' book and from personal recordings made during the AACM's beginnings. In so doing, Lewis captured the moments of struggle and perseverance that brought the AACM to life, without getting bogged down in exactly who said what to whom.\nBetter still, the opera — like the book — reached back to 19th-century, post-slavery America and the despair of life amid institutional racism in the South. When, early in the opera, the singers exclaim, \"We had to get out, we had to get out,\" we are witnessing the origins of the Great Migration of African-Americans northward to Chicago (and other urban centers). This vast influx of humanity and artistic genius made Chicago a jazz nexus and gave rise to the birth of the AACM, and \"Afterword\" captured the sweep of this narrative in bracing ways.\nThe music Lewis penned for soprano Joelle Lamarre, contralto Gwendolyn Brown and tenor Julian Terrell Otis unfolded in long, lush, lyric lines conveying the ardor of the protagonists in building the AACM. As the singers delivered these mostly rhapsodic phrases, the International Contemporary Ensemble performed a pointillistic score bristling with snippets of phrases, dabs of instrumental color and multiple swaths of interlocking rhythm.\nThe sharp contrast between silken strands of sung melody and a spiky, nervously articulated instrumental fabric created tremendous musical tension and drove the proceedings ever forward. So did the creative staging, in which the singers delivered their impassioned lines while additional performers moved silently around them, choreographically evoking the action articulated in the libretto.\nA Chicago cemetery scene provided some of the most eloquent music and drama of the first act, conjuring an otherworldly conversation between two AACM founders, Kelan Phil Cohran and Muhal Richard Abrams (both, by the way, are still very much alive today).\n\"The music was overwhelming. Like stepping into paradise,\" one voice sings, in describing the sounds of Chicago jazz in the mid-20th century.\n\"We looked up on day. All that was snatched away,\" sings another, in lamenting the decay of the Chicago jazz landscape in the 1960s. From this loss — and from the realization that the North was not exactly the \"paradise\" envisioned in the Great Migration — comes the desire to create a new scene, a new music, a new organization, the formation of the AACM bringing the first act to a rousing climax.\nBut Lewis and his collaborators faced a more difficult task in the second act, for the prospect of watching AACM figures argue about the meanings and purpose of their organization does not match the dramatic grist of its inception. Though the second act cast welcome light on the AACM's early triumphs in Europe, poignantly illuminating the musicians' ambivalence toward the adulation thrust upon them in Paris, other scenes sounded more theoretical than dramatic.\nWhen a singer proclaims \"the music has a lot to do with disrupting any status quo or system,\" it's clear that \"Afterword\" has segued from the realm of the theater into the halls of the academy. Yet even when the dramatic action came to a near standstill, Lewis' score never lost vitality, rhythmic surge, shimmering color or thematic complexity. Though obviously taking on a terrifically demanding piece, the instrumentalists of the International Contemporary Ensemble performed it — from behind a scrim — with dexterity, poise and control.\nThe cameo appearances of several members of the AACM (Coco Elysses, Douglas Ewart, Ann Ward and Khari B.) worked well as an opening to the second act, serving as a kind of improvised overture. But these musicians were less persuasively integrated into later portions of the production.\nOne hesitates to draw too many conclusions from a first viewing of a work as intricate and weighty as this, but \"Afterword\" might be more compelling as a one-act opus. By carrying the unstoppable momentum of the first act directly into a shortened version of what's now the second, Lewis and colleagues could arrive at a more cohesive whole, and without burning off hard-won intensity.\nRegardless of how the piece evolves, however, its first act proved unequivocally that Lewis' book indeed contains the makings of a significant opera.\nAnother wave of editing could make the most of what Lewis, Griffin, Sullivan and a gathering of remarkably accomplished musicians already have achieved in \"Afterword.\"\nWhich is quite a bit.\nHoward Reich is a Tribune critic.\n\"Afterword, An Opera\" plays at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 220 E.
