The actress, currently promoting her film ​Meadowland ​, appeared on ​Watch What Happens Live ​ and played the show's ​\" Plead the Fifth \" game in which she could only pass on one question. Jason gets straight to business with his first inquiry, \"What's the wildest place you've done the deed?\" then immediately after, \"You've played bisexual characters more than once — have you ever dipped into the lady pond in real life?\" Olivia, barely containing her embarrassment, looks baffled and her voice comes out in a nervous squeak, \"I mean, what's going on?\" she says, before finally answering, \"I appreciate all people,\" and taking a swift sip of her drink. Watch the amusing exchange below and also witness Olivia struggle to find anything about Jason that she'd change.
