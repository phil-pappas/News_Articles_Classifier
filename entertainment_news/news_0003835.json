Chris Christie.\nIn a book published this week, Snooki recalls that Christie's expression was \"full of hate\" after she introduced herself in 2013 when both were on the boardwalk in Seaside Heights. Their tense encounter was caught on video and recounted in Snooki's \"Strong is the New Sexy,\" in a passage titled \"The Governor of New Jersey Tried to Eat Me.\" Joking about the size of Christie, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, she writes that he outweighed her by \"a thousand pounds.\"\nThe two have feuded for years. Christie has disparaged the reality TV show as bad for the state's image. Snooki has called him a bully.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
