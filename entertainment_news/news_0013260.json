(Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage) ORG XMIT: 582529895 ORIG FILE ID: 491340634 (Photo: Jim Spellman, WireImage) 10 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK — Two years ago, Steven Spielberg said Hollywood was on the verge of a \"big meltdown,\" due to the film industry's increasing focus on big-budget, mass-appeal movies. \nSpeaking to students at the University of Southern California with George Lucas in June 2013, the filmmaker lamented, \"There's going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen megabudget movies are going to go crashing into the ground.\" He added , a studio \"would rather invest $250 million in one film for a real shot at the brass ring than make a whole bunch of really interesting, deeply personal — and even maybe historical — projects that may get lost in the shuffle.\" \nTalking to reporters about Cold War drama Bridge of Spies Sunday, Spielberg, 68, was asked about his thoughts on the film industry's implosion two years after his prediction. 5 things we learned about 'Bridge of Spies' \n\"To clarify, I didn't ever predict the implosion of the film industry at all,\" he said. \"I simply predicted that a number of blockbusters in one summer — those big sort of tent-pole superhero movies — there was going to come a time where two or three or four of them in a row didn't work. That's really all I said. I didn't say the film industry was ever going to end because of them.\" \nSpielberg continued by saying he felt that particular genre \"doesn't have the legs or the longevity of the Western, which was around since the beginning of film and only started to wither and shrivel in the '60s.\" Ending on a more hopeful note, he concluded that there's an audience for every kind of movie in 2015, which wasn't the case even five years ago. \n\"Now, these little movies are squeezing in and finding a birth next to these huge Queen Mary-type movies and they're able to find an audience, (or) enough of an audience to encourage the distributor and the film companies to finance more of them,\" Spielberg said. \"These are not just films like Bridge of Spies , but it's independent movies as well.\" \nConsidered one of the early pioneers of the blockbuster with franchises such as Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones , Spielberg has made an array of popcorn flicks and awards contenders throughout his career (most recently, Bridge , Lincoln and War Horse ). \nBridge had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival Sunday and opens nationwide Oct. 16. 10 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RpSBDI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:07:39.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
