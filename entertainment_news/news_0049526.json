After receiving negative feedback from the community about the former tier-based model , which added items as pre-order milestones were met, the studio has decided to go with an all-in-one plan: “all of the associated content with the program will now be made available for free to anyone who pre-orders or purchases a Day 1 edition.” One particularly contentious bonus was the ability to play the game early. This has also been changed, and now, everyone will be able to access the game on February 23. \nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided is scheduled to launch on February 23 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. \n– \n“We really understand and appreciate the passion for Deus Ex that the fans have shown here,” said David Anfossi, Studio Head at Eidos-Montréal. “Know that all of us, both at Square Enix and Eidos-Montreal, share that passion for this franchise.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:39:24.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
