The Basics, featuring Gotye (Wally de Backer). Source: Supplied \nYOU would think when the singer behind one of the biggest pop songs in recent memory performed in concert he would pack out a massive stadium and make the big bucks. \nBut Wally de Backer – better known as Gotye – will be at the Salt House in Cairns for an upcoming show with his ‘60s-inspired band The Basics. Guitarist Tim Heath explains that the trio chose to play a smaller gig at the venue for several reasons. \n“We wanted to do some smaller shows like when we started out, we were playing smaller places and wanted to recapture that,” Heath says. \n“I think you feel closer to the music and you’re much more engaged with what you do. \n“The audience have more fun and so do we, so it’s good all around.” \nPlaying together for about 13 years, the band have their own projects and spend months apart, but when they come back together it’s like nothing has changed. \n“I haven’t seen either of them in six months,” Heath said. “It all comes back pretty quickly, it’s a pretty simple formula.” \nThe Basics will be performing tracks off their latest album, The A ge of Entitlement , which they recorded at the iconic Abbey Road Studios in London. \nDuring a break in recording, Heath recalled a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \n“I walked out to have a cigarette in the garden and I could hear a warbling sound,” he said. “It was Dame Shirley Bassey and I could hear her warming up.” \nThe Basics aren’t afraid to wear their political heart on their sleeves and Heath is not intimidated by any haters who don’t like what they have to say. \n“There’s always some people who don’t agree with you and if they don’t like it they won’t buy the album or come to the show,” he said. \nCHECK The Basics perform at Salt House on October 18.
