Chairs will be moved so that audience members will have room to dance in the aisles. Hailing from the streets of Memphis and weaned on traditional gospel, Luke has been hailed by Popdose as “an uplifting, raw, soulful and timeless mini-masterpiece.”\nContinuing the series, The Bria Skonberg Quintet will appear on Thursday, November 5. “Poised to be one of the most versatile and imposing musicians of her generation,” (The Wall Street Journal), trumpeter and vocalist Skonberg is known for her ability to re-imagine classic jazz hits through a modern prism.\nBreakout Americana duo Mandolin Orange takes the stage on Thursday, February 4. Laced with bluegrass, country, and folk, their soaring original harmonies are gaining acclaim nationwide, with a refined-yet-rustic sound NPR calls “effortless and beautiful.”\nOn Thursday, March 3, D.C.’s “Best Traditional Folk Band” The Bumper Jacksons (2013 and 2014 Washington Area Music Awards) will pay homage to the musical traditions of yesteryear by taking audiences on a romp through musical genealogy, incorporating 1930s-style hot jazz, country swing, Americana hits, and big blues.\nRounding out the season on Thursday, April 7 is Maryland-born trio We're About 9. With a growing reputation for captivating vocal harmonies and impromptu humor, this group delivers an evening of brainy, acoustic songwriting that’s “well beyond the ordinary” (The Washington Post).\nNew this season, the Tivoli Discovery Series will be at the forefront of the Weinberg Center’s Shop Frederick app challenges. Launched earlier this year by the Downtown Frederick Partnership, the iOS and Android-compatible mobile app encourages loyalty among patrons of local businesses, restaurants, and event venues. Weinberg Center patrons who attend a Tivoli Discovery Series performance and check in will attend their next Tivoli Discovery Series performance for free.\nThe Tivoli Discovery Series is pay-what-you-want with a suggested donation of $10. Tickets may be reserved in advance at WeinbergCenter.org, by calling 301.600.2828, or in person at 20 West Patrick Street. Tickets will also be available at the door for each performance. A complete listing of artists and performers scheduled for the 2015-2016 season can be found at WeinbergCenter.org.\nABOUT THE WEINBERG CENTER FOR THE ARTS\nThe Weinberg Center for the Arts is one of the region’s premier performing arts presenters, offering film, music, dance, theater, and family-focused programming.
