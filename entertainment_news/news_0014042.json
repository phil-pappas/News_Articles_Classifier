Photo: Telstra\nOut of the box the Telstra TV is so simple your parents could use it without asking for your help.\nA set-top box that looks similar to an Apple TV (except with curvier edges), the user experience of the device is much like an Apple TV also, but far simpler to use, which makes it an even more enticing product for the sector of the market still adjusting to the streaming revolution.\nI would seriously consider buying a Telstra TV for my family for Christmas, if for no other reason than they'll stop messaging me about how to use their Apple TV.\nWith just two cords to plug in — HDMI and power — the set-up is simple, taking about 15 minutes. A remote with 12 buttons which utilises AAA batteries is provided, which you can use to navigate around the TV's operating system.\nPre-installed on the device are 15 apps, which include BigPond Movies, Presto, Netflix, Plus 7, SBS On Demand, 9 Jump In, YouTube, and RedBull TV. Fairfax Media and Channel Nine's streaming service Stan* also comes pre-loaded, but is not actually available yet, which is a bit of a tease. Users are met with a \"Coming soon\" page when trying to use the service.\nAdvertisement Unlike the T-Box that came before it, the Telstra TV does not support Foxtel's pay-TV service. So if you want that, Telstra recommends you buy an iQ3 set-top box ( although we recommend an iQ2 due to ongoing bugs being ironed out in the iQ3 )\nPlus 7, Nine's Jump In, YouTube, and SBS On Demand all work without the need for signing in or signing up. However, if you want your YouTube subscriptions and preferences to show up, you'll need to log-in using your Google account.\nAs part of the device's launch, Telstra is also offering a free 3-month membership to Foxtel's streaming service, Presto, and $15 to spend in the BigPond Movies store until Christmas.\nUnfortunately, even though it's \"free\" for three months, Presto still asks you to enter your credit card details for the deal to be activated, which I think is a little sneaky. You'll also need a Presto account. Thankfully, no credit card is required to redeem your BigPond Movies offer. You will, however, need to create a BigPond Movie account and set a 4 digit PIN.\nNow of course Telstra TV is meant to only be available to you if you're a Telstra fixed-line broadband customer, although we hear it's possible to use it on other broadband connections if you can get your hands on the device. But being a Telstra customer does come with some benefits: both BigPond Movies and Presto are unmetered, meaning they won't count towards your monthly data allocation.\nMeanwhile, Netflix subscribers will be happy to discover their log-in will work whether they have an Australian or US account, a handy one-up on Apple TV, which requires you to mess with your DNS settings if you have a US account.\nWhile Telstra TV claims to stream in full HD, I found it did take a while to get going. The picture started off really grainy and pixelated at first. This was then rectified within a few minutes of streaming. The quality of your broadband connection, of course, is going to depend on how good a stream you get.\nWith the Telstra TV, there's really not much else to it. It contains a really simple and easy to use interface, which will appeal to mum-and-dad users not familiar with streaming, and it's far less complicated to use than the Apple TV.\nIt becomes available Tuesday next week and sits at exactly the same price point as the Apple TV: $109.\nThings you can't do\nThe Telstra TV does not let users hack the DNS settings, which some might want to do to gain access to more content on certain services by circumventing geo-blocks. But because the device doesn't let you download extra apps, there's no real need to do this.\nThings I'd like to see\nAll TV, all in one place would be nice.\nWhile it's encouraging to see services such as SBS Catch Up and 9's Jump In on Telstra TV, if Ten Play and ABC iView became available too then all Australian catch-up services would be available in the one place - a service not currently offered by Apple TV.\nAdding Hulu to the mix wouldn't go astray either, though I imagine that would probably conflict with Presto's licensing agreement.\nThis is an exciting device for the future of Australian digital television as it enters the streaming era. I would seriously consider buying a Telstra TV for my family for Christmas, if for no other reason than they'll stop messaging me about how to use their Apple TV.\n*Stan is a joint venture of Fairfax Media, the publisher of this article, and the Nine Network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:13:18.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
