They point out that over the years Playboy carried some great features and news reports, commissioning some of the finest writers and photographers of the 20th and 21st centuries. I really can't comment. I only ever bought it for the gardening page. \nTOO much information 1) Was it absolutely necessary for the Dutch report into the MH17 disaster to reveal that some passengers in the airliner may have lived for 90 seconds? What does this questionable guesstimate add to proceedings, apart from piling yet more agony on relatives who had convinced themselves that their loved ones died instantly? \nTOO much information 2) Give some folk a hugely expensive bicycle and a smartphone and they cannot resist tweeting to all and sundry where they will be at any given time on their hugely expensive bicycles. Nothing makes life easier for a thief than to know that £5,000 worth of bike has just arrived at 23 Lobelia Avenue. Police in Dorset are advising cyclists “to be mindful” of how much information they blab into cyberspace. \nMY golden rule still applies. If you would not shout it through a megaphone from the rooftops, why on earth would you commit it to the internet? \nSO farewell, W R “Bill” Mitchell, a former editor of The Dalesman magazine who has died aged 87. His magazine, a sort of unofficial bible for Yorkshire, became the inspiration for local periodicals everywhere, including The Blackcountryman magazine. At its peak in the 1980s it sold 56,000 copies in God's Country and around the world. But as one obituary on Mitchell noted this week: “Thanks to the time-hallowed Yorkshire habits of parsimony, its readership was thought to be 25 times the number of copies sold.” Quite so. Oop North, you don't get owt fer nowt – apart from a free read of T' Dalesman. \nA READER jumps to the conclusion that my recent item, suggesting the Government would make up a £1 billion NHS shortfall by simply bunging the NHS another £1 billion, was some sort of snide attack on NHS profligacy. Not at all. The NHS is trying hard to deliver long lives to a nation of boozers, smokers and lardarses who seem hell-bent on having short lives. The biggest problems facing the NHS come not from politicians or bean-counters but from the customers. What do you think? Be the first to comment \nA DAILY Telegraph reader welcomes the prospect of leaving the EU on the grounds that “We will be able to direct farming subsidies to where they are needed most – to hill farmers and other marginal areas, including dairy farms.” Before the date of the EU referendum has even been announced, it's snouts in the trough, lads. Ask not what you can do for your nation; ask what your nation can bung into your bank account. \nA SHARP-eared, channel-hopping reader caught two forecasters' references to “perky rain showers” and “fiddly weather.” Similar meteorological oddities always welcome.
