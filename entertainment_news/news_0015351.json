The spot will offer food like Nutella cookies, homemade bagels and pancakes. \nAnd Kosan and his cohorts roast every morning in small batches and have a \"meticulously tested micro-roasting process.\" \nBut unlike other coffee shops, Walter's roasters wear HazMat suits, coffee is served in little beakers like the ones Walter White uses on the show, and the periodic table will be used as decoration. \n\"After working in the food and beverage industry all over the world for a significant amount of time, we all realized the lack of originality and agreed it is time to create a social space with an edge,\" their Facebook page says. \"We are passionate about coffee and we love Breaking Bad, the greatest TV-Show of all time. So we wanted to combine our common interests.\" \nIf all goes well, Walter's will open a \"coffee lab\" in Greenpoint in April 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:57:53.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
