Kung papipiliin po ako, ’yung isa banana (ang tinda) and ’pag nakaipon pa po ako (ay) bakery (naman),” said she, who counts red velvet and black forest cakes among her specialties.\nElha is not stopping at being a baker as she wants to be a scientist, too. “Gusto ko po magtrabaho sa NASA,” she said.\nOn that note, we asked her if there’s a science to winning singing competitions and she said, “Kailangan pong huminga ng malalim para po hindi masira ’yung vocal cords niyo. Kung ano lang po talaga ’yung kanta ko, tututukan ko po ’yun. Kasi once na tinutukan niyo po ’yung songs nila, baka magkamali po kayo sa mga lyrics, baka iba po ’yung makanta niyo.”\nElha has been busy touring different provinces like Cabanatuan, Pampanga and Naga as the new “The Voice Kids” grand champion. She is scheduled to visit Roxas, Capiz and Davao in the coming months.\nBecause of her schedule, the grade six student is now playing catch-up in school.\n“Nag-e-exam po ako ’pag may time. Ina-update po ako ng mga classmates ko by (Facebook) Messenger, pini-picture-an po nila (’yung lessons),” she said.\nGiven a chance, she would also like to venture into acting.\nElha was supposed to portray her life story on “Maalaala Mo Kaya” but since she cannot cry on cue, “Going Bulilit” star Brenna Garcia got the part.\n“The Voice Kids 2” Top 6 contenders has released a compilation album under MCA Music that contains songs they performed during the two-week finals of the reality talent search like “Flashlight,” “If I Were A Boy,” “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” and “Ikaw Ang Lahat Sa Akin.” The other contenders featured in the album are Reynan Dal-Anay, Esang de Torres, Sassa Dagdag, Zephanie Dimaranan, and Kyle Echarri.\nIn line with the release of their album is a mall tour that includes stops at SM Sangandaan today, SM Angono on Oct. 25 and SM Molino on Oct. 30.
