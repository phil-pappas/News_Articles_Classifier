However, he is a romantic at heart and shares with us his love for the Taj Mahal and how he wishes to pay a tribute to the monument's beauty with one of his songs.\nListen to songs of Kunal Ganjawala on Gaana.com\nI don't like my songs\nHe says, \"I don't particularly like my songs. I don't listen to them after recording. I let the audience decide. But I love listening to all the legends we have had in our music industry as each of them was ahead of their time. It's not like they composed music that ended with their time. It's still very relevant... it's timeless. RD Burman is my all-time favourite, but I can't decide which song of his I like the most. It would be like deciding which boss you like the most among your many bosses.\"\nI want to make a music video with the Taj Mahal in the backdrop\nMany Bollywood songs have been shot at the Taj Mahal and Kunal too plans to do something similar. He says, \"I would love to shoot a song with the Taj Mahal in the backdrop, but I will do that only when I have a song worthy of it. I don't want to do it for the heck of it. I want my song to do justice to the beauty of the monument and so, it has to be something special. I want to express my unconditional love for the Taj.\" The singer says he is excited about turning music composer. \"I am composing music for a couple of films and I am excited about switching to music direction. I am also working on a couple of singles.\"\nU.P. mein perform karne ki ek alag feel hai\nKunal has performed in many cities across the country but he thinks that his concerts in UP cities stand out. He says, \"I have had a few shows in UP and the audience here is great. UP mein perform karne ki ek alag feel hai jaise kisi performance ko tadka lagaya ho .\" Talking about his visits to the state, he says, \"I am very vocal about things I feel. I was recently passing through the Yamuna Expressway (Noida to Agra) and I realized how beautiful it is. I have obviously crossed it more than ten times, but this time, the whole experience felt different. I felt a sense of belonging to UP. There is so much to see and explore here.\"\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Arijit has shown Pak singers the way out Kunal Ganjawala - TOI\nHoliday Amazon.in : INR 166.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.in/Holiday-Arijit-Singh/dp/B00KMUCSYO%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00KMUCSYO", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://gaana.com/artist/kunal-ganjawala", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UAKn5LbIfo", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ennf5%2BAlL._SL160_.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:28:06.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
