Woodell was the brunette of a group of three sisters whose romantic lives were a key part of the series. \nShe left the series after two years because she wanted to return to singing, McDade said. She toured as part of comic Jack Benny’s show and acted in a handful of movies including “Twilight People” and “The Big Doll House.” \nWoodell left acting in the mid 1970s.
