But even disappointing players can rebound with the right matchup. STUDS\nRB Eddie Lacy, Green Bay Packers: Lacy has been sharing the workload with James Starks in recent weeks, but the Packers should feed Lacy more against a San Deigo Chargers defense that’s the second-best fantasy matchup for running backs (33.2 PPR points per game), but has defended the pass well. Look for Green Bay to feature the ground game this week.\nWR Demaryius Thomas, Denver Broncos: Peyton Manning’s difficulties — in picking up Gary Kubiak’s offense and staving off age — have brought Denver's passing game down a notch. Still, Thomas has yet to garner fewer than eight targets in a game this year. The Cleveland Browns’ hobbled and erratic secondary will help the Broncos turn back the clock.\nWR Brandon Marshall, New York Jets: This Washington Redskins secondary has had trouble with competent passing games. The Jets, shockingly, can be considered one, thanks to QB Ryan Fitzpatrick. Marshall ranks in the top 20 in fantasy targets (44) and is fifth in fantasy points per game (22.0 PPR) among wideouts.\nWR Mike Wallace, Minnesota Vikings: The Kansas City Chiefs have allowed the most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Charles Johnson might come off the sidelines, but Wallace proved during Johnson’s absence (eight catches, 83 yards, TD in Week 4) that he can connect with QB Teddy Bridgewater. Perhaps this could be a gutsy daily fantasy stack.\nQB Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals: A blowout win held Palmer to 161 passing yards last week, but he was efficient with three touchdowns on just 11 completions. The Pittsburgh Steelers have stopped the interior run game effectively for most of the year, so Palmer should rely on his Larry Fitzgerald-led wideouts and his reception-friendly running backs.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 6 fantasy football rankings\nDUDS\nWR Antonio Brown, Pittsburgh Steelers: Brown has averaged four catches and 43.5 receiving yards in the two games Michael Vick has replaced Ben Roethlisberger. Brown likely will have to deal with an annoying shadow in Patrick Peterson. Brown can’t be considered more than a low-end fantasy WR2. Avoid him in daily games.\nRB Frank Gore, Indianapolis Colts: Since Week 1, the New England Patriots have been one of the strongest defenses against running backs. Indy is going to have to pass often against the Pats, which will probably keep Gore off the field more frequently than his owners would like. Gore could be a low-end second back if you’re roster-strapped, but the game flow probably won’t help.\nWR Pierre Garcon, Washington Redskins: Welcome to Revis Island, Pierre. QB Kirk Cousins will also have to stare down the New York Jets' defensive front, which has Sheldon Richardson back. However, the Jets have allowed secondary receivers to beat them, so this looks like a Jamison Crowder — perhaps DeSean Jackson? — week.\nRB Chris Ivory, New York Jets: The Redskins have allowed one back to accrue at least 100 offensive yards. (Devonta Freeman last week.) In traditional games, Ivory is worth starting for volume. In daily? His return on investment will disappoint.\nRB Chris Johnson, Arizona Cardinals: Johnson continues to churn out RB1-style fantasy numbers, most recently 103 yards on 11 carries in Week 5. The Cards probably won’t have room to run against Pittsburgh, so they'll probably rely on receiving backs David Johnson and Andre Ellington.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nFantasyScore podcast Week 6: Jamaal Charles fill-ins, quarterback chaos, more\nSLEEPERS\nQB Teddy Bridgewater, Minnesota Vikings: With 269 passing yards and a score, Bridgewater tied his best fantasy game of the year in Week 4. Coming off a bye, he should regain momentum. K.C. has been the best fantasy matchup for quarterbacks, allowing 26.4 fantasy points per game.\nRB C.J. Spiller, New Orleans Saints: While his snap count took a dive in Week 5, Spiller should get his fix in Week 6. The Falcons allow the most fantasy points (PPR) per game to this position, which includes the most total receptions (49, almost 10 per contest). Mark Ingram has embraced his receiving game, sure, but few reserves will look as alluring as Spiller with some big backs on bye.\nWR Torrey Smith, San Francisco 49ers: Revenge game! Smith’s former teammates come to town. His new slinger, Colin Kaepernick, comes off a much-needed rebound effort in time for the Baltimore Ravens, who’ve allowed the second-most PPR points per game to wideouts.\nTE Zach Ertz, Philadelphia Eagles: Ertz has 27 targets compared to Brent Celek’s six, but Celek has both touchdowns for this Philly position. Ertz should hurt the Giants, the second most favorable statistical matchup for TE (20.4 PPR PPG). They’ve yielded big games to Jason Witten, Jordan Reed and Charles Clay … while letting Garrett Celek (!) hit the end zone. His brother’s teammate should give Philly and fantasy owners a big day.\nWR Marvin Jones, Cincinnati Bengals: Jones earned eight targets in two of his last three games and has two touchdowns this season. The Buffalo Bills rank sixth in PPR points per game allowed to wide receivers. They’ll probably have most of their resources devoted to containing A.J. Green, which should leave Jones in some one-on-one situations. He wins many of those.\nUSA TODAY\nWeek 6 fantasy football tips", "external_links": ["http://fantasy.usatoday.com/2015/10/week-6-fantasy-football-rankings-demarco-murray-julian-edelman", "http://fantasy.usatoday.com/2015/10/fantasyscore-podcast-jamaal-charles-quarterbacks", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/fantasy/2015/10/14/week-6-fantasy-football-tips/73960496/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/fspodcast-site-hero660x4501.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e673712645aef447d5d5dbff941b4fb26d610433/c=61-0-661-600/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804497736778458-matchupsWk6a.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47800c1eb37096318449e2ea7743a2c2e109a3b6/r=300/https/i2.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/demarco-murray-philadelphia-eagles_101115-e1444747992726.jpg?fit=440%2C330"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:35:32.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
