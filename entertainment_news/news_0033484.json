According to reports, Scott Disick entered a rehab facility in Malibu last weekend , in an attempt to overcome his penchant to abuse alcohol. \n\nThe news came hours after Khloe's estranged husband Lamar was found unconscious at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada on Tuesday, but it's likely that Scott doesn't even know that he's fighting for his life in the hospital right now. \nAccording to PEOPLE magazine, \"They don't want it to interfere with his progress.\" \nThe 32-year-old reportedly entered the treatment facility after an ultimatum from his long-time love Kourtney Kardashian, who allegedly threatened that he couldn't have unsupervised visitation with their three children until he cleaned himself up. \nThe couple broke up in July after nine years together, and they share Mason, 5, Penelope, 3, and Reign, 10 months. Scott seemed to spiral out of control a few years ago after dealing with losing his parents right on top of each other, and apparently the stress of adding a third kid into the mix was just too much. \nMore from The Stir : Khloe Kardashian & Lamar Odom Are Technically Still Married \nScott's attempted rehab before, but hopefully now with his relationship with his kids on the line, he'll actually be willing to go through it rather than check himself out to go partying again. And even if he doesn't know about Lamar yet, if he tries to check out, maybe someone should tell him. It might be the wake-up call he needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:50:49.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
