But you are not hallucinating.\nThose really are singing nuns in front of you.\nOr at least they will be, when \"Nunsense\" opens in Kahunaville's dinner show space (also home to the \"Island Heat\" revue) on Nov. 2, to run in a 4 p.m. afternoon slot.\nThe cabaret musical that became a $500 million-and-counting cottage industry will return with the same producer, Jay Harvey, and many of the cast members who were involved in a solid run at the former Las Vegas Hilton from 2010 through 2013.\nDan Goggin, the show's original creator, is in town to oversee the new production hands-on. Though he did the same for the Hilton version, it's a rare commitment, as the show can be licensed in more than 150 places worldwide in a given year.\nLocal alumni who are again donning the habits include Anita Bean, Kathryn Arianoff, Robin Vincent, Janien Valentine, Deidre Thompson, Amanda Kaiser, Dolly Coulter and Margaret Gonzalez.\nIf you've never seen \"Nunsense\" or one of its five spin-off productions, it concerns some singing nuns forced to put on a fundraiser to bury four late members of their order, who are on ice back at the convent after eating some bad mushrooms.\nRead more from Mike Weatherford at reviewjournal.com.
