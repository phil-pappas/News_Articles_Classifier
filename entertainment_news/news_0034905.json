Ritesh Kumar, all of 31, is one among Bengaluru's youngest producers to present his first Kannada feature film — + (Plus) — this week, making him quite the eligible bachelor in town.\nAhead of the release, Ritesh tells us, \"Plus is an unconventional commercial film — one that follows the dos of a commercial venture, even though the subject is unconventional. I quit my job as an engineer over a year ago to work on this film and I found it easier to put together my own resources to take up the gamble and turn producer than put in the effort to convince a seasoned one.\" The unconventionality comes across on various levels. The most obvious one being the choice and presentation of the lead actor — Ananth Nag.\n\"I had a basic cast in mind while I was writing Plus. And the lead role was specifically written for Ananth Nag. There is no other actor of that age here who can look both sophisticated and classy and fit as well. He is perfect. There were a few other main characters too that I had in mind. When director Gadda Vijji came on board, he approached them with each of the roles and everything fell into place,\" explains Ritesh.\nThe other aspect has to do with the personalities of each of the other lead characters. \"The script addresses disorders that are less spoken off. For instance, Chetan Chandra's character suffers what is called misophonia, which is hardly ever spoken about, at least onscreen. There's also newcomer Shalini who suffers from hemophobia, and I play a guy who is a narcissist. While it refrains from getting preachy, it is an entertaining journey that transforms negativity into positivity,\" says the writer-actor, who adds, \"I feel that in addition to the freshness of the subject, its originality is something that will strike a chord with the audience.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:05:20.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
