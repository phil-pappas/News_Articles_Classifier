Just Click the Like Button Below Rating: 2.0 /5 \nRam scored a decent hit with his previous offering Pandaga Chesko but has attained much criticism for delivering mere pot-boilers again and again. Check out the review of Shivam to know if he has changed his path. Shivam (Telugu) (U/A): Book Your Tickets Right Away! Shivam Story: \nShiva (Ram) is this guy, who does anything for the sake of love and believes in love marriages, even it has to do with going against the will of parents. On that note, he finds his love of life in Tanu (Raashi Khanna) and follows to her village and that's where the supposed to be twist arises in the tale and Shiva gets in to a trouble with Bhoji Reddy (Vineet Kumar) and Abhi (Abhimanyu Singh). \nWhat is the issue between the baddies and our hero? How did he untie the locks and comes out of the problems? This forms the rest of the story. Performances: \nRam has maintained his energies through out as usual though he did not get to do anything extra ordinary in the film. His dances, dialogues, gestures everything felt like seen and done and we only had to blame the outdated stuff that the script offered him. \nRashi Khanna did not leave any impression with her performance though she looked bubbly and cute. Brahmanandam felt painful probably for the first time and everybody else has just done their job. Technical Aspects: \nDevi Sri Prasad has tried his best to bring the film alive though the director has already killed it in the stage of scripting itself. However, even the music director appears to have lost any interest during the re-recording of the film. \nDirector Srinivas Reddy offered an age old routine drama by trying to fill up the loop holes with those cranky comedy bits, prolonging everything to the extremities. The film tests your patience with every moment and takes forever to end. It's high time Telugu film makers realize even the tastiest of the food starts to feel acerbic after a while. Cinematography and production values were okay. Overview: \nWe are no one to stop you from watching Shivam . Given that, do not blame us for not stopping you from spoiling your long weekend.
