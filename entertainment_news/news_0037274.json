He was 71.\nThe composer, a competent singer too, groomed a bunch of talented singers as well: Yesudas, Hemlata and Jaspal Singh.\nJain, born in Aligarh, burst into public consciousness with the romantically rebellious track, Le Jayenge le jayenge dilwale dulhania le jayenge (film: Chor Machaye Shor) that wedding bands play to this day. In a Facebook post, Jain had revealed that only after playing 30 tunes to the film's director and producer, his last attempt eventually struck a chord.\nAnother song from the same film, Ghunghoo ki tarah bajta hi raha hoon main, underlined his potential as a songwriter, noticed by the Rajshris with whom he collaborated on over a dozen of vegetarian family dramas: Chitchor, Geet Gaata Chal, Saudagar. These films, devoid of the famous Bollywood villain, romanced a certain kind of innocent India which Jain's tunes adroitly captured. The title song of Ankhiyon Ke Jharokhe Se topped the Binaca Geet Mala annual countdown charts in 1978. Fittingly, Jain's last major hit, Vivah (2006) came for the same house.\nJain started his career composing songs for All India Radio in Kolkata. His first release, Kaanch aur Heera (1972) didn't give any advance warning of the popularity that the Sanskrit scholar's son would soon attain.\nThough visual impairment forced him to stop studies after Class V, Jain never stopped learning. His website says that the composer knew multiple languages, including Sanskrit, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Arabic. He also composed music for films in languages other than Hindi, including Bengali and Bhojpuri.\nJain also collaborated with director B R Chopra in several films, including the unlikely Pati, Patni aur Woh, which had the funny and freezing number, Thande thande paani se nahana chahiye.Jain's compositions for Raj Kapoor's Ram Teri Ganga Maili, became another feather in his cap. Sun sahiba sun was the No 1 song in 1985 for Binaca Geet Mala. And his chaupais for the tv serial Ramayan were huge favorites during festivals.\nMany renowned personalities, from Bollywood and outside, have condoled his passing away on social media. Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on Twitter: Shri Ravindra Jain will be remembered for his versatile music & fighting spirit. Pained on his demise. Condolences to his family & admirers.\nLata Mangeshkar, who sang so many superhits for him, tweeted,\"Bahut dukh ki khabar abhi aayi hai, mahan sangeetkar, kavi, gayak Ravindra Jain ji ka aaj swargwas hua hai.Ishwar unki aatma ko shanti de.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:31:39.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
