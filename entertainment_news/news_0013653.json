(Photo for the Tribune by Alex Garcia) He was Bunky to the wealthy women he escorted around town. He was Bunky to the guests at his popular fundraisers and at his annual St. Valentine's Day tea where guests were commanded to wear red.\nAt the Ralph Lauren store on North Michigan Avenue, where he sold shirts and ties but created a persona that went far beyond salesman, his influence was celebrated on the restaurant's menu with a regular item called \"Bunky's cookies.\"\n\"I've never met anyone like him,\" Dori Wilson, a Chicago publicist, said Thursday. \"I've never heard of anyone like him.\"\nWilson was among several friends who went to see Cushing on Tuesday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, as he'd hoped. But there was no party. Sometime Monday night, shortly after his triple bypass surgery, something went wrong.\nSchmich: Valentine's Tea Served With Cream Of Chicago Society Open link By Tuesday morning, Cushing, 65, was on life support. A chaplain who arrived to administer the last rites invited his friends into the room. They laid their hands on him and said goodbye, stunned but glad that he wasn't alone.\nThere truly was no one like Bunky Cushing in Chicago.\nYears ago, I covered one of his Valentine's Day parties at the Ritz-Carlton, a Bunky love-in filled with women in red leather and red mink, carrying red Escada handbags and wearing red stiletto heels.\n\"You know you've made it when Bunky puts you on his list,\" one woman said.\n\"Bunky,\" another said, \"is the only person who could get me to wear red.\"\nBunky Cushing's Big Night: He's neither famous nor wealthy. So how did he become a confidant of Chicago's society elite and host of one of the biggest bashes of the year? Open link Cushing was one of those people often referred to as self-invented. He liked to tell the story of how he arrived in Chicago in 1990 knowing only one person, the Ralph Lauren rep.\nEven friends who knew him for a long time didn't know much about his past, and he often suggested that though he had relations with money he came from the poor branch of the family.\n\"I have to work,\" he was known to say.\nHe cracked that the 146 bus he took to the Ralph Lauren store was his chauffeur-driven navy blue Range Rover.\nAccording to his sister, Cathy Clisham, he came from a \"comfortable\" family in Michigan, the only boy sandwiched between four girls.\n\"I think Bunky liked to work more than he needed to work,\" she said. \"I think that he loved being around people.\"\nFrom the beginning of his Chicago life, Cushing was daringly old-fashioned.\nA balding man with a cherubic face and a ready smile, he believed in manners, in pulling out a woman's chair at the dinner table and standing when she left.\nHe handwrote all the invitations to his parties, sent handwritten birthday cards to countless friends and wrote his mother, who's 96, once a week.\nWomen, especially, appreciated his gentlemanly ways, his humor and his kindness, all of which made him a desirable escort, known in certain circles as a \"walker.\"\n\"He was a very sought-after walker and not just to the older, well-preserved women, but to younger women like myself,\" says one of his friends. \"If I didn't have a date, he was my go-to guy. He was an incredible keeper of confidences. He earned your trust. He earned his reputation on that.\"\nCushing had some gay male friends, but mostly he enjoyed the company of women, old and young, married, never married, widowed, divorced.\n\"He loved his ladies,\" said Hazel Barr, one of his closest friends.\nHis ladies, as he once said in an interview, \"don't care that I'm not 6 feet tall with blue eyes.\"\nAnd Cushing rallied his ladies for good causes. They helped him raise big money for Howard Brown Health Center and the Jane Addams Senior Caucus.\nBarr once asked him why he was interested in the Jane Addams caucus. He liked their work, he said, but there was something more: A woman had written him a letter asking him to help out.\n\"I like people who write handwritten letters,\" he told Barr.\nCushing sometimes raised an eyebrow at the milieu he occupied. Recently, on his blog, bunkycushing.com, he posted a piece about \"ladies who lunch.\"\n\"Blonde hair is de rigueur,\" he wrote, \"coiffed and spun into a monsoon-proof sugar-coated helmet. Jewelry is understated and correct. Diamonds may be a girl's best friend, but not at lunch.\"\nA few days ago, Cushing felt ill at work. A colleague took him to the hospital. He'd had a heart attack, apparently not his first. He was told to come back for bypass surgery.\nAnd then he was gone.\n\"Everybody's in shock,\" Dori Wilson said, \"and full of love.\"\nI can still see him at that St. Valentine's Day tea, looking out over the flock of red-clad women he called his swans, flushed with pride.\n\"I've loved parties since I was a little boy,\" he said. \"I like to stand back and watch. It makes me feel like Gatsby.\"\nmschmich@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MarySchmich\n Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-531ac74a/turbine/chi-ccserviceclub0320120807084156-thumbnail", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56206d7d/turbine/ct-bunky-cushing-mary-schmich-1016-met-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-502136d0/turbine/chi-ccserviceclub0320120807084156"], "published": "2015-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:30:05.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
