But the tweet had a complicated backstory: Diane's been married to Kate's dad, Frederic \"Bill\" Hoit, for 34 years. He's spent the last 10 living in a nursing home, ever since he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. \nOn Saturday morning, with Kate ready to snap a selfie of the front page of the Times Union that featured their story, Diane said, \"Oh my God, Katie. O , God.\" \nIt's been a little overwhelming. But Diane's social calendar will be filling up, even if it isn't with handsome suitors. Yet. \nCosmopolitan magazine picked the story up on its website. The story ran on newspaper websites in Houston, San Francisco, San Antonio and England. Dr. Phil's people called (that may happen next week). Then producers from an Australian morning talk show, similar to the \"Today\" show, reached out. (That may happen, too.) \nOne daughter put forth her dad, who just relocated to the area, is in his 80s and loves to dance, just like Diane. \nThe Gmail account they set up for potential dates to email them — datedianeALB@gmail.com — is up to a little over a dozen emails, including some from women, some who know what it's like to love someone with the disease, offering to go out for coffee and chat. \nIt's the thing Diane never did after Bill was diagnosed — find a support group. She just goes to her job in the guidance department at the Schenectady City School District every day, and keeps lists of things to tell Kate the next time they talk. Sometimes, she goes to dinner with her best girlfriend, the one who saved her from the brink in those months after Bill went into the nursing home. \nAnd now, pushed into a little vulnerability by her only child, the social media-savvy Kate, a community is starting to form around Diane. Millennials who see the story on Twitter are asking their parents who they know. Friends of Kate's are saying they're happy to take Diane to an Albany Devils game, something she loves but hasn't done since she \"lost\" Bill in almost every way that counts. \nOn Saturday, they went to the nursing home for a few hours. It wasn't a good visit. Bill ate the Boston cream doughnuts they brought him, a favorite, and spent most of the time sleeping. He thought Kate was his sister and didn't know her name. They're going again on Monday, before Kate heads back to Virginia. \nDiane says she intends to go dancing on Thursday. She has appreciated all the responses, even if it's a little overwhelming. \nPeople seem to understand. \n\"It's nice because you do feel like you're alone. You're in limbo,\" she says. \"That's what you feel like.\" \nSo, ideally, if there's a fella out there between the ages of 60 and 70, know Kate and Diane are still looking. Kate continues to tweet pictures of Diane — using apple cider doughnuts as eyeglasses, out to dinner with Kate's girlfriends, dressed up for a friend's wedding. Looking fantastic with all that life behind those bright blue eyes. \n#DateDiane is still hunting. But now she knows she's not alone.
