Cycle 3 winner Eva Pigford took on the stage name of Eva Marcille and has found regular work as an actor.\nThe highest-rated show on the CW as recently as 2010, “ANTM” has seen its ratings slide sharply of late. A recent episode drew just 1 million live viewers. The series finale is slated for Dec. 4.\n“America’s Next Top Model” airs at 8 p.m. Friday on the CW.\n“The Voice” 8 tonight and 9 p.m. Tuesday, NBC It's the battle rounds over the next two nights, with the knockouts beginning next week. Last week’s episodes provided some surprises. Manny Cabo and Krista Hughes, both of whom got all four judges to turn around in their blind auditions, lost their battles and were not stolen.\n“Survivor: Cambodia – Second Chances” 8 p.m. Wednesday, CBS Life got a little better for the Angkor tribe last week, as it won a food reward, and then got worse again as the tribe lost its second straight immunity challenge. Jeff Varner, who had first played in 2001 in “The Australian Outback” season, went home.\n“Project Runway” 9 p.m. Thursday, Lifetime Kelly Dempsey continued to overturn our expectations by winning her second straight challenge. The contest called for the designers to use a 3D printer to design a piece inspired by New York’s bridges. Less surprising was the elimination of Merline Labissiere, who was good enough to last until late in the contest but never seemed like a real contender.\n“The Amazing Race” 8 p.m. Friday, CBS Last week’s episode promised a lot of drama but didn’t deliver much, as everyone passed on U-turning an opponent, and the episode ended with only two teams checked in at the Pit Stop. Friday’s episode will continue in Zimbabwe.\n“Dancing With the Stars” 8 tonight, ABC Leah Remini is due to take over as co-host for Erin Andrews in tonight’s episode. Remini will continue in the role for a couple more weeks while Andrews covers postseason baseball for Fox. Remini, who competed on the show in Season 17, sat in for Andrews last year as well.\nDuring last week’s partner switch-up, no couple was eliminated. Scores from that night carriy over to tonight.\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:02:26.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
