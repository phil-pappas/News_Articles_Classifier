Comment Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 9:08 AM Updated at 12:05 PM Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 9:08 AM Updated at 12:05 PM Â» Social News Donald Trump participated in a Today show town hall Monday morning, fielding questions from voters and addressing such topics as gun control, his presidential rivals, and ... his hair. Trump said his mop - and whether or not it's all natural - is the biggest misconception about him in the eyes of the public. \"May not be pretty, but it's mine,\" he said. Trump is the second presidential candidate to participate in a town hall forum with Today , behind Hillary Clinton 's earlier this month . Here are five other highlights from Trump's town hall: On the Syrian refugee crisis: Trump slammed President Obama's proposal to allow 250,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S., saying the influx could be \"the greatest Trojan horse of all time\" and may result in ISIS terrorists sneaking into the country. How to run for president, according to Donald Trump On his weaknesses: The Republican frontrunner says he has weaknesses, but didn't want to cite specifics because then \"I'd expose the weaknesses to Putin and then everybody else and we don't want to do that, right? ... I don't like exposing them because if I expose them then the enemy knows.\" On his humble beginnings: Trump said he got his start in business thanks to a \"small loan of a million dollars\" from his father. On his plan for the military: Trump's biggest foreign policy priority is to \"knock the hell out of ISIS\" and, if elected, he vowed to build a military \"so strong, so powerful, so everything\" that the U.S. would no longer have to worry about challenges from other countries. On gun control: Trump pledged that, as president, he would veto any legislation that would provide for restrictions on access to guns. The country already has \"tremendous regulations\" on guns and doesn't need any more, he said.
