Selleck reveals his indirect path to success in Hollywood , and how he stays grounded by living out of the spotlight on his working ranch in California . He also talks about how he shaped his character on Magnum P.I. to become the first role to portray a Vietnam Veteran in a positive way.\nA Day in the Life of The American Caregiver : AARP The Magazine's photo essay highlights the lives of eight caregivers assisting adult children, brothers and sisters, parents, friends and neighbors who are ill or disabled. In the photo essay, readers will meet caregivers who are providing ongoing care for loved ones facing Alzheimer's, arthritis, cancer, catastrophic accidents, dementia, Down syndrome, stroke, war injuries and other health crises. The total value of this home care, if someone was hired to perform it, would total nearly $470 billion nationally, which is more than the total Medicaid spending in 2013 ( $449 billion ). Yet all of these caregivers are part of the 17 percent of the U.S. population (about 40 million Americans) who care for an adult on an unpaid basis, often while facing a steep caregiving learning curve and holding down full-time jobs. AARP offers many resources for both new and experienced caregivers alike at www.aarp.org/caregiving .\nMore on Caregiving : On October 15 , AARP is launching the Random Acts of Kindness for Caregivers contest. Caregivers need plenty of support to keep doing the important work of caring for relatives, friends and neighbors. AARP hopes that by encouraging people to show family caregivers small signs of support, these caregivers-many of them overwhelmed-will be freed up to spend more time with loved ones they care for, or even just to spend some downtime relaxing and rejuvenating. Show caregivers your support by engaging in a Random Act of Kindness today. For some suggestions about helpful acts of kindness, and also to submit your good deeds and ideas, go to www.aarp.org/caregiverkindness\nHealth : Learn about some of the most threatening health conditions to people 50-plus as they age -cancer, heart disease, diabetes and obesity-as well as tips that are specific to both men's and women's health. Covering everything from better food choices, ways to increase physical activity and symptoms that could indicate a serious health condition, these 50 tips are easy to follow and incorporate into your daily routine.
