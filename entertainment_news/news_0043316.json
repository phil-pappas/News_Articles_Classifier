NBC also was inspired by a New York magazine cover story this summer that gathered many of Cosby's accusers together for a photograph, although Snow said the network had begun working to gather the interviews before that. \nSnow said all of the women who have publicly accused Cosby were asked to participate in the interview, which was recorded in Los Angeles in late August. Twenty-seven women agreed. Snow said she interviewed four other women involved anonymously in a 2005 case against Cosby, and two of them subsequently said they would join the other women on camera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:40:58.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
