It was his first performance after making a brief appearance at the Emmy Awards in September.\nThe comedian tweeted a photo of himself on stage, and his 30 Rock co-star Judah Friedlander, who was there to support him, tweeted a picture of the pair, saying \"T Money is back \"\nThe former Saturday Night Live star suffered life-threatening injuries after his car was involved in a multi-vehicle accident in June 2014 when a Wal-Mart ruck crashed into the back of a limo carrying Morgan and his friends - including his childhood friend James McNair, who was killed. Morgan suffered serious brain trauma as well as a broken leg, ribs and nose.\nAdvertisement But after more than a year of rehabilitation, Morgan's triumphant first comedy set was reportedly a return to form after his sombre, if touching, speech at the Emmys, where he thanked his co-stars and supporters for their encouragement, saying he'd missed his friends.\n\"Thanks to my amazing doctors, and the support of my family and beautiful wife, I'm here. Standing on my own two feet,\" he said before receiving a standing ovation.\nMorgan was reportedly back on form, making jokes about his speech therapy and other gags about his post-accident recovery.\nHis surprise stand-up shows came ahead of the star's return to Saturday Night Live , where he'll appear as a guest this weekend, alongside Demi Lovato.\nMy first time on stage in 16 Months at the #ComedyCellar !
