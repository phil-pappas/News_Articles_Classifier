Taylor Swift needs a break from being Taylor Swift October 9, 2015 5:38am Email a friend \nEVEN Taylor Swift knows there’s such a thing as too much. \nThe pop star, coming off a year in which her album 1989 dominated the charts, told NME magazine that it might be time for a vacation. \n“I think I should take some time off,” the 25-year-old told the magazine. \n“I think people might need a break from me. I’m going to … I don’t know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don’t know.” Taylor Swift spoke to UK magazine NME. Picture: Jordan Hughes/NME Source: Supplied \nThough she’s thoroughly enjoyed seeing all her hard work pay off (and earning her an unexpected Emmy to boot), the increased time in the spotlight, even by her standards, comes with its own set of drawbacks. \n“I’m in the news every single day for multiple different reasons,” she told the magazine. \n“And it can feel, at times, if you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody’s waiting for you to really mess up — and then you’ll be done.” Having the time of her life. Picture: Jordan Hughes/NME Source: Supplied \nFortunately for Swift, while she may now be the biggest music star in the world, she is still surrounded by people who keep her grounded and connected to who she really is. \n“A lot of the time I need to call my mum and talk for a really long time, just to remind myself of all the things that are great and all the things that matter,” she said. \n“If you do something that defines your character to be not what the public thought you were, that’s the biggest risk.” \nWhether or not she does take some much-needed downtime, there’s one thing Swift knows she won’t attempt in the near future: to surpass the critical and popular bar she set with 1989. \n“N ,” she said. \n“How could the next one be as big? Maybe the next album will be a bridge to somewhere else. Or maybe I’ll just go ahead and change everything.” Perhaps she’s after more time with boyfriend Calvin Harris?
