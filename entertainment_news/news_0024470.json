But this time in Bollywood with 'Yaara Silly Sillyâ€™', I'm extremely confident that even the Hindi film industry will look up to her as a talented actor,\" Sehgal told IANS.\n\"There have been several good female-oriented performances on display this year, but I feel that Paoli's act will stand out and be counted despite our film being smaller. I think she is one of the strong contenders for National Award this year,\" he added.\nPaoli plays the role of a sex worker in the film and is paired with actor Parambrata Chatterjee, with whom she has worked in several Bengali films. The chemistry between them is said to be captured beautifully in a subtle, hilarious yet intense manner.\n\"Since Paoli is playing the role of a prostitute in my film, audience may expect some sizzling scenes. But I assure you that there is no vulgarity, nudity or skin show in the film, with performances shining through. Parambrata too has given a stunning performance, complementing Paoli in an understated manner,\" he added.\n'Yaara Silly Silly' is jointly produced by Reena Bhushan Suri and Neena Subhash Sehgal under the banner Movee Dreems. The film is slated to release on November 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:02:00.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
