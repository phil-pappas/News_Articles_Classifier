I love the change of the seasons, vibrant leaves rustling all around me. Perhaps I want to hold onto crisp, fall weather as long as possible, well past the day those first few flakes fly through the air. Over the years, I've hiked through several stunning parks I consider hidden gems in the Rochester region. Sure, I love a good walk through Mendon Ponds Park and along the numerous trails in Braddock Bay, but there's something special about heading into a serene section of woods, alone with your thoughts or your hiking companion.\nWalking off the beaten path, you feel a bit like an explorer navigating trails and waters. Sure, others have been here. You likely have a printed map in hand to find your way through the woods. But these lesser-known, sparsely-populated parks offer natural beauty at its finest, and with little interruption from others.\nPlanning to hike this month? Here are a few of my favorite hidden hiking gems in and around Monroe County:\n​ Corbett's Glen Nature Park: This 52-acre town park off Penfield Road in Brighton is among my favorite community parks in the county. Tucked between several neighborhoods and a railroad line, Corbett's Glen is just west of the Brighton-Penfield border and is home to two miles of trails in an otherwise bustling area.\nBuy Photo Postcard Falls in Corbett's Glen in Brighton Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nThe park is accessible from Penfield Road, where there's a small parking lot, and from Glen Road, a short residential road off Route 441, just east of Interstate 490.\nIn the southern end of the park, visitors walk through a stone archway tunnel alongside Allens Creek. Here, they will immediately see a series of waterfalls cascade over pebbles and stones in the creekbed. In summer months, many hikers wade into the clear water and picnic by the creek. The southern loop takes visitors past the falls, through a meadow and across several boardwalks in the Allens Creek Valley wetlands. The northern end of the park offers two looping wooded trails among mature trees.\nBuy Photo Fall colors are slowly starting to appear in Corbett's Glen in Brighton Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nOnce a privately-owned park and a former camp, the Town of Brighton and the Genesee Land Trust preserved the land, converting the southern parcel into a town park in 1999. The northern wooded parcel was acquired several years later.\nThe park is popular with trail runners and young families. When facing a time crunch, many hikers head straight to the falls. I prefer to work for my view, so I typically park at (or run to) the northern end of the park and make my way to the southern loop (and waterfalls) and back.\nWhiting Road Nature Preserve: This wooded area in Webster boasts 3.5 miles of multi-use trails. Runners, walkers, hikers and mountain bikers are often found on the park's five dirt and grass trails on 240 acres of town-owned land. Whiting Road Nature Preserve , at 403 Whiting Road, is one of my favorite hiking spots in Monroe County, in part because of the variety of all you encounter in the park. Non-motorized vehicles (including all-terrain vehicles, dirt bikes and snowmobiles) are not allowed within the preserve.\nA sign marks several trails at Whiting Road Nature Preserve in Webster, which has 3.5 miles of trails. (Photo: Victoria E. Freile/@vfreile/)\nTrails are color-coded and offer a variety of difficulty, from easy to hilly. Some are narrow and steep, while others are flat and wide. Some trails traverse fields of wildflowers and others cross boardwalks and bypass forests of mature trees. The preserve's well-marked trails have maps attached to each sign, which is incredibly handy to check your progress if you leave your map at home.\nThere are a variety of trails that lead runners, hikers and cyclists through Whiting Road Nature Preserve in Webster. The park has 3.5 miles of multi-use trails. (Photo: Victoria E. Freile/@vfreile/)\nThe main entrance is on Whiting Road and has a small gravel parking lot. The second entrance is off Pellett Road. The property, about a mile south of Lake Ontario, is owned by the Town of Webster. Trails are maintained by the Friends of Webster Trails and other trail advocacy groups.\nAbraham Lincoln Park: This 182-acre county park in Penfield hugs the eastern shoreline of Irondequoit Bay. Formerly known as Irondequoit Bay Park East, the park was renamed for Abraham Lincoln in 2009.\nFrom Empire Boulevard, the park simply looks like a modern playground. Far from it. A colorful, traditional play area is merely a gateway to 3.5 miles of hiking trails, some of which are rather steep. Just yards into the woods is a natural play area carved from downed trees, which are quite an adventure for children and adults alike.\nBuy Photo Outdoors writer Victoria Freile high steps over blow down as she hikes the White Trail at Abraham Lincoln Park in Penfield Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nPhotographer Shawn Dowd and I explored Abraham Lincoln Park last week, following the park's white trail with plans to make our way toward Irondequoit Bay. We loved the varied scenery despite all the hills, but accidentally wandered off trail several times as we struggled to find trail markers on some of the paths. That led to a few dangerously steep inclines (and declines) that left us circling the woods.\nOnce we found our designated path (the green trail), we had no problems. Bay views were welcomed, although we saw a disappointing amount of garbage by the shoreline.\nBuy Photo Outdoors writer Victoria Freile hits the trails for an afternoon hike at Abraham Lincoln Park in Penfield Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nAbraham Lincoln, at 1559 Empire Blvd., Penfield, typically has a second northern entrance off Smith Road. Park officials this year closed that entrance as construction is underway on a bay side lodge in the park. The park is family friendly, but folks who struggle to navigate hilly terrain should be aware of potential hiking challenges.\nOatka Creek Park: The 461-acre county park is well off the main roadways in Wheatland in southwestern Monroe County. Most of Oatka Creek Park's six miles of trails are flat and lead visitors through mature forests, meadows and down to Oatka Creek, which cuts through the northern part of the park for about one mile. The park's westernmost trail, the Woodland Trail, is by far the most challenging with a single-file path that can become rather slippery and muddy when rainy. Most trails here are wide and family- and pet-friendly.\nWhen exploring the park with a friend last week, I encountered four other hikers, two of whom were walking with dogs. I walked four miles through all sorts of terrain and found the hike to be simple, beautiful and quiet — exactly what I hope for when hiking in the woods. I want to escape my busy life and enjoy nature in solitude, and Oatka Creek allows for that.\nThe orange trail in Oatka Creek Park in Wheatland hugs Oatka Creek. This Monroe County Park has about six miles of hiking trails. (Photo: Victoria E. Freile/@vfreile/)\nThere are stunning views of the creek, foliage and also a concrete bridge that will ferry hikers to the north side of the creek (and the half-mile long Bluebird trail.) In spring and early summer, you can often find anglers by Oatka Creek, as its a great spot for trout fishing.\nLocated at 9797 Union St., just southwest of Scottsville, visitors can park in the main lot, which is an extension of Quaker Road. Two other trailheads will lead to park entry off Stewart Road to the south and Scottsville Mumford Road to the north. The main lot is near the park's lone lodge, just off Union Street.\nLehigh Valley Trail: The stretch between River Road in Caledonia and Rochester Junction is an eight-mile hike with a history lesson to boot.\nThe rail-trail is a county park that follows the former Lehigh Valley Railroad tracks across southern Monroe County and a favorite hiking destination for colleague Bill Wolcott , who hikes 10 or more miles in western and central New York several times a month.\nA spur of the Lehigh Valley Trail runs north into Henrietta and eventually to the University of Rochester's River Campus, but hikers are forced onto streets with disconnected sections of the trail. This section of the rail-trail is entirely trail as hikers pass through Wadsworth Junction, Rush and Rochester Junction.\nSeveral abutments and a railroad bridge are all that remain of Wadsworth Junction as the Lehigh Valley Trail crosses the Genesee River and enters Rush. It’s here, on the west bank, where the Lehigh Valley connects with the Genesee Valley Greenway, another hiking trail that runs intermittently between Rochester and Olean.\nBack when this Lehigh Valley line was active, trains thundered over the top of the bridge at Wadsworth Junction over the Genesee River. Now hikers, cyclists and horseback riders pass through the supports underneath in a nifty bit of re-engineering in Rush. (Photo: Bill Wolcott/@billwlcott/)\nHikers can pause mid-hike for a bite at eateries on the south side of the trail in Rush. Or they can watch the waters of Honeoye Creek cascade over an old mill dam on the north side. Hikers can walk their lunches off with a final three-mile hike on the trail to Rochester Junction. Along the way you cross Honeoye Creek on another re-purposed railroad bridge.\nFor the full hike, there's a trailhead about three miles south of Scottsville in the Livingston County town of Caledonia. A small parking area is on the east side of River Road. This hike can also be shortened, with parking areas on East River Road and Rush in Monroe County.\nVFREILE@Gannett.com\nIncludes reporting by staff writer Bill Wolcott.", "external_links": ["http://www2.monroecounty.gov/parks-lehighvalley.php", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792053784264600-whiting-road-sign.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12aeef1f5e1ff888a38d3e60c7da7585c962a7a6/c=0-427-2448-2268&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792053784264600-whiting-road-sign.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/802c6add4b900f4408ea5d791764270498ad1dea/r=225x400/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793822077791367-hiking-023.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/863d01eb1eaea5ca7f90b838f0078940003059e4/c=0-248-636-1096&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793207023306394-oatka1.jpg", "http://www2.monroecounty.gov/parks-oatka.php", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1c2914dd408b4d8073015b39d812fdab83b87e5/c=0-292-1075-1725&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793822077791367-hiking-023.JPG", "http://www.webstertrails.org/wrnp/wrnp.php", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/734fac10538d13406c1d7cd31ef155a9e07b4676/r=300x400/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793781309476703-Bill-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140381051638-SD-100115-HIKING-E-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ada544ca84017f48045b04d7eb00c665df21e03/c=277-0-4618-3264&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140244706764-SD-100115-HIKING-C-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18b6850ecd1e7c167848c1a095f3c62acd352cdf/r=500x341/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140220994612-SD-100115-HIKING-A-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140244706764-SD-100115-HIKING-C-SPTS.jpg", "https://instagram.com/long.strider/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b55dc5093c740657fc63b09be56a0cc18be030ef/c=0-321-3248-4652&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140270914932-SD-100115-HIKING-H-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1267a2c65e666f719d2518bb61c3abfd8416075b/r=271x400/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140270914932-SD-100115-HIKING-H-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793781309476703-Bill-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140381051638-SD-100115-HIKING-E-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793822077791367-hiking-023.JPG", "https://instagram.com/sdowdphoto", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d87936826212cb0c21150c824cafe7f0f1817757/r=224x400/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793207023306394-oatka1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793207023306394-oatka1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b3a2fc9110d584c44a68729e1bdbc6c42f91bc66/c=219-0-4560-3264&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140220994612-SD-100115-HIKING-A-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140220994612-SD-100115-HIKING-A-SPTS.jpg", "http://www2.monroecounty.gov/parks-bayeast.php", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140244706764-SD-100115-HIKING-C-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140270914932-SD-100115-HIKING-H-SPTS.jpg", "http://www.townofbrighton.org/index.aspx?nid=262", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ac988fe86a2348d0196f485235835c25fed3dc2/c=0-0-2445-3260&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/Rochester/635793781309476703-Bill-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792053784264600-whiting-road-sign.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7bf4637395f822f2a25a437e5090666cc5690045/c=189-0-4530-3264&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Rochester/Rochester/635793140381051638-SD-100115-HIKING-E-SPTS.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:30:51.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
