Ann really was the gift that kept on giving, wasn't she? It's not just the dancers who can embarrass themselves, y'know! Mark and Karen were forced to restart their performance after their over-enthusiastic salsa moves somehow resulted in Mark's microphone becoming tangled in Karen's dress. Lisa and Brendan's freestyle displays the skill and finesse required to do well in the competition - but, the opening part where he picks her up is more than a little awkward, isn't it?
