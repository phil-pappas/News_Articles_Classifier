Everyone in our area is fed up with their behavior, but the Seahawks are giving them yet another chance. Attending Seahawks games has always been and should be a fun-filled event; instead it’s been reduced to an anxiety-ridden experience. \nRAVE To the state trooper ticketing the numerous I-405 drivers in single-occupant vehicles who ignore the requirement to use the metered lane. Those of us who see the violators whiz by on a daily basis appreciate the enforcement! \nRANT AND RAVE Rant to people who hum along with the orchestra at a symphony concert. Tickets for the Seattle Symphony are expensive, even on the third tier, and attendees come to listen to the performers, not to you! You might not be aware how far your voice carries, so please be mindful of others around you and listen with your ears, not your mouth. Rave to Seattle Symphony’s wonderful performance of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” last weekend.\nRAVE AND RANT Rave to the wonderful staff at the King County Library branch who went to extra measures to locate a hold item for me. Each person I encountered was so eager to assist and solve the mystery of the hidden audiobook. Thank you! Rant to the patron who took out her bad day on the library staff; no one within earshot appreciated your snarkiness, especially the hardworking librarians. \nMost Read Stories Seattle principal losing his job over unfinished teacher evaluations Seattle Seahawks' Kam Chancellor takes to Twitter to protest fine from NFL 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais may not be a sexy hire, but is he the right one?

RANT AND RAVE Rant to joggers wearing black/gray clothes that make them nearly invisible to drivers, especially when they eschew the sidewalks. Get a survival instinct! Flashing lights and reflective clothing are cheap; wear both. Raves to the few runners who are lit up like Christmas trees, use the sidewalks and look before crossing the street. \nRAVE To the fellow light-rail rider whose cheerful waving and goofy facial expressions were the perfect tantrum antidote for my overtired toddler. I was flat out of tricks to keep my son quiet, and our lucky break in encountering this good-humored passenger made the rest of our trip home a breeze. \nRANT To King County Superior Court for summoning me to jury duty for a fourth time, refusing my request to be excused since I’d already served three times. Shouldn’t there be a limit to the number of times an individual is required to serve? The court should be pursuing those who have never served.\nThe Seattle Times publishes reader rants and raves on a space-available basis. We reserve the right to edit for length or content.
