He's also a producer, director, writer and actor. Let's look at career highlights. Glenn Whipp Contact Reporter \nChris Rock will host the 88th Oscars, the film academy announced today, returning the comedian to a gig that earned him wildly divided reviews in his one and only turn at the job 11 years ago. \nRock's second stint as host had been predicted as a strong possibility since the academy hired Reginald Hudlin and David Hill to produce the 2016 show. Hudlin worked with Rock previously, directing the pilot episode of Rock's TV show \"Everybody Hates Chris.\" Hudlin also produced the academy's Governors Awards last year where Rock was on hand to pay tribute to Harry Belafonte. \nThe academy will hope that Rock can deliver better reviews and, more importantly, higher ratings than last year's show. The 2015 telecast's audience dropped nearly 15%, with host Neil Patrick Harris struggling through a sluggishly paced evening. In 2014, the Ellen DeGeneres-hosted show, with its star-studded selfie that temporarily disabled Twitter and other interactive skits and bits, drew an average of nearly 44 million viewers. \nSIGN UP for the free Classic Hollywood newsletter >> \nRock's previous stint as Oscars host produced a wide range of reactions, with USA Today crowning him \"one of the worst hosts ever,\" while Roger Ebert praised a \"home run\" opening monologue that was \"surprisingly pointed, topical, and not shy of controversy.\" \nChris Rock’s Oscar-hosting stint in 2005 didn’t exactly pass universal muster . So it’s not likely -- in the jittery, offend-lightly world of modern awards-show hosting -- that he’ll be given the gig again any time soon. \nBut Rock's appearance at Tuesday night’s National Board of Review prizes in... \nChris Rock’s Oscar-hosting stint in 2005 didn’t exactly pass universal muster . So it’s not likely -- in the jittery, offend-lightly world of modern awards-show hosting -- that he’ll be given the gig again any time soon. \nBut Rock's appearance at Tuesday night’s National Board of Review prizes in... (Steven Zeitchik) \nThe most notable point of contention came from a running joke about actor Jude Law's then-ubiquitous presence in Hollywood. \"Who is Jude Law?\" Rock asked. \"Why is he in every movie I have seen in the last four years? Even if he's not acting in it, if you look at the credits he makes the cupcakes or something.\" \nLater in the ceremony, Sean Penn, presenting the lead actress Oscar, felt compelled to defend Law. \"Forgive my lack of humor,\" Penn harumphed. \"Jude Law is one of our most talented actors.\" \nThe divisiveness illustrates the no-win nature of the job. The show's rigid format -- 24 award categories, 24 speeches, 24 opportunities for long-winded winners to be played off the stage -- limits the host's ability to impact the evening. \n\"I mean, why not, but I'm surprised,\" comedian Sarah Silverman told The Times, talking about Rock's decision to accept the job. \"It's such a thankless job. Steve Martin did so well that one year. And he told me he had so much fun -- until he made the mistake the next day of looking at what people had to say. It took him years to get over it.\" \nThere is evidence that Rock has honed his skills in the decade since he hosted the Oscars in 2005. Last year, with his critically acclaimed comedy \"Top Five\" arriving in theaters just as awards were starting to be handed out in earnest, the 50-year-old comedian made the rounds on the trophy dinner circuit. \nRock rarely disappointed during his time on stage, lampooning the season's empty rituals and rampant self-importance. Hoisting his own prize at the vacuous Hollywood Film Awards, Rock emoted, \"All my life I've dreamt of getting one of these, like everyone else in the room! I can't believe this day has come!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:41:57.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
