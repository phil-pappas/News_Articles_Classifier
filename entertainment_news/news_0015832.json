In some photos obtained by Mail Online , her tearful mother Bridget led hundreds of mourners through the streets as her coffin was taken to Our Lady of Fatima church where she will be laid to rest on the following day. It could be seen that the coffin was carried by members of Cathriona's family from the funeral home to a waiting black hearse before it was taken to the church in preparation for Cathriona's Requiem Mass. According to the website, there were around 200 people walking beside Cathriona's family as the hearse brought it to the church. The procession followed behind the hearse which carried Cathriona's body. Alongside Cathriona's mother who led the mourners, there were Cathriona's stepmother Brid, brother James, sisters Lisa and Sarah, stepbrother Tadgh and her half-sister Larina. The coffin reposed overnight before the ceremony. She will be buried next to her father, Pat. Because of the number of mourners expected at the funeral, a special speaker system has been put outside the church for the service. Cathriona's ex-boyfriend Jim reportedly arrived at Dublin Airport on Friday at 2:20 A.M. The 53-year-old actor is expected to attend the funeral service in her hometown. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:09:20.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
