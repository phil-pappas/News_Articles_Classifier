(Read: Andhra Pradesh’s capital city project yet to get environmental clearance) \nThe Yatra was flagged off by former Minister and senior Vice President Congress, Manhor Lal Sharma in presence of National Secretary Indian Youth Congress, Uma Shanker Pandey, at Lakahnpur today.The Yatra will culminate in Leh on November 3, after coverng 22 districts of the state, President, JKPYC, Pranav Shagotras said. \nMore than seven lakh educated youth are waiting for jobs and this government has failed to initiate any concrete step in this direction, Shagotra claimed.During the Yatra, PYC will organize foot marches at the district headquarters and town, and will organize protest demonstration against the recently-adopted requirement policy, he said. \nA large number of youth participated in the Yatra and marched from Lakhanpur to Kathua Town. After a strong protest demonstration in Kathua, the Yatra moved to district Samaba in the form of cars and motorcycles rally.Addressing the gathering, Pandey emphasized upon the youth of Jammu and Kashmir to join this mass movement in a large scale to get rid of the anti-youth policies of the government. \nHe assured the youth that PYC will not allow the PDP-BJP to play with their careers.Shagotra said that since the government did not respond to our repeated requests and appeals for scraping the recently-adopted requirement policy and did not settle issues of thousands of daily wagers, NYCs and other educated unemployed youth, PYC is compelled to launch this mass movement for the cause and rights of youth of the state. \nShagotra further added that this yatra is against the growing unemployment, wrong recruitment policies of the government and apathy towards thousands of daily wagers of the state. He added that the BJP-PDP government has forgotten all the pre-poll promises made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir \n  7:50 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:01:13.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
