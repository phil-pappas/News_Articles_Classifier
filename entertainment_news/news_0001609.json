(For example), many kids with concussions have headaches. It doesn't measure the headache. It doesn't measure dizziness.\"\nThe test is ideally taken before a season starts, but even midseason, absent any concussive incidents, Rempson recommends that parents bring a student in.\n\"You're in effect taking a test to basically see, when you're healthy, how you score,\" he said. After a concussion or something similar, he said, \"you're retesting to see if certain aspects of that change.\"\nAnd even after recovery, \"We retest them to see if things have gone back to the way they were before the injury.\"\nRempson said parents in many locations should be able to find someone to facilitate the test .\nIdeally, that time with a doctor also will include a bit of information about what a concussion is and how it's managed and treated, he added.\nHe recommends these tests starting at age 10, before every season, and every one or two years following.\nThe One Simple Thing series appears weekly, offering specific and small ways to improve health.\nabowen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @byalisonbowen\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["https://www.impacttest.com/find_care_provider", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625267e/turbine/sc-one-simple-thing-baseline-concussion-test-health-1028-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:54:18.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
