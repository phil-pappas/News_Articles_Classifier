Wildcats. Back then in 2001, no one ever would have predicted Rochester would go the next 13 years without hoisting a trophy. After all, the Rhinos won A-League crowns in 1998, 2000 and 2001 and the 1999 U.S. Open Cup championship. Four titles in their first six years. They were the most decorated professional soccer team in North America — and Lilley's archrival.\nHershey couldn't beat Pat Ercoli's Rhinos. Oh, Lilley stole a U.S. Open match once in 2001, but in the playoffs Rochester owned him, taming the Wildcats in the 1999 conference final and 2000 quarterfinals and then that 2001 title match, 2-0, at Frontier Field.\nRochester hosts the L.A. Galaxy II in Friday, Oct. 16, night's 2015 USL Championship. Video by Jeff DiVeronica\nWhich makes Friday night even more intriguing because now Lilley, 49, is in his fourth season coaching the Rhinos and they host the Los Angeles Galaxy II in the USL Championship at Sahlen's Stadium. If he becomes the coach to lead Rochester back into the winner's circle, working with Ercoli as team president, everything would come full circle.\nBut there's more.\nLilley was also on the sideline the last time the Rhinos played in a championship match in 2006, and he finally got his revenge on Rochester. His Vancouver Whitecaps out-classed Laurie Calloway's Rhinos 3-0 at PAETEC Park, which was then the name of Rochester's new soccer stadium. It was supposed to be a crowning moment, the start of a new era of Rhinos soccer in their own home.\nAnd Lilley's club clobbered Rochester.\n\"Coach Lilley’s a genius,\" Rhinos midfielder and team captain Tony Walls said after Saturday's 1-0 win over Louisville City FC .\nWalls knows how much Lilley invests. He watches game tapes until his eyes won't stay open, studying opposing players and team's tendencies, logging all that time so he can share a scouting report with his players to give them an edge or, if you will, leg up. Louisville was the USL's highest scoring team with 55 goals. The Rhinos shut them out twice and gave up one-in-three meetings. Louisville managed just three shots on Saturday.\nThese Rhinos don't draw as many fans as past title teams, but they've authored a season that is comparable, matching franchise regular-season records for shutouts (17) and goals allowed (15). In 30 matches, including the playoffs, they've lost just once. They're 19-1-10. Snicker if you want about 10 ties. One loss? It's still quite remarkable to me and better than the 24-4 A-League championship team in 1998.\nBut here's the reality of pro sports in America. It won't mean much unless Rochester finds a way to beat L.A., the reserve team for one of Major League Soccer's powerhouses. The Rhinos will need to do it without their two top scorers, rookie forward Christian Volesky (concussion) and Steevan Dos Santos (suspension).\nDos Santos was ejected Saturday in the 83rd minute for head-butting a Louisville player. It was dumb and immature and has hurt his team's chances to win a title. But there's another thing about this group: They've bought into Lilley's Way, which is that hard work trumps everything else and if you do that you'll win a lot more than you lose.\nSome times players don't buy in. That's why Lilley walked away from the Rhinos after coaching them in 2010 and 2011. They'd won back-to-back regular-season titles, but when he thought he didn't get the best he could out of the 2011 squad, he resigned. Coaching meant too much to him. It still means a lot, but he's gained some perspective.\nThat's why he came back before last season, rebuilding a roster that desperately needed it after the 2013 season when the Rhinos finished 11th and missed the playoffs for the only time in their 20-year history. He's got a great eye for talent and how players fit together. No Lilley-coached team has ever missed the playoffs in his 14 USL seasons. Half have finished in first place.\nWhen the Montreal Impact won the USL title 2004, they did it with the roster Lilley built in 2002 and 2003 after Hershey had folded.\nHe's the hardest-working coach I've met and he won't rest or fully enjoy the moment until the season is done. There's always the next practice, the next match. I often wondered how a man who is so demanding of his players could go from coaching male pros to teenage girls, which he did for the Pennsylvania Classics club team in 2012 and 2013 in between his Rhinos' stints.\nBut the best coaches are good teachers and to his core, that's Lilley. He won't just tell you how a play developed, he'll show you. He'll grab a few empty cans on a table or glasses on a bar and start positioning them like they're players on the field (I've actually seen this happen). I was reminded again Saturday night of his thirst to teach.\nIt was late. All the fans and players had left the field and Sahlen's Stadium was empty. There was Lilley, sitting on the bench and talking with Dos Santos, the 26-year-old who'd been ejected. That red card wasn't the end of the world. It was another teachable moment, Lilley trying to help a player get better. It's never about just winning for Lilley, it's about the process and doing the right things to help you win.\nUSL Championship\nMatchup: Rochester Rhinos (19-1-10) vs. L.A.
