St. Edward has been on the road since.\nVideo and pictures of a mostly-brown field ended up on the news and even the butt of late-night television jokes. Even with on-line fundraising, the school's leadership didn't know how, or when, they would be able to fix the field and get their team back at home.\nBut Scotts, the lawn and garden chemical company, stepped up. Chris Strunk, the marking and communication director for the Columbus, Ohio, based company, heard about the damaged field. The company had an initiative this year to renovate athletic fields across the country and were looking for the next project, Strunk said. The St. Ed's dilemma sounded like the perfect project for them.\nSo he contacted the school's athletic director and offered their services.\nThe estimate to prep the field and put new sod down initially was $200,000, but Scotts did the field prep work and donated the new, athletic-grade sod, Strunk said. It went down Oct. 3.\nThe field was laser-leveled before the sod was put down, too, to ensure optimal drainage.\nWhile plans were for the football program to play its final regular game of the season at home, the weather put a damper on those plans. With rain in the forecast, the fear was the field just wasn't ready for a full night of football. The game was moved to Geneva.\nBut that didn't stop the team and the fans from checking out their new field Friday. And Urlacher was brought in by Scotts to talk to the team and see the field. He spoke to the freshman through senior players and cheerleaders in the gym before going out to toss a football around with some of those players.\nPersonally, Urlacher said, playing football in high school was his favorite time as a player — above his college years and the years he played in the NFL.\nHe admits he was \"lazy in high school,\" but added that his coaches back then were some of the largest influences on his life. By the time he got to college, he started playing hard. He always liked hitting — that is why he became a defensive player and one of the things he liked about the Bears. The Chicago team had a reputation for hitting hard, he said.\nHe gave the players other advise, too, like always remembering that the most important play of the game is the next one — not the one that just went badly or even the one that went off without a hitch.\nSenior linebacker Jake Harrington, 17, said that the team is excited to play on the field yet this year. They are expected to make the playoffs and might still get that chance.\nIncluding his time in junior football, he's played on Greg True Field for 10 years and said the new field is completely new — even feeling different under his feet.\n\"It is nothing like it was before,\" Harrington said.\nJanelle Walker is a freelance reporter for The Courier-News.\nCopyright © 2015, Elgin Courier-News Brian Urlacher Chicago Bears", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ae8b4/turbine/ct-ecn-brian-urlacher-st-eds-st-1025-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:20:22.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
