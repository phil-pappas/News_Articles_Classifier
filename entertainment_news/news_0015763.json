The first screening in CIFF’s yearlong, statewide tour to build support for a just transition and sustainable future in Maine will be presented during the land trust’s educational panel on climate change Thursday, Nov. 5. \nThe event will run from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at the Strand Theatre, 345 Main St., featuring keynote speaker Stephen Mulkey and an esteemed panel of environmental experts. \nAs a lead-in to the Climate Change and Our Economy: A Positive Vision for Maine in an Era of Rapid Climate Change panel, CIFF will present the four-minute animated short, “A Climate Calamity in the Gulf of Maine: The Lobster Pot Heats Up.” The film balances humor with chilling facts about Maine’s lobster industry in the face of climate change. \n“A Climate Calamity” was produced by husband-and-wife animation team Andy O’Brien and Hanji Chang of Rockland. Known as O’Chang Studios, they are the team behind viral comic animations about Maine life, “Temp Tales.” \n“This partnership is ideal as we kick off the Sustainable Maine screenings,” said Ben Fowlie, CIFF Founder and Executive Director. \nSustainable Maine is an action-oriented public engagement program of the Camden International Film Festival designed to connect Maine-based environmental leaders and allies with powerful documentary films that spark public dialogue and responsive, local actions to address the intersecting environmental challenges (and opportunities) related to climate change, ocean and land conservation, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy. \nGeneral admission tickets for the forum and screening are $20, $15 for Georges River Land Trust members. For advance tickets, call 594-5166 or visit georgesriver.org . Students with valid ID will be offered a special $10 ticket price if they call. Tickets will be available at the box office on the event day for cash only. \nAn exclusive members-only pre-event reception with the speakers and filmmakers also is offered. The reception tickets include appetizers and drinks, as well as front-of-the-house seating. To learn more about how to become a member of the Georges River Land Trust, visit the website. Bangor Savings Bank has provided generous sponsorship for this event, with supporting sponsorship provided by The Strand. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
