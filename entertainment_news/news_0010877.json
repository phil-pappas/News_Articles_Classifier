The opera house had initially advertised his return date as November 2. \nConductor Marco Armiliato, a veteran of Met opera productions, will step in for Friday's season premiere, with another Italian, Paolo Carignani, leading three performances later this month. \nIn 2013, Domingo was hospitalised in Spain for the blockage of a lung artery, and in 2010 he underwent surgery for colon cancer. \nBut Domingo maintains an active schedule and is due in April to return to the Met to sing in Verdi's \"Simon Boccanegra.\" AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:03:17.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
