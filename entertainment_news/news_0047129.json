There are now late night screenings (11:30 p.m.) too in select SM cinemas.\nWe’ve seen the film and while some people find it too long at three hours, it’s only because it completely captures the life of its subject; every important turning point from the cradle to the grave. “Felix Manalo” makes no qualms in its aim to preach, but it goes beyond that by offering interesting points (wartime scenes, funeral scene) to keep even non-INC (Iglesia Ni Cristo) members glued to their seats.\nDennis Trillo’s performance in the titular character of INC first executive minister is quite impressive. He could give more seasoned actors a run for their money in the coming acting awards derby. His edge, though, are the remarkable physical transformations as his character ages (reminding us of the Brad Pitt-starrer “The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button”); and the masterful way he handled scenes wherein Manalo mulls his convictions and eventually – staunchly – defends it from others.\nAs far as production goes, it’s clear a lot of money and thought were put into making the movie. Then again, that’s no surprise because “Felix Manalo” will likely be screened in several INC gatherings for many years to come. If INC was going for quality film that could weather the test of time, whether solely for own consumption and entertainment or for the world to see, they have it here.\n“Felix Manalo” also stars Bela Padilla, Gabby Concepcion, Jaclyn Jose, Gladys Reyes, Bobby Andrews, Andrea del Rosario, and Ruru Madrid.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:37:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
