ADVERTISEMENT \nHe praised Vachal for her “delicate approach to songs.” \n“I can only imagine people listening to your voice after having a really tough day, you just make everything feel like it’s gonna be all right. You are amazing,” Williams said. \nJudge Gwen Stefani said their performance was “so beautiful,” but described Amy as a star, once again comparing her to Pocahontas. \n“On my mind, her on her own, she is a star,” Stefani said, referring to Vachal. \nAdam Levine said Vachal was “shining up there on (her) own.” \nWhen it’s Blake Shelton’s turn to give his comments, he said it still hurts that Vachal didn’t pick him during the blind auditions. \n“Amy, the most hurtful rejection I have ever had on this show is when you didn’t pick me in the blind auditions. It still hurts right now,” Shelton said. \nDuring her blind auditions, Vachal got a standing ovation from the three judges. \nThe only coach who did not turn his chair for Vachal was Levine, who was apologetic for not turning around because his team was already full. \nIn the end, Vachal made the decision and picked Williams as her coach. \nDuring “The Voice’s” previous season, another Filipino, Nathan Hermida, made it to the live rounds as part of Team Adam.
