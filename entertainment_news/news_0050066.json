We tend to think of PBS as the place for something different, not another offering in a genre that already overstuffs Food Network and the Travel Channel. \nHost Phil Rosenthal, best known as the creator of “Everybody Loves Raymond,” visits spots around the globe and introduces us to local purveyors of the region’s cuisine. Rosenthal is a decent host; his comic chops give the show a humorous tinge, but his food commentary tends to be of the “this is the best (fill in the blank) ever” variety. \nMore importantly, this show – and everything else in the genre – pales next to Anthony Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown” on CNN, like an Olive Garden next to a Michelin star restaurant. Bourdain’s show, which airs at 6 and 9 p.m. Sundays and recently began its fourth season, takes us into a culture and its cuisine with far more authority and genuineness. \nIt’s not that “I’ll Have What Phil’s Having” is bad, but it’s comfort food at best. \nVerdict: Watch “Parts Unknown” first WATCH THIS \n“The Voice” 8 p.m. NBC I’m not a huge fan of “The Voice,” but its blind-auditions sequence is by far the best part of any season. Those conclude tonight, with a recap of the five sessions on Tuesday. After that, “The Voice” goes into its over-inflated middle segment, where weeks are spent narrowing the teams down before the live finals. SKIP THAT \n“The Real Housewives of Orange County” 9 p.m. The flood of new shows has kept me from reminding everyone not to watch our local edition of the Housewives for a couple of weeks, but my recommendation has not changed in the interim. You have to love the title of tonight’s episode, though: “Satan Loves Confusion.” \nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.
