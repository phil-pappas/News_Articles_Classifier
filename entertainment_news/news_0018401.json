The 23-year-old told Billboard magazine she was treated in late 2013 and early 2014 after she cancelled the Asian and Australian legs of her Stars Dance tour.\n\"I was diagnosed with lupus, and I’ve been through chemotherapy. That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke,\" she said.\nShe later spent time at a rehabilitation facility in Arizona and her representatives were forced to deny claims by some gossip websites that she had a drug problem.\n\"I wanted so badly to say: 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're a**holes'.\"\n\"I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\" She said the disease is now in remission.\nGomez acted in the Disney Channel's Wizards Of Waverly Place before becoming a pop star with hits such as Come & Get It and So Good.\nShe was in a high-profile relationship with Justin Bieber for a number of years and admitted the press scrutiny was hard to deal with.\n\"I'm so f***ing nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me. I’ve been working since I was 7.\n\"I’ve been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17. It’s so disappointing that I’ve become a tabloid story.\"\nGomez said she is staying healthy now through \"diet, routine and medication,\" as well as by surrounding herself with supportive friends such as Taylor Swift.\nLupus causes fibrous tissue and inflammation of internal organs, skin rashes and joint pain.\nIt affects women nine times more than men. Organs affected by lupus include the kidneys, heart and lungs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:56:54.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
