I heard the song when I first set eyes on the 1953 Doris Day film Calamity Jane , when I was about eight years old. I fell in love with Doris then and there. I loved her as the rooting, tooting, whip-cracking, sharp-shooting tomboy, who ended up as the blushing bride. My mum and my Aunty Rita and I used to sing it together in three-part harmony at family parties. It's a beautiful old song that holds a lot of happy memories for me.\n\n \nAdvertisement Dolly Parton - Jolene \nDolly Parton has always been one of my favourite singer-songwriters (and businesswomen). This song has been around me all my life. Actually, I probably heard my mother [country singer and yodeler Mary Schneider] singing Jolene  in her stage show before I heard the Dolly recording of it. When I was a little kid, I used to fall asleep under mum's fur coat backstage while mum was performing, so this song became part of my psyche. You can hear the pain in the lyric â€“ most women have had a Jolene-type character in their life at some point, so it's easy to relate to. Dolly won out in the end though, she's laughing all the way to the bank.\nBonnie Raitt - I Can't Make You Love Me \n\nPeople may not consider this to be a country song, but it was written as one by a Nashville songwriter called Mike Reid. I had the great pleasure of writing with him a few years ago over in Nashville and he's just incredible. This song is such a heartbreaking one. Most of us have been through the experience of being in love with someone who doesn't love you back for whatever reason and when it comes to matters of the heart, there's nothing worse.  \nGeorge Jones - Choices  \n\nGeorge Jones is one of my favourite singers. His 1999 hit Choices  from the album  Cold Hard Truth  earned him a Grammy for Best Male Vocal Performance. I think this one's a true country song in every way, lyrically, melodically and instrumentally. The chorus goes: I've had choices since the day that I was born / \nThere were voices that told me right from wrong /  If I had listened, no I wouldn't be here today / Living and dying with the choices I've made. And ain't that the cold hard truth! \n\n\n  \nRicky Skaggs - Hallelujah I'm Ready Ricky Skaggs is my biggest vocal influence when it comes to country and bluegrass. I remember listening to his 1985 album  Country Boy  on LP in my bedroom for hours and hours when I was growing up. He's also an incredible guitarist and mandolin player, so musically, it's just brilliant. I was so excited by his rapid bluegrass picking. This song is a fast gospel/bluegrass song and I still sing it on stage sometimes. Hallelujah, I'm ready. I can hear the voices singing soft and low / Hallelujah, I'm ready, hallelujah I'm ready to go. When I found out that Skaggs, my idol, had recorded two of my original songs on his last two albums, I was thrilled. There's nothing better than that.
