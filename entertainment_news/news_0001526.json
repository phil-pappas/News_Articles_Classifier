Others died in startling ways. Electricity proved to be dangerous, and nurses and doctors played with a newfangled X-ray machine as if it were an office copier, unaware, in 1901, that overexposure to their new toy might kill them. \nAs Season 2 begins tomorrow night, \"The Knick\" is as engrossing and disturbing as ever, and the medical gore's only a small piece of it. \nDirector Steven Soderbergh's lighting may be early 20th century, but that light's diffused through a prism of 21st-century sensibilities. Accompanied by an electronic score, \"The Knick\" can feel very much of the moment. And it's kind of an ugly moment. \nAnti-immigrant sentiment. Political and corporate corruption. A yawning gap between rich and poor, and, of course, large dollops of racism and sexism. \nBeyond reminding us of the limits that persist in a medical system we like to think of as cutting-edge, creators Jack Amiel and Michael Begler expand their focus this season to mental illness and addiction, the treatments of which prove as startling as those for the physical ailments of the day. As one character puts it, \"Psychiatry is a very new field, and things always look worse at the beginning.\" \nClive Owen returns as Dr. John Thackery, who was chief surgeon at the fictionalized (but not wholly fictional) Knickerbocker Hospital before his addiction to cocaine got out of control. As the season opens, he's still in rehab, such as it is, and nurse Lucy Elkins (Eve Hewson), his lover and enabler, is counting the days to his return. \nAndre Holland (\"42\") is Dr. Algernon Edwards, a Harvard-educated surgeon who has his eye on Thackery's job, but whose prospects aren't bright: He's a black doctor in a hospital that serves (and largely employs) only whites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:17:59.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
