(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Actor Shia LaBeouf has been arrested and charged with public intoxication after an incident in Austin, Texas. \nThe Austin Police Department said in a news release that LaBeouf was arrested at 7:33 p.m. Friday. \nJail records show he was booked into the Travis County Jail and released on his own recognizance. No attorney was listed on the record. \nHe was arrested in the city’s Sixth Street entertainment district, where the Austin City Limits music festival is taking place through Sunday. \nPolice have not responded to a request from The Associated Press for additional details. His publicist did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest. \nThe 29-year-old previously made headlines with bizarre escapades — including yelling from the audience during a Broadway show and wearing a paper bag on his head to a movie premiere — and has been treated for an alcohol problem.
