By Saturday, the US Airways name will disappear. The carrier is merging with American Airlines .\nCustomers should see few changes in terms of service. Under American, the US Airways schedule out of Rochester will stay the same, said Josh Freed, a spokesman for American. US Airways' employees will remain at the airport, too.\nUS Airways has been directing ticket buyers to American since July, and people who booked tickets further in advance should have received notice by now that American will handle their flight when it merges reservation systems.\n\"For you guys and everyone else, this is a straight-up name change,” Freed said.\nBuy Photo Dual signage at the Greater Rochester International Airport. (Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\nUS Airways was at one time the dominant airline in Rochester. A 1999 Democrat and Chronicle story said the carrier handled 60 percent of all passengers from Rochester.\nIts passenger share had dipped to 18.5 percent, according to the airport's 2013-14 annual report, surpassed by Southwest, United and Delta.\nMany of the 25 US Airways employees at the Rochester airport have fond memories of their careers with the airline, said Robert Morgan, the local general manager for US Airways and now for American. Many have worked there for more than 20 years, he said.\nWhile the change is bittersweet, it's also promising because the merged company will be a more viable competitor, Morgan said.\n“Now we’re on a level playing field,\" Morgan said. \"We’re all excited about that.”\nUS Airways has been offering direct flights from Rochester to Boston; Philadelphia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Washington, D.C. American had been offering direct flights to Chicago. Combined, they handle between 400 and 500 flights a month, according to American.\nThe final US Airways flight to depart Greater Rochester International Airport was scheduled to take off at 7:14 p.m. on Friday, bound for Boston.\nThere already are signals of the switch at the airport — the sign at the US Airways ticket counter already has been switched to American, spokeswoman Jennifer Hanrahan said.\nStarting Saturday, US Airways' website and mobile app will redirect to AA.com .\nDRILEY@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98778dcbaa11b51f51b34046d055dc438d7f240a/c=422-0-4743-3249&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806038357292432-JG-101615-Airline-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806038357292432-JG-101615-Airline-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb36a1c508d300138d7ebac84ee3b457bc87e642/r=500x319/local/-/media/2015/10/16/Rochester/Rochester/635806038357292432-JG-101615-Airline-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:53:27.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
