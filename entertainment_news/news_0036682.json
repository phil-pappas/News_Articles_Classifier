This is MENAJI! This is what we do – from making the entertainer look awesome on stage to allowing Jeff to keep his skin healthy while on the road with minimal effort, fixing everything from bags under the eyes from sleepless nights to covering up blemishes from roadie fast-food – our fast-acting skincare is the best for fast-paced, busy lifestyles!” said MENAJI President Pamela Viglielmo.\n“As a performer I have realized that image is everything and that sometimes the smallest of details can make the biggest difference. I have taken my skin for granted for years, but ever since I have incorporated MENAJI skincare products into my daily routine and pre-show routine the ‘critics are raving!’ Friends and family say I have a new ‘glow.’ As a male performer I have never really wanted to put on any kind of ‘make-up’ for my shows and now with MENAJI skincare products it’s like I’m not wearing any. A clean shave with MENAJI ClearShave, followed by the Power Hydrator Aftershave, and then a little 911 Eye Gel and I'm good to go. Thanks MENAJI for giving me that extra glow for my show!” said Grainger.\nPerforming many of Sinatra’s most popular and classic hits, Grainger invokes the imagination and provokes one’s emotions during an incredible journey set in one unforgettable evening.
