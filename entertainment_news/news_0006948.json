The US Geological Survey reports nine quakes ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 3.7 were recorded between 5:07 pm yesterday and 5:27 am today. \nNo injuries or damage were reported. Geologists say damage is not likely in quakes below magnitude 4.0. Those follow a 4.5 magnitude temblor Saturday afternoon near Cushing and a 4.4 magnitude quake Saturday morning southwest of Medford. Cushing is where the world’s most important crude oil storage hub is located and it is used to settle futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nCushing Emergency Management Director Bob Noltensmeyer has said there are no reports of significant damage, only “shattered nerves.” \n  12, 2015 12:09 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:58:12.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
