He’s a prosecutor and part-time Austin musician who works very hard to keep his worst impulses in check. Or so he tells us. The narrator of Mark Pryor’s thriller can be a bit unreliable. Sociopaths are like that.\nPryor, who lives in Austin and wrote the Hugo Marston suspense series, has hatched an innovative concept for a novel. Frustrated that his efforts at living a normal life haven’t paid off, Dominic gets involved in a heist. Naturally, the nobody-gets-hurt plan goes awry, leaving two dead bodies. Can this sociopath pull off the perfect crime?\nHollow Man is a fast, fun but ultimately confounding read. Much of the book hums along like a well-oiled machine, so the backfires are especially startling.\nIt’s no surprise that the book would be full of double- and even triple-crosses. It was a surprise, however, that one trap was so labored and obvious that surely even Wile E. Coyote could have spotted it.\nThe sociopathic narrator poses a conundrum for the reader and the critic: When secondary characters seem sketchily drawn, is that because the author hasn’t fleshed them out, or is that because the narrator naturally has limited interest in other people? He only cares about how he can use them.\nDominic’s love interest (is Dominic capable of love?) is particularly a cipher. Her stated goal is to keep her juvenile-delinquent brother out of further legal trouble. But her actions, which include having him steal a van, don’t seem to match her intentions. That’s convenient for the plot but confusing for the reader. Where’s the disconnect?\nPop culture is full of so-called “sympathetic” sociopaths, characters we’re encouraged to root for even as they do their worst: Tony Soprano, Walter White, Frank Underwood. Dominic aspires to join that club. He didn’t mean for anyone to get hurt. Any violence in his past was justified. And when he turns against one of his co-conspirators, well, that guy was a bad man who deserved punishment, right?\nBut wait. Didn’t Dominic discover the evidence of his co-conspirator’s evil nature after he’d already decided to double-cross him? I judged this logic error to be a sociopath’s self-justification, one of those things that happens when your narrator is unreliable. But because the book wasn’t entirely airtight, it did give me pause.\nHollow Man would probably make an excellent caper flick. (There’s even one trick very reminiscent of Ocean’s Eleven .) A film would have the benefit of the flashback to unravel all the twists and turns. Alas, this is print, and Pryor relies on Dominic’s explaining the con to his unfortunate mark — the ultimate tell rather than show.\nIt would be a mistake, though, to dwell too much on the book’s miscues. There is one revelation at the end that will take most readers by surprise. And Dominic is a fascinating protagonist. Just don’t believe everything he tells you.\nShawna Seed is the author of Not in Time, a novel about looted art. She lives in Oak Cliff.\nHollow Man Mark Pryor (Seventh Street, $15.95)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:57:24.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
