On October 3, the band traveled to the campus of Parkview High School in Springfield to compete in the 15th Annual Valhalla Marching Band Festival. A total of 36 bands participated in the event. In preliminary competition, Aurora placed first in its class of nine. It also received caption awards for best marching, auxiliary, woodwinds and soloist. Finals competition was comprised of the first-place winners of the four classes, plus the next eight highest scoring bands, regardless of class. Aurora placed fifth overall, following four larger class bands from Willard; Ozark; Mt. Home, Arkansas; and Blue Valley Southwest from Overland Park, Kansas. The band students and directors expressed appreciation to the Band Boosters and parents who volunteer their time to cook, feed, chaperone, drive trailers and help with pit crew at the festivals. The band’s next competition is October 17 at the University of Central Missouri’s Festival of Champions in Warrensburg.
