Thanks to the creative thinking of an inventor from Warrenton, Va., you can use those pictures to enhance your bathroom décor with very little time and effort. She developed MEMORY CURTAIN to provide a unique way to display photos for fun and enjoyment. As such, it preserves family memories, achievements and interests. At the same time, it provides an inexpensive way of regularly updating and changing the appearance of the bathroom. Simply stated, it makes an attractive addition to any bathroom décor providing a novel way to share family highlights with visitors. It is also convenient, easy to use and affordably priced. In addition, its simple design minimizes production costs.\nThe inventor’s personal experience inspired the idea. “This idea emerged while joking around with friends and family about what to do with old photos that might otherwise end up lost or discarded. A shower curtain seemed like the perfect surface on which to create a photo collage.\nThe original design was submitted to the Washington, DC, office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
