When he is not creating a set or a scene, he is either exploring creative energies during the time he spends with his family or can be spotted doodling away as he observes people at any one of the city's pubs. While he has been part of the big screen for a couple of one-off roles, it is the upcoming thriller Ring Master that sees him in a full-fledged lead role for the first time. Over a conversation about films and world views in general, Arun tells us about the kind of work that offers him satisfaction. Excerpts:\nFrom what we see in the trailers, your role in Ring Master looks nothing less than scary. What made you take up something like this? I have played a few characters in Kannada films before, and I have consciously tried to take up characters that interest and challenge me as an actor. They may have been small roles, but they are ones that have allowed me to make an impact. When Ring Master came up, I found the character extremely intriguing. I play an entertainer, but one whose demeanour changes from buffoonery to someone who is out there to bring in a rather serious change. The other challenging aspect of working in this film was that the entire story takes place in one night, within a span of three hours, in one room mostly, and has just four people right through. For a script like this, one actor feeds off the other and each one has to be good. Only good actors can create a good scene. I did this film to see to what extent I can use myself as an actor.\nActing has been a part of your career for a long time. But so is art direction. What makes you keep changing what you do? I have been part of the theatre group Rangayana for over nine years. We travelled a lot with some great plays. BV Karanth is my guru. One thing that experiences like theatre does for you is that you get the opportunity to explore, experiment and finally find yourself doing what you enjoy doing the most. Over the years, I found myself as an artist and I find art direction mentally challenging, and now, financially satisfying too. I went on to work as an art director in Kannada films. But it was Sudeep who rediscovered me as an actor. He gave me the opportunity to act on the big screen.\nDo you feel your stint on television helped rediscover you as well? I was just as talented before I went into the Bigg Boss house as I am now. But nothing works like fame. Fame is important, because that's when talent gets noticed. I will always be thankful for my stint on TV. So much so that we are working on some interesting concepts for a TV show that will come up soon.\nThe Kannada film industry is undoubtedly going through a change right now, with smaller films with good stories making it big. Do you feel Ring Master is in sync with the trend? The audience here is a lot more aware and educated than others, because people have access to watching just about all kinds of cinema. The trend we see today is because of this very reason. People enjoy and encourage watching films that are not just run-of-the-mill. I feel that Ring Master has the vigour and the essence of being that edge-of-the-seat entertainer. This film has given me the opportunity to try out something new, something that satisfies me as an actor. I am so convinced about this film that even though we shot for 32 days, and worked on the set design, the costumes and even sung a song, I have not taken any payment for my work here. I have asked my producers and director to pay me only if the film goes on to be successful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:23:00.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
