Share article \nThe Wombats write off-beat songs about love, and it's this quirkiness, coupled with brilliant use of ‘oooos’ in backing vocals, that makes their songs so catchy, whether they are jaunty songs about leaving love and life behind to indulge a drinking habit or falling in love with a poledancer. \nJust ask the crowd, they went home so happy.
