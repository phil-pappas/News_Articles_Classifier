You will not do it again.\"\nHe slams a media report that he ambushed Kardashian outside a California gym, saying he lives in Las Vegas now.\nThe former NBA star and reality TV personality also railed against reports that he's a womanizer and drug addict and touted his accomplishments on the basketball court.\n\"I probably couldn't even get (expletive) hired by Home Depot right now because of how people look at me,\" he says. \"It's over.\"\nOdom was found unconscious Tuesday at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, about 70 miles from Las Vegas.
