The founder of Hand in Hand Parenting is writing a book, financed though a successful $50,000 Indiegogo campaign. With the next $15,000 , Hand in Hand will translate the upcoming book into Spanish, providing Spanish-speaking parents and caregivers, for the first time, a one-stop resource for deepening the connection with their children.\nA close parent-child connection throughout childhood is the strongest factor in preventing social and health problems-involvement in drugs, violence, and unintended pregnancies among them. Hand in Hand furnishes powerful tools for building and repairing the parent-child connection. Giving parents the tools to lift difficulties out of their children's lives will foster generations of emotionally and socially intelligent leaders. Skills to build human connection will make all the difference in this challenging century.\nAs one parent recently said, \"When I discovered Hand in Hand, I had three children. Now, I have a family.\" This book project will ensure English and Spanish speaking parents have easy access to the transformational tools of Hand in Hand Parenting.\nHand in Hand is a registered\n501(c)(3) nonprofit organization\nEIN #77-0234719.\n releases/hand-in-hand-parenting-announces-campaign-to-translate-new-book-into-spanish-300158483.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hand-in-hand-parenting-announces-campaign-to-translate-new-book-into-spanish-300158483.html", "http://igg.me/at/ParentingbyConnectionBook", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF26413&Transmission_Id=201510130930PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF26413&DateId=20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:08:47.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
