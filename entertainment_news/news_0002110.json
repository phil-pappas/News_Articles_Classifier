The exhibit, “Feves Gallery 25th Anniversary: The Legacy Continues,” will feature select pieces of Betty Feves’ work surrounded by the work of artists who apprenticed with her. These artists include Aaron Burgess, Jan Dow, Alice Fossatti, Doug Kaigler, Joel Kaylor, Kyoung Sook Kim, Jim Lavadour and David Waln. An opening reception for the show will be 4:30-6:30 p.m. Nov. 5 at the gallery, located in Pioneer Hall on the Blue Mountain Community College campus, 2411 N.W. Carden Ave. The exhibit runs through Dec. 17. In addition to the special gallery show, the silver anniversary celebration will include the Betty Feves Art Home Tour on Nov. 7 from 1-4 p.m. This self-guided tour of four private collections of Feves’ work in Pendleton will serve as a fundraiser for the Gallery. Tickets are $45 per person and must be purchased by Oct. 28 by calling Gallery Director Lori Sams, 541-278-5952. Betty Feves was born and raised in Walla Walla and settled in Pendleton with her husband, Dr. Louis Feves, in 1945. She began exhibiting her work in 1952, becoming both a nationally and internationally known ceramic artist. Feves was deeply committed to her family, community and work. She was known for her service to the community. Throughout her career she offered one- and two-year apprenticeships in her studio to visual arts. She brought the Suzuki method of strings instruction to the area, taught music to hundreds of local children and served on the Pendleton School Board for 15 years. The Betty Feves Memorial Art Gallery officially opened and was dedicated to Feves on Nov. 25, 1990, five years after her death in 1985. In 1983, the Arts Council of Pendleton raised funds to commission a piece by Feves for the Vert Auditorium, but Feves’ passing came before the piece was complete. The funds raised were instead used as the nucleus to build the Gallery at BMCC in Feves’ memory and to continue the educational tradition she began. The Betty Feves Memorial Art Gallery is open Monday-Thursday from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and by appointment by calling 541-278-5952.
