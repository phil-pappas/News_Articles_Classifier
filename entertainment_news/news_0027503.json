The BBC has been criticised in recent years for choosing an act and song to represent the country – without consulting its many millions of devoted Eurovision fans.\nThis year's band, Electro Velvet, failed to finish in the top 20 acts of 2015 – but even the likes of Bonnie Tyler and Engelbert Humperdinck have struggled to dazzle the continent.\nIt is hoped the X Factor-style talent search, spearheaded by Atomic Kitten and a former record boss, will unearth an up and coming act who is music to Europe's ears.\nAnyone who is aged 18 or over can submit a video of them performing an original track, and the chosen performer will represent the UK at the next contest in May 2016.\n1 / 19 Gallery: Sweden Victorious At Song Competition In Vienna\nSweden's Mans Zelmerlow took the crown with his performance of Heroes\nGraham Norton, who lends his pithy commentary to the competition, said: \"Eurovision is one of the highlights of my year.\n\"The fact that the public gets the final say on who is sent to represent the UK in Stockholm next year is the icing on the cake.\"\nThe UK last won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1997, when Katrina And The Waves performed Love Shine A Light.\n1 / 10 Gallery: 2014: Millions Tune In\nSingers from 26 countries took part in the 59th annual Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen.
