He ends up on the run in England and Scotland, trailed by killers. \nThe play is based on Alfred Hitchcock’s 1935 film of the same name which, in turn, was loosely based on John Buchan’s classic novel. \nThe stage adaptation, by actor and playwright Patrick Barlow, closely follows the film noir style of the Hitchcock movie — with a few Monty Python-esque touches. \nThe four-member cast has to re-create dramatic elements from the film such as car chases, a plane crash and a foot chase on top of a train — all on the stage of Greenville Little Theatre. \n“It’s been great fun from Day 1 of rehearsals,” Bean said. \nTwo of the actors (Sam McCalla and Evan Harris) play about 20 roles each, often switching between characters in the blink of an eye. Those roles include men, women, children and even inanimate objects. \nLaura Sykes, the sole female actor in the play, alternates between three characters: an English ingenue, a Scottish country girl and a German femme fatale. \nBean portrays the leading man Hannay throughout the play. \n“I feel like I have the easiest job,” Bean said. “I only have to play one character.” \nAllen McCalla, the Little Theatre’s executive artistic director, is staging the play. \n“Working with Allen is such a treat because he’s got comedic timing in his blood,” Sykes said. “He knows what will land with the audience.” \n“The 39 Steps” enjoyed long runs both on Broadway and in London’s West End. The London production closed only last month after nine years, making it the fifth longest-running play in West End history. \nThe comedy poses considerable challenges for its four actors: They rarely get a chance to take a break. \n“There are very few moments that any of us are offstage,” Bean said. “In this 100-page script, I may be offstage for about two pages.” \nAll four actors are familiar figures on Greenville stages. Bean, who works in sales at Southern Advertising, averages about four plays a year in Greenville. Sykes, Greenville Little Theatre’s office manager by day, performs about the same number of shows every year as well. \nFor the latest in local arts news and reviews, follow Paul Hyde on Facebook and Twitter: @PaulHyde7 . \nYOU CAN GO \nWhat: “The 39 Steps,” adapted by Patrick Barlow from the film by Alfred Hitchcock and novel by John Buchan \nWhen: 8 p.m. Oct. 30-31, Nov. 5-7 and 12-14; also 3 p.m. Nov. 1 and 8 \nWhere: Greenville Little Theatre, 444 College St. \nTickets: $28, with discounts available for seniors, children and groups of 10 or more \nInformation: 864-233-6238 or www.greenvillelittletheatre.org Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LJ9mJc MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:38:30.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
