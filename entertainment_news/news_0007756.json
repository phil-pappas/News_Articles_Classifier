Coming soon to Seven. June 19th 2015 4 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ \nWHY has 800 Words succeeded where so many other Australian shows have failed? That is the question many people are asking after the runaway success of Channel 7’s new drama. \nThe show is averaging a whopping 1.4 million-plus across the five capital cities once catch-up viewing is added. It is consistently Tuesday night’s number one program and, even more remarkably, usually builds its audience on lead-in show The X Factor. \n800 Words has received generally favourable reviews and there is no denying the quality of the writing as well as the performances from Erik Thomson as George Turner as well as Melinda Vidler as daughter Shay and Benson Jack Anthony as son Arlo.

Here are my five reasons that 800 Words has struck such a chord with Aussie audiences. \n1. The Packed to the Rafters Halo Effect \nPacked to the Rafters is the biggest Aussie TV drama of the last decade and it was still rating strongly when Channel 7 ceased production in 2013 after six seasons. The big question was whether Erik Thomson and Rebecca Gibney could have the same level of success separately as they had teamed as Dave and Julie Rafter. The answer is a resounding ‘yes’. Gibney’s Winter rated strongly earlier this year, particularly once catch-up figures were added in, grabbing well over 1 million viewers across the five capital cities. Now Thomson’s 800 Words has done even better. Former Packed to the Rafters star Jessica Marais’ Love Child is a smash for Nine too. Rafters fans have flocked to all three new shows.
