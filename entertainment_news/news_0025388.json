Among them: 1. Where, O where, is Luke? The most conspicuous absence on the poster, by a long Falcon shot, is Luke Skywalker. Some fans are speculating that Luke will be in exile during much of “Force Awakens,” and that he'll get more screen time in the subsequent films. But of course, speculation is rampant, and even the trailer may not solve much. 2. Where, O where, is Lupita Nyong'o? The Oscar-winning actress will play space pirate Maz Kanata in “TFA.” So ... is that poster's smaller, goggled creature alongside the droids the Maz we're looking for? 3. Is that a new Death Star? Behind John Boyega's Finn, we gaze at that menacing body. Is this the new killer star base we're looking for? 4. Just what menace does that lightsaber of Rey (Daisy Ridley) possess? Rey's saber doesn't look quite like anything we've seen before. Let's hope we get to see it in full, lighted action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:05:40.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
