I wish that I was considered a band or something else.\n\"That word 'singer-songwriter' has taken on a whole new meaning. You know, singer-songwriters in the '60s and '70s, they were like [Bob] Dylan and Jackson Browne and, you know, Joni Mitchell. And people were saying important things — political things, you know?\n\"And now it's just like some blond dude with a guitar who lives on a beach. It's so boring to me. I like to believe that I'm saying things more interesting than just talking about how much I miss my girlfriend or, you know, I'm traveling on the road.\"\nHolden definitely is doing that.\nMore recently, he has gotten attention with more meaty songs such as \"The Lost Boy,\" inspired by his reading Dave Eggers' book \"What is the What\"\" about Sudanese refugees. The song was used as the theme for a Red Cross campaign in Holland, taking it to the top of the charts there, then in a critical scene in the FX Channel television drama \"Sons of Anarchy.\"\n\"Boys in the Street,\" from his major label debut album \"Chase The Sun,\" released in April, became part of a charity album for the group Everyone Is Gay, which supports LGBT youth.\n\"It's like I sort of got bored of those [singer-songwriter] messages and wanted to say something more interesting,\" Holden says. \"Whether or not I'm doing that is totally up to the listener, but that was certainly my goal — to stand out. … For me, it's always been important to say something meaningful and not jump on the bandwagon of what everyone else is talking about.\"\nHolden's entire journey has made him stand out.\nBorn in Scotland and raised in England, he wrote his first song at 18. In 2009, at 26, he self-released his first album, \"A Word in Edgeways,\" and moved to New York. In 2010, using $30,000 in fan donations from a Kickstarter campaign, he released his second disc, \"I Don't Believe You.\"\nBut a lack of success had him ready to quit the music business when, he says, he found himself working with Grammy Award-nominated songwriter-producer Drew Pearson.\n\"And we were like, 'All right, let's write a song today. Who's it for? We don't know.' But I had a friend who was going through a really dark time at the time, and I wanted to write a song that sort of let them know that someone was there for them,\" Holden says.\nHe says they recorded the song that day, and \"I walked away and got on with my life, just like after any other writing session.\"\nSix months later, Holden says, he was \"in the darkest period of my career — I couldn't sustain the things that I was doing. I just wasn't making any money and I was about to quit music. I really was very, very close to giving it all up.\"\nThat was when he got a phone call asking to use the song for Phillip Phillips on \"American Idol.\"\n\"It was a very bizarre moment — because first of all I didn't even know 'American Idol' was even still showing,\" he says with a laugh. \"And, you know, I just didn't know what was going to come from it. But certainly I needed to take that risk because I had nothing else going on.\"\nThe song sold 5 million tracks in the United States alone and became the theme song for the U.S. Olympic gymnastics team in 2012.\nHolden used some of the money to take what he says was \"a life-changing trip\" to India and Nepal.\n\"I just sort of hit a wall with my music and my life and I didn't really know where the next step was, so I was looking for a jolt — something that would sort of throw me off and put me on a new path,\" Holden says. \"I needed something more exciting in my life. So I went on the trip.\"\nHe says, \"It changed my life dramatically, just 'cause I was made aware of how lucky I am to be doing what I'm doing. And I stopped complaining about a lot of things that I used to complain about because everything was just put in perspective.\"\nHolden says he didn't just want to \"have these great experiences and realizations and then keep them to myself, so I really wanted to spread any sort of positive message that I had, or positive reaction that I'd had from that trip with as many people as possible.\"\nThat became the basis for the album \"Chase The Sun,\" which he financed himself, then found a home for it at Warner Bros.\nIn the meantime, he also found success with \"The Lost Boy,\" which raised over $50,000 for the Red Cross.\n\"I had no idea how big the campaign was, but a week later, the song was the No. 1 single in Holland, and I was in Holland, playing it in front of 10,000 people on Christmas Eve, live on TV in front of 11 million people. And the song wasn't even two weeks old yet,\" he says with a laugh.\n\"It was a trip. It was an absolute trip. I was reading the lyrics off a monitor in front of 10,000 people, just absolutely sh-tting myself. That was the first time I ever played it live.\"\nThe song also was licensed to \"Sons of Anarchy,\" where it was featured over the funeral procession of main character Opie Winston. Within two weeks, \"The Lost Boy\" sold 30,000 downloads in the United States and debuted at No. 36 on Billboard's Rock chart.\n\"Which is really crazy, because I didn't know that still happened with TV placements and stuff,\" Holden says. \"And honestly, I have to admit I never watched 'Sons of Anarchy.' So I had no idea how big that show was.\"\n\"Hold On Tight,\" the first single off \"Chase The Sun,\" hit No. 15 on Billboard's Adult Alternative Songs chart, but it has been \"Boys in the Street\" — a look at a father's contentious relationship with his openly gay son — that has been getting more attention.\nHolden, who is straight, says friends of his who are in the group Everyone Is Gay asked him to write a song for its annual fundraising compilation disc.\n\"I didn't want to write a song that I couldn't personally connect with on an experience level, because I really like writing about my own personal experiences,\" he says.\n\"So I have a lot of friends who are gay and who had a hard time growing up because of that. And I also had a really hard time at home with my stepdad for other reasons. So I wanted to write a song that sort of gave a message of acceptance and that could relate to a lot of people.\"\nSomething beyond what a typical singer-songwriter would do.\njohn.moser@mcall.com\nTwitter @johnjmoser\n610-820-6722\n• Info: www.ticketmaster.com , 800-745-3000.\nGREG HOLDEN\nopening for Vintage Trouble\n• When: 8 p.m. Sunday\n• Where: Theatre of Living Arts, 334 South St., Philadelphia\n• How much: $18 general admission\n• Set list: Songs from his new album \"Chasing the Sun,\" such as the single \"Hold On Tight,\" \"Save Yourself\" and \"Bulletproof,\" and his hit \"The Lost Boy\" from television's \"Sons of Anarchy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:32:04.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
