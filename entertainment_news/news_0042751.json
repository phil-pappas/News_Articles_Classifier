He was gasping for air. His eyes were up in the top of his head,\" said PE teacher Alan Nakagama.\nThe school's principal, Dixie Garrison, recalled, \"He wasn't with us. He was gone. He had just dropped down, heart had stopped.\"\nThat's when staff members, including Eric Price, the vice principal, sprung into action and started CPR . Price had been through training just days before.\n\"At that time, the adrenaline just kicks in and you just kinda do what you've been trained to do,\" said Price.\nWith the help of the school resource officer David Hood, Skyler was brought back to life and then rushed to the hospital.\nIt turns out, he was born with a genetic heart defect . According to his mom, Lori Edmunds, he had never had any signs of heart problems and had just had a physical and checked out to be completely healthy.\nSkyler, who said he barely remembers what happened, is set to undergo surgery that will place a defibrillator in his chest.\n\"I feel fortunate and I feel like I get a second chance,\" the middle schooler said from the hospital. \"I'm feeling fine. I'd just like to thank all the people who supported me through this.\"", "external_links": ["http://kutv.com/news/local/two-days-after-taking-cpr-class-local-vice-principal-saves-students-life"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:14:01.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
