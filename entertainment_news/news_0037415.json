The ideal transitional piece that can carry you through from bare legs to 100 denier, they are the item to stock up on in every style and colour. \nThe 1970s trends that have dominated AW15 so far have also brought back the blocky, lower heel, which has often been shunned in the past. Alongside the block there is also the fantastic return of the platform, so the comfort levels of the humble ankle boot are through the roof so you can wear them all day without wincing by 10pm. \nThe simple design is ideal to pair up with everything from a flared jean to midi skirt and can also fit perfectly under a sleek tailored trouser.
