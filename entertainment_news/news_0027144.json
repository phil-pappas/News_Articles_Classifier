As nice as a cheap pizza seems, especially with food prices as high as they are, too cheap and it makes it possible for some entrepreneurs to hatch money-grabbing schemes.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738999", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738999&h=Finnish+police+ask+public+to+report+cheap+pizzas", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738999&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:17:55.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
