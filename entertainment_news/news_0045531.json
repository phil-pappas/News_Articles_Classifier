Scotland Yard's macabre Crime Museum goes on public display A Metropolitan Police wanted poster for Harvey Crippen and his accomplice Ethel Neve, along with a spade said to have been used in the murder of Crippens wife Cora in 1910, form part of the Crime Museum Uncovered exhibition at the Museum of London in the City of London, Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015. Crippen is infamous for being the first criminal to be captured with the aid of wireless telegraphy. Drawn from Scotland Yard's private collection, the show charts more than a century of violence and suffering, from the murders of Jack the Ripper to IRA and al-Qaida bombings. But it also celebrates the brains, bravery and scientific advances that helped catch perpetrators and solve crimes.
