(BBC/Screenshot) \nNot only did we ponder whether there was any possibility he could’ve had blood ties to the former leader of the Liberal Democrats leader, but maybe the musical twin brothers Charlie and Craig Reid too? \"Hello, I'm Charlie Clegg, I'm from Glasgow, and I'm one half of The Proclaimers\". #UniversityChallenge \n— David Ephgrave (@David_Ephgrave) October 12, 2015 Clegg is a body double for one of the Proclaimers #universitychallenge \nWell they are Scottish too, after all… The Proclaimers had a son? #universitychallenge #clegg \nSoon came the moment that had us spluttering out mouthfuls of tea into our cups… We’d like to elaborate, but this video clip pretty much speaks for itself. They're loud, those buzzers (watch to the end) #universitychallenge pic.twitter.com/hN68ALHE13 \n— Nick Thornsby (@NickThornsby) October 12, 2015 \nAssuming Charlie had tuned into University Challenge only hundreds of times, one could only guess he’d have been mentally prepared for the sound of the buzzer. Turns out he wasn’t. Wow, he really jumped out of his seat, when the person next to him pressed their buzzer! #universitychallenge \n— Em Preece (@EmmaPreece1) October 12, 2015 Shoutout to Clegg for being scared of his team mates buzzer… We saw you #universitychallenge \n— Tom Whitney (@Seasick_Tom) October 12, 2015 Clegg looking at his buzzer like it wasn't supposed to buzz #universitychallenge \n— Uni Challenge Faces (@UnichallengeF) October 12, 2015 \nAnd you’d think after a couple buzzes or so, the Oxford student would’ve been at ease with the screeching noise, but you’d be mistaken. \nThroughout the remainder of the 30 minute show, poor Charlie couldn’t help but look like a startled deer in the headlights every time his team mates slammed their hands down. Clegg jumping every time the buzzer rings – That's comedy gold in #universitychallenge \n— The Guy Next Door (@guy_in_london) October 12, 2015 #universitychallenge Harries! You're gonna have to stop buzzing before you give old Clegg a myocardial infarction! \n— Angela Roberts (@AngelaRoberts2) October 12, 2015 Share article \nCharlie and his team thrashed their opponents by 130 points (despite his fear of the buzzer), storming into round two.
