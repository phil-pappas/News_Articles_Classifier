The reimagined Playboy magazine will include a completely modern editorial and design approach, and, for the first time in its history, will no longer feature nudity in its pages. Playboy will continue to publish sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women, including its iconic Playmates, all shot by some of today's most renowned photographers. The magazine will also remain committed to its award-winning mix of long-form journalism, interviews and fiction.\n\"The political and sexual climate of 1953, the year Hugh Hefner introduced Playboy to the world, bears almost no resemblance to today,\" said Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders . \"We are more free to express ourselves politically, sexually and culturally today, and that's in large part thanks to Hef's heroic mission to expand those freedoms. We will stay true to those core values with this new vision of Playboy 's future. Once our readers see all of the innovative changes we're making to the magazine, we're confident they will love the end product when it debuts next year.\"\nThe transformation of Playboy magazine is being led by the company's Chief Content Officer Cory Jones , the creative force behind Playboy.com's relaunch; Editorial Director Jason Buhrmester ; Creative Director Mac Lewis ; and Neville Wakefield , a past Playboy creative contributor and \"the art world's go-to guy,\" as described by The New York Times .\nAs part of the redesign, the magazine will feature a larger size (an increase to 9\" x 11\") and will be printed on heavier, higher quality paper to give the magazine a more collectible feel. More details about Playboy's redesign will be announced in the coming months.\nWith its website, mobile app, massive social media fan base and magazine, Playboy reaches more people now than ever before in its 62 year history. Relaunched in August of 2014 as a safe-for-work site, Playboy.com immediately experienced explosive growth in its audience, averaging a 400% increase in monthly unique visitors. In addition, the median age of the site's visitors shrank from 47 to 30 years of age, an attractive demographic for advertisers. About a third of all visitors to Playboy.com return to the site every day.\nAbout Playboy Enterprises, Inc.\nPlayboy is one of the most recognized and popular consumer brands in the world.
