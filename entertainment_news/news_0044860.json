You will continue to write for the love you have for the songs, the music and the writing process, and sometimes knowing how good you are is enough. I really do want to share my music with the world and these songs deserve to be heard.\"\n\"Johnny and I have a very unique way of writing together. If you are familiar with the writing process of Elton John and writing partner Bernie Taupin, ours is the exact opposite. Bernie would give Elton lyrics then Elton would add the music. With us, Johnny sends me the music and I add the lyrics. We have been working together 18 years and it still works. The song 'Broken' came to me at a very hard time in my life. My wife and I were breaking up. The lyrics were written 20 minutes after I got the music from Johnny. This song has always been a fan favorite. Now with the new video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uuFllpW6DQ ) it is receiving a whole new audience and numerous views.\"\nThe EP 'In Time' is available now at iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-time-ep/id898111906\nKaveh, George Domiano and Johnny Bower Offical Website:\nhttp://www.bignoisenow.com/kaveh.html", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uuFllpW6DQ", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-time-ep/id898111906", "http://www.bignoisenow.com/kaveh.html"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:58:27.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
