In fact, he admitted in a videotaped deposition that he was drunk and high on Vicodin when he promoted his records in 2013. \"Blurred Lines\" was one of the most popular songs in 2013 but Thicke was accused of ripping off Marvin Gaye 's \"Got to Give It Up\". In March this year, a jury awarded the Gaye estate $7.3 million, which was later reduced to $5.4 million. Thicke and Williams are in the process of moving forward with an appeal to argue that there were improper legal decisions that led to the jury's verdict. THR obtained videos of the key deposition in the case that capture both Thicke and song's co-writer Pharrell Williams . \"Were you drunk and on Vicodin when you did the Oprah show?\" Gaye estate's lawyer Richard Busch asked. Thicke said, \"Yes.\" He went on, \"With all due respect, I was high and drunk every time I did an interview last year.\" When asked whether he considered himself an honest person, Thicke answered, \"No.\" He continued explaining, \"When I give interviews, I tell whatever I want to say to help sell records.\" Meanwhile, excerpts from Williams' deposition shows how the \"Happy\" crooner kept saying he was not \"comfortable\" to most of the questions. Appearing defensive, he said, \"I'm not here to teach you music\" when asked what blue chords are. He was pressed to answer and finally replied, \"I don't know.\" Williams said he could read notes but not write one. When asked to name two notes, he told the lawyer, \"I can't answer you at this time.\" He was later reminded of an interview in which he talked about Gaye. \"I did not go in the studio with the intention of making anything feel like, or to sound like, Marvin Gaye,\" Williams said. The lawyer pressed on the issue, asking \"When you were creating Blurred Lines, were you trying to pretend that you were Marvin Gaye?\" Williams answered, \"At that particular time, no. But as I look back, I feel that feeling.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:52:41.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
