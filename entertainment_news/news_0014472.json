They’ll be able to present and promote their work, sell or auction their artworks, participate to international contest in order to collaborate with brands or companies and offer a chance for students to get a prestigious scholarship to guarantee their success in school.\nArtchyls allows art lovers to meet artists, search information, discover museums or galleries in cities they visit and localize artworks around them. From a simple graffiti to a monumental sculpture, they’ll be able to recognize any artist by taking a picture with their smartphone.\nWe don’t forget anyone and that’s why Artchyls thought about diversified features also for museums and galleries offering them a place for their introduction, an online ticketing system, a custom local promotion, a GPS system to guide visitors up to their museum/gallery and much more!\nWe also invite collectors and journalists specialized in the domain of art to join the community and use unique professional tools, get a free access to all exhibitions in collaboration with Artchyls and download prewritten press releases of artists.\nHowever, before everyone can enjoy this platform, Artchyls needs help. That’s why we launched this . The goal of this project is to raise $ 100,000 by November 15, 2015. The funds raised will go towards developing and completing the software.\nTo help bring this innovative platform to market, please visit the or click here . Perks will be delivered between November 2015 and December 2016. Artchyls is lucky to collaborate with more than forty well known artists such as Alexandre Deschaumes, Balazs Solti, David Olkarny, GoddoG, Habbenink, Hopnn, Marchal Mithouard (Shaka), Polina Washington, Robert Farkas, SAMINA and many others who are preparing lots of limited artworks as gifts to offer you.\nAny amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Artchyls reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook , Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nView our full presentation on Kickstarter\nFollow us on Facebook\nVisit our website\nHere are our contact details:\nLucas Reiser Jorge Petrov\nCofounder Cofounder\nCEO CEO & Designer\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artchyls/artchyls-bring-the-art-to-the-next-level/", "https://www.facebook.com/artchyls"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:23:21.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
