They were worried that college admissions officers would use the social network to learn more about applicants — and to possibly make judgments against them.\nBut college hopefuls aren't the only ones worried about the sometimes unwitting transparency of social media.\n\"Now, we're much more wary and much less willing to share things with such a public audience,\" says Lin, 23. \"We're very aware of the fact that whatever you post has the potential to be seen by thousands of loose connections\"\nAll of which has inspired the New Jersey native to try to push social media in a new, and slightly less social, direction. Lin — who currently lives in San Francisco — is the co-creator of a new app called Spindle .\nA screenshot of Spindle in action. (Spindle)\n Its goal? To generate a greater sense of privacy and authenticity among digital connections.\n\"Right now on social media, everything seems curated and fake,\" she says, and social media is increasingly a place for social \"performance\" — a way to keep up appearances.\n\"People are really over that age of social media,\" adds Alex Walker, 24, co-creator of the Spindle app.\nSpindle, which is free but currently only available for the iPhone, functions as a social journal or digital scrapbook service, one with less visibility to the outside world than Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Something like texting, except you can more easily locate past communication — what Lin calls \"your best hits.\" (The app Timehop does much the same for content on social media, but such remembrances are curated.)\nRELATED: N.J. team wins $25K prize for robocall killer app The way it works: after downloading the app, users can share Spindle messages with anyone in their phonebook. They can send (or simply journal) text, photos, audio and emoji . The recipient of the message need not have downloaded Spindle to see a text message invite. When that person signs up for Spindle, anything anyone has sent to them on Spindle will already be there.\nWhether you want to share, say, the contents of your weekend with only yourself or a few close friends, you can customize the accessibility of each Spindle story. The default is that Spindle shares the stories only with you, and there is no way to \"friend\" or \"follow\" people. The hope is that users aren't focused so much on the appeal and reach of their shares — how many \"likes\" something gets on Facebook, for example — as they are on just sharing what they want.\nAlex Walker, at left, and Amanda Lin, co-creators of Spindle. (Spindle)\n Walker and Lin say say they aren't trying to reinvent the likes of Facebook and Instagram so much as address the notion that we're filtering ourselves online.\nIn effect, Spindle asks, would we banish our fears of \"oversharing\" — and actually share more — if we were guaranteed that only a select, trusted few were able to see?\n\"We're not going to replace any existing services out there,\" says Lin, who grew up in Piscataway. She attended Rutgers Preparatory School before heading to Stanford University to study symbolic systems. Graduating in 2013, she stayed to earn a master's degree in computer science. While still an undergrad at Stanford, she met Walker. They were both enrolled in the university's Mayfield Fellows Program , which focuses on tech entrepreneurship. The pair began developing Spindle in January and launched the app in September.\nThe mission of Spindle — not to be confused with an identically named discovery app acquired by Twitter in 2013 — is to become \"the single best place to tell all your life stories,\" says Walker, who hails from Denver and studied mechanical engineering at Stanford.\nThe app's tagline: \"Tell it like it is.\"\nSpindle users have the option of keeping a message to themselves or sharing with friends. (Spindle)\n \"Let's all take a deep breath and stop pretending our lives are perfect,\" reads Spindle's download pitch. \"Life's a mess, so find us on the App Store and start remembering it the way it actually happened.\"\nHe and Lin funded Spindle through friends and family, though they say they'll soon be thinking about pursuing other sources of money (they are not disclosing the amount of money they've spent so far on the app).\nPath, an app launched in 2010, had a similar goal to Spindle's, but facilitated sharing among a limited group of up to 150 friends (and got slapped with a fine for allegedly collecting personal information from users' phone address books without their consent).\nSo how will an app that is banking on the power of small groups become profitable?\n\"We have lots of ideas about how we will eventually make money, but none of these ideas are as good as the ones we'll have once we see how people are using Spindle,\" Lin says.\n Amy Kuperinsky may be reached at akuperinsky@njadvancemedia.com .
