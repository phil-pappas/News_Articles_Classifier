Not knowing any humans and fast approaching his coming-of-age, he encounters a force that seeks his mind. Forced to find a solution to his impending doom, Tomas begins a lonely journey. With the help of foundlings he meets along the way, he learns to tap into his abilities as a human and as a power to be reckoned with.\nTomas’ claim for the right to exist is a whisper of things to come on Earth and the thoughts that create them. This engrossing book taps into Balch’s beliefs about the spirituality of the human mind as she aspires the world to be a more caring, nurturing place.\n“The book is different because it stretches the belief structure of current paradigms and issues a challenge for us to change our thinking and the impact we have in our world,” said Balch. “Through attuning with nature, we can learn to attain self-mastery and focus on an amazing future.”\nWritten as a futuristic tale, “Tomas of Terra” is a complex story with rich, memorable characters and an imaginative plot that can be read at many levels and will appeal to both children and adults alike.\n“Tomas of Terra: Mastery of Tomas Series”\nBy Jaylee Balch\nISBN: 978-1-4990-0192\nSoftcover retail price: $32.25\nHardcover retail price: $48.38\nE-book: $6.99\nAvailable online at Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Xlibris\nAbout the author\nJaylee Balch was inspired 20 years ago to pursue a path of self-development and to discover the depth of human affairs.
