(Photo: Joan Marcus)\n3 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW YORK -- The particularly brutal ways in which women suffer during war could never be sufficiently documented, but the subject hasn't escaped the notice of playwrights in recent years. A standout example would be Lynn Nottage's Ruined , a Pulitzer Prize winner in 2009 for its darkly lyrical portrait of sexual violence and its fallout in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nDanai Gurira's harrowing, hypnotic Eclipsed (***1/2 out of four stars), which opened Wednesday off-Broadway at the Public Theater, is set around the same time and on the same continent, albeit many miles away. It's 2003, and as the former insurgent and future war-crimes convict Charles Taylor reigns over Liberia, opposing forces terrorize civilians and seize young girls from their families.\nWe meet three women in a ravaged shelter serving as a rebel army camp base. They are the \"wives\" of a commanding officer, and identify themselves in order of acquisition, as Nos. 1, 2 and 4. (No. 3 has fled to join the fighting herself, but will turn up later.) Their names will be revealed, except for No. 4, who in the program is listed simply as \"The Girl.\" She is played by Lupita Nyong'o, the stunning actress who earned an Academy Award last year for portraying a similarly unfortunate young woman in 12 Years a Slave .\nNyong'o, a Yale School of Drama alumna, may be the main attraction for celeb watchers (though fans of AMC's The Walking Dead also know Gurira for her work onscreen). But Eclipsed is by no means a star vehicle: The five characters in this play, all female, compel our attention equally, as do the vibrant, nuanced performances delivered under Liesl Tommy's muscular but tender direction.\nLupita Nyong'o, left. and Zainab Jah appear in Public Theater's production of the new play 'Eclipsed.' (Photo: Joan Marcus)\nThe Girl evolves the most, allowing Nyong'o to show more range than she did in her Oscar-winning turn. When we meet her, shortly after she has been kidnapped, she seems as artless as she is frightened. The warlord's first and eldest captive, Helena, and his second, Bessie -- respectively played by Saycon Sengbloh and Pascale Armand, both razor-sharp and heartwrenching -- try to console her when not nipping at each other.\nWe soon learn, however, that The Girl can read. A book detailing Bill Clinton's troubles post-Monica Lewinsky emerges -- an amusing contrivance that gives the three women a chance to bond, and lets Nyong'o reveal glimmers of passion and cunning in her character.\nBut The Girl is still malleable, and desperate, and No. 3, later identified as Maima -- played by a fierce Zainab Jah -- re-enters the picture and preys on these qualities. As The Girl, under Maima's sway, is persuaded to become a fighter herself; Nyong'o shows us to devastating effect how she is transformed (at least nearly) through terror and denial.\nA regal Akosua Busia appears as Rita, a peace activist who tries to appeal to the others' sense of hope. Eclipsed reminds us, though, how dim prospects seem for the women represented here, and for others like them, everywhere.\n3 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1LuHCIa TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LuHCIa&text=Nyong%27o%20makes%20impression%20in%20%27Eclipsed%27&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1LuHCIa", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803465415812213-Eclipsed0082rR.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d572a37199a7482faa88ac4c1477fc25698ff07e/c=163-0-2717-1920&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803465415812213-Eclipsed0082rR.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fb44d94c10e314af1ee8394f955cd2956b5179d/c=163-0-2717-1920&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803467215919291-Eclipsed0349rR.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LuHCIa&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803465415812213-Eclipsed0082rR.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:31:00.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
