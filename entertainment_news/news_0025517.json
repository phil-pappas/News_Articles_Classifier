Even Mark Zuckerberg commented on the official fan page, writing \"this looks amazing. I love Star Wars.\"\nIt didn't take a Jedi to notice that Luke Skywalker was missing from the promo.\nThe ads have focused mainly on new characters such as Daisy Ridley's Rey and John Boyega's Finn. But the clips also have strategically teased out the return of original characters such as Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia.\nMark Hamill's Luke Skywalker is nowhere to be seen - in full at least.\nFans have heard Luke's voice and seen what is presumed to be his gloved hand on R2-D2, but his conspicuous absence from the most recent trailer and the official poster had many Twitter users asking #whereisluke and wondering what that means for his character.\nDirector J.J. Abrams is somewhat notorious for keeping the plots to his films under wraps, and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" has been no different.\nThe 2-minute, 35-second spot debuted during ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" halftime and was made available online immediately after. Overnight ratings for the game show a definite viewing spike during halftime, suggesting that many tuned in solely for the trailer, not the Giants-Eagles game.\nTickets for the \"The Force Awakens,\" out Dec. 18, went on sale earlier Monday, causing sites like Fandango and MovieTickets.com to experience intermittent crashes as a result of demand.\nThe initial fervor has dissipated, though, and sites seemed to be back up and running and getting fans their tickets. AMC theaters are also selling tickets for 39 \"Star Wars\" marathon events, where they will be showing all seven films on Dec. 17.\nSellouts have been reported for many of the Thursday night preview showings of the latest chapter. AMC alone sold out 1,000 shows in less than 12 hours but also noted that there are still nearly 4 million tickets available for opening weekend.\nTicketing sites tend to keep specifics about actual sales secret. MovieTickets.com did reveal, however, that \"The Force Awakens\" had accounted for a whopping 95 percent of sales on the site in 24 hours.\nFandango experienced unprecedented demand for tickets as well. They've already sold eight times as many tickets as they had for their previous record holder, \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\"Movie theaters are continually adding new show times on Fandango to meet the phenomenal demand,\" a Fandango company statement said.\n___\nOnline: www.starwars.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/334746751/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:28:08.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
