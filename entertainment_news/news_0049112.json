CBS is developing a reboot of the 1985 TV series of the same name about a resourceful and ingenious agent who improvises his way out of sticky situation using everyday items like rubber bands, chewing gum and a Swiss Army knife. A logline for the project reads, \"A reimagining of the television series of the same name, following a 20-something MacGyver as he gets recruited into a clandestine organization where he uses his knack for solving problems in unconventional ways to help prevent disasters from happening.\" R. Scott Gemmill (\"JAG\", \" ER \", \" NCIS: Los Angeles \") will pen the script and serve as showrunner. The original series' executive producer Henry Winkler as well as \" Furious 7 \" director James Wan and Michael Clear will executive produce the reboot. Wan is additionally attached to direct the pilot. Wan had previously developed a MacGyver movie in 2012, but it never got off the ground. Earlier this year, he shared his take on the supposed film about young MacGyver, \"I love the concept behind MacGyver, and I love the direction that we were going with it ... My initial concept was I wanted to do a young college MacGyver who went to Boston, one of the great universities, who's really brilliant, right?\" \"He's so smart he could never feel like he fit into a world that is an establishment. So he's always a bit of an outsider. He's very crafty, he's very smart, all kinds of science and mathematics and engineering. I wanted to put my MacGyver story around something like a North by Northwest: He gets blamed for something that he had designed, something really big that's something everyone wanted, and now someone has weaponized it and everyone's coming after him.\" Wan, however, had to give up the project to direct \"Furious 7\". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:25:09.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
