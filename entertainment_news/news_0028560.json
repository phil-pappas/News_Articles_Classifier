Now what if you could bring familiar set pieces from the Pokémon world into real life?\nThat's exactly what Japanese Pokémon fans will get to do as of November 19th, when a real Pokémon Gym opens in Osaka. For the uninitiated, Gyms are an integral part of the game where Pokémon Trainers face off against Gym Leaders, or skilled trainers, to earn badges when they win heated Pokémon battles.\nExcept fans won't be fighting against Pokémon Gym Leaders there. The Pokémon Expo Gym is meant to be an interactive educational experience for kids, where fans can play arcade games, battle and trade with other players, and get downloadable items each visit. Visits can be logged on a special phone app as well as a member's card and stored for special opportunities in the future, like exclusive Pokémon merchandise.\nThe best prizes to win are special versions of Pokémon that can be used in games like Pokémon X, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Omega Ruby , but the real prize is the fact that a place like this will exist. It's time to go one step further and combine this with the upcoming Pokémon Go app and give us a real-world Pokémon League. We're ready.\nh/t Siliconera", "external_links": ["http://www.siliconera.com/2015/10/21/a-real-life-pokmon-gym-is-opening-in-japan-next-month", "http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:15:16.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
