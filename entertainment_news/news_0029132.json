He fought through chemotherapy and radiation; this past March, he celebrated one year cancer-free. \nBut over the summer, Austin relapsed. \n\"So now we have to fight this monster again,\" said his mother, Abby. \"Except this time, he has to have major surgery.\" \nSurgery is coming soon. On this day, Austin did not have to think about it -- because he got to meet his NASCAR idol. \n\"Just thank you so much,\" he told Earnhardt Jr. upon meeting him. \"I'm trying not to tear up about this, but this means a lot. It really does.\" Sep 20, 2015; Joliet, IL, USA; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. (88) pits during the MyAFibRisk.com 400 at Chicagoland Speedway.
