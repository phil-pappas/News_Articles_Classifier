By creating a keepsake that doubles as artful decor, Veuve Clicquot may see more of an interest in this branded content. \nDecorative bubbly The limited-edition prints were inspired by the Rosé Garden, a VIP section, at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic. For consumers who attend the polo match each year, owning an artistic retelling of the memory may be appealing. \nPrints created in partnership with Gray Malin were inspired by Veuve Clicquot’s brand essence. With both brands “sharing a passion for timeless quality and exceptional vision,” the print series aims to delight and inspire while reminding those who see them “to celebrate often and make every day a getaway.” \nThe limited-edition series includes three prints, all of which feature branded imagery. “A Splash of Rosé” shows a number of Veuve Clicquot bottles and rose petals floating in a pool, “Up, Up and Rosé” captures two clusters of pink branded balloons tied to a bouquet of roses as they float away and lastly, “La Vie en Rosé” includes parasols in different shades of pink being held up by unseen individuals with a bottle of the brand’s Champagne set in the center. \nUp, Up and Rosé by Veuve Clicquot and Gray Malin \nPrints begin at $199 and can reach $3,074 depending on size selections and framing options available from Gray Malin. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the series will be donated to the Will Rogers History State Park in Los Angeles, the venue for Veuve Clicquot’s Polo Classic ( see story ). \nLuxury brands often commission artists to interpret their wares. \nFor example, British menswear label Alfred Dunhill showed off its fashions creatively with an Instagram series of commissioned artwork. \n#CuratedByDunhill was published each week, and showed pieces from digital artist Ignasi Monreal. Using Instagram to show surreal interpretations of fashion helped to engage Dunhill’s audience, while showing a more artistic side of practical attire ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:17:13.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
