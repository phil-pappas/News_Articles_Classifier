Speaking at a function to mark the 99th birth anniversary of former RSS and BJP leader Nanaji Deshmukh, he said, “Despite having the most fertile land in the world, India is importing a lot of grain-cereals for many years. We are also the biggest importer of edible oil. \n“We need to reduce our dependency on the global market and make our rural economy self-reliant.” Small-scale industries and self-entrepreneurship is important to achieve employment for all, he said, adding, “Hundred per cent employment is a challenge. India should become a manufacturing hub to achieve this besides encouraging small-scale industries.” \n  12, 2015 12:52 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:57:45.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
