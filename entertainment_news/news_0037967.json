(Dean Lewins / EPA) Christie D'Zurilla Contact Reporter \nJustin Bieber's beast is on the loose -- and he's not happy about it. \nFull-frontal nudes of the pop singer, taken while he was on vacation in Bora Bora with rumored girlfriend Jayde Pierce, were purchased by the New York Daily News, which published them online Wednesday in a slide show online that had the naughty bits, front and back, getting the black bar treatment. \nOf course, the unedited pictures made it online as well, because that's what happens with naked pictures. \nBieber's legal team sent the Daily News a cease-and-desist letter Thursday, alleging that distribution of the unauthorized pictures constitutes a violation of their client's publicity and privacy rights, with a little trademark infringement thrown in for good measure, according to the Hollywood Reporter . A lawsuit has been threatened if the newspaper doesn't comply, THR said. \nBut TMZ speculated that it's unlikely anyone will sue, because it's heard that once the pictures were leaked, the 21-year-old got over his anger because, well, he makes a good impression.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:58:02.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
