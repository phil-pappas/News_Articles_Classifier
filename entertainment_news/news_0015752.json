The famous Urdu poet and famous Bollywood lyricist came out in open and slammed the government for failing to control the rising intolerance against caste and religion. He also sought a full stop to the politics being played in the name of recent killing, including one in Dadri, another in Faridabad and on the assassination of late Prof MM Kalburgi. \nReacting on the prevailing situation of disharmony in the nation, due to which more than 35 writers and poets have returned their Sahitya Akademi awards as a protest, Gulzar said that earlier people were not asked their religion before they were asked their name. He said, “Pehle aisa mahoul toh nahii tha ki naam sey pehle dharam poocha jaata tha.” Gulzar was seen concerned and said that he is dissatisfied with the prevailing disharmony in the nation.

But his dissent over the politics remains intact. He said, “Ab kahan lautaye jaa rahe hain? Ye humare Akademi kay awards the, unko return karna ek protest thaa.” He also said that writers are peaceful people who are busy in their writing and have no time to play politics, so allegation on them are false. The poet said, “Writer kya raajneeti karega bechara, woh to bas dil ki baat keh raha hai, zameer ki baat kar raha hai. Writers are the conscience keepers of the society, woh samaaj kay zameer ko sambhalne wale log hain .” \nTaking a jibe at the people playing politics over the communal matters, he commented on ‘Ram Rajya’ that he would be glad to meet the communal forces who met ‘Ram’, because he can not see the ‘Ram Rajya’ (ideal state). Gulzar said, “Mujhe acha lagega unse milke jinko ‘Ram rajya’ mil gaya hai, aapko dikh raha hai?” However, he also said there is no fault of the Sahitya Akademi in the rising intolerance in the country, so putting the entire blame on it would also be not correct.
