The restaurant is highly ranked on TripAdvisor within the Tysons community and the team is excited to announce the newly designed menu along with added features and offering.\n“Because of such a large regular following, we feel it’s important to constantly add new offerings to our menu,” said Chef Sam El-Sheikh. “Our guests are always excited to see something new to try.” For starters, what was an all-day menu in the past, Brix And Ale will now offer separate lunch and dinner menus, creating a masterful selection of dining options for each meal period. These menus clearly capture Chef Sam’s talents while diversifying options for our guests. Starting with lunch, the chef focuses on a healthy gluten free favorite with the Cajun Salmon Salad served with mixed greens, blueberries, cashews, red raspberries, tomato and a light citrus vinaigrette. The new lunch menu provides many salad options, an abundance of burger and sandwich selections and main course options including Tagliatelle Pasta Bolognese and Angus Beef NY Strip.\nWhile the lunch menu is an exciting change, the dinner menu will truly take guests to a happy place when it comes to enjoying great food, great wine and great company. Chef Sam presents one of his favorites; Day Boat Scallops served with Butternut Squash and Ginger Apple Butter, another gluten free option and already a fan favorite. For the land lovers, the chef prepares a succulent Grilled Half Roasted Chicken or the ever- popular Flame Grilled Cowboy-Cut Black Angus Rib Eye.\nIn addition to the new lunch and dinner menu, Brix And Ale boasts a new breakfast buffet, a new cocktail and shared bites menu (Starwood’s Paired Program) and made to order fresh sushi options by Sushi Chef J. Kim. These enhancements are all part of the Brix And Ale team’s desire to improve the guest experience within the already well-known restaurant. These additions look to delight the domestic and international traveler as well as the business and leisure traveler who frequent Sheraton Tysons Hotel and the Tysons neighborhood.
