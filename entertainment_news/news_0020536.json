The NBA-star-turned-reality-TV-headliner, who turns 36 on Nov. 6, checked out of a Las Vegas hospital Monday, and his family reported yesterday that he's taken a few steps.\nOdom was found unconscious in a rural Nevada brothel on Oct. 13 - the climax, if you will, of a reported $75,000, four-day, sex-booze-and-drugs bender that included two women, alcohol, a supplement dubbed \"herbal Viagra\" and, according to one of the unidentified hookers, cocaine.\nAccording to Alvina Alston , publicist for Odom's aunt, JaNean Mercer , Odom left Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Vegas by helicopter on Monday evening. He is believed to be in a Los Angeles-area medical facility where, according to a statement released by his family, he is making \"miraculous progress.\"\nThe family also thanked the hospital staff and fans for their care and good wishes and indicated that Odom is with his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian , his father and his two children from a previous relationship.\nPenn-Madonna: The sequel More coverage Kevin Hart defended by manager over strip club scuffle Sandra Bullock weighs in on equal pay issue Is a Sean Penn - Madonna recoupling in the works?\nIt seems the two uber-A-listers, who were married from 1985 to 1989, have recently been seen out and about in L.A. and environs.\nDylan Penn , Sean's 24-year-old daughter by his ex-wife, \"House of Cards\" star Robin Wright , stopped by \"Access Hollywood Live\" to beat the drum for \"Condemned,\" a thriller she's in that opens nationwide Nov. 13. During her face time with take-no-prisoners inquisitors Billy Bush and Kit Hoover , Dylan spoke of going with her dad to a recent Madonna concert.\n\"I've always wanted to meet her,\" Dylan told the hosts. \"I mean, it's Madonna. Who doesn't? But it was so interesting to go with my dad because they're still really good friends, and I just was like watching him watch her, and he's just beaming the entire time. Like it's so funny. When they were my age they were married! It's bizarre!\"\nHoover then noted that both the Oscar-glomming actor and the Material Senior Citizen are eligible singles (Penn divorced Wright in 2010).\n\"Who knows?\" Dylan replied with a laugh. \"Yeah, I'm bringing them back together.\"\nBut the young actress sang a different tune on \"Entertainment Tonight\" when the subject was broached.\n\"I think he just really admires her work,\" she said on Monday's edition of the show. \"They're just really good friends and [I think] it's sweet that they can have this relationship.\"\nTHAT'S TATT * Hosting the Oscars seems a pretty thankless gig to us, but having done it once, in 2005, apparently hasn't discouraged Chris Rock from considering a return for the 88th Academy Awards on Feb. 28, according to Variety , which says an official announcement should come soon.\nThe comedian has worked with new Oscar co-producer Reginald Hudlin , who directed the pilot of Rock's popular, but now canceled, TV series, \"Everybody Hates Chris.\"\n* Emily Jillette , wife of Penn Jillette , of Penn & Teller fame, is being hailed as a hero after she helped rescue a badly injured surfer in Hawaii.\nMrs. J, in Hawaii last weekend for a golf tourney, was walking the beach when she came upon the surfer, whose head and face were covered with blood. She notified authorities and the unidentified man's wife by phone. No word on the man's condition.\n* Actor James Woods (\"Casino,\" \"The Onion Field\") is obviously no fan of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders . Responding via Twitter to a Sanders tweet about Chinese women getting 14 weeks of maternity leave, Woods responded: \"China has notoriously killed female infants for population control, you utter moron. #ChinaGendercide.\"\n* In news that should have international geopolitical ramifications for years to come, Sandra Bullock revealed to \"Extra\" that her 5-year-old son, Louis , prefers his mom as a brunette. She went blond for her new flick, \"Crisis Is Our Brand,\" which opens Oct. 30.\n- Daily News wire services contributed to this report.
