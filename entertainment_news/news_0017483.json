Advertisement \n\"I've dated people like you before, and you give them the benefit of the time and every time the same thing happens. \n\"I'm not used to this sense of pressure,\" Davey admitted. \"I can't bulls--- to you, but I am here for all the right reasons. Every part of me wants to be here.\" \nDavey began the show well with a carnival win. \nMoments later the news of Davey's departure was broken to the other men and the rose ceremony was cancelled. \nThe episode began with a group date. Alex, Sasha, Dave, Davey and Michael were invited into a carnival-themed showdown for some more solo time with Frost, a 26-year-old marketing professional from Victoria. \n\"I will crawl over your dead bodies to win this,\" said Michael. \nDave (not Davey) won the group date at the carnival. \nActivities included Thunder God, a test of brute strength in which Davey reigned supreme. \n\"Davey is being quite the boy's boy today which I can't say I'm surprised, but I can't help wonder if that was just a brief encounter\" Sam observed. \nBy the fifth and final round only Dave and Davey were left standing. Thirty-year-old NSW plumber Dave won the battle, sharing a drink with Sam under the carnival big top. \nRichie breaks down recalling the timewarp date. \nThe date ended in a hug. \nLater in the episode, Sam took 30-year-old Richie Strahan on a single date that could only happen on reality television. \nSpecial effects transformed the pair into a couple in their 80s who were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. \nRichie and Sam on their way to a lawnbowls date. \n\"This is a very unusual date, it's very quirky,\" said Richie who travelled to a local lawn bowls club for bingo and dancing. \nThe date was a huge success. \n\"She's definitely someone I can have a long future with and most of all just be really happy,\" Richie said. \nRichie and Sam watch a video message from his mother and sister. \nSam said \"no guy has ever made me laugh as much as Richie has. I feel like I'm the only girl in the world and that's what everyone dreams for\". \nThe pair also bonded over having divorced parents and how that has stunted their ability to imagine longevity in relationships. \n\"I guess I've been so scared of thinking in this day and age that people can't have long term marriages,\" Sam said. \nThe date ended with a video message from Richie's mum and sister, sharing stories from his childhood and youth, a kiss and Richie receiving a rose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:19:35.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
