Podesta, class of '71 and chairman of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign. He is one of hundreds of donors who pitched in more than $12 million to pay for the recent restoration of the long-crumbling and closed campus building.\nThe gift from Podesta, a longtime Washington political operative, is memorialized on a plaque the size of a paperback novel set just above a light switch in a room that doesn't generate much foot traffic.\nNow compare that with the reception Northwestern University gave the other day to venture capitalist billionaire J.B. Pritzker after he shelled out $100 million to the law school where he studied. Pritzker, who by coincidence co-chaired Clinton's 2008 presidential run, got much more than a plaque and a thank you: He got the school itself, henceforth to be known as Northwestern's Pritzker School of Law.\nIt's no shock that the lifestyles of the rich and famous are more lavish than yours or mine. Even their philanthropy, it seems, gets served with a heaping side order of vanity.\n\"Whatever happened to anonymous giving?\" scholar Pablo Eisenberg lamented in a column in The Chronicle of Philanthropy headlined \"Stop Appealing to Billionaire Egos With Naming Rights.\" Eisenberg, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership, complained that big nonprofits seemed increasingly willing \"to do anything for a buck.\"\nThat outburst was prompted by the news earlier this year that New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts was renaming its Avery Fisher Hall in honor of entertainment mogul David Geffen. The back story is that the famous venue began life in the 1960s as Philharmonic Hall, then was renamed for sound equipment maker Fisher when he helped bankroll renovations a decade later.\nTo fund another overhaul, Lincoln Center's board paid Fisher's heirs $15 million for permission to drop his name and then Geffen stepped in with an offer to foot $100 million of the estimated $500 million in rehab costs.\nGiving back is unquestionably admirable. The question is whether the nobility of such gestures is diminished when the beneficence comes attached to the nonprofit equivalent of a bright spotlight likely to shine after the giver is long gone.\nTo be sure, this is far from a new phenomenon. Chicago has its Field Museum of Natural History, named for department store magnate Marshall Field, who provided the initial seed money in the late 19th century. A big gift from a later leader of Field's retail empire, John G. Shedd, jump-started the aquarium that still bears his name.\nBut what once was occasional is becoming ever more commonplace. If you're still not convinced, then consider the news out of financially struggling Paul Smith's College in upstate New York, a 1,000-student school in the Adirondacks known for its conservation programs.\nAbout the same time Northwestern rebranded its freshly endowed law school, officials at Paul Smith's acknowledged that Wall Street billionaire Sanford Weill had withdrawn a $20 million gift because a judge ruled that the school could not be renamed for Weill's wife.\nAt the risk of sounding a little Bernie Sanders-ish, a sizable amount of total charitable donations come from a middle class conditioned to expect little more than a good feeling, maybe a small tax deduction and a barrage of emails and dinnertime phone solicitations asking for still more. Praise be to caller ID.\nFor those with deeper pockets, the potential is greater for longer-lasting gratification. For instance, the website of American University in the nation's capital sketches out a naming opportunity price list.\n\"In addition to the satisfaction that comes from changing the lives of students, donors can choose to name scholarships, programs, faculty positions, and spaces after themselves or loved ones,\" it declares. \"Naming gifts generally range from $10,000 to $10 million for spaces and buildings, and $50,000 and more for endowments that will honor a donor in perpetuity.\"\nOccasionally, big bucks donations may seem, to some, to produce incongruous results. Dozens of scientists complained to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History this year about its association with David Koch, the billionaire conservative political activist and climate change skeptic.\nKoch has given tens of millions of dollars in financial support to the Smithsonian for an exhibit on dinosaurs as well as another that bears his name, the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins.\nNot to pick on Northwestern (OK, maybe a little), but its business school includes a Zell Center for Risk Research named for real estate tycoon Sam Zell. That is the same Sam Zell who turned the company that once owned this news organization into a kind of risk research lab rat with a financially shaky buyout deal that quickly led to bankruptcy and an array of lawsuits.\nToday's big-bucks philanthropy can sometimes trump, or at least tweak, yesterday's grand traditions.\nFew alums have been more crucial to venerable Dartmouth College in New Hampshire than Daniel Webster, the famous statesman and orator who two centuries ago all but single-handedly prevented the state from taking over the private Ivy League school. Webster Hall was long a prominent concert and assembly venue on campus.\nThen in the 1990s, the aging structure was overhauled and the name altered to play up the project's largest donor, Bruce Rauner, the private equity investor and Dartmouth graduate who this year became Illinois' governor. It is now known as the Rauner Special Collections Library at Webster Hall, and the Rauner name also adorns a Dartmouth dormitory, scholarships and an endowed professorship.\nRauner made his philanthropy a big part of his campaign pitch last year, regularly reciting for audiences a list of Chicago-area projects he has helped fund. Many bear his name. There's a Rauner charter high school, a Rauner YMCA and a Rauner regional headquarters for the American Red Cross, to name a few.\nAll of which is nothing to sniff at, except for this: Many of today's big donors, especially those from the go-go hedge fund and private equity industries, gained a big chunk of their wealth through aggressive use of tax-reducing strategies often out of reach for those of more modest means.\nWhen they get honored for giving away tens of millions of dollars, perhaps the rest of the taxpayers of the United States deserve at least an attaboy.\nThen again, the Carried Interest Loophole School of Law doesn't have quite the ring to it.\nbsecter@tribpub.com\n Colleges and Universities Education Northwestern University Sam Zell Dartmouth College David Koch American Red Cross", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e70c1/turbine/ct-donations-naming-rights-secter-20151026"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:15:21.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
