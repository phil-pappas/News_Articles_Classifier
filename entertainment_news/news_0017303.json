But as long as you're surrounded by people who are supportive of your healthy living and wellness goals, the disparity can actually help. You might be pushed to your limits, and you'll learn new skills.\nExperience New Classes\nGroup exercise can be intimidating, especially when it involves new types of equipment or movements. Yet new options (Fasano mentioned offerings such as TRX Suspension training , Les Mills' GRIT , Zumba, and BodyPump) can be the best way to establish a routine that will stay interesting. Attending with a buddy can ease some of the sense of intimidation, providing some confidence and encouragement when you need it most.\nCreate and Reinforce Healthy Habits\nHealthy activities and behaviors don't need to end once your workout does. When you're socializing with your workout buddy, you can help each other maintain positive behaviors by expanding them beyond your fitness facility. Create a well-rounded, balanced lifestyle by choosing healthy, fresh foods and fun activities. And don't forget to reward yourself in a motivational way for all your hard work.\nCelebrate Small and Large Successes Together\nDid you increase your squat weight, improve your run time, or complete your first pull-up? Your workout buddy will share your excitement and sense of achievement, whether small or large, knowing how hard you pushed to achieve your goal.\nVice president for Healthy Living (Photo: .)\nLaura Fasano has been with the YMCA of Greater Rochester for the past 25 years. As vice president for Healthy Living, she is responsible for leading program development, quality standards and program training, with a primary focus on health innovation. She is leading the YMCA of Greater Rochester in its new phase of health initiatives that include chronic-disease prevention and strategic partnerships in the Rochester community.\nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor, the YMCA of Greater Rochester .", "external_links": ["http://rochesterymca.org/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fdbf86c328c32c0c20791d2180f1f692b345e441/c=0-133-1600-2266&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/21/Rochester/Rochester/635784440222190687-Laura-Fasano-headshot.jpg", "http://rochesterymca.org/trx", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/09/21/Rochester/Rochester/635784440222190687-Laura-Fasano-headshot.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/21/Rochester/Rochester/635784440222190687-Laura-Fasano-headshot.jpg", "http://rochesterymca.org/grit"], "published": "2015-09-28T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:10:35.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
