Share on Facebook zoom CHRIS LARGE / FX FILE PHOTO Billy Bob Thornton created the baddest, best TV new villain in ages in Season 2 of Fargo. By: Adam Proteau Special to the Star, Published on Fri Oct 02 2015 Photos View photos zoom Of the increasing number of TV series based on movies — think previous forays 12 Monkeys and The Transporter ; Minority Report and Limitless , which arrived just last week; Uncle Buck , Rush Hour and The Notebook , still to come — most are in all likelihood destined for history’s scrap heap. There they will join previous failures such as Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles , Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventures , and Casablanca . (Yes, someone tried to remake Casablanca . Let’s just move on.) And then there’s Calgary-produced Fargo , whose second season premieres Monday, Oct. 12 on FX Canada, which proves remakes needn’t stay lockstep loyal to the original content to work. When it debuted in April 2014, the TV version had much to live up to. Its framework was the 1996 film, directed by the legendary Coen Brothers, that landed nominations for the Palme d’Or at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Picture. Actors Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare crafted iconic characters. You could see why some were skeptical when showrunner Noah Hawley sold FX on a 10-episode first season. How could anyone improve on a story flawlessly told? To his credit, Hawley recognized he couldn’t. He retained the fictional geography (Calgary again stands in for Minnesota and, this year, South Dakota) and the bleak minimalism from the original, but rather than incorporating Fargo movie character into his series, he spliced DNA from the film’s central roles into characters telling an entirely new tale. No Fargo TV character had the same name, nor the same fate, as any from the film. So while the brilliant Martin Freeman took some general cues from Macy’s weaselly Jerry Lundegaard character, he infused his Lester Nygaard with more doses of sleaze and slither. Similarly, newcomer Allison Tolman’s portrayal of dogged cop Molly Solverson clearly linked to McDormand’s police chief Marge Gunderson, but there were distinct differences between them. Season 1 had a familiarity to viewers, but not so much that the audience was bored. Besides rejigged links to the source material, Hawley employed elements in Season 1 that were nowhere to be found in the Coen Bros’ work. He brought in an impressive supporting cast (including Colin Hanks, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Keith Carradine and comedy geniuses Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele), all of whom had moments to shine. And, most importantly, he and star Billy Bob Thornton constructed the character of Lorne Malvo: the baddest, best TV new villain in ages. He may have weighed 140 pounds and looked like he was being barely held together by cigarette ash and squinting, but Thornton/Malvo was a menace in every frame in which he appeared. His unforgettable performance forced viewers to put aside their appreciation for the film and instead marvel at what he’d done. Season 2 of Fargo has one link to its past: the anthology’s new plot revolves around Carradine’s fringe character (and Molly’s father) Lou Solverson — only this time, he’s 26 years younger than when we see him in Season 1. He’s played by Watchmen star Patrick Wilson and the rest of Season 2’s cast (including Ted Danson, Jean Smart, Kirsten Dunst and Nick Offerman) are as talented as their predecessors. Fargo ’s first season ended with an Emmy win for Best Miniseries, leaving Season 2 with a high bar to clear. But so long as Hawley can continue blending a dash of the past with a compelling new plot, he can exceed expectations.
