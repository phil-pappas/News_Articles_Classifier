(Photo by Rich Fury/Invision/AP, File) Report an error \nPITTSBURGH -- \"Dance Moms\" star Abby Lee Miller has been charged with hiding $775,000 worth of income from the Lifetime network reality show and spinoff projects during her Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \nFederal prosecutors in Pittsburgh announced the bankruptcy fraud indictment Tuesday against 50-year-old Abigale Lee Miller, formerly of Penn Hills. \nThey say she hid income in 2012 and 2013 from her TV appearances as well as from dance sessions, merchandise and apparel sales. \nAccording to the indictment, the owner of Abby Lee Dance Company gained favourable terms to restructure her debts by concealing the income. \nThe indictment says the scheme might not have been uncovered if the bankruptcy judge hadn't seen her on TV while channel surfing. \nMiller's bankruptcy and defence attorneys didn't immediately return calls Wednesday.
