Get to Know Her Here! Comment Subscribe to Newsletter! \nMarvel is again on track of providing its fans something interesting in the years to come. \nWith Hugh Jackman already decided to bow from his Wolverine alter ego after \"Wolverine 3,\" many fans are eagerly waiting from Marvel on what could be next on their most famous X-Men mutant. Nonetheless, a recent report by Yahoo has just given fans a glimpse of what is coming for \"Wolverine.\" Like Us on Facebook \nAccording to the report by Yahoo, Marvel has unveiled a female version of the popular hero that will be featured in their comic-book spin-off entitled \"All-New Wolverine.\" \nThe character, whose name is Laura Kinney, will follow the heroic path taken by Logan a.k.a Wolverine who is already dead in the comics. \n\"Logan may have fallen, but Laura will honor his memory by taking up the mantle and following in his footsteps as a hero. And she'll stop at nothing to protect those around her from the forces of evil. She's the best there is at what she does. She is the All-New Wolverine! And her story is just getting started,\" Marvel said in a press release. \nAs described by Marvel, Laura Kinney , formerly known as X-23, is a mutant cloned by Dr. Sarah Kinney from Wolverine's damaged \"genetic sample.\" As a result of the top-secret program that aimed to create the Weapon X that is supposed to be Wolverine, Kinney lived in captivity and trained to become an unstoppable assassin. \nHowever, in a turn of tragic events, Laura found herself crossing paths with Wolverine and the X-Men which then led her to join Professor X's Xavier Institute where she became a daughter-like figure to Logan/Wolverine. \nThe introduction of the Female Wolverine is part of Marvel's \"All-New All-Different\" campaign which also features heroes such as a Female Thor (Jane Foster), a Muslim-American Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), a now-female Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), a half-African-American, half-latino Spider-Man (Miles Morales) and a new Captain America played by the former Falcon character (Sam Wilson). \n\"Time and again, I've heard it said that the quality that makes a comic a Marvel comic is that it reflects the world outside your window. So, naturally, as the audience for Marvel comics has grown and diversified, the comics themselves have evolved to follow suit,\" Marvel editor Daniel Ketchum told Yahoo. \nWritten by Tom Taylor with art by David Lopez and David Navarrot, the \"All-New Wolverine #1\" will hit the market this coming November 11, 2015. \nHere's a glimpse of Laura Kinney a.k.a The Female Wolverine.
