Occasionally you see her running in front of a mysterious guy, pulling him around by the hand. Maybe she's, you know, running away with him?\n Then, text message bubbles pop up, presumably between you and your BFF Carly. The emoji you respond with dictates the next shot in the video, whether it's a location, activity, or choice of hat. The result is totally adorable and will get the song stuck in your head for the bajillionth time. Don't say I didn't warn you.\nGIF Share Tweet Pin E-mail Carlyraemusic.com Follow Megan on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/megancarol", "https://stage.interlude.fm/carly_rae/embed.html?publisherID=6EkFo4", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x364/placeholder_gallery-1445628546-carly2.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/placeholder_1445628546-carly2.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445628546-carly2.gif", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x364/gallery-1445628546-carly2.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:26:20.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
