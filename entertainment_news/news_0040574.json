Hoehn Motors recently secured clearance from the city of Temecula to build a dealership next to Mercedes-Benz dealership. ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » HIRING INFO Anyone interested in a position at the Audi dealership can use the careers section of the Hoehn Motors website to submit an application.\nThe company also is planning to launch a website next year that will have hiring information and a construction Web cam.\nThe Mercedes-Benz dealership in Temecula is getting a next-door neighbor.\nThe Planning Commission this week signed off on the specifications for a 37,500-square-foot Hoehn Motors Audi dealership that is slated for land directly south of the Mercedes-Benz of Temecula-Fletcher Jones dealership.\nJosh Sherman, Hoehn’s marketing director, said Friday that Temecula has been on the company’s radar for the last 5 to 7 years and it has been tracking the performance of the new Mercedes dealership, which opened last year.\n“That Mercedes store is doing just fine,” he said. “We’re bullish on the Temecula area.”\nThe commission’s action is final, pending any appeal, because the land, vacant acreage in the northern reaches of the Ynez Road coridor, is already zoned for commercial space.\nThis will be the first Riverside County dealership for Hoehn Motors, a longtime fixture in the San Diego County city of Carlsbad that sells numerous luxury brands. The commission’s vote was 3-0, with Commissioner Ron Guerriero absent.\nCommissioner Gary Youmans said Friday the design for the building is striking, a modern structure that should complement the steel and glass Mercedes-Benz structure to the north.\n“They did a really good job,” he said. “It’s a beautiful project.”\nArea residents who live in Harveston, a large community to the east, were briefed on the project during two community meetings, one in March and another in August.\nThe main concern expressed during those gatherings was the traffic the dealership will generate and some argued for a traffic light at the corner of Ynez Road and Temecula Center Drive, which will service both Mercedes and Audi.\nAn environmental consultant and public works staff members studied the traffic issue and Youmans said a signal wasn’t warranted at this time. It could be in the future, however, when more development occurs in the area.\nSherman said the groundbreaking for the project should happen in the first quarter of 2016 and it will take around nine to 11 months to build the showroom, service bays and offices.\nThe dealership will employ around 50 people during first the few weeks and then ramp up hiring as business swells.\n“That could grow considerably,” he said, talking about the staffing level at the dealership. “It’s not only a great brand, it’s a growing brand.”\nContact the writer: aclaverie@pe.com , 951-368-9698, @PE_Claverie", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp0co-b88547577z.120151023144104000gu2conop.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp0cn-b88547577z.120151023144104000gjmcoh3e.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp0cn-b88547577z.120151023144104000gjmcoh3o.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp0cn-b88547577z.120151023144104000gjmcoh3e.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp0co-b88547577z.120151023144104000gu2conop.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp0cn-b88547577z.120151023144104000gjmcoh3o.10.jpg", "http://www.hoehnmotors.com/careers.htm"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:03:54.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
