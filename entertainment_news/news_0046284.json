Despite being one of the oldest wine areas in Italy it has long been a sleepy backwater, the sort of place you would see a pig ambling along the side of a dusty road, the sort of place that produced large quantities of bulk wine nobody wanted. In this respect it’s not unlike Piedmont and Tuscany before the money and the Mercedes arrived. [caption id=\"attachment_3663\" align=\"\" width=\"1512\"] Ilaria Petitto Photo: Nivk Passmore[/caption]Ilaria has a vision of changing all that, starting with her own wines. It involved a move from wine, or rather grapes, being just another agricultural product to be sold to a large producer, in this case Mastroberardino, to an emphasis on quality, to making the sorts of wines that people in Northern Europe and North America would actually want to drink. This is a radical departure for the wines of southern Italy which, in past centuries, were unlikely to make it much further than the restaurants of Naples. But it is a pattern that was started in Piedmont and Tuscany and has now spread south as Petitto is showing that it is possible to make quality wine in the rocky, sunbaked hills of Avellino, 50 km north of Naples.[caption id=\"attachment_3664\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] DonnaChiara[/caption]And much of it is being made not with international varietals like Merlot and Chardonnay, but indigenous grapes that are showing remarkable elegance when grown and vinified employing a level of care, attention and scientific knowledge that was unheard of 30 years ago. “Everything is different today” Petitto explained. “We built the cellar with modern technologies….because we want to produce a wine in the best way we can, we want to give to our enologist all the tools to work in the best way he can.” [caption id=\"attachment_3675\" align=\"\" width=\"1216\"] Cantine di Marzo[/caption]And she’s not alone, as the presence of her fellow winemakers in New York demonstrates. “In Avellino now there are so many wineries because everybody they decide to make their wine, they don’t want to sell the grapes anymore. It’s a trend.” A trend that is with real momentum – Campania is the coming region so expect to hear much more of their wines in the future.
