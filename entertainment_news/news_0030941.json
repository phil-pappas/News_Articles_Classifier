It was acquired last year by the university's Harry Ransom Center, one of the world's largest collectors of humanities original source material.\nThe prolific Colombian-born García Márquez, who died in April 2014 in Mexico City at age 87, started out as a newspaper reporter and was best known for \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" a dream-like, dynastic epic that helped him win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982.\n\"Readers have access to the finished works but through the archive, you see a human side of the master artist. This is the side in which he rejects paragraphs and entire pages and has to rewrite, or abandon a path for a new one,\" said Jose Montelongo, a bibliographer at the university who has worked with the material.\nThe collection includes nearly 40 boxes from his literary activities from 1948 to 2009, and has extensive typescript drafts of works such as \"Love in the Time of Cholera\", \"Of Love and Other Demons\" and \"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\"\nThere are also nearly a dozen boxes of correspondence dating from 1961 to 2013 which include letters to friends when García Márquez was struggling to get by in the 1960s while he was writing \"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\"\nAs the years went on and his fame grew, his circle of correspondence expanded to include Japanese film great Akira Kurosawa, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Czech writer Milan Kundera.\nAmong the other materials are photographs collected since the 1930s: travel pictures, shots of formal events and \"Amigos\" albums, which include photos of him with the likes of filmmakers Woody Allen and Luis Buñuel as well as Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\nThe library, with specializes in restoring and preserving historic material, will also be providing digital versions of many of the items in the García Márquez archive.\nThe collection will be housed with archives from other major authors who influenced García Márquez, including Jorge Luis Borges, William Faulkner and James Joyce.\n(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Mohammad Zargham )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:33:58.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
