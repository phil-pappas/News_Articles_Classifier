Them being born and me realising what true love was and them making me realise I need to love myself a little bit more really changed my life,” she said. \nJ-Lo said re-watching those scenes in her tour movie Dance Again, which documents her 2012 world tour including her having to deal with the break-up, wasn’t easy. \nShe recalled: “It was definitely documenting a very important time in my life – realising you’re at the bottom, the lowest you could go, going through a divorce with children and not knowing what you are going to do next with your life, and how you are going to survive and raise these two human beings on your own.

I hope people will enjoy it because at the end of the day, we’re all human and we all go through hard times, and eventually you will dance again.” Promoted stories \nThe 46-year-old star said she had doubts about embarking on the tour. \n“Touring is hard for any artist, it’s very demanding. But doing it with two kids in tow adds a whole other layer to it,” she said. \n“I definitely had some anxiety about it: what is this going to be like? How are the kids going to be? We’re going to be travelling so much, is it going to be too many planes for them? But at the end of the day, it was an amazing journey, not just physically but emotionally, and I think it will be an unforgettable experience for the kids. \n“They still say to me, ‘Mummy, when can we go back to Australia or Singapore?’ I realise it was a tremendous gift for all of us.” \nJennifer will kick off her Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood’s The Axis auditorium on January 20 2016 – the first of 20 initial dates. Jennifer Lopez (Andy Kropa/Invision) \nShe said: “I’m very excited about it. They offered it to me and I thought this is amazing because having done the world tour, it almost got me ready for this more intimate type of show. \n“It’s much smaller, it’s going to be something where I actually get to create the show I always visualised. You lose a lot on tour because you have to travel with too many things. I just look forward to what we can create there.” \nThe star added: “I want to create an unforgettable experience for anybody who comes. I want people to say, ‘You have to see the J-Lo show in Vegas’, that’s my dream for it.” Share article \nJennifer Lopez: Dance Again is out on DVD and Digital Download now.
