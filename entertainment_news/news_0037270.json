Mantle. $29.99. \nFor the 24th book in her alphabet series about Californian PI Kinsey Millhoneâ€‹, Grafton has broken with the tradition she started in 1982 with \"A\" is for Alibi and used a single-word title.\nX is set in 1989 and finds Millhone leery of the changing world in which she lives, and concerned that computers will replace good old-fashioned detective work. She also has two demanding cases on hand that involve her in art thefts, false identities and a stalking sociopath. Both cases draw the reader in, and the story holds attention all the way to the end. With two books to go, it will be interesting to see how Grafton wraps up her genre-defining series.\nTHE ASSASSINS\nBy Gayle Lynds.  Corvus. $24.99. \nAdvertisement This latest thriller from Gayle Lynds is a rollercoaster ride that starts with a violent robbery in war-torn Baghdad in 2003. From there, the book moves to present-day Washington DC and a series of killings that involve former intelligence operative Judd Ryder in a bloody battle between six renowned assassins for a share of Saddam Hussein's lost fortune.\nLynds is very good at this sort of international conspiracy thriller, and she keeps the bullets flying and the twists coming at such a brisk pace that it is easy to overlook the slips in logic and the occasionally clunky prose. A good fun read to put aside for the beach this summer.\nTENNISON\nBy Lynda La Plante. Simon & Schuster. $32.99. \nThe Prime Suspect television series, starring Helen Mirren in the landmark role of DCI Jane Tennison, is rightly regarded as one of the best crime fiction shows to air on television. Created by Lynda La Plante, it set a benchmark for quality which has rarely been surpassed.\nNow, after a long 20-year break, La Plante returns to her iconic heroine with a prequel set in 1970s London, with a young 22-year-old Tennison fresh out of training. Battling the inherent sexism of her colleagues and the dangers on the streets, Tennison is drawn into a brutal murder inquiry that will define her career. It is an enjoyable, albeit very lengthy, read.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:01:17.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
