However, the film hunk has confirmed in a new interview with BBC News that he has yet to make any decision if he is going to carry on playing the popular spy character or not. Asked if he had made a decision about carrying on as Bond, Craig answered, \"No - this is what's going on at the moment. I'm enjoying this.\" He then addressed the statement he previously made to the press that he would \" rather slash [his] wrists \" than make a fifth Bond film. \"I'm quite straightforward and I say things when I feel it and then I change my mind,\" he explained. \"I'm just like everybody else. People latch onto things. There's not a lot I can do about that.\" One thing for sure, when Craig is finally ready to pass the Bond baton, he only has one criteria for the person who fills Bond's shoes: He'd better be good. \"I don't care,\" he told BBC News about whoever plays Bond next. \"It's just as long as they're good. That's the only thing that matters.\" In fact, Craig told BBC that he did enjoy serving as a producer on \" Spectre \" as it only made the experience more worthwhile. \"I knew when I accepted the role that it would turn my life upside down and it did. There's no getting away from it,\" revealed the 47-year-old actor. \"I'm still enjoying it much more than I ever did because I've been allowed to bring what I know to the role. I've been involved with every aspect of film-making.\" \"Spectre\" is expected to hit theaters in London on Monday, October 26, while the U.S will have to wait until Friday, November 6. A preview screening for the flick was held in London on Wednesday, October 21. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Daniel Craig News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:46:48.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
