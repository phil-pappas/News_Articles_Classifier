Lehigh University latest to rescind Cosby's honorary degree 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) â€” Another Pennsylvania university has rescinded an honorary degree granted to Bill Cosby .\nLehigh University said Wednesday that conduct described by Cosby in a 2005 deposition is antithetical to its values.\nCourt documents unsealed in July show the 78-year-old Cosby admitting extramarital relationships with several women, some of whom accuse him of sexual assault.\nCosby has never been charged with a crime.\nLehigh awarded the honorary degree to the comedian in 2004. It says in a statement that his admitted behavior was \"inconsistent with the character and high standards\" expected of honorees.\nSeveral other schools, including Fordham, Marquette, Baylor and Pennsylvania's Wilkes University , have already pulled their Cosby degrees.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/33/8759039/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/33/8759039/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:43:48.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
