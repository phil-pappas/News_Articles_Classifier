In season one, after learning about the atrocities that were happening in Europe, and that she has family there, who are being persecuted because they're Jewish,\" Brosnahan continues. \nFor the actress herself, it helped that she considers herself a spiritual person. \n\"Spiritual means so many things. I happen to believe that 'religious' comes with a lot of baggage -- that word itself. But spiritual, absolutely,\" she says when asked. \"I think anybody who believes in something strongly could be considered spiritual.\" \nBack on screen, Brosnahan says viewers can expect her character to have a distinct shift in how she moves around Los Alamos. \n\"She arrived with absolutely no knowledge of what they were doing there at all, and what her life would be like and how it would change from what she was used to growing up in Brookline, Massachusetts. In season one, you see a very reactive Abby. Everything's being thrown at her. She's very overwhelmed. She's living moment to moment and not very successfully,\" she explains. \"And in season two, she becomes a lot more active in this crazy and scary game that they're playing.\" \nManhattan airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. Eastern on WGN. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
