Fascinating, funny, but a little under-cooked.\nPan (PG)\nAn origin story for the eternal youth, in which Peter is whisked to Neverland and introduced to his fairy powers and arch enemy – not Hook, but Bluebeard, played with pantomime panache by Hugh Jackman, the only reason to see a dissatisfying fantasy.\nShare article Hotel Transylvania 2 (U)\nReturn to Count Dracula’s getaway for monsters, which has now opened to human guests.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-18T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:52:18.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
