Dumaplin\nOctober 1, 2015 James Wolk\nUnlike humans that are able to cultivate and store food for future use, wild animals need to perpetually hunt for prey. Now, what would you do if you’ve become their target?\nYou could start educating yourself by watching “Zoo” starring James Wolk. The American series is adaptation of the international best-selling novel by James Patterson.\n“It basically explores what happens when animals kind of say, ‘We’ve had enough of humans’ and they turn on us,” Wolk told Bulletin Entertainment .\nIn the series, Wolk plays zoologist Jackson Oz who spends his days running safaris in the African wild along with his best friend, Abraham (played by Nonso Anozie), an expert on wildlife behavior.\n“When I read the script, although he doesn’t completely consider himself a hero, he’s very heroic and kind of an action hero in a way,” Wolk said of his character. “I’ve done comedy, I’ve done drama, more serious, dramatic roles but as far as playing an action hero (goes), I’ve never done that so it was a real joy to step into the role ’cause as an actor, variety makes it so exciting. That’s what’s so exciting about this career path of mine.”\nA memorable experience for him doing the show is the scene where he is caught in the middle of a lion attack.\n“The lions acted in a very bizarre way that’s uncharacteristic of what we knew about them… that part of the show will draw this picture that animals, in fact, are turning into humans in how they hunt for food… they’re getting sophisticated,” he said.\nShooting the series was harsh, often involving “15-16 hours a day” of work for about six months. But it wasn’t without laughs.\nHe recalled, “One time we were shooting a bear and it kind of fell asleep in the middle of a shooting, which no one was expecting so, we just had to wait for it a bit.”\nThough “Zoo” is foremost entertainment, it also wants to impart a message. “That we should start treating animals a bit better,” said Wolk.\nHe is confident people will appreciate the series as it is very “interesting,” something that has not been done “very recently.”\n“This idea that the entire animal kingdom is turning into humans is quite fresh,” he said.\n“I think it’s going to be interesting for many that it explores what happens when animals and humans collide in a very tumultuous way,” he added.\nIn the pilot episode titled “First Blood,” Jackson starts discovering links between strange animal attacks on people occurring around the world. He would recall his late father’s controversial theories about an impending threat to the human race.\nJournalist Jamie Campbell (played by Kristen Connolly) and veterinary pathologist Mitch Morgan (played by Billy Burke), on the other hand, will team up to investigate similar abnormal animal behavior in Los Angeles.\nFrench investigator Chloe Tousignant (played by Nora Arnezeder) will then attempt to uncover the reason behind the animals’ violent behavior.\n“Zoo” starts airing today at 10 p.m. on Lifetime.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:49:22.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
