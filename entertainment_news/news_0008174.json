A number of those associates were chosen to appear in the national television commercials and in content across various channels and platforms.  They include:\nDesiree, resident programs director, Jacksonville, Fla. Elizabeth, Clare Bridge program coordinator, St. Petersburg, Fla. Kevin, dining services director, Chicago, Il. Cam, maintenance technician, San Marcos, Cal. \"All of us at some point will have to choose where and how to live our later years.
