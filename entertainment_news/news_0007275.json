Stine, whose 'Goosebumps' book series comes to life.\nJack Black, star of 'Goosebumps,' poses for a portrait at the London West Hollywood Hotel. (Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY)\nCONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE LOS ANGELES — Jack Black may not appear to be the coolest customer around, but during a celebrity-filled flight-from-hell out of Cancun this summer, he might as well have been James Bond.\nBlack wasn't stirred when a tropical storm buffeted the plane upon which he was flying with his wife, Tanya Haden —along with Naomi Watts, Liev Schreiber and Seth Rogen, who were also leaving the island after a promotional event.\n\"It was like a (Category 1) hurricane blowing through,\" says Black. \"We white-knuckled it. We took off and it was intense turbulence. No one screamed. But you could hear some screams on the inside.\"\nBlack insists that he gallantly held his wife's hand until the rocking stopped, adding, \"There's something romantic about those dangerous situations.\"\nUSA TODAY\nJack Black goes dark in 'Goosebumps'\nRight. So what scares the actor, who has taken on the role of youth-friendly horror author R.L. Stine in Goosebumps (in theaters Friday)? \"He actually doesn't scare easily,\" acknowledges Rob Letterman, his director and longtime collaborator.\nWe ran through the scariest things imaginable.\nThat 'Alien': Black regrets choosing Ridley Scott's 1979 classic Alien as his first horror movie at age 10. \"It's the most terrifying movie ever made. I was not ready for it at 10. I couldn't sleep for a month,\" he says. \"My eyes just remained open. I wanted to unsee that.\"\nJack Black stars in 'Goosebumps,' in which he plays children's horror author R.L. Stine. In 'Goosebumps' Black considers his nemesis, Slappy the Dummy, the scariest creature in Goosebumps. It doesn't hurt that Slappy features Black's voice. USA TODAY\nZombies: Black and his wife were fans of AMC's zombie-tastic The Walking Dead in its first season. But the show slid downhill, in his opinion. \"It's gotten pretty schlocky,\" he says.\nBut the couple still watches religiously. \"We cannot help it, the momentum has carried us. We have to know what has happened to our favorite soap opera. It's Days of Our Lives with zombies,\" says Black.\nBlack just isn't afraid of shambling monsters. \"You put them all in the same category: zombies, Frankenstein, mummies — slow-moving ghouls. Only dangerous if you fall asleep on them.\"\nJack Black stars in 'Goosebumps.' (Photo: Hopper Stone, Sony)\nDracula: It's a different story with the swift-moving fanged undead, especially Gary Oldman's performance in 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula. That got Black's pulse going. \"One vampire could destroy an army of Frankensteins,\" he says.\nThe ever-expanding universe: Black insists his biggest fear is literally the cosmos and his puny role in it.\n\"Sometimes I'll just think about the size and scope of the universe and the bottom of my belly gives way in a way that's kind of goosebumps or spine tingles,\" says Black. We cut him off before he could go too far with this.\nJack Black overcomes his 'Goosebumps' to get close to Slappy the Dummy. (Photo: Amanda Edwards, WireImage)\n'Goosebumps' monsters: Black considers his nemesis, Slappy the Dummy, the scariest creature in Goosebumps. It doesn't hurt that Slappy features Black's voice. \"But it's that disturbing leer. He's diabolical,\" says Black.\nSeeing werewolves, zombies and the Abominable Snowman run down a school hallway in the movie's dramatic monster scene was also exciting. But being behind the scenes took the goosebumps out for Black. The actors playing Snake Lady and Bog Monster were a real-life couple, for example.\n\"You come out of the trailer, and there's a 7-foot-tall mummy,\" says Black. \"You're taken aback by the creepiness. And then the mummy is like, 'Hey, man, I'm such a big fan.' \"\nJACK BLACK HAS A LOT ON HIS MIND Jack Black talks about the size of the universe | 02:00 Jack Black, star of the 'Goosebumps' movie, talks about his thoughts on the size of the universe.
