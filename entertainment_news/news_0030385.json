News. \nSo, like, 1D totally announced it's gonna drop a new record on Nov. 13 which is TOTALLY the same day Justin Bieber (little hearts) is releasing HIS record, OMG, lots of smiley faces, etc. \nSorry ...that's about all the 13-year-old girl I've got. \nAnyway, the Beebs took to snapchat on Wednesday, saying, \"The face you make when you come out with an album on the same day as Justin Bieber,\" he says, making an expression that's supposed to indicate false fear.

I don't know -- the Brits are strange. \nTomlinson was referring to the band's recent sold-out, six-night run at London's big O2 Arena. \nWe'll get back to you regarding this silliness when there's something equally important to report.
