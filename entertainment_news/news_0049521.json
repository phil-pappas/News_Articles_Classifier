Timothy Spall (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nHis head bent forward, and with broad shoulders under a tightly fixed gaze, he conjures the unmistakable posture of the former firebrand preacher turned power-sharing peacemaker. \nMeaney as deputy First Minister McGuinness pulls off the ex-IRA commander’s furrowed brow and unflinching demeanour, not to mention their matching curly hair. \nWritten by novelist and screenwriter Colin Bateman, the film centres on a fictional journey by one-time sworn enemies Paisley and McGuinness during a pivotal era in the peace process. \nMcGuinness once commanded the IRA in his native Derry and faced implacable opposition from the man at times dubbed Dr No and whose best known phrase was “never, never, never”. Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness (Julien Behal/PA) \nBut Paisley eventually said yes – to sharing power with Sinn Fein in 2007 – and ushered in what some characterised as a groundbreaking moment in British and Irish history. \nThe DUP leader became first minister with Mr McGuinness as his deputy. \nTheir burgeoning friendship was evident at the many public functions which they attended together, leading to them being dubbed the “Chuckle Brothers”. \nFilming is taking place in and around Belfast. Toby Stephens (Jonathan Brady/PA) \nToby Stephens plays prime minister Tony Blair while Freddie Highmore is cast as Jack, a young government employee tasked with driving Paisley and McGuinness on their journey.
