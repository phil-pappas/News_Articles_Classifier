KFOG mornings: No names, no big egos 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Renee Richardson , who’s been at KFOG since 1999 and has weathered numerous storms in recent years, recalls Jim Richards , the program director, asking a simple question when he arrived in May of last year.\n“Can we make this station sound fun?”\nFor years, KFOG had been anything but. After nice runs in the ’80s and ’90s with its eclectic mix of rock, aimed mainly at Boomers, and after longtime morning anchor Dave Morey retired in 2008, KFOG began losing its way. It went through numerous changes in managers, DJs and musical emphasis. It also lost listeners, including loyal ones known as “Fogheads.” When Morey left, KFOG was among the top 10 stations for overall listeners. The most recent ratings show it outside the top 20.\nNot fun. Now, the station is trying hard to right itself. Two DJs who left — Annalisa (for another gig) and Webster (fired) are back. So is “ Irish ” Greg McQuaid , who was dismissed with Webster in 2008 and found work at KOSF (Big 103.7) with Don Bleu .\nMcQuaid and Richardson were half of the Morey-anchored morning show, along with newscaster Peter Finch . Now, they’re teamed with “ No Name ” ( Mike Nelson ), who made, and almost ruined, his nonexistent name at KITS (Live 105) and KLLC (Alice). All three logged time on Live 105, in roles ranging from interns to DJs, and their camaraderie is evident.\nThey are not a morning zoo; they are not nasty gossips; they don’t argue or diss rival stations and DJs. “We’re not a conflict show,” says McQuaid. Nelson adds, “It’s three people having fun. It’s like a ‘ Breakfast Club .’”\nWell, a modern-day brekkie bash. Interviewing a guest about an upcoming outdoor music festival, Richardson asks whether there’ll be seat cushions available, and Nelson pipes in, “That’d be a good KFOG promotion. Put Renee’s face on it, and it’s like, ‘Sit on my face.’”\nRichardson, as she is wont to do, cracks up. Nelson, she says, is the “wild card” of the show. For years, as “No Name” readily admits, he was simply wild. “It was a blur. Radio allows you, at a younger age, to not worry, to party all the time. It was all one Green Day concert. I was too much of a Cro-Magnon.” His less-than-stellar reputation, he says, “was warranted. I probably spent a decade in this market completely out of my mind. But that’s OK. People can change. I’ve got kids now, and I deal with greater life things.”\nNelson, 42, was fine by the end of his last stint on Live 105, and when he was let go last fall. By then, Richardson, who’d handled various shifts and served as music director, was doing mornings by herself, and sometimes sounded lonely. “It was pretty stripped down,” she says. “I held down the fort.” But new program director Richards told her, “We’re going to build a morning show; hang tight.” When McQuaid left KOSF, Richardson suggested hiring him back. Done. And when they heard that Nelson was jobless, says McQuaid, “Renee and I were saying, ‘Wouldn’t that be great.’”\nRichardson, McQuaid says, is the “keeper of the flame in many ways.” But, she adds quickly, “Without keeping the past too in the forefront. We want to move forward.” She notes, “We’re playing more new music than we have in a long time.”\nMcQuaid is the production anchor, the director of the show. Many features — contests, interviews and chat segments — are actually recorded moments (and, sometimes, days) before they air. It’s McQuaid who quickly edits the pieces, then directs Richardson and Nelson on how to lead into them. As one recorded bit plays, Nelson laughs. “We listen to ourselves every day.”\n“When we record the bit,” says McQuaid, “it forces you to be more conscious of what you’re saying. It sounds better.” Especially when McQuaid edits out pauses, mistakes and boring comments. But, nimble as he is, he makes mistakes. Recently, he says, he let an F-bomb through. And when Michael Franti visited and made up a melody for a song for KFOG’s “Boob Project,” McQuaid accidentally deleted his vocals, leaving only a guitar track.\nThe “Boob Project”? That’s a yearlong venture aimed at raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation . It began with Nelson’s 8-year-old son writing the basis of a song about his mother’s battle with breast cancer. “There was a lot of talk around the house,” says Nelson, and one day, he learned that one of his sons had come up with a song, “Boob Spelled Backwards Is Boob.” Despite its title, the song is evocative, even poetic — “I am dreaming that I am a leaf on a tree, I’m swaying all around in the breeze,” one line goes. When Nelson mentioned his son’s efforts on the air, McQuaid suggested inviting visiting artists to contribute to the song. Besides Franti, they include Spandau Ballet , Florence + the Machine , Noel Gallagher , Matt Nathanson , Graham Nash , and members of the Grateful Dead .\nThe resulting song, along with a homemade video, was released Oct. 1, the beginning of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. “The idea,” says Nelson, “is to punch people in the gut with the song. And the video will be moving, and we’ll get a lot of people to donate a lot of money.” (For more info on the song and the project, go to www.KFOG.com/boobproject. \nNelson’s wife is Christi . He wouldn’t divulge his songwriting son’s name. Guess we’ll have to settle for No Name Jr . \nGiant departure: After five years on her second time around the bases on KISQ (Kiss 98.1), Renel Brooks-Moon has left the morning show, which she’d been co-hosting with Christie James . Brooks-Moon, who first joined Kiss in 1997 and left in 2009, juggled radio with her work as PA announcer at Giants home games and other media work. Her feature, “Renel’s Record Party ,” remains, airing weekdays at noon. James’ new partner is Chino Iglesias , who moved over from sister station KYLD (Wild 94.9), where he’d been the afternoon driver for seven years. \nWinner: KGO’s Ronn Owens is being inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. He won in the “Longstanding Local/Regional 20+ Years” category (Smooth writing, Hall of Fame!) and will be enshrined at ceremonies at the Museum of Broadcast & Communications in Chicago in November.\nBen Fong-Torres is a freelance writer.
