I was hoping for something that honored the past, celebrated the present and forecast the future. I know that's asking a lot.\nA couple dozen people emailed me; a small but pleasing group made use of the United States Postal Service. Over 100 people weighed in on Facebook.\nSome of their comments focused on Rochester's problems. There are real problems, for sure, but mottoes tend to shine a light on the positive, so I'll stick with the upbeat.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, several nominees focused — tongue in cheek, I'm sure — on our city's signature dish.\nRochester: Where We Eat our Garbage on a Plate (Rob Keim), and Rochester: A Cultural Garbage Plate (Michelle Spring), would play well here but might confuse outsiders.\nPoll: Which slogan is your favorite?\nAnd Suzanne Lanyak had offered a hot dog allusion that would ring a Zweigle's bell locally: Rochester: It's hot…white hot!\nSurprise, our area's sometimes challenging weather made for these mottoes:\nRochester: Where you can get frostbite and sunburn in the same week (Maureen Ó Brien Placilla; Rochester: Where every day is different (Joyce Maddalena); Rochester: We weather it better (Rebecca Porter); and Rochester: A city for all seasons, even in one day (Nance Camilleri).\nI've noted before that Rochesterians don't like to brag, and this tendency was reflected in these modest mottoes that I liked, even though civic slogans aren't supposed to be self-effacing:\nRochester: No, not the one in Minnesota (Anna Kenny); Rochester: It's an acquired taste (Charles Dinsmore); and Rochester: At least it's cheap (Suzanne Lanyak).\nAnd I'm not sure if it's modesty or low-bar setting, but a few of the suggestions raised Rochester up by taking other cities down, as in Rochester: At Least it ain't Syracuse (Jay Ferris) or Rochester: At Least it's not Cleveland (John Hamlett).\nRochester is a literary town, what with all the colleges, so it was to be expected that at least one entry was in the form of a haiku: Rochester: Surprising Rest'raunts/World-class art and museums/all within your reach (Steve Terry).\nAnd now, let's try to pick a winner. The poll here includes one — Rochester: Limitless — that is going to be the motto created by Jay Advertising for a new campaign by Visit Rochester.\nIn each case the motto is followed by its creator/supporter in parentheses.\nWe'll announce the winner or winners in a couple weeks.\n1. Rochester Rocks or Rochester Rocs (nominated by several people.)\n2. Rochester: Gem on the Genesee (Michele Spring, Pete Schickler)\n3. Rochester: Historically Progressive (Alinda Drury, Kate Morse)\n4. Rochester: Limitless (Visit Rochester)\n5. Rochester: Light the way to the future (Judy Pfau Hull)\n6. Rochester: City of Vision (Keith Perez).\nDEMOCRATANDCHRONICLE.COM\nRemarkable Rochesterians\nOn Remarkable Rochester\nRetired Senior Editor Jim Memmott reflects on what makes Rochester distinctively Rochester, its history, its habits, its people.

A native of Connecticut, he gave up his law practice in Canandaigua rather than defend a man whom he believed was guilty of murder. He also was a bookseller and served as the Ontario County clerk and a member of the state Assembly. He later was a leader in the anti-slavery movement and a founder of the Liberty Party. The village of Holley carries his name.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e2c0ae47130281fce68bc7cfa2d874d22965767/c=32-0-474-589&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/29/Rochester/Rochester/635791280999162462-Myron-Holley.jpg", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9101629.js", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e94fcffe3ce0ffecfee87bb20ebdfe07b7628d10/r=300/http/nydatabases.com/sites/all/themes/ny_databases/img/nydatabases_promo.jpg", "http://poll.fm/5f2v1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c2e58d197411c936aefd96cbe9f4e2c156840214/r=304x400/local/-/media/2015/09/29/Rochester/Rochester/635791280999162462-Myron-Holley.jpg", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/9101629/", "http://rochester.nydatabases.com/database/remarkable-rochesterians", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/29/Rochester/Rochester/635791280999162462-Myron-Holley.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:07:35.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
