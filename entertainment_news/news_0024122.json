It's such an honour to be recognised by Guinness World Records.\n\"It's been an unbelievable eighteen months - the album exceeded even my wildest dreams thanks to the incredible support of my fans, and to record the first ever Bond theme to reach No 1 in the UK is a real privilege.\"\nGuinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday said: \"Sam Smith has had an incredible impact on the music industry since his debut album first hit the charts last year and the longevity of its stay is truly astonishing.\nShare article \"His second Guinness World Records title is equally as impressive as many talented artists for over half a century have tried and failed to write a James Bond theme and get it to the top of the charts, so what Sam has achieved will always be remembered in the record books.\"\nThe Guinness World Records 2016 edition is out now.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-19T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:50:23.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
