This Halloween, we'll find out if the nail finally hits the coffin with the so-called \"final\" installment of the still-successful found-footage film series \"Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension.\" Here's a new final trailer for the first and last 3D installment of the Paranormal sequels, which once again follows a family haunted by an evil spirit. The final tale follows another unsuspecting family who moves into their new home and find a vintage camcorder hidden in the garage. Along with the camera are old tapes that contain footage of the past tenants who were haunted by an entity that seemed to have abducted their two young daughters. Rather than leaving immediately after viewing the tapes, the family naturally gets haunted and their young daughter is now being possessed by the demon that's claims the house as its own. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension stars Chris J. Murray, Brit Shaw, Ivy George, Dan Gill, Chloe Csengery, Jessica Tyler Brown, Olivia Taylor Dudley Release: October 23rd, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:35:40.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
