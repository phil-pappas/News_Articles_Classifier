Since it began in the late 1980s, YBI has grown steadily. This year, it purchased the former Vindicator building with the goal of making it the fifth building in its downtown campus. \nThe former Vindicator building, on the corner of Vindicator Square and Boardman Street, was constructed in 1931. Many people who have toured the building since the YBI takeover commented that it would be an ideal location for a murder-mystery event, said Colleen Kelly, director of development for YBI. The idea grew, and Kelly contacted Robert Dennick Joki of Rust Belt Theater Company to put the wheels in motion. \nJoki was excited for the opportunity and began writing a script that would both work in the space and utilize the actors who were available. \n“We love doing theater in unexpected places. It challenges our actors and gives the audience a one-of-a-kind experience. In creating this show for YBI, our aim is to give the attendees an evening they will never forget,” said Joki. \nThe play, titled “Head Games,” has a cast of six. Joki describes the plot: “Eccentric millionaire Archibald Van Houten has died. An eclectic group of his relatives and acquaintances gather for the reading of his last will and testament, and as the bodies begin to pile up, it becomes apparent that his death may have been the result of foul play.” \nThe audience determines the ending. \nJoki wrote the play in steampunk genre. \n“I decided to go with a steampunk theme because I love the idea of mixing time periods, and the age and condition of the pre-renovated building really lends to that,” said Joki. \nSo far, said Kelly, almost no work has been done on the building. Some poles and outlets have been removed, but the location is largely untouched, which makes it perfect for the event. \n“We are so excited about this event and partnering with the Rust Belt Theater Company, as this promises to be a very unique fundraiser. This event not only allows our guests to come and be part of a fantastic show, but it will also give them the opportunity to tour a very old building with a lot of character before the renovations begin,” said Kelly. \nGuests can choose to attend the event from 5 to 7 p.m. or from 8 to 10 p.m. The play will be performed twice, at 5:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., in the creepy basement of the building. \nBefore and after the performances, audience members can dine in the second-floor party room, which will also include a photo booth, virtual reality demonstrations, 3-D printing and facility tours. The food stations, which include beer, wine and soft drinks, are being donated by Covelli Enterprises, the main sponsor for the event. \nOn the first floor will be the “RIP Lounge,” with furniture donated by Aaron’s Inc. Guests can attend the 5:30 p.m. performance and relax in the lounge afterward to watch the Ohio State University football game, said Kelly. \nGuests are encouraged to come dressed in steampunk costume or casual attire. \nTickets for the evening are $50 and include the play performance, food, drinks and activities. Tickets can be purchased at eventbrite.com or by phone at 330-599-4505.
