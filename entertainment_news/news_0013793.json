The widow of a Nassau County plainclothes cop who was fatally shot in a tragic case of friendly fire has reached a confidential settlement with the MTA officer who mistook the victim for an armed perpetrator and the retired NYPD officer whose cry of \"gun\" triggered the incident.\nOfficer Geoffrey Breitkopf was a member of the elite Bureau of Special Operations on March 12, 2011 when he responded to a house in Massapequa, L.I., where fellow Nassau County cops had shot dead a knife-wielding psycho.\nBreitkopf apparently did not have his badge displayed and was carrying a rifle slung over his shoulder. John Cafarella, a resident of the area who was a retired sergeant in the NYPD's elite Emergency Service Unit, shouted \"He's got a gun!\" referring to Breitkopf.\nMTA cop Glenn Gentile, who had also responded to the scene, fired one shot at Breitkopf from about five feet away, killing him.\nGentile claimed he had no \"conscious memory\" of having fired his gun, according to papers filed in Long Island Federal Court.\nThe widow, Paula Breitkopf, had also sued New York City because MTA cops received firearms and tactics training from the NYPD. But Federal Judge Joseph Bianco tossed out the suit against the city as well as the parents of the Satan-loving madman, Anthony DiGeronimo, who was fatally shot by Nassau County cops.\nThe settlement will be paid by the MTA on behalf of Gentile, Cafarella, and the estate of Anthony DiGeronimo, which is covered by his parents' homeowners insurance policy, said Breitkopf's lawyer John Zervopoulos.\nRelated Stories EXCLUSIVE: Rikers guards beat jail visitor, lawsuit says EXCLUSIVE: FDNY widow seeks mercy for family mob member EXCLUSIVE: $500G settlement for family of man killed by cop", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:10:39.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
