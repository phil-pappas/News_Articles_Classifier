The actress, who often tops polls as one of the most bea-utiful women in the world, is in her fifties and insists that she's not scared of getting older. At 51, Monica predicts that the much dreaded menopause is around the corner but while some may feel afflicted, she's ready to embrace it. \"But menopause is a natural thing, it is not a sickness,\" she said in an interview recently.\n\"OK, the body at the begi-nning will get a bit mad. But after a few months, or one year, it's going to be OK. This is a natural process of life. I am not nervous about it at all.\" The actress is hoping to use natural hormones to help deal with the menopause, but concedes that it will be a dramatic switch of pace in life considering that she was nursing her child less than five years ago.\n\"Listen, I had two kids - one when I was 40, one when I was 45. I breast-fed for one year, which means I was breast-feeding four years ago. I'm going to move from giving birth to menopause without really realising,\" she said, before adding: \"Anyway the menopause is going to be great: no periods any more.\" While the actress, who claims to have a sporadic attitude to working out, has a positive approach to the menopause, she's not quite ready to rock her grey hairs.\nShe said: \"Unless it was for work. For work, yes; for life, no. Maybe later. I have some friends who have white hair and they look amazing.\" Monica plays Lucia Sciarra, the widow of an assassin killed by Bond, in Spectre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:42:19.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
