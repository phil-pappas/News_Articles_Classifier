Photo: Channel Seven \nEnglish hypnotist Peter Powers makes a bunch of Australians do very silly things in very public places in Channel Seven's new series Mesmerised . He's not worried that they might feel humiliated.\n\"They know it's a comedy,\" he says. \"People who volunteer know what it will entail, but not specifically the routine, because the way hypnosis works, if the person knows in advance what is required of them, you will not get the subconsciously driven hypnotic response.\n\"I've been doing the stage shows for 31 years, and I've had no complaints from people saying, 'I didn't know you were going to make me squawk like a chicken or behave like a belly dancer'. I say to them in advance that their imagination can be played with, so I can make something appear that isn't really there, or I can make something disappear that is really there, I can change your mood, I can make you ecstatic, I can make you think somebody has a really bad smell if they sit next to you.\nPeter Powers on Bondi Beach in Mesmerised . Photo: Channel Seven \n\"But the assurance I could give them for this series, because this is Channel Seven, prime time, is you will not behave in any way that is sexual in nature, you will not be removing your clothes, you won't be swearing, this is a family show where people can watch with their children. There's no way we're going to expose people to something they find humiliating or that they'll never live down with their families.\nAdvertisement \"They don't forget, by the way. When you've finished filming, it's not as if they think, 'I've just come round, I've got no idea what just happened'. That's a misconception. The people who've been involved in a certain routine, they know about it.\"\nPowers, who was 12 when he first hypnotised his young brother, maintains that anybody can be hypnotised, given enough time and their co-operation and concentration, but different people need different techniques. Are Australians more or less suggestible than other nationalities?\nKirsten Dunst says her transition to television in Fargo has not been easy. Photo: SBS \n\"People's hypnotisability is very similar in different countries, but there is something about the Australians in that they love to volunteer. If I had 500 people in an audience in England, I might get 10 or 15 to volunteer. I might get 20 in Scotland. But in Australia that would be 50. People are adventurous, a sense of being up for it.\n\"And Australians have a great sense of humour. When I'm hypnotising people, what I'm really doing is having fun myself; I write routines that I find funny. That taste differs around the world. In Australia, if you've got blokes sitting in a bar, they ride each other, find a little weak point, have a dig. Even if it's me being a pommy bastard, I enjoy that.\"\nMesmerised airs on Thursday, October 22, at 8pm on Channel Seven. \nFargo revisited Since she was kissed at the age of 12 by Brad Pitt, in Interview With the Vampire , Kirsten Dunst has made 44 movies. Now, at 33, she's making the transition to television, starring in season two of Fargo . She described her character, a seemingly wholesome hairdresser named Peggy, to London's The Telegraph : \"She does a lot of weird things. She's got her own intentions, and she won't let anyone stop her, and it starts to get a little ugly.\"\nShe told The Observer she shifted from movies because \"there are just too many movies being made, I think. So many of them get lost. People don't go to the cinema unless it's an event any more … The creative people are blossoming on television.\"\nBut she's finding the transition difficult. \"Doing a television show is much, much harder work than film, because you're doing 10 pages a day. You don't get that many takes, and my character does not stop talking.\"\nAt least she doesn't have the trouble of Patrick Wilson, whose cop character, Lou Solverson, was played in season one by Keith Carradine. Wilson has to show what Solverson was like 30 years before Carradine's interpretation.\n\"What I love about Keith Carradine is the weight he carries in his eyes. He's one of the most soulful actors,\" Wilson told Entertainment Weekly .\nWilson didn't try to replicate Carradine's accent, but he did \"nerdy actor stuff\" to copy his mannerisms: \"Something like the way a man sits, yeah, he may sit the same way for a long time. And the way he crosses his legs and the way he holds a gun – that I was very specific with.\"\nThe first two episodes of Fargo air on Wednesday, October 21, at 8.30pm on SBS1. \nFor more, visit The Tribal Mind .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:01:47.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
