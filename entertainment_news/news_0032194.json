As someone who has been a dogged critic of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and policies such as Australia's offshore detention regime, he was asked by host Fifi Box whether he had any thoughts on Australia's new leader.\nRussell Brand brought his eccentric political commentary to The Project on Friday. Photo: Screenshot, The Project, Channel Ten \n\"Yes, here is that opinion now,\" said Brand, sitting up straight.\nAdvertisement \"Why do you put really, really rich people in charge of your country for, who want to build a thing called a tax shield?\" he said, referring to the Coalition giving private companies that earn more than $100 million a year an exemption from new tax disclosure requirements. \nHe then went on to criticise Turnbull and revelations - hammered by the Labor party this week - that the prime minister has some of his wealth located in the Cayman Islands. But he did it in a very Russell Brand sort of way, with one of the stranger metaphors ever used in Australian public life.\nBrand with the hosts and fellow guest Lara Worthington on The Project. Photo: The Project, Twitter \n\"[Turnbull] goes he's got money in the Cayman Islands but there's nothing wrong with it... Having your money in the Cayman Islands is like putting your dick into custard,\" said Brand.\n\"We all want to do it, but there's no rational reason to do it.\"\n\"If your dick's in a bowl of custard you're doing it for a reason.\"\nHosts Carrie Bickmore and Fifi Box respond to Brand's bizarre take on Turnbull and tax havens. Photo: Screenshot, The Project, Channel Ten \nWhether they understood the metaphor or not most of the panel and audience fell about laughing - though the look on host Waleed Aly's face was perhaps more bemused, or pained.\n\"Just reminding you we are live,\" chimed in Peter Hellier.\nA smiling Aly then drew a line under the bawdy segment, dead-panning: \"On the upside though Bill Shorten has his next line, which is going to be wonderful.\"\nA somewhat perplexed Waleed Aly and Carrie Bickmore after Brand's rant on The Project.
