The contrast between the rich older patrons and the struggling young people who serve them makes a great metaphor for the brink of adulthood. The young people get a glimpse of the lives they can live – or can avoid living – depending on the choices they make this summer.\nAmazon Studios makes a contribution to this well-populated genre with “Red Oaks,” a 10-episode comedy set at a Long Island country club in the 1980s.\nCraig Roberts plays David, an NYU student who comes to the Red Oaks Country Club to teach tennis to its rich members. David is studying accounting but longs to be a filmmaker; he’s dating a local nursing student, Karen (Gage Golightly), who dreams of a suburban life for the two of them.\nOver the summer, David develops uneasy relationships with the club president (Paul Reiser) and his artsy daughter (Alexandra Socha) that get him rethinking his path.\nThe theme is repeated by other characters in the excellent ensemble, including David’s mother, played by Jennifer Grey. (A brilliant bit of casting, given that her most celebrated role was as the coming-of-ager herself in “Dirty Dancing.”)\nThe central story works quite well; Roberts is excellent, and Reiser gives his character some real depth. Where “Red Oaks” frays is around the edges, as it presses to add more laughs to remind us that we’re watching a comedy.\nToo many side characters are caricatures, too many attempts at humor miss the mark. It’s best when it focuses on David and his personal crisis.\nTo the show’s credit, it does not run the 1980s in our faces as so many comedies set in the period insist on doing. The big hair, the workout gear, the hair-band music, the Nagel posters are there, but they frame the story naturally.\nIn all, “Red Oaks” is a decent addition to the coming-of-age catalog.\nNEW AND NOTABLE \nStreaming: “Finding Jesus: Faith.
