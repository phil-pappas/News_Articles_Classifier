Dance instructor and “Dance Moms” reality television star Abby Lee Miller — who was indicted on charges of bankruptcy fraud — is also known for her curt words to students.\nScott Gries Abby Lee Miller is a dance instructor, choreographer, owner of Reign Dance Productions, and one of the stars of the reality television show, \"Dance Moms.\" Scott Gries/Don Gries Miller's approach to teaching her dance students may seem more cold than hot. Lifetime Miller has gotten into on-air fights on \"Dance Moms\" with some of the students' parents. One of Miller's students, Mackenzie Ziegler, began training with Abby Lee Miller before the age of 10. Previous Next Enlarge The 50-year-old Miller — who faces up to five years in prison and heavy fines for lying about more than $750,000 of income — is familiar to some for her tough love teaching strategy.\nHere are some of the craziest things Abby Lee Miller has ever said, or yelled, on the Lifetime TV show to her dance students:\n“Maddie, you didn’t win. Your sister beat you, so you failed...get off your butt, walk over to Ross, and buy a ball!”\nMiller finds herself spreading words of encouragement and love by telling one of her star dance students, Maddie Ziegler, that she failed because her sister, Mackenzie, beat her during a competition.\nZiegler has gone on to become a familiar face in pop culture.\nThe dynamic 13-year-old has starred in number of popular music videos for Grammy-award winning singer-songwriter Sia, has been featured in Elle, iD, and NyLon magazines, and purchased a one million dollar home in May.\n“That embarrasses me. It’s unprofessional. It makes me look bad. Your hair? You control. That’s your responsibility. The way you all look when you step onstage, that’s the easy part!”\nPicture being a young girl, barely a teenager, who regularly performs onstage with dozens of onlookers.\nWith that, add being scolded about your hair by an adult who is not your parent.\n“No more recess! Were you outside at recess? Outside, running around, playing all day. She is useless.”\nNot only does Miller tell a child, named Mackenzie, that she is useless, but the young girl is also shamed for playing outside during recess, which is a word defined as a time period created for kids to play.\n“Fix this hair. ‘Cause it’s horrible. Horrible.”\nMiller did not directly tell one of her students, Nia, that her hair was horrible.\nRather, the harsh words were said to Nia’s mother, with Nia withering close behind.\nAs the only African-American child in the class being told that her hair is horrible by a teacher, Miller appears especially cruel.\n“Ava! You’re too tall for us today. You’re cut. Thank you. You can go.”\nAbby Lee Miller crushes another young dancer’s heart by telling her that she is not a part of the performance team because she is too tall.\nWhen the dismissed performer, Ava, thanks Miller for the opportunity of even gracing her famous dance studio, the dance instructor replies by saying “You’re a great dancer. You’re gonna be successful. You can get away from your mother and get great training.”\nAva’s mother was standing right next to her.\ncsmith@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Bomb squad investigates packages sent to ‘Dance Moms' star ‘Dance Mom’ who attacked TV coach will have charges dropped Sia releases music video for ‘Big Girls Cry’ Video of 'Dance Moms' fight doesn't tell true story: lawyers Tags: lists , news break , abby lee miller", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/109VJ3sf2aw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKCHifEmSMs", "http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/reality-tv-performer-charged-defrauding-bankruptcy-court-hiding-assets-and-lying-about", "http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/42403/20151013/maddie-ziegler-2015-what-s-inside-the-million-dollar-house-of-the-reality-star-and-young-dancer.htm", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmCBJOsNQVE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdp11u-oVY4", "http://www.bustle.com/articles/90863-maddie-zieglers-sia-video-on-dance-moms-brought-out-the-worst-in-the-parents", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVBS1swmKy8"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:08:13.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
