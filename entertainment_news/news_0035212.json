It’s kind of exciting to be part of one of those posters I had in my bedroom when I was a kid. I like R2-D2 and C-3PO and Chewbacca.” \nThere had been speculation that the actor is in line to play a villain, but he remains tight-lipped over his role.

The pair previously worked together on The Wolfman in 2010. \n“I think Emily and I work in a very similar way. She’s not afraid to stop you if she doesn’t understand what’s going on and ask questions, and look for that truth… so it’s nice to work with someone that kind of goes about the same way as you do. That way you don’t feel alone,” he said. \n“We’ve known each other now for some time so there’s an element of trust that makes it easy to be silly and make a fool of yourself.” \nBenicio plays CIA agent Alejandro Gillick, who makes some questionable choices, in Denis Villeneuve’s movie. \n“The characters are compelling because as I read it, I understood what motivated him, and why he was doing what he was doing, but then I was repulsed by some of the actions,” the actor explained. \n“I feel I’ve never really played that type of character driven by revenge so the script, the character, made me get excited.” Share article \nSicario is in cinemas now.
