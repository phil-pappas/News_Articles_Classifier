Starring Emma Roberts, the rising star niece of Julia Roberts, it's set in an American university where sorority Tau has recovered from catastrophic events in 1995 when a party ended in tragedy. It's ruled with an iron fist by Chanel Oberlin (Roberts), however, all hell breaks loose when Dean Cathy Munsch decrees that sorority pledging must be open to all female students, and not just the school's silver-spooned elite. To make matters much worse, a killer disguised as a devil begins wreaking havoc across the campus on the 20th anniversary of the fateful party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:07:53.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
