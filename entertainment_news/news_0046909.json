TRAMON WILLIAMS\nHe's now part of team lore, filed under Goes Down In Cleveland annals as “crazy ways the Browns lose.” You just can’t jump offsides when the opponent is attempting a possible game-winning field goal. You just can’t.\nLATAVIUS MURRAY\nJust when the Oakland Raiders were gaining some momentum, their top running back hurts their cause badly with two fumbles (one lost) and just 49 yards on 16 carries. And that was against a Chicago Bears defense that began the day ranked 28th against the run.\nJOSH SCOBEE\nThe now former Pittsburgh Steeler set the tone for Week 4 — where kicking ranged from bad to terrible. And, yeah, we know it’s not nice to kick a guy on his way out the door. But we wanted to make sure he knew — no paycheck and no participation trophy.\nUSA TODAY\nPelissero: Stephen Ross needs to take all-or-nothing approach to Dolphins brass\nNDAMUKONG SUH\nAlong with Scobee, a repeat winner. After Sunday's no-show, at least Suh didn’t have to worry about finding room in his luggage for a trophy on the flight home from London.\nJAMEIS WINSTON\nSince we're picking on an unemployed kicker, we think it's OK to pick on a rookie QB.
