We told him there were cameras here, right?\" the host quipped. \"Are Tuesday nights the nights he volunteers down at the orphanage?\" \"His people called late last night and canceled on us. They were cryptic as to why he canceled. They said he has a major political commitment. But he did want me to relay the message to you that if he had been here, he would have been great. I'm dying to find out what this major political commitment was,\" Kimmel joked. \"Usually, it means he had to go on CNN and call someone an idiot or something.\" \"Don't worry,\" the comedian added. \"Tonight, we're going to give everyone in the audience a basketball dipped in cologne, so you can fully experience what it would have been like had Donald Trump been here.\" He went on. \"The good part about Donald Trump not being here is we don't have to build a wall around Guillermo tonight,\" as he referred to his Mexican sidekick. Trump was supposed to be Kimmel's guest along with Jay-Z during the episode. \"Unfortunately Mr. Trump now has a political obligation that will prevent him from joining as planned,\" his spokesperson told Variety, \"but we have rescheduled to join in-studio in L.A. over the next few weeks.\" Despite Trump's absence, \" Jimmy Kimmel Live! \" was full of stars that night as the host took fans to Barclays Center where Tidal concert was held with Beyonce Knowles , Nicki Minaj , and Lil Wayne among the performers. Jay-Z also treated Kimmel's audience to live performances . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:52:56.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
