Voxx's “Hands On Me' video is nominated for Best Music Video in the San Pedro International Film Festival at the Warner Grand Theater. The San Pedro International Film Festival was founded to showcase films and enlighten audiences while providing invaluable exposure for filmmakers, local and international.\n“Hands On Me” has already received nominations and wins all over the globe in Puerto Rico, Spain, France, and New York, including at the Los Angeles New Wave Film Festival for Best Music Video, Best Director and Best Cinematographer, the worldwide Best Of Shorts Competition, and recently, at the Cinerockom International Film Festival in Beverly Hills.\nFor the video, Voxx teamed up with director Carlos A. Hurtado, who has won over 30 national and international awards, including winning this year at the highly respected Cannes Film Festival for \"Hollygrove.\"\nThe concept for the music video is a dream within a dream, with Voxx searching to find the perfect girl. He was inspired for “Hands On Me” from the hit film “Inception,” which starred Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\"We also drew from other artists like Justin Timberlake's video with Jay-Z 'Holy Grail,'” Voxx said. The video features Jaysin Voxx driving a high performance Lotus Evora, singing on rooftops and helicopter pads, and several high fashion dream sequences.\nThe wardrobe worn by Voxx and the dancers in the music video features the exotic haute-couture styles from fashion powerhouse Sachika. Sachika, founded in 2009, has been featured in Elle, Italian Vogue and numerous other fashion magazines. The twin Sachika sisters, To-Tam and To-Nya, have dressed many TV and movie stars, including Vanessa Simmons, Adrienne Bailon and Patti Stanger of Millionaire Matchmaker, as well as many Billboard chart topping artists like Nicki Minaj and now Jaysin Voxx.\nJaysin Voxx is now back in the studio working on a new project with D3 Entertainment. Voxx's new album will include collaborations with P.e.b. Rocks (Boi-1da, Heat Squad Muzik), Price Tag of Audio Push (Interscope) and Phillip Peterson (Benny Blanco, Trey Songz, Lupe Fiasco, Ed Sheeran, A$AP Rocky and Adam Levine).\nVoxx was introduced to D3 and Loyalty Lane through a mutual friend from eOne Music and when they heard his music, it was obvious they wanted to work with him.\n“When I heard his music, I told myself that this guy is dope. Then when I met him, I was even more blown away on how humble and business savvy he was,” D3 said. “Jaysin brings a hunger and tenacity back to music that has been absent. I'm glad to be a part of what he brings. I know that Jaysin Voxx will be the voice of 2016 and beyond.”\nWatch the \"Hands On Me!\" video: http://smarturl.it/Hands_On_Me_YouTube\nVisit the Official Website: http://www.JaysinVoxx.com\n###\nContacts:\nStephanie DeGraw, Power Media Entertainment & PR\nOffice: 702.907.9109, Cell: 801.638.9410\nstephanie(at)powermediaentertainment(dot)com\nBookings: nosleepmuzik(at)gmail(dot)com\nJay\nJ\nBooking inquiries: nosleepmusik(at)gmail(dot)com\nhttp://www.jaysinvoxx.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5KYXlzaW5Wb3h4LmNvbQ==", "http://smarturl.it/Hands_On_Me_YouTube", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qYXlzaW52b3h4LmNvbQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3NtYXJ0dXJsLml0L0hhbmRzX09uX01lX1lvdVR1YmU="], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:58:34.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
