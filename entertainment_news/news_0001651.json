Simon Cowell and the Overs (ITV pictures) \nIn this part of boot camp, each judge chooses six acts to take through to Judges’ Houses by granting one a seat on stage if they are considered good enough. \nWhen all six chairs are taken, if a better choice comes along, a seated contestant can be swapped out of their chair – and possibly out of the ITV singing series. \nSimon also reversed his stance on Kent teacher Tonatha Raihan. The 28-year-old was un-seated, seated and finally un-seated as she made way for singer Bupsi from Leeds. \nBupsi’s rendition of Respect by Aretha Franklin was not the best vocally, but the 37-year-old did enough to go through to Judges’ Houses at Tonatha’s expense. \nJoining Bupsi in the next stage is Max Stone, a 27-year-old musician who was the first of the Overs to be seated thanks to his version of Bob Marley’s Turn Your Lights Down Low. Promoted stories \nHowever, the Londoner lost his seat and endured a long wait before he won it back when Simon had a change of heart at the very end of the episode. \n“Max, I want to apologise. I don’t think I was fair to you. I think you have got a voice and I have learned to listen to the audience,” he told the relieved singer songwriter. \nThe X Factor supremo, who has previously lashed out against being “stuck” with the Overs, had harsh words for finalist Anton Stephens. Anton on The X Factor (ITV) \nSimon complained that the 44-year-old from London, who sang the Luther Vandross hit A House Is Not A Home, pulled “weird faces” when he performed. \nContestant Anton replied: “But if you’re a bit poor like me, and your friends are poor, and you can’t afford Botox, your face kind of moves.” \nThe quip left Simon in fits of laughter, alongside fellow judges Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Nick Grimshaw, and Rita Ora. \nBacking singer Anton will have to compete against Ebru, Jennifer Phillips and Kerrie-Ann Phillips (no relation) at Judges’ Houses for a place in the live shows. Kerrie-Ann Phillips (ITV) \nThe trio of female singers enjoyed as smooth a passage to the competition’s next stage as it’s possible to get in the dreaded Six Chair Challenge. \nCompared to Simon and his Overs, judge Cheryl’s only real dilemma centred around two gospel groups in her category. As if that was not enough, it was also sibling versus sibling. Silvertone’s Rachel McIntosh was up against her brother Nathan, a member of Bekln. \nOn the night, the girl group were judged to have out-sung the boy band with their soulful rendition of Sam Cooke’s A Change Is Gonna Come. However, both groups are through to Judges’ Houses. \nCheryl’s final six also includes Menn On Point, Alien, The First Kings and Filipino sibling sensations 4th Power. \nNext weekend’s Judges’ Houses sees the return of Mason Noise following contestant Tom Bleasby’s decision to quit. \nThe 21-year-old hopeful was originally booted out of the competition for rowing with Simon over the length of his Six Chair Challenge audition. He will rejoin Nick’s boys. \nJudges’ Houses also includes appearances from guest mentors All About That Bass star Meghan Trainor, singer Jess Glynne, producer Mark Ronson and One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson. \nAired over two nights, this stage of the competition will make X Factor history as it will be the first time the final 12 are announced live.
