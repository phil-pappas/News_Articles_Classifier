I make music.\"\nJay Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, appeared calm throughout his hour-and-a-half testimony on the second day of the trial at U.S. District court in Los Angeles, saying he had assumed his producer Timbaland had created the key chorus melody in \"Big Pimpin'.\"\n\"I didn't think it was a sample. There would be no reason for me thinking to clear the song,\" he said.\nThe rapper said hundreds of people typically deal with his contracts and licensing.\nTestimony by Mosley, who goes by \"Timbaland,\" followed Jay Z's, and the hip-hop producer described composing \"Big Pimpin'.\" Timbaland said he created a rhythmic beat before adding the beginning of Hamdy's \"Khosara, Khosara\" track, which he said he found on a CD of Arabic music labeled \"license free.\"\n\"I'm thinking it's free music, free songs, and I sampled it,\" Timbaland said during his hour-and-a-half testimony.\nHe demonstrated the process in court with a keyboard that had been set up by the witness stand, recording a rap vocal and layering several sounds over it to create a brief musical piece.\nTimbaland said when his legal team alerted him to a copyright claim, he immediately asked how to solve it and was advised to pay $100,000 for the license.\n\"Legal just told me, 100 grand, and you're clear,\" Timbaland said. \"I thought I was free and clear.\"\nThe producers paid $100,000 to EMI Music Arabia to acquire the license.\nTimbaland said he had never been contacted by Osama Ahmed Fahmy, Hamdy's nephew, who filed the initial complaint, before the lawsuit. On learning of the complaint, he said, \"I was like, so who did I pay the 100 grand to?\"\nTestimony from Fahmy, who delivered his deposition by video, will be heard by the court on Wednesday.\n(Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy and Jonathan Oatis )\nRapper Jay Z arrives at a United States District Court to testify in downtown Los Angeles, California October 14, 2015.
