Yep, this is a thing now.\nThe Pokémon EXPO Gym is opening on November 19th in Osaka, and as ridiculous as it sounds, some of us(one of us) wasted a large proportion of their childhood watching the TV show, playing the card games, and glued to a Gameboy(Pokemon Blue was where it was at) so we're(I'm) well up for this.\nThe gym was created to help fans and younger gamers improve their Pokémon skills. It offers a number of training programs that all sound amazing, like Charizard’s Battle Colosseum, Gardevoir’s Control Score and Pokémon Battle Bowling.\nThose who complete the training courses will be given unique Pokémon for X, Y, Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby games, but that means absolutely nothing to us because Pokemon effectively ended with 151 of the creatures, and no later than Pokemon Yellow. For anyone who has a clue what that sentence means, feel free to help us out here.\nNow, just have a look at this place, it seems awesome.\nVia Mashable\nMORE: Watch: Cristiano Ronaldo's Japanese TV ad for a face slimming mouth stick you suck on\nMORE: The cost for a Superbowl commercial has hit a record high\nMORE: Police rescue unconscious pet shop owner from his 20-foot python's grip", "external_links": ["http://mashable.com/2015/10/23/japan-pokemon-gym/#IQl9_RjwFGqC", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mxy6abFXXmM"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:31:53.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
