Dubbed #MyToyMemory , the interactive campaign leverages social media and consumer nostalgia to raise a minimum of $50,000 in support of TIF programs that provide toys to children who are ill, impoverished, rescued from abuse, or otherwise in need.\n#MyToyMemory won first prize in TIF's recent Game On! competition, which encouraged toy companies across the industry to develop creative, compelling marketing campaigns to help raise funds so that more children in need will receive the gift of play during the holidays. The contest broke new ground for TIF and received an enthusiastic response from toy companies of all sizes.\nThe winning campaign, developed by Mattel, was selected for its ability to strike an emotional chord with consumers, encourage donations to TIF, and raise awareness about the Foundation's mission in a fresh and innovative way. Toy companies Crazy Aaron's Putty World and LEGO came in second and third place, respectively. Each of the top three companies will receive a grant in their company's name to a children's charity in their local community.\n\"We are grateful to each and every toy company that submitted their innovative ideas and showed their commitment to making a difference in the lives of little ones through magical moments of play,\" said Jean Butler , Executive Director of the Toy Industry Foundation. \"We are so excited to launch #MyToyMemory and collaborate with consumers and the entire toy industry on this first-of-its-kind fundraiser to ensure that countless children, regardless of their circumstances, make new 'toy memories' this holiday season.\"\n#MyToyMemory inspires toy lovers of all ages to share their favorite toy memories on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and to visit CrowdRise.com to make a financial donation that will help TIF bring new toys to kids in need during the holidays. Throughout the campaign, Mattel will match every dollar donated (up to $25,000 ), and other toy manufacturers and entertainment companies will be encouraged to match donations from consumers whose #MyToyMemory is associated with their brand.\n\"It's so gratifying to help give the gift of play to children in need this holiday season,\" said Lisa McKnight , Senior Vice President and Global Brand GM at Mattel. \"We're honored that #MyToyMemory was selected as the winning campaign, and we're very proud to help make a meaningful difference in the lives of so many children.\"\nGet involved with #MyToyMemory by visiting www.crowdrise.com/mytoymemory .\nAbout Toy Industry Foundation www.toyindustryfoundation.org\nThe Toy Industry Foundation (TIF) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to deliver the magic of play to children in need.
