I've been working on it for a few years at my own pace.\" \nAnd when she was asked for more information about her literary hero, she told Billboard, \"It's Clive Owen.\" \nSmith added, \"I don't like the crime or the stress of crime, (but) I like the mind of the detective.\" \nFans should expect her literary hero to bear similarities to late author Henning Mankell's troubled Kurt Wallander, who she believes is one of the greatest detective characters. \nMankell lost his battle with cancer on Monday, aged 67.
