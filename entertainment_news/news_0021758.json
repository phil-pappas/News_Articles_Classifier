Even as Sehwag was an aggressive batsman, he made a far greater impact in Test cricket. He is the only Indian batsman to have scored a triple century in Test cricket, one of the four batsmen to have reached that landmark in world cricket and also the only player apart from Sir Don Bradman to have recorded figures of 290+ in Test cricket thrice. He is also the only cricketer in the world to have scored two double centuries and grab a five-wicket haul in Test cricket \n  3:42 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:11:12.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
