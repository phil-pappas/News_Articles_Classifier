I don’t want to have to talk. They gave me one of those things, like a nomination, two or three times. A nomination is plenty.\n“The idea of winning means that you’re in competition with someone, and I’m not in competition with anybody. I just stick to my guns and do what I want to do. Sometimes people don’t like it, but that’s all right,” Depp said.\nApart from Oscar, the other thing that the “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” is allergic to is, “comeback”.\n“What did I come back from? The dead? I haven’t done anything different in this than I have in any other film,” he said.\n 15, 2015 12:55 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:16:50.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
