If users want to know the weather or the results of a sporting event they can ask Siri, and be met with a rapid reply. Siri exemplifies the rise of virtual-assistant software that mimics some of the skills of human secretaries: creating reminders for appointments, looking up information and completing other tasks.\nHutoma , a new London based start up specialised in artificial intelligence, is arguing this is not the way it’s always going to be. They believe virtual assistants can be more than just finding an ATM, conducting a web search, or deleting a calendar entry. What about having a colleague instead of a secretary? A mentor instead of a student? What about an assistant that guides users down paths less traveled? What about an assistant that aspires to help users be a better version of themselves? What about a digital companion instead of a virtual secretary?\nInspired by the famous Spike Jonze's movie, Hutoma just launched “ Project HER ”, a new Kickstarter campaign for the world first AI Digital Companion. Project HER is powered by a deep learning neural network programmed to be social and proactive with users. The underlying tech learns new concepts at every interaction and can be reprogrammed by end users with a simple text file.\nWhat Hutoma is trying to evoke here is a notion of advanced, personal software that aspires well beyond the apps and services that catch our eye today. We’re seeing little hints and signals of the future – that’s exciting!\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13040576.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214746537/her", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13040576.htm"], "published": "2015-10-24T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:09:41.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
