Enough steakhouse classics shine that it's well worth cherry-picking the standouts from an erratically executed menu. (There's plenty of potential here for another star down the line.) Note that owner Benjamin Berg, a former general manager at Houston's Smith & Wollensky, has installed a nifty butcher shop in front, where home cooks can purchase some top-of-the-line steaks dry-aged in house along with fat deli sandwiches to eat in or take out.\nMust-orders: Chef Tommy's Bacon with Roquefort and truffle honey; shrimp cocktail; tomato and onion salad with Russian dressing; wedge salad; Carpet Bagger fried oysters; crab Louie salad; dry-aged ribeye; dry-aged porterhouse for two; creamed spinach; New York cheesecake; apple crisp.\nRead the full review here .\nMedia: Gopher // B&B Butchers & Restaurant Owner Benjamin Berg talks about his newly opened restaurant.
