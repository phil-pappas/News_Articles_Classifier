On Thursday, Handler posted a picture of a cut-up pomegranate on Instagram and Twitter with the caption: \"It’s impossible to enjoy eating a pomegranate when the end result is this. #miscarriage. #cleaningupforyourcleaninglady.\" \nYikes. That's some pretty graphic and disturbing imagery to assign to a fruit, and the flip comparison could be considered insensitive on any day of the year -- but Thursday just happened to be Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, which definitely makes the whole thing a lot worse. Here's the pic: A photo posted by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) on Oct 15, 2015 at 7:56am PDT \nYou'll notice that the #miscarriage hashtag has been removed from the Instagram post. Not, however, from Handler's tweet: It&#39;s impossible to enjoy eating a pomegranate when the end result is this. #miscarriage … https://t.co/FBnGXE8yA8 &mdash; Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) October 15, 2015 \nAs we said, people are (understandably) not particularly happy with this attempt at a joke. Comments have ranged from disappointed to outraged to heartbreaking, with many referencing painful personal experiences: \"Zero respect for you now, ignorant and not funny. I lost my son last year, I hope you never have to endure similar pain,\" wrote one Twitter user. \"Well, used to be a fan, till this #miscarriageawareness\" wrote another. \nAs for Chelsea, she seems to think people are being overly sensitive about the post, and that she didn't cross any lines. In a separate Instagram caption (under a pic of her dog), she wrote: \n\"There's a thing called national miscarriage day I am just reading about myself online. I did not remove a hashtag. My asst does that when I do something bad. Me having a pomegranate and infant loss are not directly related. Jesus. Love, chunk\" \nMore from The Stir: Chelsea Handler's Body-Shaming Ex Is Feeling Pretty Dumb Right Now (PHOTO) \nTo be fair, I don't think Handler was trying to hurt anybody's feelings, or even make light of the actual experience of miscarriage or infant loss. I think she has a dark, twisted sense of humor and typically says (types) the first thing that comes into her head, as long as it's funny -- and she clearly thought this remark was. (Unfortunately, it wasn't.) \nMaybe if Handler had posted this on any other day of the year, it would have simply been unfunny, and not offensive. Again, to be fair, she clearly had no idea what day it was -- but since she knows now, maybe an apology wouldn't be such a bad idea? While I don't think Handler is really worried about offending people, I also don't believe she actually wants to make anybody feel bad or sad. And this time, she did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:59:52.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
