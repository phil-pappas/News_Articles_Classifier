Log in. Log in Terry Cullen (from left), Bob Cavallo and Bob Reitman laugh as they reminisce about the infamous Bruce Springsteen bomb scare show at the Uptown Theater. By Piet Levy of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 1, 2015 11:08 p.m. \nForty years ago Friday, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band made its explosive Milwaukee debut at the Uptown Theater. \nFortunately, the evening wasn't literally explosive. \nAbout 40 minutes into the concert, then WQFM-FM DJ Bob Reitman stepped onto the stage, Springsteen by his side, telling the 1,800 in attendance that they had to evacuate because of a bomb threat. \nThe concert resumed three hours later, with a liquored-up Springsteen leading the band through a wild set that stretched past 2 a.m. It's such a landmark concert it's being commemorated at a free event at Shank Hall on Friday, featuring stories from the show, musical tributes from local artists including John Sieger and Dan Kolesari, and free posters for attendees featuring three of photographer Robert Cavallo's pictures from the concert. \nA recording of the show also will be played; you can hear it with this story at jsonline.com/greensheet. \n\"Unlike any other concert I've seen, we didn't know what was going to happen,\" Reitman told the Journal Sentinel this week. \nAn Uptown cashier received a threatening phone call at 8:45 p.m., according to the Milwaukee Sentinel, prompting head of security Terry Cullen to meet with promoter Allan Dulberger and Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, who collectively decided to stop the concert for three hours while police \"tore the theater apart,\" Cullen told the Journal Sentinel this week. \nNo bomb was found. \nThe concertgoers left peacefully, most of them waiting in a nearby parking lot in the cold. Springsteen and the band, meanwhile, hung out at the Pfister Hotel bar, where Springsteen later told the crowd they were \"drinking our skulls out.\" \n\"We said, 'Bartender, somebody tried to blow us up tonight,'\" Springsteen said to the crowd, like a slap-happy preacher, part of a rambling monologue that kicked off a killer cover of Chuck Berry's \"Little Queenie.\" \"He looked at me and said, 'Son, son, are you loose?'\" \nSpringsteen busted out laughing, hilariously repeating the phrase over and over throughout the night. \nBut the Boss wasn't so wasted that he blew the concert. \n\"They came out like the Packers going to a Super Bowl game,\" Reitman recalled. \"You had a sense that they were on the cusp, and knew already things were going to get huge.\" \n\"Born to Run\" had come out that August, and Springsteen ended up on the covers of both Time and Newsweek later that month. \nListening to the Uptown recording, you can practically hear Springsteen's ascent to superstardom on \"Jungleland,\" bellowing out his poetic verses with heartfelt gusto, before retreating near the climax to a mesmerizing whisper. And Clarence Clemons \"practically took over the stage\" that night, Cullen recalled, his blustering sax solos providing the showstopping finish for the night's final song, \"Quarter to Three.\" \n\"Pulling a stocking cap over his eyes, ripping out a guitar duel with a member of his band, jumping offstage and plunging into the audience, Springsteen has a jubilant enthusiasm that goes beyond the usual dreary stage theatrics,\" Damien Jaques wrote in his review for The Milwaukee Journal. \n\"The new rock messiah has been found.\" THE SETLIST FROM THE BOMB SCARE SHOW \n1. \"Meeting Across the River\" \n2. \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" \n3. \"Spirit in the Night\" \n4. \"Pretty Flamingo\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:31:51.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
