Steven Moffat (Ian West/PA) \nDoctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat, who will be an executive producer on the programme, said: “No one has documented the dark and exhilarating world of the teenager like Patrick Ness, and now we’re bringing his brilliant story-telling into Doctor Who.” \nHe teased: “This is growing up in modern Britain – but with monsters!” \nClass, which will consist of eight 45-minute episodes, will film in and around Wales from next spring before being shown on BBC Three later in the year.
