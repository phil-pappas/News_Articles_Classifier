By Bill Dawers As many of you already know, there was another tragedy on the road to Tybee. I didn’t know Susan Allen Bartoletti, but obviously extend my condolences to her family and friends.\nBartoletti passed away last Thursday night after a wreck on the Bull River Bridge, which has seen its share of tragedies in recent years.\nSince her passing, the long-simmering frustration about the dangerous road has given way to outright anger and calls for public action to make U.S. 80 safer.\nAs I write this, the Facebook group #fixhwy80now #4lanetybeeroad has more than 4,000 members, and the page is brimming with energy.\nThe second half of the name of that Facebook group — #4lanetybeeroad — reflects the general public sentiment for four lanes from Tybee Island to the mainland.\nBut it’s worth keeping in mind that a four lane road with new bridges at Bull River and at Lazaretto Creek would cost far more than $100 million and could take years of environmental review.\nSome will immediately object to any concern about costs. How can you put a price tag on human life?\nThe truth is we make life-and-death decisions all the time in our government budgets. Officials are often well aware of projects that would make roads safer, but they don’t have the resources to act.\nA proposed four-lane road to Tybee Island was taken off the table a number of years ago because of the extreme cost. Tybee has a resident population of just 3,000, after all, and throughout much of the year there is no justification for two lanes each way.\nAnd is a four-lane road, which would encourage vastly higher speeds, even the safest option?\nIf you go to the Metropolitan Planning Commission website, you can take a look at the “U.S. 80 Bridges Replacement Study,” which was completed in 2012. The plan would dramatically improve the road by adding safe shoulders and multi-use paths to the bridges, creating usable shoulders between the bridges and adding turn lanes at critical points.\nThe details of that plan were released after the 2012 TSPLOST vote, but the general concepts were already being discussed beforehand. That 1 percent sales tax would have created a timetable and put money in the pipeline for improving Highway 80, but voters throughout the region — including 57 percent in Chatham County — soundly defeated the tax.\nI don’t have space here to go into all the funding issues, so I’ll just say that it seems unlikely to me that the state of Georgia will put improvements to the Tybee road on the fast track.\nIf we want to do something, we’ll likely have to come up with the funding ourselves, and that likely means supporting other projects that are valued by other area residents.\nCity Talk appears every Sunday and Tuesday.
