Carrie Underwood Describes 'American Idol' Experience As \"The Most Horrifying Thing\" Carrie Underwood American Idol \nThe country star first found fame on the reality competition back in 2005. \nCountry star Carrie Underwood has described her time on ‘ American Idol ’ as, “the most horrifying thing.” The 32 year old shot to fame after winning the fourth season of the reality series in 2005, but says the experience of competing on the Fox show was scary, as she was all by herself for the first time. Carrie Underwood has described her time on ‘American Idol’ as “the most horrifying thing.” \nSpeaking to Parade magazine, Underwood said, “Idol was probably the most horrifying thing, because I had never been away from my hometown like that before. I was in L.A., of all places, by myself, putting myself out there, which is a scary thing for anybody to do.\" \n“My first plane ride was when I was going out to L.A. alone. I always kept in my head, If nothing else ever comes of this, I got to do the coolest thing ever and I won American Idol.” \nMore: Carrie Underwood Broke Into Her Own Car To Rescue Her Son & Dogs \n“I was like, OK, I will just have fun with this and save up as much money as I can and finish school and get a real job,” the singer added. “Because I am always a practical thinker and would never allow myself to think it would turn out OK all the time.” \nBut even after five albums and numerous world tours, Underwood still feels awkward speaking in front of a crowd. “I still haven’t figured out how to talk to the audience,” Underwood said. “I just want to sing. I am a little awkward when it comes to speaking, because I am a shy person.” \nMore: Carrie Underwood's List Of Baby Names Is Pretty “Fly\" \nBut what helps is taking to herself first. “Talking yourself up is a big thing,” she added. “People might think you are nuts talking to yourself and telling yourself how awesome you are, but it helps to say, ‘I am strong.’” Underwood has just released her fifth studio album, Storyteller , which is described as more traditionally county than some of her previous releases. \nEarlier this year the singer welcomed her first child with husband Mike Fisher, a boy named Isaiah, Speaking about her son Underwood said, “Isaiah is a morning person and neither one of us are. He is super-smiley and chatty already—it is gibberish—but neither of us talk too much. I don’t know who Isaiah is like or what he’s got, but he is just a little ray of sunshine.” Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:27:13.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
