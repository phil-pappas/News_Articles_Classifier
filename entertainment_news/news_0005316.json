Montag and her now-husband, Spencer Pratt , were vilified during their time on the MTV series, and the star claimed their portrayal was Conrad's doing.\n\"I spent years pretending to like her for a living,\" she revealed. \"It was literally my job to deal with her, and it wasn't pleasant ... The fact is, she lied about my and tried to destroy my life, yet I was the one painted as the villain so the show could have her as the good guy.\"\n\"It's not that I care about [Lauren] anymore, but it is upsetting to me that everyone knows by now that The Hills was a scripted show, yet people still think the negative stuff about me that the show set up to make me the villain to her hero was real,\" she added. \"It's bizarre.\"\nMontag and Conrad co-starred on five seasons of The Hills , with the latter departing after season 5. Pratt admitted to leaking word of Conrad's sex tape in an interview with Complex published this week, but had similar complaints about the designer as Montag.\n\"Lauren is a cold-hearted killer,\" he told the publication. \"That's what people don't get. She will cut you in your sleep. She tried to destroy us. If you want to throw missiles, I'm throwing a nuke. This is how I operate.\"\nMontag and Pratt have been together since 2006, and eloped in November 2008. The couple have since appeared on the reality shows I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! , Marriage Boot Camp , Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Wife Swap .\n Lauren Conrad bans potential body-shaming terms from website Kristin Cavallari, Audrina Patridge reunite at NYFW Kristin Cavallari reveals she's expecting baby girl Heidi Montag declares she's done with plastic surgery", "external_links": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/heidi-montag-lauren-conrad-spent-years-pretending-like-her-20151510", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/spencer-pratt-heidi-montag-after-the-hills", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:39:57.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
