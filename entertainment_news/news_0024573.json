He also will share humorous stories and amazing footage from his adventures all around the world from Africa to the Amazon to Antarctica and beyond. As always, Hanna mixes his passion with dedication to wildlife conservation. \nAudiences can expect to see approximately 15 animals in the live experience; the exact animals to appear will not be confirmed until soon before the show, since each animal must receive medical clearance; however, fans can expect to see animals such as a baby cheetah, kangaroo, baby tiger, two-toed sloth, penguin and much more. \nHanna has made countless television appearances on shows such as “Good Morning America,” “Ellen” and “The Late Show with David Letterman,” where he made more than 100 appearances and appeared as one of the featured guests for Letterman’s final episodes earlier this year. In 2013, Hanna celebrated his 35th “Hanna-versary” as Director Emeritus with the Columbus Zoo. \nIn 1993, Hanna became the host of “Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures,” a nationally syndicated television series that ran for more than 10 years. In October 2007, his current TV series, “Jack Hanna's Into the Wild,” debuted. This unscripted and action-packed series shows Hanna and his family as they explore the corners of the globe and discover amazing animals and cultures. “Jack Hanna's Into the Wild” is the recipient of three Emmy Awards as Outstanding Children's Series. \nHis second and newest TV show, “Jack Hanna's Wild Countdown,” airs Saturday mornings around the country on ABC. “Wild Countdown” features some of Hanna’s favorite experiences with the world's rarest, most endearing and fascinating animals. Both television series exist because of Hanna’s longstanding partnerships with Nationwide Insurance and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, with whom he has worked with for decades to protect and spread the word about wildlife conservation. \nHanna’s Camden Opera House appearance is locally sponsored by Point Lookout Resort in Northport. Tickets can be purchased beginning 9 a.m. Nov. 4 at camdenoperahouse.com ; by phoning the box office at 470-7066; or weekdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Camden Town Office. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
