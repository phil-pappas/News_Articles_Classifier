The eyes and fangs were made of carefully painted foam-core boards. Jack o'lanterns, giant spiders and a little mood lighting completed the look.\n\"Everyone has loved it so far,\" McConnell said. \"Kids wanted to take their picture with the house while I was working on it! Tons of people driving by were stopping to take pictures. I've decorated their house before and people have always loved it, but it never got this much of a reaction.\"\nIf you're feeling sheepish about the cotton wool cobwebs outside your house, it might reassure you to know that McConnell is occupationally creative. She's already well-known for her stunning horror-themed baked goods and her first cookbook is due out soon .\nFor more of McConnell's work, you can visit her Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/christinehmcconnell/", "http://christinehmcconnell.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:26:34.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
