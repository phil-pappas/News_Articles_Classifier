He says of his novel, “The story is engraved in stones of ancient Egypt. And yet this story has never been told until now.”\nFrom a village in the Land of Goshen, a brilliant but physically challenged boy named Yoram makes his way into the heart of ancient Egypt. He witnesses the changing culture of the Children of Israel and the different mindsets of the pharaohs in power. Yoram experiences the passions and struggles that prevail as the weak new nation falls into subjugation.\nThis fascinating novel covers the history of the Hebrew nation from its peak of contentment to its descent into slavery. Through Yoram’s eyes, \"Who Knew Not Joseph\" presents an honest picture of the human side of that first holocaust.\nWatch the video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgOkzvirZ6Q&feature=youtu.be\nAbout the Author: Menachem Mannie Magid was born in in 1944 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
