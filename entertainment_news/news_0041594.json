The film had a simultaneous release in Tamil too. The Sathya director expressed his displeasure about the action-comedy entertainer on his micro blogging page after watching the movie on Friday morning. RGV said that he was so disappointed with the film that he had to watch real Bruce Lee’s Enter the Dragon for relief and wondered why Sreenu Vaitla-directed film was titled Bruce Lee. He also added that he was let down by the cameo appearance of Chiranjeevi in the film as he always wanted the Megastar to make a re-entry with a full-fledged role. RGV, in the past, has claimed several times that he is a huge fan of Chiranjeevi. After posting a series of tweets, he finally concluded by saying that he is eagerly awaiting the star’s 151st film and that Bruce Lee would have worked had the makers opted for a different title. Interestingly, Ram Gopal Varma too had announced a female-centric film titled Bruce Lee a few weeks ago, which was a surprise for movie buffs and many in the industry. It should be noted that RGV had also taken pot shots at Sreenu Vaitla’s previous film, the Mahesh Babu-starrer Aagadu.
