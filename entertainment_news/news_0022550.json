As an adult, Scribner would also become acutely aware that Dallas had suffered abuse and that she would give up anything to save him.\nWhat ensued was Scribner’s long and tumultuous battle to not only save Dallas from the shackles of abuse, but also to save herself from the past.\nOnce the victim of their father’s alcohol-fueled rages, their mother terrorized Dallas, regularly beating him, refusing to send him to school, and isolating him from the rest of the family. Meanwhile, Scribner already an adult by then was struggling to make a stable life for herself out of the chaos of her childhood. She eventually fulfilled her dream of earning a college degree, embarked on a successful career, and, in spite of the alienation and neglect that had formed her emotional landscape, found strength and support with her husband Blake. So when, in his thirties, Dallas finally gave voice to the brutality he had endured his entire life, Scribner heard his cry for help and fought to give her brother a better life.\nUntangle is a lyrical and compelling account of the ways in which we triumph over the pain of the past. At times shocking in its detail, Scribner offers a rare and dignified account of how someone with mental disabilities, whose life was profoundly shaped by abuse, broke free from its legacy. Ultimately, Untangle is a testament to the human spirit, and our capacity to show love, strength, and courage, both to ourselves and to each other, even in the face of utter cruelty.\n“Scribner actively campaigns for better treatment of persons with mental disabilities, and also to give a voice to those children suffering in silence,” says Scribner. “While we have achieved this with gusto, the book’s reach and esteem has stretched far beyond anything I could have ever imagined.”\nAside from a rapidly-growing social media following and numerous media engagements, Scribner is most proud of her official recognition from the California State Legislature.\n“After a recent book signing I was presented with a Certificate of Recognition signed by California Senator, Ted Gains. Inscribed is the statement “In recognition of your tireless efforts on behalf of those with mental disabilities.” I don’t think I could ask for a more profound accolade and I am truly touched that what started off as a series of life-ruining experiences can now be transposed into tangible efforts to help others,” she adds.\nReaders have also flocked in their droves to leave positive reviews. Brian Jones comments, “Shirlee Scribner's autobiographical story of her abusive childhood and fight to save her disabled brother will have you rapidly turning pages to find out what happens next. Shirlee tells her story without bitterness and hatred, but still manages to induce tears when recounting near-starvation, mental abuse, and neglect at the hands of her parents. The story becomes even more compelling when it turns to her mentally challenged brother and the abuse he suffers far into adulthood. Her struggles with Social Services and the court system are both fascinating and disheartening, but ultimately uplifting due to Shirlee's love for her family and faith in God.”\nFor more information about Shirlee Scribner and ‘Untangle’, please visit the official website.\n‘Untangle: You Can’t Save Others Until You Save Yourself’ is available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/1r0Dd1O .\nFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/shirleescribnerauthor?ref=br_tf\nAbout the Author:\nShirlee Scribner spent twenty years as a project manager, space planner, and interior designer of hospitals, medical office buildings, and corporate HMO offices, and through her work she created hospital environments that felt more hotel-like than institutional.
