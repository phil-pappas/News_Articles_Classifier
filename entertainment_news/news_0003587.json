But it's 1978 in Big Stone Gap, a small coal-mining town in Virginia, and Ave Maria Mulligan (Ashley Judd) matter-of-factly uses both descriptions about herself. She lives with her mother as \"Big Stone Gap\" opens, runs the pharmacy and has a longtime beau (John Benjamin Hickey) but it seems she won't be saying yes to the dress any time soon. In short order, though, Ave Maria's life is upended by loss, a decades-old secret, a family feud, the prospect of adventure and the alluring presence of coal miner Jack MacChesney (Patrick Wilson), who has a hotsy-totsy girlfriend in divorced mom Sweet Sue (Jane Krakowski). Ave Maria, whose life has been spent serving others, tries to put herself first in this blend of romance, comedy, heartache, happiness and the shackles and beneficence of small-town life. No one knows this territory like Adriana Trigiani. A native of the town, she wrote the book and its follow-ups and then the screenplay, which she directed in Big Stone Gap. She cast Judd and Wilson as the leads along with accomplished performers such as Whoopi Goldberg as Ave Maria's straight-talking friend, Anthony LaPaglia as a lawyer with wistful regrets, and Judith Ivey as Jack Mac's mother who advises: \"True love energizes you. Lust exhausts you.\" The movie works best in its quieter exchanges, goes over the top in its broader comic or confrontational moments and slides in a minor but key reconciliation that is as fast as it is fortuitous. An incident with a visiting Elizabeth Taylor, portrayed by Wilson's wife Dagmara Dominczyk, was inspired by real life, by the way. \"Big Stone Gap\" might have fared better as a TV movie where its folksy, heartfelt charm might feel right at home. *** \"Big Stone Gap\" Starring: Ashley Judd, Patrick Wilson, Whoopi Goldberg Rating: PG-13 for brief suggestive material Running time: 1:43", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:41:21.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
