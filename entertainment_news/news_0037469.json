It said his cooking has \"continued to go from strength to strength\".\n(Reporting by Michael Roddy; Editing by Mark Heinrich)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-23T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:07:52.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
