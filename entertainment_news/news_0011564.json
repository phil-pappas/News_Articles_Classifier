Julie Albers, a favorite guest artist, plays Dvorak; Joseph Downing, local composer, makes a major musical statement of faith, and Heather Buchman, conductor, brings family favorites to the Kids Series for Halloween.\nHere is a look at Symphoria's October highlights:\nAward-winning cellist featured \"Albers Returns,\" at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 10 in the Crouse-Hinds Theater of the Mulroy Civic Center, spotlights the prize-winning artist playing Antonin Dvorak's majestic \"Concerto for Cello and Orchestra\" in B minor. She will perform on an 1872 Vuillaume cello. The audience can expect to hear gorgeous melodies interpreted with deep sensitivity to the full range of the composer's emotions with an overall emphasis on the optimism that transcends the more sorrowful passages.\n\"Julie was featured with Symphoria in May 2012, and we've all been eager to perform with her again,\" Jon Gardner, assistant director, says.\nArtistic Director Lawrence Loh will conduct the concert, which will open with Mozart's \"Overture to Don Giovanni.\" Closing the program is Rachmaninoff's brilliantly orchestrated \"Symphonic Dances,\" a late work that Loh says is \"thrilling\" and indicative of the composer's heart.\n\"Credo\" a statement of faith Composer Joseph Downing, a professor at Setnor School of Music, says he followed the conservative religion of his youth with all his heart until he was in his 30s.\n\"Then, in order to just survive as a gay person, I had to reject what had been closest to me,\" he says. \"So, realizing that I have written a major religious work and titled it simply 'Credo,' which means I believe, is a matter of astonishment to me. In spite of all the pain and rejection, I do still believe.\"\nMore than 170 vocalists from the Syracuse University Oratorio Society and massed choirs from six local churches will perform with Symphoria to present \"Credo\" at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 16 at Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception . John Warren, director of choral activities at Setnor, will conduct the special event concert.\n\"John is just a fabulous musician,\" Downing says. \"Everything he does in conducting is eminently musical. My work is done, so I look forward to sitting in the audience and listening.\" Completing \"Credo,\" which has been germinating since he composed the first segment in his college days, became possible when Downing received a grant through the New York State Council on the Arts through the Syracuse University Connective Corridor.\n\"Credo,\" while a major religious work, does not conform to any standard format, such as a mass or a requiem. Rather, it takes inspiration from Brahms and other Classical composers, but it follows a loose structure of prayers, praise songs and pure music in three movements: past, present and future.\nThe audience should listen for touches of lightness and humor in the lyrics of the one-hour performance. And, Downing says, \"In at least one of the movements, you are going to hear notes—actual pitches – that you have never heard before, notes that are generally reserved for jazz.\"\nStorybook Halloween A costume parade in the auditorium of Inspiration Hall, James Street; an instrument petting zoo, and refreshments are all part of the opening concert of Symphoria's Kids Series at 10:30 a.m. Oct. 24. Heather Buchman will conduct the one-hour performance that opens with \"Dance of the Buffoons\" by Rimsky-Korsakov.\nThe macabre \"Funeral March\" from Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 7\" will be paired with Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\" for a chilling multi-media experience., and the concert will close with family-concert favorite \"Peter and the Wolf.\"\nTickets to all regularly scheduled Symphoria concerts, including the Kids Series, are free to those 18 and younger.\nTo purchase tickets for any October concert, call 299-5598; go to the Symphoria website, or visit the box office at 234 Harrison St. from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/maps/XiDtYkLtQmn", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfZZCqm6CnI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Wk0PTTvs9Q"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:49:40.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
