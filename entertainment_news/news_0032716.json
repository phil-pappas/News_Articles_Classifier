There's Walker Assault on Hoth, Drop Zone on Sullust and Survival Mission on Tatooine.The full game, meanwhile, is set to launch on November 20 for PS4, Xbox One and PC.Star Wars Battlefront beta: Everything you need to know to sign up and start playing on PS4, Xbox One and PCCheck out our most anticipated games of October, one of many videos in Digital Spy's dedicated Gaming YouTube channel.
