That conjecture enabled some outlets to digitally wonder if the actor who was cast to play ' Adam Newman ' in 2014 would be leaving ' The Young and the Restless '. However, no evidence exists in this regard.\nPhoto by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images View all 6 photos A variety of daytime actors have also worked on nighttime shows through the years. Eileen Davidson ('Ashley') has split time between YR and NBC's 'Days of our Lives' ('Kristen') in recent years. Among others, former YR star Victoria Rowell ('Drucilla') immediately comes to mind as well. She worked on CBS' 'Diagnosis Murder' from 1993-2002, while also remaining on YR at the time. So, those precedents prove that career multitasking is possible.\nYR allowed time to pass after the unexpected removal of Michael Muhney from its cast in December 2013. An extensive casting call was conducted, which resulting in Hartley's hiring. He then debuted as the facially reconstructed 'Adam' (alias 'Gabriel Bingham') last November.\nYR's specific choice of Hartley served to neutralize a fierce social media war that was waged by fans who railed against Muhney's removal and then urged his rehire, which the actor himself said nearly occurred. This scribe felt that Muhney's efforts were comparable to those of the late, great Michael Zaslow . He was known for various soap opera roles, most notably his indelible portrayal of 'Roger Thorpe' on CBS' Guiding Light.\nExcept for the hardest of hardcore devotees, most fans of YR have accepted Hartley in Muhney's former spot. Hartley's version of 'Victor, Junior' hasn't intended to copy Muhney's unique, frenetic pathos. Instead, this solid actor is carving a new niche into a magnetic character. Full credit is offered to YR's writing staff for allowing another compelling version of 'Adam' to flow through his deep talent reserves.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Hartleyjustin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/", "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/10/04/cbs-is-looking-for-a-new-macgyver-and-weve-found-him/", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/actor-michael-zaslow-dies/", "http://michaelmuhney.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:44:47.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
