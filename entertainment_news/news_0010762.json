The Gates-based grocer announced on Monday that it's planning to build a new 120,000-square-foot store near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\nThe store, similar in size and design to other new stores, will anchor a mixed-use project developed by High Real Estate Group LLC called The Crossings at Conestoga Creek near Lancaster in Manheim Township.\nWegmans said the store could employ as many as 550 workers and is expected to open in 2018, pending various approvals.\n\"Lancaster residents have been asking us to build a store for a long time,\" Ralph Uttaro, Wegmansâ€™ senior vice president of real estate, said in a statement. \"In fact, we know that many now travel to our other locations to shop. Now we will be able to bring incredible customer service, help with meals, and consistent low prices to them.\"\nWegmans currently operates a total of 87 stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts, and has plans to open several stores in those areas in the coming years.\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:33:25.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
