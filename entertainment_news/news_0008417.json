The idea is for Devils fans to nominate friends and family members who they believe make a difference in their communities. The winner, who will be chosen in April, will get two tickets to all Prudential Center events happening between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017.\n\"We want to amplify the good work people are doing everyday,\" Devils and Prudential Center President Hugh Weber said in a phone interview about the contest, which is being run in conjunction with Prudential Financial.\nMORE: Meet the NJ Devils' Zamboni ice man\n\"We want our center to be a home away from home...(so) we want to recognize these people by literally giving them a key.\"\nThe tickets will include passes to all of the Devils games, as well as to all of the concert and entertainment events at the venue. Though no shows have yet been announced for that time, Prudential Center officials said they should be on par with this year's lineup, which includes upcoming performances from Stevie Wonder, Janet Jackson, and The Who.\nThe contest is one of many new initiatives the arena will officially be rolling out on opening night. Friday's pre-game show will include a new version of the 3D ice video that debuted last season (preview above), combined with live performances. Fans will also be treated to renovated lounges, new concession options (like the new David Burke \"Handwich Shop\"), a renovated area for \"little Devils,\" and flex memberships for season ticket holders.\nThe players will get the star treatment this year, walking into the arena on a red carpet set up starting at the corner of Mulberry Street and Edison Place. Fans who arrive early will get to see players walk the carpet at about 4:15 p.m.\nAll of the changes, Weber said, are reflective of the team's character.\n\"We are a young team,\" he said. \"We are fast and we have a lot of energy, (so) we want fans to feel that energy at games, and be (more engaged) with the players.\"\nThe Devils face off against the Winnipeg Jets at 7 p.m.\nJessica Mazzola may be reached at jmazzola@njadvancemedia.com .
