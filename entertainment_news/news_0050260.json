(AP) -- It's a role \"Scary Lucy\" was born to play: Frightening people at Halloween.\nA bronze statue of Lucille Ball that drew worldwide scorn earlier this year for its unflattering depiction of the \"I Love Lucy\" star has provided inspiration for an annual haunted house event in a mall near her western New York town.\nEvent planner Scott Mekus says an actor portraying the statue will be part of the Chautauqua Mall's \"Haunting at the Mall\" during weekends through Halloween.\nThe life-size statue was unveiled in 2009 in a park in the village of Celoron, on Chautauqua Lake. In April, a statue replacement campaign launched on Facebook gained renewed interest in the wake of local media stories on the statue, which was called Scary Lucy for its grimace-like facial features.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:12:14.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
