Credit: Aardman Animations Bristol's Aardman Animations have given fans a first look at their rather unusual Christmas special.\nShaun made his debut in Nick Park's A Close Shave in 1995. He's since gone on to star in his own TV series and his own movie. This summer Shaun statues could be seen all across Bristol and London as the Shaun in the City trail took to the streets. The Farmer's Llamas will be his first 30-minute special - and it's set to air this Christmas.\nBut true to form, Aardman haven't conformed to tradition. Reindeer have been replaced by Hector, Fernando and Raul - a flock of llamas who get tangled up in Shaun's adventures.\nLast updated Wed 21 Oct 2015 Entertainment Aardman Shaun the Sheep Bristol", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:41:24.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
