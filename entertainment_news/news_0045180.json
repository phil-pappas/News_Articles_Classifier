Nurturing new works takes time and manpower and I am thrilled that the GEVA puts such an important emphasis on new works. Their Festival of New Theatre is your opportunity to experience new works in their incubation period and meet the people that create them. Geva presents FREE \"concert readings\" of plays with professional actors followed by a conversation with the playwright. I'm directing one next Sunday 11/25 and hope to catch as many of the rest as an audience member. The Schedule:\nCRY IT OUT by Molly Smith Metzler (Oct. 23 @ 7pm) New mom Jessie is in desperate need of a friend. When she learns that her neighbor Lina is also on maternity leave, she invites her for coffee and, despite their wildly different economic status, they become fast friends. STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR by Andrea Lepcio (Oct. 24 @ 3pm) Miriam and Zameer meet at a party, and it's love at first sight. When Zameer tells Miriam that he's been living in the U.S. illegally, she offers to help - but that turns out to be more dangerous than she imagined. FAULT LINES by George Sapio. (Oct. 25 @ 7pm) This is the one I am directing. Three sisters gather each week for a family dinner even though years of sibling rivalry threaten to derail their attempts to get along. SEPARATE ROOMS by Joe Calarco (Oct. 26 – 7pm) Rochester-born Joe Calarco's newest work. A mysterious woman hides in a closet while a marriage hits the rocks and the downstairs neighbor crashes the party, looking for love. DROWNED by Bill Capossere (Oct. 28 – 7pm) Winner of Geva’s 2015 Regional Writers Showcase. How do neighbors deal with loss, mortality, and guilt after a tragic accident? All readings and events are FREE and take place in the Fielding Stage. reserve your tickets now, or call the box office: (585) 232-4382 or order at the Geva web site: http://www.gevatheatre.org/shows/festival-of-new-theatre-2015/\nRalph Meranto Blogger: Rochester arts: Taking you behind the scenes...on stage...and in my head.
