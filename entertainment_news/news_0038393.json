I'm going to be going into a 90 day treatment program to fix myself and to understand the traumas of my mind. I love and appreciate you all so much. I of course will post before I go into treatment.

I can't tell you how much your support and kind comments mean to me. I love you all so much and if I can help just one person by sharing my struggles and how I'm battling them than its all completely worth it. It's been bad for me the last three years and I've had failed attempts at suicide. I really just want to live and love and be filled with Joy. I'm on the long and arduous path to find such things. I'm here for any and all that are struggling through the same issues and I read every post good and bad. I'm not perfect and I'm the first to admit that I've made mistakes but I'm trying and will continue to try until I lm not walking this earth anymore. I love you all so much. Even the naysayers. I just have love.\"\nWishing you all the best, Nicky.\nMORE: Xander from Buffy The Vampire Slayer's been arrested again for allegedly ''choking'' his girlfriend\nMORE: Scott Disick admits himself to rehab for drug and alcohol addiction\nMORE: Turns out there was a Buffy / Angel easter egg in Avengers: Age of Ultron", "external_links": ["http://t.co/ri7QCvb8hd", "https://www.facebook.com/nicholasbrendon/posts/10153671568765320", "http://t.co/QuMMk3QFfu", "https://twitter.com/people/status/656117624150077440"], "published": "2015-10-20T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:34:21.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
