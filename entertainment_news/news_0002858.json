If anything, I'm sure they were commended for being fierce and tactical, while I was busy worrying about coming across as a brat and not getting my fair share,\" she writes.\nShe acknowledges that she has sometimes been too focused on being nice when it comes to the bottom line of the movie business.\n\"When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d**ks, I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself,\" she writes. \"I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn't want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don't need.\"\nEven when she has been firmer, she's noticed that, as a woman, she's looked at differently. In one case she mentioned, \"blunt\" talk with a colleague led to him addressing her \"as if I was yelling at him.\"\nStill, she writes, it's time to lean in -- harder.\n\"I'm over trying to find the 'adorable' way to state my opinion and still be likable!\" she says. \"F**k that.\"\nLawrence has reteamed with Cooper and \"Hustle\" director David O. Russell for \"Joy,\" due for release December 25. The final \"Hunger Games\" movie, \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,\" comes out November 20.", "external_links": ["http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a5b04a26aae05a24bc4efb63e&id=64e6f35176&e=1ba99d671e#wage", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/12/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-jennifer-lawrence-is-paid-less-than-her-male-co-stars.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:17:00.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
