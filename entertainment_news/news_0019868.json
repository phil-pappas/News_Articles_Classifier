Apparently, Simbu also called Vishal a 'fox' while commenting on his stance on the Nadigar Sangam issue, saying Vishal has been doing things that only a sly fox would do, and that he has been trying to divide the actors who have been like one big family so far.\nQuite contrary to Simbu, who was very aggressive and emotional while speaking, Vishal is pretty much unperturbed by all the allegations the Vaalu actor has made regarding him. When we called him, he asked us, \"I had a hearty laugh when I listened to Simbu's speech. What else can I say?\"\nHe added, \"I will continue with my efforts as far as the Nadigar Sangam elections are concerned, and will continue to fight for the justice.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:25:11.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
