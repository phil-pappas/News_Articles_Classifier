Laxmi plays a foreigner married to a Malayali, played by Biju Menon. In all her films, including her first, Big B, she has been cast as a foreigner. In a quick chat, Laxmi talks about how she wants to be cast as an Indian character and her love for Malayalam movies.\nAfter Bangalore Days have you been getting offers from Malayalam films? What attracted you to the film Olappeeppi ? After Bangalore Days I was approached for the Tamil version of the same movie, which I did. That was followed by Salt Mango Tree by Rajesh Nair, in which I am acting with Saiju Kurup. The next film I signed was Olappeeppi by Krish Kaimal. The story of the film and the opportunity to work with a senior actor like Biju Menon was what attracted me to the project. My first meeting with the director went very well and I felt comfortable with the project.\nWere you always interested in films? How are you finding the experience in general and Malayalam cinema in particular? From childhood I have been a dancer and was attracted to all forms of acting. I used to dream about being part of cinema. My first brush with cinema was at the age of 16, in Amal Neerad's Big B. It was quite unexpected, and years later, Amal sir remembered me and suggested my name to Anwar Rasheed for Bangalore Days. So now the dream continues and I am very thankful for this opportunity. I enjoy the experience of being part of the industry a lot.\nHow is your character like in Olappeeppi and how is Biju Menon as a co-actor? My character is an American woman called Helena who is married to a Malayali. I have great admiration for Biju Menon and always liked his acting. So for me each minute is a chance to learn from him, by observing him. He is a very down-to-earth and kind person.\nFuture plans in cinema? What is coming up in the dance front? Olappeeppi shoot is going on while work on Salt Mango Tree is already over. I am impatiently waiting for the response of the audience and the professionals about my work. I am now looking forward to play the character of an Indian heroine. That's my ambition at the moment. I will be performing for the Sangeetha Natak Akademi during the Rasavikalpam festival in the beginning of November with my husband. We will be performing our classical duet fusion of Kathakali and Bharatanatyam called Sangamam 'Krishna Mayam '. I am also working on a jugalbandhi with Odissi dancer Abhayalakshmi , a Malayali based in Bangalore and a disciple of Sharmila Mukherjee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:29:10.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
