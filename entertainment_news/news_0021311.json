Employees told 911 dispatchers that Odom used cocaine on Saturday -- his first day at the brothel -- though Hof insisted Saturday that any drug use happened when Odom was partying early that morning in Las Vegas but before he'd arrived at the Love Ranch. \"I'm going to protect my business, and I'm not going to let the world say that Lamar was doing a lot of drugs in my place,\" he told CNN's Michael Smerconish, insisting his brothel has \"zero tolerance\" for illicit drugs. \"Because it makes him look bad, and he wasn't doing that.\" A woman said she also saw Odom take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days. The brothel's employees said when they found him, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. 'More hopeful now' Late last week, Odom woke up and spoke for the first time , saying \"Hi\" to Kardashian, who had rushed to his bedside. Harrick said that he's been in touch with her every day. Odom spoke to her Monday, the coach said, telling her \"Good morning!\" before going back to sleep. \"We're more hopeful now\" that Odom will recover, Harrick said. \"We've been on pins and needles for days.\" Odom's maternal aunt, JaNean Mercer, also commented on Monday. She released a written statement which said, \"Lamar has always been blessed with a tenacious, fighting spirit, overcoming insurmountable obstacles to achieve the impossible. These past few days have been no different.\" He is \"defying the odds in his toughest battle to date\" with \"God's grace,\" she said. She added, \"We are committed to remaining by his side as a family for our champion, who we love immensely.\" Kardashian a 'rock' Harrick was at Kardashian and Odom's 2009 wedding.

The Los Angeles Clippers drafted him in 1999, and he played for the team for four seasons before signing with the Miami Heat. After one season in Miami, he was traded to the Lakers, and became a key part of their championship teams in 2009 and 2010.

Two years ago Odom was charged with drunk driving . He pleaded no contest and received three years' probation. Harrick believes the episode at the brothel is a \"turning point\" for Odom. The athlete has a strong support system, Harrick said, and \"prayers from everybody.\" CNN's Stella Chan, Greg Botelho, Faith Karimi , Catherine E.
