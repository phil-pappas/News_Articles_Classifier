The author of the new book \"A House of My Own: Stories From My Life\" says because of that view she decided not to relocate to northern New Mexico but she has no problem visiting. She also wants New Mexico residents to confront their views on Mexican Americans. Some Hispanic residents in New Mexico often differentiate themselves from other Latino in the U.S. by claiming they have a more direct Spanish-colonial lineage. Some scholars have disregarded those claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:44:52.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
