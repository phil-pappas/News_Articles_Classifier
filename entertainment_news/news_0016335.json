Bill Finch \nBy day, Eugene Aromi was a buttondown professor. But when he got home to his little corner lot in a dull suburb of west Mobile, he turned into one of the world's most maniacal genetic tinkerers, creating new variations of azaleas that in many ways have never been equaled. \nThe azaleas he produced were so numerous, and his work so far ahead of what everybody else was doing, that many of his finest varieties are just now becoming available, though he started work on these nearly a half century ago. \nWe featured many of these -- particularly the spectacular honeysuckle azaleas that combine great fragrance with huge clusters of white, pink, orange and red blooms -- in a column earlier in spring, when azalea grower Maarten van der Giessen allowed us a sneak peak at his collection. They were so above and beyond anything else I had seen in bloom size and color, I couldn't wait for Maarten to start producing more of these so that we all could put them in our own gardens. SOme of the Aromi hybrids show colors unlike anything ever seen before in honeysuckle azaleas. Bill Finch \nThe time has come, and the great premier party will be this year's Annual Fall Plant Sale at Mobile Botanical Gardens, next Friday and Saturday, Oct. 23 and 24, from 9 until 4 at Mobile Botanical Gardens in Municipal Park. \nThese kings of spring will be joined by a huge assortment of other plants that are drop dead gorgeous right now. You think hydrangeas just bloom in May and June? Wait until you see the Fuji Waterfall hydrangeas that produce icy blue or frosty pink flowers in huge clusters in fall. And really, the truly dwarf azaleas Coronado Red, Astronaut, Momo No Haru and other Satsuki azaleas are at their absolute best in fall, when they are blooming alongside sasanqua camellias, big fall salvias and gingers. \nAll of this explosion of color will be available at the Botanical Gardens sale, along with excellent herbs (can't wait to get my parsley, fennel, oregano and rosemary planted for winter!), vegetables like Red Russian kale, Brazilian broccoli and purple mustards that are as beautiful as ornamentals, as well as a good selection of annuals (from calendulas to snapdragons) that will bloom all winter. \nBut be warned: This may be your only chance –ever—to purchase and plant some of these Mobile-bred Aromi honeysuckle azaleas. No nursery can continue to produce so many varieties, and that means many of the most unusual, and some might argue most beautiful, cultivars will no longer be available on the market. Check them out while you can. \nFor more information about the plant sale, and for a complete list of plants, go to www.mobilebotanicalgardens.com.
