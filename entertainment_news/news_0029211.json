The rematch came on Friday night and as O’Connor stepped into the ring in front of a vocal crowd of fellow Mass-holes, the significance of that first fight was obvious. Largely because O’Connor has its date and Bracero’s name tattooed on his arm, a reminder of the defeat he was out to avenge.\nBut for O’Connor, things didn’t go quite as planned. Not even a full minute of the fight elapsed before he was out cold on the mat, his right leg bent behind him. He was the victim of what’s being called the knockout of the year. Bracero, who's not known as much of a puncher, landed a thundering right hook to O'Conner's nasty beard collapsing him like a bouncy house at the end of a birthday party.\nThis was a devastating loss for O'Connor for a host of reasons. The hometown crowd, the build-up, the failed attempt at revenge. But worst of all, it led to his image being splashed all around the internet while he's sporting that horrific dog turd on the top of his head. That's the most embarrassing part of all of this.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7scGb5yWJ94"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:58:58.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
