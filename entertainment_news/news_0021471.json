Actor Vincent Price and his wife eventually bought it and donated it to the museum in 1981. \nHonolulu Museum of Art officials will give the pole back to the Tlingit (KLINK'-it) people Thursday. \nLangdon says he learned the totem pole was used for burials, and there were remains of a man inside when Barrymore displayed it. He doesn't know what happened to the remains.
