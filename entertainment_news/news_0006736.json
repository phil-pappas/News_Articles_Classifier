Cox/Getty Images \nThe \" Uptown Funk \" singer is going farther uptown for his next project. \nMusician Bruno Mars , known for hit songs like \" Grenade \" and \" Just The Way You Are ,\" is now working on producing a family sitcom for NBC that focuses on what happens when a loud, rambunctious and argumentative family from The Bronx takes in their naive and extremely optimistic 10-year-old nephew, according to the network. \nNBC currently has a \"put pilot\" commitment for the still nameless show, which means the creators will likely make a premiere episode for it. \nHowever, the network has not put in a series order yet, so there is still not a set date regarding when it would air. \nThe new sitcom is just the latest sign of The Bronx's recent popularity with the entertainment industry. \nShows ranging from \" Gotham \" to \" The Knick \" have recently decided to film in the borough, and director Baz Luhrmann is at work making \" The Get Down ,\" a Netflix series about New York City in the 1970s that focuses mainly on a group of teenagers from The Bronx. \nThere are also two new film studios planning to open up in the borough within the next year: Silvercup Studios in Port Morris and York Studios in Soundview.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:00:48.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
