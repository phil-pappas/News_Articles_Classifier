Veteran director Robert Zemeckis is no stranger to tales of extraordinary achievers who may also be fools (Forrest Gump, Flight), nor to the innovative use of special effects (Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beowulf).\nHe’s reconstructed the towers convincingly and shot the film in 3-D, which amplifies the gulp factor when it comes to scenes set 110 storeys up.\n The movie excises any mention of Petit’s Australian warm-up, walking between the north pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (boo!), and paints him as more of an inexperienced underdog.\nAlso, the lead character’s insistence his French accomplices all speak English for “practice” seems like sheer Hollywood expedience.\nBut, after a shaky start, the film gradually becomes as taut as a high-tension wire: a complicated heist carried out in the name of wonderment.\nAnd during the dizzying, emotional climax your heart will be in your mouth — if your hands are not in front of your eyes.Opens Thursday.\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt as 24-year-old Philippe Petit.
