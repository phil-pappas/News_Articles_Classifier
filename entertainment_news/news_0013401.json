With time running out, Beaver parodies Bobby Singer in the video spoof Super[UN]natural, asking fans of the long-running Supernatural, now in it's eleventh season, to contribute and help fund his new series.\nInternity follows a misfit team of new doctors navigating intern hell, led by Dr. Nate, a fanboy who's obsessed with TV and prone to dream sequences featuring guest appearances by cast members from his favorite old reruns, movies and comic books. The not quite a drama, not quite a sitcom, genre-mashing series is described as \"Scrubs meets E.R. and they go to Comic-Con together.\"\nBeaver says, \"When I read Internity's pilot script, I was very happy with the journey my prospective character takes, but most importantly, I was pleased with the range of the story-telling, which wraps real human, emotional drama in a light-hearted package, and blends the two in much the same way real life blends them. I laughed a lot, but I was touched in my heart, too.\"\nBeaver's arrival sets Internity's major storyline into motion, adding human drama to the otherwise offbeat comedy. Beaver says, \"I like characters who draw the audience in and then reveal hidden facets no one expected. I like characters who are deeply human, even if they're deeply flawed.\"\nInternity also stars Marina Sirtis, (Star Trek: The Next Generation, NCIS, Crash) as a 50 year-old, first-year intern, and sitcom vets Richard Ruccolo (Two Guys a Girl & a Pizza Place, Rita Rocks, Legit) and Carla Jimenez, (Raising Hope, Nacho Libre, Last Man Standing). Writer/creator Joey Adams (Bones, Body of Proof, Broadway) plays Nate. Sirtis' former co-star, Lt. Worf actor Michael Dorn, (Ted 2, Castle, Heroes) will direct the pilot and make a special cameo reviving his and Sirtis' iconic Star Trek roles.\n\"I've been a fan of Jim's for years, \" Adams said. \"I wrote this role for him, so when he said yes, I was ecstatic. The video is my protest to the Supernatural team for killing off Bobby. I want Jim on Internity, absolutely, but like legions of fans, I want Bobby back!\"\nOf his vocal fan base, Beaver says, \"No one's tied me up and held me hostage yet. I'm treated very well by the fans, in general, and as long as it's between consenting adults... even the tying up might not be a deal-breaker.\"\nCampaign: http://igg.me/at/internityTV\nJim Beaver Promo Video: http://bit.ly/1KQspQ2\nTwitter: @internityTVshow\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/internityTV\nWeb: www.internityTV.com\n release/paging-bobby-singer-413907.php", "external_links": ["http://igg.me/at/internityTV", "http://bit.ly/1KQspQ2", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/paging-bobby-singer-413907.php", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.facebook.com/internityTV"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:32:49.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
