Tickle each Moji's hair to hear its silly sounds – no two Mojis sound alike!\nMojis have their own silly language and love to chat with you – and each other – all day long. Just tickle their hair to get the conversation going, or cross the hairs of two Mojis together and they will talk to each other. Just like you, Mojis express their feelings through unique sounds, all of which they communicate in their own fun way. Sounds include happy, frazzled, grumpy, silly, startled and more. When Moji Mis are bored they fall asleep and start to snore, but pick them up and they'll wake and start chatting again.\nMoji fans are invited to meet a new Moji every Monday, now through Christmas. Little Kids Inc. will release a stop animation video across all of their Moji Mi social media platforms each week, and each video will introduce a different Moji and describe their Moji mood!\nFans can share their own Moji Moods, using videos, pictures and more during the Moji Mood Monday holiday campaign using #mojimood.\nToday's #mojimood video features the new Feelin' Double Dog Daring Moji Mi; this moji is smooth, he's suave, he's definitely cocky - and he may or may not be Norweigian. He's guarenteed to be the coolest Moji in the room – let's face it, you'll want to be him.\nThere's a Moji for every emotion – so tell us, What's your Moji Mood ?!\nFollow Moji Mi on Instagram (my_moji_mi), Facebook (Moji-Mi), and Twitter (my_moji_mi).\nMoji Mis recently appeared in The Toy Insiders Top 2015 Holiday Toy Guide ( http://www.thetoyinsider.com/toys/moji-mi/ ) and are designed for kids 6 & up.
