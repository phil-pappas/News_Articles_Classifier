( http://www.vectorworks.net/company ) has solidified its place at the forefront of the entertainment design industry with the acquisition of the ESP Vision product line, including the well-known Vision Pro, the most advanced lighting pre-visualization software available for both PC and Mac operating systems.\nFor the last 10 years, lighting, film, TV, exhibit, concert, theatre and other designers have been exporting their light plots, scenic designs and event models created with Vectorworks Spotlight ( http://www.vectorworks.net/spotlight/ ) software to ESP Vision to cue and visualize award-winning experiences. This announcement creates a path to further enable such workflow collaboration.\n\"This purchase fortifies Vectorworks' global market leadership position and signals our continuous commitment to the entertainment design industry at a time when visualization capabilities are becoming a more mission-critical, cost-effective means of cueing a show in advance,\" said Stewart Rom, Vectorworks' chief marketing officer. \"Bringing Vision into the Vectorworks product portfolio places the integration of its pre-visualization capabilities on the Spotlight software roadmap.\"\nRom noted that Vectorworks will continue to support ESP Vision's existing customers. In addition, Vision's technical team will join Vectorworks' development and support group to further develop integrated tools that serve professionals involved in the design and production of live events and exhibitions.\n\"It's an exciting time for Vision and Vectorworks Spotlight software users, as the industry standard in lighting design documentation now also owns the highest-quality pre-visualization software in the industry,\" said Alan “AJ” Jesse, director of support at ESP Vision. \"Our companies have thrived when working together over the past few years, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for these two products.\"\nFrom October 23 through October 25 in Las Vegas, Vectorworks and ESP Vision staff will showcase their product capabilities at the 2015 Live Design International (LDI) conference ( http://www.ldishow.com/ldi15/Public/enter.aspx ), the leading tradeshow and conference for live design professionals from around the globe.
