R andom Access Memories, Daft Punk!'\" she tells Grammy Pro. \"And they really dragged out the 'reeee.' And for a second there, I kind of thought we had it, and we didn't.\" \nTaylor admits the loss hit her hard and she briefly let her emotions get the better of her as she drowned her sorrows eating junk food. \n\"I remember not going to afterparties,\" she recalls. \"I went home and I cried a little bit, and I got In-N-Out Burger and ate a lot.\" \nIt wasn't the only award Taylor missed out on at the 2014 Grammys - she went home empty-handed after also losing out on Best Country Album, Best Country Song for \"Begin Again,\" and Best Country Duo/Group Performance for \"Highway Don't Care,\" her collaboration with Tim McGraw and Keith Urban. \nTaylor had previously claimed the Album of the Year Grammy for her 2008 release \"Fearless.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:05:13.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
