But even the most advanced virtual reality system can't compare to the real chills and thrills of a haunted attraction.\nAmerica Haunts is an association of more than 30 elite haunted attractions with locations in 20 distinct markets across the United States . Members of the association spend all year coming up with state-of-the art; creative displays and shows that feel like you're on the set of a film or inside a video game.\n\"You have a realistic set you are moving through as horrific characters, top-notch special effects and creepy lighting all conspire to terrify you,\" said Randy Bates , America Haunts spokesman. \"It goes beyond virtual reality to actual reality, as you reach out and touch the wall, feel drops in temperature and smell ghastly odors. You feel like you've been transported.\"\nNo screen can replace the physical thrill of tilting floors, flashing lights, moving walls, and creeping scents that a trip through a good haunt offers. Otherworldly, yet still real, haunts allow youth to experience a good scare in an environment that they know is actually safe – and nothing beats the rush when they emerge into the real world unscathed ! That is an experience video games just can't match no matter how well-crafted they are.\nBates continued, \"Our members overlook no detail in making their visitors' experience as realistic as possible, it's like stepping into the game itself versus looking at it and playing it on a screen.\"\nHaunted houses let kids spend time with family or friends interacting, moving around and putting themselves into the experience instead of passively responding to pixels on a screen. While the show – and the scare – is what brings visitors through the door, the real fun of visiting a haunted attraction is in reacting to scares with other people. That creates greater connections with them in a way video games just can't do.\nGames might offer an incredible, futuristic version of reality – but a haunted attraction puts you right there in the action in a way nothing else can.\nWith nearly 30 haunted houses and attractions across the country, America Haunts delivers fear-based entertainment to more than a million thrill seekers each season. America Haunts has been featured on the Travel Channel and its members recognized by The Guinness Book of World Records on multiple occasions. The organization is committed to providing technical excellence, stunning set design, Hollywood -quality make-up, costumes and actors. Members enjoy nothing more than delivering, a good old-fashioned scare.
