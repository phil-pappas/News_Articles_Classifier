Photo: Ben King \nThe sleepy seaside town of Barwon Heads was rocked by explosions this week. The bridge across the Barwon River – made famous by SeaChange in the late '90s, condemned in 2006, and rebuilt in 2010 – was hit by a gang of teenagers early on Tuesday. \nVandals? No. Resistance fighters, pushing back against an invading army. It was Tomorrow When the War Began . Again. \nThe first book in John Marsden's series of seven young adult novels, published in 1993, was turned into a film in 2010. It was a serious effort, a $20 million action adventure directed by Pirates of the Caribbean writer Stuart Beattie, with former Neighbours star Caitlin​ Stasey​ as central character and narrator Ellie, and a talented young cast that included Lincoln Lewis (son of former rugby league great Wally Lewis) and Puberty Blues star Ashleigh Cummings. \nNew take: A drone camera used to capture some of the action in the series.

In a series, you can open it up, deal with all the issues John's books talk about in lots more detail. There's a lot of really good fodder there.\" \nThis version is a six-part series for the children's channel ABC3. Ultimately, Boughen hopes to make three or four series, though that obviously will depend on how well this one goes. \nHe hopes he's making something that will appeal to parents as well as kids – what the networks refer to as a \"co-viewing\" proposition. \"There's 20 years of history there,\" he says. \"People who were reading them as teenagers can now hopefully revisit them with their own kids.\" \nThat's the great thing about kids' fiction: every year, there's a new audience for it. \"There's an extremely long tail with kids' television,\" Boughen says, \"whereas a movie goes out, makes a splash and disappears\". \nStill, the trick to maximising that long tail is to make sure you don't load your show with of-the-moment references that will look dreadfully dated two in three years' time. \nSo, there will be no nods to Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran. But there will be technology (perhaps the thing most prone to dating of all). \n\"We've set in today's environment and time,\" Boughen says. \"The communications process has changed since John wrote the novels – the internet, phones, the way kids communicate with each other.\" \nThe invaders cut off the communications network and install their own closed satellite system. \n\"So our characters will know the frustration of not being able to connect. No Facebook, Snapchat​, Twitter – they have to rediscover traditional modes of communication. They can't look up on the internet how to do X, Y, Z; they have to work out how to do things by themselves.\" \nTo your average teenager, that probably sounds a lot more terrifying than any explosion ever could.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:28:42.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
