And Ivanka who huddled with him during breaks in the TV debates. \n\"She's got great sensibility\"— that's how Trump describes his daughter. \nThe campaign isn't saying exactly what she's doing. \nBut she's said to help with campaign messaging and to have contributed to her father's tax plan — while acting more broadly as his muse. \nAll this, while Ivanka Trump sells her own line of jewelry, clothing, shoes, and more. And serves as a power player in the Trump real estate empire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:32:58.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
