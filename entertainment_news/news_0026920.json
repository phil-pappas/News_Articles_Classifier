Yet, Kannada cinema's female action star Malashree says that Ganga, for which she collaborated with director Sai Prakash after 20 years, will be a film that she will cherish forever.\n\"There are certain elements that people have come to expect from my films, be it massy punch lines or heavy-duty action. Ganga will have all of that, but not to the extent of my other movies. This film has a beautiful story and is performance-oriented. For the first time in my career, I play an auto rickshaw driver and the story deals with issues that most women can relate to, like, for instance, sharing the responsibility of a household, being bold and leading a life without depending on others for help, among others,\" says Malashree.\nIn playing this character, the actress had to tone down her body language. \"I've played a lot of rough and tough characters, for which I developed a certain style of carrying myself around, my gait, etc. In this film, I am often seen sari-clad, so there was no way I could behave the same way,\" she says. The most difficult part, though, was getting the emotions right. \"As an entertainer, it is easy to get someone to laugh, but to make the audience feel the pain of your character and get teary-eyed when you are crying is a totally different ball game and not easy at all,\" adds Malashree.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/journey/ganga"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:05:53.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
