His award-winning son - playwright, poet and novelist Barney Norris, 28, winner of the Critics’ Circle and Off West End Most Promising Playwright Awards, 2014, will be reciting his poems with musical accompaniment. \nDavid told the Daily Echo:\"The idea is that the organ represents the landscape and the forces of nature, while the saxophones represent humanity, acting out successive human interventions across the centuries, and Barney's poems slot in there.\" \nThe music blends melodic counterpoint with jazz chords and rhythms to create a unique language of its own, and the line-up of world-class performers - John Harle, Rob Buckland, Paul Stevens, Andy Findon (saxophones) and Sarah Baldock ( organ) should guarantee an electrifying experience. Promoted stories \nIt is David Owen Norris’s second new piece this autumn. The first, Turning Points, a cantata for chorus, children’s choir, vocal soloists, orchestra, brass band, electric guitars, piano duet and organ, commissioned by the Agincourt Commemoration Committee, was experienced live by well over a thousand people in its first couple of weeks. \nOne French reviewer wrote: ‘I can only sketch a skeleton of this astounding piece. It deserves a whole book to itself.’ \nSir Geoffrey Hill, Oxford Professor of Poetry, wrote: ‘Your music is powerfully and beautifully your own.’ \nBarney Norris’s new play Eventide is currently on tour. ‘A play that captures all the still, sad, music of humanity.’ Michael Billington in The Guardian. \n‘A writer-chronicler to be cherished.’ Evening Standard \nticketsource.co.uk/davidowennorris \nticketsource.co.uk/musicinromsey Share article \n*Barney Norris will bring his new play 'Eventide' to Salisbury Playhouse next month ( November 3-7) which both celebrates and mourns changing rural communities in Hampshire. \nIt comes on a short UK tour direct from glowing critical acclaim in London and is a co-production between Barney's theatre company Up In Arms and Arcola Theatre.
