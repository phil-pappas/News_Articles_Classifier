They were fathers, mothers, artists and activists. They enjoyed cigars, reading and one person was a fan of KFC. Erecting one-of-a-kind altars to honor loves ones for Dia de los Muertos — Day of the Dead — has been a Mexican tradition that dates to the Mayan and Aztec civilizations. It also is celebrated throughout Latin America, and families have brought the tradition to the U.S. But although the holiday traces back to indigenous times, the Dia de los Muertos celebrated today is heavily influenced by the introduction of Catholicism by Spanish conquistadors. Dia de los Muertos is intended to celebrate loved ones who have died. Family members decorate colorful altars with picture frames, candles, perforated paper, marigolds and offerings, or ofrendas. The ofrendas, which include water, sweet bread called pan de muerto and other foods, are intended for a deceased person’s spirit, which is believed to visit its family when the gates of heaven open Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. Since the 1990s, the Mexican Heritage Center has been inviting community members to use its space to honor their loved ones by building altars, Mexican Heritage Center President Gracie Madrid said. It gives the community an opportunity to learn about Mexican culture and tradition and for the Heritage Center to promote and educate. Each of the 15 altars built, which will be on display until Nov. 13, has its own story to tell, she said. This year, the Mexican Heritage Center also is hosting a street fiesta from 2-6 p.m. Nov. 1 on Market Street, between South Sutter and South San Joaquin streets. The event will include a kid zone with pony rides, cotton candy and other activities. There also will be folkloric dancing and a Catrina dress-up contest for all ages. The Catrina is a fancy female skeleton. At The Haggin Museum, the 20th Annual Community Ofrenda will be created by artist Paco Garcia, 33, and on display from Wednesday until Nov. 1. Garcia, who recently moved to Tracy from Oakland, will create a painting and, with the help of his wife, build a flower-strewn altar. He said as a Mexican man the tradition has been around him his entire life and he’s eager to share and inform the community of the holiday. With the holiday’s growing popularity there is misinformation. Day of the Dead is not about worshiping death or meant to scare people — like a Party City commercial implies, he said. The Catrina is not just a Halloween costume and there’s more to the tradition than sugar skulls. Garcia said as a Mexican artist it is his responsibility to share the beauty and history of the tradition with the community, and he’s excited that the Haggin Museum gave him an opportunity. On Wednesday, Garcia will be at the Haggin Museum from 1-2:30 p.m. for hands-on activities and at 2:30 p.m. the museum will host Flor y Canto, or Flower and Song, with local author and poet Richard Rios. — Contact reporter Almendra Carpizo at (209) 546-8264 or acarpizo@recordnet.com.
