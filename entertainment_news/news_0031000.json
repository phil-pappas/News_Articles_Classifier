No one understands this more than Merawyn Harrison, who suspended her aspirations of an art career so her husband could obtain a law degree. Harrison’s subsequent divorce prompted her to write “Poems of a Divorcee” which stemmed from her despair at the break-up of her family.\nHer book is comprised of several personal poems and haikus, covering a myriad of topics ranging from grief, nature, and art to feminism. She also details her struggle as a single parent raising two sons.\n“In my book I express grief and shock at the cruelty and shallowness that men can express, and for two small children whom I had high hopes for a happy and fulfilled life,” Harrison said.\nHarrison said she was hesitant at first to publish her work, but realized she did not wish to keep her personal thoughts hidden from her sons.\n“I just felt that my poetry attempts might come together as a sort of swan song, and that my boys might be interested to learn about another side of me other than mother,” Harrison said.\nHer poems tug at the heartstrings of readers, especially those who are recoiling after a recent divorce. She hopes that her book will bring joy and solace to women and others who have undergone similar trying life experiences.\nFor more information, visit http://www.amazon.com/Poems-Divorcee-Merawyn-Harrison/dp/1503511995 .\nBook “Poems of a Divorcee”\nBy Merawyn Harrison\nISBN: 978-1-5035-1199-6\nAvailable in softcover, hardcover,\nAvailable on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Xlibris\nMerawyn Harrison lives in Adelaide, Australia.\n# # #\n**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**\nFor review copies or interview requests, contact:\nCraig Cainkar\n317.275.2067\nccainkar(at)bohlsengroup.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1BvZW1zLURpdm9yY2VlLU1lcmF3eW4tSGFycmlzb24vZHAvMTUwMzUxMTk5NQ==", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1503511995"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:05:20.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
