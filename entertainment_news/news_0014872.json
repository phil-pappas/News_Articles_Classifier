Talking about his character, he says, \"I play the role of an assistant director â€” someone who has a lot of modern ideas in filmmaking. According to the story, I work under Karunakaran, who plays the role of a director in this film.\"\nHe also has Bhooloham in his kitty in which he plays a college student, who locks horns with Jeyam Ravi. However, Narayan has one regret. \"I had met director K Balachander on my last birthday and he said that he had a script and he wanted me to play a negative role in it. I wish that had happened and I really miss him now. I got his blessings and I think that is more than enough.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:27:49.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
