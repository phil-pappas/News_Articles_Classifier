She can talk to my kids about their thing, or she'll talk to me about my book or my business.\" \nWhile Cindy has earned her reputation as a fashion icon thanks to her 30 year modelling career, Amal has managed to achieve a similar status in just a short few months thanks to her stylish appearance, but Cindy insists she and her new pal usually have more important things to discuss than the world of fashion. \n\"Amal is an incredibly fashionable person, so she doesn't need my advice,\" Cindy said. \"I guess we talk about fashion in a way, but it's not like we pore over magazines together. It's more like, she'll ask me, 'Who is your favorite photographer'. She's interested in my life, just like I'm interested in her life.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:16:05.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
