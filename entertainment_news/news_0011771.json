And this isn’t about tokenism. \n\"Alex Lamb and his story team have worked with Riley to create an ‘EastEnders’ character who is fresh and relatable – but also comes with his own stock of secrets and is going to be thrown right into one of our biggest stories for the end of the year. \n“I hope that the audience will take Riley and his character to their hearts as quickly as everyone here at ‘EastEnders’ has done.” \nRiley adds: “I am extremely excited to be joining EastEnders. I can honestly say that I have now fulfilled my two biggest dreams – to be living my life as a man and to be an actor. I cannot wait to really get stuck in with filming and I look forward to seeing what is in store for my character.” \nIn recent months, ‘EastEnders’ has tackled a number of real life issues, and they’ve worked with charities to ensure storylines such as Shabnam and Kush’s stillbirth tragedy , and Lee’s depression have been handled sensitively and appropriately. Close 'EastEnders' Storylines You've Probably Forgotten of   With the help of Sean, Tanya came up with a plan to get rid of her cheating husband for good. Well... Until she had a change of heart and dug him back up. Well, there's not much to say about this is there? that gravelly voice never gets boring, does it? Is there anyway Beppe can come back? Letitia Dean and Paul Medford's characters entered a battle of the bands competition back in 1986, and the song was released by the BBC in real life, landing them at number 12 in the charts. Phil's serious drug use storyline was somewhat undermined by the fact his addiction lasted for approximately 10 days... We all remember 'Who shot Phil?', but what about when Jane was fired at by her step-son? This emotional storyline tackled a number of key issues, bringing mental health issues into the spotlight. Remember him?! Remember Ashley Cotton? The youngster brought some light into grandma Dot's life - until Nick intervened and ruined things... After agreeing to give her baby to Jane, Lucy decided to have a secret termination, agreeing with Ian that they would tell Jane it was a miscarriage. Why are Jane and Ian getting married again? Bianca and Carol may have patched up their differences in recent years, but things were very different in 1999, when they both stared relationships with the same man. Those were the days... (SPOILER: It obviously did not work out well for them...) As weird romances go, this was certainly one of the best... There's a reason the role of Ben Mitchell has been recast so many times, and this serious storyline was transformed into a rather ridiculous one, thanks to the not-so-great acting from this young star.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:10:41.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
