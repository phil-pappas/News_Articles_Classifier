Water Tower Gets Super Hero Makeover Reported by Outsiders - 2015.10.20 For the first time ever, the iconic Warner Bros. water tower is receiving a Super Hero makeover, with the unveiling of giant renderings of Arrow, The Flash, Gotham's Detective Gordon and Supergirl on the iconic structure which rises 100 feet high above the Warner Bros. Studios lot. A super team featuring dozens of Studio artisans, engineers and artists collaborated on this first-of-its-kind installation celebrating four Warner Bros. Television series based on characters from DC Comics. ABOUT THE DCTV SUPER HERO TAKEOVER · The characters from Arrow, The Flash, Gotham and Supergirl are displayed on giant aluminum panels measuring 22 feet by 20 feet in size, with each one weighing more than 5,000 pounds. · Dozens of craftspeople were involved in the design and production of the panels, with representatives from a number of Studio departments including scenic design, special effects, lighting, signs and graphics, the metal shop, electrical, rigging and engineering. · The panels will be on display for 90 days and were unveiled in a ceremony on Monday night, October 19. · They were installed using a specially devised custom-pulley system during the October 17-18 weekend. The cables for the reveal of the panels were held down by 8,000 pounds of cement. · Attendees at the unveiling included Supergirl star Melissa Benoist, Gotham stars Erin Richards and Cory Michael Smith, and executive producers Greg Berlanti & Andrew Kreisberg (Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl), Ali Adler (Supergirl), Marc Guggenheim (Arrow), and Bruno Heller, Danny Cannon & John Stephens (Gotham).

ABOUT THE WATER TOWER · The Warner Bros. water tower was built in 1927 and has since been declared an historical landmark. · Standing 100 feet tall, the water tower contains a 100,000-gallon tank - although it currently holds no water. · Previously located next to the Warner Bros. Fire Department, it was moved following the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, when the Warners realized that if the tower had fallen and damaged the Fire Department, the Fire Department would not have been able to provide emergency assistance. · The water tower was once home to the animated stars of Animaniacs (Yakko, Wacko and Dot) from the 1930s until they escaped in the 1990s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:03:10.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
