I love Avellino! My wife's family was from Avellino!\" \n\"Actually,\" I reply, \"my name is Ervolino!\" \n\"Ervolino?\" he yells back. \"That's a terrible name! Change it!\" \nWhen Brooks raises his voice, he sounds almost exactly like The Honorable William J. Lepetomane, the overwrought, cross-eyed, cleavage-obsessed governor he played in \"Blazing Saddles,\" which is wholly appropriate, since that movie is what he has called to talk about. Tonight, after a showing of the comedy classic at NJPAC, Brooks will stride onstage, talk, joke and answer questions from the audience. \nIt has been 41 years since Brooks' manic western burst onto — and off of — the screen. (Spoiler alert: At the end of the movie, two of its characters go to a theater to see the end of the movie they're in, and ... oh, never mind. It's complicated.) And it took a little arm-twisting to get him to bring the movie back again — with him as part of the package. \n\"You know, the people who put this together are always asking me to do these things,\" Brooks says. \"I told them, 'No. I'm too old. I don't want to do this stuff anymore. I have enough money coming in!\" (Touring companies of his two films-turned-stage-musicals, \"Young Frankenstein\" and \"The Producers,\" are doing well. And he's working on a new production of the former on London's West End.) \n\"So, finally, they said, 'Mel, which film is your favorite?' I always say, 'I can't ... I can't ... they're like children.' But, on the big screen, I've always preferred 'Blazing Saddles.' It's just so ... well ... have you ever seen 'Blazing Saddles' on a big screen?\" \nI tell him I saw it on the night it opened in 1974. \n\"Good!\" he bellows. \"Time to see it again!\" \nAsked how many times he has seen the movie, Brooks becomes deadly serious. But only for a few seconds. Then he starts yelling again. \n\"Would you believe I've seen it about 2,000 times,\" he begins. \"Literally. I'm not kidding. But it's a funny movie. It's the funniest movie ever made! I keep telling that to what's-his-name, Bob Gazzale over at AFI.\" \n(He's referring to the American Film Institute and its president and CEO.) \n\"You know AFI,\" he continues. \"They have all these lists ... 100-this, 100-that. For best comedies, they have us in the Top 10. They have 'Some Like It Hot' at number one, and we're number three, or something like that.\" \n(Actually, \"Blazing Saddles\" is No. 6 on AFI's list of \"100 Years … 100 Laughs\") followed by \"The Producers\" in 11th place and \"Young Frankenstein\" in 13th.) \n\"So, anyway, this Gazzale,\" Brooks says, without taking a breath, \"I've challenged him to a fight outside the Chinese Theater. Let's get this over with! I mean, I have nothing against 'Some Like It Hot.' It's a good movie. Everybody likes it. I like it. They could put it at two or three. That I wouldn't mind.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:48:36.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
