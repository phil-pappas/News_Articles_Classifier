The story's also set in New York City in the early 2000s, so I think listeners will also appreciate the memories of those turbulent times,\" Quinn said. \nQuinn has worked in broadcasting for more than 30 years, and was a television anchor at the Fox News Channel, MSNBC and NBC. She holds an MFA in writing from Sarah Lawrence College and a BS from Cornell University. \n\"Writing a novel was certainly a challenge for someone who's used to slamming out copy and avoiding adjectives, to write the sort of long-form, descriptive narrative necessary for novel writing,\" said Quinn, who lives in Connecticut with her husband and three children. \"But it was also fun. And working in noisy newsrooms for so many years definitely helped me tune out the chaos at home.\" \nThe book sells for $13.99.
