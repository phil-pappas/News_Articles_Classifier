The next mediation session was scheduled for Thursday.\nThe school board's proposal stressed a commitment to \"living within our financial means,\" citing economic concerns including uncertain state funding, caps on property tax increases and fears the state could shift teacher pension obligations to school districts.\nWhile the current salary schedule provides roughly 4 percent annual salary increases for certified teachers, according to the school board's proposal, the board wants to move away from guaranteed annual percentages. Instead, the Gurnee-based district wants to tie raises to the inflation rate, with annual salary increases between 2 and 3 percent for support staff and teachers earning less than $78,000 per year, and capped at 2 percent for teachers earning more.\nDistrict 50 teachers, school board prepare to publish latest contract offer Lauren Zumbach After nine months of negotiations without agreement on a new contract, Woodland Community Consolidated School District 50's school board and the teachers union are preparing to post their contract proposals for public viewing within the next two weeks, district officials said in a statement Wednesday.\n... After nine months of negotiations without agreement on a new contract, Woodland Community Consolidated School District 50's school board and the teachers union are preparing to post their contract proposals for public viewing within the next two weeks, district officials said in a statement Wednesday.\n... (Lauren Zumbach) Earlier this month, the school board released a statement saying a union proposal called for a 9.9 percent annual pay increase for teachers and 7 percent annual increases for support staff.\nWoodland Council President Sharon Anday, an eighth-grade teacher, said in a statement last week those numbers were \"inflated,\" with the largest raise requested — 5 percent — coming in the contract's first year.\n\"We feel the changes the Board has proposed will force many of our teachers and staff to look for work elsewhere in the coming years, taking their experience with them,\" she said at the time.\nThe school board also proposed changes to employees' health benefits beginning in the 2016-17 school year, including 5- to 17.5-percent reductions in the share of insurance premiums the district covers, depending on the plan. The school board also wants to swap a low-deductible healthcare plan it says would subject the district $400,000 in tax penalties beginning in 2018 with a cheaper plan.\nUnion officials countered in their proposal that while they're \"sensitive\" to district finances, they already agreed to a 2011 pay freeze and the creation of additional insurance plans in 2012 that moved some members to plans that were cheaper for the district but had higher out-of-pocket costs.\nThe union is asking the district to leave current insurance benefits unchanged while agreeing to pick up 77.5 percent of family dental benefit premiums. Currently, the district pays all dental premiums for single employees and no family dental benefits.\nAlso at issue are non-financial policies, including the board's push for the authority to set arrival and dismissal times for staff and students and require frequent online grading updates and more parent teacher conference time.\nIn its proposal, union officials said they support requiring online grades once the district can support the system and provides training for teachers, but not requiring midterm grades or progress reports. Teachers and support staff are also seeking limits on class sizes, protections for planning and curriculum development time and \"streamlining\" teacher evaluations, according to a statement from the union.\nThe Woodland Council represents about 780 teachers and support staff in District 50. Union employees last went on strike in 2003, said district spokeswoman Jennifer Tempest Bova.\n\"The Board and the Union will continue to negotiate in good faith under the guidance of the federal mediator, with the goal to reach an agreement on a new contract which recognizes the excellent work performed by our staff, protects the district's fiscal viability over the length of the agreement and supports student learning and achievement,\" Board President Chris Schrantz said in a statement Wednesday.\nlzumbach@tribpub.com\nTwitter @laurenzumbach\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Educators Unions", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560de178/turbine/ct-lns-woodland-teacher-union-negotiations-st-1002-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9a71/turbine/ct-lns-woodland-district-contract-proposals-st-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:31:37.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
