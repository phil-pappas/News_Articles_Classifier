It would be a dream come true for this Yorkshire lass! I’ve been trying to get there for so long, I’ll give it my absolute all. Why do you think you are different from everyone else in your category? I’m a stunt woman, you can get me jumping off speakers or doing crazy stuff. I’m fearless like that. It’s what I do everyday, I’m just a bit nuts and like to entertain people. \nJennifer Phillips \nAge: 49 years old, from London Occupation: Session singer In her first audition: She performed Mary Mary’s Shackles What would it mean to you to get to the lives? It’s emotional for me because I’m so tired, I never knew the body had so much nerves. I’m a nervous wreck because one minute you’re laughing, one minute you’re sad. You can’t sleep, it’s so intense because it means so much. I can’t believe I am here and now that I have reached Judges’ Houses my mindset has changed. I really want this, I have to do it now because I have come so far. How would you describe Simon in three words? Gorgeous, powerful and charming. \nKerrie-Anne Phillips \nAge: 28 years old, from London Occupation: Works as a singer/teacher In her first audition: She performed Rihanna’s We Found Love How would you describe your style? I think it’s chic, modern and I like to mix it up so I’ll go for what I call rock couture, the rock chick vibe mixed with some couture pieces. What would it mean to get to the live shows? It would mean so much to me because I’ve given up a lot to get through this competition. I don’t want to stop here. \nMax Stone", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:32:50.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
