After an appointment, reader Sally Deckard and husband, Matt, needed some lunch. “He Yelped it,” she says. \nSally’s Take \nSally says Matt said the online reviews all came back great, and his phone knew the couple’s proximity to the deli. The couple found a new, technology-assisted favorite that day. Sally loves Mediterranean flavors, and now even more so. She’s nine months pregnant, and “anything that tastes like olives or pickles I’m game for,” she jokes. \nSally loves a good gyro ($6.99) and says Vasken’s is the best because of the large amount of tzatziki sauce they use. Today, we decide to also start with a tzatziki appetizer and pita bread ($5.49). “Oh, that’s good,” she says after one bite of our huge appetizer. “I like that it’s nice and thick like an actual dip.” She notes the dip has a strong dill flavor. “You would definitely have to like dill to enjoy this appetizer.” We have so much dip left over that we have more than enough to take home. \nOn to the main event: the gyro. “They gave me a generous amount of tzatziki, which I, of course, love,” she says. The creamy dip balances the kick of the red onion. “The meat is warm, but not overly hot, and it really balances out the tomato and lettuce,” she says. “I’m already full and need to stop for baklava!” \nWe each get a piece of baklava ($1.99 per piece), and Sally notes that it’s a bit sweet for her tastes, and she prefers more nuts and spices. “It’s really sweet,” she says. Though she prefers a more savory baklava, she does note that it’s just the right amount of flaky. \nKatie’s Take \nI first had Vasken’s Deli at its Branson location when I visited the city for a morning meeting. The cafe has the feel of a chain, so I was surprised when I learned that the Springfield and Branson locations were the only ones around. Nice and polished doesn’t always have to mean chain. It can mean local, too, as Vasken’s shows us. Since my first visit to Vasken’s, I’ve eaten at the Springfield location, too, as I love Mediterranean flavors. \nOn a previous visit, I tried the chicken shawarma, which is a pita with seasoned chicken, sauce and pickles. I often opt for the pita without the pickles, unlike Sally. Today, though, I decide I want to try something different. Sally’s gyro looks amazing, but I decide to go the pita pizza route and get the gyro pizza, which has everything I’d expect on a gyro, but just baked onto a flat pita ($6.99). \nFirst, though, that tzatziki sauce. I notice Vasken’s has a deli case with some of its sauces to go, and that’s an insanely smart idea, as this tzatziki sauce has to be the best I’ve ever had. We get a ton of it, and I’m digging the way the fresh dill flavors complement the creamy base. \nI like this dip so much that I find myself dipping every bite of the gyro pizza into the dip. Not that my pizza needs any extra flavor. Anyone who loves gyro meat as Sally and I do needs to get on with ordering this pizza. It’s what I would expect from an open-faced gyro, but with ample cheese. And the tzatziki dip gives it that perfect creaminess that complements the savory lamb. \nUnlike Sally, I’m not too picky about my baklava. I just know that it’s sweet, flaky and delicious. I also enjoy that I can purchase a small piece so that it ends up being just the right amount of dessert after a filling pita pizza. \nThe Dish, the Restaurant \nStaci and Vasken Haroutounian opened the Branson Vasken’s in 1998. Though the couple started in Kimberling City, they’ve landed in Branson. Vasken is Armenian, but born in Beirut, Lebanon, and he learned cooking in his family’s restaurant in Little Rock. The couple decided Missouri, and Branson in particular, would be a great fit for their family of five. \n“Vasken just makes really good food,” Staci says. The two started with an international market, but that turned into the deli as people started responding to Vasken’s style of cooking and the Mediterranean flavors. “We had hummus, baba ganoush and tabouli before they were ever popular,” Staci says. To keep local palates happy, they brought in traditional soups, sandwiches and salads as well. “He’s got a knack for the food he does,” Staci says of Vasken. \nThe tzatziki sauce Sally and I went crazy over comes from Vasken’s mom’s recipe. It’s the exact same sauce the duo puts on its gyros. “It’s sour cream, mint, garlic and some secret ingredients,” Staci says. “We make everything from scratch.” Many tzatziki sauces are made with yogurt, but Vasken found that using sour cream gives it a creamier, better-to-dip-in consistency. \nThe pita pizzas haven’t always been on the menu. Staci and Vasken made pita pizzas for friends when the restaurant was closed once, and the friends just raved. “They said, ‘you have to put these on the menu!’” Staci says. So they did. They’re picky about their pita and use a supplier from Canada who meets the specifications they like. Plus, having pizzas, and many of the traditional soups and sandwiches, keeps picky Ozarkers not ready to take the jump into Armenian food happy. Sally and I agree that there’s definitely enough on the menu to keep us coming back again and again. Especially for that amazing tzatziki sauce. \nVasken and Staci want to encourage folks to check out the Branson location, as the Springfield location had to temporarily close due to unforeseen circumstances. It should reopen in the next one to two weeks. Please visit the Branson Vasken’s Facebook page for updates on when those great flavors will be back on East Battlefield Road. \nOur Guest: Sally Deckard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:59:16.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
