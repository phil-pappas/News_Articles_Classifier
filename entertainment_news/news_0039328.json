(Photo by Jim Dyson/Getty Images)\nIn his new memoir, \"Fortune Son,\" music legend John Fogerty details the highest and lowest points of his career, from fulfilling his \"musical dream\" to the \"long, dark period\" in his life as the frontman of Creedence Clearwater Revival, reports CBS News correspondent John Blackstone.\nThe hit song \"Proud Mary\" transformed Fogerty and his bandmates from struggling musicians to superstars almost overnight.\n\"I just absolutely knew that it was a great song. And usually I'm a kind of modest person and I would probably be wanting to say, 'Well, it was kinda good,' you know? 'It was okay.' No--at the moment, it was great.\"\nAnd it wasn't just a one-hit wonder. Fogerty quickly followed up with a remarkable string of hits that would become music classics--like \"Bad Moon Rising,\" \"Down on the Corner,\" and \"Fortunate Son\"--and resonate across generations. The band produced three hit albums in 1969 alone.\n39 Photos Woodstock's artists 45 years later The Woodstock Music and Art Fair featured some of the biggest performers of the 1960s. Where are they now?\nBut the band's prolific career was cut short, and it became infamous for having one of the most acrimonious breakups in music history.\nCreedence disintegrated almost as fast as its rise to success. Lead vocalist Tom Fogerty left to pursue a solo career out from under his younger brother John's shadow, while bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford demanded more creative control.\n\"They now wanted to write songs and sing the songs they wrote and arrange the songs,\" Fogerty recalled. \"Either it was going to be this way or we were going to fall apart right here. So I agreed.\"\nCook and Clifford went on to say Fogerty sabotaged the album, forcing them to write. When \"Mardi Gras\" was released, a Rolling Stone reviewed called it \"the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band.\" Creedence never made another record.\nIn addition to a string of lawsuits with his bandmates, Fogarty also spent decades battling the record company that signed him as a teenager and claimed ownership of his iconic songs.\n\"The fact that I don't own these, you know, wonderful songs certainly has gnawed at me,\" he said. \"The whole world knows those are your songs.\"\nToday, Fogerty says he is at a much happier time and at age 70, still hasn't lost a beat. At his home in Los Angeles, Fogerty and his sons Shane and Tyler have built their own recording studio for family jam sessions.\n\"Shane is a wonderful guitar player. And those are amazing moments in life when you get to share that closeness,\" Fogerty said. \"After all, it's in his DNA.\"", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/11/13/222d23a9-a645-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/770x430/102003d1e64d778cb2d6bd437451d928/148343458.jpg", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/13/4818f7da-4ae5-4bb8-bdb2-7bf94e5a92ad/thumbnail/220x140/3b5bc7a64bd6b3e00a3d7a4b7902fa51/image5234804.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:05:57.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
