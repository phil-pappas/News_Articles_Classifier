The conventional notion that the horror genre ought to be suspenseful is eschewed in favor of gratuitous bloodlettings accompanied by pop songs. \nThe plot, such as it exists, concerns a hotel in Los Angeles where, roach-motel style, visitors check in but do not check out. Instead, they are slaughtered by the various permanent denizens: Kathy Bates and Sarah Paulson, of course, augmented this year by Lady Gaga and Matt Bomer as a pair of swingers/slashers. \nVerdict: Skip that WATCH THIS \n“The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman,” 10 p.m. PBS This six-week science series begins with an interesting and sometimes unsettling exploration of how our brains interact with our environment to create what we perceive as reality. \nEagleman, a professor of neuroscience, uses optical illusions, experiments and personal stories to illustrate how our brains take a portion of the world around us and mix it with our experiences to generate our understanding of the world. Eagleman calls this internal model “a beautifully rendered simulation” of reality. UC Irvine neuroscience professor Alyssa Brewer is among those featured. SKIP THAT \n“Young & Hungry,” 9 p.m. ABC Family It’s fitting that ABC Family is changing its name to Freeform in January. It stopped trying to produce family entertainment a while back, and “Family” is now an impediment to drawing its core audience of women 14 to 34. And what do they like to watch? Wan sitcoms, apparently, if this dull blob of a show is any indication. “Young & Hungry” wraps its second season tonight, \nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.
