But, while the play, which Wednesday night kicked off Philadelphia Theatre Company's 41st season, offers plenty of verbiage on the subjects of racism, ethnic identity and America's centuries-old love-hate relationship with immigration, it never gets a convincing grip on them.\nThe one-act, 85-minute piece, which runs through Nov. 8, plays out entirely on Jason Simms ' realistic rendering of a posh Upper East Side apartment. Its owners are Amir and Emily, a yuppified couple who seem to have the world by the tail.\nAmir (played by Pej Vahdat , of TV's \"Bones\" fame) is a Pakistani-born \"apostate\" Muslim who ostensibly has forsaken the religion of his ancestors and seamlessly assimilated. That he works for a big-deal law firm founded by Jews is evidence of Amir's assumed renunciation of his spiritual upbringing. But nothing is ever as it seems where Amir is concerned.\nHis wife, Emily ( Monette Magrath ), is what author Philip Roth would have called a \"shiksa goddess.\" She's a blonde WASP and an up-and-coming artist with an abiding interest in, of all things, Islamic art and culture.\nThey seem to lead a blessed life - until, at the urging of his on-the-road-to-radicalization teenage nephew (who has assumed the nom de America \"Abe Jensen\") - Amir agrees to be one of a number of lawyers at the hearing of a neighborhood imam jailed on charges of funneling charitable donations to Hamas.\nA subsequent New York Times article erroneously implies that Amir is the attorney-of-record for the suspect, and Amir's life begins its inevitable unraveling.\nThe plot is further complicated by the play's other two characters, the married couple Isaac and Jory. Isaac ( Ben Graney ) is a nonobservant Jewish art dealer intending to promote Emily's works. African-American Jory ( Aime Donna Kelly ) is a co-worker of Amir's whose career is headed in the opposite direction of his.\nThe two couples get together for what is supposed to be a celebratory dinner party (Isaac has finally agreed to give Emily a show). It quickly disintegrates into an orgy of recrimination, repressed prejudices set loose and, for good measure, some good, old-fashioned infidelity.\nA lot of verbiage - including the N-word - is flung before the somewhat predictable denouement. But because Akhtar's script is wider than it is deep, and because the four main characters are all, in their own ways, unsympathetic and even unlikable, it's difficult to really care about their trials and tribulations.\nThe cast is perfectly fine, if a little mannered and stagy ( Mary B. Robinson 's direction is solid, but mostly by-the-numbers). Vahdat does most of the heavy lifting as Amir, but he never gets fully lost in his character. The best of the lot opening night was Kelly, who played Jory as a real firecracker, and made her the most three-dimensional of the program's characters.\nOccasionally, she and Graney's Isaac engaged in some funny, sitcom-style husband-and-wife bickering that gave the very serious script a much-needed goosing. But these interludes were far too brief and scarce, and were ultimately swallowed whole by the play's striving for gravitas and important thoughts.\nSuzanne Roberts Theatre, 480 S.
