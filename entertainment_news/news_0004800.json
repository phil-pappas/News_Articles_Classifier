What we know about the new Star Wars film \n\"There were some booking delays in the initial peak, but our website is now returning to normal speed.\" \nA spokeswoman for Cineworld, which has sites in Wednesfield and Telford, added: \"We're aware that some customers have been unable to book tickets for Star Wars: The Force Awakens at a small number of Cineworld cinemas. What do you think? Log in and leave your comments below \n\"We know just how excited our customers are about getting their hands on tickets and we're hoping to have the remaining tickets online shortly.\" \nAt the Electric Cinema in Birmingham, only the venue's film club members were able to get their hands on tickets yesterday, with them not going on general sale to the public until today. \nDavid Baldwin, assistant manager, said the venue had been preparing itself for the rush. \n\"We're expecting demand to be high,\" he said. \"We don't know what to expect, because the Phantom Menace prequels weren't as well received. We're hoping it will be a lot better, and we're thinking it certainly will be. Director JJ Abrams was a very good choice. \n\"It's Bond versus Star Wars for us. We're hoping there's a lot demand – there certainly was for 007's Spectre.\" \nMr Baldwin said that people had been joining the cinema's Electrolyte Club film group just to get tickets for Star Wars. \n\"One of the benefits of the membership is you get priority booking,\" he added. \n\"We've had some calls, but it's been more online. I imagine today will be very busy.\" \nThe ticket frenzy comes as the final poster for the film was released earlier this week, showing older versions of Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca. \nAnd last night, a brand new trailer was shown at the American football game between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. \nStar Wars 7: The Force Awakens is the first new Star Wars film to hit cinemas in more than a decade.
