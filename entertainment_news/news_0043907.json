By Marty Sliva Paris Games Week is almost upon us, and Sony has already confirmed that it’s going to have a massive presence at the show . Aside from hands-on impressions of a ton of upcoming PlayStation 4 games, IGN is going to be the place you want to be to watch Sony’s next big press conference. When to Watch Tune in for our live pre-show on Tuesday, October 27 at 8:30am PT (11:30am ET, 4:30pm GMT, Wednesday October 28 at 2:30am AET) . We’ll be on hand to take a detailed look back at Sony’s 2015, and predict what we’ll learn from 2016 and beyond (!). At 9am PT, we’ll transition into Sony’s live stream of the conference. (Note: We’re hosting Sony’s stream, not producing our own. We don’t anticipate any issues, but keep that fact in mind.) After the conference, our panel of editors and hosts will dissect each and every announcement from Sony’s big show of fall 2015. Following that, stick around IGN all week for previews, interviews, news, and features about all the big games in Paris.
