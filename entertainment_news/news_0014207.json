You can get your fill of monster trucks, music and more with the Southern California Fair at the Lake Perris Fairgrounds.\nWhile the fair has lots of rides and plenty of food, including an attempt at taking home the world record for largest funnel cake on Wednesday, here are three things that make the Southern California Fair worth a visit:\n1. Motorsports: You’d be hard-pressed to find another fair with as much love for motorsports as this one. From demolition derbies to monster trucks, the Southern California Fair knows what the Inland market loves.\nMonster truck shows kick off opening weekend, with 1:30 and 7:30 p.m. sessions Saturday and Sunday.\nThe fair also has one of the hottest acts in motorsports: Metal Mulisha’s Fitz Army, hailing from Temecula, recently wrapped up a run on “America’s Got Talent.” See the motorcycle stunts up close at 7:30 p.m. Monday. The team will also conduct an autograph session.\nThere’s various racing throughout the week, but the demolition derby smashes into the fair at 1:30 and 7:30 p.m. Oct. 11.\n2. Music: The fair has gone big with country artists this season, but has also booked ’80s favorite Loverboy and a number of other interesting acts. The concerts, which start at 7:30 p.m., are included with fair admission.\nAmong the highlights: Loverboy, known for “Working for the Weekend,” on Tuesday; Chase Bryant and James Otto on Oct. 8 and Phil Wickham on Oct. 9.\nOther performers include Metalachi, a Journey tribute band, Olivia Holt and more.\n3. Animals: Inland students work hard raising animals for the fair. The livestock exhibits include a pygmy goat show, breeding show, horse show and more. And on Oct. 10, the students will part with their charges at the junior livestock auction.\nContact the writer: vfranko@pe.com or on Twitter: @vanessafranko", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvi2vp-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca356.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvi2vr-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca33p.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvi2vs-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca34i.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvi2vp-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca356.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvi2vr-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca33p.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvi2vq-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca35e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvi2vq-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca32r.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvi2vr-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca33t.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvi2vq-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca32r.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvi2vq-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca35e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvi2vs-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca34i.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvi2vr-b88526698z.120150930101916000gr3ca33t.10.jpg", "http://socalfair.com/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:30:10.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
