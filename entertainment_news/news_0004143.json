Still alive and able to speak unaided for lengthy periods, his act will be not so much a one-man show as an under-staffed cavalcade. \n“In an ideal world, Jeremy Hardy would be extremely famous, but an ideal world would leave him without most of his best material.” (The Guardian) Jeremy is now an essential member of BBC Radio 4’s The News Quiz and is a regular guest on I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue and Just a Minute. \nHe has also done various bits of television, most notably, Now Something Else with Rory Bremner, Saturday Live, Blackadder Goes Forth, Loose Talk, Jack and Jeremy’s Real Lives with Jack Dee and If I Ruled the World with Graeme Garden and Clive Anderson.
