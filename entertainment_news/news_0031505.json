If you'd like to recommend a restaurant to be considered for a spot on a future \"Where to eat now in N.J.\" list, let us know in the comments section below. \nTHE BONNEY READ \nIn one month, chef James Avery has taken The Bonney Read and elevated it to the legendary ranks of Jersey Shore seafood houses with nearly a century of service under their belts. The Bonney Read is seated on the corner of Cookman and Bangs avenues in Asbury Park (the spot housed the sports lounge Baca for a few years), and has all the trappings of the classic seafood house. The decor is simple — subway tiles and beautifully carved distressed wood. The menu is very straightforward — this is a seafood house, so other than the Bonney Burger, landlubbers will be out of luck. But you're not here for a burger, you are here for amazing seafood. We recommend starting off with a hearty bowl of either the New England or Jersey Green chowder ($8) — both give you the soul-warming kick you'll need in the autumn. \nAll the shellfish here is so fresh, including the extremely meaty, succulent whole Maine lobster (market price). The Mexican shrimp ($25) comes in an overly generous serving, and taste like, as one diner put it, \"little lobsters.\" The fish and chips ($17) is probably one of the best you'll find at the Shore. The fish is lightly breaded, and you're getting an 80/20 ratio of fish to fry, which is usually the inverse at most establishments. Bonney definitely gets bonus points for serving everything in a big silver pots, an extremely unique enhancement to your seafood experience. Surprisingly, the desserts are divine - the Key lime pie (served in a oversized margarita glass) is extremely tart, while the orange butterscotch tart is the picture of subtle sweetness. 525 Cookman Avenue, Asbury Park, (732) 455-3352. \nTHE CONTINENTAL \nEclectic global cuisine set in a quasi-futuristic '50s/'60s-inspired setting with a panoramic view of The Atlantic Ocean ... all in a casino outlet mall. None of this sounds like it should work at all, but it does at The Continental. Located at the east end of the second floor of The Pier Shops at Caesars, the restaurant is part of The Starr Restaurant Organization (Morimoto, Buddakan), which runs a plethora of successful spots in the tri-state area. The restaurant has two areas — the outside features a waterway that surrounds the dining area. There's also the inside Sammy Davis Room, a very '50s diner-inspired room. The menu emphasizes high-end comfort dishes — tuna tartare potato skins, Buffalo chicken meatballs, pad Thai, chicken and waffles, falafel and wagyu sliders. The Pier Shops at Caesars - 1 Atlantic City Ocean, Atlantic City, (609) 674-8300. \nMS. FU'S YUMMY FOOD TRUCK \nIf you're in the market to sate your love of Asian fusion, follow Ms. Fu's Yummy Food Truck on social media, and you won't be sorry. The truck, owned and operated by Fumiji Aoki, mixes Japanese, Korean, Thai, Chinese and American cuisine. (While we opted for the yakisoba noodles for lunch, we were very tempted by the idea of ordering a pork roll, egg and cheese sandwich from an Asian fusion truck.) The yakisoba burst with flavor, and the chicken was beyond tender. We recommend coupling the noodles with an order of fried dumplings, which are filled with ground pork, napa cabbage, scallion and mushrooms. 300 Beachway Ave, Keansburg, (732) 991-8906 — but the truck is constantly on the go, so follow the truck on Facebook or Twitter . The yakisoba noodles from Ms. Wu's Food Truck (we sampled these in Metropark). Bill Bodkin \nMEATBALLS & BREWS \nDowntown Rahway is making a nice little comeback (which often goes unnoticed), and it's being anchored by the opening of a number of diverse restaurants like this. The same plan worked for Asbury Park and Hoboken, and it seems to be working in Rahway. Meatballs & Brews is at the heart of this comeback — serving as both a local tavern and purveyor of fine meatballs. The kitchen rolls out fresh meatballs daily, and for $7.95 you can create your own meatball dish. The meat options include classic beef, chicken, salmon, vegetable, spicy pork and a weekly special. From there you pick your sauce from the following options: classic tomato, mushroom onion gravy, Parmesan cream, spicy meat, and a weekly special. The rest of the menus serves up traditional bar fare, with nothing costing over $9.95. 1482 Main Street, Rahway, (732) 381-1066. \nSOCIAL 37 \nToms River is known as a town filled with chain restaurants and a WaWa on every corner. So it's a bit surprising to see a restaurant that looks like (and whose menu reads like) it came straight out of a hip pocket of Manhattan or Brooklyn. Social 37 emphasizes local, organic ingredient sourcing, warm hospitality, and unique menu items that lack pretentiousness. The menu sports such unique items as raw oysters, scallops, clams or fresh fish served on a Himalayan salt block ($12), pork belly with kimchi ($11), duck confit wood-fired pizza ($18), and duck fat fried smashed fingerling potatoes ($7). They also have an omelet dedicated to \"Park and Recreation\" icon Ron Swanson (it has a lot of meat in it). There's 25 beers on tap ranging from the expected (Guinness, Summer Shandy) to the obscure (Forgotten Boardwalk 1916, and Rinn Duin Lawnmower — straight from Toms River). 2 Route 37 W., Unit B2, Toms River, (732) 202-3737. \nTHE COUNTER \nThe specialization of restaurants has never been more apparent than in the recent trend of \"burger joints.\" Ranging from quick eateries to full-blown restaurants, the burger is all the rage these days. The Counter, which has locations across the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, is probably one of the more unique burger joints. Their concept is the burger equivalent of \"choose your own adventure.\" Diners are allowed to build their own burger from bun to meat to cheese to sauce and topping. The combinations you can create are deliciously numerous, and this is the recommended way of dining here. Yes, you can order direct menu options, but where's the fun in that? We tried a medium rare 1/3-pound hamburger with American cheese, a creamy garlic aioli, and an extremely runny sunny-side-up egg. The combination is burger nirvana, and it's the aioli that really makes the magic happen. For those looking for a more health conscious option, you can always order organic bison, ahi tuna, or homemade vegan veggie. Of course, if you're feeling like treating yourself, the birthday cake milkshake (or any shake they serve) is a great way to go. 374 Route 3 West, Clifton, (973) 594-8700 | 341 George Street, New Brunswick, (732) 543-1267. You can build your own burger at The Counter - like this one featuring a sunny-side-up egg, American cheese and garlic aioli. Bill Bodkin \nTIFFIN \nRestaurateur Munish Narula has created quite an epicurean empire for himself. He and his Narula Restaurant Group have found success with their Tiffin restaurant brand. This Indian restaurant has roots in the greater Philadelphia region as well as Cherry Hill and Voorhees. Recently, the group took a sojourn north to East Hanover to open its latest incarnation of Tiffin. The menu sports classic Indian fare (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian) including samosas, Tandoori chicken, and various selections of naan. For those unaccustomed to eating Indian food, there is a special $5 conversion platter. Just announce you've never had Indian food before and you'll be served a samosa or two pieces of onion bhaji, an 8-ounce portion of chicken tikka masala or saag paneer, basmati rice, plain naan and mango, tamarind and mint cilantro chutneys. 249 Route 10 E., East Hanover, (862) 701-5425 | 1892 Marlton Pike East, Cherry Hill, (856) 888-1155 | 300 White Horse Road, Voorhees, (856) 888-2775. \nZEPPELIN HALL RESTAURANT & BIERGARTEN \nWhen October rolls around, your inner Bavarian begins to rear its head (whether you're of Bavarian descent or not is of no consequence). Suddenly the thought of consuming liters of German lager, strapping on lederhosen, playing the accordion, and wolfing down schnitzel sounds like the best idea you've ever had. Yes, there are a number of beer gardens and fest halls you could stop by, but the one we all know and love, Zeppelin Hall, is a must this month. The Zeppelin serves an amazing warm giant pretzel ($9.95) that you must dip in both the spicy brown mustard and obatzda cheese (not one or the other). They are renowned for their elaborate \"Sausage Fest\" menu, which celebrates all things \"meat in tube form\" (price ranges $6.95-$12.95). For those not in a Bavarian mood, Zeppelin serves a mean pulled pork ($9.95) and a grilled frankfurter ($4.95). While the weather remains decent, we recommend taking all dining outdoors at the Zeppelin. 88 Liberty View Drive, Jersey City, (201) 721-8888. You can't celebrate Oktoberfest in New Jersey without going to a German beer hall - what better place to do it than at Jersey City's Zeppelin Hall? (Zeppelin Hall) \nJUST RESTAURANT \nJust can easily be classified as a \"hidden gem\" because it's set way back on a sizable plot of land on Route 9 South behind a Delta gas station. It's not as visible as the gas station, but if you keep a sharp eye you'll see the words \"Just\" scrawled across the building in gold, and that's where you need to make your turn. Just has a wildly diverse dinner menu with entree options ranging from filet mignon ($34) to Tandoori chicken ($26) to Peruvian fried rice ($29) to a duck duet ($29). Just proudly serves a number of gluten-free dinner items, and critics from The Star-Ledger to The New York Times to Zagat have sung their praises. 2280 U.S. 9 South Old Bridge, (732) 707-4800. \nMEANBEAN \nThe Mexican lunch spot has been a difficult beast to master. On hand you've got Chipotle, on the other you've got the local hole-in-the-wall taqueria. The two couldn't be more different. So what if you wanted to find a place in the middle that serves the best of both those worlds, but also has a unique flavor identity onto itself? You look to downtown Toms River. MeanBean is located in the heart of the downtown, occupying the grounds of the old Java Joint. The burrito bowl with chicken is a definite must-have, and you really should take advantage of how good the guacamole and salsa is here when ordering. One of the first things you'll taste in a MeanBean burrito bowl is just how fresh the ingredients are. That not only enhances the taste, but also shows the dedication the owners have to making their food the best it possibly can be. If you're a football fan you can get unlimited chips with purchase of an entree, which is extremely tempting when choosing a Sunday football hang. 73 Main Street, Toms River, (732) 240-2326. A burrito 'bowl' is served up something fierce at the MeanBean in Downtown Toms River. Bill Bodkin \nBill Bodkin can be reached at bodkinwrites@gmail.com .
