Fourth Street. With a revamped program set to kick off next week, the center will host a grand opening celebration from 5-9 p.m. for the public to meet instructors and view their work, view exhibits and see what else is new at the downtown building, formerly known as the Visual Arts Center (VAC). Exhibits and education coordinator Lindsey Bailey-Kafonek said the center is turning over a new leaf by expanding beyond the visual arts. Another change comes from the addition of a central space for artists and community members to gather, share ideas and share and sell art. “I’m really enthusiastic about reopening the center, highlighting the fact that it’s now a multidisciplinary center for the arts, it’s not just visual,” Bailey-Kafonek said. “I definitely see this place as the creative hub for this city, for our community, for the arts to grow here.” During Friday’s event, which coincides with Oktoberfest, visitors also will have the opportunity to register for classes and learn more about membership benefits. “We’ve been working really hard with all the renovations in preparation for the big event,” Bailey-Kafonek said. “We are proud that we are completely turning over a new and different leaf.” The center was refashioned with a new name and plan after an audit uncovered alleged evidence of “unethical behavior” for its former management company, the Visual Arts Center of Northwest Florida, Inc., which is still under investigation by the Panama City Police Department. PCPD officials said Monday the investigation is “ongoing and extensive” and more details will be released as soon as they are available. The non-profit Bay Arts Alliance (BAA) took over management and operations of the city-owned building in July following a vote by the Panama City Commission to end its funding agreement with the VAC. The city contributes $90,000 annually toward the operation of the center. Since then, the BAA has been busy crafting a new program of classes and activities for the center and making improvements to the building, which features six classrooms and three events and exhibit spaces. While the schedule still includes plenty of traditional art classes, including drawing, watercolor and pottery, BAA Executive Director Jennifer Jones said the alliance also chose to mix in some new options based on responses from a recent online survey. Other classes to be offered this fall include acting, leather carving, break dancing, digital photography, clay mask-making, digital editing, improvisational music, fashion art and design, graphic design, linoleum block printing, poetry and more.

The Panama City Centre for the Arts is open from 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday and from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The center is closed Sunday and Monday. “The doors are open so people can come in and see the artwork and get information about the programs we’re offering,” Jones said. “It’s been very hand-on... getting it all cranked up again.” For more information about the center, visit www.pccentreforthearts.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:53:13.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
