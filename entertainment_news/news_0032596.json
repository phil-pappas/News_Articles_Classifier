In an interview with Collider while doing promotion for \" Da Vinci's Demons \", producer David Goyer said he's optimistic that \"Sandman\" would go into production as soon as possible. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been tapped to direct the movie. He will also write the script along with Goyer and Gaiman. Previous report that \"Sandman\" was moved from Warner Bros. to New Line Cinema made people wonder whether the film still had a chance of entering production. However, Goyer seemed to be confident that it would enter production. \"We're just about to do a new draft. All of the Vertigo properties ported over to New Line a few months ago. There was a decision from the higher-ups that New Line would focus on the Vertigo properties and Warner Bros would focus on the DC properties,\" the producer said. \"So we're just starting a re-write with a really fantastic writer that fans of your site will enjoy that's coming aboard, but I can't quite announce it yet.\" Goyer went on saying that the production might start next year. \"I think that the Vertigo properties are a bit more quirky and off-center than kind of the mainstream superhero stuff at Warners. But I understand the decision because we're not having to fight for release dates with the Vertigo stuff like we would have been having to do over at Warner Bros,\" he expplained. \"But I feel confident that film will go into production hopefully next year.\" \"Sandman\" was published between 1989 and 1996. The series followed Morpheus, the Lord of the Dreams, who is one of the seven Endless, personifications of abstract concepts. His main power among his various god-like abilities is being able to control all aspects of sleep, dreams and nightmares. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Sandman News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:29.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
