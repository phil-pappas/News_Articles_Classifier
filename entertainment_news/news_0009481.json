Kerala Blasters, after reaching the finals of the inaugural edition of the tournament, showed great fluency and verve during their tournament opener against NorthEast United. The Peter Taylor-led outfit looked like a complete team in every area of the pitch. Who could have predicted that they could have come up with a surprise weapon like Rahul Bheke’s throw in? This is a team that looks hungry to go all the way. However they will be missing the services of their influential centre-back Sandesh Jhingan yet again. As a result, Kerala have a backline complete with foreign players. \nAs for Mumbai City FC, they came a cropper against FC Pune City in their first match of the season. They have quite a task ahead of them here as well. Artur Moritz, after his heroics last season looked tame and went missing during large spells of the game. Coach cum player Nicolas Anelka came on from the bench in the last game and there is every chance that he will be starting this encounter. Like Kerala missing Jhingan, Mumbai will also be handicapped without their star Indian contingent. \nPhoto Courtesy: ISL’s official website \n  6:11 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:24:24.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
