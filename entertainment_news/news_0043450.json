We're not really sure whose it is. The late pop-art icon Andy Warhol came up with idea for the complex, zipper outfitted \"Sticky Fingers\" cover. If you unzip the original vinyl \"Sticky Fingers\" cover it reveals another photo of a crotch, this one clad only in tighty-whiteys. Legend has it actor Joe Dallesandro, who appeared in films made by Warhol (\"Flesh,\" \"Trash,\" \"Heat\") and otherwise (\"The Cotton Club,\" \"Cry-Baby\"), is the crotch model in question. However just this summer Glenn O'Brien, formerly editor for Warhol's Interview magazine, told New York Post reporter Larry Getlen it was him, O'Brien, in the interior, white briefs \"Sticky Fingers\" photo. O'Brien believes makeup artist Corey Tippin is the denim-packing dude immortalized on the \"Sticky Fingers\" cover. Warhol never dished on the \"Sticky Fingers\" model's identity and it's entirely possible even he didn't even know whose mid-section is depicted, as Warhol selected from Polaroids of various male models' crotches for the LP art cover. Crotches designer Craig Braun had previously photographed. \n'I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You,' Aretha Franklin, 1967 Recorded at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals \nJerry Schatzberg took the elegant cover photo of soul-sister Franklin. His other LP cover credits include Bob Dylan \"Blonde on Blonde\" and The Mothers of Invention \"We're Only In It For the Money.\" That famous shot of The Stones in drag for their 1966 single \"\"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" is Schatzberg's work too. He went on to direct films including \"The Panic in Needle Park\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose.\" \n'Brothers,' Black Keys, 2010 Songs recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio include 'Everlasting Light', 'Howlin' For You,' 'Sinister Kid' \nBlack Keys drummer Patrick Carney 's brother Michael Carney designed the blues-rockers' all-text \"Brothers\" cover and won a 2011 Grammy Award for Best Album Package . (Michael's been the art director for all eight Keys studio LPs.) The groovy font used on \"Brothers,\" Cooper Black might look familiar – it also graces classic covers such as The Beach Boys ' \"Pet Sounds\" and The Doors ' \" L.A. Woman .\" \n'3614 Jackson Highway,' Cher, 1969 Recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound \nSlinky pop singer Cher was the first artist to record an album at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, the facility Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (aka The Swampers) session musicians founded after parting ways with Fame mastermind Rick Hall. It was also Cher's first solo album. It's heavy on covers of artists like Dr. John, Bob Dylan and Buffalo Springfield. (Don't laugh. Cher's version of \"I Walk On Gilded Splinters\" is surprisingly effective.) The LP was titled \"3614 Jackson Highway,\" after Muscle Shoals Sound's now-famous address. \"On the album cover they put a blue oval with that address on it,\" said Muscle Shoal Sound Studio co-founder/Swampers bassist David Hood said during our 2014 AL.com interview. \"That was not really on the studio. After we saw that album then we had a sign made that looked like that to go on the front of the studio.\" The cover photo depicts Cher along with musicians and others involved with the \"3614\" LP. (Front row, from left: guitarist Eddie Hinton, bassist David Hood, Sonny Bono, Cher, producer Jerry Wexler, background vocalist Jeannie Greene and Donna Jean Godchaux aka Donna Jean Thatcher and producer Tom Dowd. Back row, from left: guitarist Jimmy Johnson, producer Arif Mardin, drummer Roger Hawkins and keyboardist Barry Beckett.) \n'There Goes Rhymin' Simon,' Paul Simon, 1973 Songs recorded at Fame Studios include 'Kodachrome' and 'Loves Me Like a Rock' \nMilton Glaser, best known for his \"I ♥ NY'' design and DC Comic's longtime \"bullet logo,\" orchestrated the wraparound, mixed-media cover art for \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon.\" \n'Hey Jude,' Wilson Pickett, 1969 Recorded at Fame Studios \n\"The Wicked Pickett\" looks wicked awesome in this portrait shot backstage at New York's Apollo Theater by Jim Cummins. Cummins' photographs can also be found on albums by Al Green (\"Green Is Blues\"), Sam & Dave (\"I Thank You\") and Aretha Franklin (\"Aretha in Paris\"). Life Magazine used one of Cummins' photos for their 1970 obituary for guitar-genius Jimi Hendrix. \n'Slow Train Coming,' Bob Dylan, 1979 Songs recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound include 'Gotta Serve Somebody' \nStill photographer and filmmaker William Stetz, credited as \"Wm. Stetz,\" created the cover concept and design for Bob Dylan's \"Christian album,\" \"Slow Train Coming.\" \n'Street Survivors,' Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1977 Songs recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound include 'One More Time' \nOn Oct. 17, 1977 Southern-rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd released their fifth studio album. Three days later their charted plane crashed in a Mississippi swamp and singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines and backing vocalist Cassie Gaines were killed. In a cold twist of fate, the original \"Street Survivors\" cover photo, shot at Universal Studios, depicted the band literally in flames. Steve Gaines was particularly ablaze and his eyes closed. MCA Records withdrew the cover and replaced it with a black-background photo that was originally on the back of the album. \n'Atlantic Crossing,' Rod Stewart, 1975 Songs recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound include 'Sailing' \nA panicked Warner Brothers art director reportedly contacted illustrator Peter Lloyd on a Friday afternoon after the artist the label previously lined up to do cover art for Rod Stewart's new LP flaked out. And Warners needed the cover by the next morning. Lloyd and an assistant stayed up all night creating the futuristic \"Atlantic Crossing\" art. They utilized a process that included drawing, stencils, color layering, erasing and airbrushing. Lloyd is said to have delivered the finished cover art by 9 a.m. Lloyd's sleek designs can also be found on albums by Jefferson Starship (\"Dragon Fly\") and Kansas (\"Song for America\"). \n'Sirens of the Ditch,' Jason Isbell, 2007 Recorded at FAME Studios, songs include 'Dress Blues' \nArt director Katherine Delaney's cover for Greenhill native Jason Isbell's first solo album after departing Drive-By Truckers features Scrabble letters, vintage keys and some sort of frog figurine. At the center, a black-and-white of Isbell, credited to Trent McGlinn and Hilary Walsh. Delaney's other credits include Faith No More (\"Album of the Year\"), Kris Kristofferson (\"This Old Road\") Alice Cooper (\"Dirty Diamonds\") and Old 97s (\"Blame It On Gravity\").", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:23:36.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
