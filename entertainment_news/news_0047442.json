Yet, there's one thing that absolutely remains the same: \nGarbage can be quite delightful. \nOf course, I'm talking about the band Garbage, the multiplatinum outfit that is fronted by iconic vocalist Shirley Manson. The group performed Wednesday at the Fox Theater, still sounding every bit as strong as it did when it was originally crafting such '90s modern-rock staples as \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" and \"#1 Crush.\" \nIt was the second date of Garbage's 20th anniversary tour. And, fittingly, the group didn't come to Oakland to hawk a new album, but rather to remember an old one -- Garbage's self-titled debut from 1995. \nManson and her four Garbage men — including producer extraordinaire Butch Vig on drums — opened the two-hour show by performing behind a translucent screen, looking like mere shadows as they cranked through the b-side \"Subhuman.\" \nWhen the screen lifted after one song, the troupe rocketed right off to the first album, quickly making fans aware that the intention was to play \"Garbage,\" more or less, from start to finish. \nThere is only one real drawback to that plan — the album isn't great. \nOh, it definitely has some great songs on it. Yet, it also has its share of filler. Advertisement \nPlus, it's quite top heavy, with nearly all of the best songs coming near the start. That might be a great plan for a debut record, giving an act its best chance of catching the busy ear of a radio station music director. But it also translates to an anticlimactic concert experience, since all the biggest thrills come early in the set list. \nStill, Manson's vocals were amazingly powerful as she rocked through the album opener, \"Supervixen,\" and then moved straight into the powerful \"Queer.\" She'd captivate the capacity crowd with \"Only Happy When It Rains,\" spurring some 2,800 voices to cry out together, \"Pour your misery down on me!\" \nThe show wouldn't reach those heights again until the encore. Instead, the enthusiasm slowly seemed to leak out of the building as Garbage continued through the tracks from the debut album. The musicians were all business during the first half, taking a break between side one and side two. (Kids, ask your parents to explain the whole side one, side two concept.) \nGarbage used the break to play some rare B-side material and other such cuts, including a cover of The Jam's \"The Butterfly Collector.\" \nThe group then queued up side two, eventually bringing the main set to an end with a tasty \"Milk,\" which is the rare side two gem to be found on \"Garbage.\" \nManson and the band quickly returned for a generous encore, highlighted by \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" and \"#1 Crush\" as well as some very good news for fans who might've been thinking that this anniversary tour was Garbage's last. \n\"This is not our swan song,\" Vig told the crowd. \"We are almost finished with our sixth album. \n\"We are going to come out and tour again next year.\" \nFollow Jim Harrington at twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:50:53.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
