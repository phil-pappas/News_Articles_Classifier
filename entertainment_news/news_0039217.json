After shock jock Howard announced he was leaving the program in June, the rumor mill began buzzing that Simon would take his seat and the outspoken star has now admitted the speculation is true. \n\"We've been talking about it for a few years, funny enough, me and NBC,\" he told Us Weekly. \"This year ... everything worked. So it was perfect.\" \nSimon initially began discussing joining the series with producers five years ago, but his other commitments got in the way. \nTV fans are used to seeing the star delivering withering putdowns to hopefuls on shows such as \"The X Factor,\"\"American Idol\" and \"Britain's Got Talent,\" but he's insisted he has no interest in making hopefuls feel bad this time around. \n\"I'm not going to lie to people when I think they're hopeless, I just couldn't do that!\" he explained. \"But no, of course I'm not going to be rude for the sake of being rude. That would be ridiculous. I'll take it act by act.\" \nHoward announced he was quitting on his radio show, explaining he'd been offered other work which meant his schedule wouldn't allow for another run of \"America's Got Talent.\" \nHe joined the show for its seventh season in 2012, replacing Piers Morgan, and stayed until season 10, which finished in September. \nHe sat on the panel alongside comedian-and-actor Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum and Mel B, although at the moment it's not known who will be judging with Simon in the next season. Mel already has some experience working with Simon, with the pair both presiding over the panel of \"The X Factor UK\" in 2014.
