After running through a 52-minute set at the Warfield in San Francisco on Saturday, where he'd been tapped to perform at a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee , where President Obama was in attendance, the future presidential candidate popped by the Westin St. Francis in downtown San Francisco, where call backs for \"Idol\" were being held. Making for a prime photo op for the show, which is entering into its final season, the rapper offered up an a cappella rendition of “Gold Digger,” a 2005 tune that original featured Jamie Foxx that namechecks Jennifer Lopez. West’s wife Kim Kardashian shared the moment with her 48 million Instagram followers, as did the show’s host, Ryan Seacrest. West is reportedly working on a new album, while the final season of \"American Idol\" is set to begin airing after the first of the year. Besides San Francisco, auditions for the fifteenth installment of the reality series were held in half a dozen cities, including Little Rock, Philadelphia and Denver.
