But a number of factors make a Roth account more compelling.\nTaxes remain a big reason. With a traditional account, your contributions are tax-deferred. After retirement, your withdrawals are taxed as regular income. It’s just the opposite for a Roth account.\nAt first glance, it doesn’t seem to make a difference which one you choose, if you assume your income tax rate remains unchanged after retirement.\nLet’s assume you contribute $1,250 a year for 10 years to either a traditional or Roth IRA. If the balances grow 10 percent a year and the tax rate remains 20 percent, both the traditional and Roth IRAs would end up with $17,531 after taxes. It’s a wash. The traditional account had bigger gains, but the Roth IRA had lower taxes.\nIf taxes increase, however, the Roth IRA is clearly preferred. If you assume a higher 25 percent tax rate in retirement, the traditional account gets hit with almost $1,100 more in taxes that reduces the balance to $16,436. The amount in the Roth IRA remains unchanged.\nConversely, if your ordinary income tax rate is lower in retirement, the traditional IRA is better. Few see the government lowering tax rates in the future, but keep in mind that your income — and tax rate — would likely decline in retirement.\nFunds contributed to your Roth IRA may be withdrawn at any time, for any reason, with no tax penalty. Note that this only applies to annual contributions and not the earnings on the funds. This gives you access to your contributions as a sort of an emergency fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:44:27.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
