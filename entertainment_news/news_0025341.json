Artists can select from a menu of sale, licensing, resale and remixing rights and can set their own price. Content buyers can acquire such rights directly, without brokers and with the comfort of knowing that title and artist attribution are verified through the block chain's cryptocurrency technology.\nLed by partners William Charron (who co-chairs Pryor Cashman's Art Law group), Rob deBrauwere and John Crowe , Pryor Cashman helped to form the company and to develop its intricate and cutting edge terms of use.\n\"Monegraph is paving the way for nearly instantaneous digital exchanges of art,\" Charron said. \"Just as people look for a little circled 'c' to know that something is copyrighted, in relatively short order they will look for the scripted 'M' to know that something is 'Monegraphed.' It will become part of the commercial art and legal vernacular.\"\nCharron represents a number of clients developing cutting edge approaches to dealing with problems of art authentication and title, and writes and speaks frequently on those topics. In May 2016 , Charron will be part of the second \"Authentication in Art\" working congress at The Hague, Netherlands .\nPryor Cashman LLP ( www.pryorcashman.com ) is an independent full service law firm with over 140 attorneys in its main office at 7 Times Square in New York City and an office in Los Angeles .
