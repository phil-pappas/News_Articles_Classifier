A verdict could come on Oct. 30.\nKaczynski said his party, which has been leading in opinion polls, would not offer Polanski any special treatment, despite his celebrity status in Poland.\nPolanski has Polish roots and is in the process of making a movie in Poland.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
