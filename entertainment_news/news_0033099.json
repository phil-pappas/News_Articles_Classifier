He has said he was misquoted. He never meant what was in fact showed in the media. He really condemns the incident, which happened in Faridabad… I think we should not blow the whole thing out of proportion,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters here. (Also Read: V K Singh’s dog analogy over dalit burning kicks up storm) When asked about AAP’s announcement that it will file an FIR demanding Singh’s arrest, he said the Arvind Kejriwal-led party is not answering questions about Delhi, where it is the ruling party, and is interfering everywhere else. Ask the AAP, what did it do when a child from Odisha, Avinash died of dengue because he could not get admitted to a hospital and his parents committed suicide, Patra questioned. It is better that they take care of the state for which they have mandate, he added. When some reporters asked about some comments about media which they claimed Singh had made, Patra said he was not aware of any such remarks but added that the BJP holds the media in high esteem. Singh was at the centre of a controversy over his comments that the Centre cannot be blamed if somebody throws a stone at a dog. \nModified Date: October 22, 2015 7:09 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:39:34.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
