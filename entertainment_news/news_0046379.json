The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup. \nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27. \nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. \n___ \nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/ Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:18:09.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
