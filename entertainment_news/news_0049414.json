That start helped the rest of Noah’s first week to better ratings than Stewart had averaged in his last quarter.\nBut now what?\nCuriosity will only drive viewers to the show for so long. Soon, Noah and the rest of “The Daily Show” cast will have to rely on their performances to keep those viewers coming back.\nThey will need to be better than they were in a decidedly rough first week. Noah seems intent on making the show less pointed and more congenial, with less political commentary and more straight-up joke-making. That will be an adjustment for fans of Stewart, who came to enjoy his show for its relentless skewering of political nonsense and hypocrisy.\nSure, “The Daily Show” under Stewart had a clear liberal bent, but its popularity owed more to its deft popping of hot air balloons floating in from all directions.\nNoah took a markedly gentler approach. There were bits about pumpkin spice coffee, the vocal timbre of a translator, and a piece about racial bias among police that mostly made fun of the show’s own correspondents. Biting political satire these were not, nor were any of them outrageously funny.\nAn interview with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a favorite target of Stewart’s, was jovial and collegial and not particularly interesting.\nMost notable, though, was a piece of news Noah didn’t tackle. After Thursday’s college shooting in Oregon, Noah opened that night’s episode by declaring that he would not have anything to say on the topic.\nStewart never would have let an event like that go unaddressed, and viewers have a right to expect a TV news show – even a “fake” one as “The Daily Show” likes to call itself – not to blink when confronted with difficult topics.\nOf course, it is tough to evaluate the performance of a new host after just one week. Stewart himself took years to build “The Daily Show” into an influential force in popular culture. It’s absurd to think his replacement could do the same in four days.\nBut Noah inherits a very different show than Stewart did. Stewart came in after original host Craig Kilborn was fired, and the expectations were extraordinarily low. Stewart used to joke that “The Daily Show” was mainly there to fill time between episodes of “Battle Bots,” then Comedy Central’s No. 1 show.\nNoah arrives to take the helm of a show that has won the Emmy in its category 10 times and is a giant profit center for Viacom. He won’t get years to prove himself.\nThe big questions are how long he will get, and whether he can meet the deadline.\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter or The Watcher on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:05:06.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
