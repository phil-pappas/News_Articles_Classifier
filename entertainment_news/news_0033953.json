But a woman’s capacity to fight it depends on various factors, and one being their immigration status. Victims of domestic violence, especially undocumented immigrants, continue being in an abusive relationship because they have nowhere else to turn. That is where Raksha can help. Raksha , a Georgia based nonprofit organization, works primarily with such survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other violent crimes. “Raksha’s mission is to promote a stronger and healthier South Asian community through confidential support services, education, and advocacy,” Aparna Bhattacharya, the director of Raksha, said. However, one of the biggest challenges in catering to these distressed women, Bhattacharya explained, is reaching out to them. “It is difficult for women in our community to even pick up the phone and call our helpline due to myriad cultural and social factors which include community backlash, familial disapproval, and the slow deterioration of self-esteem that survivors face,” she said. “In addition to these factors, undocumented immigrants are also often afraid of deportation.” The fear of deportation often keeps them from reporting and seeking legal help that can be extended to undocumented women. “The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has crime victim visas that are available. Under VAWA, most programs cannot discriminate against undocumented survivors, especially federally funded programs,” Bhattacharya explained. “Raksha assists survivors in navigating criminal, civil, health, social service, educational and immigration systems.” Raksha not only provides services to battered women but also extends services to children who are often overlooked in such cases. “Child custody is often a contentious issue when a survivor is able to break away from his or her abuser,” she said. “Often, an abuser will use custody of any children as an instrument to drag out litigation and to maintain some aspect of control over the survivor’s life. In some instances, there are threats to take children out of the country and away from the reach of a navigable American justice system. The Center for Missing and Exploited Children (1-800-THE-LOST) is a great resource for parents who are concerned about international abduction.” The organization provides comprehensive case management services and therapeutic services for all ages to help survivors and their families face the future in a healthy and integrated manner. Raksha also provides training on the South Asian culture and the immigrant experience to police officers, attorneys, and judges to better serve the community when law enforcement is involved. “By doing so, we ensure that the future generation of service providers are aware of the needs and issues that our community faces,” Bhattacharya said. Being the only social service organization in Georgia that caters to South Asian population, the organization also offers support services such as support groups for adults and children, culturally relevant family counseling, individual counseling for both children and adults in several South Asian languages, support in getting basic needs like finding housing, medical and legal referrals, or going back to school or getting a job. “Many youth spend their time at the Raksha offices because that’s the one place they feel safe and can be themselves,” Bhattacharya said about the organization that has successfully served and empowered over 500 clients. And as the South Asian community continuous to grow in size, the need for organizations like Raksha is becoming important. “As the community grows, more families are in need of the community-building activities that range from teen community groups to job hunting assistance, from help in navigating the school system, to trips to the aquarium,” Bhattacharya elaborated. To better serve their growing needs of the community, the organization hosts an annual fundraiser “ Ek Shaam Raksha Ke Naam ” (An Evening in the Name of Raksha) where every year, the members of the community gathers to celebrate and support the organization. This year’s fundraiser will celebrate Raksha’s 20th year of serving Georgia’s South Asian community. The event will feature a fusion on jazz and South Indian Classical music by Indo-Pak Coalition, a jazz trio consisting of Rudresh Mahanthappa, Rez Abbassi, and Dan Weiss. This will be followed by a Bollywood after party featuring DJ Sahib and DJ Raman Singh at Sidebar, and is free for all Ek Shaam Raksha Ke Naam attendees. \nModified Date: October 2, 2015 1:32 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:08:45.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
