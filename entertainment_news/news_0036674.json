The 30-year-old, who had just started at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., was shot five to seven times.\nHe’s recovering in a hospital, a day after the shooter identified as Chris Mercer killed at least nine students and wounded several others. It was the fourth case of a college campus shooting since August.\nRELATED: 14 myths debunked (or verified) about gun violence\nMintz acted when he heard shots fired in the classroom next to him, his cousin Ariana Earnhardt told WFMY-TV in Greensboro, N.C .\n“He heard the gunshots so he told the people in his classroom to just be calm,” Earnhardt said. “He came and he met the shooter at the door. He was like you need to calm down. I guess he tried to talk to him and talk him out of it and he shot him.\"\nEarnhardt said Mintz moved from North Carolina to Oregon to be closer to his son. The student charged the gunman apparently on the sixth birthday of his son, Tyrik. The Daily Beast reported that as he lay wounded, Mintz kept repeating: “It’s my son’s birthday, it’s my son’s birthday.”\nREAD MORE: The latest on the Oregon community college shooting\nAnother one of Mintz’s cousins, Derek Bourgeois, told the Daily Beast he was amazed “that a guy who survived a combat deployment without serious injury had come so close to being killed in a small Oregon town.” But he was not shocked by Mintz’s act of heroism.\nSaid Bourgeois: “It sounds like something he would do.”", "external_links": ["http://www.wfmynews2.com/story/homepage/2015/10/02/oregon-shooting-family-says-triad-man-hero/73190336/", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/02/forget-oregon-s-gunman-remember-the-hero-who-charged-straight-at-him.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:21:19.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
