Well, the real life inspiration part of the Dove comes as breaking news for an all-women crew who are waiting to release their movie which is in news since it took off.\nThe best part of Anup’s debut venture is that it is not completely marred by the typical temptation of announcing a future star. Well, for that to become a reality the debutant definitely needs to work a lot and instead of reaching for the ‘stars,’ it would be more appropriate for him to refine his acting skills.\nThe highlight is the plot inspired by a real life incident, shot boldly, for which the censor has rightly used its scissors well. Again, a typical subject for a debutant with a filmy connection, wherein a poor guy from a moderate middle class family, falling for a rich girl. For Aditi Rao, Dove being her actual debut film is best when she is showering love on puppy.\nThe steaming part is the lust portion in which Rakesh and Madalsa does raise the tempo with bold act which starts to build up in the second half. By interval, there is a twist, in which the hero is fixed in the murder of a techie guy, who is a son of a police officer. By far Santhu has done a fair job while stretching his imagination in biding a story inspired by a real life incident. However, climax could have been a little practical where the ‘heroism’ bug bites the director in glorifying the hero who alone fights the dreaded criminals who kill four out of five well-trained police officers in the end before justice is served!\n entertainment Sandalwood Dove Anup Sa Ra Govindu Aditi Rao Rangayana Raghu Also Read Distributor’s vouch for Sooraj-Athiya's 'Hero' success Shah Rukh Khan's 'Slam' tour generates great excitement in US Kangana Ranaut turns 27 Salman Khan to sport a new look", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/_MG_2319%5B1%5D_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/_MG_2319%5B1%5D_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/entertainment-movie-review/article/movie-review-‘dove’-love-and-lust-debut", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:14:50.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
