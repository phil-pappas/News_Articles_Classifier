State Police say Quaid has been taken into custody while trying to cross from Canada into the United States. State Police say the \"Independence Day\" actor was detained by troopers at the Highgate Springs port of entry, days after Canadian officials said he would be deported. Quaid is wanted in Santa Barbara, Calif., to face felony vandalism charges filed in 2010 after he and his wife, Evi, were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned.
