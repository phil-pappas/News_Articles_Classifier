FRANK BELLINO, FILE PHOTO Related article » RELATED:\nINLAND WEATHER: Organizers hope heat won't deter crowds\nHEAT ADVISORY: Friday expected to hit 100 degrees\nAGRICULTURE: Odd weather a burden for growers\nA year’s worth of wild weather, leading into this weekend’s expected heatwave, has caused some headaches for area growers.\nTo start, 2015’s grape yield in the Temecula Valley was down, and the harvest happened much earlier than usual.\n“Most of the grapes have already been picked,” said Krista Chaich, a representative for the Temecula Valley Winegrower’s Association. The harvest is usually finished around the end of October.\nNow, the late-season high temperatures are playing havoc with avocado growers in the region.\nJ.D. Harkey, director of operations for Temecula-based Drake Enterprises, which manages production for various wineries and avocado farms, said hot weather means avocado trees need more water than they normally do this time of year. However, he said giving the trees more water is a difficult balancing act during a drought.\n“We really have to be watching our allocations,” Harkey said. “You have to be very careful about how and when you use your water.”\nHarkey said the fall heat is just the latest in a string of unusual weather events, from snow in January to sudden hot and cold spells spanning February through August. Drake Enterprises' grapes produced less than they normally do and they matured faster.\n“I only had three varieties that produced average or above average yields,” Harkey said. “Anything else was a reduction of anywhere from 20 to 60 percent.”\nHarkey said sugar and PH levels in the grapes harvested were normal, but it’s still too early to tell what the eventual outcome will be.\n“Only time will tell if the wine from these grapes is negatively affected,” he said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9693 or agroves@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvx9ia-b88535471z.120151008150601000ggkcfndv.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvx9ia-b88535471z.120151008150601000ggkcfndv.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:12:12.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
