It’s not altogether there, it’s not been a tsunami, but there’s waves of better roles for women. \n“I think the business has been paying attention to that as well, which is the thing we needed, we needed the money in the business to pay attention to the fact that these films make money with women at the core of them. \n“We’ve got ways to go with equality of billing and pay and all of that – but we’re getting there.” \nThe movie may be a tense, violent thriller, but Emily said that didn’t affect the fun of filming at all. \nShe explained: “I know it seems very dark, and a very intense film, a very arresting film – but yet on set it was a lovely atmosphere. I think I’m someone who has to be happy to do the best work that I can do, so I usually try and keep it light.” (Jordan Strauss/Invision) \nLondon-Born Emily is rumoured to be in the running to star in the Mary Poppins sequel announced in September – in the role made famous by Julie Andrews. \n“I’ve heard rumours of it, which would be a thrill,” she admitted. “But there’s nothing official. She’s sort of an icon, so that would be kind of scary.” Share article \nSicario is in cinemas now.
