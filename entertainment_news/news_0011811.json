MORE: The Daisy Theatre's huge cast of characters gives Calgary a chance to see edgy puppetry \nAfter back-to-back sold out runs in Calgary, the Blythe Festival and Toronto, Burkett took a much-deserved hiatus to create three new puppets and then headed down to New Zealand for a tour. \nOn his way back to Calgary he stopped in New York and took over the Baryshnikov Arts Centre for two weeks of standing room only performances. \n\"Though I've been to Australia seven times, I only ever played Auckland once in 2007 so it was great to return,\" he said. \n\"The Aussies and the Kiwis get me in a way the Americans don't because, like Canada, Australia and New Zealand are colonies of Great Britain and I have a British camp sensibility that's rooted in the naughty Carry On films and stage shows.\" \nThe only thing Burkett has to do when he's Down Under is \"to slow down. \n\"I tend to go a mile a minute and I'd lose those audiences if I used the same pacing I do in Calgary.\" \nHe says he loves playing New York because \"there are so many puppeteers in that area which means I'm guaranteed at least one of them will be at each show and they'll come back to chat after the performance. \n\"The Jim Henson Foundation hosted my opening night reception.\" \nStill the one place he still feels most at home is Calgary where his career started 40 years ago. \n\"Calgary is one audience I know inside out and who I adore playing for.\" MORE: Puppeteer Burkett wins $75G theatre prize \nIn addition to several new skits for the return engagement of The Daisy Theatre, Burkett has created three new cast members. \n\"I've got a new performer called Fanny LeGrand for the opening burlesque number. She'll be alternating with Dolly Wiggler the farm girl stripper so that every opening will not be the same. \n\"Fanny still needs her strings but I'll get around to that before I pull into Calgary.\" \nAlso new will be Tony Rubato, who'll sing a jazz number. \n\"He's a very classy, uptown Italian lounge singer. \n\"Very Old Vegas like Dean Martin. His song is I Only Think of You When I'm Drunk which ends up being quite often because Tony drinks a lot.\" \nThe third new troupe member is Mrs. Clara Dribbles who Burkett explains \"is a small town society dame who presents her own concerts. \n\"When she comes on, Clara is drunk on brandy.\" \nEvery audiences won't necessarily see all three new thespians because Burkett says he likes \"to go to work and just play with the audience. \n\"I like to get a feel for the kind of crowd I have each night and then decide what skits to include. \n\"In that way, the audience really decides what show they'll see on any given night.\" \nTickets for The Daisy Theatre are on sale at artscommon.ca or by phone at 403-294-9494.
