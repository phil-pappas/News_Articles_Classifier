MillerFor The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 5:29 pm Updated at 5:46 PM In his younger days, having completed a project, Guy Davis was happy when his parents (the acting tandem of Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee) rewarded him with a check, intended for a nice vacation. Instead, Davis used it as a stake for several weeks of of surviving in New Orleans as a street singer, embarking upon a career as a blues and folk performer that has won him plaudits around the globe. Davis will be appearing Thursday night at the Spire Center in Plymouth, celebrating the release of his latest album, “Kokomo Kidd,” which came out a few weeks ago. “Back in the day, I just had to see what I could do,” said Davis, from his home in New York state. “My folks had given me some money, after I’d accomplished something, and I’m sure they figured I’d probably go to the Bahamas or something like that. I went to New Orleans and sang on the street, because by then it was very clear to me that I wanted to perform. I didn’t want to just be a writer, or collaborator, as I’d already done. I wanted to stand out front and make music.” Davis’ first forays into music came when he attended a summer music camp in Vermont, which was run by Pete Seeger’s brother, John Seeger. Being introduced to guitar, banjo, and singing around the campfire, he was soon hooked on music. “Every day I’d be seeing people getting up and leading sing-alongs,” said Davis, now 63. “I felt like that was just the most wonderful thing. I began trying to learn guitar and banjo, and singing. I think my first gig was when they let me do a set at the Clearwater Fest, and I got about seven dollars. I don’t know how good I was in those first days, but I always liked Woody Guthrie’s quote about how you know when you can really play guitar: when people don’t get up and run away.” Davis’ special genius lies in his ability to interpret classic old songs and yet deliver them in a modern, and very individual manner, full of warmth and soul. In addition, he has a good ear for choosing contemporary material and rearranging it for either his solo or stripped down band formats. And on top of that, he’s a deft writer who can inject the classic blues form with new life and edgy modern topics. On the new album, the title cut is a rollicking kind of rhythmic blues, with lyrics that decry many of the frustrations of our social and political situation. Later in the album, Davis has crafted a stunningly poignant perspective of a woman enduring an abusive relationship in “She Just Wants To Be Loved.” Those are two of the most memorable songs of 2015. “I want to cover contemporary topics,” said Davis. “That was also always a side of John Lee Hooker’s music, where he’d have younger musicians kicking it with him. But there are several reasons I want to bring the blues into modern times. I really need no other reason than to simply widen my market, and of course I just don’t want to limit myself to just doing the old-time stuff all the time. On that track, ‘Kokomo Kidd,’ I think I got a sound that’s old and young at the same time. The verses are almost like rapping – and my son’s tutelage helped me use some words I wouldn’t have normally used before. But the topic in ‘Kokomo Kidd’ is that it’s kind of a celebration of the corruption we see in Washington, D.C. It didn’t just stop 100 years ago, so some of those old blues themes are still apt, but this song puts a new spin on it.” “Writing ‘She Just Wants To Be Loved’ was quite an experience,” Davis said with a sigh. “I knew before it even took form, in the early stages of writing, that it could be quite good and quite deep, and unlike anything I’d ever done before. I was even scared, because I’d never tried to look into anything that deep before in a song. It came out of me because I really did get a phone call from a woman like that, and she got really emotional, but the song goes beyond that to aspects of abuse and isolation of women in general. I don’t know that I wanted to solve the problem, but at least to bring it up. I think the only conclusion is in the refrain, ‘She just wanted to be loved.’ There is no simple way to talk about that song, or that subject, but when we listened back to my demo, we knew we had something.” “My band had never heard me do a song where I went that deep,” Davis recalled. “But they took that song, lifted it up and made it fuller. It was also ironic, the day I was supposed to go in and conduct the background vocals for that tune, my manager called and reminded me of a gig I had that day out west. One of my friends came in as my ears, and came through for me, bringing that song to fruition with those great background vocals.” One of the notable classics covered on Davis’ new album is Bob Dylan’s “Lay Lady Lay,” where instead of the original’s easy bumping country vibe, Davis makes it a soul song with more palpable yearning. That won’t surprise longtime Davis fans, who no doubt remember his transformative cover of Dylan’s “What’s A Sweetheart Like You (Doing In a Place Like This),” which was the title cut of Davis’ 2009 album. “Attempting to do a Dylan song goes back to that confidence thing,” said Davis. “There was a time I wouldn’t have dared to do that song, feeling I wasn’t good enough. I took some chances with this CD. I will further acknowledge that there is always room for improvement, and I think I have been improving. But ‘Lay Lady Lay’ was a success largely because of the band – Professor Louis (of the Crowmatix) and those guys really helped give it that Woodstock sound. And my buddy Chris James also put in a little mandolin part too, so those guys really delivered.” Along with his regular band members and some Woodstock guests, the new disc also includes guest spots from harmonica legend Charlie Musselwhite, and Ben Jaffe of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. “Kokomo Kidd” was also Davis’ first effort at producing his own record. “I don’t know what it took, why I was waiting for all these years to produce,” said Davis. “I think all it took is more confidence. I’m just more relaxed in my ability to accomplish creative work. I had worked with various people over the years. It took me such a long time before I could see that my thoughts and ideas really had worth. I think producing really helped me as a way of re-gauging myself and my strengths. “It started with the writing. Writing something and making it stick. I just gradually built more confidence in my abilities, my ear, and my ability to communicate with musicians, and having a clear idea of the outcome I wanted.” After his current string of dates around the eastern seaboard, Davis is slated for a few weeks of playing gigs in Canada’s Northwest territories, and then it’s off to Belgium and Italy in November. He’s busy constantly, and his acting credits include the lead role in the 1993 Off-Broadway production “Touch of the Devil,” where he played Robert Johnson. In 2012, he created the audio play “The Adventures of Fishy Waters: In Bed with the Blues.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:44:24.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
