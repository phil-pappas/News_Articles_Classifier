Bernie Sanders says he has an “ample supply of underwear,” despite how he was portrayed on Saturday Night Live this week. \nComedian Larry David imitated Sanders during Saturday’s SNL cold open, which re-created Tuesday’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas. David, the co- creator of Seinfeld , won praise for nailing Sanders’ thick Brooklyn accent. \n“I own one pair of underwear,” David said. “That’s it. Some of these billionaires they have three, four pairs.” \nAfter a house party in Iowa City on Sunday, Sanders assured reporters he is well-supplied. \n“Last week, I bought my second pair of underwear. That’s a joke. Please don’t write it down,” Sanders said. “I have an ample supply of underwear.” \nSanders said he only owned one suit while he was mayor of Burlington, Vt., but said he has increased his wardrobe during his tenure in the Senate. \nThe usually all-business Sanders joked around in a press gaggle. One reporter asked what it was about his life that draws people to his campaign. \n“I think it’s my hair that excites the American people. Neat. Well-groomed. Your typical politician,” he said. \nHe mentioned his dance moves on his appearance on Ellen last week. And he gave high marks to David’s take on him Saturday evening. \n“I think we’re going to put him up on the stage at our next rally,” Sanders said. “Let him do it rather than me. He does it better than I do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:18:30.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
