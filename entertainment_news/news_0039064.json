(March 20 - April 19): You know someone will have a knee-jerk reaction to suggestions, so don't provoke. Persuasion and gentle encouragement work best.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): A friend comes to you for advice on how to handle a thorny matter. Offer to listen, but don't intervene. It's pricklier than you know.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Continued resistance means you may be backing the wrong side. Some issues are open to debate. Apparently this isn't one of them.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): Today is the first time that you're hearing about certain conditions. Everyone accepts them as givens, but you should ask where they came from.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): You're not in as tight a spot as you think. Today's Sun/Moon trine in air shows there's plenty of help if you want it. All you have to do is ask.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You've patiently waited for an answer, but this person continues to drag his heels. Bring it to a head and ask for a yes or no by day's end.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): A friendly rivalry may not be as sporting as you think. Cool it with the verbal jousts. Someone is thinner-skinned than he lets on.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): Holding someone to a pledge that can't be fulfilled is fruitless. Find out what this person can deliver on. At least you end up with something.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): You adopted a strong stand to win respect, but it may be driving people away. Reintroduce some familiar geniality and they'll come back.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): Time for damage control. It's annoying how people are unable to do without you; but the fact that they can't is why you're still around.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): You can't continue to bail out colleagues. They need to take responsibility for actions. Ignore the predictable emergency call.\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): If you're going to judge according to the past, then you'd best close shop. If you're open to what the future might bring, then stick around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:46:15.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
