Be prepared to fulfill your fashion wishes and indulge in this mesmerizing collection launching Thursday, October 15th at the renowned Soho Arts Club in New York City. For more than a decade Fatboy, a Dutch based company known for fashion and comfort, has been bringing innovative lifestyle products to people in over fifty countries world -wide. Fatboy’s identity is anchored in iconic designs mixed with a creative spirit that extends into all their product offerings.\n“Alex Bergman, Founder and Creative Director of Fatboy, seeks to enhance experiences and spaces, both indoor and outdoor, by designing functional and unique furniture, lighting and lifestyle products that make a statement. The success of the Fatboy brand is a testament to his ability to design product with immense creativity and fortitude.” said Paula Masters, CEO and President of Fatboy USA . “The new rainwear collection is no different. It incorporates the elements of inspirational design and infuses into the world of fashion,” continued Masters.\nMaryMe-JimmyPaul , also known as MMJP, explores fashion in its own unique way, crafting clothing from drawing from their stories and experiences. MaryMe-JimmyPaul takes inspiration from American pop culture through a European lens, resulting in a distinctive mash-up of different pop cultures. They push the boundaries of shape, textures, and colors, raising eyebrows with big, sculptural works, crafting desirable and avant-garde clothing. Inspired from different disciplines within both the art and fashion worlds, MMJP takes the viewer into a beautiful and humorous fantasy fashion world through its unique presentation, which is why the collaboration with Fatboy evokes an immense amount of anticipation and excitement. Both brands see the world as grandiose and as a canvas that can be painted to create something fabulous!\nThe MMJP spring collection investigates what the designers envision as the origin of the idea of beauty and glamour, seen from a more romantic and sentimental perspective. They bring forth the idea of a beauty that is unrelated to the idea of appearance with the end goal of unleashing a new image of fashion, exploring shapes, structures, and surfaces. The new collection creates the perfect habitat where your senses are able to escape to a beautiful garden and hidden places within wearable spaces. Inspired by natural influences like landscaped parks, campgrounds, and waterfalls, MMJP gets its visual inspiration tools from the Japanese Zen garden. The inspiration for the new rainwear collection, created in collaboration with Fatboy and made from fabric used within their collections, is no different. Working with the ceremonial traditions and aesthetics from the Zen garden, MMJP took the influence of western jacket styles and combined them with the icon of Japanese culture, the kimono. The result is a playful, cosmopolitan and cheeky view on rainwear that is certain to carve a place in history.\nMMJP is partnering with New York based DATLOOK to curate the innovative, eye-catching presentation. The venue will be morphed into a space and place to engage fashion influencers and media from across the globe using pieces from the Fatboy product portfolio.\nEvent Information:\nCollection Reveal:\nThursday, October 15, 2015\n7:00 PM - 8:15 PM\nSoho Arts Club, 76 Wooster, NYC\nAfterparty:\n11:00 PM\nRumpus Room, 249 Eldridge Street, NYC\nEvent Contact:\nFor more information about the event please contact DATLOOK at info(at)datlook(dot)com.\nFor information about Fatboy and its products outside the US and Canada, please visit fatboy.com or email lotte(at)fatboy(dot)com\nFor all other inquiries, please visit fatboyusa.com or e-mail info(at)fatboyusa(dot)com\nAbout Fatboy\nFatboy® is a lifestyle brand that excels in thinking outside the box.
