But wait until she tries to decode a word of two of slang and viewers may find themselves bowled over with laughs. \nShe cannot seem to get a grasp on the slang words \"Chi-Town\" and \"dopeman.\" \n\"Chee Town, Chee Town, Michael Jordan just said text me\" she reads. \n\"Chee-Town what is that Chinatown?\" she asks incredulously. When the videographer clarifies Chi-Town stands for Chicago continues to ask why didn't Drake and Future just say that. \n\"Did you write these words? This is a professional?\" \n\"Dopeman\" she repeats over and over and surprisingly asserts her knowledge of the hip-hop term until she quite comically reveals she has actually confused it for the prescription drug dopamine. \n\"Dopeman, dopeman, dope. My husband had to take dopamine when he had a heart attack. That's how I remember that word. Dopeman. D-O-P-E-M-A-N. That's a prescription when you have a heart attack.\" \n\"Isn't that dopeman?\" clarifies the videographer. \n\"Oh God, I don't want to really know any of this STUPID POP CULTURE! I'm not interested in it,\" she yells. \nGranny has clearly had it as she comes after Drake and Future in tow. \n\"This is not Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett... that's Drake and The Future?\" \n\"Jesus Drake, I'm really ashamed of you because I know you're smart. He is right? I heard of him?\" \nLike how she heard of \"dopeman?\" \nThe video hit YouTube on Sept. 28 and is already going viral. It has reached over 63,000 views and 50 comments. The comments section yields a gang of people requesting uploader 3GoldenSistersTV to upload a video of granny actually listen to the song as well as others. America's Funniest Home Videos has even contacted 3GoldenSistersTV in the comments section looking to work together. \nHmmm... granny may not understand the lyrics but watching her decypher the lyrics is amusing enough. Maybe we will see this golden girl comically shame a few more rappers soon.
