(AP Photo/Danny Johnston) Sponsored Links The Associated Press COLUMBUS, Ohio â€” \nAn effort to legalize medical and recreational marijuana in Ohio is getting the backing of TV personality Montel Williams. \nThe celebrity who hosted \"The Montel Williams Show\" for a decade is scheduled to endorse Issue 3 during a Columbus appearance Wednesday. Williams also will announce opposition to Issue 2, a proposed ban on constitutional monopolies that's designed to block the marijuana effort. \nWednesday's event will include Ohio patients who could benefit from access to medical marijuana if the amendment passes Nov. 3. \nA spokesman said Williams does not intend to be an investor in any of the 10 authorized growing sites created by the proposal and has no current plans to be involved in the Ohio cannabis business. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that this is not Williams' first time getting involved in a marijuana legalization effort.
