I like the concept but I feel as though it is missing something. Brought to us by the same people responsible for The Black List, The Player offers up life-or-death circumstances that could make a lot of people a lot of money. \nThe show makes me wonder if such a game exists. As they say, if you can dream it, you can do it, and to be totally honest, it really wouldn't surprise me to discover there was a guy running around Vegas gambling with his life. If this did really happen, though, I doubt everything would be quite so convenient and clear-cut. \nWesley Snipes plays the mysterious Mr Johnson, the self-proclaimed Pit Boss of The House that takes bets on crime. Episode one sees Snipes open the series standing over the body of the last player in disappointment, leaving the audience wondering whether he fired the fatal shot that ended this particular player's life. \nThe show then takes a predictable turn when former FBI agent Alex Kane reunites with his ex-wife, only to wake up to her screams before she dies. \nEverything seems a little too convenient, making for a somewhat sloppy storyline. The supercomputer is just that little bit too good to be believable, and there is something slightly wooden about the character of Cassandra King - I'm still not quite sure whether this is an intentional character flaw or just down to the way Charity Wakefield portrays her. \nDespite this, The Player has potential. It just has a long way to go before it lives up to the standard set by The Black List. \nOn the positive side, the action sequences in The Player are quite good with plenty of bullets, explosions and car chases to keep the action junkies out there satisfied. Hopefully, the show develops more and becomes a must-watch offering instead of a must-miss. square eyes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:59:13.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
