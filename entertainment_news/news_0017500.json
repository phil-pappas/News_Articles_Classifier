He was 75. \nTiffanie Roppolo, the CFO of Prudhomme's businesses, told The Associated Press that he died early Thursday after a brief illness. \nPrudhomme became prominent in the early 1980s, soon after opening K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, a French Quarter diner that served the meals of his childhood. \nHe had no formal training, but sparked a nationwide interest in Cajun food by serving dishes — gumbo, etouffee and jambalaya — that were virtually unknown outside Louisiana. \nThe distinctly American chef became a sensation at a time when the country's top restaurants served virtually nothing but European food. \n____", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:09:00.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
