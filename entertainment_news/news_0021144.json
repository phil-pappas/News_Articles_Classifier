Credit: ITV Border One of the earliest tourist attractions in the Lake District has been re-opened to the public.\nFrom as far back as 1770 a \"viewing station\" above the lake at Windermere was considered a must-see.\nPeople would take in the views and enjoy dances as well.\nIt has now been restored by the National Trust.\nI think they would have been amazed at the view and the open space that they would have come to see.\nIt's still wild here isn't it? Still a beautiful place.\"\nâ€“ Elizabeth and Robert Corcoran Last updated Thu 15 Oct 2015 And Finally Cumbria Windermere National Trust", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:09:56.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
