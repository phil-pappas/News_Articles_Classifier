But his deep-seated inner performer, his Sammy Davis, Jr spirit animal, would not rest. \nSo he took a laptop beat he had made and wrote a stream-of-consciousness song about all of the things he needed, chief among them a brick on a string and a fire extinguisher, one of the big ones. He shot a video in his backyard on his phone and credited \"Fire Extinguisher\" to Howell Dawdy, a name every bit as made up as Lydia Burrell. \nThe whole thing killed a couple of days and then it was back to Lydia Burrell, only that didn't quite happen. \"Fire Extinguisher\" became a local hit and Dawdy an unexpected star who is part rapper, part stand-up comic. Smith followed with a series of wonderfully ridiculous videos, including \"Boo, I'm A Ghost\" and \"Summer Creams.\" \n\"I'd never had people respond so quickly and enthusiastically about anything I'd done,\" said Smith, 36. \"Howell was kind of a random thing that just happened. I thought it was like my side project that I would do in my spare time, but it is absolutely the thing that people want to book more than Lydia Burrell and the videos do better than my Lydia Burrell songs. \n\"It's become my main thing and Lydia is my labor of love. But I do love performing the Howell stuff live as much as I do anything.\" \nFriday night at Zanzabar, Smith will for the first time perform full sets as Dawdy and with Lydia Burrell, currently featuring Dave Givan, Trip Barriger and Nick Myers. Fittingly, he'll be celebrating the release of a split 7-inch on This Man Records with songs by Dawdy and Lydia Burrell. \nSmith basically has two music careers, each satisfying for their own reasons, but there are days when Howell can be a little annoying. That's because Smith has been working on Lydia Burrell for many years, first as a solo project where he simply played guitar over beats made on his laptop. It then grew into a band, first with Justin Schotter-Davis and Mark Guidry (currently on new-dad hiatus), the lineup that earlier this year released the very good full-length album, \"Safe.\" \nLydia Burrell songs are darker, more personal and certainly not funny — it's can be a thorny trip but the pay-off is often handsome. Smith clearly has more invested emotionally in Lydia Burrell, which he began in the late 2000s, and while he thoroughly enjoys Howell there have been some awkward moments. \n\"When my mom first heard 'Fire Extinguisher' I could see it in her face. There was the sense that I did something good,\" Smith said, laughing. \"Not that my parents haven't been very, very supportive, but they wouldn't listen to Lydia Burrell if I wasn't their son. It's just not their thing. But how simple and catchy and silly and fun 'Fire Extinguisher' is, a lot of different kinds of people seem to be into that song. \n\"There were a lot of moments like that where maybe I felt like, you know, why can't people respond to my other songs this way? I don't know that I resented the attention because I've always really enjoyed doing Howell Dawdy stuff.\" \nSmith grew up in Hanover, Indiana, where his father, Jonathan, taught English at Hanover College. The family moved to Louisville when Smith was seven after his attorney mother, Stephanie, was offered a job. He's been here since and his day job, repairing and maintaining organs for Webber & Borne Organ Builders, keeps him busy. \nSmith got heavily into music during high school, starting with mainstream hard rock before getting into Louisville's post-punk scene. He had a couple of high school bands, the most notable of which, Hotel Roy, featured Jim James on vocals. He got serious about music at Earlham College and eventually got a degree in music theory and composition from the University of Louisville. \nYou can hear that degree in Lydia Burrell's songs, which include some breathless left turns. Dawdy, meanwhile, has turned into an extension of Smith, who favors absurdist humor (his unhinged Twitter account, @LydiaBurrell , was recently voted Louisville's best by LEO readers). He briefly thought about creating an entire persona for Dawdy but instead just wings it. \n\"When I decided to keep coming up with songs, eventually he just became a guy making jokes — eventually he's just me making a series of jokes,\" Smith said. \"I haven't agonized over what his character is, or what his motivation is, because I want to leave it open to whatever I think is funny. I just think of him as being an entertainer. \n\"He's just getting up in front of people and he has stuff to say, and he thinks it's entertaining for whatever reason. You can kind of project if that's because he's an insane person, or if he's being very satirical, like, he's holding up a mirror to society, man. I'm just doing stuff that makes me laugh, and I think I would hinder that instinct if I created a huge fictional world for him.\" \nReporter Jeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160 and jpuckett@courier-journal.com. \nWHEN: 9 p.m. Friday \nWHERE: Zanzabar, 2100 S.
