The play follows them on their journey through France until finally they come face to face with the mightiest army in Europe. What happens will change their lives forever. \nThe Road to Glory is a new play by Neil Duffield, specially commissioned by The Berry Theatre to highlight the role the region and its people played in the now legendary battle of Agincourt and Henry V’s journey to war. Supported by Arts Council and Heritage Lottery Fund, the play features a cast made up of local young actors from across Hampshire and will receive its premiere at the Hedge End venue. \nDirected by Daniel Hill, it combines both fact and fantasy in a fast-paced, physical production that takes us from rural England to the bloodshed of the battle of Agincourt itself. Share article \nThe Berry Theatre in Wildern Lane, Hedge End, presents The Road to Glory on Friday, October 30 at 7.30pm and Saturday, October 31 at 2pm and 7.30pm. Tickets are £8 & £6 (concs). \nCall 023 8065 2333 or visit theberrytheatre.co.uk Promoted Stories Young actors take Road to Glory for Agincourt project Sorry, an error occurred.
