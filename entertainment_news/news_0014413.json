Bordier then watched the clip and was so surprised she investigated further. \nShe noticed from Futerman’s Facebook profile that the pair had both been born in Korea on the same date. She then decided to contact her.\n“When I got that message it was almost too crazy to not be true,” Futerman told AFP on Monday.\nThe pair soon took DNA tests, which confirmed what Futerman said they both had known immediately –- that they were sisters.\nFuterman had been adopted soon after birth by an American couple and raised in New Jersey, while Bordier had been adopted by a French couple and raised in Paris. Neither had any inkling they had any siblings, let alone an identical twin.\nView gallery Futerman had been adopted soon after birth by an American couple and raised in New Jersey, while Bor … \n- 'Mind-boggling similarity' -\n\nFuterman immediately began recording their experience on film and \"Twinsters\" captures every moment, from the sisters’ first call on Skype, to when they first meet in London and stand for a moment blinking at their mirror image in disbelief.\n“Everything was out of this world,” said Futerman. “At first it was just really awkward to finally be in the same physical space. When we met our hair was the same, our skin tone was the exact same colour, our nail polish was the same.”\nThe documentary’s heartwarming tale is expanded beyond the initial reveal as Futerman and co-director Ryan Miyamoto go on to explore wider issues the emotional reunion ignites.\nOne of those is the debate over whether personality is developed via “nature” or “nurture” and Futerman is now convinced.\nView gallery Futerman said the filmmakers had been focused on bringing \"Twinsters\" to Korea since its w … “I was always ‘nurture’ person and this really changed my mind,” said. “We are so similar it is mind boggling.”\nTogether the pair set out to trace their roots back to Korea, and the cameras follow them through their encounters with their initial foster mothers and at a convention of Korean adoptees, and through an attempt to get in touch with their birth mother.\nThe pair’s story received widespread coverage in Korea and worldwide when it broke in 2013. The project received more than $43,000 from hundreds of backers via funding platform Kickstarter.\nThe issue of adoption has long been a contentious one in the country, with estimates that around 200,000 have been sent overseas since the end of the Korean war in 1953.\nIn the end, South Korean officials interviewed for the \"Twinsters\" are unable to explain either why the twins were separated at birth, or why Bordier’s documents claim she was born in Seoul when they were both in fact born in Busan.\nFuterman said the filmmakers had been focused on bringing \"Twinsters\" to Korea since its world premiere at the South by Southwest festival in Texas in March, where it picked up a special jury award. It is expected to be shown in cinemas across Asia in early 2016.\n“There is a signification community like us in Asia and we want our film to reach out to them,” said Futerman. Bordier was unable to attend the event due to commitments in Paris.\nThe Busan festival continues until Saturday October 11.\nArts & Entertainment Media Samantha Futerman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:03:21.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
