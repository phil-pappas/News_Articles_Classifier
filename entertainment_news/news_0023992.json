It has been read by at least half a million people in the U.K. and we have received no complaints.\" \nKevin Powell, a prominent African-American activist and author, previously told WENN of the stunt: \"I think my white sisters and brothers like Meryl Streep, no matter how famous or talented, need to understand that slavery or references to slavery is not something to take lightly... \n\"While I am very much an ally to women and girls in the work for equality on all levels, I think we've got to be mindful of dissing others while calling for our own freedoms. What might be oppression to one group can easily become privilege and enthusiastic ignorance to another group.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:25:23.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
