Vin Diesel fires back at body-shamers. Picture: Getty \nKNOWN for his super-fit physique, naturally the internet went into meltdown when unflattering pictures surfaced of Vin Diesel last week. \nThe Fast and Furious actor was almost unrecognisable as he stepped out shirtless in Miami, debuting a much softer look that many fans labelled “dad bod”. \nSince then, discussion of the photos has hijacked his promotional tour for new film The Last Witch Hunter , so the 48-year-old star took to Instagram to silence his body-shamers in the best way possible. \n“It is amazing the response from the journalists who I have been talking to for the last two days in New York. Today one wanted to see the dad bod. Haha.” he vented to his 11 million followers. \n“I am wondering if I should show the picture... Body-shaming is always wrong! What do you think?” Vin Diesel \nPulling up his shirt to expose a still-there six pack, he fired back: “The pic from yesterday... For those who wanted the show... For all the angels that love dad bod regardless...I will post an exclusive video on my Facebook when I am done with press today.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:44:26.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
