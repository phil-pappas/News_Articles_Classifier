The world premiere piece for this program was Carl Schimmel’s “Roadshow for Thora,” which was musical accompaniment, largely animal sounds, to projected photos of five toys that have appeared on the PBS-TV program “Antiques Roadshow.” Another charming piece was Karim Al-Zand’s “Swimmy,” in which Texas Public Radio announcer Nathan Cone narrated the children’s book of the same name with the book’s illustrations of an adventurous fish shown on a side screen while the ensemble played fluid melodies. The concert included mystical and dreamy Trio for clarinet, violin and piano by Pierre Jalbert. The concert opened with Steve Reich’s “New York Counterpoint,” played by clarinetist Stephanie Key, all 11 of her. Actually, Key played live to accompany recordings of 10 combined pre-recorded tracks by her that combined for a rhythmic, sonic delight. It was followed by a repeat performance from 2014 of Anthony Brandt’s “Four Score,” a piece that drifted in and out of dissonance.\ndhendricks@express-news.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:36:26.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
