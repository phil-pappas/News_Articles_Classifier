Others say that this stress is preventing them from living a healthy lifestyle. As a result, an increasing number of employers (73 percent according to a recent survey) are working to implement financial wellness programs to show support, promote financial health and reduce absenteeism, high turnover and low performance rates. However, the success of these programs depends on the employer's approach, be it a short-term campaign or long-term offering. \nIn this SHRM webinar, John Wolff, co-founder and director, Major Accounts, for GuideSpark , will join Kathy Raborn, strategic director of Employee Marketing for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to consider financial wellness as \"the new normal\" and what this means for employers interested in offering a program. In addition, Wolff and Raborn will explain how employers can identify and develop a financial wellness program plus ways to ensure employees recognize its value and become actively engaged. \nHR leaders involved with compensation or benefits and interested in integrating financial wellness into the offerings are encouraged to attend.
