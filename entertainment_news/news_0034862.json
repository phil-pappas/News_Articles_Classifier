It seems like Anderson has already had some names in the list of its voice cast as Jeff Goldblum revealed recently that he would star in the untitled Wes Anderson project while also hinting at some actors who would possibly join him in the cast. During a weekly jazz show with his band in Los Angeles, Goldblum told The Nerdist that he along with Bryan Cranston , Edward Norton and Bob Balaban would lend their voice to the stop-motion animation and they're up to voice a pack of dogs. Goldblum said that the movie would be \"Japanese-inspired.\" Another source added fuel to the report, claiming that Cranston and Norton had just had dinner with Anderson and Bill Murray . However, it is unknown if Murray will join the quartet in the upcoming film. If those four actors really sign the deal, the stop-motion movie will mark the third time that Goldblum has worked with Anderson, following \" The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou \" and \" The Grand Budapest Hotel \". It will also be the third collaboration between Norton and Balaban with Anderson. Thus, it's only Cranston who has never collaborated with Anderson before. Goldblum most recently wrapped \" Independence Day: Resurgence \", which is due to arrive Stateside on June 24, 2016. As for Cranston, he will next be seen as blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo in \" Trumbo \", which is scheduled for a limited release in the U.S. on November 6. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:41:20.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
