Thanks to the improved technology; visual effects and the efficiency with which it gets portrayed on the big screen have improved considerably over the years. \nThe growth in this aspect of cinema has been evident like never before in the last 5 years and is poised to improve even further in the next decade. \nDirectors like Shankar and SS Rajamouli are trying hard to treat their audiences with visual extravaganza which in turn is showing its benefits at the box office. \nYes, visual brilliance alone could actually contribute handsomely towards the movie's box office success, for it has the power to fascinate the viewers. \nPerhaps, that's one of the reasons why filmmakers spend tons of rupees to shoot those perfect looking songs in some of the most exotic places found on planet earth. \nBut visual brilliance in cinema does not limit itself to strange looking places and VFX shots. Cinematographer plays a huge part in making the movie visually breathtaking. While some does it by bringing in exciting angles, some just collaborate well with their respective colorist to produce magic on screen. \nConsidering all these factors, we have come up with 8 Tamil films those were visually striking in the last 5 years (in the slides below): 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 1/9 I \nThis film was visually striking right from the word go and the songs managed to take that factor to a whole new level. Marvelous camera work, beautiful locations, lofty art direction and high quality make-up artists were the reasons behind the film's visual brilliance. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 2/9 Puli \nPuli was a definite visual treat as the colors used in the film was dazzling enough to make it look spectacular. Also, the VFX used in this film was of superior quality which exposed Tamil audience to never before seen characters and edifices. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 3/9 Enthiran \nThe last 45 minutes of Enthiran is enough to get this movie on this particular list. VFX used to create a large humanoid and other such characters were simply mind-blowing. Sleek visuals along with the portrayal of robots contributed towards the visual brilliance. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 4/9 Vishwaroopam \nTwo different tones were used in this movie and both were visually striking. Art director Lalgudi Ilayaraja was largely responsible in making Vishwaroopam visually enchanting. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 5/9 Billa 2 \nBilla 2 was predominantly shot in Goa and Georgia which contributed to the film's visual brilliance. The climax scene which includes the bombing of a train redefined visual brilliance in Tamil cinema. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 6/9 Kadal \nCaptured by Rajiv Menon, Kadal provided a unique visual experience which was quite striking as well. Since it exploited the beauty of nature, Mani Ratnam's Kadal was visually special too. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 7/9 Raavanan \nJust like Kadal , Raavanan too depended heavily on nature to produce magic on-screen. It did create magic alright as the movie was visually spectacular. 8 Visually Striking Tamil Movies In The Last 5 Years! 8/9 O Kadhal Kanmani \nO Kadhal Kanmani is a peculiar choice simply because this flick highlights the geniusness of PC Sreeram. The angles used in the film, especially songs, were out of this world and hence contributing towards visual brilliance.
