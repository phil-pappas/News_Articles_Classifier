That was 40 years ago. Comment By Andy SmithJournal Arts Writer Posted Oct. 4, 2015 @ 12:01 am PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- When Rich Lupo decided to open a bar in downtown Providence, he promised his mother he would only stay in the business for three years. Then he would do the right thing and go to graduate school. That was 40 years ago. Now he's celebrating the anniversary of Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, which opened Sept. 5, 1975, with a series of shows at Lupo's sister club, The Met, at 1005 Main St. in Pawtucket. The anniversary shows, a veritable Lupopalooza, will run from Oct. 7 through Oct. 11, and feature bands that were mainstays at Lupo's over the years, among them Max Creek, The Schemers, Rizzz, the Young Adults, the Wild Turkey Band, and Duke Robillard presiding over a summit meeting of the state's best blues players. (For the list of shows, see the end of this story.) Earlier this week, Lupo and Jack Reich, his longtime director of booking and promotion, met at The Met to look back over 40 years of Luponian history. \"I don't know how that could even happen, when so many clubs have come and gone in a city the size of Providence,\" Reich said. \"There was always a way to keep going,\" said Lupo. For the 40th anniversary shows, they said, the bands almost picked themselves, musicians who made Lupo's what it was back in the '70s and '80s, many of whom are still playing today. Lupo said he wanted to spread the shows over five nights at The Met, rather than having one long concert at Lupo's itself, in order to give musicians more time on stage. And The Met reminds him of the old Lupo's. \"Each night will be a party,\" he said. After 40 years, the 66-year-old Lupo said he and Reich occasionally think about retirement. But they're never quite ready. \"Jack and I always tend to think we have four years left,\" Lupo said. \"And that just keeps going on.\" In the past four decades, there have been three incarnations of Lupo's, all in downtown Providence. The legendary Lupo's I (1975-88) was at 377 Westminister St., to be replaced by Lupo's II (1993-2003) in the old Peerless Department Store at 239 Westminster, and finally Lupo's III (2003-present) in the Strand Building at 79 Washington St. The iconic Dan Gosch murals of deceased musicians — Elvis, of course, plus Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Bob Marley and more — have moved with Lupo's from place to place. The club has changed over the past 40 years. The current Lupo's, which holds up to 1,900 people, is more concert venue than bar. \"At the original Lupo's, people just showed up on a Friday night, and knew they were going to hear a good band,\" Lupo said. Along with the main club, Lupo owns The Met in Pawtucket, the descendant of yet another legendary Providence club. The current Met holds about 500, and Lupo is more comfortable there than he is at the big downtown Lupo's. \"I probably spend more of my time at The Met,\" he said. \"It's closer to the way running a club used to be for me. A little more hands on ... I'll help load the equipment, get to meet the musicians, the crew, the opening act, the bus driver.\" It was his love for music, and bars, that got Lupo into the business in the first place. Born in Massachusetts, Lupo went to Brown University, graduating in 1970 with a degree in psychology. \"The first time I went into a bar as a college freshman, I thought it was so cool,\" he said. \"I said to my classmates that I couldn't think of anything cooler than owning a bar and having Bo Diddley play there. That's always what I fantasized about.\" It took a while to turn fantasy into reality. After leaving Brown, Lupo drifted, traveling and painting houses in Providence when he needed money. He even had a stint testing dented cans at Tabby Cat Food Co. In 1974, he decided to create his bar, although it wouldn't open its doors until the following year. Lupo had $15,000 in savings, borrowed $10,000 from a friend, and took out a bank loan. He was able to get a liquor license in downtown Providence, which was essentially a wasteland after dark. It wasn't long after he opened that Lupo decided to bring in live music. In those days, Lupo said, he spent a lot of time hanging around at India Imports in downtown Providence, because it seemed as though half the musicians in the state worked there. \"I remember wondering if someday, maybe we could get Rizzz to play. And after that, maybe, just maybe, Roomful of Blues,\" Lupo said. He got Rizzz — which was managed by Jack Reich at the time — and Roomful, and much much more. \"We were probably the first band that had more than a 50-cent cover charge,\" said Klem Klimek of Rizzz (and a former stage manager at Lupo's). \"We wanted to charge $2, and Lupo was afraid he would lose his shirt ... the first Lupo's was so cozy and crazy. I played there a heckuva lot. I've probably played there more than anyone alive. There were so many great nights: John Cale, Jerry Lee Lewis. NRBQ nights were always great. Roomful nights were always great.\" Lupo's Bo Diddley dream would come true in 1977 — nine consecutive sold-out shows, with Diddley backed by the Young Adults. Tom Keegan, who played with the Wild Turkey Band, the Language, and the Hometown Rockers, spent a lot of time at the original Lupo's. \"There was a lot of energy, craziness on the dance floor. A great party vibe,\" he said. \"It was a combination of everything, the guys working the door, the bartenders, the crowd. Everybody was on the same wavelength. It was a love of music. Everyone was there because they wanted to be around music.\" Keegan remembers a Monday night when Lupo and Reich saddled him with some obscure opening act. He went into Lupo's famously grungy dressing room to work on a guitar riff, only to find someone asleep on the couch. \"I thought he looked like some burnt-out roadie.\" The next time Keegan saw the roadie, he was on stage, playing guitar. \"He was amazing. That guitar was helpless in his hands. That guitar didn't stand a chance. I thought '... who is this guy?'\" It was Stevie Ray Vaughan. Jack Reich said memories of Lupo's change from one generation to the next. The first Lupo's hosted rock and blues legends: Big Walter Horton, Muddy Waters, Son Seals, Joe Turner, Willie Dixon, James Brown, the Ramones, Roy Orbison, Iggy Pop, Talking Heads, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Feat, the Pretenders and scores more. Lupo's II had memorable shows from Dave Matthews Band, Lucinda Williams, Belly, Radiohead, the Foo Fighters, Elvis Costello and even Tony Bennett. Lupo's III has featured Wilco, Slash, the White Stripes and the Avett Brothers. Just a few weeks ago, a show by Panic! at the Disco had a line winding around the block as fans waited to get into the club. And there are still memories to be made. Reich is excited about upcoming gigs from singer Elle King and the Dave Rawlings Machine with Gillian Welch. Emerson Torrey has played at all three versions of Lupo's as a member of The Schemers and later the Raindogs. (He also helped build Lupo's II, and the current Met.) \"Rich Lupo is one of the smartest guys I've ever met when it comes to running those clubs,\" he said. \"He knows how to keep things running. He knows the numbers, and he works within the numbers to make things happen. And he loves music.\" Lupo's 40th anniversary shows Starting Wednesday, five nights of music will be held at The Met, in Hope Artiste Village, 1005 Main St., Pawtucket, to celebrate Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel’s 40th anniversary.
