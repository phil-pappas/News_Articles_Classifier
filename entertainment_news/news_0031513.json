More than two decades after he played Penguin's father in 1992's \"Batman Returns\", the actor/comedian is tapped to play the same character in season 2 of FOX's series \" Gotham \". Robin Lord Taylor who plays Oswald Cobblepot a.k.a. Penguin broke the news at New York Comic Con. \"So we're all familiar with Oswald's mother, the fabulous, fabulous Carol Kane,\" Taylor began his announcement. \"We don't know a lot about his father... We just found out that I do have a father. And he will be showing up very soon, and he will be played by none other than Paul Reubens, a.k.a. Pee-wee Herman! He's playing my dad! What! The! Hell!\" Big news: Paul Reubens will be playing Penguin's father in @Gotham . Unreal. I have the best tv parents. Legends. pic.twitter.com/45v6iiks4y — Robin Lord Taylor (@robinlordtaylor) October 11, 2015 Talking about the theme of season 2, writer John Stephens said, \"We wanted to trace the development of season 1 from old-time mobsters to trace the trajectory of the rise of the supervillains. We'll be telling one long story over the 22 episodes, so you can't miss one episode.\" Michael Chiklis , who will join the show as Jim Gordon's ( Benjamin McKenzie ) new boss Captain Nathaniel Barnes, also attended the panel. He teased his character's arrival, \"He's a real wallflower. Barnes comes in as a countermeasure to the villainy that is running amok in Gotham. He serves as a mentor to Ben's character and also he's trying to pull him out of the muck, because he's sliding down that slippery slope.\" Asked about the death of Jerome Valeska ( Cameron Monaghan ), who was believed to be the future Joker, Stephens said, \"If you watch the episodes closely, you'll start seeing seeds of that story develop. It's not the last you've seen of that character.\" \"Gotham\" airs Mondays at 8 P.M. ET on FOX. \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:47.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
