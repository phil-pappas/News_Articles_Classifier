The hip-hop star has premiered the long-awaited music video for his latest single Hotline Bling and it has quickly become a hot topic on social media. \nShot by Director X, the futuristic visuals feature the Canadian rapper showing off his moves in a white space lit up in an array of bright colours, interspersed with scenes of women seductively dancing around. Twitter has been flooded with jibes about Drake's interesting shapes, with one user joking: \"Lmao why is drake dancing like an old man,\" while another chimed in: \"I think my biggest question right now is... 'Is Drake going to put out a step by step instructional video for the Hotline Bling dance?'\" \nIn the midst of memes mocking the hip-hop star, another fan wrote: \"Drake should have got a ghostdancer,\" and another joked: \"Drake literally dances like my dad and I mean that in the best way possible. So jazzy.

Instead of having to post your stuff on these different and sometimes confusing places, it's all in one place: Connect.\" \nFans have been eagerly awaiting the release of Views From The 6 but Drake has been keeping them sweet with a whole host of new music, including the chart-topping mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late to his collaborative record with Future , What A Time To Be Alive. \nThe best reactions to Drake's Hotline Bling music video: Ya @Drake bussing them dance moves #HotlineBling ?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:00:23.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
