A number of famous faces also showed some love via Twitter. \nComedian Dara O’Briain cheered on protesters on his Twitter account. Good luck to the junior doctors marching today! \n— Dara Ó Briain (@daraobriain) October 17, 2015 \nRalf Little said a big thank you to the workforce keeping us in good health, and wished them the best of luck. Good luck on the march today junior doctors. Thanks for everything you have done, and will do, to look after us. #notsafenotfair \n— Ralf Little (@RalfLittle) October 17, 2015 \nWriter and funnyman David Schneider tweeted support for the cause, also raising the question of exactly where Hunt expected these reforms to go. Wishing all the best to the #juniordoctors demonstrating today to keep us safe and well. #bump \n— David Schneider (@davidschneider) October 17, 2015 Hunt clearly plans to replace NHS with academy/free hospitals that can use unqualified doctors.

Good luck to all marching today in London, fighting against the unsafe new #juniorcontract for #juniordoctors . \n— TAMAL RAY (@DrRayBakes) October 17, 2015 \nActivist and musician Billy Bragg chimed in with a supportive tweet for all those marching.
