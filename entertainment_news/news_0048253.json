The crazy train that is JLaw on an international press tour is back, thus guaranteeing at least a month or two of solid Jennifer Lawrence being ridiculous and awesome in equal measure moments. Don't pretend you don't love it.\nLawrence and her Hunger Games co-stars Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth sat down with MTV's Josh Horowitz in 'Camp Mockingjay' to talk 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2' to do stupid things unrelated to the film because that's how promo tours work in the 21st century and you're part of a teen franchise.\nAfter burning their hosts attempt a ghost story, the trio then play a game of 'Truth or Dare', which starts with a truth about disgusting habits (JLaw doesn't wash her hands after the bathroom apparently) and then moves onto a dare to see how marshmallows Lawrence can fit in her mouth.\nNever one to back down from a challenge, JLaw goes all in.\nCome for the mouth-stuffing, stay for the gross date story that the marshmallow stuffing reminds Lawrence of.\nVia MTV\nMORE: Watch: The latest Hunger Games: Mockingjay trailer is about as foreboding as they come\nMORE: Pic: Liam Hemsworth is bound to make ex Miley Cyrus jealous with his first Instagram post\nMORE: Watch: Johnny Depp's Dior ad for their new man scent 'Sauvage' is... interesting?", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAUO8EhsSTz02stvKDupChQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEz8Td6w8Gg?feature=player_embedded"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:02:54.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
