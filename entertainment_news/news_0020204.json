I’m singing quite high up in the chorus, I’m trying to have a Meat Loaf moment. \n“I want people to like it, I really like it and when I wrote it, I knew this would be the first thing everyone heard from me.” \nFollowing the song’s debut on the radio show, fans took to social media to praise the star. Promoted stories Adele (Ian West/PA) \nOne fan tweeted: “She’s back and amazing!”, and another said “How is it possible for ONE human to be so talented?! It’s not normal.” \nThe first lyric of the song is “Hello” and the star referenced Lionel Richie’s famous lines from his song of the same name, saying: “Me and Lionel, we definitely have got to do something. Lionel, I’m putting it out there.” \nShe said she felt relieved after the song had aired. BBC Radio 1 host Nick Grimshaw (Ray Burmiston/BBC) \n“I’ve been sitting on it for ages,” she told Nick. “I felt like a lot of stuff in my life has changed and not at all because of my career, because stuff changes. And I found myself yearning for my past for no reason other than that it had gone. \n“I missed elements of it … it’s not about an ex-relationship … it’s about my relationship with everyone that I love … it’s not that we have fallen out, we’ve all got our lives going on and I needed to write that song so they would all hear it, because I’m not in touch with them.” \nShe has confirmed November 20 as the global release date for the album. Adele in 2012 (Jonathan Short/AP) \nShe gave fans an insight into the album via Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday, three days after she had teased a snippet from a song during an ad break on ITV’s The X Factor. \nHer message said: “My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I’m making up with myself. \n“Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven’t got time to hold on to the crumbs of my past like I used to. What’s done is done.” \nReflecting back, she said she used to wish her years away. \n“When I turned 12 I just wanted to be 18. Then after that I stopped wanting to be older,” she wrote. \n“Now I’m ticking 16-24 boxes just to see if I can blag it! I feel like I’ve spent my whole life so far wishing it away. Always wishing I was older, wishing I was somewhere else … Wishing I hadn’t ruined so many good things because I was scared or bored.” Share article \nShe became a mother in October 2012, when she gave birth to son Angelo with boyfriend Simon Konecki.
