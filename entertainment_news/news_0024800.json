Heyross had a passion for music at a very young age and naturally would sing or create melodies and rap anywhere he was. Although he had a passion for music the conditions he was living under restricted him from actually doing what he always wanted to do. Living with a single mother and being the oldest of two Heyross had to work at an early age and worry about problems far beyond his years. Heyross first became serious with music in middle school where he used to make beats in his basement. Listening to Nas and Tupac accapellas Heyross would make beats and sample them. As time went on by high school him and his friends would freestyle or sing anywhere, \"there would be high school football games where we would make close to a hundred dollars just singing and rapping to girls\".\nAfter high school is when Heyross started to get more involved. Him and long time friend kelin would make songs everyday in a mutual friends garage. Over time the sound started to get more original and people started to take notice. Whether it was aggressive rap or a smooth chilling with your lady on a late night vibe Heyross was making the music you needed to hear. In 2014 Heyross got in touch with The SkreamKrew in late 2014 to produce the hit mixtape PurpleWaves and have since been working together ever since.
