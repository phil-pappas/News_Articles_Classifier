She posted a photograph of her bandaged thumb on Instagram on Saturday, reports usmagazine.com. “Band aids don’t fix kitchen knife-related injuries,” Swift, 25, wrote, referencing the lyrics from her revenge song “Bad Blood”. The photograph shows the “Wildest Dreams” singer’s left thumb in a white bandage with number 13 written with black marker. Swift has previously spoken about 13 being her lucky number, and how it’s both her birth date (December 13) and in all her social media handles. The star is an avid cook, frequently taking to social media to document her cooking adventures.
