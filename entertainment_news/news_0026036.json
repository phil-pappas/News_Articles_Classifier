It premiered to strong reviews at Frightfest 2015 in London this past September, demonstrating clear influences that range from Roman Polanski to David Lynch, mixed in with a healthy dose of what Fallon would call his own “spiritual upbringing and personal demons.” “'The Shelter' was the film that wanted to be made. The bulk of the process from script to screen was very pure,” says writer/director John Fallon.\nThe film revolves around a widower and homeless man, named Thomas Jacobs (played by Michael Paré), who finds shelter one night when he falls upon a vast two story house with the lights on and an inviting open front door. He strolls in and makes himself at home, but what at first seems like a lucky break turns out to be a cruel twist of fate when he realizes that the house won’t let him leave.\nHere are what some of the critics had to say:\n”Pare really gives it his all here, plunging to emotional depths I never thought he was able to do and doing them with a real sense of soul.” – AINT IT COOL NEWS\n“Fallon’s piece is piercing as a disconcerting family dreamscape.” – STARBURST MAGAZINE\n“There’s a confidence to Fallon’s choices too, as he gives us a not particularly likeable protagonist and maintains a somber tone throughout this emotionally raw journey.” – SCIFINOW\nFor more information on ‘The Shelter’, download the film’s Press Kit ( http://bit.ly/1GAUVkR ) or check out the film's official site ( http://www.theshelterfilm.com ).\n‘The Shelter’ will next screen at the 48th edition of the prestigious Sitges Film Festival on Friday October 9th.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5BcnJvd2ludGhlSGVhZC5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS8xR0FVVmtS", "http://bit.ly/1GAUVkR", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVzaGVsdGVyZmlsbS5jb20="], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:27:22.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
