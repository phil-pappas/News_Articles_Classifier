Oh, that's soft, man!\" the \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" host said . \nAnd then, obviously, you strap on a helmet and some pads, and you tackle it. \n\"I want you to know I played one day of high school football,\" Colbert said. \nThis robotic tackling dummy is actually called the Mobile Virtual Player, and it was developed by Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering and head football coach Buddy Teevens. It's used during practice so the players don't injure each other. \nAt least now Colbert can say with confidence he's added tackling a football dummy to his football repertoire. \nThis video includes Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:15:18.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
