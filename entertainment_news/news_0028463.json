That's it. I am not saying so because I only rap...but these guys, whoever you're saying in Bollywood, they sing four to five lines and basically say 'Oh daaru! Oh daaru!',\" Sehgal told IANS.Sehgal, who has given hits like \"Thanda thanda paani\", a brazen remake of \"Ice ice baby\" of international rapper Vanilla Ice, says repeating some lines is not rap according to him. \"They (Bollywood) have a song, then they have four to five lines mixing rap. So I do not think so rap has arrived in Bollywood. Just singing few lines like 'Oh baby! Oh whatever'... that is not rap according to me,\" he added.The rapper, who has crooned a number for an Indian animated comedy TV series for children titled \"Pakdam Pakdai\", airing on Nickelodeon's Sonic channel, says that \"it will take some time for actual rap songs to come\" in the industry.Having given comical titled tracks like \"Chicken fried rice\", \"Aloo ka parantha\" and \"Mutual fund\", the rapper believes that the digital age has given an impetus to help non-film singers get a worthy platform.\"When you talk about non-film songs, you can't do much of dance numbers. But if singers do it in movies, they get support of the films, Bollywood, actors, producers and banners... that's how those songs are promoted.\"But our songs are promoted merely on our credit and through the internet,\" said Sehgal, who was also seen in the first season of \"Bigg Boss\".Sehgal will next be seen doing a cameo in a project by Yash Raj Films titled \"Bank Chor\", which features actors Riteish Deshmukh and Vivek Oberoi.\"Im going to Baba Sehgal in that film...I have done a title song, which is a rap song,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:20:03.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
