The beautiful singer is building a brand for herself by combining her love of ‘50s pin-up fashion, fine food and wine, and a signature sound that blends blues and soul music. By spotlighting an up-and-coming artist from New Jersey, the magazine continues to show that it believes in a good story more than a big name.\n“There was a time when many publications would shine the spotlight on local artists by making them the cover story,” recalled Gary Wien, publisher of New Jersey Stage. “These days, far too many publications are worried about driving clicks to their articles to do that. They focus solely on the biggest stars, believing that they will bring the most clicks. We focus on the story.”\nThe digital magazine format is perfect for showcasing stories like this with beautiful color photos and videos that introduce the reader to what the artist actually sounds like.\n“I can’t even imagine writing about music without the use of audio or video alongside an article,” said Wien, a three-time winner of Top Music Journalist from the Asbury Music Awards. “In 2015, shouldn’t all music magazines let you hear the music?”\nNew Jersey Stage magazine combines the best features of the web (audio, video, interaction) with the look and feel of a traditional publication. Issues are available for free at www.NJArtsMag.com. Unlike many digital magazines, there is no print version. It is solely designed to be read on any PC, tablet, or smartphone without the need to scroll or zoom in. The magazine can also be downloaded and read offline.\nIn addition to the cover story on Eryn Shewell, the issue includes features on Melissa Etheridge, John Taglieri, Glen Burtnik, and Matthew J. Hockenjos who was recently named Executive Director of the Asbury Park Music Foundation.\nThe issue takes a look at the plays “Dead Man’s Cell Phone” and “The People Before The Park,” along with the monthly spotlight on theatre around the state. There is a special preview for the New Jersey Film Festival Fall 2015 season and reviews of “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” and “Mistress America.” Dance fans can see what is in store for the upcoming season by the American Repertory Ballet, while art lovers can see slide shows of work by Julio Borges and the ArtsGuild New Jersey. There’s even a look inside “The Pork Roll Cookbook” which has dozens of recipes for New Jersey’s favorite breakfast food.\nAbout New Jersey Stage\nNew Jersey Stage, a daily website (NewJerseyStage.com) and monthly digital magazine (NJArtsMag.com) covering the arts throughout the Garden State, is published by Wine Time Media.
