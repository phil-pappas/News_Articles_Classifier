It's worth a watch:\nHardy, as you'll recall, was convicted of assault last year after his girlfriend testified that he beat her up, choked her and threw her onto a couch covered in assault rifles. The charges were ultimately dropped when his accuser didn't show up for subsequent court dates, but Hardy still had to sit out the first four games of this season.\nThis weekend he returns as a Dallas Cowboy, and Hardy marked his NFL comeback by subtly reminding people that he thinks little of women. Yesterday, during a little media scrum, he said something creepy about Gisele Bundchen . Then, for some reason, a reporter informed him about that Blake Brotles' wife is a hottie and Hardy replied, \"This kind of information is important.\"\nThat would be weird and inappropriate for any football player. That it was a dude best known for kicking the shit of his girlfriend makes it worse. As Nolan puts it, \"Greg Hardy to pretend to respect women for 12 minutes, just 12 minutes and he couldn't even do that.\" But at least his boss doesn't care .", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/10/07/cowboys-woman-beating-star-creepily-calls-out-gisele-bundchen/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGrL39Q99sE", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/jerry-jones-agrees-with-greg-hardys-questionable-comments-about-tom-bradys-wife", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11220817/greg-hardy-carolina-panthers-guilty-2-counts-domestic-violence", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4aiA17YsM"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:10:40.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
