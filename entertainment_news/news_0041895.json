Shipwrecked! doesn't want to amaze us, as Metamorphoses does, with questions of \"How did they do that?\" Rather, the show wants to charm us by showing us exactly how they do do that: the metal sheets that, when rattled, sound like a storm, or costumes on hangers standing in for people. Director Jesse Bernstein has clearly had a good time giving us a good time. \nShipwrecked! is, indeed, \"An Entertainment,\" and playwright Donald Margulies counts on our imaginations to sustain the fiction. And that's exactly what the play is about: how we willingly \"suspend disbelief\" when we watch a play or read a story. That's exactly what Louis de Rougemont did in creating the wild and wondrous narrative of his adventures - did they really happen? Or did he dream them up from the tales his mother read to him? \nGreg Wood enters breathless, delighted, and eager as the old Louis. He promises to tell us a remarkable story - in 10 chapters - of his adventurous life. He will also do handstands and cartwheels and spin yarns with wide, wonder-filled blue eyes. It is a remarkable and delightful performance. \nIn 1860, Louis was a sickly child of 8 whose mother kept him indoors, but who read him adventure stories. When he was 17, he shipped out for the South Seas, and, after fabulous storms, a giant octopus, a typhoon, and a whirlpool, his ship, the Wonderworld, is wrecked, and Louis is marooned on a desert island with only Bruno, his beloved and loving dog. Playing the dog (among many other characters) is David Bradley Johnson, who completely and enchantingly embodies dogness. He also does a great Queen Victoria. Joining him on his island are three shipwrecked aborigines (we are now off the coast of Australia), among them the versatile Bi Jean Ngo, who is terrific in a variety of roles, but none more adorable than that of a giant sea turtle.\nThe genuine disaster comes not in a misadventure on the high seas, but years later, after Louis returns to his pined-for London. He becomes a celebrity by publishing his story and then discovers that fame is fleeting, that you can't go home again, that the civilized, cynical world refuses to \"suspend disbelief.\" \nBut not us, not us.
