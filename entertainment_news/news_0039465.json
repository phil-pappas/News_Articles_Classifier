The school has a large, nicely finished wooden dance floor and a great sound system. Admission is free. \nBecause of holidays, there will only be one dance in November, December and April. On many of the nights, there will be a special dance lesson prior to the open dancing. \nThe lessons will begin at 6:30 p.m., an hour before the regular 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. open dances. The current schedule of instructors and lessons is as follows: Oct. 16, Sam Bartlett, waltz; Oct. 30, Jacob Adams, East Coast Swing; Nov. 13, David Lamon, West Coast Swing; Feb. 12, David Lamon, Rumba; May 13, David Lamon, Country Two­Step; and May 27, Terence and Annette Lee, Lindy Hop. The series runs into June, and more lessons will probably be added later. \nDancers are asked to bring a change of shoes so the wonderful floor can be protected. If school is canceled because of weather, there will be no dancing that night.
