This is just a fun hookup for her. It's not like she's in love.\" \nThe duo, who first met at a party last year when they were both in different relationships, started exchanging \"flirty texts\" after being \"reintroduced\" by the blonde beauty's older brother Oliver Hudson, who is co-starring on the new series 'Scream Queens' with Nick, earlier this year, but only \"started hooking up\" after meeting at New York Fashion Week last month. \nKate also supported Nick when he performed at the music venue Terminal 5 in Manhattan on September 9. \nAn eyewitness told Us Weekly magazine: \"Kate was dancing to all of Nick's songs. She was cheering, and when Nick performed 'Jealous,' she sang all the words. Kate only took her eyes off Nick to chat with her friend.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:21:12.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
