According to the 2015 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Award winner, he expected to see some executive members of the union so he was disappointed that none of them showed up. Stonebwoy, who recently won the Best Dancehall Artist at the 2015 edition of African Muzik Magazine Awards (AFRIMMA) was speaking on Hitz FM's 'Hitz Gallery' hosted by Dr. Pounds. \nHe said he took solace in the fact that some of his fellow musicians like Sarkodie, Samini, Kwaw Kese, Yaa Pono, Jupita, and Pope Skinny were there to support him. \n“I never saw anyone from MUSIGA, all those I saw were the press and my colleagues,\" he lamented. Stonebwoy's comment is in sharp contrast to an earlier claim by MUSIGA President Bice Osei Kuffour, aka Obuor that some members of the union attended the funeral. However, the current reigning Ghana Music Awards Artiste of the Year insisted that he was aware his colleague musicians came on their own volition and were not sent by MUSIGA.“I am forever grateful for all my fellow musicians, friends, the media and everyone who made it to my late mum's funeral,\" Stonebwoy said.
