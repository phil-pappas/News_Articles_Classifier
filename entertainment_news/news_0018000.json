The joint rehearsal phase and the performance of Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony stuck in our memory and gave us the certainty today that we have found the right successor to Tugan Sokhiev.”\nTicciati will be the eighth chief conductor at the DSO, following prestigious names including Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Chailly, and Vladimir Ashkenazy. He continues with the SCO, where he has been Principal Conductor since 2009 and at Glyndebourne Festival Opera , where he was appointed Music Director last year.\ndso-berlin.de\nThe award-winning Heath Quartet, recipients of a Herald Angel at the Edinburgh International Festival and the Royal Philharmonic Society's Young Artists Award, will appear at Falkirk Town Hall on Friday October 16 at 7.30pm.
