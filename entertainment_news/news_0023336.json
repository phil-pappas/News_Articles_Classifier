Initially it is a source of entertainment for her, as well as the people who like to listen to her recount the incidents.\nHer friend, Darlene, keeps warning Edith that her fixation is going to get her into trouble. When it actually happens, Darlene abandons the usual “I told you so” routine to do everything she can to help her friend. So does Agent Wilson, who is a neighbor and friend of Edith’s son.\nThings get truly complicated when a lot of the activity swirling around Edith crosses the border into Mexico. At the same time, there are certain elements of the Mexican society that have crossed into the United States. The collision of values leaves the “life or death” fate of many lives in the hands of an unusual combination of people, including varied ethnicities, ages, and professions.\nReaders who wish to experience this captivating work can purchase “God’s Parking Lot” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
