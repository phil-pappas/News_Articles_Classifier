But the pair eventually broke up amid cheating rumours. \"I am not worried about who is participating and who is not. I am okay with anyone who enters the house. I am here to play the game and hopefully win. So, I am cool with anyone,\" Roopal told PTI before entering the Bigg Boss house. The actress is among 14 contestants participating in the latest season of 'Bigg Boss', which is being hosted by superstar Salman Khan for the sixth time.\nRoopal said she was hesitant to be a part of the show, but eventually said yes as she didn't want to lose the opportunity. \"I am excited now. But I was not sure initially. Then I thought if I chicken out now, I would lose the opportunity to experience an exciting adventure. I may not have got another opportunity to do something like this again,\" she said.\nHowever, Roopal said she has not been a follower of the reality show. \"I have just watched the first season and another one in the middle.\" The actress said her TV background will be a boon for her and help her connect with her fans as they already know her well.\n\"I may have done fictional shows but my characters were close to who I was in real-life. I think the audience already knows me. I think the audience will be able to connect with me,\" she said. When asked how long she expects to survive on the show, Roopal said, \"I have no expectations. It is all about destiny.\"\n'Bigg Boss Nau' airs everyday on Colors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:41:56.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
