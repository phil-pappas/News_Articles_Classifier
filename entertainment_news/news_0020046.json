Through her own experience as a bullied teen, Farrah explained why she has always wanted to be the “LGBT face of cinema.”\nOITNB fans might remember Farrah Krenek on the first day of season one. The 6’2” tall model/actress/activist is returning to “ Orange is the New Black ” for season 4, reportedly along with a guest spot from Britney Spears , which should air sometime in the summer of 2016. Krenek embraced the character of Farrah the Innkeeper because in her words, “it was the very first time in my life where casting and production, and everyone that surrounded me embraced me for me.”\nFarrah Krenek has an impressive resume, appearing in “Nurse Jackie” with Edie Falco, whom she adores, and movie credits with Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. She filmed “Sisters” last summer with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, an experience Krenek labeled as a “blessing.”\nAlthough Farrah is currently enjoying acting success, her journey wasn’t an easy one, which is why she jumped at the opportunity to be the ambassador for the UChic State of the Girl Series a few short months ago. The goal is to “begin a candid conversation about the state of today’s girl.”\nFlattered for the chance to inspire young women, Farrah calls upon her teen years to hopefully benefit other “androgynous-looking” females and all young women. She was labeled and often mistook as a “boy” during her most impressionable years. There weren’t characters on television or in film she could relate to. She left modeling because she didn't fit into \"that cookie-cutter mold,\"and pounded the pavement until OITNB embraced her for being herself. Krenek entered the entertainment industry to be a voice for those who have had a difficult time fitting in.\nShe is a caring and empathetic woman on a mission, yet amid her rising fame, Farrah Krenek is extremely approachable, answering young women personally on social media and through the UChic initiative. She recently spoke to college students at Kansas University, and the program will have other upcoming engagements made available soon, along with a video series and her blog.\nBorn and raised in New York, the “Orange is the New Black” actress’ message to teen girls is clear, “I am here for you. Encourage and support one another, be the most loving and kind to each other. Be part of the solution, or else you will be part of the problem.”\nFarrah Krenek ended the interview with Quote: s from Mother Teresa’s “Anyway” poem, which is her “mantra, sanity, meditation and prayer\" that she credits to living a full and good life. “Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; give the world the best you’ve got anyway.", "external_links": ["http://www.idigitaltimes.com/orange-new-black-season-4-release-date-will-britney-spears-cameo-netflix-series-481490", "https://www.netflix.com/title/70242311", "http://uchic.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:51:17.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
