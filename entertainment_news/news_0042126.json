If you think the premiere episode was too much to handle, then wait for episode two which is expected to bring in some major changes to Damon and Stefan's life. \nIn the previous episode , Ian Somerhalder's character killed Malcolm with the help of Bonnie and Lilly vows to avenge the death of one of her dear family members. Show producer Julie Plec teases that fans should worry about everyone. \n\"The question is: Now that Damon has acted out, what will Lily do to punish him? Will she punish him directly? As we've seen, Enzo made a move on her behalf to punish Caroline, so I think everybody's going to have to watch their back as we head into next week,\" she told TVLine . \nThe show jumps three years ahead and shows a wounded Stefan seeking help from his elder brother who has chosen to sleep for the next 60 years till Elena wakes up. However, the younger Salvatore force feeds blood to him and wakes him up to seek help. \nAlaric, meanwhile, gets hold of the 'red stone' which Lily has been searching frantically. It is yet not clear how the 'dangerous artefact' will play a key role for the Salvatore brothers in order to send the Heretics back to the prison world. \nThe synopsis of episode 2 Never Let Me Go reads: \nWhen an impulsive decision by Damon threatens to unravel a carefully negotiated deal between Stefan and Lily, he has no choice but to make amends with his mother before things spiral further out of control. However, Lily remains one step ahead and carries out a harsh plan that hits Damon where it hurts most. Elsewhere, after returning to Whitmore Collage, Alaric turns to Bonnie for help with a mysterious and potentially dangerous artefact he has obtained, while Matt is forced into making a risky life or death decision. Meanwhile, Caroline, who finds herself a pawn in Lily and the heretics' plan for retribution, uncovers a shocking detail about Stefan's past. \nVampire Diaries season 7 airs every Thursday on the CW network. The second episode is directed by Chris Grismer and written by Brian Young.
