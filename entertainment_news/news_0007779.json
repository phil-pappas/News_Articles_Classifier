Reason can analyze and organize, but only through intuition can the soul create, according to the author. Just as the Internet gives unlimited access to rational knowledge, the power of intuition gives unlimited access to higher self-knowledge. This book advances the power of intuition through the I Ching method and helps the reader see the soul’s perspectives and laws that pertain to all situations. Forty years ago, the author did not know about intuition or the I Ching. Getting his first psychic reading helped him to make sense of his problems. The author, Allen David Young, was elated when he heard the soul’s views and solutions. That experience marks the beginning of his passion for using intuition to heal himself and others in almost every area of life.\n“Twenty years ago, I did not know about the Internet. When I mentioned this to a friend, he asked if I was too busy to learn faster ways to learn. As with learning new, fragile and scary ways to use intuition, I have mastered the Internet and now embrace online I Ching applications. As long as you have an open mind and a desire for healing, you can join the millions who have received inspiration and answers from the ever-present soul. Throughout this book, you will see examples of questions answered by consulting the I Ching and using your intuition. While these questions were asked to address many personal, relationship, and self-healing concerns of others, they can be used and answered for your situation. The process of getting answers to these questions helps you understand the soul’s purpose as well,” said author Allen David Young.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “I Ching Wisdom from the Soul” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
