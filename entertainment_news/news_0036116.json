Wealth and fame came instantly.\nBut lottery winner Curtis Sharp 's money vanished slowly.\nAfter beating 609-million-to-1 odds to win $5 million in 1982, Sharp, an air conditioning technician from Newark , could have been on easy street for the rest of his life.\nInstead, like others treated to windfalls, he frittered away his money on lousy investments, generous handouts and luxury items he couldn't afford.\nThe man who was once the country's most famous lottery winner is now a Baptist minister living off his pension and Social Security checks in a small house in Antioch , Tenn.\n\"The money's gone,\" said Sharp, now 71. Known for his bowler hats and dapper clothes, Sharp became an overnight celebrity when he arrived to pick up his lottery winnings with both his soon-to-be ex-wife and his girlfriend.\nSoon enough, he was playing himself in lottery commercials, posing for photos with stars like Andy Warhol , Raquel Welch , Dick Gregory and Larry Hagman , and being squired around town in stretch limos.\n\"I couldn't walk down the street without people calling my name,\" he said.\nSharp's first big purchase was a 1983 Cadillac Fleetwood . \"I paid $60,000 for it,\" he recalled.\nThen came the \"small mansion\" in West Orange , N.J, and a \"lavish wedding\" to his girlfriend, a union that didn't last. \"I was living it up, traveling everywhere, buying watches, rings, clothes,\" Sharp said. \"I enjoyed it.\nHis debts escalated and his winnings, doled out over 20 years, weren't enough to cover his appetite for the good life.\nBad business deals landed him in worse trouble. Sharp learned that a tax shelter he invested in was bogus when the IRS seized his lottery checks.\n\"I bought into a lot of things that went bad,\" he said.\nBut wisely, Sharp kept his job at Bell Laboratories for eight years after winning, allowing him to retire with a pension.\nLooking back, he said he didn't know how to manage money and didn't find the right adviser to help.\n\"I was always carefree,\" Sharp said. \"A fool and his money soon shall part.\" If he had the chance to do it over, \"I wouldn't have been so easy to rush into things. I would have paid more attention to my finances.\"\nHe has advice for the newest generation of lottery winners: \"Take a vacation, go away and clear your head,\" he said. \"Get a good financial planner. Get a good lawyer.\n\"Make sure you pay tithes to your church,\" he added.\nNot that he's complaining about his losses. He said finding God has filled the gap. He preaches at a church near his home and visits prisons, where inmates usually ask about his partly charmed life.\n\"My main thing is to give them the word of God,\" Sharp said. \"It's the only thing that will last.\"\nRelated News Historic '81 lottery winner now living in mobile home Lottery winner gets help on plan to turn good fortune into lifelong prosperity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:52:24.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
