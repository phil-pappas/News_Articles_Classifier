(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\nCONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW YORK -- Annaleigh Ashford is barking up a storm: \"Hey, hey. Hey hey hey. Heeyyyy ...\"\nThis is, you see, how the Tony Award-winning actress's new character, a talking dog named Sylvia -- the title role in the A.R. Gurney play on Broadway -- expresses herself at her most visceral (and least articulate).\nSylvia is the latest in a line of juicy female roles that have showcased Ashford's comedic flair. She was a plucky British factory worker in Broadway's Kinky Boots and a ballet-obsessed eccentric in last season's revival of You Can't Take It With You (which won her the Tony). Fans of the Showtime series Masters of Sex know her as spitfire Betty, a former prostitute and part of a lesbian couple that, as the last season wrapped, was trying to have a baby -- in the mid-1960s.\nIn Sylvia , which opens Oct. 27 at the Cort Theatre, Matthew Broderick and Julie White are cast as Greg and Kate, middle-aged empty-nesters on New York's Upper West Side. Greg brings Sylvia home from Central Park one day, to Kate's chagrin. Man and dog form an unusually close bond, one that becomes both comical and poignant.\n\"By the end, there's a sense that I'm perceived as the other woman,\" says Ashford, 30, chatting before a recent preview. \"From Sylvia's point of view, this is the man I love. I treat him like my dad in a lot of ways, but he's also the great love of my life.\"\nThe role of Sylvia presents physical challenges; Ashford wears knee pads while on stage, and sees both an osteopath and a physical therapist each week. \"But the physical language is more representational of what a dog does, so that you're reminded I'm a human being,\" she says. When she enters, \"I'm leading with my head and nose instead of having my face to the ground, sniffing, because you have to see me, to see my eyes. I slide around on my knees a lot, to give the illusion\" of walking on all fours.\nAshford also adopts what she calls \"a Baywatch jog. You know how when dogs feel really good about themselves they want to show off, and they do that sassy kind of jog? I wanted to create something that represents that.\"\nThe actress had easy access to a role model: She and husband Joe Tapper, a fellow actor, have a 6-year-old Toy Australian Shepherd named Gracie, whom they \"rescued\" from a pet shop while still dating. \"We saw her and thought she was so cute...Then we came back and they told us she had a cold, and we had a bad feeling about how she was being treated. She came home with us and got over her cold.\"\nAnnaleigh Ashford plays a dog and Matthew Broderick her keeper in a new Broadway staging of 'Sylvia.' (Photo: Joan Marcus)\nAshford notes that Broderick's wife, Sarah Jessica Parker -- who played Sylvia in the original off-Broadway production, in 1995 -- \"based her Sylvia on his dog at the time they were dating. It was a Border Collie, and they're similar -- warm, expressive dogs who say a lot to you with their eyes.\"\nAfter Sylvia , now scheduled to complete its run Jan. 24, Ashford will return to Betty: Masters of Sex will begin taping its fourth season \"probably in the spring. It's been such a gift, to play this woman who has had these amazing arc. With education and opportunity, she's gone from being a hooker to being a secretary,\" for Michael Sheen's Dr. William Masters.\nAshford singles out Sarah Silverman, who plays Betty's girlfriend, Helen, and is currently winning praise for her work as a depressed wife in I Smile Back . \"She's in this beautiful dramatic film and people say it's mind-blowing, but it didn't surprise me at all. You have to be so honest in comedy.\"\nAnnaleigh Ashford plays Betty, a former prostitute and part of a lesbian couple in the '60s, in 'Masters of Sex.' (Photo: Michael Desmond, Showtime)\nAshford finds inspiration in other prominent funny women such as \"Amy Schumer, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, who are creating their shows, being producers. They're wearing the pants in their comedies. In the comedy world, there's always been one woman to five men. I think that's changing, that we're being respected more as writers and comedians.\"\nHaving written and recorded material for a cabaret act -- she'll release Lost In the Stars: Live at 54 Below on Nov. 13 -- Ashford hopes to continue honing her own creative skills while exploring new characters.\n\"I just hope to tell stories that help change people's minds about loving and accepting others,\" she says. \"And one of the best ways we can do that is through laughter.\"\nCONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1S6oBNg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6oBNg&text=Annaleigh%20Ashford%20plays%20a%20man%27s%20best%20friend%20in%20Broadway%27s%20%27Sylvia%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6oBNg&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1S6oBNg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811968280323904-XXX-Annaleigh-Ashford147.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f32e9ff68403acaf2d115efa5fb1121ff0c8d311/c=284-0-5248-3732&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811975237032498-Sylvia0072r.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52b1fd719fc0b76551ed931ddb8b5bc1965465a8/c=163-0-3114-3935&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811968280323904-XXX-Annaleigh-Ashford147.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/74e9cbd63b5b9381e6ddeaa2386e4c92a7eb1d42/c=46-0-3238-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811969825513809-XXX-masters-of-sex-ashford-5255-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff0ce310ec8948d64c9908285a1e58dba1234afb/r=333x400/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811968280323904-XXX-Annaleigh-Ashford147.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:45:36.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
