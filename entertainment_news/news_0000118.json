(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP, File) \nLONDON (AP) — British Olympic diver Tom Daley and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have announced their engagement. \nThe announcement was published in The Times newspaper Thursday, but did not disclose a date for the marriage. \nThe 41-year-old Black is a writer and producer who won an Academy Award for his screenplay for the 2008 movie “Milk” about gay activist and politician Harvey Milk. \nDaley, 21, is a former world champion who first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14 and won a bronze medal at the 2012 Games in London, and his youthful exuberance made him a fan favorite. \nHe came out as a gay man in a YouTube video nearly two years ago, announcing that he was dating a man and couldn’t be happier.
