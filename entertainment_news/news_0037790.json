Fox and Christopher Lloyd settle in at the Bendix Diner in Hasbrouck Heights as part of a Toyota commercial posted online Wednesday morning to mark Back to the Future Day .\nThe fanciful pop culture holiday commemorates the significance of Oct. 21, 2015, the date in the \"future\" that Marty McFly and Emmett \"Doc\" Brown travel to in their DeLorean time machine in the 1989 movie \"Back to the Future Part II.\"\nRELATED: Back to the Future Day: Social media celebrates Oct. 21, 2015 In the commercial, which focuses on fuel technology and the Toyota Mirai — a hydrogen fuel cell electric car — Fox and Lloyd meet Mischa Pollack, an aero-mechanical engineer. After the scene in Jersey, Pollack travels (in a Toyota, of course) to places in California including the Los Angeles setting for McFly's home and Whittier Union High — the setting for Hill Valley High — collecting garbage from trash cans to convert into fuel.\nIn talking about the fuel technology, Pollack draws a parallel to the \" Mr. Fusion home energy reactor\" seen in \"Back to the Future Part II.\" Doc Brown uses the tool to turn garbage into power for his time machine's flux capacitor.\nThe Toyota commercial, titled \"Fueled by the Future\" (Mirai means \"future\" in Japanese), starts with Pollack's narration.\nChristopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox talk technology in the Bendix Diner in Hasbrouck Heights. (Toyota/YouTube)\n \"I'm a huge 'Back to the Future' fan,\" he says, as a scene from the movie plays on his TV. \"Especially all that crazy technology. That's why I got into science and ended up getting my master's in aero-mechanical engineering.\"\nThe diner scene, in which Lloyd and Fox talk about technology in the 1989 version of 2015 vs. the actual 2015 (Lloyd says he still uses a fax machine), was teased earlier this month .\n\"So, you're like a real Doc Brown, huh?\" Lloyd says in the latest clip, shaking Pollack's hand when they meet at the Route 17 diner.\nA Facebook page for Pollack, a graduate of Stanford University, describes him as an \"actor/musician/aeromechanical engineer. He's the host of \" Go Tech Yourself ,\" a new YouTube channel for tech reviews. He's also been a host on the \" What's Trending \" YouTube show.\n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have the opportunity to work with two of my heroes on such a once-in-a-timeline project,\" Pollack wrote in a comment on the Toyota video Wednesday. \"It was a great privilege that Toyota let me (be) part of this tremendous campaign and I wish them the best of luck in moving this technology forward.\"\nAmy Kuperinsky may be reached at akuperinsky@njadvancemedia.com .

That day is here and we decided to celebrate by finding a Back to the Future DeLorean replica in Staten Island, NY. Sal Sportiello bought the car in 2006 and has made it as true to the movie as possible by buying old airplane parts and making custom pieces to create the car. Since we had access, we had to recreate one of the most famous scenes from the first movie when Marty McFly sees Doctor Emmett Brown and the DeLorean for the first time.", "external_links":
