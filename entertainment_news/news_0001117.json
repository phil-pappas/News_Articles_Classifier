Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more to help No. 14 Oklahoma State defeat Kansas 58-10 on Saturday, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during the school's homecoming festivities.\nThree people were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it.\nThe flag at Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff and Cowboys players knelt down on the field and prayed before the coin flip.\nMason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown for Oklahoma State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). Kansas (0-7, 0-4) lost its 10th straight game overall and 36th on the road.\nAssociated Press\n Kansas Jayhawks Oklahoma State Cowboys Big 12 Conference", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c14c2/turbine/ct-colleges-football-kansas-oklahoma-state-spt-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:00:11.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
