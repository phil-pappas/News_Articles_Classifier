Abrams confirmed to \"Entertainment Weekly\" that Ren is infatuated with Vader. Even Ren's own voice-changing helmet is an homage to the former big bad, “The movie explains the origins of the mask and where it’s from,\" Abrams said, \"but the design was meant to be a nod to the Vader mask.\" \nAnd this is also the first time we see what Ren is potentially capable of as a bad guy, because it looks like he has the next edition of the \"Star Wars\" new class possessed by his powers of the Dark Side. Actor Oscar Isaac, who is playing Poe Dameron, is seen screaming at Ren's hands. The second \"Force Awakens\" trailer showed Poe in captivity under the blaster of a stormtrooper -- perhaps this is what happened? \nVery little is known about Poe's character, but we do know is that he's a pilot for the resistance. And that Poe grew up with the stories of the Rebellion. At D23 we asked Isaac what it was about Dameron that appealed to him as an actor: Oscar Isaac D23 Interview Reporter Meredith Woerner interviews Oscar Isaac on his roll in Star Wars: The Force Awakens at D23 in Anaheim Saturday August 15, 2015.

See more videos \n\"I liked that it was someone that had grown up with the same stories that we’ve all grown up with [from] the original films,\" Isaacs said. \"And so playing somebody that’s wanting to live up to those heroes from the past. I thought that was a really fun thing to play.\" \nIn the trailer, Rey asks Harrison Ford, who plays long-time Jedi cynic Han Solo, about, \"Those stories about what happened --\" \nHan responds, \"It's true, all of it.\" Looks like somebody finally found faith in the Force. \nAlso this implies that Poe Dameron wasn't the only character to grow up on the stories of the Rebellion. But if Rey doesn't know that these stories are actually fact, we can only wonder how outlandish the stories of Luke, Leia and Han might seem to someone 30 years later (when \"The Force Awakens\" is set). Especially when Han has to actually say in this trailer, \"The Jedi, they're real.\" People still don't know the Jedi are real? \nThe rest of the trailer cuts from one firefight between the Resistance and the First Order to another on a woodsy location. \nAlso seen briefly on a similar landscape was Solo taking Finn and Rey into what fans are speculating is the Great Temple on the Moon of Yavin IV -- t he very same rebel base that launched the first assault on the Death Star in \"A New Hope.\" \nSure, the only thing the fans have to go on is the architecture, but if Abrams is attempting to bridge the worlds of \"Star Wars\" past and present, what better way than by returning to where it all started for the Rebel scum? \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" fight Disney \nA firefight in the sky on \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" \nA firefight in the sky on \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" (Disney) \nMeanwhile, possibly on that same forest-covered planet, Poe Dameron and Finn share a truly odd glance with one another.

We don't know. But it's a tender moment tinged with actress Carrie Fisher's tears.

(Disney) \nThe shot Disney released of BB-8 could easily have been lumped into the woods firefight, but if you look closely you can see that this droid is fighting a snowy battle. Perhaps this is on the Starkiller Base which Star Wars.com's database describes as \"an ice planet converted into a stronghold of the First Order and armed with a fiercely destructive new weapon capable of destroying entire star systems.\" That quite possibly could be the hulking Death Star-looking orb seen in the recently released poster. BB-8 from \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" Disney \nBB-8 pops up in \"Force Awakens.\" \nBB-8 pops up in \"Force Awakens.\" (Disney) \nBut after all the bombastic explosions and burning planets, the trailer ends on the Force. A helmet-free Kylo Ren flicks on his crossguard lightsaber against Finn, wielding a lightsaber of his own (well actually, we now know that's not Finn's lightsaber but the lost weapon of Luke Skywalker , who is questionably absent from this footage reveal. But Hamill's voiceover was present in the first \"Force Awakens\" trailer, so cool your jets). \nEasily the best part of this interaction between Finn and Ren is that Finn doesn't really seem to be prepared for this at all: his mouth just drops open before the clip cuts away. Interesting. \nThe whole thing ends with another mysterious voice request, \"The Force, it's calling to you. Just let it in.\" \nEnd scene. \nFor a video that is created to churn up interest in a film, \"The Force Awakens\" trailer is astoundingly devoid of plot details. But let's be real, does \"Star Wars\" even really need to market to fans at this point? And isn't some of the fun going through with the rest of the rabid masses and tryingt to pick up on what Abrams is setting up? The notoriously secretive director wants to keep his Force secrets exactly that, a secret. So be certain that each second of this trailer was scrutinized for spoilers, and possibly even intentionally threaded with a few bread crumbs for the die hards. \nBut no real details will be revealed until opening day, Dec. 18. Here's hoping you already got tickets.
