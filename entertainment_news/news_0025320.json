Building on the company's regional sponsorship of the Chicago Architecture Biennial (CAB) and the \" Wright Now @ SC Johnson \" program, these evening tours continue the company's long-standing efforts to honor and support the legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright – one of America's most innovative architects.\nThe \"Wright @ Night\" evening tours are offered on Thursday evenings. Complimentary motorcoach transportation is provided, departing from the Chicago Cultural Center at 3:00 p.m. CT and returning at approximately 11 p.m. CT for evening tours. Daytime tours depart the Chicago Cultural Center at 10 a.m. CT Thursdays through Sundays throughout the Chicago Biennial.

The Administration Building and Research Tower are featured at the center of the company's global headquarters. Both buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAmong the special sights that evening visitors will enjoy:\nThe Administration Building, with its 43 miles of Pyrex glass tubing outlining its remarkable shape in the night. The Research Tower, one of the tallest structures ever built on the cantilever principle, set aglow by the internal lighting system that was restored to Wright's original vision in 2014. The remarkable Great Workroom, which is still actively in use today, its nighttime stillness making it even more like the \"cathedral\" Wright famously compared it to. The Foster + Partners-designed Fortaleza Hall, lit up by the Spirit of Carnaúba S-38 amphibian airplane soaring at its heart. On the Tour\nVisitors to SC Johnson's global headquarters see:\nThe Administration Building, Wright's first design for the company's headquarters opened in 1939. The building features more than one-half acre of open workspace in the Great Workroom and circular bird-cage elevators. The Research Tower, a 15-story architectural masterpiece where many of the company's best-known products, including Raid®, Glade®, OFF!® and Pledge®, were invented. The Tower recently went through a 12-month interior and exterior renovation, reopening to the public only last year. The award-winning Fortaleza Hall, a contemporary partner to the innovative buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright , designed by Wright-enthusiast Norman Foster of Foster + Partners. Opened in 2010, Fortaleza Hall was named for the Brazilian city at the heart of two life-changing expeditions by the Johnson family. Also, featured prominently in the building is the Spirit of Carnaúba, the airplane at the center of Carnaúba: A Son's Memoir . The SC Johnson Gallery: At Home with Frank Lloyd Wright , which currently features the Wasmuth Portfolio. The 105-year-old Portfolio – hailed as one of the most important publications of the early modern architectural movement that also established Wright as the international icon he is today – offers a one-of-a-kind view of nearly 50 rarely seen framed lithographs and treasured artifacts of Wright's most famous works. The Lily Pad Gift Shop , a unique shop that features exclusive SC Johnson memorabilia and brand gift merchandise, as well as Frank Lloyd Wright -inspired items. * No tours will be offered on Thanksgiving , Christmas Eve , Christmas Day or New Year's Eve .\n**The Research Tower is accessible only via stairs.\nAbout SC Johnson\nSC Johnson is a family company dedicated to innovative, high-quality products, excellence in the workplace and a long-term commitment to the environment and the communities in which it operates.

The Chicago Architecture Biennial will expand the spirit and scope of this event. It will invite both emerging and established practices from across the world to Chicago to demonstrate how groundbreaking advances in architectural design are tackling the most pressing issues of today. In this way it will enrich Chicago's unique role in history as a crucible of architectural innovation. The setting for a succession of pivotal episodes in modern architecture and urbanism, and a context in which architects such as Louis Sullivan , Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe developed revolutionary projects, Chicago will operate as a nexus for the ideas and practices that are driving global architectural culture in the 21st century. www.chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/see-wright-in-a-new-light-first-ever-free-evening-tours-showcase-sc-johnsons-frank-lloyd-wright-designed-headquarters-at-night-300163222.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
