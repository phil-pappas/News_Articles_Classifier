It's the latest in a string of recent accidents and injuries. \nFallon was celebrating at an event in his honor, having received the Harvard Lampoon's Elmer Award for Excellence in Humor, when he tripped over a woman who had bent down in front of him as he was turning around. Fallon fell onto broken glass, a Fallon spokeswoman said.

He checked out soon after and returned to the party. \nOne person in attendance, Ryan Schuster, posted a video to Instagram and YouTube showing Fallon, who was holding a bottle, taking the tumble. \nOn Sunday, the comedian posted a shot of his hand to Instagram. \"Nothing that a few band aids couldn't fix,\" he wrote. \nIn June, Fallon nearly lost a finger on his left hand following a freak accident in his kitchen. The injury required a six-hour micro-surgery and put Fallon in the ICU for 10 days. \nThen in August, Fallon posted a photo of himself with a chipped tooth caused when he tried to open a tube of scar tissue repair gel for his injured finger. \n\"Thank you Dr. Jobe DDS!\" Fallon wrote as the photo's caption in August.\" #BestSummerEver.\" \n-- CNN's Henry Hanks contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
