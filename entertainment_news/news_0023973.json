I grew up in Gloucestershire, and there's a certain format that people fit into. I'm actually quite happy with the format. I'm quite happy to say, ‘Go to school, work hard on your GCSEs, do your A-Levels, get married, have children. Send your kids to a nice school. Make sure you're in the right catchment area,'\" she continued. \nImage Courtesy of Paola Kudacki for Paper Magazine \nThe singer is gracing the cover in a bodybuilder pose wearing an American Apparel bodysuit and Vivienne Westwood shoes. \nComing to the successful singer, Taylor Swift who with her girls squad and friends in the music industry is winning more hearts, FKA twigs revealed she loves them all but doesn't want to be in the squad. Tay Tay is known for her friendships, socially active profiles and interactions with fans. \n\"I think Taylor Swift is great, but I wouldn't necessarily think, ‘Oh my god, I have to be friends with her,'\" twigs explained. \n\"When I meet fans, they're quite creative and intelligent, kind, sensitive. Some are old ladies, witch doctors from Louisiana, kids that have just left art school. Gay or lesbian couples, straight middle-aged couples,\" she explained. \nPaper magazine's \"Nowstalgia\" issue hits newsstands on Oct. 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:20:57.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
