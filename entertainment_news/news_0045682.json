Code L! Code L!\" The kids got up from their desks and hid in their cubbies. The teacher locked the door and demanded complete silence.\nMy kids have been doing these drills since preschool. They talk about them in animated, but not necessarily traumatized, tones.\nMy son used to think it was hilarious to cram himself into a large bathroom with his 19 preschool classmates, plus three teachers.\nMy daughter's favorite lockdowns were in first grade, because they could hide in a soundproof room off their main classroom, which meant their teacher could very quietly read to them to calm their nerves.\n\"Our door isn't soundproof this year,\" my daughter tells me. \"So we have to be silent, so the gunman can't hear us.\"\nPhoto gallery: At least nine people were killed in a shooting Oct. 1, 2015, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon.\nThis is madness. Unacceptable, and yet completely accepted, madness.\nMy children are lucky. I am lucky. We are a family who has been spared from gun violence. We are surrounded by it daily in our city and almost monthly in our nation's schools, but my children have not been shot.\nFar, far too many have. One murdered child would have been too many. We've reached the hundreds .\nNot a single morning goes by that I don't drop my son and daughter at school and wonder for a split second — that's all I allow myself — whether they will be murdered by a gunman that day.\nI know I'm not the only parent who does that.\nWe have become like the sea turtles who entwine pollutants into their nests — accepting and weaving deadly trash into the most sacred parts of our lives.\n\"Somehow this has become routine,\" President Barack Obama said Thursday. \"The conversation in the aftermath of it — we've become numb to this.\"\nOregon gunman was kicked out of Army, studied mass shooters Tribune wire reports The 26-year-old gunman who opened fire on fellow students in his community college English class, killing nine people, was an Army boot camp dropout who studied mass shooters before becoming one himself.\nA day after the rampage in this Oregon timber town, authorities said Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer...\nThe 26-year-old gunman who opened fire on fellow students in his community college English class, killing nine people, was an Army boot camp dropout who studied mass shooters before becoming one himself.\nA day after the rampage in this Oregon timber town, authorities said Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer...\n(Tribune wire reports) He's exactly right, of course. And that's shameful.\nEven worse, though, is that our children don't know any different. At 6 and 9, my kids haven't known a school year without lockdowns, and they likely never will.\nThey know gunmen routinely open fire on classrooms, and they know students routinely die.\nAnd they know all we're doing about it is teaching them where to hide.\nThat fills me with more shame and sorrow than I know what to do with.\nAnd I'm one of the lucky parents.\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/12/sandy_hook_a_chart_of_all_196_fatal_school_shootings_since_1980_map.html", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ed9ed/turbine/ct-oregon-umpqua-community-college-shooting-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560edc51/turbine/ct-oregon-college-shooting-photos-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ed8dd/turbine/chi-oregon-wre0031452124-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ed988/turbine/chi-oregon-wre0031453632-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ea9b4/turbine/ct-oregon-shooting-school-lockdowns-balancing-1002-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:15:33.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
