After it airs, fans will be able to purchase tickets to the film's December 18 movie theater opening. \nTwo, short teasers have been released, but Disney promised an \"exclusive\" look at the new film Monday night. A Spanish-language version of the trailer will air on ESPN Deportes. \nIt's the first movie addition to the Star Wars franchise in a decade.
