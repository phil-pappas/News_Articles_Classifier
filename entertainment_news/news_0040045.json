Will the TV show “Aquarius” be back? I really like it, and it hasn’t been on for a few weeks now. \nA. The first season of the NBC period drama starring David Duchovny consisted of 12 episodes that aired from May to August; it also was released digitally in its entirety shortly after its premiere. The network was especially happy with the show’s online audience and so has ordered a second season. I’d look for that in the spring or summer of 2016. \nSince you mentioned missing the show lately, it’s worth reminding everyone that networks often order shows that are intended to run mainly in the summer, such as ABC’s “Mistresses” and CBS’ “Zoo.” Both of those shows also have been renewed for another season. And speaking of “Zoo”: \nQ. Normally, I tape “Zoo.” If Episode 12 was right after Episode 11, it did not tape. I have gone everywhere to try to see Episode 12, but it is simply not available. Xfinity lists Episode 11 and Episode 13. Episode 11 does not include 12. I did watch Episode 13 and was very confused since it was at some future date. \nA. Episode 12, titled “Wild Things,” aired Sept. 8 immediately after the 11th episode, “Eats, Shoots and Leaves.” CBS billed the two telecasts as “a special two-hour episode,” but that doubling-up may have caused some confusion. \nAmazon.com, which makes “Zoo” episodes available for a fee, treats the two Sept. 8 telecasts as a single, 11th episode, with the season finale listed as the 12th. The two telecasts also are listed as a single show on iTunes. On the other hand, subscription streaming service Netflix lists the episodes separately, for a 13-episode season. \nThe On Demand channel on Time Warner, at least, had both Sept. 8 telecasts as a single item when I checked Oct. 6. CBS also has been pushing a subscription-based app, All Access, but a CBS rep said the episode is not on it. Still, if all else fails, the first season also will be on DVD and Blu-ray Dec. 1. \nQ. When is the former CBS show “Unforgettable” going to debut on A&E? \nA. The drama starring Poppy Montgomery will begin its fourth season Nov. 13. Two episodes will air that night. Montgomery returns as Carrie Wells, the detective with the phenomenal memory; Dylan Walsh also is back as her partner, Al Burns. \nBut the series, which repeatedly has changed its supporting cast, has a new one now that the show has moved from CBS to A&E. James Hiroyuki Liao returns as Major Crimes team member Jay Lee. Newcomers include Alani “La La” Anthony as medical examiner Delina Michaels, Kathy Najimy as Capt. Sandra Russo, the team’s new boss, and E.J. Bonilla as Detective Denny Padilla, who is attracted to Carrie. Look also for guest star Skeet Ulrich as Carrie’s mysterious, long-lost husband Eddie Martin, and appearances by Rachel Dratch and Ashanti. \nQ. I saw a TV-movie in the early ’80s starring Bette Davis as a woman giving flying lessons in a biplane. I don’t know the name of the movie or who else was in it. Is it possible to get a DVD of it? \nA. The movie, from 1980, was called “Skyward.” Ron Howard directed. I do not know of an authorized release on disc. There are a couple of posts of it on YouTube. And Howard tells a good story about working with Davis in an interview for the Archive of American Television. You can find that at www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/skyward. \nQ. A few years ago, I saw a movie on cable titled “Reunion.” It starred Jason Robards, Christien Anhalt and Samuel West. An alternate title is “L’ami Retrouve.” I found the DVD on Amazon, but it is available only in European format. Any chance that the film is available anywhere in U.S. format? \nA. Unfortunately, the only authorized version I know of on disc is in the European format. \nDo you have a question or comment for the mailbag? Write to the Akron Beacon Journal, 44 E.
