Awkward....\nIt seems they ended up telling the people who were the most busy as they knew they wouldn't come if they thought it was a simple birthday party. However, Theroux told Ellen; \"Afterwards we kind of realised it was a terrible plan. You're basically telling half your guests, 'You're unemployed and we can't trust you,' which is of course not the case\".\nWatch his chat with Ellen below where he also tells her how much he enjoys calling Jennifer Aniston his wife (n'aww), and then plays with a mannequin lookalike of her... okay yeah, that last part sounds weird.\nMORE: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have FINALLY gotten married\nMORE: Watch: Justin Theroux says Jimmy Kimmel cried while officiating wedding to Jennifer Aniston\nMORE: Watch: Corden opens show with tribute to Oregon victims, Obama says 'We're becoming numb to this'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:45:04.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
