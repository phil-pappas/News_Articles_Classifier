Hashim Ansari, who has been fighting the Babri Masjid- Ram Janmabhoomi case since 1959, asked Narendra Modi government to ban cow beef in the country and said that the issue is sensitive and shouldn’t be politicised. Talking about Narendra Modi, Hashim Ansari said that Prime Minister is doing good work. Narenrda Modi wants to maintain peace in the country, hence he is controlling fringe elements in his own party. Hashim Ansari criticised Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and said that he never fulfil his promises. Muslims have understood the double-standard of Mulayam Singh and would not back him now onwards. Ansari added that Yadav has no other option left than to join hands with Modi. The 95-years old also slammed Azam Khan, minister in Uttar Pradesh government, for spreading communal hatred in society. Azam Khan with his controversial statements dividing communities on religious ground, said Ansari.
