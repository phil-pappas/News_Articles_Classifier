The show will debut on October 5 th at 6:00pm ET on SiriusXM's Insight channel 121.\nThe one-hour weekly program will feature renowned media commentator Bill Carter sitting down for one hour interviews with major names in entertainment, current events, and beyond. Promising to offer insightful conversations with national newsmakers, the former New York Times reporter will launch his show with two of the biggest stars in late night: Jimmy Kimmel , followed by Jimmy Fallon in week two.\nIn the premiere, Kimmel shared that his wife Molly was actually the one to create his popular celebrities reading \"Mean Tweets\" segment; that his recent weight loss is the result of not eating two days per week; and that despite his love of David Letterman , he never thought he'd end up a talk show host. Highlights from his prerecorded interview are below, as well as audio clips.\nKimmel's wife Molly came up with the idea for \"Mean Tweets\":\n\"Mean Tweets was my wife's idea. We were sitting at the dining room table and our mutual friend Kelly Oxford , who is very popular on Twitter, was there and she was kind of going through her Twitter feed and reading some horrible things people were saying about her and to her. And I was like, 'That's nothing. Listen to this!' And I started going through mine, and Molly said 'Oh, this needs to be on the show. We have to have people read their own mean tweets out loud.' And that's really how it happened.\"\nAUDIO: http://bit.ly/1WyF2V6\nWhy Kimmel doesn't eat for two days per week to stay in shape:\n\"It is true, I did it yesterday. Two days a week I eat nothing. That's my diet plan. Yesterday was one of those days, and this morning I had two breakfasts [laughter]….My parents do it. I watched a documentary on the BBC about fasting and how it extends your life and gives your brain cells a chance to heal, or something, some bullshit, but I read it and it seemed to be reasonable. And I tried it. Really, when you think about it, you're really just cutting 5,000 calories out of your diet every week and that's probably why it works.\"\nAUDIO: http://bit.ly/1L4pUex\nBeing a teenage David Letterman fan did not mean that Kimmel wanted to be a talk show host:\n\"No, I just loved the show. I was a fan. The same way that somebody would have a poster of Andy Gibb , it's not like they're like 'I'm going to be a singer.' Girls are like 'No, I want to have sex with Andy Gibb .' I just want to have sex with Dave. [laughter] I just love Dave and I thought maybe one day it would be great if we could hang out. I ran that idea by him the first time I was on the show and he shot that right down. That's not going to happen.\"\nAUDIO: http://bit.ly/1JD74pl\nCarter, who expertly covered the television beat at the New York Times for more than 25 years, is one of the most respected journalists in the media industry and was recently named a CNN contributor. He is also the author of four books, including The Late Shift , a cultural smash that centered on the Letterman-Leno \"late night war\" to succeed Johnny Carson as host of \"The Tonight Show.\" The book was later adapted into an Emmy Award-nominated film by HBO, also written by Carter.\n\"The Bill Carter Interview\" will air on SiriusXM Insight Ch. 121.
