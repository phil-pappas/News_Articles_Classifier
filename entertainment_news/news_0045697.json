Now it is fully open to the public. The company is looking to fill a consumer demanded niche that is so heavily lacking in the community, eyebrow threading. Current options of hair removal in Sacramento are geared towards waxing, sugaring and plucking. The methods suggested do get the job of removing hair done, but are often not very accurate in areas where you would like to keep some hair (i.e. the eyebrows) and often leave noticeable marks and rashes. Hollywood Beauty offers eyebrow threading that is fast, accurate, and will leave skin without any noticeable marks.\nThe owner of Hollywood Beauty, Bidhya Adhikari had this to say about the company's launch:\nI have been fortunate to have had my eyebrows threaded since a young age by family and friends who had the skill passed on to them from prior generations. As I grew older I always would notice my friends and peers getting their hair removed through waxing and sugars. I saw firsthand the complaints and lack of alternatives in the Sacramento area, this is why I have started Hollywood Beauty. The company boasts experienced stylists in hair threading who are comfortable with men and women. Eyebrow threading stylist, Noma Adhikari has over 10 years of experience in the industry. We look forward to offering the community great service. On a business standpoint we expect to see rapid growth during the first year as we disturb the hair removal market. We are expecting to see hundreds if not thousands of customers from our competition flock to our more skin friendly alternative.\nHollywood Beauty goes beyond just eyebrow threading, offering customers threading in multiple parts of the body. Customers can get their eyebrows, chin, neck, upper lip, cheeks, forehead, and underarms threaded. Eyebrow threading will be done to get rid of unwanted and excess hair, leaving customers with crisp eyebrows that look well maintained. Alternatively Hollywood Beauty offers special discount packages to get full face threading done. Unlike waxing and sugars that use chemicals that are rough on skin and make hair grow back thicker, eyebrow threading is natural and will slow down hair growth over time, leaving customers to have less visits and saving more money.\n# # #\nIf you would like more information about Hollywood Beauty or the services offered, please contact Bidhya Adhikari at 916-696-2958. email at hollywoodbeautysacramento(at)gmail(dot)com or checkout the companies Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/hollywoodbeautysacramento .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/HOLLYWOOD-BEAUTY/NOW-OPEN/prweb12997240.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/HOLLYWOOD-BEAUTY/NOW-OPEN/prweb12997240.htm", "https://www.facebook.com/hollywoodbeautysacramento"], "published": "2015-10-03T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:30:55.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
