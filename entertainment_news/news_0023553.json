Known for writing socially-relevant songs that are both catchy and anthemic, Gloc-9 was in his element. Even celebrities who watched the show – including the Eigenmanns Andi, Geoff and Gabby; as well as Robin Padilla and Sid Lucero – cheered Gloc-9 on.\nSome of the highlights involved collaborations: Gloc-9 with Marc Abaya on “Tsinelas Sa Putikan;” with Kylie Padilla on “Walang Natira;” and Glaiza de Castro and Jennylyn Mercado on “Upuan” and “Hari Ng Tondo,” respectively.\nGloc-9 shared the story behind “Magda,” one of his most recent hits. A song about a prostitute, the rapper remarked, “Hindi ko kasi lubos na maisip na ang isang babaeng may tatay ay mapupunta sa trabahong ganoon.”\nA personal favorite is Gloc-9 and Maya’s duet of Wiz Khalifa’s “See You Again,” a tribute to the late Paul Walker, which was used in the hit movie franchise “Fast and Furious 7.” Rapper and singer delivered the song in such clear voices and sincerity that one can’t help but be touched.\nJennylyn Mercado and Gloc 9\nIndeed, the combo of stories and songs were perfect for that fun night out. The crowd was all for it and no surprise there – the emcee is master storyteller above all. It was a trip down memory lane mostly, all the way to the encore wherein Gloc-9 rendered Francis’ “Kaleidoscope World” as photos of the latter flashed on LED screen. The star of the show asked for the lights to be turned off, and for the audience to hold up their cellphones with flashlights on as he sang. The effect was just wow.\nPahabol: People also enjoyed Gloc-9’s performance of “Simpleng Tao” (his first big hit) and “Sirena” (about gay people) primarily because the rapper interacted with the audience during these numbers, getting off stage to let fans take selfies with him.\n“Gloc-9: Ang Kwento Ng Makata” continues its run on Oct. 17, 24 and 31 in the same venue.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:08:03.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
