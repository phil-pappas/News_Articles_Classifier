When a fan asked about one actor or actress he would love to work with, Akshay replied: “It was great working with Mr. Sylvester Stallone, as an actor I’d be greedy & want that opportunity again.” Stallone made a cameo appearance in “Kambakkht Ishq”, which was directed by Sabbir Khan and starred Kareena Kapoor alongside Akshay.
