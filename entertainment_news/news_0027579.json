(Photo: Hulu/NBC) \nThings are looking up for Adele fans: We have an Adele single out now, an Adele album out Nov. 20 and a just-announced Adele performance on Saturday Night Live Nov. 21 (with host Matthew McConaughey). Very happy to announce that @McConaughey will host #SNL November 21 with musical guest @Adele ! pic.twitter.com/2wAjifHjKa â€” Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) October 26, 2015 \nIf this forthcoming SNL is anything like Adele's first appearance in 2008, we know it will be epic. Here's what happened last time: It was the highest-rated episode in 14 years \nSarah Palin, left, and Lorne Michaels watch a monitor on which Tina Fey appears in a sketch as Palin on the Oct. 18, 2008 episode of 'SNL.' (Photo: Dana Edelson, NBC) \nSure, that had a lot to do with a Sarah Palin/Tina Fey appearance and funny performances by then-cast members Bill Hader, Amy Poehler, Seth Meyers, Will Forte and Andy Samberg. But Adele sure didn't hurt the show. She did an acoustic performance of Chasing Pavements , and it was amazing \nUnfortunately, we couldn't recover a clip of her as SNL 's musical guest, but trust us: She rocked. In the video above, Adele performs the same song for Letterman , so you can get an idea of how the SNL performance went. She also sang Cold Shoulder on SNL , another song from 19. Remember, this was before record-breaking album 21 was out! Her album 19 rose to the top of the iTunes chart right after \nBefore appearing on SNL, Adele's debut album wasn't yet a hit in the U.S. The day after Adele's performance, 19 took the top spot on the iTunes chart and single Chasing Pavements climbed the Billboard chart from No. 46 to No. 11. There were flip phones \nWill Forte and Bill Hader in a 2008 'SNL' sketch. Adele was the musical guest for this episode. (Photo: Hulu/NBC) \nIt's just funny to note that the episode-- like Adele's new video for Hello -- featured flip phones. We can't wait for Nov. 21! \nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1N2ULcB Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:47:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
