Neiman Marcus' 89th annual Christmas Book is not for you THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   06, 2015 - 4:32 pmLast Updated: October 06, 2015 - 4:32 pm   \nSubjects: \nNew York (1742) \n\nNEW YORK — Out of ideas for the perfect six-figure gift? Then today (even more than most other days) is your day with the arrival of the 89th annual Neiman Marcus Christmas Book. The catalog may prove to be wistful window shopping for 99 percent of shoppers, but for the remainder, you may find just the thing you didn't know you had to have. \nHere's a look at some of the stocking stuffers from Neiman Marcus: \nWHOA ... SHRED THIS RIDE WITH KEANU REEVES \nWant to give the motorcycle enthusiast in your life a set of limited edition wheels and a trip down the California coast with Keanu Reeves? The Arch Motorcyle & Ride Experience can be yours for $150,000. The package for two includes a limited edition KRGT-1 (steel and aircraft-grade billet aluminum frame with a 124-cubic-inch v-twin engine that produces 121 horsepower and matching 120 pound-feet of torque) and a two-day ride in the company of company owners Keanu Reeves and some other guy. \nWHISKEY A GO GO \nThe perfect grab bag for a close circle of five whiskey-loving buds with a spending limit of $25,000 each. For $125,000, The Orphan Barrel Project puts you and your pals in the driver's seat (not literally!) at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky. There, you'll go \"barrel hunting\" for bourbons recently discovered at old rickhouses and distilleries. And you get 24 bottles of eight different Orphan Barrel bourbons, never to be tasted again, including two variants you and your tight circle dreamed up during your spirited tour. \nWILD HORSES \nHave you seen the 2015 Neiman Marcus limited-edition Mustang Convertible? No? Well, $95,000 gets you in it with people looking at you as you look over its steering wheel and feel the 700-horsepower supercharged engine under the hood of this TG40 heritage road demon. Does going from 0-60 in 3.5 seconds intimidate you? Have no fear. The sparkly bow on this gearhead bling is a Ford racing school course. Oh, yeah. \nNOT YOUR EVERY DAY DIARY \nOh, what to get for the couture fashionista with a passion for journaling. Neiman Marcus makes that yesterday's dilemma with the $10,000 Couture Diary. Artist Abigail Vogel (of the Vogel Bindery in East Hampton) will hand paint 20 ensembles from the gift's recipient. The hand-bound book will include 60 custom-made sheets of calfskin. The artist's husband, Paul Vogel, will bind this personal tome in red or black Scandinavian calfskin and really make it personal using hand-tooled 24-karat gold. \nSUPERCHARGE YOUR CHILD'S IMAGINATION \nIs your child/grandchild a superhero or princess at heart, but needs to up their dress-up game? Bless their heart, but also get them the boys or girls MacKenzie-Childs trunk, filled with a selection of the Chasing Fireflies Ultimate Collection costumes. The \"Blue\" version gets you superheroes, the \"Pink\" gets you Elsa, Aurora, Cinderella, and all sorts of ball-gowny stuff. Or mix it up ... the pinks and blues, boys and girls. It's $5,000. You can do whatever you want. Each trunk comes with hand-painted initials of the lucky cherub. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:59:07.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
