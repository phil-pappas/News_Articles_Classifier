Founded by Hugh Hefner and famed for its bunny girls, Playboy is now aiming to become more accessible as it enters its 63rd year.\nThe American edition, which has featured stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Dolly Parton and Madonna, now operates at a loss, chief executive Scott Flanders said. Global copies still bring in a profit.\nPlayboy's chief content officer Cory Jones told the New York Times the time was right for a move away from nudity, although women posing provocatively will still feature.\n\"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passe at this juncture,\" he said.\nHefner in his famous red smoking jacket with two Playboy bunnies\nHe added: \"Don't get me wrong. Twelve-year-old me is very disappointed in current me. But it's the right thing to do.\"\nHefner, 89, reportedly agreed to the change proposed by Mr Jones last month.\nWhen he created Playboy in 1953, Hefner wrote that the magazine and its content would appeal to men aged 18 to 80.\nThe Playboy brand has been \"a tastemaker, an arbiter of style and a vanguard for political, sexual and economic freedom\", according to its website.\nThe bunny ears logo is as famous as the Nike tick and the McDonald's golden arches, it claims.\nOther editorial changes in the Playboy rebrand include a \"sex-positive female\" writing a sex column, art and more coverage of alcoholic drinks.\nIn 2010 it introduced \"The Smoking Jacket\", a safe-for-work website designed to appeal to young men, who could avoid nude images or key words which would cause the site to be blocked in a workplace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:14:38.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
