The French have a strong relationship with perfume--for us, it's just like any other beauty item we must wear every day to feel confident and to express our personality. Evidence shows that fragrance can enhance your mood by reminding you of things you love, so it may be smart to step up your spritzing.\nFind your \"Signature\" scent.\nWhen you are a teenager, fragrance becomes glamorous. You associate it with your mother, or your friends' mothers, and that encourages you to find one that conveys your vibe.\nTo figure out your scent identity, consider your personality and the vibe you want to exude. Mysterious and sexy?\nChoose sensual notes of jasmine, amber, or sandalwood. If you're more the fun and adventurous type, go for fresh florals like peony,violet, or freesia.\nHow to make the most of your fragrance : smooth on a scented lotion right out of the shower, then spray on the matching perfume after dressing. It extends the longevity of your scent and helps you leave your \"trail\"--something French women love to do also. We Americans, on the other hand, are stingier with scent and often blow the chance to make an impact. \"Having your perfume wafting in the air--even after you've left the room--is very seductive.
