The hunky actor transformed himself to Kenny Wells by wearing a balding head, beaky nose, protruding teeth and prosthetic belly. Matthew donned a cheap and unflattering grey suit with tropical print silk tie and brown shoes. At one point, an assistant could be seen adjusting the 45-year-old actor's false teeth as he waited patiently between takes. He was seen puffing cigarette while toting around a briefcase. Matthew also filmed a scene with co-star Bryce Dallas Howard . Bryce looked beautiful in a gold 80s-style dress which showed her cleavage and long legs. The \" Jurassic World \" actress sported red lipstick and her hair was styled in small curls. She completed her look with gold accessories, a box clutch and strappy heels. Directed by Stephen Gaghan, \"Gold\" is based on a true story of the Bre-X Mineral Corporation mining scandal and is set in the early '90s. The film centers on Kenny Wells, a struggling businessman who is trying to get back on his feet. He later teams up with a luckless geologist ( Edgar Ramirez ) in an effort to find gold deep in the uncharted jungles of Indonesia. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Gold News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:59:31.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
