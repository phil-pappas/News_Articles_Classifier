Hughes South Bend Tribune   Posted on Oct 2, 2015 by Andrew Hughes \nApril 30 marked the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War. \nAnd director Jewel Abram-Copenhaver intends to emphasize history and the personal tragedies of the war with South Bend Civic Theatre's production of \"Miss Saigon\" that opens Friday. \n\"I was purposeful on that note and have decided to take out the romanticism of how musical theater turns everything into something happy,\" she says. \"I think musical theater romanticizes war, and we decided at the beginning, that we would not do that. Our theme is casualties of the heart and history.\" \nBased on Giacomo Puccini's opera \"Madame Butterfly\" and written by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg, Alain Boublil and Richard Maltby Jr., \"Miss Saigon\" premiered in London in 1989 and moved to Broadway two years later. \nThe musical opens in Saigon on the eve of the American evacuation. Several U.S. Marines go to a local nightclub, where young Vietnamese girls are dancers and prostitutes. The American Chris Scott meets Kim, a 17-year-old virgin that Chris' friend, John, hires for him. \n\"I started with the vision that we should look at these people as real people experiencing a real war and what brought them here and not romanticize them,\" Abram-Copenhaver says about the musical in general and the women in particular. \n\"I think when we look at the despair of the Vietnam women and make them look like they love doing this and are sexy and hot and that The Engineer is funny and we should cheer him on, that's not how I read the play,\" she says. \"The women are in distress. ... We're hoping it shows the desperation for the people who were there at the time.\" \nThe two fall in love and marry quickly, but when the Marines are evacuated, Chris must leave Kim behind, unaware she is pregnant with his child. \nThe action shifts to 1978, and John now works to unify Vietnam veterans with the offspring they left behind and informs Chris about Kim and his son. Now married to Ellen, Chris and she fly to Bangkok, where Kim and the nightclub owner, The Engineer, have taken refuge. \n\"A big part of it is about love and doing what we need to do and have to do with the pain in our souls,\" Abram-Copenhaver says. \"That's the part that a lot of people might romanticize, but I see the casualties of war. ... This really happened, and people were hurt by it.\" \nThat includes Chris, who is being played by Tribune staff writer Lincoln Wright. \n\"He has been worn down by the war,\" Abram-Copenhaver says about the character. \"He feels a connection, but he doesn't know why. He genuinely sees the people. At first, I think he tries to hide from that. Kim brings it out, and he becomes empathetic. I think his empathy gets him in a lot of trouble.\" \nFor Kim, Abram-Copenhaver cast Shana Dagny, a Chicago-based actress who has played the role before. \n\"She has a strong belief in people, because if she didn't, she would never have held onto the love of Chris,\" the director says. \"She keeps praying to her dead parents and thanking them for watching over her and blessing them. Even though her life gets worse and worse, she still has this hope and believes in people and has this love that she transfers to her child.\" \nThat puts Kim in contrast to the other characters. \n\"We went with casualties of the heart because Kim is the hero but not because she chooses all the right things to do,\" Abram-Copenhaver says. \"She's the hero because she stands up, above all, for her child. ... Most of the other characters are there just to survive for themselves, even Chris.\" \nIn keeping with its operatic source and unlike most musicals, \"Miss Saigon\" contains no dialogue, only singing. \n\"You hear music the whole time, but you also hear story and words,\" Abram-Copenhaver says. \"I had seen it multiple times and didn't remember it's all sung. You just get caught up in the story. It's like Shakespeare: Your ear gets used to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:11:08.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
