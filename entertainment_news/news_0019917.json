McGough Nature Park in Largo, Florida - the story of JR the OWL as witnessed and told by the nature park's first inhabitants, 'THE TURTLES'. \nSARAH, the nature park director, would say that you never work a day in your life if you like what you're doing! Although she believes in these words of wisdom, she needs to reach out for more help as the summer day camps are about to start. \nCALVIN likes to think that he is a skater - but not this summer! He has been grounded because he got in a bit of trouble and was sentenced to 6 weeks of community service. He finds himself assigned to the nature park for the summer! \nKYLE is new to Florida and was not happy to leave his friends behind just as the summer started. His parents had to make the move due to his father's new job. \nThe turtles, HANK, RAFI & GOLIATH, and their community live in a beautiful pond with nice clean water, lots of food and are witnesses to all the events of the park as they get ready for another busy summer camp season, never suspecting what is about to happen at the park and to themselves. \nAbout This project: \nDirector Luc Campeau has been visiting the park since his youngest son was 2 years old. He says, \"It's a wonderful park to visit with young children. It's fun to feed the turtles. We were visiting the park regularly from time to time. At the time, there was only one cage with one owl and his name was JR. A few times we encountered a teenager named Joel that was working as a volunteer and \"walking\" JR. It was spectacular for Samuel to see the owl out of his cage. Joel was holding JR on his arm with a special glove made for the birds of prey. One day we walked by JR's cage and JR was gone. We went inside the information center and asked the volunteer inside what had happened to JR. We learned that vandals had opened the cage and scared JR away. The volunter also said how everyone was worried that JR couldn't survive in the wild because he was not used to providing for his own survival. Joel went into the pine forest and found JR perched at the top of a pine tree. He waited there, hoping that JR would come back to him and his glove, but he didn't. Finally, after a few days, Joel was relieved to find some stools of JR with animal fur indicating that he was able to hunt on his own to ensure his survival. \nDirector Luc Campeau says, \"This was a great story to tell. We had a GREAT cast & crew! We became the 'TURTLE TALE FAMILY'. We hope to convey just how wonderful this park and their TURTLES truly are.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1RPUg5C More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:32:11.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
