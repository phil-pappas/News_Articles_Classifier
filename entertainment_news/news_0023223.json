The blackjack dealer at the Golden Nugget pays her taxes. The dishwashers at Harrah's Resort pay their taxes.\nBut according to a few lawmakers, Jerry Seinfeld and Paul McCartney should be relieved of any tax burden whenever they play Atlantic City, because that break would incentivize them to return to the struggling casinos more often.\nWait, don't say it: The pension fund is running dry, there isn't a penny for transportation, and municipalities are bleeding to death – but Gladys Knight needs a few extra Pips, so New Jersey should accommodate those show biz A-listers as long as they agree to play four times in the \"tourism district\" of A.C.?\nLet's applaud Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. (R-Union) and Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) for at least trying to think outside the box to help the struggling neon outpost, now that four of the casinos are in mothballs. Drastic times, these.\nBut a more practical solution might be to convince their Governor to come home and sign the Atlantic City rescue package that has been gathering dust since June.\nMORE STAR-LEDGER EDITORIALS Instead, the legislators took a weird cue from Vegas – where Britney Spears, queen of the lip-sync, signed a two-year residency deal with Planet Hollywood to join the ranks of tax-free Nevada denizens – and they came up this Britney Bill.\nThat Vegas gambit was written up by Business Insider , a news candy publication run by a disgraced Wall Street analyst for financiers who like cleavage photos, which said Spears generated a $20 million net profit for the Vegas casino.\nKean cited that report. He did not cite another report from State Tax Notes that calls his bill the \" silliest tax proposal of the year .\"\nBut they may have overlooked two key points: No A-list talent has ever told an Atlantic City venue that he cannot play more than one night in Jersey because of the tax burden; and the services of such stars aren't even desirable for more than one or two visits.\n\"We simply don't need repeat artists – we have repeat customers, so we need more diverse programs,\" says Joe Lupo, the executive VP at the Borgata, which has the largest entertainment budget in town. \"That's why we don't have long-running shows like they do in Las Vegas. The artist dates are more about supply and demand than tax credits, and with so few big venues on the other side of the state, (the Britney Bill) would have no effect.\"\nYet here's the wackiest part of the bill: If an A-lister plays four gigs in Atlantic City in relatively tiny hall, he gets to play the 20,000-seat Prudential Center tax-free.\nTax breaks are not a panacea in Atlantic City. Casinos received tax breaks, and they're dropping like dead fruit. And anyone who thinks Britney Spears is a good model for anything – particularly entertainment or tax policy – needs to see her act.\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @StarLedger and find us on Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Star.Ledger", "http://www.taxanalysts.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-A2EFS9?OpenDocument", "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/08/business-outsider", "http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S3000/2721_I1.PDF", "http://www.businessinsider.com/britney-spears-planet-hollywood-profit-boost-2014-10", "https://twitter.com/starledger"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:09:48.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
