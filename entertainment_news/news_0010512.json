THEATER REVIEW \nCLEVER LITTLE LIES \nNew off-Broadway play, at the Westside Theatre, 407 W. 43rd St.\nWritten by Joe DiPietro. Directed by David Saint.\nWith Marlo Thomas, Greg Mullavey, George Merrick and Kate Wetherhead. \nSchedule: 7 p.m. Monday and Thursday; 8 p.m. Friday;2 and 8 p.m. Wednesday and Saturday; 3 p.m. Sunday.\nTickets: $79 and $89. 212-239-6200 or telecharge.com.\nFor much of its 90 minutes, Joe DiPietro's \"Clever Little Lies,\" which opened Monday night at the Westside Theatre under the direction of David Saint, plays like an old-fashioned comedy for the Social Security set.\nExcept for the profanity, it might have been done on Broadway 50 years ago — one of those comforting plays that promises easily soluble problems.\nIt even features a star for people with long memories: Marlo Thomas.\nThe play begins with a jokey scene between the mid-30ish Billy (George Merrick) and his father Bill Senior (Greg Mullavey), after they've played a game of tennis. Billy, who has a wife, Jane (Kate Wetherhead), and a baby daughter, seems miserable, in a comical way.\nThe reason, he finally confesses, is that he's gotten himself into a terrible spot: He's having an affair with a hot 23-year-old personal trainer whom he's come to love a lot more than he does Jane (who, truth is, is fairly irritating, which would make us root for Billy to leave her for his unseen gym goddess, except that the whiny Billy is so annoying himself, we don't give a fig about his happiness).\nBilly makes his father swear he won't reveal his secret to his mother, Alice, which means, of course, that it'll take about two minutes after Bill gets home for her to worm it out of him. (Why would a playwright give two characters the same name?)\nAlice (Thomas, in fine, perky fettle) owns a thriving bookstore, which, in these Amazon times, would make for a good, fantasy-like story in itself. She moans about the current state of fiction, particularly a sequel to a notorious bestseller, titled \"Sixty Shades of Grey.\" She complains about having to sell \"literary\" tote bags and mugs and is aghast that people read books on their phones, saying Jane Austen would be shocked.\nAlthough delivered by Thomas with panache, this isn't exactly cutting-edge material. It leads us to believe that, after summoning Billy and Jane to her home, Alice will solve their domestic problem with a predictable, mother-knows-best remedy. (Since Jane doesn't know about Billy's canoodling, there'll be lots of space for clueless-wife jokes.)\nBut, it turns out, the Tony-winning DiPietro (\"Memphis\"), who grew up in Oradell, is too sophisticated a playwright to continue on with the expected.\nThere's some preliminary humor, but the atmosphere of the family gathering begins to darken as Alice, in a mother's selfless attempt to save her son's marriage – which is an unchallenged positive goal – tells a long story that will endanger her own.\nThe shift in tone is jarring, and I don't think the twain of broad comedy and mournful sentimentality ever meet, dramatically speaking.\nThe play's closing image, though, is quite touching, suggesting in a picture the ups and downs of marital life much more vividly than did the many words that preceded it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:42:52.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
