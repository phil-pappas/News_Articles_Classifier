Photo: Syd Kearney Image 9 of 9 Witchcraft to become Republic Diner + Sojubang 1 / 9 Back to Gallery Delicious Concepts Restaurant Group has never been afraid of change.\nWitchcraft Tavern & Provision Co. on 11th Street was not its first concept in that space. When first opened in 2012, it was an Asian concept called the Dragon Bowl. And earlier this year, the company shuttered its Tex-Mex eatery, The El Cantina Superior, to remake the space into a brewpub.\nOver the summer, it was reported that former Dosi chef Jordan Asher would be taking the reins at Witchcraft and moving it away from a burger-centric menu.\nWitchcraft was closed recently for another makeover. When it reopens Oct. 22, it will be Republic Diner + Sojubang and focused on Korean cuisine, including Korean barbecue (galbi), sizzling rice hot pots (dolsot bap) and twice fried chicken.\n\"I'm excited to finally launch this amazing concept and look forward to continuing to serve the community,\" Delicious Concepts CEO Ken Bridge said in a release.\nThe restaurant will be open for lunch, dinner and late-night dining on select evenings.\nRepublic Diner + Sojubang : 1221 W. 11th, 832-649-3601\nBrowse the slideshow above to see other Delicious Concepts properties.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386831/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386835/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386834/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386830/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386832/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386837/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386833/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386835/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386832/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386834/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386836/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386836/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386837/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386833/3/920x920.jpg", "http://houston.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/07-29-15-rising-star-chef-swaps-burgers-for-innovative-shareable-dishes-at-heights-restaurant/", "http://www.witchcrafttavern.com/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386830/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/77/44/8386831/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:23:44.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
