After the whole house somehow had the actress sleep near Vikas, she told Keith that she will not sleep next to Vikas and exchanged places with him.\nWhen she slept next to Rochelle’s bed (which was technically next to Keith’s bed), Rochelle, wanting to sleep next to her boyfriend, politely asked her why she is sleeping in Keith’s bed? Hell broke loose when Mandana began justifying herself. Saying that she spoke to her partner and decided, Mandana was stubborn to not move anywhere else. Mandana, who was already in a bad mood since morning, created a ruckus and threw a hissy fit at Rochelle, leading to a yelling match over wanting to sleep next to Keith. Unaffected by the drama, Keith continued to make his bed. Hearing Mandana use the words, “my partner” from Mandana’s mouth, Rochelle replied back saying, “Your partner is my boyfriend!”\nHaving supported Mandana throughout the day when she refused to sleep near Vikas and Arvind, Rochelle thought it was only fair that Mandana supports her back. Breaking down and crying, Rochelle hugged boyfriend Keith and told him that she just wanted a minute alone with him and that she cannot tolerate this any longer. Keith, who tried to calm her down, hugged her right back and stayed that way till she felt better\nMandana went off to sleep where she had decided to and that was next to Rochelle and also said that she had no words. The housemates also tried to calm Rochelle down but she requested them to give her some time alone with Keith. Trouble in paradise when Suyyash gets upset with Kishwer\nThe much in love couple Suyyash and Kishwer seem to be facing trouble in paradise inside the Bigg Boss house. He seems to be having a problem with Aman. Suyyash thinks Aman is dominating Kishwer and is unhappy with Kishwer because she is not taking a stand for herself. Suyyash tells Rimi that he wants Kishwer to make her own independent decisions and not follow Aman's wish every time.\nWill Kishwer understand Suyyash's advice or is this is just a begining of a new fight. Keith and Mandana have an argument\nLooks like the idea behind tying the Bigg Boss contestants through hip-cuff seems to be working for the makers of the show. The first Double Trouble pair to feel the heat are Mandana and Keith. Things are not going very well between Mandana and Keith over the past few days. Be it Rochelle or the bandhan between them, Mandana is acting pretty selfish and inconsiderate. Keith takes notice of this and tells Mandana that they are a team and she needs to understand his point of view as well. Mandana refuses to cooperate with Keith and he has no choice but to give in. Further to this argument, Mandana is seen being at her selfish best and taunting Keith with Rochelle every now and then.\nHow things will turn out for the couple in the coming days. Only time will tell.
