Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil’ Kim, Mya, and Missy Elliot teamed up for the song in 2001 for the flick Moulin Rouge! \nOra’s dream team? Miley Cyrus, Charlie XCX and Iggy Azalea. \nBut it turns out the universe believes perfection was achieved in 2001 and people on social media were quick to smack down this new proposal. \nThe hate got so bad even Iggy took to Twitter to wash her hands of the issue and let everyone know she had nothing to do with the idea.
