Just when life had become intolerable for these best friends, a glimmer of hope arrives in the form of an old man with a purpose.”\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Laretz’s book is a fascinating tale of Tommy and Monty’s plans to join an army, which intends to overthrow the very government that has inflicted the suffering.\nReaders who wish to experience this gripping work can purchase “The Boys from Bakersfield” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
