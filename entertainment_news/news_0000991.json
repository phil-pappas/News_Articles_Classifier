It’s the fifth coffee shop to open on Main Street. Starting in the Bradley University area, you have One World, Starbucks, Broken Tree, thirty-thirty and now Buzzed Coffee. “I’m really excited to be finally open. We’ve been working on it since April,” White said of the shop’s interior with a stage that allows customers to look out on Main Street. There’s also room for a lounge area in the back. In between, there’s coffee. “I’ve had so many people say that they’re so glad that there’s finally a coffee shop open in this part of Downtown,” said White, 35. Along with all types of coffee (White’s favorite is the Almond Joy latte), Buzzed offers pastries provided by Historic Grounds, a bakery in Metamora. It’s a family operation with White whipping up coffee drinks along with her sister, Kylee Unterbrunk. Keith Wilson, Unterbrink’s boyfriend, did much of the art that adorns the walls at Buzzed. Store hours are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., Saturday. White said she plans on using the shop to hold poetry readings and art classes after hours. “I also plan on doing things with the local autism society,” said White, the mother of an autistic daughter. Also announced this week was a new plan for the Cornerstone Building, 321 NE Madison Ave. A Springfield microbrewery and restaurant called Obed and Isaac's has announced plans to open there by June 2016. “We plan on using the entire facility. In fact, we’ll have to build out for the brewery,” said Brian Tippy, corporate administrator for Conn’s Hospitality Group in Springfield. Court and Karen Conn have developed a number of successful ventures in Springfield that have involved historic restoration, he said. “We call it preserving history through hospitality,” said Tippy The Peoria microbrewery’s menu will be similar to that of the Springfield location, along with outdoor dining, bocce ball courts and bags, he said. Vacant for more than a year, the Cornerstone Building was originally devised by renowned Chicago architect W.W. Boyington, who designed that city’s famous Water Tower. The building was constructed for the Second Presbyterian Church in 1889, then known as the Donmeyer Temple after being sold to the Electra Chapter of the Order of Eastern Star in 1937. It later housed a number of small businesses and in recent years remained popular for weddings and parties. Steve Tarter is Journal Star business editor.
