Not with that plate discipline, anyway.\nAfter consecutive walks and then a base hit to start Game 3 of the National League Division Series, Soler had walked five times to go along with a homer, double and single.\nThat’s just Jorge being Manny.\nNo, wait, that’s Jorge being better than Cubs special batting instructor Manny Ramirez. That Jorge being better than anyone.\nSoler became the first hitter to reach base in his first eight playoff plate appearances.\nNo, wait, nine. With the Cubs clinging to a 5-4 lead in the sixth, Soler pounded Adam Wainwright’s first pitch for a two-run homer.\nManager Joe Maddon said Soler is “accepting his walks’’ and forcing pitchers to come into the strike zone. When that happens, Soler makes painfully good contact.\nThe manager who always stresses being in the moment then offered that “down the road what this moment means to us developmentally’’ is priceless.\nBut here’s the thing, Joe: You don’t have to look down the road. You can just look down the lineup.\nKris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Starlin Castro, and Kyle Schwarber already had gone deep before the game was five innings old. Soler made it 2-3-4-5-6 in the order with homers. Then Dexter Fowler homered to make it 1-2-3-4-5-6 and make the six homers a major-league record.\nIf it weren’t for the slackers at the bottom of the order, the Cubs might’ve really had something going.\nExcept for Fowler, they’re all under 27, by the way. They could be together for a while. Back at ya, Cardinals.\nSpeaking of plate discipline, Castro waited out a breaking pitch and slammed it into the stands in the fourth inning to tie the game at 2-all. That’s professional stuff.\nThere should be some kind of award Castro could win this season. A guy who loses his starting spot, and then responds like an All-Star player and teammate deserves something. I guess a spot in the lineup will do for now.\nIf you don’t think you can get a fastball past Schwarber, then he’s just going to hit your off-speed pitch for a homer. I think it’s a rule.\nChicago Cubs tweet: “Wait were we supposed to give @kschwarb a curtain call @Cardinals?’’ I thought it was just the media that made fun of the supposed best fans in baseball and the team that wrote the book.\nOf course Bryant broke out of his 0-11 postseason slump. He had a 1.037 on-base-plus-slugging percentage at Wrigley Field, where he hit 21 of his 26 homers.\nHold on, that just doesn’t happen to Jake Arrieta. He doesn’t give up four earned runs in a game. Heck, he doesn’t give up four earned runs in a month. Not in September or August, anyway.\nThe Cardinals showed excellent discipline in laying off Arrieta’s breaking pitches early. That started running up his pitch count.\nThen Arrieta did it to himself when he lost command in the fourth and gave up two runs.\nAnd then he couldn’t finish the sixth, which hadn’t happened since June 16, a stretch of 21 starts counting the wild-card game.\nPerhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise when the Cardinals are involved. They do this to aces. There’s a long list, but just look at last year’s playoffs when they beat Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw twice, and both times it was Monday’s starter Michael Wacha who beat him.\nArrieta got the win Monday, but it didn’t look like the others. I hope that was only a rocky outing and not a case of feeling his career high in innings. Because there are expectations of a lot more innings this month.\nArrieta was appreciative, if not au courant , when it came to his offensive support. He described his slugging teammates as “on point,’’ but I believe all the popular kids say “on fleek.’’\nSay it with me, Jake: “On fleek.’’ Good, now tweet it to the facebook so you’re on the Interwebs sounding phat. Or groovy. Or dope. I’m not sure which. Ask the popular kids.\nUsually, Pedro Strop vs. the Cardinals is like Chris Sale vs. the Twins. But not in the eighth inning Monday. Strop needed that inning against the Cardinals. The Cubs needed Strop to have that inning against the team that tortures him. Maddon being Maddon.\nI’m not sure the Cubs needed Hector Rondon to have that ninth inning, however.\nI don’t know how patient Maddon will be with Jason Hammel in Game 4 today, not because it’s a potential clincher but because it’s Jason Hammel. If I had to guess, I’d say Maddon will let him stay in the game until the first 3-and-0 count.\nThe Cubs have never won a postseason series at Wrigley Field. But to be fair, Wrigley has only been around since 1914.\nWhen the vaunted Cardinals pitching staff needed shutdown innings after getting some runs, Castro homered in the fourth and Soler punished Adam Wainwright in the sixth. That’s a rookie playoff team doing what the veteran team in the other dugout always seems to do.\nI know it was a hamstring injury and not a hand injury for Addison Russell, but the Cubs have to coach the stupid out of Russell and everybody else with those head-first slides.\nWas the TBS pitch window doing some pregame drinking in Wrigleyville?\n Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Jorge Soler St. Louis Cardinals Joe Maddon Starlin Castro", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d029e/turbine/ct-cubs-soler-cardinals-playoffs-rosenbloom-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:40:16.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
