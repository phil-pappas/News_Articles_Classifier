Canada have produced some good performances so far as the plucky underdogs, and hope to finally pick up a win having tested, but ultimately failing against France over the weekend.\n7.30pm: Pool A: Fiji v Uruguay\nKick-Off: 8.00pm\nStadium: Stadium MK\nThe pool's two most unfancied sides of Pool A battle it out in the day's late kick-off. The nations have only met on two previous occasions, with Fiji taking the honours both times, and each team is expected to enter this match playing for what is likely to be a fourth place position. Expect to see the ball thrown around a lot, as both sides have so far shown they're here to play attacking football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:15:42.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
