But her husband had a solid alibi: He was at work at the time.\n\"We were all so scared,\" fellow waitress Siana Nikolav tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant.\n\"Was somebody stalking her? Was someone obsessed with her?\" co-worker Lacey Green asks.\n\"She was his world,\" Maria McGrew says of her brother, George. \"That was his, his life. And then, when their daughter came around, they were just the cutest trio ever.\"\nIn addition to members of Shauna Tiaffay's and George Tiaffay's families, the episode includes interviews with investigators and maintenance man William Pennix, whose tip eventually led police to George Tiaffay.\nContact Christopher Lawrence at clawrence@reviewjournal.com .
