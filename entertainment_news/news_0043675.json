Some, naturally, will pop up in utterly surprising fashion, the way Hassan Whiteside’s emergence caught everyne offguard. Others will be cast aside because of injury, such as Jabari Parker’s rookie season. But these 10 stories should stand the test of time, the Stonehenge of NBA questions. (Subject to change, of course.)\nCan the Golden State Warriors dominate again? Not only did the Warriors win the NBA title, they also outscored opponents by 10.1 points a game, the best margin since the 2007-08 Boston Celtics. But so much went right for them, as is usually the case with a championship team. Andrew Bogut played in 67 regular-season games and 19 in the playoffs, his largest total since the 87 he played between regular and postseason in his rookie season in 2005-06. Shaun Livingston did the same and more, between 78 regular-season games and 21 in the playoffs, he set a career high. Both key cogs in the Golden State team have experienced more than their share of injuries. Can they stay healthy again? Will Harrison Barnes build on his late-season emergence? Can Stephen Curry get even better?\nUSA TODAY\nNBA Western Conference Preview\nJust how good are the Cleveland Cavaliers? It is easy to get caught up in the remarkable performance by LeBron James throughout the playoffs, particularly a Finals in which he without question deserved to be named MVP, and forget that for a decent chunk of the season James was well off the level of play he’d established over the previous seven seasons. James hadn’t dipped below 29.1 in player efficiency rating in any of those seasons, but in 2014-15 he dropped to 25.3. James will be 31 in December and has logged more career NBA minutes than Larry Bird or Magic Johnson. Of course, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving are key to this team, but James is what makes the Cavaliers transcendent. And anyone’s ability to do that often tends to slow down with age, even one of the three best players in league history.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Western Conference preview\nCan Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor play together? On paper, it looks like a tremendous pairing of the extraordinary defending of Noel with the advanced offensive game of Okafor. But will the Philadelphia 76ers teammates get in each other’s way?\nWhat will the Chicago Bulls be without Tom Thibodeau? The much-respected coach is out, and Fred Hoiberg is in. Nobody got more out of his players when they were on the floor than Thibodeau, and whether Hoiberg can do the same is unknown.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Is Eastern Conference the Cavaliers' to lose?\nHave the New York Knicks improved enough? Carmelo Anthony is back healthy, and the team’s free agent additions, while low-key, seem to fit together well. That’s especially true for center Robin Lopez, the perfect choice for a defensively challenged unit that had 17 wins last season. But have they added the roughly 20 wins they’ll need for a playoff appearance?\nAre the Toronto Raptors finally balanced? The Raptors won 49 games last season but couldn’t stop anyone when it mattered. Now they’ve added DeMarre Carroll and Bismack Biyombo, among others, to change that. Will their elite offensive efficiency suffer as a result?\nAre the Miami Heat a title contender? Chris Bosh is back, as is Goran Dragic, signed to a long-term contract. Whiteside will be playing major minutes from the start of the season. And Justise Winslow looks like he can help from the start. Just how quickly has Pat Riley recovered from LeBron leaving?\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Surprise teams and David West interview\nWill the Orlando Magic finally make the leap? They stayed with the same core, largely, adding Jason Smith to a young group keyed by Victor Oladipo, Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon. Will Scott Skiles finally turn this collection of young talent into a contender?\nCan the Oklahoma City Thunder persuade Kevin Durant to stay? Billy Donovan is in the fold as the new coach, and the Thunder have one more year to show KD his best career move would be sticking with his only professional team.\nWhat does Kobe Bryant have left? This is almost certainly the final season in purple and gold for one of the greatest to ever play the game. Just what can the Los Angeles Lakers star show the basketball world before he exits the Hollywood stage?\nUSA TODAY\nNBA Eastern Conference preview: If healthy, Cavs favored", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/677c3b8e0658c38a39e4eeb474fbcb4c07b6641b/c=0-61-3041-1779&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804136816248916-USP-NBA--Miami-Heat-at-New-Orleans-Pelicans.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nba/2015/10/13/73885996/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2015/10/14/nba-a-to-z-podcast-david-west-alvin-gentry-dell-demps/73917840/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1022470c07f88b99d0b47c212e506708b9885c0d/c=0-158-2227-2385/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784294286411224-AP-Cavaliers-Bulls-Basketball.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nba/2015/10/15/73990030/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4555845871001_video-still-for-video-4553078974001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed5cc02511c4b134209457a69dd0b62c060ac869/c=491-0-2681-2190/local/-/media/2015/09/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635781896140653936-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4560041750001_video-still-for-video-4560003743001.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2015/09/18/nba-z-podcast-western-conference-preview/72416972/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2015/09/21/nba-z-podcast-eastern-conference-preview-cavaliers-bulls-wizards-bucks-heat/72559614/"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:49:44.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
