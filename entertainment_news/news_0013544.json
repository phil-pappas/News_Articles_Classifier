The facility complements in Bloomington that serves customers farther west.\nDeveloped on land Robert W. Miner had owned along the 10 freeway since 1986, the Palm Springs plant on Indian Canyon Drive is four times bigger than the FedEx Ground plant the package handlers vacated on the outskirts of Desert Hot Springs.\n“I love it,” Lomack Gray said as he pumped gasoline into a FedEx Ground truck at a nearby Pilot fueling station for his early-morning runs.\nThe new FedEx Ground hub, built by The Kiernan Companies of Coronado, will receive, sort and deliver boxed and sealed packages to customers in a coverage area that stretches from Beaumont east to Niland, and from Idyllwild north to Twentynine Palms.\n“We got a new building; new uniforms,” Gray said. “And everything’s more organized.”\nGray said morale is better, too, because the streamlined operation has already reduced down-time to load the fleet of trucks and pull out of the lot.\n“Every minute counts in this business,” he said. “Anytime we can trim off an hour is a big thing for us.”\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, delivery and other truck drivers comprise one of the largest occupations in the U.S., holding 3.2 million jobs. It’s also one of the fastest growing.\nThe FedEx Ground center’s opening comes at a time when logistics centers, warehouses and industrial property are blazing ahead. A recent forecast by UC Riverside’s Center for Economic Forecasting and Development has called industrial property growth the “star child” of Inland Southern California.\nThe region has become a hotbed for construction and warehouse occupancy in this realm: The lineup of product handlers moving into big warehouse space in the Inland Empire include: Amazon, Amrapur Overseas, reLogistics Services, the German grocer Aldi and Deckers Outdoor.\nChristopher Gopal, senior fellow at Claremont Graduate University’s Drucker Center for Supply Chain and Logistics in Claremont, said the FedEx Ground plant is a big deal.\n“Any increase in supply chain and logistics is a key driver for the whole Inland Empire area,” Gopal said.\n“The rise in e-commerce is driving a lot of this,” Gopal added. “With e-Commerce and Omni channel fulfillment on the rise, there’s no way to go but to see plants like FedEx Ground increase operations.\nFedEx Ground spokeswoman Nikki Mendicino said the new Palm Springs facility is part of a nationwide network expansion to increase daily package volume capacity and enhance the speed and service capabilities across the FedEx Ground network.\nThe Palm Springs site was picked for its proximity to major highways – it is a stone’s throw from the I-10 eastbound exit – customer base, range of distribution centers and local workforce, she said. Unlike FedEx offices that deal with customers, this plant is not open to the public.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwotv3-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck55a.20.jpg", "http://bit.ly/1Kv5XZc", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwotv4-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck55h.20.jpg", "http://fedex.com/careers", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwotv4-b88540155z.120151023122135000g98ck458.20.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwotv3-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck556.20.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwotv3-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck558.20.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwotv3-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck55a.20.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwotv4-b88540155z.120151023122135000g98ck458.20.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://www.watchasort.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwotv3-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck556.20.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwotv4-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck55h.20.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwotv3-b88540155z.120151023122135000gvpck558.20.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:11:51.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
