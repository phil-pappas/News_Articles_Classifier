Tonight the Rane family return to their home after the ordeal. Desmond is keen to get back to normal (how weird is that dude by the way?) but Annette is haunted by her experience and cannot understand how he is able to put it behind him so easily. While Danny continues to hide out as the police investigation gets underway, but doesn't realise who else is looking for him. So far so good with this series, definitely keeps you hooked in and great performances, especially from that little girl. Think we may have the next Saoirse Ronan there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:51:39.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
