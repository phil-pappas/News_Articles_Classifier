On my way to work 😉 see you on BBC @VictoriaLIVE when I will be talking all things domestic violence & how together we can make it stop \n— Danniella westbrook (@westbrookdanni) October 20, 2015 \nIn the film, Danniella visited a refuge and spoke to two women, Anita and Anna (not their real names), who are both living in the refuge. Their words were spoken by someone else in the film to protect their identities. \nIn the segment, the emotional presenter listened to Anna, who recounted her abusive relationship of 10 years. \n“I got woken up by a head butt straight into my face,” she told Danniella. She went on to say “he was my addiction”. At 09:15 on @BBCTwo , @westbrookdanni goes inside a women's refuge to see the brutal reality of domestic violence https://t.co/2FfGQpMSYB \n— Victoria Derbyshire (@VictoriaLIVE) October 20, 2015 Promoted stories \nDanniella has spoken openly about her very public battle with cocaine addiction. \nShe said: “I can identify with the addict side of things. I can totally identify with that and what we do and who we become to get closer to our drug of choice.” \nThe 41-year-old actress relapsed in 2014 after being clean for many years, following the breakdown of her marriage. \nTalking to Victoria as a studio guest, she said: “My marriage broke down through no fault of my own and I was in a place that I was absolutely devastated… I went back to what I knew, I self- medicated… and that’s what these people, who are in these relationships, do… it’s like the drugs, they end up controlling your life. It’s very sad, but it is what it is and we all have our addictions one way or another.” Danniella Westbrook in 2005 (Ian West/PA) \nWhen asked by Victoria about when she “last took cocaine”, she said: “I’m here to talk about domestic violence, I’m not here to talk about taking cocaine. But I haven’t taken cocaine for while.” \nStatistics reported by Victoria showed that 350 refuges exist in the UK, but over the last four years, 32 have closed down and others are under threat. Share article \nA spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: “Domestic abuse is a completely devastating and unacceptable crime, which is why we maintain a strong safety net for its victims. This year we committed over £3 million to specialist accommodation for victims, including refuges, and that builds on the £10 million we already committed in March.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:43:03.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
