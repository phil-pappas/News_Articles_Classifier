In the 1990s, Ornellaia's reputation flowered, but the costs of producing a world-class wine required more money.\nOrnellaia vineyard courtesy of Ornellaia In 2000, Robert Mondavi bought a minority share in Ornellaia; two years later, Mondavi and the centuries-old Tuscan wine family, Marchesi di Frescobaldi bought out Antinori. The ownership changed again in 2005 when Frescobaldi bought Mondavi's share.\nThroughout the merry-go-round of ownership, Ornellaia maintained its quality under general manager Leonardo Raspini, winemaker Thomas Duroux (who departed for Chateau Palmer in mid-2004) and the arrival in 2005 of current winemaker â€“Bordeaux educated and trained-- Axel Heinz.\nA few months ago, Heinz arrived in Manhattan and presented Ornellaia's newest wines, along with three older vintages.\nOrnellaia tasting photo by John Foy While Ornellaia is recognized as one of Italy's top red wines, Heinz also makes a first-rate white wine, Poggio alle Gazze dell'Ornellaia . The 2013 Poggio alle Gazze blends 69 percent sauvignon blanc with viognier, vermentino and verdicchio.\nFor the 2013 Poggio alle Gazze , Heinz fermented half the grapes in a mix of new and used oak barrels and half in stainless-steel tanks and cement vats; this process coaxed the pineapple and citrus scent and lemon-y flavor from the grapes, and retained the crisp acidity by foregoing malolactic fermentation.\nThe 2013 Poggio alle Gazze has the structure of a premier cru Chablis, perfect balance of fruit and acidity, and not a trace of alcohol or aggressive oak. It is an outstanding white wine and retails for about $70.\nLike Bordeaux's chateaux, Ornellaia produces a second wine: Le Serre Nuova dell' Ornellaia . It is made from grapes of younger vines, or barrels of wine judged to be good, but below the level of Ornellaia.\nOrnellaia barrel aging room courtesy of Ornellaia The 2012 Le Serre Nuove is 52 percent merlot, 28 percent cabernet sauvignon, plus petit verdot and cabernet franc. Its black cherry color, and aromas of blackberry, vanilla and mild smoky oak are pleasant introductions; blackberry and cherry flavors are carried on a medium body harmonized with gentle tannins. The 2012 Le Serre Nuove was a delightful wine and reminded me of some St. Emilion's Grand Cru Classe wines. It retails for about $59.\nHeinz composed the 2012 Ornellaia with 56 percent cabernet sauvignon, 27 percent merlot, along with cabernet franc and petit verdot. It brings a Haut-Medoc elegant structure and profile with its black cherry and oak aromas and flavors and mellow tannins.\nThe 2012 Ornellaia is drinkable after 30 minutes aeration, but a few years in your cellar will add complexity. It retails for about $195.\nHeinz presented the 2007 , 2004 and 2002 Ornellaias . While the 2007 and 2004 reflected the excellence of those vintages; the 2002 captured my attention.\nMade in a rain-plagued year, and during Ornellaia's management turmoil, the 2002 Ornellaia was a pleasant, balanced, red fruit-flavored wine. It showed the inherent quality of Ornellaia's vineyard and the wisdom of its Bordeaux formula.\nA Glass of Wine appears every week in Today.
