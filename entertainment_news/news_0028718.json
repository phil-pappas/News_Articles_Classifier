The all-acoustic lineup also featured Ben Harper, St. Vincent, Gary Clark Jr., Spoon, Nils Lofgren and, of course, Young, performing with the act Promise of the Real. \nThose same acts, minus only Lofgren, were expected to perform for fans on Sunday (Day Two). \nThe concerts support Hillsborough's Bridge School, a program for the communicative and educational development of children with severe speech and physical impairments. \nMost of the performances on Saturday were good. A few were excellent. And none were terrible. \nIn comparison to past Bridge Benefits, this 29th annual event ranked somewhere in the middle of the pack. \nOf course, that's not how many would-be ticket buyers saw it. The 2015 Bridge didn't prove all that popular at the box office, only bringing in roughly 14,000 fans to the 22,000-capacity Shoreline on Saturday. It was definitely one of the smallest crowds I've seen at a Saturday Bridge show, out of the 20-plus years I've attended the event. And an even smaller crowd was expected to show on Sunday. Advertisement \nWhy the low turnout? Well, it likely had something to do with Young's bizarre decision to play his own headlining show (also with Promise of the Real) just one week prior at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley. That certainly didn't help his drawing power for the Bridge. \nYet, an even bigger problem was the lineup, which was roasted by many -- somewhat unfairly -- for being subpar the moment it was released. That's what happens when you spoil an audience with a steady supply of such Rock and Roll Hall of Famers as Paul McCartney, R.E.M., David Bowie, The Who, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith and Metallica over the years. \nThe top attraction on this year's bill was the reunited Dixie Chicks, one of the biggest country acts of all time. The group -- vocalist Natalie Maines, guitarist Emily Robison Strayer and fiddle player Martie Maguire -- sounded terrific onstage, showcasing the wonderful harmonies and edgy country that resulted in multiple Grammy wins and over 30 million albums sold. \nThe Dixie Chicks opened their 35-minute set with \"The Long Way Around\" from \"Taking the Long Way,\" the 2006 blockbuster that still stands as the band's most recent album. \nThe group mined its one catalog for such gems as \"Sin Wagon\" and \"Not Ready to Make Nice,\" and even threw in a couple of cover songs. The first was expected — the Dixies' smash take on Fleetwood Mac's immortal \"Landslide.\" The second offering was a complete surprise — a powerful play on Lana Del Rey's \"Video Games.\" \nAnother highlight of the night was Ryan Adams' set. The folk-rocker was absolutely charming onstage, making up songs on the spot and otherwise goofing around with the crowd. Unfortunately, he didn't perform any material from \"1989\" -- Adams' inspired re-imagining of Taylor Swift's entire \"1989\" album -- but he did play his wonderful \"New York, New York\" as well as revisit his Whiskeytown days for \"Jacksonville Skyline.\" \nSheryl Crow also did a fine job with her set, igniting smiles and singalongs during such fan favorites as \"If It Makes You Happy\" and \"A Change Would Do You Good.\" The future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was definitely in the mood to collaborate, calling out the Dixie Chicks, blues-rocker Gary Clark Jr. and indie-pop fave St. Vincent to join her onstage. \nSt. Vincent and Clark also put on their own winning solo sets, while Ben Harper and Spoon definitely appealed to the crowd. Many fans had left by the time Young and Promise of the Real (with Nils Lofgren on piano) took the stage around midnight, kicking off the night's final set with \"Human Highway.\" \nFollow Jim Harrington at http://twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:30:03.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
