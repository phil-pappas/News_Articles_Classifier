The Comedy Central star revealed in an interview with Maria Shriver on \" Today \" show, \"It's an emotional thing. It's been a struggle for me my whole life, and especially just being in the entertainment industry.\" \"Standing on a stage in front of people, I can't perform my best or be confident if I'm not sure - if I'm pulling at something [I'm wearing]. And sometimes I would just want to throw in the towel and be like, 'I'm not gonna go do standup tonight,' \" the comedienne continued. She then went on to say that she and her sister \"have always dressed badly,\" but that changed after she met stylist Leesa Evans on the set of \" Trainwreck \". She explained, \"Leesa had given me this gift of showing me how to dress and feel good. And she didn't have to do this, she just did.\" The \" Inside Amy Schumer \" star added, \"She shopped for my sister also, and seeing my little sister wearing a little blazer and a shirt and looking just like a strong, beautiful woman, it was ... to see this person I care the most about being given those tools was really moving for me.\" Schumer couldn't contain her emotion as she continued, \"It was such a gift to be given to learn how to dress, to feel good about myself, and that's the gift we want to give to everyone, everywhere.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:48:52.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
