The group has a legacy relationship with the prominent music festival held in China's capital and is one of the long-standing sponsors of the event. Hundreds of Mercuria counterparties joined for the festivities.\nThis year's Mercuria Night focused on the music of German composer Johannes Brahms with a performance by the WDR Symphony Orchestra (Westdeutscher Rundfunkorchester formerly the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra). Violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann was welcomed by conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste. The orchestra performed Violin Concerto in D Major Op. 77 and Symphony No. 4 in E Minor, Op. 98.\n\"Mercuria sponsors the Beijing Music Festival because talent, history and the celebration of the cultures where we operate are core to our business model,\" said Han Jin , a co-founder of Mercuria and president of Mercuria Asia. \"Just like Mercuria, the music festival has a strong and deep connection to China and Chinese skills, but also celebrates expertise and history from around the world.\"\nMercuria Night was held in the historic Zhong Shan Park , located to the west of Tian'AnMen in the heart of the Forbidden City. Mercuria Night events were held amongst a large pond, peonies rock gardens, pavilions and the Forbidden City moat.\nAlmost since the inception of Mercuria, the company has sponsored the month-long event, one of the most prominent music festivals in China . The festival focuses on music education and accessibility to the public. Each festival features free concerts for young people and children. The festival holds Master Classes each year in the Central Conservatory. More than 6,000 people have had instruction from well-known Chinese and foreign artists such as Issac Stern , Fou Ts'ong, Mo Hualun, Melvyn Tan , Lo King-man, Liao Naixiong, and the Kodaly Quartet.\nSince Mercuria began sponsoring the month-long event, artists participating have included the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra playing the songs of John Lennon , violin master Pinchas Zuckerman with the China Philharmonic Orchestra, an opera gala by Deutsche Opera Berlin, and cellists Mischa Maisky and Lily Maisky's Russian Romances.\nFor more information, visit http://www.mercuria.com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151018/277990\n releases/mercuria-energy-celebrates-2015-beijing-international-music-festival-300161638.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.mercuria.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151018/277990", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC31224&Transmission_Id=201510181241PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC31224&DateId=20151018", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151018/277990", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mercuria-energy-celebrates-2015-beijing-international-music-festival-300161638.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:22:22.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
