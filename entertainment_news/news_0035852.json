She asked him to perform a \"gun draw\" in 2012, and he replied: \"I'd rather suck pus out of an abscess.\" \nSo one would think it's best to avoid this line of questioning, right? Not so for UK showbiz reporter Sarah Powell who, in an excruciatingly awkward interview, repeatedly asked him to pout. \nFacing the barrage of 'pout' requests, Craig starts by saying he doesn't know what she's talking about, to giving a blunt \"no\", to finally stating \"I think it's time to move on.\" \nPowell also asked why he didn't strip off: \"There's no swimwear, there's no tearing of the shirt off. What happened, why haven't you got your kit off?\" \n\"It just didn't happen\" he replied. \nShe then asked if Bond had gone \"shy\" and he replied: \"He's going shy now.\" \nThe interview took a turn for the surreal when she attempted to gift Craig a giant car sticker with his wife Rachel Weisz's name on it, before the clip abruptly cut out catching the morning studio hosts unawares. \nThis is a guy who recently said he'd rather \"slash his wrists\" than perform as Bond again. Clearly the reporter didn't do her research. Either that or she had a brief aneurysm. \n- NZ Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:33:54.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
