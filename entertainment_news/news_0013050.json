Happy Ever After's contributors have recommendations:\nA Noble Masquerade by Kristi Ann Hunter. Regency romance is one of my guilty pleasures, but add in a suspenseful plot, and you've just doubled the draw. This one fit the bill to a tee. A well-developed full-length novel debut, A Noble Masquerade is layered with subtle flirtation and charm. Moments of mortification give Miranda a fun sort of depth that makes her easy to identify with, as a reader. And Marlow ... Marlow ... *sighs* Yes, please! Marlow is superb. As a romantic hero, on every level and in every situation, he is Regency Hero Perfection. (But it is both gratifying and amusing when Miranda gets the chance to save his tail in a pinch!) If you're looking for an engaging Regency romance to sweep you away for a few hours, this is the book for you! An introductory prequel novella, A Lady of Esteem, is available, as well. Add this book to your shopping cart — and this author to your watch list! (Recommended by Serena Chase)\nAn Alaskan Wedding by Belle Calhoun. Grace is a big-city career girl on the fast track to success. Small-town sheriff Boone is a subtly alpha-male hero. From the moment Grace falls (er, literally) for Boone, you just know this is going to be fun. As Grace assimilates into small-community life under false pretenses, one little lie adds to another, until she can no longer deny the truth surprising her heart with unexpected love. Ah, this is a sweet one. Once you finish this novel, you'll be looking forward to learning who among the many eligible bachelors in Love, Alaska, will be the next groom to make his way down the aisle, by way of Belle Calhoun's pen. (Recommended by Serena Chase)\nRock Redemption (Photo: TKA Distribution)\nRock Redemption by Nalini Singh. Nalini Singh breathes life into her characters, making their stories real and impactful. Rock Redemption is an emotional story, and hero Noah's soul-deep anguish is so stark and real that I couldn't help but hurt for him. I just wanted to hug this guy. The minute I finish a Rock Kiss novel, I immediately want to reread it. I've already reread favorite passages of Rock Redemption and I'm sure I will be pulling it up on my e-reader many times. Kit and Noah's story is a poignant, intense friends-to-lovers story that proves love can conquer all. You could read Rock Redemption as a stand-alone, but I do feel that if you read Rock Addiction first, you'd feel more satisfied. If you are a rock star romance enthusiast, the Rock Kiss series isn't to be missed. (Recommended by Lea Franczak)\nThe Sword and the Song by C.E. Laureano, Fans of epic fantasy and married-couple romance will raise a goblet to the crowning final installment of this epic trilogy, The Song of Seare. Tensions remain high throughout the novel. With enemies closing in, Conor and Aine struggle to survive, apart, that they might someday know what it truly means to live as man and wife, together. Meanwhile, Eoghan protects Aine in Conor's absence, fighting his impossible love for his best friend's wife. Oh, the feels! And also swords, magic, battle, betrayal and hope. You absolutely need to read the other two books in this series first, but if you love Celtic-flavored adventure with a deep-rooted love story, you need to add this series to your TBR stack! (Recommended by Serena Chase)\nBinti by Nnedi Okorafor. Binti is a compact gem of adventure, bravery and other worlds. Nnedi Okorafor efficiently and effectively uses the short format to create a visual, suspenseful ride. And the heroine, Binti, invites us along to participate in her secret mission. From the start she is special and destined for greater things, but without knowing the tests that will challenge her resilience. As a result, her heroism and vulnerabilities grab our attention, holding tight until the end. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nThe Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin. Journeys abound in The Fifth Season. There is the literal journey from one place to another filled with danger and the unknown. There is journey to self-discovery and enlightenment that comes with dire consequences. There is journey through time where destruction and rebirth coexist. On this memorable ride, N.K. Jemisin pulls back the curtain and invites us into an epic fantasy. The world rages on its own rhythms and for its own purpose. Beautifully fleshed out in descriptive detail, this unique world plays an integral part with its occupants. And what a story! Whatever your state of mind at the beginning of The Fifth Season, I guarantee that by the end, you will not be in the same space. Because with Jemisin's artistry, we easily share in the discovery and the enormity of what is at stake. The central character makes all the difference in the world. She is a force to be reckoned with, strong, intelligent and determined — warms my heart. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nWhen We Were One by Zaji. Author Zaji debuts in the speculative fiction genre with When We Were One. Her story is a celebration of sisterhood and their connection with the physical world and beyond. As the first in the series, the story wonderfully gives us the boundaries that make up this world. With a culture and way of life in crisis, we feel the pain and threat that affect its people. Zaji's imaginative tale will spur us to think and to be entertained. Congratulations to Zaji on her first of hopefully many books. (Recommended by Michelle Monkou)\nMine by HelenKay Dimon. With hot love scenes, intrigue, betrayal and complex personal relationships, Mine has it all. I've been invested in this series since the beginning, and Mine kept me mesmerized. I even risked tripping and falling on my face and took it along to read while walking my dog! Mine can be read as a stand-alone. It's connected to the other books through the characters, but is set well outside of Washington and the exclusive Holton Woods club that provides the backdrop for the earlier stories. (Recommended by Lea Franczak)\nThe Name of the Game by Jennifer Dawson. Jennifer Dawson must have had a blast writing this story, because it is a hilarious, fast-paced romp. The characters are multidimensional and real, and the plot is enriched with a good serving of angst and emotion. I loved the relationship dynamic between the Donovan siblings; their good-natured banter had me hooting with laughter. In a nutshell, The Name of the Game has it all: wicked-smart snappy dialogue, hot love scenes, endearing characters and darn good fun. So, if you have a hankering for a feel-good opposites-attract contemporary romance, don't miss this one.
