While discussing his group's new album \" Made in the A.M. \", which will be their first without Zayn, Hazza said that the 22-year-old singer's departure didn't really change anything. \"I think it was obviously different, the process, because there was one less of us. But at the same time it didn't change,\" he shared. \"In terms of the writing of the album... it didn't change that much.... I think the focus over the last five years has always been the same... that we want to make the best record that we can. I think that didn't change in any way.\" Harry admitted that 1D's new music would be different without Zayn, but he didn't think that would be a big issue. \"Obviously the album sounds a little bit different because you're missing a voice that was there before,\" he explained. \"But we've very much grown stronger, probably through the realization that we all have the same goal for a lot of things.\" \"I think everyone was very much on the same page that we wanted to work really hard on the album and make something that we're proud of which, fortunately, we feel like we have done,\" he continued. Marking One Direction's fifth studio effort, \"Made in the A.M.\" is due out on November 13. The record will battle for the No. 1 spot on Billboard 200 and other albums charts against Justin Bieber 's \" Purpose \" that arrives on the same day. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:36.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
