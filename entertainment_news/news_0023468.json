The awards dinner was to pay tribute to the achievements of the Chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group, Dana Walden and Gary Newman. Michele, who had flown from the New Orleans set of “Scream Queens,” said she felt very grateful to be working with Walden and Newman on her second show with Fox, and that she didn’t know how to say thank you, so would give them a gift of a few songs. Danes described them as “the best team in the business.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:22:38.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
