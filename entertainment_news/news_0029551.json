But they won't be allowed to drive it on the road. \nAston Martin created 10 bespoke cars, dubbed the DB10, especially for the film, which debuts in the UK and Ireland on Monday. Related Content Daniel Craig: I'd rather 'slash my wrists' than play... \nThe luxury automaker plans to auction off one DB10 next year, but the car doesn't have the necessary road certifications for driving. That means the owner will simply have to place it in their collection and show it off to friends. \n\"Spectre\" marks a departure from past Bond films because the two main cars featured in the movie were created solely for the film and are not available to the public. \n\"This is the first time we created a car that was completely bespoke for Bond,\" said David Adams, a spokesperson at Aston Martin. \nThe villain's car, a Jaguar C-X75, is not for sale. \nThe hybrid concept car was unveiled at the 2010 Paris Motor Show, but never went into full production. \nOnly seven of these Jaguars were created for the film, and that's it. \nJaguar Land Rover also provided the film with 10 customized Land Rover Defenders and seven Range Rover Sport SVRs. \nSpecial features? \nBoth Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover were tight lipped about the special gadgets and features that were included in the Bond cars. \nBut they said that some of the design features of the DB10 and Jaguar C-X75 will be incorporated into their new models. \nAston Martin is preparing to launch its DB11 model next year that will be sold commercially. \nIt also recently began selling 150 special DB9 models with special Bond branding. The DB9 GT Bond Edition is priced at Â£165,000 ($253,000), and unlike the \"Spectre\" model, it is roadworthy. \nA history of Bond cars \nJames Bond has driven a number of cars over the years. In the Ian Fleming novels on which the films are based he drove a Bentley. In the movies, he's driven BMWs, a Lotus Esprit that went underwater (and which was eventually bought by Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk), a Toyota 2000GT sports car and even an AMC Hornet. \nAston Martin is the car brand with which the character has become most closely associated, however. Aston Martin's vintage DB5 famously reappeared in the most recent Bond film, \"Skyfall.\" \n\"Spectre\" will debut in U.S. theatres on November 6. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
