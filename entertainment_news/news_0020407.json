This annual presentation has attracted a larger audience for each of the past five years, an audience that has greatly enjoyed hearing examples of the creativity and humor of some of their fellow Coastal Senior College members. \n“We have all been continually impressed and amazed at what these lively minds have brought forth, and feel certain that you will, too,” said Jack Farlow, volunteer and instructor at Senior College. \nAs has been the case in past years, this event is co-sponsored by Coastal Senior College and the Camden Public Library. The event is free and all are welcome to attend. \n“We aim to benefit from the members’ different skills and experience,” said Muth. “We are our own audience and critics, and we enjoy this opportunity to read for the public!” \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
