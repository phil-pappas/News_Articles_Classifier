Wittry's friends and colleagues recently spent an evening presenting the music director and conductor of the Allentown Symphony Orchestra with a few purple cows of her own during the 20th anniversary Tribute and Benefit Dinner in her honor on Oct. 1.\nThe event began with a 5:30 p.m. reception and an auction of 17 violins painted by local artists. The celebration continued with a tribute on the stage of Miller Symphony Hall, followed by dinner in the Rodale Community Room, catered by Karen Hunter.\nAbout 175 were in attendance at the tribute, including past board presidents, patrons, supporters and dignitaries. About 125 remained for the dinner.\nThe night began in a way that was music to everyone's ears with the Painted Violin Auction raising nearly $10,000. Seventeen local artists donated their time and talents to transform retired, unplayable violins into works of art. The violins were displayed in the windows of Symphony Hall during September.\nParkland High School art teacher and artist Linda La Due presented Wittry with a specially painted violin as a keepsake from the event.\nAt the tribute, former symphony board member Michael Drabenstott served as the emcee and spoke about how Wittry has overseen a tremendous leap in the excellence of the orchestra during her tenure. She has kept her concerts fresh through innovative programming, showcasing the work of new composers as well as that of the great masters, he said.\n\"Diane is always looking for that unexpected twist for a concert to catch your attention,\" Drabenstott said. \"Like trumpets sounding from the balcony or flamenco dancers sashaying across the stage. She calls these 'purple cows.'\n\"Diane's determination to achieve the best, whether it is a purple cow, or guest artist, or a new timpani, is why we have experienced 20 years of great concerts here at Miller Symphony Hall.\"\nDrabenstott also mentioned how Wittry has inspired young conductors through her teaching and books, one of which, \"Beyond the Baton,\" published by Oxford University Press, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 2007.\nOther highlights of the event included a video by Stephanie Gardner honoring Wittry and the Allentown Symphony Orchestra.\nThis was followed by a presentation to musicians celebrating 20 years or more with the orchestra. Each was presented with a certificate of congratulations from state Sen. Pat Browne and a gold pin designating their years of service from the Allentown Symphony Association.\nAmong the musicians honored for their longevity were Linda Kistler, with 60 years of service, and Lee Walck and Milt Focht , each with 50 years.\nGovernment officials also showed their support for Wittry and gratitude for everything she has contributed through the years. Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski designated Oct. 1, 2015 as \"Diane Wittry Day\" in Allentown and presented her with a proclamation. Other proclamations were presented by State Reps. Pete Schweyer and Mike Schlossberg .\nWittry also received a framed print detailing her accomplishments with the Allentown Symphony Orchestra as well as a congratulatory letter from the President of the America League of Orchestras, Jesse Rosen.\nEvent sponsors included Donald and Maureen Frederick, William and Margaret Hecht, Alvin H. Butz, Joan Moran and William Fenza. Patrons included Peter and Carol Kern, and Missy and Sam Saxton .\nAmong the guests were Heather Rodale and Carl Barndt, Dr. Michael Badellino and Karen Badellino, Ruth and Charles Marcon, Joan Lardner Paul, Peter and Nancy Yenawine and David and Judy Mickenberg.\nJennifer Marangos is a freelance writer.
