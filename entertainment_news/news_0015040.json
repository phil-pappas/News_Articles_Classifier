The statute of limitations has expired in most of the cases and Cosby, now 78, has not been charged with any crimes. He has admitted to extramarital affairs, but denied he abused the women.\nThe Cosby Show , which remained popular in reruns, was yanked from television as a result of the controversy.\nAsked by View co-host Joy Behar what he thinks of the Ebony magazine cover, Warner replied, \"We really don't have enough time on this show to really talk about how I feel about that.\"\n\"Let's not forget that The Cosby Show was a sitcom and not a reality show,\" interrupted View panelist Raven-Symone , who appeared as a pre-schooler on The Cosby Show . \"Let's just remember that this was a sitcom. We had writers, things of that nature.\"\n\"That's a show that we're all very proud to have been on,\" Warner continued. \"[My former co-star] Keshia Knight Pulliam said a really interesting thing in that her perspective is the legacy cannot be taken away because all of the good that that show has done cannot be taken away. The generation of people of color who have chosen to go to college because they watched that show and because they watched [its spinoff] {i:A Different World }, you can't take that away.\"\nLike Us on Facebook for more stories from UPI.com Related UPI Stories Bill Murray's Netflix special to air Dec. 4 Stephen Fry is leaving British panel show 'QI' Harry Connick Jr. to host daytime entertainment show 'Harry' in 2016 Donald Trump to host 'Saturday Night Live' on Nov. 7", "external_links": ["https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVB3vE-WYTo", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-17T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:17:39.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
