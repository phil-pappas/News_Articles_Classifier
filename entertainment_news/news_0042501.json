Johnny Depp gives a layered, chilling, disturbing performance as Boston mob boss James “Whitey” Bulger in this gripping and brutal crime saga. Yet director Scott Cooper wants to tell more than the story of Bulger’s rise and fall; the film is also about FBI agent John Connolly (a terrific Joel Edgerton), who thinks he can leverage his childhood friendship with the Bulgers into success for himself. While the general arc of the story is familiar gangster-film, it’s the getting there that’s the thrill, and nearly all of the performances – especially Depp’s – are strong. *** ½ \"A Brilliant Young Mind\": (drama, not rated, 111 minutes, reviewed by Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times). One of the purest, most tender and most beautiful performances of the year comes from Sally Hawkins as the loving single mother of an off-the-charts brilliant teenager incapable of expressing love. It's the best thing in a conventional but well-crafted story of a boy unlikely ever to have a normal social life. *** \"Everest\": (adventure-Drama-Thriller, PG-13, 121 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, \"Everest\" is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained. *** \"Grandma\": (comedy, R, 80 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Lily Tomlin is almost certain to win a best actress nomination for playing a feminist helping her granddaughter scrape up the money for an abortion. It's a slim one-day road movie filled with big laugh lines, but saturated with regret, grief and separation. It's the saddest comedy of the year. ***½ “Hotel Transylvania 2”: (animated, PG, 87 minutes, reviewed by Rick Bentley, The Fresno Bee). The spookiest thing about this sequel is how much funnier, colorful and more original it is this second time around. With Adam Sandler still voicing Dracula, he’s a blood-drinker worried whether his grandson will sprout fangs and planning to scare the monster into the infant. Director Genndy Tartakovsy has kicked up the energy and the script by Sandler and Robert Smigel blends some very funny slapstick comedy with some equally smart references for horror film fan aficionados. *** \"Inside Out\": (animated adventure, PG, 93 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). The world of an 11-year-old girl is seen through the emotions in her head – Joy, Sadness, Disgust and the like – in a bold, gorgeous instant classic from Disney Pixar that deserves an Academy Award nomination for best picture. **** \"The Intern\": (comedy, PG-13, 121 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Despite the high-concept premise – retired exec (Robert De Niro) interns for e-commerce mogul (Anne Hathaway) –\"The Intern\" is a lovely comfort movie, nestled softly in a cynicism-free zone. De Niro and Hathaway mesh in terrific fashion and deliver utterly charming performances. ***½ \"The Martian\": (sci-fi adventure, PG-13, 141 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). A visual stunner, \"The Martian\" also is a hopeful love letter to science and math, American resolve, the power of friendship and international unity. And it features Matt Damon giving one of his best performances as a botanist stranded on Mars and using all his ingenuity to establish communications and stay alive. ***½ “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials” (sci-fi action, PG-13, 131 minutes, reviewed by Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service). In this sequel about Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) and friends who have been subjects in experimental scientific trials, director Wes Ball puts the pedal to the floor in terms of thematics, scope and bombast — everything is faster, bigger and scarier. Thomas quickly breaks the crew out into the wasteland of The Scorch in hopes of finding a resistance army. While it feels like relentless running in circles, the sequences are well-executed and it’s a winning cast of young actors. **½ “Minions”: (animated, PG, 104 minutes, reviewed by Colin Covert, Star Tribune). In the current crop of follow-up films, few will delight 7-year-olds like “Minions.” These deferential little yellow creatures from the “Despicable Me” franchise, looking like Twinkies cross-bred with gelatin pill capsules, are appealing and adorable with their infantilized sense of humor, babbling Euro-gibberish and portraits of most adults as pushy supervisors. This film starts with the Minions’ evolution and quickly goes through history to 1968, where they are recruited as servants at a villains convention. The film is deliberately silly but never shoddy. *** \"Pawn Sacrifice\": (drama, PG-13, 116 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Tobey Maguire gives the performance of his career in an enthralling piece of mainstream entertainment that captures the essence of chess champion Bobby Fischer's mad genius, perfectly re-creates the tenor of the times AND works as a legit sports movie. **** \"Sicario\": (crime action, R, 121 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). In examining the dominance of drugs in our culture, Denis Villeneuve's complex, sometimes sickeningly violent \"Sicario\" mixes big-picture issues, grindhouse pulp and pure, rough entertainment, bolstered by an excellent ensemble cast led by Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin. This is one of the best movies of the year. **** \"Sleeping With Other People\": (comedy, R, 95 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). In one of my favorite rom-coms in recent memory, Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie play attractive, noncommittal people who expend an awful lot of emotional energy on remaining friends even though it's perfectly obvious they should be together. After all the twisted hard-R shenanigans, you just want to give them all a hug and thank 'em for sharing a slice of their lives. ***½ \"The Visit\": (horror, PG-13, 94 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Alas, the latest would-be comeback film from M. Night Shyamalan is a dopey, only mildly chilling, uneasy mix of horror and dark comedy, scoring few points in either category. Two teens spend a week with their estranged grandparents, only to discover something seems just a little ... off about them. *½ \"A Walk in the Woods\": (comedy, R, 98 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Two former movie golden boys finally share the big screen – and they're stuck in a middling sitcom. Robert Redford stars as a travel writer hobbling his way down the Appalachian Trail with his out-of-shape friend (Nick Nolte), and the result is an amiable, lightweight and thoroughly predictable buddy movie. ** Also showing Cape Cinema: 35 Hope Lane, Dennis: \"Grandma\" and \"A Brilliant Mind,\" Friday through Thursday. www.capecinema.com . 508-385-2503.
