WATCH: Our interview with writer David Tristram here . \nGill said she hoped Doreen’s success could spur other film-makers on to featuring the Black Country more . \n“It’s not enough to just have something like Peaky Blinders,” she said. “And even for that the casting is done elsewhere. \n“There’s so much talent in the West Midlands.” \n“Doreen-mania seems to be sweeping everywhere.” \nThose were the words of scriptwriter David Tristram, the man who created the fictional phenomenon Doreen, who is taking the Black Country by storm. \nThe character, played by Cheslyn Hay actor Gill Jordan, is the star of Doreen – The Movie, which had its premiere at Wolverhampton’s Light House Cinema on Saturday night. \nA packed crowd lapped up the feature-length film following the antics of Doreen, who rose to fame after a YouTube video saw her diagnose herself with ‘lazy cow syndrome’. Steve Bull, far left, and star of Doreen, Gill Jordan, centre right, join cast and crew at the premiere in Wolverhampton \nOne of those there on the night was Wolves goalscoring legend Steve Bull, who made a cameo in the movie alongside another of the Black Country’s favourite sons Robert Plant. \nBully said: “It was lovely being involved, but a bit nerve-wracking. I’ve done a few bits on TV, but this felt a bit more natural for me as it’s all about where I’m from. \n“I think people from the Black Country will love the film and it’s great to hear all the Black Country accents. It’s our unique language and I don’t think you can beat it.” \nMarried mum-of-three Mrs Jordan, 47, said: “It’s amazing – you couldn’t imagine this happening when we started. I think the humour of it attracts people to Doreen and it’s a refreshing change from what people are used to.” Gill Jordan and Steve Bull \nThe role of Doreen was written specially for Mrs Jordan, by playwright and film-maker David Tristram, who said he was overwhelmed by the response to the character. \n“Doreen-mania seems to be sweeping everywhere and it’s great,” he said. “It’s fantastic for the Black Country and people can be proud to hear the Black Country accents and witness the sense of humour on the big screen.” \nMr Tristram, who was born in Quarry Bank, said he felt a combination of ‘excitement and sheer terror’ ahead of the film’s screening. \nCriticism has been levelled at Doreen for painting Black Country folk in a poor light, but Mr Tristram dismissed any negative comments. \n“I think people who criticise Doreen are missing the point. The overwhelming reaction to this is people loving it,” said Mr Tristram. “It’s not stereotyping – it’s just a character I’ve created.” \nInitially, a four-minute clip of Doreen was posted online and has since been viewed more than 1.4 million times. That has led to two stage shows and an autobiography.
