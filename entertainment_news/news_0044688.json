According to the outlet, doctors told his family and friends that an undetermined amount of damage to his body would be permanent despite the rehabilitation. The rehabilitation will reportedly be more than just physical therapy. Sources told the outlet that physical, speech and other therapists will work with the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star for the foreseeable future. Khloe Kardashian will reportedly stay with him throughout the ordeal including the therapy. Multiple sources told the website that the 31-year-old reality TV star stayed by his bedside and wanted to see this through. Khloe has not commented either on her future relationship with Lamar or on how her action would affect her relationship with James Harden . As previously reported, Khloe is still legally married to Lamar. Though she finalized her divorce in July, a judge hasn't signed the divorce papers yet. Consequently, Khloe is in charge of making the medical decisions while Lamar remains in critical conditions. Lamar was found unconscious with \"mucus-type liquid coming out of his nose and mouth\" at a brothel in Pahrump, Nevada on Tuesday afternoon, October 13. A source claimed to have been told by doctors that \" cocaine and opiates \" were found in his system. Lamar's hospitalization is currently investigated by Nye County Sheriff's Officials for the alleged drug abuse. Three days after he was admitted to a Las Vegas hospital, Lamar regained consciousness . \"He opened his eyes and made a sound,\" said a source, adding that he's able to say, \"Hi,\" to Khloe and, \"Good morning,\" to his doctor. Lamar \"has been taken completely off the ventilator \" but is \"still wearing an oxygen mask to increase his oxygen levels.\" As of Sunday, he was able to leave his hospital bed and move to a chair with assistance. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:49:23.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
