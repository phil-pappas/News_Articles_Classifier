And now he has set his sights on the Black Country Living Museum. \nTop of his agenda is transforming the Tipton Road site into more of a ‘complete experience’ that throws visitors back into a different era. \nThe Dudley College principal has been on the board of trustees at the Black Country Living Museum for 18 months and is now stepping up to replace John Hughes as chairman. \nWhile respecting the progress made under his predecessor, who has been in the role since 2006, Mr Williams has set his sights on expanding the reach of the iconic site. \nEarlier this year the museum’s tramway reopened for business after 18 months out of action. \nThe museum has also created a new entrance to welcome the 60,000 school children who visit the attraction every year, as well as to help cut queues. Crowds at the museum. \nThe new boss says it is a transformational and exciting phase in the museum’s history. \nHe adds: “The trams are up and running. They have done hundreds of miles over the summer and everyone loves them. \n“There is a steam forge hammer which is currently being restored for the canal arm. It will be the only one in the Black Country. \n“More importantly we are working on the masterplan for the site. The site is good but there are opportunities to make it better.” \nThe masterplan is intended to be a 10-year forward plan to preserve the museum’s future. \nAt Mr Hughes’ final meeting as chair, trustees discussed how they could ‘reimagine’ the site to give visitors a more authentic experience. \nThe museum is now a major partner of Arts Council England which means it can attract greater funding – hence the increased ambition. \nIt comes as the museum was turned into a film set this week, as BBC drama Peaky Blinders, starring Cillian Murphy, was shot there. \nMr Williams says the extra exposure will only improve the museum’s reputation. He adds: “The site has been put together by an acquisition of assets to make our collection. Weaved through that is the story of the industrial heritage of the Black Country. Cillian Murphy on set filming for the Peaky Blinders \n“The board think it could be an even more immersive experience when people come and visit. It can give an even stronger impression of ‘black by day and red by night.’ \n“I think we can bring together some of our assets so they are better connected and get that feeling of steam, dirt and grime so it is really in your face as you go through.” The new chairman has set his sights of linking up further with Dudley Canal Trust and Dudley Zoo and also wants to build on the relationship with his primary employer. \n“The museum offers my students great opportunities,” he says. “We work on the museum’s marketing and some of our students take part in our evening performances here.
