The news came in the wake of official confirmation released by E! that \" I Am Cait \" is renewed for season 2. A source revealed in the new issue of Us Weekly that publishers have been lining up to secure a book deal with the Olympian turned reality star. \"They want her to do a memoir,\" said the source. However, there have yet any further details about the books offer. Writing a book, in fact, is not something new for 65-year-old Caitlyn. Prior to transitioning into a woman, she penned \"Decathlon Challenge\" back in 1977 and the 1996 self-help guide \"Finding the Champion Within.\" In addition to \"I Am Cait\", a representative for Caitlyn has confirmed earlier this week that the reality personality would be doing motivational speeches again. The five-city speaking tour, titled \"Up Close and Personal,\" is set to be kicked off in February. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:46:21.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
