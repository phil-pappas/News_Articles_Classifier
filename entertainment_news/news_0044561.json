Mikells has been named CFO of Diageo PLC , a London-based alcohol company whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal, Tanqueray and Guinness.\nShe came to Xerox in May 2013, from security company ADT Corp., where she had worked as the chief financial officer for less than a year. Before that, she spent just more than a year as CFO of Nalco Holding Co. and more than 15 years at United Airlines in various management and executive roles, including CFO.\nThe Connecticut-based printing and business process outsourcing giant will report its quarterly earnings later this month. It last reported earnings in July, when CEO Ursula Burns told investors that Xerox would cut jobs and pull back on its government health care strategy after yet another year-over-year decline in revenues and profits.\nMikells' last day at Xerox will be Oct. 31. She begins at Diageo Nov. 9. Xerox officials plan to conduct an external search for her replacement. Leslie Varon, vice president of Investor Relations, will take over CFO duties in the interim.\nBDSHARP@DemocratandChronicle.com", "external_links": ["http://news.xerox.com/news/Xerox-announces-CFO-transition", "http://www.diageo.com/en-us/newsmedia/pages/resource.aspx?resourceid=2845"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:34:35.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
