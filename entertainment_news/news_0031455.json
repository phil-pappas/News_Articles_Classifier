(PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nTelling the story of how he built one of the nation’s largest African-American-owned business organizations from almost nothing, entrepreneurial pioneer John W. Barfield publishes his memoir, co-written by Anthony Neely, titled “Starting from Scratch: The Humble Beginnings of a Two-Billion-Dollar Enterprise” (published by WestBow Press).\nBarfield began his career as a janitor making $1.75 an hour, but he built a building maintenance business so profitable that International Telephone & Telegraph (now ITT Corporation) outbid three other corporate giants to buy it in 1969. Barfield then developed the Barfield Companies into a much-admired organization comprising manufacturing and service companies. Today Barfield’s most successful company, the Bartech Group Inc ., is a well-established multimillion-dollar corporation. Bartech bills clients more than $2 billion annually for its global workforce management services.\nBarfield’s success, driven by his integrity and high ethical standards, built confidence in minority supplier programs that are now standard throughout American industry. “Starting from Scratch” highlights practical and spiritual principles that were integral to Barfield’s six decades as a successful entrepreneur – and which anyone can apply for similar success in business and life. Barfield and Neely hope their new book will inspire current and aspiring entrepreneurs with its detailed guidelines on discovering a niche market, managing crises and delivering more than customers and employees expect.\nThe book is available at http://www.johnwbarfield.com\n“Starting from Scratch”\nBy John W.
