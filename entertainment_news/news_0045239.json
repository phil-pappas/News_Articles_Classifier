This year's contest drew nearly 1,000 ultimate guys who are devoted to giving back and seamlessly balancing career, relationships and community. Boniface, 36, left a lucrative career in banking to train as a firefighter and paramedic after the events of September 11, which resulted in the deaths of two of his close friends. Boniface has been a full-time firefighter for almost four years now, and despite taking a 50 percent pay cut, he says his job satisfaction soared. \"In this job, I've laughed the hardest, I've cried the hardest, and I've been the most satisfied. I show up on the worst day of people's lives and try to make things better. I sleep better knowing I'm helping people.\" Like Boniface, the fragrance is a representation of what it means to be the Ultimate Guy, a man who inspires, who demonstrates strength every day, and who always perseveres. The MANKIND by Kenneth Cole fragrance is available for $74 at Macy's and Macys.com. \"The MANKIND fragrance is designed for the guy with substance, determination, and of course, the ultimate sense of style,\" said Kenneth Cole, Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. \"This man understands the importance of having balance in his life and looks to achieve that on all levels. Congratulations Tim. Thank you for inspiring and being part of the evolution.\" Last year's winner, US Army veteran and double amputee Noah Galloway, went on to become the face of MANKIND Ultimate . In the campaign, Noah is depicted as the ultimate man through an impactful portrait and a collage that show how he got to where he is today. He went on to compete on ABC's Dancing with the Stars . \nABOUT KENNETH COLE PRODUCTIONS, INC.: \nKenneth Cole is an American designer, social activist, and visionary who believes business and philanthropy are interdependent.
