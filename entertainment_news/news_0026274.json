Its biggest seller is Bud Light, the world's third most popular beer , which edges out its more calorific brother, Budweiser, in fourth place. SAB Miller's flagship brew is Miller Lite , which is the world's 15th most popular beer, reports CNN Money.\nThe blockbuster deal would create a suds monolith that would have the following brands rattling around in in one ginormous, global cooler: Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite, Miller High Life, Coors, Coors Light, Corona, Michelob, Busch, Stella Artois, Becks, Peroni, Hoegaarden, Grolsch, Icehouse, Keystone, Milwaukee’s Best, Blue Moon, Foster’s, Pilsner Urquell, and, well, you get the idea.\nAB InBev will pay $67.59 per share for the maker of Miller Lite, Peroni and Pilsner Urquell. roughly 50 percent over SABMiller share price before the acquisition rumors started, um, brewing.\nThe biggest beer deal in history still has to be approved by regulators, but SABMiller's board members have indicated they will recommend the offer to shareholders. So yes, it won't be long before anytime you order a beer, it will likely be coming from the same multi-billion dollar, global conglomerate.
