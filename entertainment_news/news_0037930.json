Distinguished piano soloist Christopher O’Riley joins the SMSO for the concerto. \nThe lively, brief overture — a little less than five minutes long — sets a tone for the concerto much the same way it does for the “Marriage of Figaro” opera. The opera and the 22nd piano concerto were written almost simultaneously in 1785-86, and critics have often observed that the concerto has certain characteristics of an opera. \nO’Riley finds what he calls “operatic resonances” in the work, and he says Mozart left plenty of open spaces for pianists to get creative. \n“There are lots of opportunities for improvisation and filigree ornamentation throughout the piece,” he says by telephone while driving through rural Montana. \nMost significantly, Mozart did not leave behind any suggested cadenzas — those places where the orchestra falls silent while the soloist goes off on an extended unaccompanied run. Although several later composers wrote tremendous cadenzas for use in this concerto, O’Riley elects to make up his own. \nHe carries the credentials to qualify him for the task. Over the last two decades, he’s become an A-list pianist as a prolific recording and touring artist. He’s also the host of the PBS Television/NPR Radio program “From the Top.” \nHis repertoire often features modernists such as Scriabin and Stravinsky, and O’Riley has an abiding interest in contemporary rock. In duo settings with cellist Matt Haimovitz, he initiated a series called “Shuffle.Play.Listen.,” which finds them performing works by bands including Blonde Redhead and Cocteau Twins. \nHowever, he’s no stranger to the more canonical Mozart, and he’s played this concerto on and off for 20 years. His cadenzas reflect this familiarity. \n“I’ve thought about this piece a lot, and I’ve come up with some things — moments of invention — that work rather well, and sound idiomatic,” O’Riley says. “They sound like they could have been written by Mozart. I try to work in some material that the orchestra plays but that I don’t get to play in the concerto.” \nNot needing to work at Mozart’s hectic pace, a comfortable Dvorák composed his eighth symphony while relaxing in the Bohemian countryside in 1889. \n“He’d just won a big award from the Austrian government, and I’m sure he was feeling pretty good about life and about his career choices and about the way his music was being received,” Fountain says. \nIndeed, Dvorák was so confident that he was bold enough to get past the minor criticism that his friend Brahms offered about the symphony — that it was a series of beautiful details but without sufficient central foundation. History has sided with Dvorák, and the work has become nearly as beloved as his celebrated “New World” symphony that followed it. \nThe Symphony No. 8 is imbued with nature sounds and bird calls, mostly rendered by wind instruments. Melodies spring up almost ceaselessly throughout the piece, one after another, with effervescent freshness. \n“We can hear his joy and satisfaction,” Fountain says. “The satisfaction of being at one with the universe. It’s such a lovely thing to be a part of for 30 minutes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:07:08.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
