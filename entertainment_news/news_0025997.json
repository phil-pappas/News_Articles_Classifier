All times local.\n12:15 p.m.\nThe United Nations refugee agency believes Slovenia has the capacity to accept some 7,000 migrants coming to the country on their way toward Western Europe.\nUNHCR spokeswoman Caroline Van Buren said at Slovenia's border with Croatia Saturday that \"all is going well\" as the first groups of migrants started arriving to the small Alpine nation.\nThe flow has turned to Slovenia after Hungary sealed its border with Croatia for migrants shortly after midnight Friday. Most of the people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia want to reach rich EU nations such as Germany.\nSlovenia has said it will accept migrants as long as Austria and Germany keep their borders open. Several hundred people have come so far with more expected later Saturday.\n___\n12:05 p.m.\nHungary says it has temporarily reinstated border controls at its frontiers with Slovenia to prevent migrants from entering the county in an unrestricted manner.\nThe measure announced Saturday came hours after Hungary closed off its borders with Croatia, from where thousands of migrants a day were entering. Both Slovenia and Hungary are part of the European Union 's Schengen zone of border free travel.\nSince Croatia said it would start sending migrants to the border with Slovenia, Hungary fears they could try to cross into Hungary from Slovenia on their way to Germany and other European destinations.\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in a statement that the government was defending Hungary and its citizens from the \"mass wave of unidentified, uncontrolled migrants.\"\n___\n11:55 a.m.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says she won't offer \"false solutions\" to the migrant crisis as she faces pressure to do more to limit the influx.\nMerkel told Saturday's edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Germany can control its borders but not close them completely — \"that wouldn't even succeed with a fence, as the example of Hungary shows.\"\nThousands of new arrivals a day have been stretching Germany's capacity to house refugees and other migrants. But Merkel said she won't promise \"false solutions\" because they wouldn't even hold for two weeks and would create bigger disappointment that the problem hasn't been resolved.\nMerkel added: \"I am working with all my power for sustainable solutions, and they don't depend on us Germans alone and will take time.\"\n___\n11:25 a.m.\nTurkey's state-run news agency says 12 migrants have drowned after their boat sank off the Turkish coast in the Aegean sea.\nThe Anadolu Agency says the Turkish Coast Guard on Saturday rescued 25 other migrants from the sea.\nThe group was trying to reach the island the Greek island of Lesbos — an entry point for a majority of migrants making the journey from the nearby Turkish coast.\nThere was no immediate information of the nationalities of the migrants.\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nAmnesty International has called European Union leaders to put refugee rights above concerns to protect their borders.\nAmnesty's call Saturday came a day before German Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to hold talks with Turkish officials on an EU plan that would give concession to Turkey in exchange for stemming the flow of migrants into EU countries.\nOfficials say the concessions would include an aid package, easier access to EU visas for Turkish citizens and speed-up EU membership talks.\nAmnesty said the EU should be looking for ways to \"offer safe and legal routes to refugees to reach Europe.\"\nThe group said: \"A deal premised on keeping refugees in Turkey fundamentally ignores both the challenges they face there and the obvious need for the EU to offer protection.\"\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nThe first groups of migrants have reached Slovenia's border, arriving from Croatia on buses. Migrants hoping to reach western Europe have turned that way after Hungary sealed off its territory for them.\nSlovenian police say five buses carrying about 300 migrants arrived Saturday to the border checkpoint at Petisovci. Spokeswoman Suzana Raus says migrants will be transferred to a migrant center near the border with Austria after they pass a registration procedure.\nMost migrants are expected to move on from Slovenia to Austria and further on to Germany and other more prosperous countries of Western Europe.\nSlovenia, a nation of 2 million, has said it wants to control the number of people coming to its territory from Croatia. It has beefed up border police and suspended regular train traffic with Croatia.\n___\n9:45 a.m.\nCroatia's president has demanded strict control over the country's border with Serbia after Hungary closed its own border with Croatia to migrants hoping to reach Western Europe.\nKolinda Grabar Kitarovic late Friday urged the government to direct all migrant traffic to official border crossings rather than allow them to enter through illegal routes.\nSome 180,000 people have passed through Croatia since mid-September. The country was expected to redirect the migrant flow to Slovenia.\nGrabar Kitarovic says Croatia should only allow in only the migrants who are certain to leave the country, signaling fears that thousands of migrants could get stuck in Croatia if Slovenia slows down the flow.\n___\n9:20 a.m.\nThousands of migrants are pouring into Croatia from Serbia as the influx of people hoping to reach Western Europe continued despite Hungary's decision to block them from its territory.\nShortly after midnight Friday, Hungarian police in full gear pulled a barbed-wire fence over a passage on the Croatian border where some 140,000 migrants have passed since mid-September.\nCroatia has said it will now redirect the migrants toward Slovenia, its other neighbor. First groups are expected to arrive at the border later on Saturday.\nSlovenia has suspended regular train traffic with Croatia in anticipation of the influx.\nAuthorities in Slovenia have said they would accept controlled numbers of migrants as long as its neighbors Austria and Germany keep their borders open. Slovenia's national security council meets on the issue Saturday.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:47:25.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
