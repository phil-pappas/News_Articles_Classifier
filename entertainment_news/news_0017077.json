The new 'classic' episodes are based on albums recorded by the original cast in 1960s\nThe whole ethos of this project is to recreate Thunderbirds exactly as it was back in 1965.\nA few concessions to technology in terms of the way we're making it... but what appears on screen must look like it could have been made by the team back in the 60s.\n– Stephen La Riviere, Producer/Director, Thunderbirds 1965 From the Himalayas to the Pacific, everything's filmed under one roof.\nThe team are filming at the exact location - on the Slough Trading Estate - where Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's team produced the hit shows in the 60s.\nPuppets like Scott Tracy have been faithfully recreated The techniques might not seem the most sophisticated, but the results speak for themselves...\nWatch below to see Thunderbird 1 landing, and how a combination of high-speed filming and practical effects can produce stunning results...\nPlay video Fans from across the world contributed money to fund the filming.\nIt's been a fantastic level of support we've had.\nWe originally budgeted and asked for the funds to produce one episode, and within a few days it was it was really apparent that people were very much behind this, and we going to be having to make the entire three episodes that were possible to make\n– Andrew T Smith, Associate Producer Puppet maker Barry Davies, from Ferndale, has the job of recreating the stars of the show.\nYou get so much CGI on television these days - it's very good - but these are physical things, and people still like to see physical things!\nThey are bit quirky, they are a bit jerky! And that's part of the charm!\"\n– Barry Davies, puppet maker Brains - the inventor behind the amazing Thunderbirds machines The characters - including the Tracy brothers of International Rescue, Lady Penelope and the villainous Hood - have been faithfully recreated for the episodes.\nLady Penelope in peril, in a scene from 'The Abominable Snowman' We have the original voices as well, so I'm really hoping that when people watch this thing, they get the disk or they see the screening we do, that they'll look at it and go 'this is Thunderbirds', it's like seeing a new episode that we haven't seen before.\n– Justin T Lee, visual effects Gerry Anderson's son Jamie says his late father would have been impressed with the project.\nHe did say how difficult the puppets were to work with and how difficult the whole production was and how expensive it was, so he would definitely think that everyone here was a bit crazy to be going down this route!\nBut I think I think seeing the rushes come together and these early scenes cut together and how well it's coming across on camera, I think he would be really honoured!\n– Jamie Anderson This isn't the first Thunderbirds revival. Only this year, a CGI- enhanced remake launched on ITV.\nBut for this crew - fans and filmmakers alike - this is their way of paying tribute to the pioneering team behind the show fifty years ago, and their high tech vision of the future.\nWatch the full report from Mike Griffiths below:\nPlay video More: Original Lady Penelope puppet goes under the hammer Last updated Wed 30 Sep 2015 Entertainment South Wales", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/mrmikegriffiths"], "published": "2015-09-29T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:15:08.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
