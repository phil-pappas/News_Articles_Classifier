Finally however - I am on the receiving end and (to put it mildly) it sucks!\nA little while back I accidently uploaded R1000 worth of airtime to my phone through my banking app. All I needed was R100 to keep me going until my next months contract top up but with arms full of kiddies and a lap full of food, using my one hand and one eye to do the upload was ... regrettable.\nThe next day on realising my error I promptly called my bank to be told to call my service provider about the error - to be told that the oopsie could not be reversed but that I shouldn't worry as the airtime will be available - until it gets used up.\nFast forward one month later, with a positive balance of +R800 still available, all of a sudden... crickets. Gone baby, gone. No more pretty, positive balance.\nAnd there I was, another victim of the depleting data and airtime scandal that was recently publicised on most news networks.\nOn trying to call my Main Telecommunications Network (hint hint) the first frustration I discovered was finding an actual real life, live person to have conversation with. Followed by finding a supervisor or manager that had a line that didn't drop your call prior to it being answered.\nThereafter - the many attempts to find email addresses that were worth a damn mailing and the serious lack of follow up by those on the receiving end of those mails.\nFrustrated. Angry. Let down. Is this what hundreds of South Africans have to go through daily? And not only with communication providers but within business and municipal stations?\nIt's sad really. Somewhat criminal is it not?\nWhen is enough, really enough? Can more not be done in terms of providing law and auditing of firms that are paid to provide a service whether it be business or municipal?\nI still want answers, but being 1 month in, I don't hold much hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:30:42.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
