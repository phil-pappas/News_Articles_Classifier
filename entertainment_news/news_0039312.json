The district has hired a consulting firm to study the possibility of creating a free city-wide wireless network. It would build on existing resources, including libraries, schools and other public buildings, then look to fill in gaps.\nThe report will show what resources currently exist, overlaid on a map with socioeconomic data on poverty and where students live. It will also consider funding sources for the project.\nThe district is spending $38,500 on the project and expects a report by the end of the year. The firm, Millennium Strategies, is based in New Jersey.\nAccording to the 2013 American Communities Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, about 21 percent of Rochester residents do not have Internet access. That is about the same as Buffalo and Syracuse as well as the national average.\nJMURPHY7@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/publications/2013.html", "http://www.boarddocs.com/ny/rochny/Board.nsf/files/A29J8K4A7449/%24file/Resolution%20238%20-%20Executive%20Summary%20Citywide%20Wi-Fi%20Feasibility%20Study%20-%20Sept%202015.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:22:18.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
