And what is billed as the first tournament for the sport in Upstate New York is happening this weekend at the Tuttle North Gym on The College at Brockport campus. The Western New York Wreckers are playing host in a four-team field from the United States and Canada.\nFounded in 2013, the Wreckers began competitive play last year. Team members have included those with disabilities including spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and spina bifida. The current, 10-person roster, including one woman, hails almost exclusively from Rochester. Players are classified numerically on a scale of 0.5 to 3.5 based on degree of disability, and teams can only have 8 points on the field at one time.\n\"It's a great sport,\" said Wreckers co-founder and president Chris Hilderbrant. \"It's fast. It's loud. It's hard hitting. It's high scoring. ... You are crashing into each other. It is metal on metal, hammering.\"\nFor more information go to www.Facebook.com/WNYWreckers or email WNYWreckers@gmail.com.\nBDSHARP@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.Facebook.com/WNYWreckers"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:11:43.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
