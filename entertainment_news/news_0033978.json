Guest performer Peter Neils will open the 7:30 p.m. show. \nSinger/songwriter Mallett is one of America’s true, original troubadours. In a career spanning five decades, he has evolved quite a bit in concert, thanks to his prolific songwriting. \n\"By the time that I was 26 or 27, I was singing all my own songs,” he said. \nMallett has recorded 14 albums. Noel Paul Stookey produced Mallett’s first three albums in the 1970s and helped to bring his tune, “The Garden Song,” to the attention of influential folksinger Pete Seeger, who included it on his 1979 album “Circles And Seasons.” It has become an American folk classic, the first of several hundred covers of his songs. \nMallett has performed in clubs, concert halls and festivals across the United States, Canada and Europe. After touring the folk circuit for 10 years and moving to Nashville in the late 1980s, he continued to record and write new songs. Eventually, his heart and family brought him home to Sebec, and it is from there that some of his very strongest songs have originated. \nMallet has appeared on numerous broadcasts, including public radio’s “A Prairie Home Companion.” His carefully written, poetic body of work has provided material for an eclectic list of artists that includes Alison Krauss, Pete Seeger, Hal Ketchum, Emmylou Harris, John Denver and the Muppets. \nNeils performing career also began more than four decades ago; in the late 1960s, he performed with Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie in support of the Hudson River Sloop Project. performing career also began more than has been picking up steam in recent years with the success of his first CD release, “Desert Dreams,” last summer. He was one of the first artists to record in Camden’s new Hearstudios and one of the studio’s first projects to see release. \nNeils has and continues to work on a variety of social issues including nuclear power and disarmament, river dam removal in the American Southwest, public lands defense and education, migrant solidarity and actions to stop the war economy. He primarily will perform original songs he has written about these struggles and other experiences, his 30 years spent in Appleton as a homesteader. With a sharp eye on the important details of a Neils will be accompanied on stage by talented Midcoast musicians Vince Gabriel on guitar and Lynne Frey on bass. \nBoth artists will be selling their most recent CD releases at the concert. Tickets are $23 in advance, available at the Camden Town Office between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. weekdays and online at camdenoperahouse.com ; and $25 at the door. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
