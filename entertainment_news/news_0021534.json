The veterans joined them on the ice for the start of Buffalo Sabres training camp on Sept. 18. Now, nearly a full month later, the American Hockey League season begins for the Rochester Americans. The puck drops on the Amerks’ 60th anniversary season at 7:05 p.m. on Oct. 9.\nAfter finishing 14th in the 15-team Western Conference a year ago, expectations are high for an entertaining team and a playoff run that stretches at least into May.\nNow, however, they’re in the midst of an extreme drought. The Amerks haven’t won a playoff series since 2004-05.Deep playoff runs were a rite of spring in Rochester through the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1982-83 and 1999-2000, the Amerks played in the Calder Cup finals nine times in 18 years, winning it all in 1982-83 and 1995-96.\nHigh-scoring centerman Cal O’Reilly, a veteran of 10 pro seasons, was signed in July to be the focal point of the Amerks attack. He was named captain by coach Randy Cunneyworth on Oct. 8.\n“I’ve been through a lot of teams, I’ve been through a lot in my career,” O’Reilly said. “I want to win. I want to do what I can to help this team win.”\nHere’s a quick look at the 2015-16 Amerks:\nAndrey Makarov, #1\nAndrey Makarov (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nGoalie\nHeight/weight: 6-1/193.\nAge: 22.\nThe effervescent third-year goaltender is looking to establish himself as a legitimate NHL prospect. He played a big part in the playoff push in 2013-14 but wasn’t as consistent last season, his first full year in the AHL. Relies on quickness and athleticism. Won silver and bronze medals in World Junior Championship with Russia.\nJosh Chapman, #2\nJosh Chapman (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nDefense\nHeight/weight: 6-4/214.\nAge: 20.\nInvited to the Sabres development camp in July, where he earned an AHL/ECHL contract. Physicality is his game. To be effective, he must bounce bodies and be a pain to play against, and he knows it. Played three full seasons with Sarnia in the Ontario Hockey League. His job in the playoffs last spring: Make life miserable for Connor McDavid.\nChad Ruhwedel, #5\nChad Ruhwedel. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nDefense\nHeight/weight: 5-11/182.\nAge: 25.\nA terrific skater with very good puck skills. Coming off a strong season when he produced 10 goals, 26 assists and 36 points in 72 games. His teammates voted him Amerks most valuable player. Can quarterback the power play, and his shot is a power-play weapon. Has played 32 NHL games, including four last season.\nTim Schaller, #11\nTim Schaller. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nCenter\nHeight/weight: 6-2/213.\nAge: 24.\nEstablished himself as a strong two-way player last season, his second in pro hockey. A power forward who fits third-line role perfectly. Produced 15 goals, 28 assists and 43 points while piling up 116 penalty minutes in 65 games. Also played 18 games with the Sabres (1 goal, 1 assist). The Merrimack, New Hampshire, native played four years at Providence College.\nNick Baptiste, #13\nNick Baptiste. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nRight wing\nHeight/weight: 6-1/204.\nAge: 20.\nHis game is about skating, being aggressive on the forecheck and winning puck battles. The rookie was drafted in the third round (69th overall) in 2013 by the Sabres and has strong NHL potential. Coming off a 32-goal, 32-assist, 64-point season split between Sudbury and Erie. It was his fourth and final year in the OHL.\nJustin Kea, #14\nJustin Kea. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nCenter\nHeight/weight: 6-4/220.\nAge: 21.\nBig, strong centerman plays a heavy game. Still fairly raw but made solid strides as a rookie last year, splitting time between Elmira and Rochester. Scored 2 goals in 26 AHL games. He’ll be used in a fourth-line role and has been quite good in the faceoff circle. Not afraid to drop the gloves. A third-round pick in 2012, he played four OHL seasons with Saginaw.\nEvan Rodrigues, #15\nEvan Rodrigues. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nLeft wing\nHeight/weight: 5-11/176.\nAge: 22.\nImpressed Sabres coach Dan Bylsma during camp with his tenacity. High-level skills. He produced 21 goals, 40 assists and 61 points last season alongside Jack Eichel at Boston University. A native of Etobicoke, Ontario (Randy Cunneyworth’s hometown), chose the U.S. college path to ensure an education as well (business). Free-agent signee in April.\nCal O’Reilly, #16\nCal O'Reilly. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nCenter\nHeight/weight: 6-0/188.\nAge: 29.\nThe 10th-year pro is a very gifted centerman, known for creating offense with his hands and his smarts. Produced 10 goals, 51 assists and 61 points for Utica last season, then had 2-17-19 in 23 playoff games. His 51 assists were second-most in the AHL. Was the Comets captain. Played 113 NHL games for Predators, Coyotes and Penguins.\nJack Nevins, #18\nJack Nevins. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nLeft wing\nHeight/weight: 6-1/207.\nAge: 22.\nArrived late on the prospect scene but Sabres general manager Tim Murray has been intrigued. Tried to sign him out of the Quebec league in 2013-14 but Montreal won out. Not big by today’s standards but he is tough. Had 98 penalty minutes in 45 games last year. Must be tenacious and play the body. Scoring has been a mystery so far (no points in 48 career AHL games).\nJerry D’Amigo, #19\nJerry D'Amigo. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nLeft wing\nHeight/weight: 5-11/205.\nAge: 24.\nBrings big-time wheels to the game, with scoring chances and opposing turnovers a byproduct of that speed. Produced 6-13-19 in 31 games for the Amerks after a December trade from Springfield/Columbus. Grew up in Johnson City. Product of USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program. Has played 31 NHL games for Toronto and Buffalo.\nJason Akeson, #20\nJason Akeson.

Produced 23 goals, 30 assists and 53 points in 57 games for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms last season. The fifth-year pro signed with the Sabres organization in July. Is coming off three consecutive 20-goal seasons. Achieved unique trifecta in 2012-13, playing in ECHL, AHL and NHL (Flyers).\nPhil Varone, #22\nPhil Varone. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nCenter\nHeight/weight: 5-10/185.\nAge: 24.\nHas developed into a dynamic scorer during his four seasons with the Amerks. Is an even bigger threat on the power play because of pinpoint passing. Scored 15 goals, 29 assists and 44 points in 55 games last season for the Amerks and 3-2-5 in 28 games with the Sabres. Driven competitor. Earned an invitation to the 2015 AHL All-Star Classic.\nAllan McPherson, #24\nAllan McPherson. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nCenter\nHeight/weight: 5-10/181.\nAge: 24.\nSigned to an AHL contract last season to provide depth, he ended up playing in 44 games with the Amerks as a rookie. Kinburn, Ontario, native is very familiar with New York state after playing four seasons at Clarkson. Scored 3-5-8 for the Amerks. Primarily used in a checking role. He will start the season in Elmira.\nSpiro Goulakos, #27\nSpiro Goulakos.

(Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nLeft wing\nHeight/weight: 6-1/194.\nAge: 20.\nHonest, hard-working winger who experienced the usual rookie growing pains last season. Produced 7 goals, 14 assists and 21 points in 63 games. Season ended in late March due to injury. Was still in junior when obtained by the Sabres from the St. Louis Blues in the Ryan Miller trade in March 2014. Second-round pick of the Blues in 2013.\nLinus Ullmark, #30\nLinus Ullmark. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nGoalie\nHeight/weight: 6-4/212.\nAge: 22.\nStarts the season on the injured list after undergoing surgery on both hips during the off-season. Was named goalie of the year in the Swedish League for 2013-14, when he had a .931 save percentage and 2.08 goals-against average. A big shift last season (.905 save percentage, 3.12 GAA). Sixth-round pick in 2012.\nNathan Lieuwen, #31\nNathan Lieuwen. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nGoalie\nHeight/weight: 6-5/186.\nAge: 24.\nWas among the AHL’s best goaltenders in 2013-14 and then suffered with post-concussion issues for much of last season.

Has played all nine seasons in the Sabres organization, including 348 NHL games. Significant injuries have curtailed his career the past two seasons. Signed an AHL contract on Sept. 12. Expected to be out until November due to injury.\nMatt Ellis, #37\nMatt Ellis. (Photo: Bill Wippert/NHLI via Getty Images)\nCenter/left wing\nHeight/weight: 6-0/212.\nAge: 34.\nThe father of three will be the big brother in the dressing room and on the ice.

Seventh-round pick (193rd overall) in 2012 has gone from project to prospect. Size can be imposing when he plays with physicality.
