We have also sought an independent probe in the incident and urged that a case of attempted murder be lodged against the sponsor so that he is punished, if found guilty as per law,” the Spokesperson in the External Affairs Ministry said. \nMunirathinam is currently being looked after in a Saudi hospital, he said. ”India also proposes to take up this issue in the JWG on Labour Matters with Saudi Arabia which will be held in New Delhi on October 12-13 and is the established institutional mechanism for such matters,” the Spokesperson said, adding, “We will continue to seek justice for the victim.” \nAsked about an update on the condition of three Indians including two teachers, abducted near war-torn Libya and held hostage by the Islamic militant group ISIS, the Spokesperson said they have received a video evidence of their being “alive” as recent as September 27 and they were making all efforts to secure their release. He also said that there was no ransom demand for their release.
