Cathriona White and Jim Carrey, 53, dated briefly after meeting in 2012, but rekindled their relationship in May. Picture: Splash News Source: Supplied \nAccording to Ortega, White was introduced to Scientology by members of singer and Scientologist Beck’s circle of friends. \nOrtega claimed in his blog that they encouraged White to move to the US from Ireland to take Scientology foundation courses. She moved in 2009. \nWhite and Carrey dated briefly from 2012 before rekindling their romance in May this year. They split again on September 24, days before White reportedly took her own life. \nOrtega claimed that White’s friends were worried about the Irish beauty dating Carrey again, but Scientologists assured them she was “emotionally prepared” because “she had just finished the Purif and was doing her objectives.” \nWhite shared an Instagram photo of herself in a sauna less than a year ago and referred to “Purif”. “Purification” ... Cathriona White shared a photo of her undertaking the “Purif””. Picture: Instagram/littleirishcat Source: Supplied \nOrtega described “Purif”, an abbreviation of “Purification Rundown” as “a process invented by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard that he claimed could ‘detoxify’ the body through an intense regimen of daily sauna sessions and massive doses of the vitamin niacin.” \nHe continued: “The ‘objectives’ are exercises that in recent years have been made part of a newer version of a course called the ‘Survival Rundown’ which Scientology leader David Miscavige has made a prime requisite of Scientologists, both the new and the experienced. The ‘SRD’ is being pushed to all Scientologists, even those who may have long ago previously done their ‘objectives’ on their way up the Bridge to Total Freedom.” \nNews Corp Australia has contacted The Church of Scientology for comment. Rekindled romance ... Jim Carrey with Cathriona White taking a walk in Manhattan in May.

There will be no further statements on behalf of the family.” \nWhite’s mother, sister and stepmother said they would travel to Los Angeles from Ireland to make arrangements for her body to return home. \n“It’s a terrible journey for her mother to have to make,” a family friend told People magazine. “Everybody is hoping that her body can be returned home quickly now.” \nIf you or someone you know needs help, please contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, or visit Beyond Blue’s website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:17:30.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
