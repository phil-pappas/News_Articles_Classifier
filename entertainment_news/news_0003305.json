Photo: Michael Clayton-Jones \nHead of newsgathering, Craig McMurtrie, has been appointed deputy director.\nAdvertisement In a statement, ABC Managing Director Mark Scott said he was confident the broadcaster would remain in reliable hands following the appointments of McMurtrie and Morris.\n\"Gaven comes to this role with a strong record in managing the complexity of large news rooms and, in particular, building news brands such as ABC News 24,\" Mr Scott said. \"He is well positioned to lead ABC News into its next chapter.\"\nMr Morris started his career as a copy boy in the Parliament House bureau of The Sydney Morning Herald before going on to senior roles at Al Jazeera and CNN.\nMs Torney's resignation after more than 20 years with the organisation came as a shock to many of her colleagues including Insiders host Barrie Cassidy, who said her departure would spell \"tougher times ahead\" for the ABC.\nThe respected journalist vacated the role to become the chief executive of the State Library of Victoria.\nMs Torney gave her blessing to her predecessor on Twitter following Thursday's announcement, describing it as a new era for ABC News.\nCassidy also congratulated Mr Morris, describing him as \"the most progressive individual at the ABC\".\nFollowing criticism of the broadcaster's coverage of asylum seekers and border protection forces last year, Mr Morris  found himself in the headlines after sending an email to ABC staff warning them not to \"embellish\" asylum seeker claims of mistreatment.\nThe edict sent to top ABC brass followed calls from former prime minister Tony Abbott that the national broadcaster give the Australian Navy \"benefit of the doubt\".\nNew era for @abcnews -congratulations @gavmorris & @craigmcmurtrie .
