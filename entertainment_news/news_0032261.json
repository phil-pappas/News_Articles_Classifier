And she is glad that she doesn't fit labels.\n\"I'm more like the archaeopteryx,\" she says, baring her etched arm. \"It's a creature between two worlds and that's what I am,\" chirps the pocket-sized girl who had rapped against a multinational giant for causing mercury pollution with their thermometer plant in Kodaikanal, two months ago.\nWith tongue firmly in cheek and a video spoofing a Nicki Minaj song `Kodaikanal Won't' kicked up a storm on social media, pooled in petitions and compelled the company's CEO to break his silence on the issue.\nThe copywriter is ecstatic that her carefully designed \"piggyback\" on popular culture to grab attention was not just a shot in the dark. \"(The multinational company) has got into talks with workers about compensation. The municipality is ensuring reparations. Politicians like Seeman and Kanimozhi have organized massive gatherings,\" she beams. With no word on the MNC's toxic cleanup yet the peeve factor remains. \"Selfies and tweets (to the CEO) till then,\" she declares, expressing dissent at him being given a major green award by the UN. \"That came as a blow. We wrote to the UN and hope he lives up to the responsibility of being conferred the honour.\"\nOn Friday the Tamil rapper who catalyzed a 14-year-old movement performed her first gig in Mumbai. It was also her farewell to the city she made her home for five years. Before she heads back to her hometown Chennai to make music and help build Cuckoo, a free forest school at the foothills of the Javadhu range in Tamil Nadu, Sofia took centrestage at The Hive to sing her story in reverse.Be it dumping her burqa, shaving her head, spoofing a song already steeped in controversy and quitting her pay cheques to make music, there is a method to her madness. And it's taking her from strength to strength.\nIronically, Sofia started the year ready to give up music until `Kodaikanal Won't' came as a shake-up call for her as much as the millions who watched it. Banking on her newfound voice, she wants to combine writing, music and activism, focusing on \"women and their dualities\".\nInterestingly , she isn't a new phenomenon online. Six years ago, she was clocking in YouTube views as a diminutive burqa-clad rapper rhyming on religion, the Mumbai attack and Dow chemicals. \"It wasn't a gimmick. I was a staunch Muslim and ga ve up religion at 22. Both by choice.\"\nThe 28-year-old currently has tuned into everything from AR Rahman to rockfests while she readies to camp in the woods and bathe with shikakai. \"I've found alternatives for (the MNC's) products,\" she says.\"Isn't my life a fairytale?\" For every other Sofia who hopes to buck the system, this powerpuff is clearly turning the tide.
