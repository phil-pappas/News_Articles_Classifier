Photo: Melissa Phillip, Staff Image 8 of 8 Will Sugar Land beauty queen be America's final 'Top Model'? 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Sugar Land beauty queen Hadassah Richardson is still in the running to become America's final \"Top Model.\"\nThe reality competition is down to just five hopefuls, who are striking poses and stomping runways in Las Vegas. Creator Tyra Banks confirmed this month that the current season is the show's last. \"America's Next Top Model\" debuted on UPN in 2003 and switched to the CW in 2006. It's consistently been one of the network's highest-rating series and still has a devoted social media following.\nRichardson, 23, has been near elimination a few times and gotten into dust-ups with several models on the show. She incited one of the season's most memorable moments with her set of house rules, which included to not put your fingers in her food (reasonable) and \"Don't stare at me from a distance\" (a little crazy).\nThe show airs at 8 p.m. Friday on the CW.\nBut Richardson has softened as the show has progressed. The judges have advised her to be less pageant-like and more sincere, and she's listened. And there's no denying she has the look for magazine covers and runways.\nRichardson grew up in Missouri City and was Miss Sugar Land 2013. She ran a babysitting service for several years with a staff of more than 20 employees. But given her \"Top Model\" run, it's unlikely she'll go back to that full time.\nPast locals include Brandy Rusher, Cassandra Whitehead, Chris Schellenger and Denzel Wells , who can be seen on the Tyler Perry soap opera \"The Haves and the Have Nots.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/25/64/8477953/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838995/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838990/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838992/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/25/64/8477953/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838991/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/25/64/8477966/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838990/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838991/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838995/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838992/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838994/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/25/64/8477966/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/75/8838994/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:31:37.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
