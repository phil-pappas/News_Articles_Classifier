My husband is really good with technology and eventually I got really sick of asking him how to do everything,” she confesses. \n“So I started to pay attention and he explained to me how it works. Now I’m definitely more adept than I was.” \nThe husband in question is actor/jewellery designer Adam Shulman and, three years into their marriage, she clearly remains utterly enamoured of him. \n“He’s very smart and wise and has a lot of parity about things. He is number one on my list of people I go to for advice. I’m so lucky. Considering he’s only a couple of years older than me, he’s very grounded and I am very comfortable to go to him for anything.” \nHathaway says she is also fortunate to have a large and diverse group of friends. \n“I have older friends who I go to for life experience and I’m lucky to have a wide range of friends, some of whom I’ve known since I was five years old. We all take care of each other in a lot of different ways.” Actor Anne Hathaway and husband Adam Shulman. Picture: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images.

Unsurprisingly, she gushes about her fellow Oscar-winning co-star. \n“In the early moments of filming I remember standing next to him trying to think of something to say, and then coming up with a really lame joke. About three weeks in I finally relaxed and I felt like, ‘Oh my gosh. I am essentially dancing with Fred Astaire here, it feels that big’.” Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro in a scene from the film The Intern.

We all wanted to go to the movies but couldn’t find anything we could all see and I was thinking, ‘Why don’t they make a grown-up family film?’ Then this script came to me and it really resonated with me. \n“My mother is now enjoying a second career as a theatrical producer and my father-in-law used to work in fashion so I felt like I had won the lottery when it all came together in this script.” \nClearly revelling in marital bliss, Hathaway appears to have mastered juggling her day job as an actor and a more conventional role as a wife. \n“Yes, I’m a pretty good multi-tasker but I think women are naturally good. I don’t know about dudes because I am not one. Maybe it’s the hair and makeup tax we have — the hours a woman spends in a day getting herself ready that men don’t have to deal with. \n“I think you learn how to do things while thinking about things and planning things just by the nature of being a woman.” Anne Hathaway knows how to work it on the red carpet.

That can be fun. But sometimes there is nothing like going down the street, going to a brick and mortar where you see something you fall in love with and think, ‘I’m walking away and if it’s still on my mind in 24 hours I’m coming back for it.’ And then you’re back in 12 minutes.” \nHathaway has been in the public eye since she was 19 when she starred in The Princess Diaries , before venturing into riskier roles in movies such as Brokeback Mountain (2005), The Devil Wears Prada (2006), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). She earned her Oscar for Les Miserables in 2013. Anne Hathaway has come a long way from playing a dorky girl in Princess Diaries.

Most notably, she endured a troubled romance with real estate developer Raffaello Follieri until it emerged he had defrauded his contacts of millions of dollars in a scheme which saw him, falsely, claiming to be representing the Vatican. He was jailed in 2008 for four years. She also experienced a backlash in the media after she won her Oscar which prompted various ‘hate sites.’ \nNow 32, Hathaway is philosophical about life’s ups and downs. \n“If you can live long enough, then life will teach you what you need to know. It’s like success, which is a privilege and even then, life is not a fairy tale through and through. You have to learn how to manage it and how to have grace and humility.” Anne Hathaway looking gorgeous at the premiere of \"The Intern\" at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York.
