The $15 million \"Rock the Kasbah\" opened in 13th place and earned only $1.5 million, and the expensive Vin Diesel vehicle \"The Last Witch Hunter\" opened in fourth place with $10.8 million. It cost a reported $70-$80 million to make. \n\"Steve Jobs\" also failed to impress in its first weekend in wide release earning only $7.1 million, despite a strong two weekends in limited release, stellar reviews and awards buzz. \nPoor performances by the new films allowed \"The Martian\" to reclaim the top spot at the box office in its fourth weekend in theatres with $15.7 million. Holdovers \"Goosebumps\" and \"Bridge of Spies\" took the second and third place spots. \nThe top 20 movies at U.S. and Canadian theatres Friday through Sunday, followed by distribution studio, gross, number of theatre locations, average receipts per location, total gross and number of weeks in release, as compiled Monday by Rentrak: \n1. \"The Martian,\" 20th Century Fox, $15,732,907, 3,504 locations, $4,490 average, $166,188,055, 4 weeks. \n2. \"Goosebumps,\" Sony, $15,525,901, 3,501 locations, $4,435 average, $43,738,043, 2 weeks. \n3. \"Bridge Of Spies,\" Disney, $11,374,203, 2,811 locations, $4,046 average, $32,590,400, 2 weeks. \n4. \"The Last Witch Hunter,\" Lionsgate, $10,812,861, 3,082 locations, $3,508 average, $10,812,861, 1 week. \n5. \"Hotel Transylvania 2,\" Sony, $8,883,348, 3,154 locations, $2,817 average, $148,175,889, 5 weeks. \n6. \"Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,\" Paramount, $8,070,493, 1,656 locations, $4,873 average, $8,070,493, 1 week. \n7. \"Steve Jobs,\" Universal, $7,105,735, 2,493 locations, $2,850 average, $9,818,543, 3 weeks. \n8. \"Crimson Peak,\" Universal, $5,666,525, 2,991 locations, $1,895 average, $22,557,300, 2 weeks. \n9. \"The Intern,\" Warner Bros., $3,787,039, 2,061 locations, $1,837 average, $64,634,921, 5 weeks. \n10. \"Sicario,\" Lionsgate, $2,844,854, 1,448 locations, $1,965 average, $39,280,401, 6 weeks. \n11. \"Pan,\" Warner Bros., $2,628,197, 1,944 locations, $1,352 average, $29,909,891, 3 weeks. \n12. \"Woodlawn,\" Pure Flix, $2,575,337, 1,475 locations, $1,746 average, $7,949,985, 2 weeks. \n13. \"Rock The Kasbah,\" Open Road, $1,470,592, 2,012 locations, $731 average, $1,470,592, 1 week. \n14. \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,\" 20th Century Fox, $1,417,404, 1,008 locations, $1,406 average, $77,697,363, 6 weeks. \n15. \"Jem And The Holograms,\" Universal, $1,375,320, 2,413 locations, $570 average, $1,375,320, 1 week. \n16. \"Black Mass,\" Warner Bros., $579,437, 458 locations, $1,265 average, $61,318,273, 6 weeks. \n17. \"Everest,\" Universal, $554,190, 400 locations, $1,385 average, $41,780,170, 6 weeks. \n18. \"The Visit,\" Universal, $535,725, 508 locations, $1,055 average, $63,874,445, 7 weeks. \n19. \"War Room,\" Sony, $495,934, 449 locations, $1,105 average, $66,287,144, 9 weeks. \n20. \"Shaandaar,\" Fox International Productions, $384,685, 136 locations, $2,829 average, $433,541, 1 week. \n--- \nUniversal and Focus are owned by NBC Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.; Sony, Columbia, Sony Screen Gems and Sony Pictures Classics are units of Sony Corp.; Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc.; Disney, Pixar and Marvel are owned by The Walt Disney Co.; Miramax is owned by Filmyard Holdings LLC; 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight are owned by 21st Century Fox; Warner Bros. and New Line are units of Time Warner Inc.; MGM is owned by a group of former creditors including Highland Capital, Anchorage Advisors and Carl Icahn; Lionsgate is owned by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; IFC is owned by AMC Networks Inc.; Rogue is owned by Relativity Media LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:21:54.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
