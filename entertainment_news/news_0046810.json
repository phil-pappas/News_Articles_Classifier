The Marvel Studios president responded to a campaign initiated by fans to cast the MMA fighter in the first female superhero standalone movie. \"I love it. That happens occasionally, and I think that's a testament more to the strength of the characters,\" Feige said in an interview with IGN. \"You look at the ways we've cast our films in the past and it's always about who's the best person to inhabit the character ...For us, it's sitting down with people and starting to meet people and as the script takes shape and as we start to build who the character should be and finding the right person to match it up.\" Rousey has been expressing an interest in playing the superhero since August's Reddit AMA. She received many artworks from artists and fans which depict some possible looks at the 28-year-old as Captain Marvel. \"There were so many cool ones I couldn't pick just one to share,\" she commented on the pics . \"Captain Marvel\" is scheduled for release on November 2, 2018. Other names that have been rumored as Captain Marvel candidate were Emily Blunt and Rebecca Ferguson (II) . \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Captain Marvel News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:21:04.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
