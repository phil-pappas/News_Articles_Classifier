Stine, Slappy, and Invisible Boy, appears in a scene in Columbia Pictures' \"Goosebumps.\" (Hopper Stone, SMPSP / Associated Press) Saba Hamedy Contact Reporter \nSony's \"Goosebumps\" adaptation dominated the box office this weekend, while Netflix's \"Beasts of No Nation\" saw lower turnouts after debuting simultaneously online and in limited release. \n\"Goosebumps,\" which stars Jack Black, launched with a solid $23.5 million in the U.S and Canada. It outpaced three other new releases as well as Fox's \"The Martian,\" which fell to second place in its third weekend. \nThe strong opening comes on the heels of Sony's animated hit \"Hotel Transylvania 2.\" Both films benefitted from a dearth of family-friendly films in the marketplace, with young moviegoers making up a large chunk of audiences. \nThe film, which cost $58 million to make, is based on R.L. Stine's popular anthology series from the 1990s. Audiences -- a majority (59%) of which were under the age of 25 --gave it an A grade on polling firm CinemaScore. It also scored a decent 71% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\"It's a really terrific start,\" said Rory Bruer, Sony's president of distribution. \"The film just resonated...it is really fun for all ages and the whole family. It did a great job in translating a franchise to film. Jack Black was also so key to the success of the movie.\" \nDirector Ridley Scott's \"The Martian,\" which cost $108 million to make, fell 42% and added $21.5 million to its domestic haul. \nThe space film, which has collected about $143.8 million in the U.S. and Canada to date, follows astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who, assumed to be dead, is stranded alone on the hostile planet. Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Donald Glover also star. \nComing in third, Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies,\" released by Disney, met tracking expectations with a $15.38-million debut. \nThe Cold War thriller, which stars Tom Hanks as an attorney named James B. Donovan, was co-financed by DreamWorks and Fox in association with Participant Media. \n\"The movie is what you would expect from Steven Spielberg, who is one of the most consistent high-quality storytellers in the history of the movie business and has delivered once again,\" said Dave Hollis, Disney's head of distribution. \"Combine him with Tom Hanks and you've created something that is sticky and electric.\" \nAs expected, the film attracted mostly adults (92%). About 43% of moviegoers were 50 years of age or older. The film also had slightly more male moviegoers (about 53%). \nHollis said older audiences, who normally don't rush to theaters on opening weekend, were likely more drawn to the subject matter and \"period nature of the film.\" The studio saw a similar turnout with \"Lincoln\" in 2012, which Hollis said was \"a great start but primarily an older audience start.\" \nReviews have been fairly strong, with critics giving it an 92% positive rating score on Rotten Tomatoes and A CinemaScore. Hollis is confident strong reviews and word-of-mouth will help give the film long legs at the box office. \nLegendary’s \"Crimson Peak,\" released by Universal Pictures, finished in fourth with $12.8 million. \nThe R-rated film, from director Guillermo del Toro, is a gothic romance starring Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska and Charlie Hunnam. It cost $55 million to make. \n\"It's the only R-rated film in the top five this weekend, which I think speaks to the fact that there's a lot to offer there,\" said Nick Carpou, Universal's head of domestic distribution. \"But I think there was an audience.\" \nMoviegoers, mostly female (60%) and 25 and older (55%), gave the film a B- grade on CinemaScore. It also has the lowest Rotten Tomato score of the new offerings with a 68% positive rating. \nCarpou said a large draw for moviegoers was del Toro. \n\"I think there are a lot of directors in the business that make very interesting movies but I think there are fewer directors that make interesting movies and can be generally considered auteurs. Guillermo del Toro is definitely one of those,\"Carpou added. \nFaith-based indie film \"Woodlawn\" debuted at No. 9, collecting $4.1 million on 1,500 screens. \nThe film, from brothers Jon and Andrew Erwin (“Moms’ Night Out”), is based on the true story of a Woodlawn High School Football team, in Birmingham, Ala., in 1973. It stars Sean Astin, Nic Bishop, Caleb Castille, Sherri Shepherd and Jon Voight. \nPure Flix, the film's distributor, has aggressively positioned it for wide release because of \"the significant reception and opportunity to reach audiences with its message of unity through faith,\" a spokesman said. The studio's budget and opening weekend expectations were not disclosed. \nMeanwhile, Netflix's \"Beasts of No Nation,\" distributed theatrically by Bleecker Street Media, didn't find its footing in limited release. \nThe Cary Joji Fukunaga film, based on the 2005 novel by Nigerian author Uzodinma Iweala, collected $50,699 in 31 theaters, making its per theater average $1,635. \nIt follows a boy (played by 15-year-old Abraham Attah ) after he joins an army of young soldiers under a commandant (played by Idris Elba). \nStill, the Los Gatos-based company's decision to release the film on the big screen was strategic. The well-reviewed film, which stars Idris Elba, has generated much buzz for Netflix, helping the streaming giant make its launch into feature filmmaking and distribution. \nNetflix, which has 70 million worldwide subscribers, has more movies to come, including Adam Sandler comedy \"The Ridiculous Six\" (due in December), the sequel to \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (set for early next year) and the Brad Pitt satire \"War Machine\" (set for late next year). \nAlso in limited release, A24's \"The Room\" debuted with $120,000 on 4 screens, for a solid $30,000 per theater average. The film, based on the bestselling novel by Emma Donoghue, has been generating Oscar buzz since it premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September. \nIt follows a young woman (played by Brie Larson) who has been imprisoned for years in a single room in a tiny shed with her young son (played by Jacob Tremblay) who was born to her there. \nSony Pictures Classics \"Truth\" also made its limited debut in six theaters to less robust results. It made $76,646 or a per screen average of $12,774. \nThe film, which stars Robert Redford as Dan Rather and Cate Blanchett as producer Mary Mapes, follows the \"60 Minutes\" news team when they aired a controversial report on George W. Bush’s National Guard service. \nYear-to-date, the box office is up almost 6%, according to film research firm Rentrak. The strong fall slate will likely help keep the industry on track to reach or surpass box office records. \nNext weekend, Universal's \"Steve Jobs\" will expand to wide release after performing strongly in limited. In its second weekend, it made $1.5 million in 60 theaters, bringing its cumulative domestic total to $2.26 million. \nAlso opening next weekend, Lionsgate’s “The Last Witch Hunter,” Universal’s “Jem and the Holograms,” Paramount’s “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” and Open Road’s “Rock the Kasbah.\" \nLos Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:25:52.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
