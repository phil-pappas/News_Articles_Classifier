Kim, who was standing with her in their kitchen, gets visibly annoyed. \nIn her confessional interview, Kim shares her wariness about Khloe speaking to Lamar again after their divorce. \"I don't know why Khloe and Lamar are talking, but he hurt her so badly,\" the reality TV star explains. \"As a big sister I'm just really protective, and for her just to be flirting with him on the phone makes me sick to my stomach.\" \nKhloe and Odom split in December 2013 after four years of marriage. Khloe filed for the divorce amid rumors of Odom's alleged drug use and infidelity, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" \nAfter Khloe hangs up the phone, Kim confronts her sister, according to the preview clip. \"I just can't take it,\" Kim tells Khloe. \"The fact that when he decides to come around and be friendly, you're like, flirting with him.\" \n\"I'm flirting with him how?\" Khloe retorts. \"By answering the phone and saying hello?\" \nKim replies that she thinks Khloe is \"way more attentive\" to Odom than to her most recent ex-boyfriend, rapper French Montana. \n\"Why would French and Lamar even be in the same category?,\" Khloe responds. \nFind out how Kim responds when Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs this Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern on E! \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
