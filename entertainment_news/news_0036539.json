Headlining the second night of the festival that year following Florence and the Machine and Thirty Seconds to Mars, Muse thrilled fans, performing their hits including “ Starlight “,”Time Is Running Out”, “Stockholm Syndrome”, and their cover of “ Feeling Good .” \nDuring their over twenty-year career, the trio has released seven studio albums and sold over seventeen million of those albums around the world. In addition to multiple MTV, NME, and Q Awards and nominations, Muse won the Grammy Award for “Best Rock Album” for their third release, The Resistance , in 2011. \nPart alternative rock, part glam, part progressive rock, and part heavy metal with a sprinkling of opera, and classical music, Muse’s sounds have morphed, blended and evolved during the past two decades leading to current sci-fi concept album, Drones , which was released earlier this year. While not their highest rate album nor the most well-received, Thursday’s show promises to be an experience not to be missed by Muse and rock fans in Rio de Janeiro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:33:29.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
