By Matt Porter \nSony is releasing a range of custom faceplates for PlayStation 4 consoles in Europe. \nAll you have to do to change the faceplate is remove the HDD bay cover, then slide your chosen cover over the PS4's hard disc drive. \nThere are six colors to choose from: Neon Orange, Aqua Blue, Red and Glacier White will be available from November 18, and Gold and Silver will be coming to select regions at a later date. Gold and Silver will not be available in the UK, Ireland or Australia, while Neon Orange won't be available in Scandinavia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:08:16.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
