Closing track Wish, for example, is a Someone Like You regret-fest powered by memories of associated London places (Camberwell Road, Picadilly underground, Whitchapel). It's neatly done and well-crafted, quality tune-smithery from a production team including regular collaborator Jonas Quant and new arrival Stuart Price who recorded as Les Rhythmes Digitales before turning producer for the likes of Madonna, Pet Shop Boys and The Killers.\nAt the other end of the scale is party banger Nothing Will Be Bigger Than Us, with its euphoric “oh-oh-oh” vocal fills, its builds, drops and hands-in-the-air crescendos. Why strays into the rather more interesting territory that Jungle have colonised but it's left to Rolling Stone to show what Hurts can do when they set their minds (and their pens) to the task. “In Belarus she was a vespertine/She danced the go-go for the bourgeoisie,” Hutchcraft sings.\nShare article There's too little of that here. Still, it's hard to argue with Hurts's numbers: a million albums and three million singles sold. If it ain't broke, why bother fixing it?\nBarry Didcock", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-14T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:43:58.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
