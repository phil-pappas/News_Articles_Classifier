Just look at the Kardashians. Despite building a pop culture empire that puts other reality TV stars to shame, they all have had their fair share of crises over the years. Unfortunately, former son-in-law Lamar Odom's drug overdose is just one in a series of troubles the family has faced over the decades. Here's the rundown: \n1991: Kris and Robert Kardashian divorce. Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch Kris Jenner divorced first husband Robert Kardashian in 1991 after 13 years of marriage. She revealed in her memoir \"Kris Jenner...And All Things Kardashian\" that they split because she was having an affair with a producer named \"Ryan.\" Although she eventually patched things up with Robert enough to be friends later on, she said the divorce was \"ugly\" and \"scary.\" They had four kids (Kourtney, Kim, Kloe and Robert Jr.) at the time. ( WENN.COM ) \n1994: Kris' friend Nicole Brown Simpson is murdered. Kris was good friends with Nicole Brown Simpson and Robert was friends with O.J. Simpson long before the \"Trial of the Century.\" But on June 12, 1994, Nicole was killed and, shortly after, O.J. was charged with her murder. The friendship Kris and Robert had etched out after the divorce was put to the test with Kris mourning the loss of her friend while her ex-husband joined the defence team of the man accused of killing her. By the time O.J. received his \"not guilty\" verdict, Kris was remarried to Bruce Jenner and had given birth to daughter Kendall. Kris gave her the middle name \"Nicole\" in honour of her slain friend.

He married third wife Ellen Pierson six weeks before he died and the Kardashian children have claimed she tried to stop them from visiting their dad on his deathbed. Ten years later, the Kardashians sued Pierson for their dad's diary and family photo albums believed to be in her possession. (Wikipedia) \n2013: Kim and Kris Humphries quickie marriage Kim's marriage to NBA player Kris Humphries was laughably dubbed \"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\" when it aired on E!. It featured a tacky black and white theme, three different wedding dresses and a reception at a $20 million Montecito estate. Mother-of-the bride Kris Jenner prepared for the big day the only way she knew how: a last-minute facelift rumoured to have cost $50,000. The whole shindig reportedly cost $10 million - and in just 72 days the marriage was over, subjecting Kim to ridicule the world over. ( WENN.COM ) \n2012- Present: Rob Kardashian Jr.'s weight problems On the show, Rob's weight gain has been attributed to bad eating habits and low self-esteem, but rumours of depression and drug use won't go away. In one episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, he was informed his lifestyle was causing him liver damage and when his sister Kim married Kanye West in 2014, Rob decided to skip the big event because he didn't feel comfortable being around so many people at his size. He e-mailed Kim the day before the wedding to inform her he wouldn't be there. ( WENN.COM ) \n2012: Is Khloe a Kardashian? Robert Kardashian's third wife Ellen Pierson questions Khloe's paternity and accuses Kris of being an abusive mother. ( WENN.COM ) \n2013: Khloe Kardashian divorces Lamar over drug problems Khloe and Lamar may have fallen in love during a whirlwind romance (they got married a month after meeting) but the breakup has dragged on for almost two years. After four years of marriage and Lamar's increasingly erratic behaviour, Khloe filed for divorce in 2013. ( WENN.COM ) \n2014: Kris and Bruce divorce. The one seemingly stable relationship in the family ended in 2014 when Kris and her second husband Bruce Jenner split after 22 years of marriage. ( WENN.COM ) \n2015: Introducing Caitlyn and more family drama. After spending his whole life living a lie, Bruce transitioned into Caitlyn and made her debut to the world on the cover of Vanity Fair's July 2015 issue. In the feature, Caitlyn took some shots at ex-wife Kris, saying she was \"mistreated\" in the marriage and called Kris \"controlling\" and \"not very nice.\" The article divides the family. (Reuters/Vanity Fair files) \n2015: Kourtney splits from father of three children Oldest Kardashian Kourtney finally threw boyfriend Scott Disick to the curb after his years of drunken partying and irresponsibility. Disick is off to rehab now after Kourtney reportedly threatened to take visitation of the kids away from him. ( WENN.COM ) \nLamar Odom's pal Jamie Sangouthai overdoses and dies.
