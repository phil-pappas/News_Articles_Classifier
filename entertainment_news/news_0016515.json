But that only extends so far. \nThere is a lot of story to tell here: Abel's highly publicized trial; the threats Donovan encounters for defending him - threats that literally hit home, when guns are fired into the Donovans' living room. There's even a plea before the Supreme Court. And then the whole Francis Gary Powers business: a United States pilot who was captured and condemned as a spy. His U2 reconnaissance plane, with its 4,500mm camera lenses, was clipped by Soviet missiles high in the sky. \nDonovan had argued against the death penalty for Abel, advising that it would be prudent to keep the Russian alive, in case the need ever arose for a swap. \nAnd here was Powers (Austin Stowell), a prisoner of the Soviets. Donovan is enlisted by none other than CIA director Allen Dulles (Peter McRobbie) to go to Berlin and negotiate the exchange. It's strictly unofficial, and Donovan finds himself moving in shadowy quarters, with shifty company - unsure who, if anyone, has his back. \nThings grow more complicated when an American graduate student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), is nabbed by the East Germans and charged with espionage. (The real-life Pryor is an economics scholar at Swarthmore; the details of his arrest back in 1961 have been dressed up and dramatized.) \nThe gripping finale of Bridge of Spies occurs on the Galenical, the titular structure that crosses the Have River and linked the East with the West. Donovan and Abel get to spend a few taut minutes on its span, and for all the mounting suspense (what about this other American over at Checkpoint Charlie?), it's great to see the actors together again, exchanging words in the wintry night. \n215-854-5629@Steven_Rea Bridge of Spies ***1/2 (Out of four stars) \nDirected by Steven Spielberg.
