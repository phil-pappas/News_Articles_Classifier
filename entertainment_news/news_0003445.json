Both sides have been negotiating since before the previous contract expired on June 30. \nRepresentatives of the school board and the teachers union are expected to meet again Thursday for further negotiations. In the event of a strike, classes would be canceled on Tuesday. But students attending private or special-education schools outside the Ellwood City Area School District and at the Lawrence County Career and Technical Center would still have classes. \nStudents transported by Ellwood City Transit to nonpublic schools and the career center would still use the district's contracted bus service. \nDistrict officials are in the process of determining how the strike could impact athletic schedules. With the district's regular website offline for updating, schedule changes will be posted at the district's temporary website at https://sites.google.com/a/ellwood.k12.pa.us/ellwood-city-area-school-district/ .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:09:16.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
