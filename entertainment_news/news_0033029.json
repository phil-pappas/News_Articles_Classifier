That allowed us to bond.” \nDurant, using American Sign Language that was translated by his fiancee, Bridget Mitchell, said he didn’t know what to expect when he visited the Orpheum Theater. “Stomp” starts simply enough, with a lone performer sweeping the stage, but builds into a rambunctious frenzy of rhythm. \nOver the course of 90 minutes, “Stomp” performers press everyday objects — lighters, garbage cans, basketballs, poles, buckets, massive oil drums — into percussive service as they dance. \n“When they started with the broom, I didn’t realize until I started picking up the movement that they were doing visual patterns. I did feel a little bit of the vibrations but not quite,” said Durant, who attended with another deaf “Spring Awakening” performer, Russell Harvard, who has appeared on the TV show “Fargo.” \n“When they picked up the percussion and things got, I imagine, louder, I could feel the vibrations and then it was even more incredible. I’ve never laughed so much in a theatrical experience as an audience member,” Durant added. \nDurant is making his Broadway debut and hopes he can find more roles, especially in a town that welcomes fresh, new talent with theater tickets to other shows. \n“I love the work that I do and any opportunity that I get, I will be happy to continue this work. I love sharing this art and very thankful to be in this position,” he said. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:35:33.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
