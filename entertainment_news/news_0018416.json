The series brings back protagonist Olivia \"Liv\" Moore, a former medical resident turned zombie, as she struggles to live her life as a zombie working in the city morgue while helping out the Seattle police solve murder cases. She is pretending to be a psychic consultant but is in fact able to see flashbacks of the crime once she eats the brain of the murder victim. \nAs the season has already premiered, showrunner Rob Thomas recently shared what fans can expect from the show this season. This season will be all about Liv's relationships with the people around her, from her ex-fiance, her family and even her enemies. According to a report in TVLine , Liv's ex-fiance, Major, will be dealing with a \"moral crisis\" this season, as he has been blackmailed by villain Max Rager to get rid of all zombies in Seattle. If Major does not agree to do it, Rager will go after Liv. Major has also apparently acquired a new ability which is being able to sense when a person is a zombie. Thomas however said that Major will eventually find a way to get out of this predicament somewhere along the season. \nThis season will also have Liv dealing with an unknown enemy in her midst in the person of Gilda who is posing as Liv's new roommate. Gilda has been tasked by Rager to spy on Liv. According to Thomas, Liv will be oblivious of this at first but as the season progresses, she will eventually find out about Gilda's treachery. \nNew villains will be appearing this season, according to the report. In addition to Blaine, the drug-dealer turned zombie, Rager will be making his presence felt. Blaine will also be going against the crime lord of Seattle called Mr. Boss, who will be making some appearances this season as well. \nLastly, one of the things that fans should watch out for this season is whether a zombie cure will soon be discovered or not. A white zombie rat called New Hope will be in the center of this search for such a cure. Thomas however does not reveal which way this search will go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:16:49.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
