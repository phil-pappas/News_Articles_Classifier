To try and change laws that are hindering the music biz. To make sure that songwriters and artists can practice their art without threat of extinction. To make sure those who practice their craft get paid fairly when others use their work. \n\"I received a real lesson on this a couple (of) years ago when I started to look into laws surrounding copyright. I found out that there was an effort underway in Washington to strip certain important approval rights of artists and songwriters for derivative use of their work... It's not about Wall Street derivatives; it's about artists and songwriters losing control of their work and not getting paid fairly when it is used. More of the same, I thought. It taught me that creators have to be vigilant and fight for their rights.\" \nTyler also recalls meeting politicians in Washington, D.C. and telling them how \"devastating\" it is to use artists' work without permission, but nothing has changed. \n\"We know you love our music,\" he concludes. \"Now is the time to show us some love by supporting the effort to reform outdated copyright laws, do away with government standard for artist compensation, and make sure creators are paid fairly when other business use (sic) our work.\" \nIn February, Tyler become a founding member of the GRAMMY Creators' Alliance which advocated for artists' rights, alongside Adam Levine, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson.
