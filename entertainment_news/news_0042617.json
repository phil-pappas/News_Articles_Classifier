Coaches Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Pharrell Williams paired up artists to go head-to-head. No artists from Gwen Stefani's team were featured in the one-hour episode. \nThe show ended with Blake stealing Ivonne Acero from Pharrell. \nWe again saw appearances by mentors John Fogerty (Team Adam), Brad Paisley (Team Blake) and Missy Elliott (Team Pharrell). \nTeam Adam got things started with Manny Cabo and Keith Semple, the latter of whom is originally from Northern Ireland but now lives in Chicago. They were assigned The Who classic \"Baba O'Riley.\" Adam helped out by playing drums during the rehearsals. \nBlake, referring to the lyrics of the song, jokingly asked, \"How did you know I'm wasted?\" He then added that it was one of the best battles The Voice has ever seen. Adam named Keith the winner, citing his beautiful register. Manny was eliminated. \nBlake pit Chris Crump against Krista Hughes. The two tackled “When I Get Where I’m Going\" by their mentor, Brad Paisley, and Dolly Parton. \nBlake said Chris is a great storyteller. He told Krista that she did a good job of adding her touch to the song. He chose Chris as the winner because he was more consistent. \nThe final battle featured a pair of Team Pharrell teens: Ivonne Acero and Siahna Im. They sang a tune that is way before their time: The Supremes' \"You Keep Me Hangin' On.\" \nGwen confessed she didn't know who she'd pick as the winner, if she were in Pharrell's position. Adam thought both artists have some things to work on vocally. Pharrell said there's so much potential with both of them. Siahna remains on Team Pharrell, but Gwen and Blake both tried to steal Ivonne. Ivonne went with Blake. \nThe battle rounds continue next Monday night on NBC. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
