R. Martin is going to be turned into TV series. Cinemax is adapting Martin's werewolf novella \"The Skin Trade\" and has handed out a pilot script order. Martin confirmed the news on his blog Saturday, October 10. \"I have always thought there was a TV series (or maybe a feature film) in Willie Flambeaux and Randi Wade,\" he wrote, referencing to characters in his book. \"Those of you who know the story of DOORWAYS, my ill-fated ABC pilot from the early 90s, may even recall that it was SKIN TRADE that I was actually trying to sell back in 1991, when I flew out to LA for a round of pitch meetings. So we're a few decades late.\" \"The Skin Trade\" centers on Willie Flambeaux, a collections agent who happens to be a werewolf, and his friend, Randi Wade, a private investigator, who discover a dark secret behind a series of grisly murders in their decaying industrial city. Kalinda Vazquez (\" Prison Break \", \" Once Upon a Time \") will write the pilot and executive produce the show. Martin will also serve as executive producer, noting that he would have written the pilot himself if he had not been working on the next \"Game of Thrones\" book, \"The Winds of Winter\". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:43.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
