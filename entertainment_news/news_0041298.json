The even better news is that if you don't like Amy Schumer (or Live at the Apollo ), she doesn't give a fuck. After all, she entered to Nicki Minaj's \"Beez in the Trap\"; specifically, to the line \"A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing.\"\n Schumer spent the night in mostly familiar territory, which is to say she talked about her vagina (and yours, and mine, and Michelle Obama's) a lot. She stayed almost completely away from racially charged material, which has gotten her backlash in the past — although she did point out the irony of performing in front of a predominantly white audience at the Apollo, a noted venue for African-American performers.\n What's a bit unfortunate about the timing of the special is that it was filmed in late May, six weeks before Trainwreck was released and became an immediate juggernaut. Schumer was everywhere this summer — when she kicked off her set with the obligatory \"It's been an incredible year for me!\" she clearly meant it — which meant that she did a lot of press that addressed some of the key issues in her standup about being a woman in Hollywood in general, and being a not-super-skinny actress in particular. It's not that those bits and stories felt stale, exactly, but they did feel familiar, which was a little unfortunate, since they took up a solid portion of the hour.\nAs an aside: I did immediately wonder what her admission that she looked at every single photo that leaked in the 2014 iCloud hack might do to her newfound spot on Jennifer Lawrence's squad, given how violating J. Law found all that?\nThe set was at its best when Schumer got real about sex, although she was quick to point out the double standard between male comics who talk about sex and women who do the same. \"I'm labeled a sex comic … A guy could come up here and literally whip his dick out and people would be like, 'He's a thinker.' But then I mention one UTI and everybody just thinks I walk around leaving a snail trail of cum.\" (She sells that joke even harder by following it up with a poker faced, \"Cum is unsettling, isn't it?\" and following that with a celebration of all cum has to offer.)\nSchumer goes on to explore that double standard further, as it applies to our culture's weird certainty that men want all the sex, all the time, and women aren't interested. \"Women wanna cum! What girls are having sex, like, 'Oh no, I'm just — I'm just honored to be witnessing your process. It's just so cool. No, I don't want to feel the one good thing we're allowed to feel as humans! This is just you.' Make your girl cum, guys.\" A-fucking-men, Schumer. This leads to an audience participation bit about nicknamed sex acts, which leads to a young man explaining \"The Angry Dragon\" while sitting next to his mother .\nBut what stuck with me most were the smaller moments, like Schumer describing losing her two front baby teeth and getting her first period in the same week as a fifth grader. I loved her tiny admission that she's walked out of multiple movies just after the previews ended, because she was done with her popcorn (although, fine, maybe that's not totally true). I laughed out loud when Schumer announced that one of her 2014 resolutions was to \"take off a pair of underwear and have it not look like I blew my nose in it,\" and laughed even harder when she went on to reassure listeners that most of her day-old underwear looks the movie Charlotte's Web was shot in it. \"Salutations!\" (Weirdly, this was one of a full four references to children's/young adult literature peppered in throughout the set, so I like to think that Schumer was looking out for the nerds.) And while this wasn't technically a part of the set, I love that she hugged her sister immediately before and after she performed.\nUltimately, what the special drove home for me is that while Amy Schumer is wonderful at standup, and it's where she started out (she mentions at one point during the set that she's been traveling as a comic for over 11 years), it's not even the best thing she does. Standup doesn't compare to, say, the elaborate, collaborative, scripted episode of Inside Amy Schumer that explored Amy's fuckability, 12 Angry Men -style. Work like that is where Schumer has eclipsed her so many of her peers, and it's what I'm always wanting more of from her. But I was more than happy to watch Live at the Apollo in the meantime.\n​Follow Lauren on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/L_Hoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"], "published": "2015-10-18T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:35:38.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
