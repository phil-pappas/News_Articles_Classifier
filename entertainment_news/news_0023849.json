Show More Local Real Estate \nX FACTOR viewers took to social media last night to complain about the lack of grunt behind the show's rock week. \nAnd judge Guy Sebastian agrees with them. \nSebastian and Chris Isaak both came under fire last night for questionable song choices for their acts: The Temper Trap's Sweet Disposition for Matt & Jess and Lenny Kravitz's It Ain't Over Til It's Over for Cyrus Villanueva. \n\"If I'm being honest I hate the whole genre thing,\" Sebastian told APN. \n\"I think something like rock week, especially when there's a live band and it's very themed, it feels like it's not very genuine. It's like we're forcing people in a box. I've always been pretty open that I don't like these really specific themed weeks. I feel like we're playing dress-ups. \n\"You end up forcing people who aren't rock 'n' roll at all to look a bit stupid.\" \nBut Sebastian believes it's up to the contestants to rise to the challenge of any song and make it their own. \n\"You've got to adapt to it,\" he said. \n\"Even if it was the big bad corporate TV show, which it's not, that's forcing you to sing something you can still do a good job. \n\"I've always been so appreciative of (Idol), despite having to play dress-ups and do stuff I didn't want to do. On the flip side I was happy to get that publicity and get a springboard to launch my career.\" \nLast night's live performance show also featured a fiery exchange between Isaak and James Blunt, which resulted in Isaak telling Blunt to \"shut up\" as host Luke Jacobz hurried to an ad break. \n\"Chris just literally turned around and wouldn't look at James, but then in the next ad break they hugged it out,\" Sebastian said. \n\"It was pretty full-on. They really like each other but they obviously had a bit of a moment last night.\" \nSebastian also shed light on how much control the X Factor judges get over song choice, which has been a contentious topic over the past few weeks. \n\"When it comes to the producers' song choices versus the judges' song choices, the producers just suggest stuff,\" he said. \n\"They're not forcing the judges to do anything. \n\"In saying that, they've got to put on a show. If you get your song choices in late and you've got three acts and you all want big ballad moments, it might be tough luck if the other judges have already locked in their ballads. \n\"You can't have a show that's too ballad heavy. Those are the black and white logistics of putting together a show. You have to have some balance and some order.\" \nAnother singer will be eliminated from the show's live decider tonight at 7.30pm on Channel 7. chris isaak", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:05:29.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
