Vanna White's family recipe for banana pudding is in the book along with other personal recipes. \"It was so much fun working with Pat and Vanna, as well as the whole Wheel of Fortune team on this book. Their passion for food is obvious. I really think we captured it in this book,\" says Mr. Food Test Kitchen COO Howard Rosenthal .\nPat Sajak loves the idea that this book will make viewers more intimate with the show. He says, \"Over the years, I have eaten more than my share of dishes on the show, and each time I do, I think I have the best job in the world. I just wish Vanna would stop sneaking food off my plate when I'm not looking.\"\nVanna White says that she never sneaks food-she shares it. \"For me food is all about sharing. So the fact that I can share some of my favorite foods with viewers is very exciting and personal,\" she says.\nRECIPE EXAMPLES:\nWheely Good Mac & Cheese A-B-C D-licious Veggie Soup Pat's Perfect Pizza Pie Spinning Sugar Pinwheels Stacked Spin-tacular Party Cake PUBLICATION INFORMATION\nTitle: Mr. Food Test Kitchen – Wheel of Fortune Collectible Cookbook\nPages: 252\nRetail Price: $21.95\nWhere to Buy: WheelOfFortune.com, MrFood.com, Barnes & Noble, QVC, Amazon.com or wherever books are sold.\nBook Trailer: Click here for a sneak peek video.\nMore about Mr. Food Test Kitchen: http://mrfood.co/\nFor recipe photos click here.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151026/FL38211\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wheel-of-fortune-launches-collectible-cookbook-300166121.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
