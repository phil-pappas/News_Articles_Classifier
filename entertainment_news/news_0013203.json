The only explanation I can think of for the Cars getting the nod is the band landed atop the Boston 101 list . Or maybe last year's rant about Sting ( Sting!! ) making the cut over the Cars did it.\nWhatever the reason, the Hub’s best band between ‘77 and ‘85 may finally get called up.\nThe other nominations for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Class of 2016 are Chicago, Cheap Trick, Deep Purple, the Cars, Janet Jackson, N.W.A, Nine Inch Nails, the Smiths, Yes, Chaka Khan, Chic, The J.B.'s, Los Lobos, Steve Miller and the Spinners. The top vote-getters will be announced in December and inducted in April at a bash in New York City.\nWhile the Cars show the Rock Hall has finally spent time listening to Boston talent, it’s curious the J. Geils Band has been snubbed again. What's Cheap Trick got that J. Geils doesn't? I actually like Los Lobos more, but in the grand scheme of things, are they more deserving? Is Deep Purple more important than Geils in the history of rock?\nI freely admit my bias leans toward Boston. But with love and logic on my side, I have a few changes to make to the Hall's calls this year.\nGeils over Los Lobos -- but let's make sure Los Lobos gets the nod soon.\nNine Inch Nails can be part of the Class of 2020, or maybe 2025. The Pixies come first. The band almost invented the hardcore art rock we now call grunge (with credit also going to Sonic Youth, Husker Du and fellow Mass. rockers Dinosaur Jr.).\nThe band Boston comes before Cheap Trick -- and I really like Cheap Trick. But Boston had more sales, better hooks and bigger innovations: “More Than a Feeling,” “Piece of Mind” or “Foreplay/Long Time.”\nI don't have the heart to argue against Janet Jackson, Chicago or the Smiths. But I have the smarts tell the Rock Hall it overlooked Boston’s best again.", "external_links": ["http://www.rockhall.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:40:59.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
