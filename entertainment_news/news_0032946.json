She worked in Chicago theater on a few additional projects, but then she caught the Europe bug and headed across the pond. \nFast forward more than a decade and Schuch, who now lives in London with her husband, writer, filmmaker and VHX artist Konstantinos Koutsoliotas, has returned for a brief stay in Chicago. The occasion is the first screening here of Koutsoliotas’“The Winter,” an acclaimed indie film already seen at many major film festivals, and on which Schuch served as production designer, co-writer and producer. A scene from the Greek film, “The Winter,” to be screened on Oct. 11 as part of the Chicago Greek Film Festival. \nAn exceedingly beautiful fantasy thriller, “The Winter” will be screened as part of the Chicago Greek Film Festival on Sunday, Oct. 11 at 7:45 p.m. at the Skokie Theatre, 7924 Lincoln Ave., Skokie. It spins the tale of Niko, a romantic young Greek writer living in London. Heavily in debt, he escapes London and returns to his abandoned family home in the remote Greek mountain town of Siatista. Once there, he finds himself surrounded by ghosts of the past, and, as he seeks to uncover the mysterious circumstances of his father’s death he also struggles to retain his grasp on reality. \nSchuch, born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, earned a degree in scenic design at the Theatre School of DePaul University, assisted veteran Chicago designer Brian Sidney Bembridge, and worked on a number of independent films. Mesmerized by a book of architectural renderings she spied in a bookstore, she pursued the artist – Russian architect Sergei Tchoban – and spent a year working gratis in his Berlin office in exchange for special coaching sessions in the art of brown ink sketching. She then went on to the graduate program at the Glasgow School of Art, where she studied computer animation techniques. \nWith specialties that include drawing storyboards for 3D animation and matte painting for VFX, illustration inspired by theater and architecture, and the creative re-use of materials in scenic design, Schuch has put her talents to work in Warsaw, Ljubljana and Athens as well as London. She will begin work soon on a film of her own – a story to be shot in Wisconsin that is set in a haunted convent and features an all-female cast. \n“The Winter,” which debuted at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, received a Greek Academy Award nomination, and has since been seen at festivals throughout Europe, in New York and San Francisco, and in Brazil and Australia, was produced on a tiny budget with the help of Kickstarter funding to cover the cost of the crew’s international travel. And all this took place in October, 2013 when Greece was in the early stages of political and economic chaos. A scene from “The Winter,” to be screened Oct. 11 as part of the Chicago Greek Film Festival. \nSchuch, who has been collaborating with Koutsoliotas since 2004, has worked on everything from TV commercials and live circus design, to music videos and scripts. In 2011 the pair formed Melancholy Star “a boutique video effects, art and film studio based in London. \nFor a full lineup of the festival visit: www. greekfilmfestchicago .org/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:02:44.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
