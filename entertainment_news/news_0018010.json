The national-level event had bands from 15 states. The NHS band showcased new uniforms while earning an “excellent” rating. This is a division higher than what was achieved last year. The band’s score also was significantly higher and was within a point of many large band programs in the state. The band watched a number of performances that included past national champions, past national finalists and the current national champion. The band will compete this weekend in Kansas City.
