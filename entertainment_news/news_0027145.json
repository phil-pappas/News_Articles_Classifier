I think I've been pregnant 15 times!\" But last year, she found herself the subject of a gay romance rumor after tabloids posted photos of her and Cara Delevingne getting handsy (and maybe appearing to kiss) in bathing suits. And she was into the gossip.\n \"Honestly, I loved it,\" she told the outlet. \"I didn't mind it. Especially because they weren't talking about other people in my life for once, which was wonderful. Honestly, though, [Cara]'s incredible and very open, and she just makes me open. She's so fun and she's just extremely adventurous, and sometimes I just want that in my life, so I didn't mind it. I loved it.\"\nBird\nA photo posted by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Jul 24, 2014 at 9:36pm PDT\nMore From Cosmopolitan Selena says she has questioned her sexuality at points. \"Oh, I think everybody does, no matter who they are. I do, yeah, of course. Absolutely. I think it's healthy to gain a perspective on who you are deep down, question yourself and challenge yourself; it's important to do that.\"\nShe has a \"long list\" of dream onscreen lady love interests, starting with Suki Waterhouse ​. But these days, she owes much of her r eal love-life activity to her gay guy friends. \"Part of the reason I probably went out on a few dates is because of them. They're just like, 'Go! Go!' I'm like, 'No!' They're all about it, for sure.\" They double as her matchmakers: \"Whoever I'm with or like or don't like, they're all about dissecting it and putting me with other people.\"\nSo, guys, if you want to get with Selena Gomez, you've really got to get with her friends .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/q3GCq_OjKt/", "http://oceanup.com/2014/07/25/selena-gomez-and-cara-delevingne-coming-out-picture-holding-hands-are-they-dating/#.Vh-pn42pqHQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJLIiF15wjQ", "http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=73605"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:36:03.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
