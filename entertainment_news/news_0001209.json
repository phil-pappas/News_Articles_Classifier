The work can be seen, and bid on, in the downtown Rockland gallery. \nRockland — Along with many businesses in the city, in observance of October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, Black Hole is displaying purple in its window in support of New Hope for Women's work to end domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. \nArtist Orlando Johnson has created a quartet of his iconic lobsters in purple and the gallery is auctioning the piece, “Lobster Quartet: Purple,” over the course of the month, donating all proceeds from its sale to New Hope for Women. \nJohnson said the intention with this initiative is not only to raise what the gallery can to help the organization and the crucial work they do, but also to offer a visual representation of its support for New Hope for Women and, crucially, to the people it helps. \n“Art has the potential to reach far beyond the artists who make it, the galleries who show it, and the collectors who buy it. I hope this initiative can, even in a small way, promote awareness and positive change,\" Johnson said. \nHe cited the example of late artist Jamien Morehouse who, years ago, established an annual Christmas “Hat Show” to benefit New Hope for Women. \n“Her work was, and remains, a great influence on mine. I never had the chance to meet her, but feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to follow the wonderful example she set with a project like this,\" he said. \n“Lobster Quartet: Purple” will be displayed in the window at Black Hole, 403 Main St., through Saturday, Oct. 31. Bids can be accepted online at blackholegallery.com , as well as in person or via telephone.
