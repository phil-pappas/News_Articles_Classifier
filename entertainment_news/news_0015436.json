Nina Metz Contact Reporter Chicago Closeup Millennium Park to host free screening of \"Little Shop of Horrors\" Saturday. \nLift up your head, wash off your mascara: 1986's \"Little Shop of Horrors\" comes to Millennium Park for a free outdoor screening on Halloween. \nAdapted from the adapation of the stage musical of the same name about a plant with a taste for human blood, the movie version stars Rick Moranis as the bespectacled flower shop worker Seymour, Ellen Greene as the baby-voiced, plantinum-haired object of his affection Audrey, and Steve Martin as the dentist with a talent for causing pain (\"People will pay you to be inhumane!\" goes one of the more gleeful lyrics). \nThe screening is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Saturday at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion. Temperatures are expected to reach a high of only 57 degrees, so you might want to consider bringing a blanket or two and a thermous filled with something hot.

I did a deep-dive into the movie's origins and its sing-a-long history a few years back, which you can read about here .
