That brings its domestic total to $108 million and puts \"The Martian\"'s worldwide box office sum at $227 million after just two weeks. \nPraise from critics and audience word of mouth has lead to a very strong second weekend for the sci-fi thriller, which had just a 32% drop in ticket sales. \nTaking the No. 2 spot again is \"Hotel Transylvania 2,\" bringing in an estimated $20 million and managing to spend a third straight week in the top three. \n\"Hotel Transylvania 2\" is quickly creeping up Adam Sandler's list of highest-grossing movies. After just three weeks at the box office, the animated sequel has a $116 million domestic total. (Video via ScreenSlam ) \nThe highest-grossing film of Sandler's career right now is 1999's \"Big Daddy,\" which brought in $163 million domestically. \nTaking a very, very expensive third place bow is \"Pan,\" bringing in an estimated $15 million in its first week out. \nExpensive because \"Pan\" cost the folks at Warner Bros. just over $150 million to produce, the second most expensive movie the studio has released this year right behind \"Jupiter Ascending,\" which cost more than $176 million and also bombed its opening weekend. \nTo go along with the lack of ticket sales, there is an abundance of bad reviews. \n\"For a movie that clearly required a lot of time, consideration, and effort, Pan ends up feeling rather slapdash,\" IGN's Josh Lasser said. \nOr to put that another way. \"This joyless, juiceless Pan is a theme-park ride from hell,\" Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:37:34.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
