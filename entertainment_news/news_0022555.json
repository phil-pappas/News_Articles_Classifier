The transport body is planning to introduce new measures that could spell the end of Uber services in London in their current form.The proposals would allegedly include banning operators from showing available cars for hire on smartphone maps, while a minimum five-minute wait time between ordering a private hire vehicle and its arrival could also be introduced.Uber has started up an online petition against the measures, which it claims \"make no sense\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:41:51.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
