And now, the majestic Dame Helen Mirren has won the title of most empowering female celebrity. The 70-year-old was picked because women love how down-to-earth she is and how she embodies female empowerment.The 2,000 women polled by Lil-Lets said they admired her for rocking a red bikini in photographs when she was 63, and for unashamedly wolfing down a burger just a few hours after her Oscar win in 2006… while still in full gown and make up. What a woman. \n© Sipa Press/REX Shutterstock \nHelen tucked into a burger after her '06 Oscar win She was followed by J K Rowling - who was chosen because she wrote her best-selling Harry Potter books while a single mother on benefits.Other fabulous women we love are Michelle Obama (those arms!), singer-songwriter Adele and World Championship gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill, who won the heptathlon in Beijing just a few months after giving birth.Empowered female celebs also make us feel more confident about our looks, according to 55 per cent of the women polled. \n© Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/WENN.com \nJ K Rowling came second in the poll Surprisingly, Dame Helen pipped younger, more \"hip\" celebs to the post, with Angelina Jolie coming in sixth place, followed by Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Watson and Taylor Swift.Mary Young, who works for Lil-Lets, told The Daily Express : \"Women in the public eye can make a real difference to how others lead their lives.\"By seeing our idols and people we look up to doing and saying what they believe in, it can give women the confidence to do the same. They can help to make things that many are too shy or ashamed to do seem more acceptable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:43:03.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
