I don’t know how much I’ve seen of myself and I’m living with myself. You know, depending on the situation I’m in, depending on how scared I am or how insecure I feel at any given moment, I see another side of myself revealed and that’s what you see with Annalise. \n“I’m one of those actors: I don’t want structure, I don’t want to be put in a box, I don’t know how many years we’re going to be doing this show but I kind of want something that’s looser. I think she’s an endless bowl of surprises.” \nDavis returns as Keating in the second series, a ruthless criminal defence lawyer and professor at a prestigious Philadelphia university who becomes entwined in a murder plot along with five of her students.

That’s what I feel, like I can do what I do. Whereas if someone just gives me four adjectives to play: warm, funny, likeable, then I just feel like every choice I make has to fit into those little cubes and if they don’t then I’m doing something wrong. \n“I don’t think that’s how we operate as human beings. I think we are everything that’s messy and ugly and beautiful and likeable and unlikeable at the same time,” she added. The main cast of How To Get Away With Murder (ABC/Bob D’Amico) \n“Messy” is an appropriate adjective for the situation that the characters find themselves in at the end of series one: no sooner is one murder is solved, another body turns up. But Davis will not allow herself to be drawn into giving away any spoilers. \n“I will say this, it starts off with a bang. As soon as I feel like I don’t know where the writers are going to go from here, they go some place that is so exciting and intriguing and, even if it’s something that people may not believe, I tell you as an actor, it’s awfully fun to play,” she said.
