Her energy was undeniable, as was her megawatt star power. \nIt was such an impressive start that, after only five minutes, it seemed fair to wonder if the concert had already peaked. I mean, could it get any better than that? \nThe answer was yes. It could. And it did. \nWelch seemed to crank it up another notch (or two) with basically every song, resulting in a 100-minute thrill ride that won't soon be forgotten. \nYou can, however, forget what you think you know about Florence Welch from listening to the English rock band's three albums — 2009's \"Lungs,\" 2011's \"Ceremonials\" and this year's chart-topper \"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful.\" Those studio outings are all solid efforts, yet they still don't properly prepare you for how amazing Welch and pals are in concert. \nFlorence and the Machine rolled like thunder through the first part of the show, rapidly delivering outstanding performances of both new songs (\"Ship to Wreck,\" \"Third Eye\") and old favorites (\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\" \"Shake It Out\"). The Machine was every bit as mighty as its leader, with as many as five backing vocalists and six instrumentalists coming together to create one rich rocker after another. Advertisement \nThe band — which was also to perform a sold-out show at the same 8,500-capacity venue on Thursday — really did an outstanding job with the new material, highlighting why \"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful\" became the band's first No. 1 record in America and deserved its nomination for the 2015 Mercury Prize (awarded to the best album in the U.K.). \nWelch did a good job interacting with the crowd, making small talk about hats, hangovers and a variety of other subjects. She also ran out into the audience at one point, stopping at the soundboard to fully unveil her towering vocals. Later in the evening, she'd cheekily ask her faithful fans to remove pieces of clothing. Some actually complied, showering the persuasive singer with garments as she paced the stage with both purpose and poise. \nHowever, Welch had already illustrated her persuasive powers earlier on, getting these so-very 21st century fans to consider a nearly inconceivable proposition. \n\"For this next song, I'm going to ask something controversial — to put your phones away,\" she said. \nAnd, amazingly, they did — thus disproving the hypothesis that smartphones are somehow surgically attached to everyone's hands. \nWelch brought the main set to a close in fine fashion, roaring into \"Mother\" (arguably the new album's top tune) and sending fans into a frenzy with the hit \"Dog Days Are Over.\" The segment peaked with a powerful \"Spectrum,\" as Welch pleaded repeatedly, \"Say my name.\" \nTruth be told, she really doesn't have to worry when it comes to that request. She'll so supremely talented that people should be chanting Florence Welch's name for years to come. \nFollow Jim Harrington at twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:01:40.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
