That was my favorite scene in the movie,\" De Niro said. \n\"It's an expression of admiration, just to be clear,\" Hiddleston said. \"I do impressions of people I admire.\" \nHe added, \"This is so meta. I feel like I've gone into a parallel universe.\" \nThe episode also included Hiddleston's impression of the host himself, as well as Branagh's impression of Ian McKellen as Gandalf in \"Lord of the Rings.\" Norton also teased Hiddleston about his massive fan base, known as the Hiddlestoners. \nSee Hiddleston do his best Hank Williams in this clip for upcoming biopic \"I Saw the Light.\" He can next be seen in Guillermo del Toro's \"Crimson Peak,\" which bows in theaters Oct. 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:46:06.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
