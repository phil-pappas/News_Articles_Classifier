Last week, the Golden Tornadoes led No. 11 Thomas More until the final seconds of the first half and went into halftime trailing 9-7. But Thomas More came out after the break and dominated, winning 44-14. \nInside the playbook: Case Western is a well-rounded team that ranks second in the conference in scoring offense and scoring defense. Quarterback Rob Cuda is second in passing (260.0 yards per game) and seventh in rushing (89.2). For Geneva, quarterback Aaron Channing ranks fourth in the conference in passing with 186.8 yards per game and Dylan Jones is ninth in rushing (48.8). \nKey player: The Geneva defense will need to slow Case Western’s offense, and junior Jimmy Quinlan led Geneva with 18 tackles last week. \nKey stat: Case Western’s Cody Calhoun averages 28.2 yards per kickoff return, which ranks first in the conference. Geneva’s Noah Wertz averages 57.8 yards per kickoff and limits opponents’ starting position to the 29-yard line.
