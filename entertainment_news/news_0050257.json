In fact I can even say that the film carries partial nudity also.\"\nWith 'Darling Don't Cheat' a gripping tale of dark intentions and reality, the artistes' involvement with the script have made them push their limits.\n\"Stripping scenes were not a demand of director, but a demand of the script. So when story demands something, I don't think there were any qualms about being uncomfortable,\" she said.\nThe film is a suspense thriller against the backdrop of a mean man brutalizing a group of girls by confining and asking them to strip. Neha plays an ambitious actress who is ready to go to any lengths to achieve success and fame.\nThe film, directed and produced by Rajkumar Hindusthani under the banner Fyeo Media Works, is slated to release on October 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:00:49.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
