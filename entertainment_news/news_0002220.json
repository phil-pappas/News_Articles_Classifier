Chances are you've seen toddlers riding around or being pushed by their mothers in Little Tikes cars. The traditionally yellow and red plastic vehicles cost around fifty dollars and come in themes ranging from police cars to princess vehicles.\nJohn Bitmead of the United Kingdom decided to create an adult-size replica of a Little Tikes car, which runs on gas and goes 70 miles per hour, the BBC reported.\nSo, how much does a slice of childhood cost these days? The car's price on eBay, is listed as Â£21,500 or a little over $33,000.\nBitmead created the vehicle by modifying a Daewoo Matiz vehicle in 2013, with the help of his brother Geoff.\n\"What a wonderful idea to make something like that [Little Tikes car], but real,\" he told BBC.\nIt was important for him to maintain the look of the original car, with the same color scheme, and no windows, BBC reported. So, probably not the best vehicle to drive in the rain.\nFollow @MaryBowerman on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-34526827", "http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/The-original-Little-Tikes-based-road-legal-road-going-real-Crazy-Coupe-toy-car-/281807841142?afsrc=1&rmvSB=true"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:14:03.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
