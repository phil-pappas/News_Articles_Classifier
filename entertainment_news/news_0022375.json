Until Friday in Scotland, when we learned that she's no fan of motorbikes. \nPrince William and his wife (known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when they're in Scotland) were in Dundee for a day of engagements focused on mental health and anti-bullying projects, which both young royals have embraced among their charitable causes. \nKate, who stunned in a scarlet Jenny Packham gown at her first Buckingham Palace state banquet on Tuesday night, then stunned again in a plum lace Dolce&Gabbana dress at a cultural event on Wednesday in London, did not disappoint the crowds of fans who greeted her in Dundee: \nShe stood out in a royal-blue, slim-fitting houndstooth wool tailored coat and houndstooth mini wool kilt by Scottish designer Christopher Kane, paired with a black turtleneck sweater and black sued boots, according to the blogs that track her fashion.

She reacted with delight to a little girl who had on a mask of grandmother-in-law Queen Elizabeth II, according to the Express ' royal reporter on the scene. \nDuchess Kate greets fans on visit to Dundee, Scotland, on Oct. 23, 2015.

Then another well-wisher asked her if Will was still riding his motorbike. \n\"He's still riding it,\" she said. \"It always fills me with horror when he goes out on it. I'm terrified. Hopefully, I'm going to keep George off it.\" \nGood luck with that, Kate. \nBesides helping to de-stigmatize discussion of mental health awareness, today's five-event day in Dundee also offered an chance to return to the university city where the two first met as undergrads more than a decade ago: St. Andrews, where the couple spent Thursday night at the Old Course Hote l and enjoyed a romantic meal.
