This is not only harmful to the affected individuals and their families but sends the wrong message to all those who wonder if our city's leadership truly is committed to creating good family-supporting jobs in our city.\"\nAFSCME represents about 50 of the 73 budgeted workers at the 311 center.\nEmanuel's idea to privatize 311 seemed, from the moment he mentioned it during his September budget speech, to be a good candidate to be removed from his final plan. He isn't counting on any savings from the privatization in his 2016 budget, and even if the work was privatized, the savings to the city would only be about $1 million annually, according to the mayor. His main logic behind privatizing the call center was that it would cost too much for the city to make necessary technology upgrades.\nBut from the start, council members questioned whether it made sense to put control of a service that so many Chicagoans use in the hands of a private company that could employ workers unfamiliar with the city.\nAldermen criticize Emanuel 311 privatization plan John Byrne and Bill Ruthhart Aldermen expressed serious misgivings Wednesday about Mayor Rahm Emanuel's proposal to privatize the city's 311 call center, worrying the service would suffer if it is put in the hands of workers unfamiliar with Chicago and wondering whether a private operator could end up costing more than keeping...\nAldermen expressed serious misgivings Wednesday about Mayor Rahm Emanuel's proposal to privatize the city's 311 call center, worrying the service would suffer if it is put in the hands of workers unfamiliar with Chicago and wondering whether a private operator could end up costing more than keeping...\n(John Byrne and Bill Ruthhart) By backing down, Emanuel can make the case he listened to aldermen's concerns in crafting his final budget, as he has by compromising on small parts of his spending package in past years.\njebyrne@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Unions Rahm Emanuel", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56279d1a/turbine/ct-emanuel-afscme-311-privatization-letter-met-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c5a56/turbine/ct-chicago-city-council-budget-hearing-met-1001-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:22:38.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
