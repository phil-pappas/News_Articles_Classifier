Specifically, the time from 2007 to 2015 saw a decrease in independent store sales while multi-store chains of any size, as well as department stores, all saw gains. According to Los Angeles diamond retailer Louis Saint Dupont, while their own sales gains as an independent retailer have been notably healthy, this is likely due to the fact that they have what many other single-store retailers do not: an online presence.\nLouis Saint Dupont notes that the most interesting aspects of the data, which was collected and distributed by De Beers, were in regards to online vs. brick and mortar sales. They highlight the fact that, while the period between 2007 and 2015 saw a 21 percent decrease in overall sales through single-store channels, the percent of the market share that those stores have in terms of in-person brick and mortar sales has actually increased by two percent. In fact, Louis Saint Dupont explains that the majority of the changes throughout the past eight years have been driven by Americansâ€™ desire to do more and more of their shopping online.\nLouis Saint Dupont explains that, while certainly some of their regular customers enjoy the online shopping options available at http://www.LouisSaintDupont.com , other customers still appreciate the in-person experience of shopping in their Los Angeles showroom. They note that the advantage that individual businesses have over the national chains is that their pieces typically have generally more original designs made by artisans who have more time to focus on each piece. For these innovative and beautiful designer pieces, an in-person look is often the only way to fully appreciate and absorb every facet and feature of the design.\nLouis Saint Dupont concludes by noting that, while it is now the responsibility of other individual retailers to keep up with the times and provide customers with the online resources they desire, it is also important for these customers to shop with independent stores whenever available, to preserve the artisanal traditions of small business. Variety in how to buy is just one of the many things that Louis Saint Dupont offers their customers.
