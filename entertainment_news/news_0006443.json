They're 3-4 and have a good chance to get to 4-4 next Sunday with a game at Dallas against a Cowboys' team that will play without an injured Tony Romo.\nThen they head into the bye week to rest and get ready for a three-game homestand against Arizona, San Francisco and Pittsburgh. The Seahawks will be favored in those games and, in fact, won't be an underdog until the last game of the season against the Cardinals in Glendale.\nYou can also look at how impressive the defense was, snuffing out the 49ers, who had more punts than first downs. And Marshawn Lynch re-booted Beast Mode to the tune of 122 punishing rushing yards as the offense finally resembled Seattle Super Bowl teams from the past .\nThe Go 2 Guy also writes for 710Sports.com and kitsapsun.com.

To take it one step farther, if the Seahawks beat the Cowboys, they could tie or move within one game of the NFC West-leading Cardinals when they host Arizona on Nov. 15.\nI'm hopeful, too, but I'm also cynical, skeptical, pessimistic and realistic, which no doubt comes from years as a sportswriter and decades as a Coug fan.\nSo let's be honest here. As much as we'd like to think the Seahawks are now on the right track and could win the NFC West and make a third straight trip to the Super Bowl, it's not going to happen. This year isn't last year, and it's not two years ago either.\nThe Seahawks have defeated three terrible teams and lost to four good teams, three of which are unbeaten. The terrible teams – Chicago, Detroit and San Francisco – have a combined record of 5-14.\nEntering Thursday night's game, the 49ers were 30th in total offense and 31st in total defense , and there are only 32 teams in the league.\nSo yes, the Seahawks did what they were supposed to do, and it would've been much worse if they hadn't. But beating up on a sad sack former rival doesn't mean they're suddenly contenders again.\nBefore the season, I wrote in a seattlepi.com column that the Seahawks would go 10-6 . I was roundly ripped for that prediction and as it turns out, the critics were right -- they'll probably go 9-7.\nThis year the Seahawks have already proven they don't measure up to elite teams such as Green Bay, Cincinnati and Carolina. In time, they could. By January, fourth-quarter issues in September and October may be long forgotten.\nBut even in best-case projections -- and keep in mind, since 1990 only 14 teams that started 2-4 made it to the playoffs -- the Seahawks will have to win three games on the road to get to the Super Bowl. That is dramatically different from two games at home, the path they took in 2013 and 2014.\nMore likely, this year's path will take the players to their offseason homes after the final regular season game at Arizona on Jan. 3.\nAs much as we want to think they're the same team that came within a shocking last-minute interception from winning two consecutive Super Bowls, they're not. Aside from the offensive line, I don't know why they're not.\nWhen I look at the Seahawks and the Cardinals, I'm reminded of the Seahawks and the 49ers from years past. The 49ers owned the division until the Seahawks finally broke through, but it took a while to get there. Now the Seahawks are the defending NFC West champs, but I sense that this is Arizona's break-through year.\nWe all want to believe Tom Cable when the assistant head coach tells us the players on the offensive line are the best group he's ever had, that it's just going to take time for them to develop. Or something like that, I've lost track of what amounts to empty chatter right now.\nHere's the conundrum, if I'm even correct in my usage of that word -- while we're waiting for the linemen to improve, the problems they're having could prevent the Seahawks from having a good enough record to qualify for the playoffs. They might be ready to go in January with no one to block anymore.\nThen I thought, well, at least they'll be in great shape for next year. Maybe not – Russell Okung and J.R. Sweezy are in the last year of their contracts, and we might be having the same O-line discussion in 2016.\nIn hindsight, in an attempt to improve the offense by trading Max Unger for Jimmy Graham, the deal backfired. The Seahawks made it to two Super Bowls with Unger and WITHOUT Graham.\nThe 49ers had only nine sacks coming into the game and have 14 now. Wilson has been sacked 31 times and is on a pace for 70. Seventy! Seriously? We're tolerant because he's such a terrific scrambler, but as soon as he gets hurt and we're exposed to a steady dose of Tarvaris Jackson, we'll really see how much the O-line is holding this team back.\nThat's the main reason why 9-7 is more in play than 11-5 or 10-6, though it appears there are internal issues that could be a factor as well. I have no idea what they are or if they even exist, but something with this team is missing. Perhaps the players who got paid have lost some of their hunger and drive. Maybe there are jealousies from players who think they should be making as much as other players. Then again, I could be reading too much into a situation I don't know enough about.\nWhatever the causes, there's too much adversity to overcome this year. Come January, I'm guessing we'll look back on the San Francisco game in October as a 60-minute exhibition of false hope.\nThe Go 2 Guy also writes for 710Sports.com and KitsapSun.com.
