They say new cost estimates for building and maintaining the 100-by-50 foot rink for the season come in around 15,000 dollars. Supporters say it could be a lot of fun and good for the economy.\n\"I think it would be a great way to bring people in from the community, get people together, it would be a good way to raise money for the state too,” said Eli Wilson, a supporter of the rink.\n\"Yes, yes, yes. Give Burlington a run for their money in terms of the capital fight,” said Bianca Rizzio, from Burlington.\n\"Yeah, who doesn't love ice skating, beautiful spot, yeah I could be down,” said Anna Shelley, a UVM Senior.\nOrganizers hope to have the rink open for three months a year starting with the holiday tree lighting. The bulk of the project would be paid for with donations and the rink would be insured by the city of Montpelier. The project still needs approval from the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:11:37.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
