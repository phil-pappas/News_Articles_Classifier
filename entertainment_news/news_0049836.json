By Luke Karmali \nMicrosoft has announced a new 1TB Xbox One bundle for this holiday season that also comes with a copy of Fallout 4 . \nThe bundle, available from November 10, will set you back Â£369 / $399 and comes replete with a copy of Bethesda's upcoming post-apocalyptic adventure, as well as a copy of Fallout 3. \nThe 1TB Xbox One Fallout 4 bundle will be available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK, U.S., Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. \nOver the weekend we found out how much room Fallout 4 will take up on Xbox One . While the game's file size is definitely big, it's maybe not as big as you were expecting. Compression techniques and clever use of assets could certainly help compact the game. A decent chunk of the 28GB required will be dedicated to dialogue, as Fallout 4 has more spoken lines than Skyrim and Fallout 3 combined. \nThe game's share of your hard drive will increase over time, as Bethesda has said regular updates will be part of Fallout 4 , updates that add new features in a similar vein to Skyrim. \nLuke Karmali is IGN UK News Editor .
