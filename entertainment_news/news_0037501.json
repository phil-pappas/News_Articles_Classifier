Photo: YouTube \nAnthropomorphism has always been big in children's television. In Australia, it is all about talking bananas. In Sweden, dancing tampons are the stars.\nChildren's channel Barnkanalen has released a video titled The Period Song , which features tampons dressed as pirates, kings and hippies, bouncing merrily from their strings like puppets beneath a makeshift mirror ball.\nSwedish public service broadcaster SVT says the video is designed to teach children about menstruation. Photo: YouTube \nYouTube star and television presenter Alex Hermansson strums a ukulele, while singing and rapping in Swedish, \"Period, period, hip hip hooray for period!\"\nAdvertisement He sings with a group of teenagers, cavorts on a basketball court and dances in front of a street mural decorated with red droplets. \"It's just a little blood,\" he sings, as a red spatter hits the screen.\n\"The body's working as it should. And that is really, really good â€“ hooray!\"\nAt the video's conclusion, Hermansson dips one of the bouncing tampons into a container of crimson liquid.\nThe song will air on Friday on the channel, which is part of the Swedish public service broadcaster SVT. The broadcaster has said the video aims to destigmatise menstruation and explain the subject to children.\n\"You should be able to talk about the most natural thing, as half the world's population is involved,\" head of programming for SVT, Petter Bragee told Sweden's  The Local. \nIt is not the first time the channel has caused a stir with its videos for children. Earlier this year it aired a video featuring a pair of dancing male and female genitals. Called  Snoppen och Snippan , which translates as Willie and Twinkle, the clip has been viewed more than six million times on YouTube.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:20:06.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
