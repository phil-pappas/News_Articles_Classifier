They are often referred by fans as \"Sukish\".\n\nSuyyash Rai and Kishwer Merchantt. Picture courtesy: Bigg Boss Twitter account @BiggBoss \n\"It is going to be difficult to be with each other in front of so many cameras all the time. There is no denying that we are too much in love, we have been very open about our relationship. So, even on the show we will be exactly the way we are in real life. We want to be the ideal couple on 'Bigg Boss',\" Suyyash told PTI.\nEchoing her boyfriend's sentiments, Kishwer, who is older to Suyyash by 7 years, said both of them want to show their best side to the audience.\n\"We have always been perceived as this cute couple. We want that side of us to come out on the show as well. I am not saying that we will not fight or have arguments but we will make up later. The audience will love to see that side,\" she said.\nIn a house full of strangers, Kishwer and Suyyash have a slight advantage as they have each other to fall back on during difficult times.\n\"That is a big relief for us. I am happy that we are together and we can take care of each other,\" Kishwer said. They, however, maintained that they will be competing as individuals.\n\"It is a game and even though we may be participating as a pair, we are both individuals and we will play like that. We both want to win the show,\" Kishwer said.\n\"Bigg Boss Nau\", hosted by Salman Khan, airs on Colors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:41:55.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
