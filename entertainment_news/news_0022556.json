Comments Simply outlining the evolution of art controversies from the \"culture wars\" of the 1990s through today's performance art provocations gives some idea of what a rich topic art controversy can be in the 21st century. \nWhy do certain works of art — like Manet's \"Olympia,\" or Eric Fischl's bronze sculpture of a woman jumping from the burning towers on 9/11, or graffitist BLU's Los Angeles mural showing dollar bills in coffins—ignite a firestorm of public controversy? \nOn Thursday evening, Oct. 22, Star-Ledger art critic Dan Bischoff will moderate a panel discussion at the Montclair Art Museum featuring former Newark Museum curator and international art advisor Joe Jacobs, activist artist Dread Scott, and Program Director for the National Coalition Against Censorship Svetlana Mintcheva that will try to answer that question. \nThe panel, which will be open to the public and invite audience participation, is one of three parts of \"Art in the Public Eye,\" a series of events sponsored by the Lennie Pierro Memorial Art Foundation with a grant from the New Jersey Council on the Humanities. Simply outlining the evolution of art controversies from the \"culture wars\" of the 1990s through today's performance art provocations gives some idea of what a rich topic art controversy can be in the 21 st century. \n\"Art in the Public Eye\" begins 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22, in the main auditorium of the Montclair Art Museum, 3 South Mountain Ave. in Montclair.
