And she knows it. \nInstead of dealing with the chaos escalating in her world, she \"glimmers\" out to another world - a very dark world. \nWhile escaping reality seems like a perfectly normal reaction for a young person, the darkened \"other world\" sequences when she blanks out in Sunnytown are frankly bizarre. \nFrom talking about frozen puppies to frantic itching to disappearing escalators preventing escape - it is peculiar and unexplainable. \nBut NIDA writer Krystal Sweedman's important message that we need to develop healthy coping mechanisms for expressing our emotions and pain so we are less likely to use alcohol and other substances to numb or distract ourselves from our feelings, is a worthy and earnest premise for a play. \nIt is important to support emerging artists like Sweedman and director Heather Fairbairn, to ensure talented people can find ways to communicate societal change and weave delicate topics through artistic works. \nSunnytown is one of four indie shows running at La Boite through till December 5. \nOne show is $28, two is $39, three is $57 and the season pass, for all four shows, is $74.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:09:14.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
