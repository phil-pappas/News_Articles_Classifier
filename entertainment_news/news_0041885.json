October 10: Not even two days are left for the first phase of Assembly elections in Bihar and the independent candidate has been shot by unknown miscreants in Madhubani district. Also in another shocking incident a time bomb was recovered near the gate of a rebel BJP legislator who is contesting as independent candidate, informed police. The first phase of elections are supposed to take place on October 12. \nThe shot independent candidate — Sunil Jha — is contesting the elections from Jhanjharpur Assembly seat in Madhubani district. He was shot by the unidentified criminals during robbery at his residence on Monday. Jha has been hospitalised. Though the police is tight lipped onto the proceeding of the case, but did not rule our the possibility of political rivalry. Speaking to IANS a police official said, ”It could be a part of political rivalry during the election. We are investigating into the case from all angles.” (Also Read: Narendra Modi: Lalu Prasad will remote control Bihar if grand alliance elected ) \nWhile in the second incident, a time bomb was defused after it was found near the office of Rashmi Verma, who was denied ticket by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was contesting as an independent from Narkatiaganj Assembly seat. Also the leader received a threat letter in which it was warned her not to contest elections. It is not the first time Verma had received such a letter, but last week too she got a letter in which it was said to her that she should not contest the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls as a rebel candidate, prompting her to lodge a complaint with the Sikarpur police station. The letter, according to her, also threatened that if she goes ahead and contests the polls, it will not be good for her children. \n  5:14 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:27:24.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
