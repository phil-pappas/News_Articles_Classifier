According to TMZ , these countries as well as Indonesia, which are dominated by Muslims, have banned the album as they take issue with the Canadian singer being shirtless in the artwork and flaunting the cross tattoo on his chest. However, it's still too soon for Beliebers in the countries to get bummed out. The site goes on to report that Bieber's team is currently working on an alternate album art although it's still unclear how the revamped cover will look like. \"Purpose\" is due out in the U.S. on November 13. Having spawned \"What Do You Mean?\" that peaked atop Billboard Hot 100, the album will battle for the No. 1 spot on the charts against One Direction 's \" Made in the A.M. \". The British boyband's fifth studio effort is scheduled to arrive on the same day. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:47:22.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
