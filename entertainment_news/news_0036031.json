I was like, 'That was hilarious.'\" \nThe 34-year-old Inside Amy Schumer star joked about marrying Cooper during her opening monologue on Saturday, and he revealed to the entertainment show that it wasn't the first time Schumer has used him as a foil. \n\"I remember I met her and then she was on a talk show and made up some story that I pretended to avoid her,\" he recalls. \"And when I saw her on the red carpet I was like, 'Hey man, you made up some bulls*** story,' and she was like, 'Oh I'm sorry.'\" \n\"So maybe she's making up for that now...cause I called her on it,\" he adds. \nThe American Sniper star is reportedly dating Russian supermodel Irina Shayk. \nCooper plays a top chef who tries to revive his career after it was destroyed by drugs and diva-like behavior in the film Burnt , opening nationwide October 23. \nSchumer stars in her first HBO comedy special on Saturday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
