The prizes for those three winners this year include thousands of dollars in cash and the opportunity to perform in Carnegie Hall. The musicians, ranging in age from 19-35, competed all day Tuesday and Wednesday, vying for a spot among eight semifinalists, and eventually, three finalists. \nFor the first rounds, each competitor played a 30-minute program, which consisted of pieces by Bach, Chopin, Liszt and other classical composers. \nSemifinalist announcements were made on Wednesday night, and the second rounds of the competition went on Thursday. \nNina Bakradze, from the country of Georgia, Solomon Eichner of Baltimore and Alexander Kostritsa of Russia sat together and anxiously awaited hearing the first deliberations. \nKostritsa, 27, said it wasn't the kind of anxiousness he felt before playing earlier in the day, though. \n\"It's a different kind of nervousness,\" Kostritsa said.

Bakradze, Eichner and Kostritsa all said that is something they welcomed. \n\"It's better with people,\" Bakradze, 31, said of competing. \"It feels more like a concert.\" \nBakradze also performed on Wednesday after two hours of warm-up time. She, much like the other 18 contestants, had spent most of her time in Louisiana so far recovering from jet lag and practicing as many hours as possible in hopes of advancing. \n\"Because you don't know,\" she said of who will make it past round one. \"If you pass, you need those hours.\" \nIn Bakradze's case, she did. She was among the eight semifinalists announced Wednesday night. The other seven included Moye Chen, Elisa D'Auri, Connie Kim-Sheng, Saetbyeol Kim, Hao Liu, Yuri Noh and Gregory Wang. \nAfter the announcement, all 19 contestants and the host families in whose homes they stayed were invited to a reception at the River Oaks Square Arts Center. \nBakradze suddenly had other plans, though. \n\"I will go practice right away,\" she said of what was next on her agenda. \nThe same went for the other semifinalists as well. That's just part of their recipe for success. \n\"Musicians don't eat, don't sleep, don't rest, and then they play,\" Bakradze explained with a laugh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:59:28.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
