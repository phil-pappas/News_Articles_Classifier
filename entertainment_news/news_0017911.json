Bruce Rauner and Democratic lawmakers spent Thursday trying to define the other's agenda as detrimental to the middle class as state government's political impasse is in its fourth month.\nRauner attempted to reframe the debate by arguing Democrats already have voted for various union-weakening proposals in recent years, nullifying their argument that they'd be violating a core principle if they approved his demands.\nBut state Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, a top deputy to powerful Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, contended Rauner wasn't elected to office with a mandate to \"destroy the middle class\" by weakening collective bargaining rights for unions.\nThe major difference of opinion is at the core of a stalemate that has left the state without a formal budget since July 1. Rauner has said proposals to allow state and local governments to forgo union bargaining of wages, hours, pensions and health insurance are a precondition for negotiating with Democrats on higher taxes to make up for state overspending.\nOn Thursday, Rauner said the state's gridlock was not about \"some personal dynamic between one politician and another,\" a reference to his dispute with Madigan.\nInstead, the governor said, the fight was \"about political tactics for the next election versus policies for the next generation\" as he insisted Democrats were more interested in protecting their political allies in organized labor than \"helping the middle class.\"\n\"The status quo in Illinois, protecting the way we're doing things in government, is not helping our middle class. A more expensive government bureaucracy does not help working families in this state. It does not help the middle class. Raising taxes, having a higher cost of living does not help the middle class. Chasing employers out of the state as we've been doing does not help the middle class,\" Rauner told reporters outside the launch of the Chicago Innovation Exchange at the University of Chicago.\nRauner said Democrats in the legislature have voted in the past to remove issues from collective bargaining with unions, particularly for requests made by Chicago Public Schools in dealing with the Chicago Teachers Union and other unions.\n\"Length of school day, length of school year, layoffs in Chicago teachers, whenever they needed something out (of collective bargaining), they take it out,\" the governor said. \"So when somebody argues to you (that) this is about a violation of the core principles of the Democratic Party, call it on them. Call them on it. It's not true. Simply not true. This is about political manipulation, political maneuvering, not about true genuine policy.\"\nBut Currie, after appearing at the same event, called Rauner \"Scott Walker-light,\" a reference to the Wisconsin Republican governor's move to eliminate collective bargaining rules with most public unions in that state.\n\"I don't think this governor ran for office on a Scott Walker program. He didn't say in advance of the election, 'I'd like to destroy the middle class. I'd like to get rid of collective bargaining.' That was not what got him elected,\" she said.\n\"The idea was, he was going to be a different governor from the one we had (with Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn). So all of a sudden he's behaving as if he has a mandate to do things that I don't think the electorate gave him,\" she said.\nCurrie said the state's skilled labor force was built as a result of organized labor and that \"Illinois has never been a state that has been at the bottom of the pack when it comes to issues like prevailing wages and collective bargaining.\"\nWith the rhetoric on both sides continuing and the governor's office and Democratic lawmakers still entrenched, Democratic state Sen. Kwame Raoul said the governor's demand to weaken collective bargaining rights was extreme.\nAsked if he could meet the governor halfway, the Chicago legislator said, \"It depends on what the premise is of what he wants. He could say he wants to put me in slavery, right? Should I meet him halfway? My point is, just because he's governor doesn't mean he could go to any extreme and say, 'That's a bargaining point.'\"\nRaoul, an African-American lawmaker, later told reporters that his intent was to point out that some items Rauner has dropped from his so-called Turnaround Agenda would never have gained support.\n\"If you just throw something on the wall that is to the extreme and say, 'OK, I'm dropping that now,' that's not a fair point of departure to say, 'I've negotiated,'\" Raoul said of Rauner. \"That said, I think that there has been efforts to meet the governor halfway on some of the issues that were part of his Turnaround Agenda.\"\nrap30@aol.com\nTwitter @rap30\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Bruce Rauner Democratic Party Scott Walker Kwame Raoul Barbara Flynn Currie Michael Madigan", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616e55e/turbine/ct-bruce-rauner-budget-met-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:22:49.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
