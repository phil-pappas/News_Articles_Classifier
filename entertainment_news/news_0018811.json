Never enough. 1D released the full track listing for \"Made In The A.M.\" on Snapchat, and it looks like we're promised 17 songs from the boy band's farewell album. The band is set to go on an extended hiatus in March . \nSo we should enjoy their antics together while we can. They're giving us a lot to work with. \nOur faves from across the pond made us laugh last week in the midst of their sold-out tour when Harry Styles stopped a concert for four minutes in order to hear the name of the 7-year-old he wanted to wish a happy birthday. (Video via Sony Music Entertainment / One Direction ) \nNice to know they're still smiling after Apple Music accidentally leaked the name of their next single, \"Perfect.\" Fans will get to hear that song first thing on Friday, which means we get a further sampling of what they've been teasing us with since August. (Video via Sony Music Entertainment / One Direction ) \n\"It's all quite different. There's a couple nice, slow, sort of usual One Direction songs on there. But we've taken a lot of inspiration from, like, older artists , I guess, which is like the Police feel on 'Drag Me Down,'\" explained Liam Payne on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in August. \nThe band's first single release from the new album, \"Drag Me Down,\" shattered Spotify records for one-day streams â€” it played 4.75 million times by 1.2 million One Direction fans worldwide. \nOne Direction's album is set for release Nov. 13, going head-to-head with Justin Bieber's album release date. It's sure to be a hair-flipping pretty-boy battle you better wear your skinny jeans for. \nFull track list for \"Made In The A.M.\": \n1. \"Hey Angel\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:02:30.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
