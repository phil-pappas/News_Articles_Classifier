Oct. 8, 2015 10:00 a.m. Leon Russell will perform Wednesday at Northern Lights Theater, Potawatomi Hotel & Casino. Mark Zaleski Lucinda Williams will perform Thursday at Pabst Theater. Rockabilly Circus 2 performs Friday at Northern Lights Theater, Potawatomi Hotel & Casino. Frazer Harrison Wild Belle will perform Monday at Turner Hall Ballroom. \nLUCINDA WILLIAMS \n8 p.m. Thursday, Pabst Theater, 144 E. Wells St. $39.50 at the box office, the Riverside Theater box office (116 W. Wisconsin Ave.), (414) 286-3663 and pabsttheater.org . \nLast year, Americana singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams launched her own label, Highway 20 Records. To mark the occasion, she released a new double album \"Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone\" to typical critical acclaim. It was Williams' 11th studio album from her nearly four-decade career. \nBut the relatively rare occasion that is a Lucinda Williams album, and the high quality of that output, has earned her plenty of deserved fanfare. \nTime Magazine once declared her \"America's best songwriter,\" an always polarizing declaration, but Williams' poetic phrasing, character and care she puts in her words make a strong case. Vanity Fair compared her to Bob Dylan, Hank Williams and Keith Richards (circa \"Exile on Main Street\") in reviewing her 2007 album \"West.\" \nAnd when she performed her entire catalog over a series of shows in 2007, Williams' reputation attracted the likes of Emmylou Harris, David Byrne, Yo La Tengo and other critical darlings. So what if only one album, 1998's \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,\" went gold? Fans would say her entire catalog is golden. \nBuick 6 — which was lucky to have a Williams guest appearance on its jazzy alternative country track \"So Much Trouble in the World\" — opens. \n— Piet Levy, plevy@journalsentinel.com \nSEETHER \n8 p.m. Friday, Eagles Ballroom, the Rave, 2401 W. Wisconsin Ave. $31 to $144 at the box office, (414) 342-7283 and therave.com . \nWhatever the historical significance of the grunge wave that came from Seattle in the 1990s, the ebbing of that wave didn't keep many a genuflector from surfing it while paying homage to late grunge progenitors like Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley. \nThe voice of Shaun Morgan, Seether frontman, has enough similarities to the voices of Cobain and Staley for him to seem as though he's their Pacific Northwest contemporary rather than a South African whose band didn't release its first album until the 21st century. \nMorgan's admission of alcoholism means he's less beholden to his addictions than his artistic forebears were, but he's held onto his angst through the most recent album, last year's \"Isolate and Medicate.\" The torn-cloth riffs and gut-shot rhythms also remain. \nSaint Asonia, a Canadian hard-rock band featuring members of Three Days Grace and Finger Eleven, and Within Reason, an Alabama band, will precede the headliner. \n— Jon M. Gilbertson, \nSpecial to the Journal Sentinel \nROCKABILLY CIRCUS 2 \n7 p.m. Friday, Northern Lights Theater, Potawatomi Hotel & Casino, 1721 W. Canal St. $25 to $35 at the box office, (800) 745-3000 and ticketmaster.com . \nIn March, Slim Jim Phantom — the Stray Cats drummer and revivalist of rockabilly, the 1950s rock 'n' roll subset — was in town with a \"Rockabilly Circus\" that included \"Let's Have a Party\" scorcher Wanda Jackson and revivalist redhead Kim Lenz. That show was popular enough to encourage a sequel. \nNear the top of the bill this time is Jack Scott, an Ontario native whose childhood in suburban Detroit toughened his voice for songs like 1958's \"Leroy.\" \nAlso appearing is Narvel Felts, who went from Missouri to a brief shot at Sun Records and, in the mid-1970s, scored a few hits with country ballads that showed his rockabilly background. \nOther players include Huelyn Duvall, whose 1958 single \"Little Boy Blue\" was one of Eddie Cochran's favorite songs; Marti Brom, a sassy singer who recorded her first material in 1992; and the Chris Casello Trio, led by a guitarist inspired by Chet Atkins, Link Wray and Les Paul. \n— Jon M. Gilbertson \nBEN CAPLAN \n7 p.m. Sunday, Shank Hall, 1434 N. Farwell Ave. $10 at the box office, (866) 468-3401 and ticketweb.com . \nAs Jeff Bridges proved in the fantasy-movie bomb \"Seventh Son,\" the combo of unkempt hair and shaggy beard can make a man behave and, indeed, speak differently: \"Oggle woggle foggle dragon,\" he said, or sounded as though he said, at one point in the action. \nBen Caplan is clearer than that as a singer, although his singing style — that of a spiritual nephew to Tom Waits, politer and less existence-addled than his \"uncle\" but no less in thrall to the celebration of grimness that runs through old-time vaudevillian folk music — hints that he works through encroaching mouthfuls of follicles. \nHis first LP, 2011's \"In the Time of the Great Remembering,\" gained him acclaim in Nova Scotia, the Canadian province where he makes his home, and his dark second LP, \"Birds With Broken Wings,\" follows SXSW and Australian appearances. Witness his boom and his beard. \n— Jon M. Gilbertson \nWILD BELLE \n8 p.m. Monday, Turner Hall Ballroom, 1040 N. 4th St. $12 in advance through the Pabst; $15 day of show. \nRight now, some writer is probably at work on the latest version of a cyclical jeremiad on the state of modern pop music. No matter whether it appears in print or on Grantland, it'll strike that worn-down key that laments the mix-and-match nature of said modernity. \nIn the meantime, we can get our groove on with the help of Wild Belle , a Chicago act whose brother, Elliot Bergman, mixes his Caribbean and funk leanings (from his band NOMO) to match up with the sister, Natalie Bergman, who's more into classic soul. \nThe results had chill-out effervescent charm on 2013's debut LP, \"Isles.\" The next one, \"Dreamland,\" is due next year; a single, \"Giving Up on You,\" signposts a move from bubbliness to ska bounciness. It mixes, it matches and it has fun. \nMilwaukee synth-pop band Canopies provides support. \n— Jon M. Gilbertson \n8 p.m. Wednesday, Northern Lights Theater, Potawatomi Hotel & Casino. $35 to $45. \nLeon Russell has a beard that might make the ZZ Top guys jealous. And, just maybe, they're a tiny bit envious of his career, too. \nSeventy years ago, when he was 3, Russell studied classical piano. \nWhen he was 14, he toured behind Jerry Lee Lewis. And in the '60s, he worked for Phil Spector, playing on \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and arranging Ike and Tina Turner's \"River Deep, Mountain High.\" Session work for Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones and many more would follow. \nBut in the twilight years of an impressive career, Russell has seized the spotlight he deserves; first with \"The Union,\" a critically-adored duets album with Elton John released in 2010, and then his own proper solo comeback album, \"Life Journey,\" four years later. \nLee Rocker — who, like another featured Potawatomi performer this week, Slim Jim Phantom, was in the Stray Cats — will open. \n— Piet Levy \n8 p.m. Wednesday, Pabst Theater. $45.50 to $75.50. \nAfter her rootsy, sparse 2012 album \"4th Street Feeling,\" soft rocker Melissa Etheridge opted for big and splashy with last year's genre-jumping \"This is M.E.\" But to these ears, the production often overwhelmed Etheridge's natural talents, most notably her raspy voice. \nNo chance of that happening on this tour, which features Etheridge performing solo. The approach, which will feature stories throughout the night, is a smart one, providing an intimacy and greater focus on the songwriting. \nAnd it also provides a special opportunity for fans to hear career-establishing '90s hits \"Come to My Window\" and \"I'm the Only One\" in their most basic and possibly best form. \n— Piet Levy \n7 p.m. Wednesday, the Rave. Free. \nChase Bryant owes his up-and-coming country music career to his granddaddy. Not only did Grandpa Jimmy hook Bryant on Jerry Lee Lewis records when he was a toddler, but Jimmy Bryant was also a session musician in Nashville who performed with Roy Orbison. \nNow it's Chase's turn. \nWriting his first song when he was 11 — which was only about 10 years ago — Bryant moved from his hometown of Orange Grove, Texas, to Nashville after high school, where Orbison's widow, Barbara, gave him his first break with a publishing deal. \nThen in 2013, he signed a deal with Red Bow Records — which allowed the newcomer to co-produce his own material — and Bryant's first single, \"Take It On Back,\" cracked the top 10 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart last year. \n— Piet Levy \nLOCAL SHOW SPOTLIGHT \nNO NO YEAH OKAY, 9 p.m. Thursday, Hotel Foster, 2028 E. North Ave. $7. The intriguing electronic act celebrates its debut EP \"Dual\" with special guests Kiings , A iro Kwil and I'm Not a Pilot . — Piet Levy © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
