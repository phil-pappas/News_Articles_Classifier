Source: Supplied\n“It’s interesting hearing all the suggestions,” she said of her friends opinions, “every time I’m on a single date with Dave, they’re like, ‘it’s definitely Dave’ and then I was on a single date with Sash and they’re like ‘it’s definitely Sash’. They’ve got no idea, they can’t pick it and I’m very tight-lipped, I don’t say anything.”\nWhile Frost says she is “very, very happy” with the final man, she has ceased meeting up with him since the show has aired.\n“Not anymore,” she said of their secret dates, “it’s just not worth catching up with him and spoiling the show.” Sasha Mielczarek and Sam Frost instantly hit it off. Source: Supplied\nFrost also dismissed rumours that she was unhappy with the selection of men chosen for her by producers, after a tabloid magazine said she stormed off in disappointment after meeting the 14 bachelors.\n“That is absolutely false”, she said. “I walked away because I was so emotional about how amazing the guys were, I couldn’t believe how genuine they were.”\nAnd has she heard from Dave, the “international model” who had a few choice words for her during last week’s confrontational rose ceremony?\n“No I havent but he’s actually a good guy, I just think he was a bit oblivious in what he was saying. I was a bit fierce.”\n Has Sam hinted Sasha isn’t her final man?", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227553/806759-c1bc6446-68a5-11e5-8a7a-1db252b8f9e4.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227553/805839-c687c3bc-68a5-11e5-8a7a-1db252b8f9e4.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/has-sam-hinted-sasha-isnt-her-final-man/story-fnet0gly-1227553805866"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:19:32.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
