[Spoilers & Release Date] Comment Subscribe to Newsletter! Will Hercule change hair color in the 15 th episode of \"Dragon Ball Super\"? In the teaser for the upcoming episode, which will air October 18, the character also otherwise known as Mr. Satan was seen turning into a Super Saiyan, golden, spiky hair and all. That moment was ultra short, though, and some viewers may have missed this as the whole clip was \"blink-and-you'll-miss-it short,\" according to Kotaku , which speculated that the said transformation could just be part of a dream sequence. Like Us on Facebook \"Even if Mr. Satan doesn't really turn into a Super Saiyan in the next episode, there's some good that comes of all of this: That golden moustache,\" it added. For fans of the series, this turn of event will be a must-watch, amusing episode, considering the caricaturish nature of Mr. Satan. \"The traditional blowhard, he constantly makes out that he is the strongest fighter ever and while he's tough for a human, he often finds out the hard way what it's like to go up against Saiyans,\" Forbes ' Ollie Barder noted. \"This is why seeing this Super Saiyan transformation teased for Mr. Satan is more than a bit weird.\" For those in the know, Super Saiyan-hood is the privilege of those with Saiyan ancestry able to boost their power level. Mr. Satan, however, is a mere human. The \"strongest man alive\" turning Super Saiyan is a baffling, albeit potentially comical, event. After all, for all his arrogance, he's still on the side of the good guys. \"It is, however, pretty impressive for a character that has no Saiyan blood whatsoever to become one,\" Tech Times observed. \"That's kind of the main reason everybody on the show isn't one. Being a Saiyan is a requirement...or it was one.\" Is it possible that our heroes are in dire straits and needed every help they can get, even from a human being whose skills are virtually \"close to worthless in fights against gods and monsters\"? However, Design&Trend noted that Goku and other saiyans are actually \"alive and well\" and thus isn't in a desperate situation. As such, it's likely that \"this battle will be more comical than dangerous.\" Further, episode 15 may probably also see Goku helping out Mr. Satan in his battle. Goku may even assist in a way that it won't be obvious to Mr. Satan that he'd had special help in defeating the enemy. Plus, it's probably that the enemy will be rather weaker than the usual Z fighter the heroes face.
