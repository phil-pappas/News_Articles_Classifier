The work is peppered with comments on contemporary society, though personal thoughts and memories are given almost equal prominence. Unveiled in London earlier this month, it has already taken on an urban legend quality. The piece 'London Town', is instantly recognisable, not by the obvious landmarks, but by the hedonistic, enchanting character of the metropolis that Fuller communicates.\n     (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276194 )\n\nThe artist lived, breathed and morphed into the capital city to channel its character onto the map. Delve into the cryptic drawings of London Town; the unstoppable skyscrapers, dingy underground clubs, its decadence, the infinite energy, creativity, the expansion, its systems and its future.  London Town is an emotional conversation that you can join, read, experience and create new. It is a result of Fuller's project, Fuller Maps, which has seen him drawing a series of intricate maps that narrate and observe the identity of places. He has previously completed a map of Bristol , which took 4 years to create. Fuller describes his practice as 'making a collection of cartographical love letters.' His past work has been included in the Bristol Museums Historical Map Archive.\n'London Town' can next be seen at the 'Flux Exhibition', Royal College of Art, London , December 11 th - 14 th For more information about Fuller's art please visit http://www.fullermaps.com \nFuller created a short film whilst cycling around London on his explorations, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey-Eh_uzRpY \nThe ten chimes from Big Ben featured in the film symbolise the ten year period in which it was drawn.\nOptional video content about 'London Town' can be embedded  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey-Eh_uzRpY \nBackground information\nFuller Maps is a series of works by British artist Fuller, aka Gareth Wood (b.1980). Fuller draws intricate maps that narrate and observe the identity of places. Using extensive research, local knowledge and lived experience, he immerses himself within a place to understand its complex personality. Taking on average five years to produce, Fuller meticulously creates pen drawings that exhibit pockets of narrative on contemporary society. They are entwined with stories, curiosities, factoids and personal memories. By mapping events Fuller provides a subjective account which is instantly relatable. In doing so, the artwork places prominence on shared knowledge and experience, a distinctive characteristic of Fuller's work.\n\nContact email: hello@fullermaps.com \n\nSOURCE British artist Fuller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:18:20.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
