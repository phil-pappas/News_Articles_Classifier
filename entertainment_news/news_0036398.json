What once was the Norton Air Force Base seemed to remain just another business that closed its doors to the public in 1992.\nHowever, the airport will re-open its gates to the public to host SBD Fest, an air show and benefit concert with Cassadee Pope and more, on Saturday, Oct. 17.\n“You go to a coffee shop in San Bernardino, in our backyard and you ask them what’s happening at the airport and most people have no idea,” said Mark Gibbs, Director of Aviation for the San Bernardino International Airport.\nGibbs and his team have been working tirelessly on the event since April keeping the same goals in mind, to re-connect the airport with the community and to promote aviation.\nGibbs explained in a phone interview that for the first two decades after the airport was transferred to the San Bernardino International Airport Authority the plan was to renovate and build out the airport. This included replacing the runway, revamping the taxiways, adding another hangar and building international and executive terminals to handle the traffic from new clients such as cargo companies and private service aircraft.\nNow, to market the airport, the authority is inviting the local community to this weekend’s festival.\nMore than 20 years have passed since the last air show took place at the airport, Gibbs said. He and his team worked with local organizations as well as the city of San Bernardino to put SBD Fest together. Organizers are expecting 10,000-12,000 attendees at the event, which will include a country concert starring Pope and Craig Campbell, a stunt motorcycle show, a car show, vendors, a beer garden and more in addition to the multiple aerial acts.\nPope, played the Stagecoach Country Music Festival earlier this year and was the winner of the third season of “The Voice.”\nCampbell, known for hits such as “Family Man” and “Keep Them Kisses Coming,” played keyboard for both Tracy Byrd and Luke Bryan before finding solo success.\nAmong the aerial acts are the Patriots Jet Team, which includes six jets that will perform a 26 minute aerobatic spectacular, Ace Maker Airshows’ Gregory Colyer, Rob Harrison and the Tumbling Bear, the Just in Time Skydivers and Julie Clarke. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Aviation Special Enforcement Division will also do a demonstration.\nMany of the aerial performers are veterans and will incorporate patriotism in their performances.\nThe proceeds from the event will be split between the airport and it partners, including Heroes’ Wings Foundation, which helps veterans with PTSD and other injuries travel to receive medical treatment.\nThe festival will also begin with an opening ceremony that pays tribute to the airport’s past life.\n“We want to recognize our heritage as a former air force base,” said Gibbs.\nContact the writer: features@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8lr3-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5nc.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8lr5-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5n5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8lr5-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5n5.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8lr4-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5nf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8lr4-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5n9.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8lr4-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5n9.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8lr4-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5nf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8lr3-b88540070z.120151014180448000g39cj5nc.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:30:14.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
