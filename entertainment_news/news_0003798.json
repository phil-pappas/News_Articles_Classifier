She has described it as her “dream job”. QI host Stephen Fry with Alan Davies, Lucy Porter, Ross Noble and Matt Lucas (BBC) \nSandi currently presents Channel 4 quiz show Fifteen To One. She stood down as chair of BBC Radio Four’s The News Quiz earlier this year after a 10-year run. \nResident panellist Alan Davies will remain on the show. \nEach series of QI is named after a successive letter of the alphabet. The upcoming “M” series will be Fry’s last. \nDescribed as the world’s most seemingly impossible quiz, the award-winning show launched on BBC Two in September 2003. \nWith Stephen at the helm, QI quickly became a favourite with viewers thanks to its unique blend of wit and obscure trivia, all embodied in its knowledgeable presenter. \nTwitter is mourning his loss, but also celebrating Sandi’s appointment. Stephen Fry stepping down from QI is like Santa stepping down from being Santa Promoted stories \n— Matt Richardson (@MattRichardson3) October 14, 2015 Can't believe Stephen Fry is leaving QI. I know he's a bit pompous when it suits him but he's very engaging TV and a bit of a hero of mine. \n— Simon Boyle (@SimonBoyle87) October 14, 2015 Stephen Fry is leaving QI BUT DON'T PANIC BECAUSE SANDI TOKSVIG IS AT HAND TO PATRONISE EVERYONE INSTEAD. What. A. Relief. \n— Silly Old Daniel (@sillyolddaniel) October 14, 2015 \nTalking about his time on the show, Stephen said: “For 13 years I had one of the best jobs on television. Behind the camera squadrons of quite extraordinarily brilliant researchers, programme makers and uniquely curious (in both senses of the word) people making that job so much easier. \n“In front of the camera generations of lively minds and above all of course the wonder of nature that is Alan Davies. After passing the alphabetical halfway mark I thought it time to move on, but I will never cease to be grateful to John Lloyd for devising QI and for everyone else for making it such fun.” Sandi Toksvig (Ian West/PA) \nSandi said: “QI is my favourite television programme both to watch and to be on, so this is absolutely my dream job. (My Nordic background also makes me keen to spend time with the Elves). \n“Stephen has been utterly brilliant with the first half of the alphabet. Now I look forward to picking up the baton, mixing my metaphors and sailing towards the Land of Nod (i.e. Z). Who knows what lies ahead? It should all be quite interesting.” \nQI creator and producer John Lloyd added: “Stephen’s departure is the end of an era. It’s been a thoroughly delightful experience. After more than 40 years in broadcasting, QI has been by far the most enjoyable show it has been my privilege to produce, and Stephen has been its big, beating heart.
