With the barrage of trick-or-treating, caramel apples and costumes less than a month away, here are five animated Halloween films for families to consider: \nIn theaters: 'Hotel Transylvania 2' \nDracula returns to the big screen in “Hotel Transylvania 2,” and this time he’s trying to bring out the vampire in his half-human grandson. The Dove Foundation calls the film “a visual feast for the eyes” and states that it is “even funnier than the first one.” The website also points out that the film has a good moral, stating, “Dracula comes to realize that he will love his grandson no matter if he is a vampire, a human or even a unicorn! ...
