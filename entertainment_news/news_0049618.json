It will likely kick off a large run of shows at the venue that is scheduled to open just a few days before Strait's first concert, and fans can find an abundance of affordable George Strait ticket options during the public sale going on now at TicketProcess.com.\n(PRWEB) October 02, 2015\nGeorge Strait recently announced a slew of concert dates at the new Las Vegas arena in April of 2016. Others such as Wayne Newton and Celine Dion have done the exact same thing in recent decades. The fact that George Strait will be christening a brand new building will forever link him and the structure together in history.\nThe fun will begin this beginning in late April with opening shows on Friday the 22nd and Saturday the 23rd. Friday and Saturday night shows are also scheduled for early September and December. Additional dates are expected to be added.\nWhat exactly The Cowboy has in store for fans in Las Vegas is still under lock and key. He wowed a huge audience well into six figures at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas last summer during the conclusion of his Cowboy Walks Away Tour.\nThe performance left fans with a sense of finality toward the illustrious career of the great performer, and the spark has once again been lit for a run of high-energy shows. Strait fans can now find tickets online beginning today for the George Strait concert tour in Las Vegas.\n*TicketProcess.com is not associated or otherwise connected in any form with the college or professional organizations, teams, artists, bands or other performers featured on this site.
