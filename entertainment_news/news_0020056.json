The comfy, Midwestern living room vibe also imbues the lengthy cocktail list — the Bring Out Your Dead featuring Death's Door Gin; the Girl Scout on Valentine's Day, sporting green Chartreuse — with a more playful than pretentious character, as if an eccentric uncle started whipping up cocktails in his den with astounding finesse.\nIn that vein, Watershed's You Never Know ($11) is as beguiling as the name. The drink offers a cozy embrace of autumn apple in its foundation of Leopold Bros. Apple Whiskey, and further intrigues with a buzz of Averna, a pucker of lemon and a tumble of Angostura and peach bitters served in a generous glass. Also true to title is the drink's curious staying power, as elements sweet, bitter, fruity and herbal combine in such a way that even with the accompaniment of a late-night bar snack (hey there, cheese curds and truffle fries), the imprint of this eclectic libation lingers.\n601 N.
