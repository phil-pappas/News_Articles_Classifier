The TV host and actor is added to the cast to play Vince Fontaine, the charismatic host of televised dance competition \"Bandstand National Dance-Off\", which isn't far from Lopez's real-life profession. The former host of \" The X Factor (US) \" joins the cast which already has Aaron Tveit on board as Danny, Julianne Hough as Sandy, Carlos Pena Jr. as Kenickie, David Del Rio as T-Bird \"Putzie\", Keke Palmer as Marty, Vanessa Hudgens as Rizzo, Carly Rae Jepsen as Frenchy, and Kether Donohue as Jan. Jessie J is also tapped to open the show with a performance of Barry Gibb's \"Grease (Is the Word)\" from the 1978 film. In this TV version, the beginning of senior year means the end of Danny and Sandy's summer romance - until Sandy unexpectedly transfers to Danny's high school. With their friends pulling them in different directions, it's up to Danny and Sandy to stay hopelessly devoted as they make their way from Rydell High to a new frontier. Marc Platt executive produces the show, Thomas Kail serves as the director overseeing the stage direction and Alex Rudzinski serves as the live television director. Zach Woodlee (\" Glee \") is in charge of choreography. \"Grease Live\" is slated to air Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 7/6c on FOX. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:43:52.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
