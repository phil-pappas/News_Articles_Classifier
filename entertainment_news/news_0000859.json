It's the reason why, several times a year, dictionaries trumpet the addition of new and typically very trendy words. \nBut more interesting than the new words, I think, are the old words that have gotten new meanings: words such as \"cloud\" and \"tablet\" and \"catfish,\" with very long pre-Internet histories. The reappropriation is rarely random; in most cases, the original meaning of the word is a metaphor for the new one.

To that list, we have added a few tech terms of our own: such as \"troll\" and \"firehose.\" \nOn one hand, the list shows how technology has shaped language over time. But it also shows how language has shaped technology â€” or, at least, our technological understandings and paradigms. Think about a term such as \"cloud\": the fact that we picked that to describe cloud computing says a whole lot about how we viewed that technology when it was brand-new. Don't even get me started on words such as \"sandbox\" and \"canoe\"...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:57.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
