Having to also give up a beloved pet that you can no longer afford can be the very last straw to emotional despair. Yet all over this country, loving pet parents can be found sobbing in shelter lobbies as they surrender dogs they can no longer care for financially.\nMaybe it's a veterinary diagnosis that will require thousands of dollars in treatment or surgery or a condition that requires medication or special food at a time when the dog's parents just don't have the funds. A high percentage of these dogs end up in shelters and most of those will be euthanized.\nThese are the issues that were on the mind of Mario Manning in 2009 after her beloved shelter dog, Ladybug, passed away. She had adopted the dog when it was 10 years old and loved and cared for her for 4 years until Ladybug's death. The dog had many medical conditions that required extensive finances along the way but she lived a happy, loved life with Mario. Mario was grateful to have had the resources to fund Ladybug's care. In Ladybug's honor, Mario wished to \"pay it forward\" by donating to another needy dog's care so that it could remain with it's parent but she couldn't find any organizations to help her find someone with that need.\nJust two months after Ladybug's death, Mario founded Fairy Dogparents with the mission of preventing dogs in Massachusetts from being surrendered to shelters due to economic hardship of their owners. The non-profit is driven by Mario and just a few other volunteers who raise money through donations and sift through applicants to disperse as much as $800 to those who qualify for their help and as long as there are funds in the Fairy Dogparents coffers.\n**Over 900 dogs have had over $503,000 in aid provided by Fairy Godparents since its inception!**\nAs you can imagine, applications for help outnumber donations coming in. In order to help more people keep their dogs, Fairy Dogparents asks for donations and then funds food, medical care and general wellness needs for Massachusetts dog parents. Donors can sponsor a dog or donate any amount towards one's care. Many loving, generous dog owners donate in honor of their own dogs, living or passed, to \"pay it forward\".\nPlease, if you can, * make any size donation by clicking here * to learn more about the ways to help this organization help others. It's hard to imagine the anguish of having to surrender a dog you love because you can't afford to care for him.
