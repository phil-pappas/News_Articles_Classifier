Sam Holden Local band the Sword. \nLots of things are different these days for the Sword, arguably Austin’s most prominent metal band of the past decade. Singer and guitarst John Cronise now lives in North Carolina, and the band has shifted a bit from the heaviness of its primal output.

Told through recordings in Anne’s cherished diary, the play stands as a timeless reflection of her fear, hope and faith during one of the darkest periods in history. — Ari Auber \nArts Artist Tom Friedman’s 33-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture “Looking Up” is now on permanent display at Laguna Gloria. \nTom Friedman’s “Looking Up” at Contemporary Austin, Laguna Gloria \nGrounds hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.
