A knife-wielding Illinois teen stormed a children's chess class, reportedly screaming \"I'm going to kill some people!\" before being overtaken by a 75-year-old Army veteran with a lethal set of hands.\nDustin Brown, 19, unleashed his war cry to a room full of 16 children and mothers, causing them to scurry beneath tables at the Morton Public Library on Tuesday, the Pekin Times reported.\nJames Vernon, a retired chess club teacher who received knife-fighting training 50 years ago in the Army, said he was teaching the homeschoolers, ages 7 to 13, when he calmly confronted the madman first with conversation.\n\"I tried to talk to him. I tried to settle him down,\" he said. \"I didn't, but I did deflect his attention\" from the children,\" he told the paper.\nThat move allowed the kids, and a few of their mothers, to escape through the room's only door, he said.\nWEEK-TV Vernon suffered two cut arteries and a sliced tendon in his left hand while disarming the crazed teen. WEEK-TV The Morton Public Library, where Vernon was helping teach chess, recognized him as their '#1 hero' after he thwarted a potential mass casualty attack. Previous Next Enlarge With the room cleared, Vernon and Brown faced one another as the demented teen — reportedly out on bond while facing child porn charges — was described as making small cuts into his left arm with one of two 5-inch blades.\n\"He was trying to scare me, and he did,\" he said.\nBut if Brown was going to attack, Vernon said he now knew which hand it'd be coming from: his right.\n\"First rule of combat: Be fast and vigorous,\" he said while recalling what happened next.\nPolice Handout Dustin Brown, 19, was out on bond while facing child porn charges when he allegedly tried to stab children inside of a library. Brown lunged for him, slashing from the right towards Vernon who blocked the blade with his left hand.\nThe veteran, who never served in combat, then grabbed the teen and threw him, somehow getting him on a table. While holding him down, Vernon said he then began punching the teen's collarbone, consequently numbing Brown’s arm until he dropped his knife.\nA responding library employee then removed the knives and helped Vernon pin Brown down until first responders arrived.\nWhen it was over, Vernon was severely injured, suffering two cut arteries and a sliced tendon in his left hand.\nSpeaking to the Pekin Times from his Morton home Thursday, he joked that he may have won his \"90 seconds of combat ... but I felt like I lost the war.\"\nAccording to those he saved, however, it was nothing but a heroic victory.\n\"Here at the library, we love our fictional heroes such as Sherlock Holmes, Nancy Drew and Robin Hood. But this week, the #1 hero in our book is Jim Vernon,\" the library posted on their Facebook page Thursday.\nBrown was ordered held on $800,000 bond while facing charges of attempted murder, armed violence, aggravated battery to a person over age 60 and burglary for entering the library with intent to commit a crime.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
