Festival goers will be savoring their selections by pairing them with food from some of the Midstate's finest restaurants, including Kayne Prime, Sperry’s, 1808 Grille, Moto and Sopapilla’s. \n“We were so excited to see an absolutely amazing selection of wines this year,” Penny Floyd, the event's chair, said in a media statement. “Placing 400 wines inside The Factory at Franklin really challenged the event staff, but the wines being offered were all so outstanding. We simply had to present them all to the public.” \nAlthough the event will be shrouded in fun, funds raised will go toward the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Middle Tennessee, a volunteer organization that pairs children with an adult mentor. \nAll wines featured at the festival will be on sale a week after the event at Cool Springs Wines & Spirits. \nTickets are $89 at franklinwinefestival.com . If tickets don't sell out before the event, they will be $100 at the door.
