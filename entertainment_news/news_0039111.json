This frank book provides an optimistic perspective on the pleasures of “old age.”\nIn the insightful \"Four Passions: Conversations with Myself,\" Wallace Peters describes the psychological pitfalls that many couples encounter after being obliged to retire from the working world.\nNow in his 90s, the author is a widely renowned medical scientist who retired in his 60s. His career centered on tropical diseases and ways to combat them in the field, the laboratory, and in academia. He writes of the nomadic life he led with his Swiss wife, Ruth, a linguist and embroidery artist, and the psychological trauma that they experienced after his retirement. In 2007, the couple moved into a peaceful retirement village in the English countryside, where nine months later, Ruth died of cancer.\nThe author observed that many of his 200 fellow residents in his retirement home were struggling to find direction in their lives. Hoping to provide guidance, he set out in this book to describe his and his late wife’s positive lifestyle in their own post-retirement existence, proving that there is still enjoyment after retirement.\nWatch the video at: http://youtu.be/1fCk5fA9QM0\nAbout the Author: Wallace Peters, a Londoner and the recipient of the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine in 1983, currently resides in Castle Retirement Village near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.
