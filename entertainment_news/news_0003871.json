He and his sisters were inspired to help create the center in 2008 by their mother, who died from cancer last year. \nLast year, 3,871 participants in the Dempsey Challenge raised $1.14 million. \nDempsey left \"Grey's Anatomy\" earlier this year. In addition to racing, he's filming the movie \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" in London. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
