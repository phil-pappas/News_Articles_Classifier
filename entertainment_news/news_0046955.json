The visual design firm completed a 14,000-square foot mural on corrugated hangar doors at the Boeing Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center located on Cape Canaveral, Florida .\nNASA and Boeing officials unveiled the impressive facility during a grand opening ceremony held Sept. 4 . Many dignitaries were in attendance, inclusive of Florida Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson . Boeing will use the remodeled building to start manufacturing the CST-100 Starliner , the capsule that will soon transport astronauts to the International Space Station.\nThe team at superGraphics had its work cut out for it, being tasked to prepare, test, manufacture and install an outside mural that would evoke the excitement of space travel and the work being completed just inside the doors.\n\"superGraphics was honored to be part of this history-making program,\" said Cindy Victor , senior business development director for the visual communication company.\nThe graphics depicted the Starliner pod orbiting in space over the tip of Florida with the blue Atlantic Ocean in the background. The superGraphics team was able to complete the project from beginning to end in just three weeks. However, once the installation was underway, severe weather warnings started to hit the state. Moisture, wind, rain and heat can hinder the ability to gain proper adhesion. superGraphics took necessary precautions to ensure a successful outcome, but was fortunate that Hurricane Erica changed direction.\n\"The Grand Opening Event was highly successful. The mural and event activities evoked much excitement and emotion from the crowds and dignitaries,\" says Cindy Victor .\nThe Boeing Company posted a time-lapse video of the graphics installation.\n\"Boeing is on the cusp of a new era of commercial space,\" Victor said. \"superGraphics is proud to have been a part of the past 100 years and excited to look forward to the next 100 years.\"\nAbout superGraphics\nA specialist in visual communication, superGraphics works with companies around the world to turn their design ideas into reality.
