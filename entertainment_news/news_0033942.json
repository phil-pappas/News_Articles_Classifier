With a joint investment of more than $10 million by its partner, Sichuan PG Salient Cultural Trade Co., the festival will set a precedent in terms of scale and design of all lantern festivals ever hosted in the U.S.\n\"Magical Winter Lights aims to create a brand new holiday light show experience to Houstonians of all ages,\" said Yusi C. An, founder and president of People Generation. \"We are excited to partner with a top-notch lantern company from China to start a new holiday tradition for Houston families for many years to come, and in more cities throughout the U.S. in the future.\"\nMagical Winter Lights differentiates itself from other more traditional holiday lighting events by basing its designs on Chinese lanterns and transforming them into larger-than-life remakes of well-known landmarks and landscapes in the world. The festival will feature seven fascinating themed sections including Magical, Europe, America, Asia, Oceania, Africa and the Animal Kingdom. The America section will display lantern sets that Houstonians and Texans can easily relate to, including their hometown sports teams, Western stockyards and the Houston skyline.\nMagical Winter Lights also is one of the first lantern festivals to experiment with interactive lantern sets. Festival goers will get to enjoy live performances as part of the lantern display or walk inside of the delicate lantern sets that bring out an experience beyond a visual feast.\nCarnival rides and games, international and local food vendors, cultural performances and exhibitors featuring Chinese intangible cultural heritage crafts also will be offered at the 2015 Magical Winter Lights.
