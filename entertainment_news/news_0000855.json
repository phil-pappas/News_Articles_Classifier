Julia's annual November Lamps, Glass, and Fine Jewelry auction! This remarkable sale features over 650 lots with over $2 million in inventory from many fresh to the market private collections from all across the United States.\nJulia's is thrilled to present the spectacular Dr. Robert LeVere glass collection, on offer without reserve. Collectors will truly appreciate this 60-piece grouping, all in immaculate condition. LeVere, from central Ohio, purchased these fantastic examples in the 1960s and 1970s during trips to New York City associated with professional conferences. This collection features a breathtaking selection of top of the line 1920s era Argy Rousseau pate de verre in extremely choice patterns. Highlights include a marvelous Spiders & Brambles vase, a Feather vase, and a Chrysanthemum vase; each is estimated between $1,500 and $3,000. These patterns all reflect the nature, floral, and animal themes that were so popular at the time.\nThe LeVere collection also features remarkable French cameo glass examples from a number of prestigious and well-known manufacturers. Highlights include a Galle mold blown red and yellow crocus vase (estimated at $2,000-3,000), a Daum Nancy winter scene vase (estimated at $1,500-3,000), and a Burgun & Schverer Bleeding Heart gilded cameo vase, estimated at $1,500-3,000. And collectors will certainly cast a hungry eye to a number of Victorian era and Early American examples including Stevens & Williams and Sandwich items, including a pair of green tulip vases (estimated at $1,000-1,500), and an English carved vase with applied handles attributed to Stevens & Williams, estimated at $600-900.\nThis auction offers nine outstanding Tiffany Studios and fine lamp examples from the collection of Jean Paul Loup. Loup, a successful dealer and collector of fine art and glass from the Chicago area, came to America from France on holiday when he was just 22 years old in 1965 with the intention of staying for 2 months. He fell in love with the country and never left, becoming a US Citizen on July 4th, 1976. After building a reputation and financial success in the international fine art world, Mr. Loup has become a collector of fine and contemporary art, American and French art glass, and Tiffany lighting. A discriminating collector, Mr. Loup purchased each of these quality lamps at either James D. Julia, Inc. or Sotheby’s New York. Collectors will unquestionably take a shine to the nine conservatively priced lamps, highlighted by a Nasturtium table lamp on a rare American Indian style base and an Allover Dogwood lamp (each estimated at $40,000-50,000), as well as an Arrowroot table lamp and a Daffodil lamp, each estimated at $35,000-45,000.\nArt glass spanning several genres is a major category of offerings in this upcoming sale. Dr. Mark Jackson, from the St. Louis, MO area, began collecting art glass as a child when he accompanied his parents on buying trips and to antique shows. This auction features almost 50 of the finest selections from this diverse collection.\nThe Jackson collection features five magnificent Galle marquetry vases. A highlight from this grouping - and perhaps the entire auction as a whole - is a 14-1/2” iris and flames Galle marquetry vase in its original presentation box, which is estimated at $15,000-25,000. Our cataloger described it as \"The highest quality Galle marquetry piece we have ever had the privilege of offering.\" Collectors will also be all aflutter over a 13-3/4” Galle marquetry butterfly vase from this collection, which is estimated at $10,000-20,000.\nJackson also had a fine eye for antique Loetz, KPM plaques, and Handel lighting, and this sale offers some of the finest examples of these categories in recent memory. Included is a brilliantly colored rare Loetz PG 691 vase (conservatively estimated at $3,000-5,000) and a Loetz chalice shaped vase in the highly sought after PG 358 genre, commonly referred to as a “black bottom,\" estimated at $3,000-5,000. A large KPM plaque of an old woman is estimated at $6,000-8,000; its quality and details rivals the best oil paintings of its period. A very rare and desirable reverse painted Handel 7040 Tulip lamp, estimated at $4,000-6,000, will most certainly electrify the bidding audience.\nThe Jackson collection also offers many fine selections for those who prefer more modern glass objets d'art. These are all competitively priced to sell - and delight buyers! Contemporary highlights include a Harvey Littleton glass sculpture (estimated at $2,000-3,000) and a large Mark Peiser vase with orange and yellow decoration, estimated at $2,000-4,000. Several of the fine contemporary examples in the Jackson collection are featured in Grover's Contemporary Art Glass reference book.\nJulia's is also offering over two dozen fantastic selections from the Dean and Kate Armstrong collection, to be sold UNRESERVED as part of this premier sales event. The Armstrong family, from Kansas, concentrated on Tiffany and fine pottery. Tiffany highlights from this particularly well-curated grouping include a gold 12-panel linenfold table lamp (estimated at $8,000-12,000), a 10 damascene intaglio carved dragonfly table lamp (estimated at $6,000-8,000), and a spectacular Cypriote vase, conservatively estimated at $3,000-5,000. And collectors can't help but get creative over a grouping of Arts and Crafts era pottery standouts, including a framed Rookwood nature scene plaque by Rothendush (estimated at $2,000-3,000), a Newcomb College vase by Anna F. Simpson (estimated at $2,000-4,000), and a Wheatley pottery lamp base supporting a Tiffany spider arm, estimated at $2,500-4,500.\nA private UNRESERVED collection from a Long Island, NY Estate will really get glass enthusiasts aglow! The collection includes a broad scope of Tiffany favrile art glass and metal items, Loetz selections, and decorated art glass shades from Quezal and other makers. Two highlights - among many others - include a handsome and distinctive Tiffany Cypriote/Lava vase, (estimated at $800-1,200), and a most unusual Tiffany Favrile Glass salesman's sample kit. This set, from the Tiffany Furnaces in Corona, Long Island, New York, features five sample containers each housing a series of colorful cabochons, finials, and other glass items used in the manufacture of custom stained glass windows and decorative items. This remarkable offering is conservatively estimated at $800-1,200.\nAnother private collection on offer at Julia's - this one from the Boston, MA area - features a collection of Le Verre Francais cameo glass with some of the more sought-after and desirable patterns. These stunning pieces, decorated in a hybrid style of the Art Nouveau and Art Deco periods, feature stylized plant, animal, and nature themes. Collectors will light up over a gorgeous and rare mottled purple Bonsai table lamp, one of the more sought-after patterns, (estimated at $7,000-9,000) and a beautifully crafted floor lamp with metalwork by artist Paul Kiss with a Muller shade, estimated at $7,000-9,000.\nThis auction is a can't miss opportunity for Tiffany enthusiasts. In addition to the items from private collections highlighted above, this sale offers many other truly outstanding Tiffany lighting and art glass examples. Most collectors will feel a little evening romance over an exceptionally rare and lovely ‘October Night’ chandelier (estimated at $160,000-180,000), a rare mottled and opalescent Koi Fish lamp, with provenance to a 1991 international auction (estimated at $50,000-100,000), a Poppy lamp with amber and lavender glass that truly comes to life when illuminated (estimated at $70,000-90,000), and a newly discovered Apple Blossom \"dash numbered\" shade, found in an Ohio home, which is estimated at $20,000-30,000. Our research shows that this remarkable example, numbered 1512-1, has never appeared at auction before.\nFor Tiffany art glass enthusiasts, all eyes will be on a rare aquamarine floral glass vase (estimated at $40,000-60,000), and a spectacular 9” red favrile vase with an iridescent decoration, estimated at $20,000-25,000. This absolute rarity was on display at the Dayton Art Institute from 2003-2004 and is a stunning example of Tiffany’s most desirable red favrile glass.\nAs always, Julia’s will present a fantastic assortment of cameo glass from various noteworthy makers. Jewels in this grouping include an elaborately decorated blue and white 10-1/2” Webb cameo handled vase with exquisite detailing (estimated at $47,500-52,500), an 11-1/2” Galle mold blown berry vase (estimated $6,000-8,000), a 12-1/4” Burgun & Schverer wheel-carved floral cameo vase (estimated at $10,000-14,000), and a 12-1/2” complex Reyen cameo vase with a poppy and thistle decoration, estimated at $18,500-22,500.\nCollectors interested in the highest quality and most attractive antique lighting will be delighted with the full range of lamps available through this sale.

Porcelli Studios fans will catch the bouquet with a stunning floral lamp with an irregular border, which is being offered as part of the Jean Paul Loup collection. This extraordinary example is estimated at $8,000-10,000.\nVictorian and early American glass has been a long time specialty at Julia's, and this sale offers many fine selections in these popular categories.

Washington examples on offer, including a pitcher decorated with fish in a net (estimated at $900-1,200), complete with its Brookside Antiques sticker from noted dealer/collector Louis St. Aubin, a black Lava vase (estimated at $1,200-1,800), and a Royal Flemish handled vase, estimated at $2,000-3,000.
