By Luke Reilly \nRockstar has confirmed the contents of the next update for GTA Online , which will focus on lowrider culture. GTA Online: Lowriders will be made available as an automatic update on PC, PS4, and Xbox One next Tuesday, October 20. \nThe update will introduce a new customs workshop located in downtown Strawberry: Benny’s Original Motor Works. Rockstar explains players will be able to visit the Benny’s website via their in-game phone and select from six specific, customisable vehicles they can apply new lowrider mods to. We’ll be able to dress engine blocks with fancy covers and air filters, reupholster interiors with velour and leather, install bespoke dials, steering wheels, subwoofers, and shift levers, and lift cars with hydraulics. \nWhen meeting up with friends Rockstar also confirmed we’ll be able to use the Player Interaction Menu (while inside or outside the car) to open up the vehicle doors, hood, and trunk. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:25:28.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
