The recently launched HITS platform offers over 500 channels to the fast-growing television market in India .\nBy implementing the latest version of Actus's broadcast monitoring platform, NXT is being guaranteed that all IP-based channels are reliably recorded 24x7 and that whenever more channels are added; Actus's scalable broadcast recording platform will be easily expanded. In order to comply with the current requirements, Actus has deployed Actus View® to record and monitor the 350 IP-based channels, Actus Multitrak® to support multiple audio tracks, Actus EncoderPro® to save hardware resources, Actus Loudness® to monitor audio levels, and Actus AlertCenter® to provide NXT with real-time alerts for any audio or video issues.\nTony D'Silva , Managing Director of Grant Investrade Limited said, \"In the dynamic digital video world, we are assured that Actus Digital will not only fulfill our current requirements but also comply with future requirements that the digital world will dictate. Actus has vast experience with installations worldwide and we are confident that the platform will grow as our business expands constantly.\"\nActus was selected for this premier service after a rigorous 4-stage RFP evaluation process conducted by Castle Media - Asia's leading broadcast consultancy tasked with end-to-end programme management and delivery of the HITS project. \"The Actus platform is scalable and modular, which makes the solution cost-effective by allowing GIL to implement only the modules required yet be assured that once additional requirements arise, Actus's platform will provide us the solution,\" said Vynsley Fernandes, Executive Director of Castle Media Private Limited.\nShaf Broadcast, Systems Integrator, implemented the solution. \"We have the knowledge base and experience to deploy Actus Digital's solutions,\" said P.R. Suresh , Director, Shaf Broadcast . \"The installation, implementation and integration of the Actus platform went fluently and complied with all of our high expectations. The Actus local team worked closely with Shaf engineers to make sure the system will be up and running and meet the high demands and tight time frames. I am assured Actus will provide an excellent platform to NXT DIGITAL also in the future.\"\n\"One of the challenges, beyond the installation of a large system, was the fastest-possible deployment that was required to meet the time frames of launching the digital rollout of NXT DIGITAL services,\" said Sima Levy , Actus CEO. \"In order to be sure that Actus would meet the tight time frames, we sent an Actus-trained local team to the customer's site to prepare the site ahead of time. With good cooperation with Shaf, we optimized our recorders to take advantage of recent improvements in hardware and of a new version of Actus's EncoderPro® technology and were thus able to offer better performance than initially proposed for the same budget.\"\nAbout Actus Digital\nActus Digital delivers an industry-leading intelligent broadcast monitoring platform for video recording, tagging, monitoring, analysis and content repurposing for OTT, catch-up TV, VOD or mobile platforms.
