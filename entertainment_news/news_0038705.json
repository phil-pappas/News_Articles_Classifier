Thousands of people will take the bhog (lunch prasad ) for four consecutive days at the Lokhandwala Gardens. Considered one of the most lavish Durga puja celebrations, this seven-day event has been conceptualised by singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya who first came up with the idea of this traditional community puja in 1996. In a candid chat, he tells us more...\nWhat prompted you to celebrate Durga puja in such a grand way?\nI landed in Mumbai after college, and as I struggled to establish a career, I missed Durga puja back home. It took me 15 years to attain fame. After that there was no looking back. It was like a junoon for me. I wanted to enjoy all those Durga pujas that I had missed out on during my youth. That is how it began. Even now, I strive to make it the best and the biggest celebration in India. I leave everything and dedicate myself to it. I didn't expect that it would turn into such a grand event. Our benchmark has been set and we are our own competition.\nREAD: ​Abhijeet Bhattacharya: Ghulam Ali a 'dengue artist' from 'terrorist country'\nWhat is special this year?\nThis year, a renowned jeweller from Kolkata is creating a special gold mukut (crown) for Maa Durga. For the first time, this year people will see our live kitchen and the tremendous amount of hard work that goes into making bhog prasad for thousands of people every day. They will notice how managing directors, chairmen, pilots and people in high posts come together for this festival and are selflessly involved in chopping vegetables and cooking in the kitchen. The Gariahat (traditional festive market) that we have created will have stalls for traditional saris, jhalmuri , bhander-chaa (tea in earthen cups) and more. This year, we are also introducing an art gallery with a massive exhibition of Durga paintings. Also, there will be live painting by artists on the stage while celebrity singers perform.\nLISTEN to Abhijeet Bhattacharya songs on Gaana.com\nMost Durga Puja celebrations are for four-five days but the TOI Lokhandwala Durgotsav is longer. Comment.\nYes, we begin a day in advance and we don't have visarjan on Dashami like the rest. In fact, it is one of the biggest days for us and the most crowded as all other pandals are empty and people throng here. There is bhoj (a lavish spread) and evening entertainment.\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook TOIEntertain\nWATCH: ​Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya apologizes for insensitive tweet - TOI", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/LS_HrEsXmW0", "http://gaana.com/search/artists/abhijeet%20bhattacharya", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:33:58.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
