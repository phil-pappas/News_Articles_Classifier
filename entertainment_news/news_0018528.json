In the Thursday, October 8 episode of \" The View \", the panelists were shown a video of kids rattling off \"ghetto black names,\" including \"Fo'Landra\" and \"Elephantisha.\" \"Just to bring it back, can we take back 'racist' and say 'discriminatory,' because I think that's a better word,\" Raven responded to the video, \"And I am very discriminatory against words like the ones that they were saying in the video. I'm not about to hire you if your name is Watermelondrea. It's just not going to happen. I'm not going to hire you.\" Raven looked defiant when fellow panelists pointed out that a child's name is probably determined before he or she is able to have a say. She then said, \"Is that mean?\" Some viewers slammed Raven on Twitter for her \"racist\" comment. The former \"The Cosby Show\" star hasn't responded to the backlash yet. Raven is on TV looking like Toucan Sam w/ her technicolor dreamcoat hair but wants to talk about not hiring folks w/ ghetto names.
