The country singer premiered on Monday, October 19 \"Break on Me\" which is a beautiful ballad about him offering his loved one a shoulder to cry on. \"Break on me/ Shatter like glass, come apart in my hands/ Take as long as it takes, girl,\" he tells the heartbroken lady on the guitar-driven track. \"Break on me/ Put your head on my chest, let me help you forget/ When your heart needs to break, just break on me.\" The song was written by Ross Copperman and Jon Nite, with Nathan Chapman co-producing. There have been speculation that the record was inspired by a real event when Urban had to comfort his wife Nicole Kidman after her father died last year. The \" American Idol \" judge's new album has also spawned \"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\" which came out a few weeks ago. No exact release date for the follow-up to 2013's \" Fuse \" has been set, but the project is scheduled to hit the stores later this year via Capitol Nashville. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:19.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
