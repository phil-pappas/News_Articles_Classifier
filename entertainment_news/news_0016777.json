The deal extends the long standing partnership between the two companies, which was last renewed in 2013. Star Wars: The Force Awakens will come to Sky in 2016. \nSky customers will be able to watch films such as Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur and Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the first pay TV window from around nine months after they are release in cinemas. This means fans could be able to enjoy the latest Star Wars film from the comfort of their homes as early as August 2016. \nMore: Disney Releases New Outtakes Of Robin Williams As The Genie In ‘Aladdin' \nThe agreement also means Sky customers will now get more Disney channels and series through catch-up TV and on demand offers. Included in the new agreement are ABC Studios primetime shows such as 'Scandal', 'Grey’s Anatomy' and 'Scrubs', which will become available on demand through the Sky Box Sets service. \nSpeaking about the deal , Gary Davey, managing director, content at Sky said: \"Sky and Disney have been working together for almost 25 years. This new agreement means our customers can continue to enjoy the biggest blockbusters like Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Inside Ou t before they are available on any other online subscription service.” \nMark Endemano, the senior vp/general manager, media distribution, Disney EMEA, added, “Two years on from its launch, we are particularly proud of the shared success of Sky Movies Disney, and look forward to bringing more of our much-loved stories and characters to audiences in the U.K. & Ireland.” \nFinancial terms of the deal have not yet been announced, but it looks like another blow for Netflix in the UK market, who had been trying to take at least one big studio away from rival Sky.
