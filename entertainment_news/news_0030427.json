There’s no way this is going to work,” she says. “But then I saw they were up to 40 food vendors and I thought if there are 40, I can’t be the worst one there. I figured I’d give it a shot.” \nEven though Tona may be a little nervous, one of the festival organizers, David Feldman Jr., chief operating officer of Delaware County, Pa.-based Elite Events Management Group, says Tona should have no fear.

It’s a cheesesteak with grilled onions and creamy macaroni and cheese mixed in. \n“I think she’s going to kill it. I think it’s going to be a major attraction,” Feldman says, adding that the fest will not only have traditional cheesesteaks, but also cheesesteak dumplings, cheesesteak egg rolls, cheesesteak tacos and more. \nThe final number of vendors has reached 60 for the festival , which just sold out its 25,000 tickets, Feldman says. He says it will be back as an annual event. \nIn addition to the sandwiches, there will be a cheesesteak eating competition, \"the world's largest cheesesteak,\" a zip line, a mechanical bull, cornhole and carnival games.
