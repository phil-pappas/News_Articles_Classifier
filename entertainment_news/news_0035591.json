The latest one to join is noted journo Era Saravanan with Kathukutti. It has a big message, but at the same time he has projected it subtly and not preachy. Though the movie has its own share of clichés, but for most part it is entertaining.\nArivazhagan (Narain) is an educated youth who has taken agriculture as his choice of profession. He belongs to a village in Tanjavur and is dead against the farmlands turning into concrete jungles and also used for the extraction of methane gas. He does nothing except spending all his time boozing in the company of his friend Ginger (Soori). Arivu’s father Santhanam (Jayaraj) is a sincere and hardworking politician for many years whose only dream is to contest in elections. In a dramatic turn of events the party head decides to give chances to youth in the forthcoming assembly elections. Instead of Santhanam, they select Arivu to contest in the elections. How Arivu changes his behavior and earns the goodwill of his people and also fulfills his father’s wishes and saves the farmers forms the rest.\nNarain has made a comeback after a gap and tried his hands in a rural comedy and the actor shines in a well-written role. Looks like comedian Soori is back in form and his performance enhances the entertainment quotient. Then there’s this Srushti Dange for the romantic angle and she does a decent job. Bharathiraja’s brother Jayaraj who acts as Narain's dad looks promising.\nDespite Saravanan choosing a theme that conveys a strong message including how agriculture is the backbone of the country etc, he does not go overboard and cleverly uses the comic elements to take forward the narrative. The movie is watchable once!\n entertainment Kollywood Katthukutty movie review Also Read Actress Shraddha Kapoor's hot pants photoshopped by Pak newspaper Manjhi's love for his wife inspired Ketan Mehta's 'Manjhi- The Mountain Man' Vinay’s next set to release Woman cop in uniform dancing with SRK draws criticism", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/kathukutty-movie-stills-3_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/entertainment-movie-review/article/movie-review-katthukutty-big-message-projected-subtly", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kathukutty-movie-stills-3_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:17:12.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
