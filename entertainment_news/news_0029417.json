Show Caption Next \nAt long last, the taco emoji is here. \nApple's iOS 9.1 update released this week includes more than 150 new emoji characters, including the oft-requested taco, a champagne bottle with a popping cork, a unicorn and even a middle finger. \nWhile the Unicode Consortium, the group overseeing emoji standards across platforms, first showed off its latest line-up of new emoji earlier this year, it's up to each company to then include the new characters in future operating system updates. \nThe new emoji are available for iPhone users with a software update. This is Apple's third iOS 9 update, following iOS 9.0.1 and iOS 9.0.2. \nThe Unicode Consortium also shared a few new characters being considered for next year. Among them are bacon, a pregnant woman, a cowboy, a clown and a person taking a selfie. \nThe group said it considers a variety of factors in choosing which emoji to add to its line-up, including the expected usage level, image distinctiveness and how often it is requested -- proving that persistent requests for the long elusive taco have paid off.
