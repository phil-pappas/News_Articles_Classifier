(AP Photo/Charles Sykes, FILE) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Tracy Morgan returned to a familiar stage, hosting “Saturday Night Live” in his first appearance on the show since a vehicle crash that left him in a coma. \n“I was in a terrible car accident more than a year ago. It was awful, but it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world,” the comic said in his opening monologue. \n“People are wondering, ‘Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?'” he asked. “The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.” \nIn one sketch, he was joined by “30 Rock” co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer. Fey broke character to inject a serious note: “We’re so happy you’re OK. We’re even happier you’re ready to make people laugh again.” \nMorgan also brought back a couple of his familiar characters — Astronaut Jones (stranded on Mars, a la Matt Damon in “The Martian”) and animal expert Brian Fellow (joined by a real camel, who mostly cooperated). \nMorgan suffered severe head trauma in June 2014 when a truck on the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into the back of the limo van he was riding in. Comedian James “Jimmy Mack” McNair, a mentor of Morgan’s, was killed in the crash. Morgan was in a coma for two weeks. Three other passengers suffered serious injuries.
