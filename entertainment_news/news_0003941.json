That’s a choking hazard, but no matter. Twelve years later as bombs rain down on 1940s London, the child – Peter (Levi Miller) – and best friend Nibs (Lewis MacDougall) declare a war of attrition against head nun, Mother Barnabas (Kathy Burke), who is stockpiling rations and forcing the boys to eat gruel. One fateful night, pirates abseil through the home’s skylights, kidnap the slumbering children and spirit them away to Neverland, where they become the property of an ageing seadog called Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). The abducted tykes are put to work in the mines where Peter befriends a rapscallion called Hook (Garrett Hedlund) and learns he might be the chosen one of ancient prophecy. “I don’t believe in bedtime stories,” boldly declares Peter, who escapes enslavement and gallivants through Neverland in the company of Hook, snivelling sidekick Smiegel (Adeel Akhtar) and feisty tribal princess Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Pan is a visually stunning grand folly, which has been starved of naked human emotion. \nRating: 3/5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:31:22.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
