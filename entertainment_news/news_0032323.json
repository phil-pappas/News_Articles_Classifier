Using a complicated and completely made-up formula: (Quality of Show x Amount of Time Network Has Already Spent Promoting It) + (Which Studio Produces It x Length of Season) ÷ (Time Slot x Cost to Produce x Just a Wild Stab in the Dark), I predicted how high a show's chances were for being cancelled, and if it was cancelled, how many episodes would be broadcast before it was yanked from the airwaves.\nSo how did my predictions turn out?\nNow a month into the fall season not a single show has been cancelled ... officially. But one show had its episode order reduced to 10 episodes, the same number of episodes I guessed would air before this show was cancelled.\nI didn't always guess correctly, however. Three new shows have been so successful in the ratings, the networks have given them full season orders, one of which I guessed would be amongst the first shows cancelled.\nIn the gallery above, find out how the networks' newest shows are doing, and compare that with my best guesses on the season's winners and losers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:27:01.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
