The festival took place from October 6 to 10 in Potchefstroom.\nAardklop marketing manager Chrizanda Botha said while no complaints were received form festival goers, Aardklop did not approve singing Die Stem apart from when it was sung as part of the national anthem.\n\"We are not being prescriptable in their contracts in terms of what they may and may not sing; they determine their own line-ups,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:19:08.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
