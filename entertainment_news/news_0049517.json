San Jacinto Ave.\nWhy you may want to go: Council will discuss policing options\nSan Jacinto has well-documented budget issues. The city closed parks and other facilities and laid off workers last year after voters failed to pass a utility-users tax.\nThe majority of an $18 million general fund budget pays for law enforcement – including $8.5 million that will go to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department this year for police services.\nAnd those numbers don’t figure to go down any time soon.\n“Based upon the city’s current level of deployment and the anticipated increase in costs as of July 1, 2016, significant changes may be needed,” City Manager Tim Hults wrote in a report to the City Council.\nPolice costs could increase $700,000 next summer and at least one deputy position would have to be eliminated to pay for it, he wrote.\nWith that in mind, the City Council on Tuesday, Oct. 6, will discuss policing options that include continuing with the Sheriff’s Department, bringing back the municipal police department or joining other Riverside County cities in forming a new regional police force.\nCity Councilman Andrew Kotyuk said San Jacinto is investigating how to provide the best protection for the least amount of money.\n“We are looking at the next increase from the Sheriff’s Department and we’re not sure it's sustainable with what we’re doing,” he said.\nKotyuk, a member of the council’s public safety ad hoc committee with City Councilman Mark Bartel, said community volunteers will be sought to serve on a public safety committee.\n“We feel we’re not at the (staffing) level we should be,” Kotyuk said. “Instead of raising taxes, there may be other options and the public should be involved.”\nCity leaders were hoping a proposed utility tax would add $3.8 million to the budget to help cover the costs of police and fire service, but voters rejected the proposal in May after voting down a similar, but pricier, ballot measure in November.\n“We understand people can’t afford to pay more,” Kotyuk said. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to stop trying to find a solution.”\nKotyuk said the talks have nothing to do with any dissatisfaction with the Sheriff’s Department; they are strictly driven by dollars and cents.\nNone of the options include joining with Hemet to form a San Jacinto Valley police force.\n“We did look into partnering with Hemet because we’re in the same valley, but it didn’t make sense,” Kotyuk said.\nHe said that Hemet has retirement liabilities that San Jacinto would have to take on. Kotyuk added that if San Jacinto were to reactivate its police department, which was disbanded in 2004, there likely would be a different type of retirement plan.\nRestarting the San Jacinto Police Department would cost $11.1 million with an annual cost of $9 million, according to Hults’ report.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9086 or cshultz@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm9d7-b88530141z.120151002162912000gifcc9nh.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm9d7-b88530141z.120151002162912000gifcc9nh.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:12:22.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
