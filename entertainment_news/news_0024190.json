Coaches Adam Levine,Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams continued to pair up their artists for an elimination-style singing duel. \nDuring the two-hour episode, Adam, Gwen and Blake each stole one artist. \nWe again saw appearances during rehearsals by mentors Selena Gomez (Team Gwen), John Fogerty(Team Adam), Brad Paisley (Team Blake) and Missy Elliott (Team Pharrell). \nA pair of Team Blake artists got the night started: Blaine Mitchell and Blind Joe. They were assigned Bob Seger’s \"Old Time Rock and Roll.\" \nPharrell praised Blaine for hitting a high note, but sided with Blind Joe. Gwen commended Blaine for having to command the stage on his own, with Blind Joe sitting during the performance. Blake chose Blind Joe as the winner, saying there's something special about him. Adam swooped in and stole Blaine. \nCassandra Robertson and Viktor Király went head-to-head for Team Adam, singing The Tony Rich Project's \"Nobody Knows.\" \nThe judges were complimentary of Cassandra. Adam noted how well they connected with one another on stage. He added that neither of them could have done better. He declared Viktor the winner. Cassandra was eliminated. \nNext, Team Gwen's Chase Kerby and Korin Bukowski did battle with one another. Their coach gave them Regina Spektor's \"Samson.\" \nPharrell didn't think the song was in Chase's wheelhouse. It appeared he favored Korin. Gwen said music is about emotion, and there was nothing more emotional than her artists' performance. Korin moves on, and Chase goes home. \nEvan McKeel and Riley Biederer took the stage together for Team Pharrell. They covered Stevie Wonder's \"Higher Ground.\" \nAdam leaned towards Evan. Blake agreed that Evan won the battle, though he felt Riley has the more unique sound. Pharrell picked Evan, while Gwen stole Riley. \nBraiden Sunshine was matched with Team Gwen teammate Lyndsey Elm. They tackled Howard Jones' “No One Else to Blame.” \nAdam said they were both excellent, but in different ways. Blake said it would be a tough decision, suggesting to Gwen that she flip a coin. Gwen selected Braiden as the winner, calling him a \"diamond in the rough.\" Lyndsey is out of the competition. \nFor the final battle of the night, twin sisters Andi & Alex battled Chance Peña for Team Adam. They performed The Calling’s \"Wherever You Will Go.\" \nBlake said the collaboration was \"magical.\" Gwen offered similar praise. Adam suggested that the three of them should form a group. He added that this was the hardest decision he's had to make on the show. He kept Andi & Alex, but Blake stole Chance. \nNBC will air more battles Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Eastern time. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
