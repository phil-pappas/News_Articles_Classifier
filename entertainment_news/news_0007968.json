Bruce Rauner want you to think it is.\nAt the request of local unions, Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich recently spoke at a West Side union hall about the church's teachings on work and workers.\nAfter the speech, Democrat House Speaker Michael Madigan and government unions boasted that Cupich and the Catholic Church were on their side.\n\"The archbishop has said the same thing that we've been saying in Springfield,\" Madigan said.\nGovernment unions in Illinois promoted their interpretation of the archbishop's comments online.\n\"Cupich today reaffirmed the Catholic Church's longstanding commitment to collective bargaining, to unions … a message a certain governor might want to consider,\" Service Employees International Union posted on its Facebook page.\nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees posted a picture of Cupich and wrote, \"We couldn't agree more. LIKE and SHARE if you do, too!\"\nHere's the problem: Cupich didn't say he agrees with Madigan, SEIU, AFSCME or any other government union on any issues. In his remarks, Cupich referenced the debate over whether Illinois should become the nation's 26th right-to-work state — but was careful not to say where he and the church stood on the issue.\n\"The archbishop has not taken a position,\" said Susan Burritt, archdiocesan spokeswoman. \"The archbishop never offered a judgment on any legislation.\"\nThere's an important reason why: The Catholic Church doesn't have a position on the matter.\n\"The church supports the right of workers to join unions. Catholic social teaching has never, however, taught that workers are required to join unions — let alone be forced to join unions,\" said Samuel Gregg, research director at the Acton Institute, a conservative think tank that studies the intersection of religion and public policy.\nIllinois is not a right-to-work state, which means that if a union exists in your workplace then you must be a member or pay the union nonmember fees to keep your job.\nRauner argues that this forced unionism deters companies from creating jobs in Illinois. It's also wreaking havoc on the state budget. Unionized government workers make up less than 5 percent of the Illinois population, but their salaries, benefits and pensions consume more than 25 percent of state tax dollars.\nMadigan and government unions are fierce opponents of any union reform, especially a right-to-work law.\nIt's no secret why. Both need the system to stay exactly the way it is today to protect their own political power.\nIn blocking right-to-work laws, Madigan ensures that government union executives have a steady stream of cash to use on lobbying and campaign contributions. Union executives use this money to support Madigan-backed legislation and candidates. They tell their members to vote for Madigan-backed candidates … who, once elected, support Madigan-backed legislation. This relationship between Madigan and government union executives has been on the \"rinse and repeat\" cycle for decades.\nSo after Cupich's speech, Madigan and the government unions distorted Cupich's comments and the Catholic Church's position on unions to create the perception of momentum against Rauner.\nAs a lifelong, practicing Catholic, seeing Madigan and the unions attempt to co-opt the church felt like my home was being invaded.\nSo let's be very clear about where the Catholic Church stands on this issue.\nCatholics are required to work toward achieving just wages, safe and healthy working environments, access to health care and basic necessities. The church cares deeply about protecting the weak and vulnerable and believes all work honors the dignity of the individual. Church teachings say that workers should be free to join unions — if they so choose. But the church has never held that unions are the only way to achieve the above goals, or that anyone should be forced to support a union.\nIf the church ever decides to opine on this issue, there's a strong case to be made that the Catholic position would be to support right-to-work laws.\nWorkers are better off in right-to-work states. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these states have lower minority unemployment and double the jobs growth rate. Another federal agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, reports that personal income grows faster in right-to-work states.\nUnions are better off in right-to-work states too. Indiana added more than 50,000 union jobs after it enacted a right-to-work law, according to an Indiana Public Media report. After Michigan became a right-to-work state, a ranking teachers union official said he had to explain the value of union membership to educators, and that, \"We're stronger because of it.\"\nThen there is the matter of respecting individuals' dignity: In a union, workers are not judged by the quality or fruit of their actions, but by their position on a union salary schedule. Particularly in government unions, workers who have nothing in common are lumped into the same bargaining unit, and their unique roles and contributions to the workplace are ignored.\nThat's not Catholic at all.\nHere's what else isn't Catholic: Forcing single moms to pay more for their groceries and gas to fund a bloated state government. Asking struggling families to pay higher taxes to pay for exorbitant government pensions. The time when Attorney General Lisa Madigan and the Illinois Democrat machine forced Catholic institutions in Illinois to stop providing foster care and adoption services. Or in 2010, when Speaker Madigan's caucus blocked a school voucher bill that would allow kids at the worst public schools in the city the chance of a better education elsewhere — such as at one of the Archdiocese of Chicago's excellent Catholic schools.\nAs a Catholic, I'm all for solidarity: caring for others, respecting people as individuals, fighting against inequality and injustice. But Speaker Madigan, AFSCME and SEIU: We're not on the same team. Your version of solidarity has no place in the Catholic Church.\nDiana Sroka Rickert is a writer with the Illinois Policy Institute.
