The crew gave their tips for entertaining. Like using candles for ambiance or keeping the invitations down to a smaller amount. They spoke about trends like harem pants that have a dropped crotch, men wearing dress shoes without socks, cat cafes where homeless cats can walk around and interact with people while they are having coffee or a drink and could very well adopt the cats.\nThey introduced Eddie Jackson , who recently won the “Next Food Network Star.” This ex-NFL football player is a great chef, and his show is called “Barbeque Blitz.” He made his recipe for Spicy Rum Marinated Grilled Chicken Wings, and Mario helped. They made the marinade and put in a zipper plastic bag and added the wings. When ready to cook, he reduced the rest of the marinade in a saucepan and used it to brush the wings while grilling. Eddie and Mario were blindfolded and given food dipped in barbeque sauce, and they had to guess what it was. Eggroll, carrot and ice cream sandwich and Eddie got them all correct, guess he uses barbeque sauce on everything!\nMichael is exhausted by Sunday, and loves his man cave. He showed viewers his Midwestern Cheese Dip as he sat by his toaster oven in his recliner. He mixed cream cheese, cheddar, chopped up corned beef and then asked Clinton, via ringing a bell for his manservant, for mustard and a pepper mill. Meanwhile, Carla was making her Spicy Peanut Popcorn Balls.\nClinton kicked up his Craft Corner by answering a viewer’s question about having lots of DVDs around that she did not want to throw away. He put a coating of glass paint on the shiny side in different colors. They cut the DVDs in irregular pieces and bought a serving tray that they glued on the bottom of the trays in a wave design. Once it is complete, he suggested brushing it with about three or four coats of clear acrylic to make it waterproof. This mosaic can be used on picture frames, flower pots or anything you want to make look attractive on this economical episode of \"The Chew.\"", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Kelly_%28TV_personality%29", "http://abc.go.com/shows/the-chew/co-hosts/Michael--Symon", "http://abc.go.com/shows/the-chew/episode-guide/2015-10/07-entertain-on-a-shoestring", "http://www.mariobatali.com/", "http://www.carlahall.com/", "http://www.daphneoz.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:44:56.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
