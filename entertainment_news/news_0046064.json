Photo: Steve Gullick \nEarlier this year, performing at the Laneway Festival in Melbourne, British producer Jon Hopkins was confronted with a strange sight. Towards the end of his set, a sizeable portion of the crowd had taken off a single shoe and, still beaming at Hopkins, held them aloft as they continued to dance.\n\"I could tell it wasn't supposed to be an insult, but I had no idea what it was,\" says Hopkins.\nHe took to Twitter to find out and was informed of the significance of the brandished shoes, a tradition born at Golden Plains Festival in Meredith to indicate that the artist on stage had performed the best set of the festival.\nIn other words, the crowd – who were going absolutely bananas – had crowned Hopkins king of Laneway.\nAdvertisement \"I felt that particularly the Melbourne and the Sydney Laneways were the best shows I had on that tour and probably the best I've ever had in Australia, they were amazing,\" he says.\n\"You probably find a lot of musicians say this but when the crowd is enthusiastic it makes for a much better performance, it's not like you're trying harder, it just happens better when the crowd is so behind you.\"\nHopkins' crowds have grown significantly over the past few years, largely due to the success of his fourth studio album, 2013's Immunity .\nA glitchy, cerebral record of ambient electronica, it was also Hopkins' most dance floor-friendly release to date, and its success in Europe and the US turned the niche artist and longtime collaborator – with everyone from Imogen Heap to Brian Eno to King Creosote to Coldplay – into a sought-after solo act.\nIt was Eno – who met Hopkins through a mutual acquaintance, guitarist Leo Abrahams – who brought Hopkins in to co-produce and perform on Coldplay's  Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends  in 2008.\nWhat was the biggest thing he learned from working with Eno?\n\"In my experience with him – he gets turned off by the idea of sitting and tweaking things for hours and hours and obviously I do quite a lot of that,\" says Hopkins, who studied piano at London's Royal College of Music as a teenager.\n\"I still do that at the end process but he's really inspiring in terms of getting you moving quickly and getting ideas down quickly ... as long as you capture that original spark of inspiration that can be a real magic and I think he got me working that way.\"\nIt's a good way to work when you're as busy as Hopkins. In the past two years he's performed more than 165 shows internationally, released an Asleep Versions  EP of stripped-back Immunity tracks, done a compilation for the esteemed Late Night Tales series and a film soundtrack, and recently scored a production of Hamlet at the Barbican starring Benedict Cumberbatch.\nAdd to that a six-month residency on BBC Radio 1 and it doesn't leave time for much else, including the anticipated follow-up to Immunity .\nBar a few sporadic shows over the next few months (including a visit to Australia at the end of the year), Hopkins plans to clear the schedule to focus on the new record.\nLike Immunity , which followed the arc of a night out with frenzied peaks and contemplative troughs, the album will be based around a unifying concept.\n\"I don't want to make just a collection of tracks,\" says Hopkins.\n\"I love the album format and I don't care if no one in the world listens to the album format any more, I still do and I think 60 minutes is a great length of time to tell a whole story.\"\nA devotee of transcendental meditation since January (two years ago, after doing a remix for David Lynch, Hopkins was invited to the director and meditation guru's LA home for coffee), Hopkins is curious to see the effects of the practice on his work.\n\"From what I've read ... I think it will maybe break down barriers to working, I'll probably spend less time procrastinating and have a purer vision,\" he says.\n\"I don't really know yet. I'm kind of excited to find out.\"\nJon Hopkins performs at the Lost Paradise Paradise festival in NSW, December 29-31, and Let Them Eat Cake, Werribee Park, in Melbourne's outer west on January 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:54:09.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
