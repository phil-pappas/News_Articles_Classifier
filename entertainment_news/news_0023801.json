In the famous words of Yoda, \"That is why you fail.\"\nA number of \"Star Wars\" fans are hoping the force will be with them in hindering the success of the franchise's seventh installment, releasing in theaters on Dec. 18.\nThe trailer for the highly anticipated film premiered during \"Monday Night Football,\" but a few fans were less than pleased with the total sum of camera time given to newcomer John Boyega, who plays Stormtrooper Finn.\nIn short timing, the small troop of protesters urged a boycott of the movie, claiming J.J. Abrams, the film’s director and producer, is working to promote \"white genocide,\" an unforgivable transgression that might leave an impact on other Hollywood blockbusters.\n\"#BoycottStarWarsVII If white people aren't wanted in Star Wars, then our money must not be either,\" tweeted @OfficialCritDis.\nTwitter user @genophilia managed to drag Black Lives Matter activist Deray Mckesson into a dig about the film . \"A friend in LA said #StarWarsVII is basically \"Deray in Space.\" Jewish activist JJ Abrams is an anti-white nut. #BoycottStarWarsVII.\"\nThe hashtag was swiftly hijacked and obliterated by the movie’s rational fans who noted \"Star Wars\" has always included characters from different cultural backgrounds; James Earl Jones provided the voice for Darth Vader and Billy Dee Williams played Landon Carlrissian.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/officialCritDis/status/655937941194285056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/genophilia/status/656107591995494400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:11:10.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
