Photograph by: David Cooper , Supplied \nDisgraced \nUntil October 18 at The Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage \nTickets and info: artsclub.com \nWhether it’s a meal with the extended family as in August Osage County or plates of clafoutis in God of Carnage, sharing food in American theatre is generally a fraught endeavour. \nThis is certainly true of Ayad Akhtar’s funny and harrowing Disgraced, which opened the Arts Club’s 2015-2016 season at the Stanley last week. \nDisgraced centres on a young lawyer named Amir Kapoor, played by Patrick Sabongui, and his painter wife Emily, played by Kyra Zagorsky, both of whom are on the cusp of glittering careers in the fields. The trouble is that Amir struggles with his past — he was raised Muslim but has left the religion and his family behind and embarked on an aggressive path of assimilation, going so far as to change his name to appear Indian rather than Pakistani. \nBut Emily has fallen in love with the religion. Inspired by a mosque they saw on their honeymoon in Spain, she has begun a naive act of cultural appropriation in her artistic practise. The show opens with her painting Amir in the style of Velazques’ portrait of Juan de Pareja, a slave who the painter later freed and who became an artist in his own right. \nThe complicated levels of meaning in this moment reverberate throughout the play. Akhtar’s script makes tremendous use of the irony of different levels of perception and the ways those perceptions empower and disempower different characters. It takes time for the play to hit its stride. In the first scene, it feels as though Sabongui and Zagorsky are having trouble balancing the light, jokey tone of their dialogue with the tension under the surface. Zagorsky has the particular challenge of acting against a very noticeable blond wig. \nThe appearance of other characters gets the show moving. \nConor Wylie's youthful exuberance as Amir's nephew offers a heartbreaking counterpoint to Amir's mix of danger and vulnerability. The younger man's presence adds depth to the field. \nRobert Moloney displays whip smart comic timing as the Jewish art dealer Isaac and Marci T House is a joy to watch as his African American wife and Amir's coworker Jory. And when the four finally sit down to dinner, sparks fly. \nJanet Wright's deft direction leaves very little escape from the difficult topics that arise as the tension heightens. Even when they retreat into the kitchen, the characters remain visible to the audience. \nThe script sometimes calls up stereotypes for effect. Isaac invokes Woody Allen and Jory refers in passing to having gotten out of \"the ghetto.\" Emily’s naive worldview occasionally reaches Gwyneth Paltrow heights. But thanks to the nuanced performances of the cast as well as Akhtar's smart writing, this feels more like a way to confront the audience's expectations and preconceived notions. \nIt's difficult even to write about these characters without distilling them to oversimplified identity markers--Muslim, Jewish, African American, White--but isn't that what happens every day? \nIt's a question that will stay with you long after the 80 minute running time. \nor visit vancouversun.com/typo. \nIs there more to this story?
