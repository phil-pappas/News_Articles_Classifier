I sound weird saying that, but yes.\" \nJustin was also forced to defend his physique last March after he was accused of relying on photoshop when he appeared topless on the cover of Men's Health magazine. \nHe tweeted at the time: \"I love the fact that I got in shape the past two years, and I'm finally getting recognition for it. It's not photoshopped for all you fools out there saying it's photoshopped.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:47:40.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
