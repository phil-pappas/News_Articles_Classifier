Kalki has a very distinct sense of style.\"\nThe 29-year-old 'Piku' star was speaking at the launch of her own clothing brand \"All About You\" in partnership with Myntra.\nDeepika said while growing up, she admired the way Hema Malini and Sridevi used to \"conduct and carried\" themselves.\nThe actress is also a fan of superstar Shah Rukh Khan and her ex-boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor's sense of style.\n\"I think Shah Rukh dresses really well. Personally, he has a style which I would want a man to have that is basic jeans and T-shirt and he also seems very comfortable in what he wears. Ranbir Kapoor is someone who has a very interesting personal style,\" she said.\nWhile Deepika did not name her rumoured boyfriend Ranveer Singh among the male actors whose dressing sense she likes, she heaped praise on him when asked about her opinion on his fashion choices.\n\"I think he is also someone, who has a very distinct style. He is someone in a sense who embodies what 'All About You' is. We as a brand believe it is really about you, what you believe in and clothes that you wear are extension of your personality.\n\"I believe his style expresses that. He is someone who is very expressive, very confident and has a lot of energy, enthusiasm and all of that comes through in the clothes that he wears,\" the actress said.\nDeepika feels a stylist's role has become very important for the actors, which was not the case when she began her career.\n\"A lot of girls dress up really well. I remember when I started a few years ago there was no concept of stylist. Now it is a prerequisite for every actor both men and women.\nEveryone has an interesting and distinctive style.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:34.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
