It has been confirmed that Analeigh Tipton (\" Manhattan Love Story \") and Stephen Merchant (\" Hello Ladies \") will guest star in the currently airing ninth season of the hit comedy series. The two will appear in episode 9 of the season. While CBS won't disclose the roles they will play, audience members who attended the taping of the said episode reported that Tipton and Merchant would play dates for Sheldon and Amy respectively. This won't be the first time Tipton appearing on the show though. The actress, who was an \" America's Next Top Model \" finalist, made a cameo on the CBS sitcom seven years ago as herself. Earlier this year, showrunner Steve Molaro hinted at the status of Sheldon and Amy's relationship in season 9, saying that producers planned to keep them apart \"until the time feels right.\" \"Right now, the dynamic has been fascinating and interesting,\" he explained. \"We're seeing all new colors for both of them as well as the way it impacts the group. There's not a set plan - we're feeling this out along in same way Amy is.\" \"The Big Bang Theory\" airs Mondays at 8 P.M. on CBS. It will move to its regular time period beginning Thursday, November 5 at 8 P.M. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More The Big Bang Theory News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:50:56.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
