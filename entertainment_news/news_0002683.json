Derren Brown \nTalking to the Press Association, Brown said: “First and foremost it’s a theme park attraction, the psychological part of it is a layer to it but its ultimate reason for existing is to thrill. So, it’s a theme park attraction that I’ve come up with over the last three years, working with the Thorpe Park guys trying to push the boundaries of what’s possible.” \nThe attraction is set to open in March 2016. \nBrown admitted he’s a lover of theme parks and roller coasters but says he finds they are “over a little quickly”, so his attraction will be 13 minutes long. \n“It’s a long journey, it’s a fully immersive thing you’re in for a big chunk of time,” he said. Derren Brown \nConstruction on the new attraction has started, and a team of 1,000 specialists and experts are working on the project. \nHe added: “This new attraction is a major first for the industry, and I think it might be the future of theme parks. \n“In 10 to 15 years, I can only imagine they will all feature fully immersive, individual experiences, and this may be the first step in that direction. I believe we are moving toward a future where theme park attractions not only give you a physical experience but also play with your mind and the concept of what is real.” \nBrown said he’s always tried to do things that feel like they are “fun and exciting”. \n“I’ve never had ambitions to do a show in Vegas or conquer America, so it’s only ever been what’s fun and interesting at the time,” he said.

It’s something very different, it’ll be there for ages and I’m just excited to see what people make of it.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:03:58.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
