Working for people sucks. Having to get out of bed, put on clothes, and go somewhere other than your bed sucks. But we all have to do it on a regular basis because having money does not suck. A tie that binds, more so than anything else, is our unified ability to go out there into the world and stomach spoonfuls of nonsense with a smile on our face for the sole purpose of money, money, money, bitch. (Sorry, was just quoting Broad City there.)\nA way to balance all of this out, simply, is to cut loose and lose your actual mind every so often, in whatever way that makes sense for you to do. In the spirit of this, we salute this Southampton High School principal for rolling down her pantyhose and twerking her face off in a video for JR's \"Best Friends,\" featuring Trey Songz that, unfortunately, got her fired from her job.\nAlright, so she didn't exactly \" twerk her face off.\" At all. The principal, Esther Adler-O'Keefe makes a brief, and innocent appearance as a homeowner going on vacation with her husband in the opening seconds of the video. And yet still, her higher ups were not pleased.\n\"The video in question showcases behaviors and language use that is not promoted by the Southampton School District,\" the superintendent Dr. Scott Farina told the Southampton Press . \"In fact, we actively teach our students the importance of good character and making smart choices. Additionally, this is not representative of who we are as a district, nor of our students and staff.\"\nHard to agree with anyone who feels as though being in a video that's almost 100% butts is a bad choice. We applaud you, Ms. Adler-O’Keefe, even though you later tried to say that you didn't know the video would be \"like that.\"\nIn an emailed statement in response to requests from her local press for comment, Ms. Adler-O’Keefe said that she knew nothing about the video when she agreed to star in it. “Speaking as a private individual and not in my professional capacity, I wish to state for the record that, when I agreed to participate, I was completely unaware of the content, lyrics, and title of the video and song.\"\nHmmm...I guess we'll just have to take your word on that.\nh/t Gawker", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-jwocALzUe0", "http://gawker.com/high-school-principal-not-a-principal-anymore-after-app-1736693174", "http://giphy.com/gifs/broad-city-ilana-wexler-broadcityedit-xkb4Kg0TiYLwA", "http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/Southampton-Village-Surrounding-Areas/122955/Southampton-High-School-Assistant-Principal-Stars-In-Popular-Music-Video", "http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/Southampton-Village-Surrounding-Areas/126305/Esther-Adler-OKeefe-To-Take-On-New-Administrative-Duties-In-Southampton-School-District"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:52:17.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
