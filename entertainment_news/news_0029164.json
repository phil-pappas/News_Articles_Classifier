Fox star in “Back to the Future” (1985, USA). \nRockland — The 1985 science fiction comedy film “Back to the Future” will be screened Wednesday, Oct. 21, at 7 p.m. as Part 2 of the Flashback Film Fest presented by the Strand Theatre, 345 Main St. “Dirty Dancing” (1987, USA) will be shown as Part 3 Wednesday, Nov. 25, at 7 p.m. \nIn “Back to the Future,” high schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is browbeaten by his principal at school and must endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father (Crispin Glover) and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's father's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), who is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now-teenaged parents. He must reunite his parents-to-be … or cease to exist in the 1980s. \nFans may remember that in Part 2 of the “Back the Future” film trilogy, Doc and Marty travel from 1985 to Oct. 21, 2015, the day this screening takes place. The film is rated PG. Tickets are $8.50, $7.50 for senior citizens and those younger than 12.
