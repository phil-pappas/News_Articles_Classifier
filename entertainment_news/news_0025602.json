The comedian was playing Sauti Solâ€™s Isabella as his girlfriend watched him lying on top of the piano with a glass of wine beside her. \nHe uploaded not only one but three videos showing his elated girlfriend being wooed by his singing. \nEric had surprised Shantel when she flew into the country with a dance from the FBI crew at JKIA, welcoming her with flowers and kisses. \nLooks like Eric is showing Kenyan men how to be romantic when it comes to treating your girl special.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:47:44.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
