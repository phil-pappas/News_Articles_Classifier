Brand knows he's a joke, and he makes himself the punchline as he analyses everything from his embarrassing performance at the Oscars to the time he tried to join the Marines.\nHe laughs at Nick Kyrgios using girlfriend slurs to rattle his opponents, and taboo topics such as Adolf Hitler's childhood.\nThe best part about Brand, however, is the love that radiates from him.\nHe spends 20 minutes of the show mingling with the audience, hugging grown men wearing funny hats and riding in the lap of a woman in a wheelchair in the front row.\nHe constantly tells hecklers in the crowd he loves them and enthusiastically informs the 6000-strong crowd they can be part of a change.\nWhile news organisations like Fox are telling us to fear immigration, says Brand, we should love our neighbours instead.\n\"Those people who want us to hate each other are just greedy little wankers,\" he says in his swashbuckling Englishaccent.\nThis is what makes him so great. While other comedians get on stage and bemoan the world's problems, Brand also presents a solution.\nIt is easily to be sceptical about this casanova, but in his presence, you're sucked in. \n\"I hope I'm reaching out to the real you. The you when you're feeling alone at 3am because I am you,\" he says.\nThe effect Brand has on people is indisputable; when he finishes his set, dozens of people rush up to him, and he gleefully enters the scrum to high-five and hug every fan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:30:13.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
