Photo: Supplied \nGAMES\nPRISON ARCHITECT, PC/Mac \nPrisons (like submarines) have always made great dramatic fare – it's no accident The Shawshank Redemption is the top-rated film on IMDB. Jails often play a bit-part in games, too – it's a common device to find your character coming to their senses in a cell, then having to find a way out – but we can't recall an entire game being devoted to the genre until now. Prison Architect – which was partly designed by players before its official release – takes the time-worn mechanics of simulations like Sim City but applies  them to the operation of a privately run US-style maximum security detention facility, which you must first build (as the name suggests) then successfully operate. On a basic level, there's fun to be had making your jail escape-proof, but as you get the hang of it and the incarcerated community flourishes, you find what you're really doing is running a business – the more inmates you can house, the more money you make. Problems arise. Are prisoners killing each other in the hospital because you forgot to staff it with guards? Do you hire a psychologist to aid the inmates' rehabilitation, or do you rule with an iron fist of lockdowns and solitary confinement? Dark, but compelling. AH\nGames: Prison Architect . Photo: supplied \nDVD\nAdvertisement LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN, Fox (PG) \nNo one who has seen John M. Stahl's 1945 melodrama could possibly forget the eerily tranquil scene at its centre: Gene Tierney with her heart-shaped sunglasses and deep red cupid's bow lips, rowing calmly across a blue-green lake as smooth as glass. Tierney has a glassy quality of her own as the enigmatic Ellen Berent, an anti-heroine who puts most modern pop culture villains in the shade. On the one hand Ellen is portrayed as a helpless victim of her own passions, a woman who simply \"loves too much\". But she's also an amoral force of nature whose transgressive speeches and actions – referring to a disabled young boy as a \"cripple\", or looking with disgust at her own pregnant body in a mirror – have lost none of their power to shock. The film is obliged to pretend that it belongs to the side of sanity, personified by the weak-willed novelist (Cornel Wilde) Ellen chooses as her husband. But Stahl's Technicolour images prove otherwise, charging the whole of nature with an intensity equal to Ellen's own.

We're the pokie capital of the world with more machines and a higher spend than anyone else; Australians are losing a gob-smacking $12 billion (billion!) a year on the one-armed bandits. Filmmakers Neil Lawrence and Mitzi Goldman explore the history of pokies and investigate exactly what it is that makes them addictive, through interviews with game designers, neuroscientists, anthropologists and addicts – and their findings are astounding. Pokie machines are now considered as addictive as cocaine and heroin in the psychiatric \"bible\", DSM , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . They also reveal how the machines are deliberately programmed to be addictive, and follow the Gillard government's unsuccessful attempt to reel in the industry. Given the revenue made by governments, it's unlikely pokies are going away any time soon but let's hope this revealing – and ultimately quite depressing – film will at least deter some from the lure of these insidious machines, which are programmed to win. KN\nUnsettling: The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst . Photo: supplied \nDOCUMENTARY\nTHE JINX:  THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF ROBERT DURST, Roadshow (MA 15+) \nJustice was done when this incredible doco won an Emmy in September for outstanding documentary or nonfiction series. Backed by HBO, the series (six episodes) does more than put the magnifying glass  on the life of reclusive real estate icon Robert Alan Durst, it puts the collar on him, too. Durst, born into an old money family in New York, was the black sheep of the family. With the show hinting he may have witnessed his own father Seymour driving his mum to death (jumping off the roof of the family home), he definitely takes on some pathological characteristics of his own as an adult. Durst was a suspect in the death of his own wife, Kathleen, a longtime friend, Susan Berman, and an elderly neighbour in Texas, Morris Black. He has never been convicted of murder, but is currently in custody in a prison mental-health unit in New Orleans on a murder warrant from California. Durst's story is intriguing and complex, and is told in an irresistible fashion. The storytellers deserve kudos: director Andrew Jarecki​ (who made a dramatic movie, All Good Things , out of the Durst story); and producers Marc Smerling (who created the Catfish doco about the perils of social networking) and Jason Blum (the brains behind Whiplash , The Reader and Paranormal Activity ). JK\nA scene from Jacques Rivette's Gang of Four (1988). Photo: supplied \nDVD\nGANG OF FOUR, Bluebell Unrated \nThe films of Jacques Rivette​ rarely stray far from Paris, but it's rightly been said that Rivette's Paris is never the same place twice. The city of this comic-sinister 1988 mystery is a brownish-grey blur, autumn fading into winter, the young heroines rugging up in scarves and baggy pullovers as they commute by train from their house in the suburbs to the theatre where they attend acting classes with a strict teacher played by Rivette axiom Bulle Ogier. Against this background of routine, the usual kind of Rivette intrigue takes shape, via the tales of conspiracy spun by Thomas (Benoit Regent), a middle-aged Don Juan who invades the girls' lives for reasons that are never wholly clear. This is the first film in which Rivette, one of the great chroniclers of the 1970s counterculture, focuses squarely on the new generation of the 1980s – and what he gives us is a study of the premature weariness of youth, centred on characters who spend their time slouching, trading idle banter, and puzzling over glimpses of a battle waged by their elders above their heads.
