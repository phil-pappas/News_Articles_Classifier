Peih-Gee, who previously competed on Survivor: China, became the third castaway voted out of the all-star game when a surprise tribal swap placed pressure on her alliance when four members of her old Ta Keo tribe wound up together on a brand new beach and started over from scratch. But rather than sticking together to make sure they had the numbers on their side at tribal council, a rift between Peih-Gee and her arch-rival Abi-Maria Gomes, led to her ultimate ouster. \n“Survivor is not fair. We’ve seen this time and time again. But it’s how you adapt to it,” Law explained to Postmedia Network on Friday, following her eventful elimination episode. \nAfter multiple rifts with her on-and-off-again ally and multiple trips to tribal council since arriving in Cambodia, an unprecedented tribe swap hinted at a new life in the game for many when Jeff Probst uttered the classic words, “Drop your buffs.” \n“I just started forming really good bonds with everybody on my tribe and then it’s chaos again. But you get a little bit bored out there sometimes. It’s exciting to mix things up,” she said regarding the swap. \nBut when the bickering continued with Abi-Marie into their new Angkor tribe, Peih-Gee ended up on the losing end of the feud when the “Brazilian dragon” had campaigned to get her out. \n“I’m positive that if we weren’t on the same tribe that I wouldn’t be speaking to you right now. I’m not really one to hold a grudge and I can get over things pretty fast but other people can’t and I should have anticipated that a little bit more. With that said, it still shouldn’t have been me last night.” \nAlthough Peih-Gee did her best to ensure she had the remaining tribe members on her side, former Bayon-players Andrew Savage and Tasha Fox chose to ultimately side with Abi. \n“The only thing I can think is that Tasha and Savage didn’t see any of Abi-Maria’s unpredictableness firsthand. They only had my word for it that she’s really awful to work with,” she further explained. \nBut Peih-Gee has no regrets and remained upbeat when explaining her certainty that her tribe made the wrong decision in the end and that they’ll likely be paying the price in the near future. “I have a prediction that Angkor is going to keep coming back to tribal a lot.” I guess we’ll see if she’s right. \nSurvivor Cambodia: Second Chance airs Wednesdays at 8PM on CBS and Global. \nTwitter: @samomaryleona", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:10:00.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
