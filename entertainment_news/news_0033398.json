Find out more about his projects via Twitter https://twitter.com/fluffyguy and Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/GabrielIglesias ).\nQ. Have you traveled to a place that stood out so much that you felt compelled to incorporate it into your work?\nA. Oh, yes. Many of my travels have made it into my work. I have material on visiting the Middle East and going to the palace of the prince. I've been to Singapore and they are really serious about their drug laws. That has turned into a great story on stage. I also recently went to India and found new love for a dish called butter chicken and have stories about driving in India. A lot of my travel experiences make their way into the set.\nQ. What is your favorite vacation destination?\nA. There is so much I can recommend in Long Beach! Sunday brunch on the Queen Mary is amazing. I'm talking ice sculptures and a harp player, along with an amazing buffet spread. The Black Bear Diner in Signal Hill is also a favorite spot of mine.\nQ. What untapped destination should people know about?\nA. It's always the smaller cities in the countries that we visit that surprise us about how amazing they are. Stavanger, Norway, is beautiful. Singapore was amazing. The Singapore Zoo is a rainforest zoo. It is hands down the best zoo that I have ever been to. I would go back to Singapore just to see that zoo!\nQ. What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\nA. I always travel light and only bring a carry-on. When you travel as much as I do, you want to spend the least amount of time in an airport. I have recently applied for NEXUS ( http://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus ) and have Global Entry. If you have the time to get those, I would recommend it. It gets you through security so much faster.\nQ. Where have you traveled to that most reminded you of home?\nA. No place ever feels like home, but San Antonio and El Paso have always been a second home to me.\nQ. Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\nA. Kuwait. I have only been to the military base before; Finland, which we are going to very soon. Germany. I have never performed there. I really want to visit the Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen in Wolfsburg. I have been collecting VWs for the last few years. If I can get the time off, that is a goal.\nQ. What are your favorite hotels?\nA. The Kimpton ( https://www.kimptonhotels.com/ ) and Starwood ( http://www.starwoodhotels.com/index.html ) hotel chains are always my favorite. They seem to cater more to the entertainment industry and I feel the most at home there. They have some of the best room service at these chains. When you perform until 10 p.m. and want room service at midnight, 24-hour room service is a true blessing.\nQ. When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\nA. Phone charger and backup chargers and backup-backup phone power. I must have power!\nQ. What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\nA. Everything that my fans bring me. They always bring me cakes, cupcakes and cookies. I've been cutting out carbs, so these are truly guilty pleasures now.\nQ. What is your worst vacation memory?\nA. The worst situations usually involve delayed or canceled flights. Once we were hung over and driving in a blizzard to the airport, only to find out that the flight was canceled and I could have stayed in bed.\n===", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/fluffyguy", "http://automuseum.volkswagen.de/en.html", "http://www.starwoodhotels.com/index.html", "https://www.facebook.com/GabrielIglesias", "https://blackbeardiner.com/", "https://www.kimptonhotels.com/", "http://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:26:40.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
