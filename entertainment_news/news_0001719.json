The program is sponsored by the Mussel Ridge Historical Society. \nThe film “Living at the Light: A History of the Owls Head Lighthouse” is a blend of history and several human-interest stories, including those of two people who lived at the lighthouse. The late Marla Rogers is featured, describing her life growing up in the 1950s with her family at the light; and Paul Dilger describes his experiences as a Coast Guardsman with his wife living at the light in 2003. “Living at the Light” takes the viewer back to when the lighthouse was built high above Penobscot Bay in 1825. The film later explores some beloved stories associated with the light, including the Frozen Lovers in 1850 and Spot the Dog in the 1930s. \nThe event is free and open to the public. The Historical Society hopes folks attending will bring their or their families’ stories and/or memorabilia about the Owl’s Head Light to share, adding to the history of this part of Owls Head. There will be a scanner available for documents or pictures that people are willing to share. \nAttendees will be able to purchase copies of the DVD after the presentation, and filmmaker Mathieson will be on hand to autograph them. In addition, light refreshments will be provided. For more information or to share stories, contact Kay Dodge at 596-6879 or email musselridge@earthlink.net. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
