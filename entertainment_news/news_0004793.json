On Monday's Good Morning America , the actress explained why. \n\"It was just a situation where...it was two people in a play and I was offered less than half what the male was offered,\" she recalled. \"And I was pretty certain that if it was two men, that that wouldn't have happened.\" \nMiller said there's only one way actresses can gain equal pay. \n\"I think everybody has to come together to do something,\" she said. \"It's think it's outrageous in this day and age when women are doing the same jobs as men that we are undervalued to that degree. But I also think it comes from within women. I think there is a global conversation happening that is really inspiring, but it's gonna take sacrifice.\" \nHer Burnt co-star Bradley Cooper already told Reuters hat he's willing to help by speaking out about the pay disparity in Hollywood base on gender. \nIt's the second time Miller has co-starred with Cooper on the big screen, after the two starred in American Sniper . The two play top chefs in Burnt . \nMiller said on GMA that working on the movie she learned how a kitchen works. \"[I] understand more the way that a restaurant is run. And if food sits on a path for more than two minutes, they have to throw it all away in that kind of restaurant,\" she explained. \"So if somebody went to the bathroom when the food was ready, they would have to start again. You know, little things that you'd pick up.\" \nBurnt , also starring Uma Thurman and Matthew Rhys, is out Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:00:36.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
