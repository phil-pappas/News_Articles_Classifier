But there’s a lot about your new video we just can’t get behind. \nAfter leaving us for so long, you’ve returned and possibly left us with even more questions than we already had. 1. Thanks for leaving us no room to be surprised Maybe adele's new album is going to be upbeat?*Cut to opening scene of music video – dead flies in sepia on window ledge* Hmm, maybe not \n— Snukes (@QueerDiscOx) October 23, 2015 \nIn all honesty, we always knew what to expect from a new Adele song, but the thought did briefly cross our minds – could it be something completely different, after a four-year hiatus?! – before we saw the very first second of the video and that thought was stamped on by sepia. 2. And for that massive wait before the music *watches adele's new music video*adele: opens her eyesme: is bald \n— spooky issa (@twaimz) October 23, 2015 \nWe were wondering if we were being trolled and whether there would actually be a song. 3. How long have you been gone?! Adele has a flip-phone in \"hello\" because it's filmed in sepia which means it is set in the past. So glad my media studies a-level is useful \n— Ryan Bassil (@ryanbassil) October 23, 2015 \nThis can also be re-phrased as “WHY DO YOU HAVE A FLIP PHONE?!” \nThe worst part? It’s not even a Razr. 4. Who taught you how to make tea? Didnt wanna say it but just because you're Adele it doesn't mean you can pour the water before the tea bag is in hun pic.twitter.com/R6FbmCLxa2 \n— Joshua Dixon (@JoshDixonTweets) October 23, 2015 \nBecause they should be at the Hague for crimes against humanity. 5. Great. Lionel Ritchie is stuck in our head \nBy the time we get to the third line, Lionel Ritchie is stuck in our head, and we all know that by then it’s too late to turn back. 6. Face touching. A lot of it Adele really likes touching her face, doesn't she? \n— Mister Glister (@misterglister) October 23, 2015 \nNot just your boyfriend’s, but also your own. Does face touching help with grief? The evidence would suggest not. 7. Why’s he trying to feed you Super Noodles? (AdeleVevo/YouTube) \nEverybody knows what Super Noodles taste like. EVERYBODY. They do not need taste-testing. 8. A landline? Really Adele? Hey Adele. Maybe try him on his mobile? No one's used a landline in years. \n— Rhys James (@rhysjamesy) October 23, 2015 \nTry harder. 9. And finally, why are there people talking over the song? If u listen closely to the new Adele track u can hear every artist who plan to release albums in the next 6 months crying in the background \nThis is the only reason we would accept and also the only explanation that makes sense.
