Once they collected all three chests, they had to disassemble the cart, slide it through a barricade, put it back together and make their way to the end. Two tribe members then used the pieces in the chest to assemble a giant puzzle. Ta Keo and Bayon won immunity. \nThe shocking twist was set into motion when Jeff sent a signal to former teammate Kelly Wiglesworth after losing the challenge and was busted by Tasha. Varner went on to reveal some of the team’s private deals, upsetting his former Ta Keo members. It set off a chain of events that would eventually lead to Abi-Maria and Peih-Gee campaigning to vote each other out. \nAt the tribal council, Peih-Gee, in a last-ditch effort to stave off elimination, tried to convince the tribe they could trust her word, declaring, “I’m steady. I’m loyal.” The pitch wasn’t good enough, and she was voted off the island. \nCopyright © 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:36:22.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
