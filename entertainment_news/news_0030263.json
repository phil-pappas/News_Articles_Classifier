All of it stimulated by the anticipation of Fashion Week especially in avant garde fashion headquarters such as New York, London, Milan and Paris.\nPhoto courtesy of Alice + Olivia View all 20 photos Photo courtesy of Monica Feudi/Feudiguaineri.com Between the street style frenzies, the front row celeb sightings and the sweeping changes Lincoln Center was no longer the primary venue in New York City, a few designers switching cities, and Givenchy deciding to take the unconventional route to debuting their collection to the public for the very first time-- we were already in a tailspin before the shows even began. Despite all of the changes, we were still eager to witness the latest spring collections for 2016.\nThe last designer left standing gracefully bowed out this week, green lighting the official end to Paris Fashion Week and ergo the official end of Fashion Week (there are still a number of Fashion Weeks to go) For the aforementioned cities we noted the top moments of what was Fashion Week, moments that can only be upstaged by promising designer collections. And although there weren't as many promising collections as we had hoped for, we still were able to highlight the best collections from each city and the trends that spurred from them.\nNew York Fashion Week\nFashion trends : Monochrome, ruffles, utilitarian pieces\nTo get the party started off right New York Fashion Week kicked off a month long wanderlust of garment sightseeing with the theme centralized on Spring style. In addition to some of the best collections throughout the major cities, New York Fashion Week brought along a number of firsts, including the first designer to open a collection for public veiwing (Givenchy).\nBest S/S '16 Collections: Delpozo, Alice + Olivia, Boss, Naeem Khan, Givenchy.\nLondon Fashion Week\nFashion trends: Shimmery pieces (think sheen, metallics and foil) frilly silhouettes\nCelebs flew out to London just to brush shoulders with British insiders in and out of fashion (music stars were spotted abound) They were in good company gathering at a number of shows including Burberry and Topshop Unique.\nBest S/S '16 Collections: Erdem, Osman, Temperley London, Amanda Wakeley\nMilan Fashion Week\nTrends: Gallant color, art-pop motifs\nMilan is the ultimate template for designers to bring out their best interpretation of robust Italian aesthetics--as seen at Dolce & Gabbana , Alberto Ferratti and a number of other collections. Other designers continued to position themselves at the forefront of Italian fashion most notably Giorgio Armani and Fendi.\nBest S/S '16 Collections : Dsquared2, Giorgio Armani, Etro, Jil Sander, Fendi\nParis Fashion Week\nFashion trends: Sheer fabrics, luxe leather\nParis was the last city to wrap up a full scale month of fashion. And like New York Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week came with its own little surprise: The Row was showcasing in Paris for the first time after taking a sabbatical from New York. Shows such as Saint Laurent, Dior and Dries Van Noten were generating a buzz, but top honors belong to winning collections from Balmain, Iris van Herpen and Hermes.\nBest S/S '16 Collections : Iris van Herpen, Mugler, Hermes, Balmain, Chanel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:05:27.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
