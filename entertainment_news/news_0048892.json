Charles Joseph Gliniewicz pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Lake County Circuit Court.\nKristin Kiefer, whose 911 call the night of Sept. 2 set off a five-hour manhunt less than 10 miles away from where Gliniewicz was fatally shot, has remained free from custody after posting 10 percent of $100,000 bond following her Sept. 3 arrest.\nShe faces several counts of making a false report of an offense, obstruction of justice and making a false report to a public safety agency.\nLake County authorities said Kiefer claimed to have had car trouble the night of Sept. 2 while traveling northbound on Route 12 near Volo. Kiefer allegedly told police two men emerged from a nearby cornfield and approached her vehicle while she sat on the shoulder, according to police.\nShe claimed they asked for a ride to Wisconsin and attempted to get in the car before running away when she picked up her cellphone to call police, according to authorities.\nMore than 80 officers from regional police departments involved in investigating the Gliniewicz case responded to the area, shutting down both Route 12 and nearby Gilmer Road in an intense search that involved three helicopters and 11 canine units.\nKiefer, represented by Chicago attorney Gal Pissetzky, entered the not guilty plea before Lake County Circuit Court Judge Victoria Rossetti.\nWoman accused of faking report about Fox Lake suspects appears in court Dan Moran The Vernon Hills woman accused of filing a false police report last week claiming to have been approached by men fitting the description of suspects in the shooting of Fox Lake Police Lt.
