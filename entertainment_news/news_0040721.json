The Moon is in Cancer. Aries (March 21-April 19) \nBe prepared because your home routine will be upset in some way today. Small appliances could break down; minor breakages could occur; family arguments might break out or you might run out of something and you feel exasperated. “No coffee!” Taurus (April 20-May 20) \nThis is a mildly accident-prone day for you so pay attention to everything you say and do. In addition, it’s one loosey-goosey crazy day. Don’t shop for anything other than food or gas. Postpone important decisions for another day. Be careful in discussions with others because you might blurt something out or act without thinking. Gemini (May 21-June 20) \nAlthough your focus might be on shopping or financial matters today, this is a poor day to spend money. Only buy gas or food or a movie or something lighthearted like that. Postpone shopping needs and major decisions until tomorrow. In the meantime, guard your possessions against loss, theft or breakage. Cancer (June 21-July 22) \nSomething will happen today that makes you emotionally upset or surprised. Something that was important to you will suddenly change or be canceled. Try not to be too obsessed with something today because it will only make you suffer. Don’t spend money and avoid important decisions. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) \nThis is a restless, mildly frustrating day for you so just make the best of it. Delays, goofy mistakes, errors, transportation delays, misplaced or forgotten items will be just par for the course. Just keep a holding pattern and a smile on your face. Your party day this week is Wednesday. Friday looks swell, too! Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) \nA discussion with a female friend might upset you today. At the very least, something unexpected will come your way like a zinger out of the blue. Alternatively, you might meet someone who is unusual or different. Don’t agree to anything important. Easy does it. Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \nThis is a poor day for important discussion with authority figures, parents, bosses or the police. Forewarned is forearmed. To begin with, nothing will be accomplished because you will not achieve your objectives. And beyond that, upsets and unpredictable events might grab you by the throat. Aagghh! Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \nTravel plans will be canceled, delayed or changed in some way today. This will also apply to school schedules that impact post-secondary learning, colleges and universities. Legal decisions or medical matters will have surprises or be changed. It’s a crapshoot today. Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \nDoublecheck arrangements regarding mortgages, loans, shared property, inheritances and insurance matters. Make friends with your bank account because something unexpected could boomerang or cause things to go off the tracks. Stay on top of things so you are not caught off guard. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \nRelations with partners and close friends are dicey today. Either one of you might demand more freedom or have a real surprise for the other. Just take it slowly. Avoid important decisions. Patience is what you need to win the day because patience is the antidote to anger. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) \nYour work routine might suffer from crazy delays, mistakes, computer crashes, canceled meetings, staff shortages — you name it. Shortages with supplies are likely today. Just cope as best you can and postpone important discussions until tomorrow. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) \nParent should be extra vigilant about their kids, and people who work with children should also be mindful and aware because this is an accident-prone day for your kids. This is also a rocky day for romance because lover’s quarrels could ruin your day. If Your Birthday Is Today \nMusician-humanitarian Bob Geldof (1951) shares your birthday today. You will always fight for justice and for the underdog. You are friendly, social and fun-loving, but you always maintain your own personal dignity. Go slowly this year. There is something important to learn. The first half of this year will seem slow, but soon your efforts of the past six years will start to show results! Get out into nature this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:16:49.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
