Pic/IANS \n“We all have done a lot of research for the film as there was limited reference material available to us. And I think that is one of the main reasons we decided to tell the story.\n“The story is inspirational. I don’t think today's youth have much knowledge about their journey,” Deepika said at the song launch of the Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial here on Saturday.\nThe movie, slated to release on December 18, brings forward a love story of Mastani, who was the second wife of Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I (played by Ranveer Singh). It also features Priyanka Chopra as Bajirao's first wife, Kashibai.\nThe film's track titled 'Deewani Mastani' was launched at Day One of Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2015. The song sets the grand stage of the film showcasing opulence and magnificence.\nDeepika notes that the song is inspired by 'Mughal-E-Azam' in some sense.\n“\"We have tried to recreate Aina Mahal. It is Sanjay sir's contemporary version of the song where Mastani is besotted, and is madly in love. She is intoxicated by her love for Bajirao,\" she said.\nThe 'Piku' star asserted that the song is her grandest song, in terms of sheer scale.\n\"Within the movie itself, this song is probably the grandest thing that we have done. We had the maximum number of visitors on this, it almost became like a museum. At one point of time, we were considering to strike some deal and make it a museum. When we finished shooting the song after nine to 10 days we didn't have the heart to break it down,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:00:31.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
