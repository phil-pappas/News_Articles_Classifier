Or at least he appears to be sleeping when we first meet his character, the down and out music manager Richie Lanz, in \"Rock the Kasbah.\" \nHoled up in a dingy San Fernando Valley motel room, he's at least half listening to the shrill sounds of a woman singing Maroon 5 and deciding whether or not to sign her. He does, and promptly collects a $1200 fee from his newest client. His other client, Ronnie (Zooey Deschanel, sporting hot pants and smeared eyeliner), who also seems to double as his assistant, scolds him for playing this game and abusing the hopes — and checkbooks — of gullible dreamers. Then he takes Ronnie out to a dive bar and has her sing some cover songs. \nThis is Richie. Swindling some, going to bat for others and never really getting anywhere in the process. \nIt's an inauspicious, and grating, start to the film from \"Scrooged\" writer Mitch Glazer and \"Diner,\" and \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" director Barry Levinson. Thankfully, Murray wakes up, and the movie gets a little better, but in sum, \"Rock the Kasbah\" is a strange mishmash of snark, sincerity, slapstick and glib cultural appropriation that's redeemed in part only by the eternal charisma of Murray. \nRonnie doesn't get discovered at the bar, per se, but a drunk guy convinces Richie to take her to Afghanistan to play for the troops. From there, the movie suddenly becomes a mad-cap series of increasingly disparate events as Richie struts and jokes his way through a foreign land after Ronnie absconds with his money and passport. \nWithin a day of discovering that he's stranded in Kabul for a few weeks, he's inexplicably cruising the city's dangerous streets in a white convertible with some fedora-wearing war profiteers (Danny McBride, Scott Caan) and trading in a Keith Haring watch to bed the region's most popular prostitute (Kate Hudson). Soon enough, he's riding through the desert with Bruce Willis's short-fused mercenary soldier and discussing that time he dated Danielle Steele while on his way to negotiate a weapons sale with the leaders of a tiny village. \nThe movie is half over before Richie finally meets Salima (Leem Lubany), a Pashtun girl with a voice to kill and a penchant for Cat Stevens. He hears her singing \"Trouble\" while he's out relieving himself one night and decides that getting this girl on \"Afghan Star\" is his new purpose in life, even though it might mean death for both himself and Salima. \nIt's here that \"Rock the Kashbah's\" tone becomes a real problem. The movie wants to be both glib and emotionally resonant, but it can't seem to figure out what the stakes are — even as people are getting shot. \nWhen Richie's with the war profiteers and Willis's Bombay Brian, the outlandish caricatures almost work, making the movie feel like a loopy, exaggerated fever-dream with no actual political stance. But everything goes awry once the focus shifts to Salima and her determination to defy her family, village and traditions to pursue her passion of singing on a reality television show. \nThis story is probably about the wrong character. Richie is a sideshow. Salima is the heart. Here, she's reduced to an exotic means of redemption for a character we barely care about. \nLevinson and Glazer try to weave \"Rock the Kasbah\" into a complex tapestry of satire and sincerity and come up instead with a big knotted mess. And it's always a bad sign when one of Murray's best moments is completely unrelated to the movie at hand, and plays only while the credits are rolling. \n\"Rock the Kasbah,\" an Open Road Films release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"language including sexual references, some drug use and brief violence.\" Running time: 100 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. \nMPAA Definition of R: Restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. \nAn earlier version of this review incorrectly gave the film's MPAA rating as PG-13. \nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ldbahr \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:42:03.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
