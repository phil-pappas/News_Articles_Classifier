Source: Supplied \nJust don’t be running late here whatever you do, because The Martian is not playing any scene-setting waiting games in its opening minutes. \nHaving only just arrived on Mars, a six-person NASA research team must beat a hasty retreat back to Earth. \nA monster squall is about to sweep the red planet. Everyone must quite literally down tools and make a run for it back to the transport capsule. Glass half-full ... Matt Damon as stranded Mars astronaut Mark Watney. Source: AP \nBy the time Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) gives the all-clear for an emergency exit launch, the head count is down to five. \nThe lowest-ranking member of the crew, botanist Mark Whitney (Matt Damon), was struck by flying debris, and is assumed to have died instantly. \nNo prizes for guessing Mark did not perish. However, let’s skip forward a bit to the make-or-break scenario which will carry The Martian to greater heights. \nFirst, the good news. Mark has the food-and-shelter thing covered. The crew’s base station is still operational. With less mouths to feed, there is almost a year’s worth of supplies to keep Mark nourished. \nThe bad news? A year’s worth of meals isn’t of much long-term use to Mark’s plight, considering no spacecraft is scheduled to reach Mars for at least another four years. \nAs for Mark raising an alarm that might alert his team to double-back and rescue him, forget about it. All communications systems are down. \nIn spite of having done the maths for the doomed equation before him, Mark decides to skew the figures in his favour. Earth to Mars ... Kristen Wiig in The Martian. Source: Supplied \nAs a glass-half-full kind of guy, our hero isn’t going to sit around and wait for a sealed fate to play itself out. \nIn his own words, any chance Mark stands of beating the odds will mean “I’m going to have to science the sh-- out of this.” \nWhich is exactly what he quickly sets out to do, starting off with an ingenious (and rather gross) method of growing his own produce, and then moving on from there. \nWhat follows is an incredibly involving (and surprisingly plausible) yarn about finding resilience, resourcefulness and humour in places and situations where none of these things should be remotely possible. Flight crew ... Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara and Aksel Hennie. Source: Supplied \nSpeaking of remotely, The Martian remains just as exciting and entertaining when it moves its storytelling focus off the surface of Mars. \nContinual crosses to NASA HQ in Houston — where a brains trust led by Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor are trying to piece together what has happened up there — move with an upbeat urgency that is disarmingly enjoyable. \nThis lightness of touch in a heavy-density situation is a weapon wielded most effectively by director Ridley Scott, a filmmaker not normally renowned for such an approach (as evidenced by his polarising previous mission into space cinema, 2012’s Prometheus).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:57:39.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
