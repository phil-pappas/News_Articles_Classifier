If you cared so much about my life and what I look like and how I got this way you would have been there to hold my hand as I disintegrated into a thousand pieces after losing not one but two children ”, she said before adding that she chooses not to be miserable but thank God for his mercies. \nThe former radio host went on to condemn fat shaming and that the likes of ‘Njoki Chege’ were taught no respect by their parents and should not hate fat people for a living. \nCaroline advised her to do soul searching and a check with Dr Frank Njenga is imperative so he can diagnose why ‘Njoki Cheges’ are such nasty human beings.

That’s my fat problem ,\" she concludes. \nWatch out Njoki Chege, you struck an ‘elephant’ nerve on this one.
