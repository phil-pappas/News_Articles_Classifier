Bhatt’s play will be on an intense love story between two culturally crossed individuals during times of hatred. ‘Milne do’ will be staged on April 24 at Shri Ram Centre here before it travels to other cities of India and Pakistan . “Laal Band” from Pakistan has composed the music and will perform live during the play . The story has been written by the writer of “Hamari Adhuri Kahani”, Suhrita. “For me, hope of peace is not just a few pictures and articles in newspapers but respecting, communicating with each other the way we are,” actor Imran Zahid, who is part of the play, said in a statement. “I think that represents how educated we are, how liberal we are, how we want to work together and create peace and harmony,” Zahid said. “We firmly believe that when everything fails to convert bitter hostile diplomatic relations between the two arch rivals, art and culture perhaps is the only genre that can do wonders,” he added. “Milne Do” will be directed by Happy Ranajit, who also directed the play, “A Straight Proposal”.
