Grateful for the honour,” she said.\nStreep shared the Silver Bear award jointly in 2003 with Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman for their performances in \"The Hours\". In 2012, the Berlinale gave her a lifetime achievement award and screened a selection of her films.\n“Meryl Streep is one of the most creative and multifaceted film artists. To mark our enthusiasm for her extraordinary talent, we awarded her the Honourary Golden Bear in 2012 for her lifetime achievement,\" Berlinale Director Dieter Kosslick said.\n\"I am very happy that she is returning to Berlin and with her artistic experience will take on the chairmanship of the International Jury.”\nThe Berlinale, one of Europe's main showcases for film, opens on February 11.\n(Reporting by Michael Roddy; Editing by Tom Heneghan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:18:26.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
