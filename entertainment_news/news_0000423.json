The two-part stage saga begins where Rowling's books ended — 19 years after the boy wizard's epic battle with evil Lord Voldemort. \nA synopsis says Harry is now an overworked civil servant in the Ministry of Magic, while his youngest son is struggling \"with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.\" \nThe play will run in two parts, intended to be seen either on the same day or on consecutive days. It previews from June 7 and opens July 30 at London's Palace Theatre. \nThe first play about the bespectacled wizard is based on a new story by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany. \nThe script is by Thorne, a stage and screen writer whose work includes vampire story \"Let the Right One In.\" The director is Tiffany, who helmed the critically lauded war play \"Black Watch\" and multiple Tony Award-winning musical \"Once.\" \nDetails of the cast have not been announced. \nTickets go on sale Wednesday to buyers who registered online and to the general public on Oct 30. Tickets for the whole two-part show range from 20 pounds ($31) to 130 pounds ($200). \nRowling's seven Harry Potter novels have sold more than 450 million copies around the world and been made into eight successful films. \nShe has long insisted there will be no new Harry Potter novels, but she has kept fans happy with spin-off works including the magical encyclopedia \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" which is set to be a film starring Eddie Redmayne.
