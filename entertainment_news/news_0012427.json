And Berkeley Breathed was worried that this was going to kill off the character in the imagination of readers. And it made him reconsider his own characters,\" Briger told host Terry Gross. \nBreathed told Briger: \n\"So this summer, just a couple months ago when \"Go Set A Watchman\" was causing an uproar, I went back to my files and I pulled an old fan letter from years ago. It says (reading) dear Mr. Breathed, this is a plea from a dotty old lady and from others not dotty at all. Please don't shut down Opus. Can't you at least give him a reprieve? Opus is simply the best comic strip there is and depriving him of life is murder - a hard word to describe an obliteration of your creation. But Opus is real. He lives. Harper Lee, Monroeville, Ala.... \n\"When I pulled that out - I hadn't seen it for 25 years. And I choked up, and I thought about the preposterously ironic impossibility of my literary heroine from my childhood demanding that I not kill one of her fictional heroes. The universe throws us some obvious little pitches sometimes, and we need to be awake enough not to let them slip by. So that night I found the blank four frames of \"Bloom County\" from years before in my files, and I sat down to draw the first one in 30 years. And I posted it on Facebook in sort of a what-the-hell moment, and that's exactly how much careful reason sober forethought went into the whole thing. And then it exploded after that.\" \nIn fact, Breathed in 2009 told a reporter the origins of Bloom County could be traced back to \"Mockingbird.\" \n\"You want to know why Bloom County was set in a rural, small-town environment? \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Maycomb, Alabama, was where I naturally dropped all of my imagination when it needed a setting. A therapist might help explain why, but there it is. I will say that Opus is really Scout from Mockingbird in many ways. He's a motherless innocent, adrift and wandering about in an adult world of confusion, betrayal, and incivility. We experience it through both their eyes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:24:23.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
