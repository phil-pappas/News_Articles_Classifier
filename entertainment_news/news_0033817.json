SHUTTERSTOCK.COM , SHUTTERSTOCK.COM Related article » If you go When : 11 a.m. - 6 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24.\nWhere : White Park, 3936 Chestnut St., Riverside.\nAdmission : $12 general admission; $5 ages 6-12; free for children 5 and under.\nInformation : ietacofest.com\nForget Taco Tuesday, the inaugural I.E. Taco Festival will celebrate Taco Saturday at White Park in downtown Riverside this weekend.\nNot only will there be an abundance of the delight that comes crunchy or soft, stuffed with different savory ingredients and pairs perfectly with beans and rice, but the event will also feature musical performances, a kid zone and beer and wine gardens.\nRadio giant iHeartMedia, which owns and operates Riverside-based 99.1 KGGI FM, is organizing the event. Rob Scorpio, vice president of programming at iHeartMedia in California, said it will be similar to another event iHeartMedia threw in May at White Park, the Inland Empire Salsa Festival. He said close to 10,000 people attended the salsa festival and is hopeful thousands will heed the taco call.\n“Who doesn’t love tacos?” Scorpio asked. “We kicked around ideas and thought this was a great way to bring the community together. There is so much good food in the area.”\nThere will be more than a dozen taco vendors in attendance, including Inland restaurants such as The Salted Pig in Riverside, and Taco Hut, which has locations in Riverside, Rancho Cucamonga and Ontario. There will also be fair-style fare including funnel cakes and kettle corn.\nIn addition to the eats, several artists will perform throughout the day, including JR Castro, D.R.A.M., Samantha J and Los 5. Winners of a singing competition will also be revealed. Scorpio said out of 30 entries, the two that were chosen will showcase their talents.\n“We want people to eat, drink, have some fun and dance,” Scorpio said.\nContact the writer: sschulte@pe.com , 951-368-9457", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://www.ietacofestival.com/", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwhqz5-b88542325z.120151019163535000gfsclt89.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwhqz5-b88542325z.120151019163535000gfsclt89.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:48:01.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
