But for Stefanie Angstadt , it's a passion. Angstadt crafts cheese by hand at her creamery, Valley Milkhouse, which operates out of the historic Covered Bridge Farm in Oley, Berks County. Her unique cheeses, which are available at the Easton Farmers Market on Saturdays, have earned her praise from Zagat's, which named her on its \"30 Under 30\" for Philadelphia 2015. The designation is for those under age 30 who are redefining the food industry. Angstadt is the subject of this week's Q&A:\nQ: Congratulations on your \"30 Under 30.\" What does this designation mean to you?\nA: To me, the designation represents the perseverance it took to start something I believe in. The group of 30 under 30 includes self-motivated individuals who are pushing the envelope in food and farming, and they are demonstrating their determination and inspiration in their current roles. It's an honor to be listed among them.\nQ: What is it about your cheese that you think earned you the designation?\nA: I believe it's the character of the cheese that earned the designation, and there are two drivers behind it. First, the cheese is a departure from streamlined, mechanized production. When I set out to start this production, I decided to make cheeses that could stand on their own. They are moldy, yeasty, blue veined, and often quite funky. In my operation, nothing is mechanized — even the stirring of the curds and the shaping of the cheese is done by hand. I use only one ingredient from one farm, and yet the milk is different every day because it's pasture based. All of these factors contribute to a product with personality that is ever-evolving. Even though the cheeses can be inconsistent in how they turn out, people seem to love even the mistakes. They turn into a conversation piece. Secondly, it's the milk. My dairy partner is Spring Creek Farms, a fifth-generation certified organic dairy that raises 100 percent grass-fed cows. The farm is at the foundation of what I do every day, and if it weren't for the quality of the milk, the cheeses wouldn't stand out the way that they do.\nQ: How did you get into making cheese?\nA: I started as a home cheesemaker. I was curious about the fermentation of milk. Most importantly though, I grew up loving good, strong cheese, and I wanted to learn how to make it.\nQ: What is it about making cheese that you enjoy so much?\nA: It's an entirely sensual craft. I use my hands to guide the production — they tell me when the curd is firm enough, when the surface of a wheel is done curing. I love the scent of the yeast starting to grow on a bloomy rind. The process involves all of the senses.\nQ: Do you have a favorite cheese that you make?\nA: It changes with the month. Right now, I am loving the clover cheese as an ingredient in soups and egg dishes. It's light, creamy, and slightly tart. It melts beautifully in soups. It's my best seller.\nQ: Why should people eat freshly made cheese as opposed to what's available at the supermarket?\nA: Take the example of a brie. This is a cheese that is aged for a week or two before it is shipped from France. Like in fruits and vegetables, it has to be sent at an immature age to withstand shipping, and the paste is also stabilized to encourage shelf life. I love a brie or camembert when in France, but it's hard to find good versions here in the U.S. On the other hand, our thistle is based on a brie recipe, but because it was produced in your region, it's ripe and full-bodied when you buy it. It didn't need preservatives or stabilizers, and it had the chance to ripen to its full maturity for optimal flavor and texture. Second, for health and conscious eating. It's all about knowing your farmer and food producers. Are they using sustainable practices? Are their cows being fed GMO grain for sheer volume production, or are they grazing on lush pastures and being rotated every eight hours for optimal nutrition? Cheesemakers at your local farmers' market are most likely delivering a healthier and more environmentally sound product.\n— Jennifer Sheehan", "external_links": ["http://bio.tribune.com/JenniferSheehan"], "published": "2015-10-25T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:37:33.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
