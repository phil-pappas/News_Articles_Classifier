He left for London this morning (Thursday) where he is having an operation later today and we are hopeful that Paul will rejoin us back here in Cardiff either tomorrow evening or on Saturday.\"\nIn some good news, Kearney added that Johnny Sexton and Keith Earls are expected to train tomorrow: \"Keith Earls first of all, he sat out training on Tuesday, basically we’re just managing his load - but he will train fully tomorrow. In relation to Johnny Sexton he did quite a bit of running yesterday and again is expected to train tomorrow. I attended the hearing with Seán on Tuesday - obviously it was a very long hearing it took the guts of seven hours to hear all of the evidence and see it through. It was a very fair process, a very thorough process. We did receive the written report on the hearing earlier today and we are reflecting on that and will have a further update tomorrow.\"\nAs for the support the Irish fans have given them throughout the tournament so far - especially during last Sunday's game - he said: \"It was incredible support, incredible volume, I don’t think anyone has ever heard Ireland’s call sung with such passion and gusto it really was spine tingling.\"\nMORE: The 10 Best Tweets During the Ireland V France Match\nMORE: Watch: Paul O'Connell's excellent burn for the Irish backs at their World Cup welcoming ceremony\nMORE: Watch: Sexton, O'Connell, and Henshaw talk about sleeping arrangements and blue movies", "external_links": ["http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/international/paul-o-connell-to-re-join-irish-squad-before-argentina-game-1.2393349"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:26:47.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
