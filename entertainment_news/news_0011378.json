The evening was a glitzy and successful affair, a local version of the Grammys. \nMichael Kermec was the driving force behind the YMAs, which handed out dozens of awards to local musicians. The winners were selected in online public voting. \nThe problem is, putting on the YMAs is a time-consuming job, and it also can be a thankless one. \nTo make sure that the second YMAs upholds the standards of the inaugural one, Kermec decided to skip this year. He is planning on having the next one in late 2016. \nThe biennial schedule will likely become permanent. Kermec said he probably will only have the YMAs every other year. \nSeveral reasons prompted the decision to postpone this year’s YMAs. The main issue was the headliner. Legendary Youngstown rock band Glass Harp was lined up to play, but then had to pull out due to a band member’s illness. \n“Instead of trying to redo everything, and stand the chance of it being nothing like last year, I pulled the plug for this year,” said Kermec. “I didn’t want to put something out there that wouldn’t be top notch.” \nKermec also had to deal with the usual headaches that come from staging an event that purports to declare who is the best in a field of entertainers. The YMAs are voted on by fans – not a panel of judges – but the results of any such voting will always leave some musicians and fans unhappy. \nThose are by no means the only headaches he dealt with, but you get the idea. \nCOMIC BOOK CONVENTION AT AKRON’S QUAKER STATION \nLawn-Con, the annual comic book show and sale presented in Youngstown by Chris Yambar, also will not be held this year. \nFor a substitute, try the fourth annual Akron Comicon, Nov. 7 and 8 at the University of Akron’s Quaker Station, 135 S. Broadway St. \nComic creators, dealers, panel presentations, workshops, a costume contest and more will be part of the weekend-long event. \nTickets are $10 for one day or $15 for both days. Children admission and parking are free. Get tickets and information at Akroncomicon.com. \nTHIS AND THAT: \nLovebettie will entertain at Hollywood Gaming Casino in Austintown on Friday, starting at 8 p.m. Of course, nobody – or almost nobody – goes to the casino to catch the band, but Lovebettie is worth it. The Pittsburgh-based act has been dubbed a Band to Watch by Rolling Stone. Fronted by stunning vocalist Alexandra Naples, Lovebettie appropriately calls its musical style “swagger rock.” Hopefully, the tiny stage at Hollywood Gaming casino is big enough for that swagger. \nAnthonie Tonnon is one of New Zealand’s top rising musical acts, and he is coming to Youngstown for a dinner show at 6:30 p.m. Saturday at Suzie’s Dogs and Drafts, downtown. Tonnon’s reputation as a lyricist and performer has recently seen him open for the likes of Okkervil River and Paul Kelly. A finalist for New Zealand’s top songwriting award, his new album, “Successor,” spent five weeks in his home country’s Top 20 albums chart. In his live performances, Tonnon uses elements of performance art and technological sleight of hand to create a surprising show. \n“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” has become a popular show in college and community theater circles in recent years. It’s a quick and breezy – not to mention hilarious and warm-hearted – musical that might remind you of your own school days. It’s also playing at two places this weekend: YSU Theater will present “Spelling Bee” at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 2:30 p.m. Sunday, at Ford Theater, inside Bliss Hall. And the new Reckless Optimist Productions of Sharon, Pa., will present it at 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday at Apollo Maennerchor, 391 S. Dock St., Sharon, Pa. The ticket price at both theaters is $20. \n“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder” comes to Cleveland’s Connor Palace from Nov. 3-15 for 16 performances. The 2014 Tony Award winner for Best Musical tells the story of Monty Navarro, a distant heir to a family fortune who sets out to jump the line of succession while juggling his mistress and his fiancee, plus the constant threat of landing behind bars. Tickets are on sale at playhousesquare.org and by phone at 216-241-6000. A free Broadway Buzz pre-show event will take place in the Idea Center at PlayhouseSquare one hour before each performance.
