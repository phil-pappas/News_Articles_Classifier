The nearly-two-minute video focuses on the theme song of the film, \"Writing's on the Wall\", while also showing James Bond's ( Daniel Craig ) relationships with two leading girls Lucia Sciarra ( Monica Bellucci ) and Madeleine Swann ( Lea Seydoux ) as he kicks off his mission. One of the scenes features the 007 agent stalking Sciarra through dark corridors while others show their steamy romance. Bond is also seen trying to seduce the new Bond Girl Swann. Those scenes may suggest that the spy agent will embark not only on a great adventure but also on an epic love story. The video also shows Sam Smith , the singer of the Bond song, along with director Sam Mendes and producer Barbara Broccoli discussing the song, which Smith dubs as \"the highlight\" of his career. \"What we kept thinking about through the whole process was what you said to me in our first meeting. Which is we want to write the greatest love song,\" the 23-year-old singer says. \"This is one of the highlights of my career. I am honored to finally announce that I will be singing the next Bond theme song. I am so excited to be a part of this iconic British legacy and join an incredible line up of some of my biggest musical inspirations. I hope you all enjoy the song as much as I enjoyed making it,\" Smith adds. In the upcoming movie, a cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre. The action movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on November 6. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Spectre News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:39:00.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
