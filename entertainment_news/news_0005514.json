Fifth-season comedy, 2 Broke Girls , which was scheduled for a midseason return, will take Angel 's slot, premiering Nov. 12. \nBroke Girls will be part of a CBS scripted lineup that replaces NFL games when the network's Thursday football schedule finishes its run in November. \nOn Nov. 5, the network's lineup will open with The Big Bang Theory and freshman Life in Pieces , which both move from Monday. They will be followed by the Season 3 premiere of Mom and a Big Bang rerun, leading into the fourth-season premiere of Elementary . On Nov. 12, Broke Girls ' Season 5 opener will fill the Big Bang rerun slot at 9:30 p.m. ET/PT. \nAngel From Hell stars Jane Lynch as Amy, a larger-than-life, booze-swilling woman who claims to be the guardian angel of Allison (Maggie Lawson), an intense, young doctor.
