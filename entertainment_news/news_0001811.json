Rosen. It’s getting a 3.81 of five stars from Goodreads.com , where some readers compare it to “Charlotte’s Web.” Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman, a friend of Sloan, voices each character in the audiobook. \nSloan will speak in the downstairs Readings Gallery at Village Books , 1200 11th St. , at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 7. \nSloan was born in Michigan and spent her childhood in Holland, Istanbul, Turkey, and in several U.S. cities. She’s worked as an advertising copywriter and has written and directed films, including “Angels in the Outfield” and “Made in America.” \nReach Robert Mittendorf at 360-756-2805 or robert.mittendorf@bellinghamherald.com .
