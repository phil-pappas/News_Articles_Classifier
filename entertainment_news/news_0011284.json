The raptress makes it clear in a tweet she has just posted that she doesn't want to take part in the project, which the British singer expects to also feature Miley Cyrus and Charli XCX . \"Please leave me out of the whole Lady Marmalade conversation,\" the Australia-born star wrote on Monday, October 12. \"I have nothing to do with ritas ideas & agree it should be left alone. Thanks.\" Please leave me out of the whole Lady Marmalade conversation. I have nothing to do with ritas ideas & agree it should be left alone. Thanks — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) October 12, 2015 \"Lady Marmalade\" was originally recorded in 1970s by Labelle for the \"Moulin Rouge\" soundtrack. In 2001, Christina Aguilera , Lil' Kim , Pink and Mya teamed up to redo the song. Earlier this week, Ora told The Sun, via NME, that doing another version of \"Lady Marmalade\" had \"always been my goal.\" She continued, \"I'm trying to round up the troops. I think it would be me, Miley [Cyrus], Charli XCX - she'd be fun - and Iggy [Azalea].\" Turns out, Azalea isn't the only one who dislikes Ora's remake idea. Numerous fans have reacted to the news negatively on Twitter. \"Please leave lady marmalade alone Rita. Let that dream go,\" one fan wrote. Another agreed, \"Hope this never makes it off the ground..none of these artist are worthy of performing such a song as Lady Marmalade.\" \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:10:31.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
