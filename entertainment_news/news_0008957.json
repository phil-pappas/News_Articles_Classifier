String Quartet program. \nMODIGLIANI STRING QUARTET ★★★★ \nCity Recital Hall, October 10 \nThe Modigliani​ String Quartet play with elegance and shaded refinement, bringing a distinctive style to the tapering of phrase, balance and the quality of sound.\nIn Haydn's String Quartet in B flat, Opus 50, No. 1, they allowed the subtlety of the composer's little joke at the start – making a theme out of one note – to make its point quietly without drawing attention.\nAdvertisement The cellist starts the work with repeated B flats in groups of four as though vamping till the others are ready. However, with characteristic wit, Haydn takes it up as a topic for group discussion and weaves it into the fabric.\nInstead of playing Beethoven's String Quartet in F minor, Opus 95, ( Serioso ) for its storminess alone, they also brought out its subdued moments, giving to the first movement a smouldering sophistication.\nThe sound was never harsh and the slow movement captured a mood of restrained poise, the small fugue which led off the second idea.\nThe third movement rejoiced in rhythmic ambiguity while the agitated and sinewy phrases of the last moved with smooth buoyancy.\nHowever, perhaps the highlight of the concert was Schubert's String Quartet in E flat, Opus 125.\nAgain the first movement started with restraint and a focus on quiet eloquence.\nIf there was one moment in the concert that embodied what was special about the quartet's sound, one might point to the clean, transparent sonority of the chords at the start of the slow movement.\nInscrutable balance, unforced and unmannered tonal smoothness and subtly astringent individuality of the four fine old instruments they played created a satisfying mixture of sweetness, clarity and substance.\nThe other work on the program was originally to have been the String Quartet No. 2 by Australian composer Nigel Westlake \nHowever, injury forced the quartet's usual cellist to withdraw – to be replaced by Christophe Morin​ who played Haydn's B flats so insouciantly – and the inclusion of Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 1 in C major, Opus 49 instead.\nThe work progressed from its discreet gentle opening to concise effective close without angst or sarcasm, even though it was composed just after the brutal, critical assault mounted on the composer over his opera,  Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk .\nThe quartet's playing was stylish but not faddish, infused with fine shades and ineffable sophistication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:43:40.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
