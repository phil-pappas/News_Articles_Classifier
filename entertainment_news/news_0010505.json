Here are 5 more celebrities sticking to their trademark look. 1. Rod Stewart. Rod Stewart (AP; Richard Shotwell/Invision) \nOK, so maybe he’s trimmed around the back a little bit. But the rocker found a gravity-defying hairstyle he liked – and then stuck with it for good. 2. Joan Collins. Joan Collins (AP; Ian West/PA) \nJoan has taken an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach to her hair.

Gene Simmons (Chris Martinez/AP; Paul A Hebert/Invision) \nThe bass guitarist and Kiss singer has been sporting the same helmet of hair since his early Kiss days. To perform as The Demon, he paints his face and puts in a little top-knot, but in his down-time he lets it hang free and fuzzy. 4. Dawn French. Dawn French (Fiona Hanson/PA; Ian West/PA) \nAside from going for a blunter cut, Dawn has retained her bob and fringe and side-parting since the “dawn” of her career. 5. Brian May.
