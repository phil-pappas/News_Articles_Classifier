Well that and Colin Farrell on The Late Late Show. It kicks off at 8pm with The Last Leg in which Adam Hills and co-hosts Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker tear into the week's main talking points while raising awareness of SU2C and the life-changing work of Cancer Research UK.\nIt will then be followed by Celebrity Gogglebox. Yep, you can watch the celebs watching TV and be like, regular people. T'will be mad craic altogether. The celebs include Geri Halliwell, Boy George, Marilyn, Miranda Hart, Nick Frost, Lee Mack, and JAMIE DORNAN! Sorry, we should have opened on that really.\nLater on then Alan Carr will continue the night with more fun and festivities as he is joined by fellow chat show host Jonathan Ross, Great British Bake Off co-host Sue Perkins and This Is England '90 star Thomas Turgoose, who returns to honour his bet from an earlier show to have Alan's name tattooed on his bottom if Â£5,000 can be raised for SU2C. Plus, 5 Seconds of Summer perform their single Hey Everybody!\nSo a great night of entertainment and all for an exceptionally good cause too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:57:59.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
