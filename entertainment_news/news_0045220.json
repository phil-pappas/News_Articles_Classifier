For the first time, the Thomaston gallery is remaining open during the fall months with a selection of portraits, still lifes, landscapes and sculptures from many gallery favorites including Roger Dale Brown and Vincent Giarrano. Through December, the gallery is open to visitors Thursdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. \nAfter such a well-attended summer season that saw Mainers and visitors from all over the country stopping by, Haynes Galleries is keeping several of its most popular pieces in Thomaston for the next few months. Brown’s landscapes, many of which are of scenic spots all over Maine, preside over space on the first floor of the gallery. Giarrano’s paintings, which were featured during a solo exhibition at the beginning of the summer, invite viewers to contemplate private moments in more urban, public spaces. Fans of Haynes’ diverse realist collections will find groupings of works by some of the gallery’s most distinguished artists including Burton Silverman, Seth Haverkamp and Nancy Depew. \nFor more information, visit haynesgalleries.com or email garyhaynes@haynesgalleries.com. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
