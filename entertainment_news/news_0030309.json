Remember how Ranbir would save his girlfriends' numbers as 'Battery low'? Or against the name of guys, just in case his mobile rang when he was with one of his girlfriends.\n\nAlia Bhatt and Shahid Kapoor \nRK had admitted to it on Karan Johar's chat show, 'Koffee With Karan', in 2010. Now, Alia seems to be doing something similar when it comes to saving the number of rumoured 'good friend' Sidharth Malhotra. She saves his number as Sid â€” Marketing.\nThis nugget came from Shahid Kapoor , Alia's co-star in her upcoming film, 'Shaandaar'. During a recent promotional event, Sasha spilled the beans about how Alia is always on the phone with a certain 'Sid from Marketing'. With Sidharth shooting for 'Baar Baar Dekho' in England, Alia seems to be constantly on the line with him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:37:57.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
