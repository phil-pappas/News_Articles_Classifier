Even today music remains her prime calling; but there are other things that the 32-year-old songstress is equally passionate about.\nShe recently represented India at the 2015 Global Citizen Festival in New York, where she took centre stage alongside internationally-renowned talent like Coldplay , Pearl Jam , Beyonce and others. What has stayed with her is their single-mindedness and devotion to give to the underprivileged and their noble attempts to save the globe. Excerpts from a conversation with Sunidhi...\nWould you say that participating in the 2015 Global Citizen Festival has been a life-changing experience?\nIt may be a bit dramatic to call it life changing. But I've come back charged. I no longer wish to be a bystander and watch the world go by. I definitely want to do my bit to change lives, in whatever little way I can. The experience of the global concert was unimaginable. So many people came forward and spoke in one voice to support the various issues that are currently plaguing our world. We had around 65,000 people at Central Park, New York. I was so happy to be associated with such a thing. The causes addressed were women's education, sanitation, saving the environment, giving back to society and much more. People were just joining the concert online and soon it became a movement. It was very exciting. I was happy to be representing India.\nREAD: Sunidhi Chauhan: Things you may not know about the singer\nWhat songs did you sing on the occasion?\nI sang songs that I thought were perfect for the occasion. I started with ' Be Intehaan' ( Race 2 ), then ' Sajna Ve Sajna' ( Chameli) and ' Kamli' ( Dhoom 3 ) . There was a little flavour of Punjab and the right mix of Bollywood. However, this platform was not just about our songs, it was about the causes this movement was supporting.\nWhat was the green room conversation with Chris Martin , Freida Pinto and other artistes like?\nBelieve me, even the green room conversation was about how to eradicate world poverty, educate women, save the planet and such other stuff. Every single person present vowed not to be a bystander but to be a part of the movement and do our bit to better the world. For me, the cause was the hero of the trip.\nDo you recall how the whole thing started?\nFor me, it started with a phone call from Chris Martin. I was ecstatic that Chris contacted me but I was even happier that he asked me to participate in this noble cause. I did not realise the gravity of it till I actually went to Central Park that day. For instance, when I heard that 62 million girls across the globe do not have access to education, I was really sad. I was moved as a artiste and as a human being. The whole thing just stayed with me. In my own little way I want to make a difference. I wish to do my bit for the causes and that is my immediate goal. While my profession makes me a singer and entertainer, I want to be someone who people can look up to.\nYou have been singing for two decades now. Does music still hold the same magic for you that it did when you started out?\nI've always been a girl on the move. I've sung as many as six songs a year. I'm a singer, I hope to remain one forever and I love music. It doesn't matter to me if it's a small or a big film. If I like the song, I will sing. The only reason I record a lot less these days is because I don't want to repeat myself. I need to be able to look at myself in the mirror and feel happy. I've done every kind of song that Bollywood asked for. Now, I just pass on the songs that I feel can be sung by someone else\n.\nWhy would you do something like that?\nWhy not? There is a lot of young talent out there. Like I said, I do not wish to become repetitive. An artiste has to be able to constantly grow. When I was at the Global Citizen Festival, something changed within me. As a human being and a citizen of India, I found myself thinking more deeply. As I said earlier, you cannot take singing away from me. But my songs are not the only thing I wish to be remembered for.\nThe Western world gives more importance to their singers and bands, than they do to their film stars. But in India, it's vice versa. Did you notice this?\nI don't think the craze is less for actors or more for singers. It's just that they can't help but respect an artiste. I saw it backstage this time and I've noticed it earlier too. The whole of Hollywood was backstage and I saw them interacting with each other. I saw singers, bands and stars giving each other equal amount of importance.\nOne hears that the Global Citizen Festival is likely to happen in India next year.\nYes, it's going to happen in Delhi next year, around the same time as it did this year. We will have so many internationally-renowned artistes coming to India and speaking about the causes this body supports. We will spread the word among the masses and hope it has the maximum reach. Chris Martin's target is to end poverty by 2030, but I'm hoping that we achieve results even sooner. And I believe this can happen if we all stay focussed. I want to thank Hugh Evans, Co-Founder and CEO at Global Citizen, for feeling so strongly about these issues and spreading the word and taking action towards the same.\nWhat are the issues you feel strongly about?\nI do not know where to begin. Frankly, I'm so happy that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. I'm now urging people to not just be bystanders but to participate actively in making our surroundings better. Gender equality, women's safety, education for the underprivileged, toilets, sanitation, global warming... there were so many issues addressed by the gathering in New York for seven hours. I'm going to put this into action. I hope the citizens of India who're reading this piece will take part. I want to urge people not to litter and to be kind to senior citizens. I want the administration to improve infrastructure and give better amenities to the elderly. I wish to bring focus on separate lanes for ambulances. People in this city lose their lives while travelling because of traffic jams and an ambulance is not made available to them on time. Someone is dying in front of you and you just watch it happen. I have seen some disturbing videos online. Humanity has disappeared from our lives. We must also introduce sex education in schools. Though in India we're conservative, we need to address certain issues in a more practical way. We must educate our children so that they grow up with enlightened minds. Nudity should not be a taboo topic. A more direct approach will help. The global concert actually gave me an incentive to step on it. We cannot just sit back and watch. We need to be the change.\nMany singers have ventured into acting. Would you, too, consider a switch?\nI may consider it if I like a script and get a good role. Life is about doing everything. So I think if something interests me and I feel that I'll be able to do a decent job, I'll try. I'm sure I won't be that bad. I definitely don't want to make a fool of myself. If I do it, I'll put my heart and soul into it.\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nWould you say the songs in Bollywood are different now?\nThe songs and lyrics have changed. The writing has become more casual. It's not just about the romance or situations; it's more fun and different. I don't want to gauge from what's happening. There are great songs that keep coming in but then there are some average songs, too. Change is something which is constant so the sound has changed. Tunes are simpler and songs are shorter now. There aren't two antaras anymore - it's just a verse and a bridge. At times, a mukhda is just a beat. It's repeated once more and the song is ready. There are a lot of people who are working in different styles. Everybody has their own sur and it is working with the audience, so it's good. I'm just happy to be a part of this change. We shouldn't be cribbing, but be able to adapt to it. Not like sitting there and saying, \" Arre , pehle aisa, ab aisa' . I want to keep that aside and keep my mind and soul happy. There's much more to do in life. I've a personal life too.\nWhat is a typical day in your life?\nThe beauty of my life is that there is no typical day. What I like about it is that it's not predictable. Thankfully, I've managed a near-perfect balance between my personal and professional life. I am doing the best of TV shows, stage concerts and Bollywood songs. The last kick-ass song I did was ' Girls Like To Swing' from Dil Dhadakne Do . Then I did ' Move On' from Tanu Weds Manu Returns, which was a rage. I also did the title track for Piku . Besides the item songs that come to me, I've also been getting some interesting feel-good songs. However, I must confess I enjoy singing the item songs too.\n Music news and pictures Music updates\nListen to songs of Sunidhi Chauhan on Gaana.com\nWATCH: Sunidhi Chauhan Wins Dadasaheb Phalke Academy Award for ' Kamli '", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qz6R9wA3Y2Q", "http://gaana.com/artist/sunidhi-chauhan", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:55:29.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
