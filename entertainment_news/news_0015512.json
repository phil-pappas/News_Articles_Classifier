The common solutions tend to involve tutoring, mentoring, workforce training and early childhood reading as priority initiatives. This focus on “re” education reinforces what the data show, namely that our city school district has for decades failed to educate the city’s youth. But what is curious is that these groups, whether Roc the Future, the United Way or even the Anti-Poverty Task Force only ever call for incremental fixes to the system without advocating for holistic structural reform. There seems to be some unwritten rule that resigns all to accept the failed city school system as an unchangeable given, even when the city school performance, in the words of Governor Cuomo, “could not be any worse.” There is an elephant in the room muting the voices of reform and all signs point to the immense money and power derived from a school budget closing in on a billion dollars as that elephant. The pot of money allotted to the city school district in a state that is tops in per-pupil spending is undoubtedly the envy of the rest of the country and it funds much more than just teacher and administrator salaries. Unlike the suburban counterparts, the elected school board members have their own income line item and teacher unions are a significant downstream recipient which allows them to fund the re-election campaigns of friendly legislators. The elephant is not just created by the school budget however, as the countless number of agencies serving the uneducated poor receive funding that is proportional to degree of poverty and homelessness, which of course is in large part fueled by a failed educational system. In short, the “system” that guarantees a paycheck for many in Rochester is protected by those that share in its largesse.\nInstead of radical reform, nibbling at the edges of the problem has become a much safer alternative. Although some vigorously defend the school system due to an ideological belief that government sanctioned educational monopolies are the “American way”, the self-interest motive seems to be the most plausible reason why legislators Morelle and Robach for instance ignore systemic reform as they like many office holders rely on teacher union money to get elected. In the upcoming State of Our Children address, a collaboration of Roc the Future, the United Way, the Community Foundation, the city school Superintendent and others, a 60-page Center for Governmental Research study on poverty to be featured literally has just one paragraph devoted to education reform. My guess is that this event will allot little or no time to the results differential between local charter schools and the city school system and the focus will be on newly-announced plans for more of the same incremental change, even though Rochester is 90th out of the largest 90 cities in city school performance. In contrast, there have been hundreds and even thousands of philanthropists in the Rochester community taking bold steps to make a difference by supporting alternatives from private schools to charter schools, alternatives that are achieving real and tangible success.\nThe next time you read about the re-educational initiatives like tutoring and mentoring, stamp in your mind the proverbial rearranging of deck chairs on the Titanic as without wholesale change, these ancillary feel-good policies will only ever skim the edges of reform. If our collective goal is to save the children of our city, then we all must first understand and recognize the need to disregard if not eliminate the elephant in the room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:54.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
