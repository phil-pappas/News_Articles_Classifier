The video highlights Bobby Cannavale 's Richie Finestra, a record label president whose ambition is to make great music that makes \"the hair on the back of your neck stand up.\" Scenes showing fan hysteria, the rock stars' wild night life, drugs and gunshot are also previewed while The Stooges' \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" is played in the video. \"This is the sound of revolution,\" reads a tagline in the promo video. Set in 1970s New York, the drama will present a ride through the sex- and drug-addled music business at the dawn of punk, disco and hip-hop, seen through the eyes of Richie Finestra, who is trying to save his company and his soul without destroying everyone in his path. Scorsese directed the pilot in addition to serving as executive producer along with Mick Jagger and Terence Winter. It also stars Olivia Wilde as Richie's former actress/model wife Devon, Ray Romano as Zak Yankovich, the Head of Promotions for the label, and Juno Temple as Jamie Vine, an ambitious assistant in the A&R department with aspirations of breaking through the glass ceiling. Jagger's son, James Jagger, plays the lead singer of an early punk rock band called the Nasty Bits. The new series is slated to premiere in January 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Vinyl News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:33:22.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
