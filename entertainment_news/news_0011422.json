Federal St., downtown, in the DeYor Performing Arts Center. \nThe Sunday Serenade concert will feature the music of Mozart, Dvorak, Elgar and Tchaikovsky. Tickets can be purchased by calling the box office at 330-744-0264 or online at youngstownsymphony.com. \nSerenades, or evening songs, were characteristically simple, melodic and sensuous compositions conceived to be played as garden or al fresco music. \nThe selections to be performed on Sunday’s program span a 109-year period and represent some of the best-known music of this genre. \nMozart’s popular 1787 Serenade in G Major, also known as “Eine kleine Nachtmusik,” will begin the program. Also on the bill are Dvorak’s Serenade for Strings in E Major, which premiered in 1876; Elgar’s Serenade for Strings from 1896; and Tchaikovsky’s Serenade, which premiered in 1881. \nPatrons are invited for a special Sunday Serenade brunch at noon at the Overture Restaurant, inside the DeYor Performing Arts Center, prior to the concert. Brunch reservations are required. Call 330-744-9900.
