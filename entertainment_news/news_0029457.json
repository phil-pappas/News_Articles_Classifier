According to the pro-Kremlin daily, the musician wrote a letter suggesting that if he were granted a Russian passport he would be able to live in Crimea for six months at a time. There he would shoot movies and television shows that would push Russia to a \"high level in this business.\" \nDurst ly wrote that he wanted to be a part \"of the great future of Crimea and Russia\" and guaranteed that \"other creative Americans from film and show business\" would follow him to Russia. \nLimp Bizkit reached its peak of popularity in the West in the early 2000s, but Durst and his band appear to enjoy a large following among Russians -- and even the Russian government. \nIn his recent letter to the Crimean authorities, Durst ly made clear his fondness for the Russian president. \n\"I think that President Putin will understand what kind of person I am, having looked into my eyes ,and will know that he has an ally that can help in many things,\" Durst wrote, according to . \"I am sure that we can do many important things together and it will help Russia, and it will help people all around the world to understand that Putin is a great guy with clear moral principles and a nice person.\" \nPerhaps Durst sees someone in Putin -- something he often sings about on stage in Limp Bizkit's cover of The Who hit : \nNo one knows what it's like \nTo be the bad man \nTo be the sad man \nBehind blue eyes \nWhat it's like to be hated \nTo be fated to telling only lies \nOr not. Whatever the case, Russian officials in Crimea appear anxious to hear from Durst to further discuss the possibility of cooperation. \n\"All the proposals that he puts forward, I am sure, will be met with enthusiasm in Crimea,\" Sergei Strelbitsky, Crimea's so-called minister of resorts and tourism, told .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:24:21.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
