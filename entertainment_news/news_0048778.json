The \"DWTS\" judge doesn't think it would be fair to the other contestants if the Bravo reality star is back on the show. \"I always love somebody who doesn't give up, okay. I think that that's a wonderful spirit to have. You should never give up. However ... our rules say that she has to be out,\" she told PEOPLE at PETA's 35th Anniversary Gala in Los Angeles. \"I think that it would be unfair to the other competitors if she came back because she did not compete.\" \"She got a week to rest and our show is tough,\" the female judge added. \"Having a week to rest could make a huge difference in the future of her competition, so I kind of think that it's okay the way it is. I wish her well, though. I'm very glad to hear that she's doing well health-wise.\" Kym Johnson, the pro dancer who co-hosted the show last week, seemed to agree with Inaba. \"The rules are the rules and it was really unfortunate what happened,\" she said. \"I think her health has to take priority and you know that's the rules. ... I feel bad for Tony, poor thing. But I think it wouldn't be fair to the other couples then as well that were there and could actually dance.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More Dancing with the Stars News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:37:58.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
