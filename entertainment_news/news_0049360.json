This year’s prize pool exceeds $62m.\nThe Vegas chess contests will be live-streamed with dramatic music, graphics and commentators to explain what is happening and convey suspense. A computer programme called Deep View will use algorithmic tools to visualise and explain match dynamics. It will also detect unusual and interesting matches among hundreds taking place simultaneously.\nAbout 600 players have each paid a $1,000 entry fee to compete in nine different divisions, each with prizes totalling $1m, including a $100,000 pot for first place in a division open to all.\nIn a twist from last year, this tournament will also pit the nine division winners against each other in a game-show-style contest. The winner will get to choose one envelope from 64 placed on squares of a giant chessboard. One of the envelopes will contain a $1m prize. “If they pick it they’ll become a millionaire at that moment,” said Ashley.\nTen of the US’s top 12 players have registered, including Hikaru Nakamura, currently the world No 2, so organisers are billing the tournament as “USA versus the world”. The Americans will be up against Russia’s Evgeny Bareev and China’s Yu Yangyi – but not Norway’s Magnus Carlsen, the reigning world champion, who is not attending.\nAshley, who was born in Jamaica, made his first foray into tournament organising with the HB Global Challenge in Minneapolis in 2005, which offered $500,000 in prizes, the then record.\nThis year’s tournament will have more contestants than last year’s but will, again, lack live television coverage, which means another financial loss for organisers. They hope that will change next year.\n“Our model is based on TV and sponsorship. At the moment TV executives are not convinced it’ll make good television,” said Ashley. “The real win will be when it hits TV. Hopefully we can weather the storm until then.”\nTransforming the image of a 1,500-year-old board game that tends to be sedentary, static and silent will be a challenge. Some players exhibit flair, aggression and killer instinct on the board but show few emotions off it , barely smiling, let alone whooping and punching the air, after victory.\nOn the upside, chess attracts youth – many top grandmasters, including Carlsen and Nakamura, are in their 20s – and Hollywood just released a biopic, Pawn Sacrifice , in which Tobey Maguire plays chess legend Bobby Fischer.\n“It’s slow, four or five hours to play one game, so it may not have the same appeal as poker,” said Frank Guadalupe, events director of the US chess federation, who will act as the tournament’s chief arbiter.\nBut enthusiasm in schools, clubs and elsewhere suggested potential for a much higher profile if effectively marketed, he said. “I think the traction could be much bigger than people realise. This event will make people realise that chess is more than two old guys playing in a coffee shop.”\nThis article was written by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles, for theguardian.com on Wednesday 7th October 2015 12.00 Europe/London guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/10/pawn-sacrifice-review-tobey-maguire-toronto-film-festival", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://gu.com/p/4d3z9", "http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/03/01/poweredbyguardian.png", "http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chess", "https://millionairechess.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dhome&mob=js&c=", "http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29573719"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:48:38.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
