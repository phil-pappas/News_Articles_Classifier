The episode may have left viewers, particularly fans of Glenn ( Steven Yeun ), sobbing over the fate of the major character who has appeared since the first season. In the said episode titled \"Thank You\", [SPOILER ALERT!] Glenn and Nicholas (Michael Traynor) were trapped on a dumpster with a herd of walkers around them. Nicholas said to Glenn, \"Thank you,\" before he shot himself in the head and both of them fell onto the ground. As the walkers appeared to be feasting on Nicholas' dead body, Glenn looked up in horror. It's not clear if Glenn would survive this, but the fan-favorite character did die in the comic books although not in the aforementioned manner. While viewers have to wait until next week to find out the answer, showrunner Scott Gimple promised that it wasn't the last they saw of Glenn. In a statement for \"Talking Dead\", he wrote, \"Dear fans of 'The Walking Dead', this is a hard story to tell, and when we were planning to tell it, we knew our friends over at 'Talking Dead' would be talking to you about it, and knowing you'd talking and feeling and commiserating, I knew we should say something about it, lest our silence say something we didn't mean to say or not say so I will say this. In some way, we will see Glenn, some version of Glenn or parts Glenn again, either in flashback, or current story, to help complete the story.\" While Gimple was coy when addressing Glenn's fate, The Spoiling Dead Fans has provided an evidence which confirms that the character is still alive on the show. The group recently obtained a picture that shows the actor, Yeun, on the set filming for future episode of the hit series. \"The Walking Dead\" returns with \"Here's Not Here\" on Sunday, November 1 at 9/8c on AMC. In the episode, a new face appears, and trust issues form. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:01:02.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
