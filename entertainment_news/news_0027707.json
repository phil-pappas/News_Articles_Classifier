Am I crazy to expect him to stay clothed in semi-public? If this is what has been happening, it appears you have married an exhibitionist who could be arrested for indecent exposure if a neighbor chooses to complain. If this is what’s happening, you’re not crazy; you are a concerned wife. [...] some of the items for sale are unhealthy or not things we’d use, so it seems wrong to ask others to buy them. Instead of selling, where they only get a small portion of the funds, I’d rather donate directly to the school. When a new fundraiser is announced, should I ask the teacher or PTA member how much our share is and then write a check? I’m afraid I’d be inviting gossip about being too stuck up or wealthy to participate (we are neither). [...] how do I explain to my 7-year-old why I don’t think she should be selling things, without seeming critical of her friends who are? If you prefer to donate the money you would be expected to raise, rather than have your child solicit door-to-door, your wishes should be respected because the result will be the same for her school.
