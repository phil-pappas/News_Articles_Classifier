She's certainly taken her time about it: Katona's five children range in age from the newest at 17 months to her eldest daughter, now 14, but if there is the remotest grain of truth in this stereotypical statement of agent-drafted drivel suggesting she'll finally be putting the kids first, it can't come soon enough. \nOnce quite famous for singing cheesy pop songs and eating bugs on ITV reality shows, in recent years, Katona's name only appears in headlines preceding yet another report of her life falling to pieces. Related content Mary O'Leary: Bullying charities, stressed-out mothers and spiders \nDrug abuse, chaotic relationships and cringe-worthy TV appearances weren't masked by the odd glossy magazine cover professing a covetable lifestyle: can there be a more shameful addition to the CV than being fired as the face of Iceland? \nAnd throughout it all were the children, dragged from one new home to the next as their mother jumped from terrible boyfriend to even worse husband. \nI don't doubt Katona's heart was broken badly when her marriage to the chubby one from Westlife dissolved, and her subsequent partner picks speak of a derailed soul searching for a mate at any cost. \nThere was Mark Croft, who Katona met when he allegedly tried to supply drugs to her mother and she still decided to marry, having two children with him in between the cocaine abuse that followed. \nAnd then there was third husband George Kay, a former rugby league player who Katona married a year after he was released from prison for blackmail, and despite his having been detained under the Mental Health Act shortly before the wedding after suffering a public meltdown. \nThe signs were there from the start, in other words. \nBut our Jungle Queen pressed on anyway, stuffing the children into fresh bridesmaids' dresses and pageboy outfits and pledging her troth to another blatantly unsuitable partner regardless. Not quite so much \"focusing on the children\" happening in those days. \nDon't be fooled into thinking this is solely the behaviour of a random D-list celeb either; Katona is simply an extreme example of a common trend. Leaping in to new relationships with little thought for the implications on children caught up along the way, and signing the marriage register to clearly damaged souls not up to the role of a step-parent. \nMarriages fall apart, relationships end, and these days, families are created from all sorts of components, often to great success and lasting happiness: I don't mean to suggest otherwise. \nI'm just increasingly weary of witnessing single parents – of both sexes – so focused on locking down the next mate that they get caught up in relationships with blatantly unsuitable partners rather than putting the kids first, or even second. \nIt'd be worrying to think Katona was viewed as an act to follow by anyone, but such publicly prominent examples in the public eye certainly reinforce the misguided belief that this is acceptable behaviour, rather than the depressingly deplorable state of affairs it actually is. \nStar baker's food for the soul \nI cosied up for the winter over cakes made by someone else involving far less effort expended by me, and showcased in that glorious soft focus panning of the sort the BBC does so well; farewell, Great British Bake Off, my Wednesday evenings have been much satisfied by your presence. \nThis year's winner Nadiya was lovely to watch, the final emotional, and each episode a rare burst of gentle joy in a TV schedule otherwise dominated by dross. \nPlease don't leave me alone with nothing but The X-Factor to see me through til spring. \nApprentices carry hopes of Plymouth's TV redemption \nMy much-bewailed complaint that no decent Westcountry folk dominate the overwhelming array of reality TV shows saturating our screens was barely appeased by the pie-eating Plymothian who popped up on Big Brother this summer only to showcase the lower end of the spectrum populating the city, and demonstrate why watching Plymouth Argyle is better done without a piece of pastry permanently clutched in one hand. \nBut ahoy, here comes the next series of The Apprentice, and what's this? Lord Sugar of the boardroom of doom has picked not one but two Janners for the firing line: my excitement knows no bounds. \nEspecially as this pair of proper Plymothians look like they might represent my home town in a less shameful fashion. \nDon't let me down, Charliene Wain and Brett Butler-Smythe; I have high hopes for the pair of you with your sold business backgrounds, reliably efficient Naval training and respectably smart promo photos. \nLet's put Plymouth on the map for entrepreneurial glory rather than our skills at eating the contents of a Greggs' counter in one sitting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:26:32.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
