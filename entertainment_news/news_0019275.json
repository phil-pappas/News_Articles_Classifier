The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the SAFE Act in New York and laws in Connecticut following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 do not infringe on the Second Amendment, as gun-rights groups contended.\n\"We hold that the core provisions of the New York and Connecticut laws prohibiting possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large‐capacity magazines do not violate the Second Amendment, and that the challenged individual provisions are not void for vagueness, the court ruling states.\nThe court, however, found New York's requirement that only seven bullets can be loaded into a 10-round magazine is unconstitutional, upholding previous court ruling . In response to the earlier ruling, New York has already agreed to not enforce the seven-bullet limit.\nIn Connecticut, the court ruled against a provision that prohibits the ownership of a non‐semiautomatic Remington 7615.\nThe judges said that the seven-round limit would be difficult to enforce, citing how most manufacturers do not make guns that only seven rounds.\n\"New York has failed to present evidence that the mere existence of this load limit will convince any would‐be malefactors to load magazines capable of\nholding ten rounds with only the permissible seven,\" the ruling states.\nGun-rights groups knocked the decision.\n“The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision released Monday on the 'NY UNSAFE Act' is both disappointing and expected given the politicized nature of the issue,\" Jake Palmateer, who heads the group, NY2A, said in a statement.\n\"Just as no American citizen should face felony prosecution in one state for what is seen as free speech in another state, no American citizen should be denied their Second Amendment rights just because they live in New York or Connecticut.\"\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman, who represented New York in the case, hailed the ruling.\n“I am very pleased that the court upheld almost every aspect of the law,\" he said in a statement. \"Now that the court has ruled, it is time for everyone involved in the critical debate about how to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous and unstable people to come together to work toward sensible solutions that will keep our communities safe.”\nNYSRAP-vs-Cuomo-OPINION-10192015.pdf by jspector\n>\n(AP Photo)", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/doc/285910758/Shew-v-Malloy-207-1-Opinion-CCDL", "https://www.scribd.com/jspector", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/285917369/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-VJSIRsuUNazoRjj6WPOZ&show_recommendations=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:58:05.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
