(Jerod Harris / Getty Images) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nQuentin Tarantino is courting controversy once again, with his less-than-favorable views on \"Selma\" and comments saying he was persecuted for his skin color in \"Django Unchained\" criticisms. \nIn an interview with Bret Easton Ellis for T Magazine , Tarantino revealed his opinion of Ava DuVernay's \"Selma,\" which was largely left out of last year's Oscar race, leading many criticize the Academy for its exclusion. While it was nominated for best picture, it was left out of the acting and directing categories. \n\"She did a really good job on 'Selma' but 'Selma' deserved an Emmy,\" he said to the \"American Psycho\" author. \nThe two then moved on to some of the backlash the director received in 2012 following the release of \"Django Unchained.\" Tarantino was panned by some black writers and filmmakers who believed he diminished the experience of slavery. He felt that these criticisms came from him being a white man. \n\"When the black critics came out with savage think pieces about 'Django,' I couldn't have cared less. If people don't like my movies, they don't like my movies, and if they don't get it, it doesn't matter,\" Tarantino said. \"The bad taste that was left in my mouth had to do with this: It's been a long time since the subject of a writer's skin was mentioned as often as mine. You wouldn't think the color of a writer's skin should have any effect on the words themselves. In a lot of the more ugly pieces my motives were really brought to bear in the most negative way. It's like I'm some supervillain coming up with this stuff.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:12:41.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
