She also has written three plays and the screenplays for 21 documentary films. The Swedish Academy cited Alexievich \"for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.\"\nThe academy's permanent secretary, Sara Danius, told that Swedish broadcaster SVT that she reached the writer just before the announcement.\n\"She said one word: 'Fantastic!'\" Danius said.\nShe praised Alexievich as a great and innovative writer.\n\"She transcends the format of journalism and has developed a new literary genre that bears her trademark,\" Danius said.\nThe daughter of two village schoolteachers, Alexievich studied journalism in Belarus, which at the time was part of the Soviet Union. She now lives in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and like many intellectuals supports the political opponents of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who is up for re-election on Sunday.\nLast year's literature award went to French writer Patrick Modiano.\nThis year's Nobel announcements continue with the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday and the economics award on Monday. All awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:46:08.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
