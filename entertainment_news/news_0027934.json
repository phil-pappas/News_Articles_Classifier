The Titanic lunch menu sold for $88,000 and the Titanic ticket for $11,000! Thanks to everyone who participated!!!\" Lion Heart Autographs said on its Facebook page.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731808&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731808", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1731808&h=The+Titanic%27s+last+lunch+menu+sells+for+%2488%2C000"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:35:01.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
