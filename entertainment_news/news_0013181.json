Comics, Cosplay & Games Comments \nIf comic books and their surrounding culture were currency, they would be gold right about now. \nNo matter the season, you can see a freshly-adapted tale on the silver and smaller screens. And conventions, or comic cons, celebrating the art, characters and entertainment from these pulpy graphic novels are popping up everywhere. \nGetting in on the action this year is Lafayette. The small city will host Louisiana Comic Con this weekend at the Cajundome, 444 Cajundome Blvd. The convention will be open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are $15 per day, or $25 for a weekend pass. Tickets for children ages 8 and under are $5. \nThis weekend’s festival includes appearances from actors Sean Gunn (“Guardians of the Galaxy,”“Super,”), Lew Temple (“The Walking Dead,”“The Devil’s Rejects”) and Baton Rouge native Pruitt Taylor Vince (“The Walking Dead,”“Constantine”). Artists such as Joe Rubinstein (“Wolverine”) and Andy Kuhn (“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,”“Doctor Who”) will also be there. \nEven some Lafayette talents, including Rob Guillory (the Eisner/Harvey award-winning artist behind “Chew”) and writer/artist Kody Chamberlain (“Punks,”“Sweets”), will be on hand. \nPanels featuring the talent will be held throughout Saturday and Sunday in two rooms. The event will also feature a wide selection of tabletop games, available to play for free in a gaming area. \nFor more information, visit louisianacomiccon.com . \nFollow Matthew Sigur on Twitter @MatthewSigur .
