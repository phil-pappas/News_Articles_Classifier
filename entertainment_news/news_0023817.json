We didn't know anything about it. We talked to him, (and) he literally contributed his entire staff to try to help us with bills at the Legislature. None of the results would have given him a direct benefit. It would just allow us to create a film studio,\" said Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa . \n \n\nSOURCE Relativity Media LLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:18:17.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
