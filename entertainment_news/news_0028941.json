They have the wonderful rapport we all expect of Gomez and Morticia Addams. He swoons as she remains cool and collected. The chemistry is strong. \nDavid Girolmo, a Fulton regular and always fun to watch, is Uncle Fester, the romantic Addams Family member. Girolmo is charming and does what he can with the role, that includes singing a love song to the moon (“The Moon and Me”), which is just odd. \nCary Michelle Miller is Wednesday, who is now 18 and has fallen in love with a regular guy named Lucas (Andras Lincoln), much to the chagrin of Morticia. \nShe has a few vestiges of the Wednesday of old, but is more complicated and interested in the outside world. Normally, this would be a good thing but one of the joys of the Addams Family is how uncomplicated they are. And the creators of the show don’t give Wednesday enough of an edge. Miller, though, is just fine and boy can she sing! \nLiam Keenan is Pugsley who doesn’t understand why his sister Wednesday doesn’t want to torture him anymore. He wants to give Wednesday a potion to make her change her mind, but things don’t work out that way. That plot twist is tepid. \nCharis Leos steals the show every time she is on stage. She’s Grandmama, who is a cross section of a crazy lady, ex-hippie and witch (a nice one, though) and she’s got some of the best lines in the show. \nMal and Alice, Lucas’ mother and father, who are invited to dinner with the Addams Family, are played with great fun by Tony Lawson and Heidi Kettenring. \nAnd rounding out the cast is Brian Martin as Lurch, whose presence is what his whole character is about. \nSo, here is this strong cast working hard to make this show sing. The voices are all terrific and their comic timing is solid. Kudos to director Marc Robin for bringing those performances together. \nBut as strong as they are, the cast can’t make this show work all that well. The plot is mushy and kind of dumb. That perfect comic timing can’t make unfunny jokes funny (I’d say the ratio of not funny to funny is about 60/40.) \nWednesday is in love and with Lucas and she doesn’t want her dad Gomez to tell mom Morticia that they are engaged. She has invited Lucas‘s parents over for dinner and asks that the family be normal for the night. \nOf course, that is not possible. And Morticia becomes ridiculously upset that Gomez is keeping something from her. And Gomez is sad his daughter has grown up. And the Addams Family’s ancestors are roaming about the mansion waiting to return to their graves. But love has to conquer all before that can happen. \nWhy the creators of the Addams Family, including heavy hitters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice (book) and Andrew Lippa (music), decided to make this musical be super sweet and wimpy is a mystery. Yes, they have the jokes about death and how being miserable is the way to go, which usually land pretty well, but they want to relentlessly remind us that the Addams Family is as normal as any other family. And that takes away a lot of the potential fun. \nThe voices are great, but most of the songs are forgettable. Once exception was Morticia’s number, “Just Around the Corner,” about the many ways you can die, which includes a big tap number with the Ancestors. \nThat number gave a glimpse at what the Addams Family could have been. \nIf you go:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:30:31.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
