News, he said: \"I studied the divinity. I studied as a minister for nearly $35. Out of that I have a certificate that makes me available for weddings.\" \nAllison, 27, and Ricky, 34, tied the knot in front of their friends and family, including the brunette beauty's father Brian Williams, who gave her away, her co-stars Lena Dunham, Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet, Katy Perry, John Mayer, Seth Meyers and Bruce Springsteen. \nTom's wife Rita Wilson, who plays Allison's mother on the hit HBO comedy, was also in attendance. \nThe couple were keen to keep their wedding top secret and even asked guests to fly into a different city, where they were later picked up and taken to the luxury ranch location. \nAllison previously admitted she had delayed her wedding to Ricky - to whom she has been engaged since February 2014 - due to the controversy surrounding her father Brian. The NBC news presenter was suspended earlier this year for embellishing details of his experiences while reporting on the front lines of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. allison williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:37:01.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
