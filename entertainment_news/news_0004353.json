That's the thrust of a new bill by Assemblyman Tom Abinanti, D-Greenburgh, Westchester County, that would prohibit New York restaurants from using polystyrene containers to package leftover food.\nThe new requirement for doggy bags” would significantly reduce the use of Styrofoam by encouraging food service establishments to seek alternatives.\n“Styrofoam causes significant harm to the environment and may be a health hazard,” said Abinanti, a member of the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, in a statement. “We need a concerted state effort to reduce reliance on Styrofoam and encourage more environmentally-friendly alternatives.”\nAbinanti said at least 100 municipalities across the country banned the use of Styrofoam, including New York City, Albany County, Suffolk County and Glen Cove on Long Island. New York City's ban was overturned , though.\nThe bill doesn't have a sponsor in the Republican-led Senate.\nMcDonald’s in September said it would switch from foam cups to paper cups.\n“New York should take the lead and prioritize reducing the use of Styrofoam,” Abinanti said. “The health of tomorrow’s environment depends on what we do today.”\n(AP Photo)", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/judge-overturns-styrofoam-ban-article-1.2369805", "http://nrn.com/sustainability/mcdonald-s-phase-out-plastic-foam-cups", "http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=A08408&term=&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Votes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:51:24.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
