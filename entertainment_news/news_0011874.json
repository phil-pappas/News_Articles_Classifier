And soon the Navy Pier Ferris wheel will have vanished completely from the city's skyline, to be replaced next year by a taller and more expensive Ferris wheel.\nDo you care? Should you care?\nMaybe you have read the stories about its demise, watched the televised news reports. There have been enough of them and maybe, just maybe, these brought back memories. But the wheel was only 20 years old so it never really had the chance to work its way into the collective memory of the city, of generations. Hey, it wasn't Riverview or old Comiskey or even your neighborhood tavern or hot dog stand that was coming down. And I have the feeling — bolstered by some anecdotal evidence gathered from asking a few dozen random Chicagoans if they ever rode the wheel and getting a large majority of \"No\" answers — that this was an entertainment mainly enjoyed by tourists. It and many of the other diversions at the Pier are aimed at tourists and that's just fine. Tourists spend money and the city certainly needs money and every penny that can be squeezed from visitors from Japan, Germany or Iowa helps.\nI rode the going-going-gone wheel more than a few times, many of them in the delightful company of a little girl who thought riding on it was quite fun until she turned about 8. She hasn't mentioned it in the three years since.\nThe only adults I ever rode with were a Tribune photographer and the late, great actor and quintessential Chicago guy Dennis Farina. We had just finished lunch — Farina had a Caesar salad with strips of broiled chicken, if you must know — when I suggested a ride and he said, \"Oh, why not?\"\nThere was a line for the wheel but quickly enough we were in a gondola, rising, and for many long and uncomfortable minutes the man, the former cop with the rough-and-tumble screen persona flashed the unmistakable look of terror, looking not down or out at the city but at the floor of the gondola as he held tight to its railing.\nThe last days of the Navy Pier Ferris wheel Visitors to the Navy Pier Ferris wheel talk about what makes the attraction special to them. The Ferris wheel will be removed this weekend and replaced with a new 196-foot wheel in summer 2016.

(Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune)\nSee more videos As our gondola reached the top and paused for a few swaying seconds, the photographer and I commented on the fine view, though the shimmering skyline (that wall of high-rises to the west) effectively hid the neighborhoods, including Old Town, where Farina and I both grew up.\nAs the wheel began its second turn, Farina was breathing easier and when we reached the top again, he looked out at the city and said, \"Wow. Wow. Wow.\"\nCertainly thousands of others shared that sentiment. But can you even imagine how people felt riding the first Ferris wheel that towered above the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park?\nIt was a great wonder of the world. Two-hundred-and-fifty feet in diameter (height) and carrying 36 cars, each able to accommodate 60 wide-eyed passengers, it was an engineering marvel and an entertainment that taxed the vocabularies of even the most superlative-minded.\nAt the time the tallest building in Chicago was the world's first skyscraper. The Home Insurance Building was 10 stories and 138 feet tall when built in 1885, with two additional floors added in 1890. The Wright Brothers were still a decade away from their first flight. So the riders of the Ferris wheel were afforded views only available to birds and clouds.\nLast go-round for Ferris wheel at Navy Pier Sarah Freishtat Teboho Masupha remembers when a ride on the Navy Pier Ferris wheel cost a fraction of the current price.\nOther than that, the Pier Park assistant operations manager said, not much about the wheel has changed since he started working as a host at the park in 2001.\n\"The Ferris wheel is its own structure,\"...\nTeboho Masupha remembers when a ride on the Navy Pier Ferris wheel cost a fraction of the current price.\nOther than that, the Pier Park assistant operations manager said, not much about the wheel has changed since he started working as a host at the park in 2001.\n\"The Ferris wheel is its own structure,\"...\n(Sarah Freishtat) In its nearly five months at the fair the wheel took nearly 1.5 million paying passengers into the air, as well as many more thousands of dignitaries, investors and members of the press who were given free rides. At first, some were skeptical that the wheel's design was sturdy enough to support the weight of cars and passengers. So 10 days before it opened to the public, the wheel's riders included the fair's construction chief, Daniel Burnham, and Margaret Ferris, the wife of its creator.\nThat wheel too came down, of course. In the spring following the end of the fair, the wheel was dismantled and moved (at a cost of $14,000 and over 86 days) to an area near Clark Street and Wrightwood Avenue. There it would, some investors hoped, anchor an entertainment complex with landscaped grounds, a restaurant, band shell and vaudeville house.\nBut the crowds never came. Perhaps the novelty had worn off. Investors lost their shirts, and in 1896 its creator, George Washington Gale Ferris, died of tuberculosis. He was only 37 and wasn't around on the June day in 1904 when his great wheel was sold at auction for a mere $1,800. As reported in the pages of the Tribune, \"The auction was a touching scene, marked with the usual reminiscences of past glory.\"\nEarlier in 1905, you could see crews of workmen dismantling the wheel, and many assumed its pieces were to be scattered as scrap across the land. But visitors to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis later that year found the wheel, pieced back together and again set in motion. But after that fair closed the Ferris wheel was dismantled and sold as scrap and gone for good. And so it goes.\nThere are now Ferris wheels in cities across the globe and our new Navy Pier Ferris wheel is scheduled to be up and turning by the middle of next year. It will be 196 feet tall, nearly 50 feet higher than the old wheel but still smaller than that first wheel. Its 42 gondolas will be bigger too, able to accommodate eight adults and two children in what is being called \"temperature-controlled space,\" which seems a small shame, since half the fun of that old wheel was feeling the breeze, hot or cold.\nrkogan@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @rickkogan\n Travel", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bf3ca/turbine/ct-navy-pier-ferris-wheel-kogan-sidewalks-ent-1013-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5608a20e/turbine/ct-navy-pier-ferris-wheel-last-day-met-20150927", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560471a8/turbine/ct-navy-pier-ferris-wheel-150924-video"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:28:06.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
