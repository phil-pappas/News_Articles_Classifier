'Inside Amato, by Furne One' immediately gained success with fashion insiders from around the globe and has been nominated for Best Documentary at the 2015 International Fashion Film Awards, Beverly Hills, CA on Sunday the 25th.\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) October 20, 2015\nRocco Leo Gaglioti of Fashion News Live has created his debut documentary on Amato Haute Couture, Dubai based fashion house to the stars and it has been an immediate success among the fashion elite. The film, which Gaglioti both directed and produced, takes the audience beyond the front row and behind the scenes of one of the worlds most exclusive and sought after designers Furne One (Oh-Nay).\nUnlike many fashion shorts, ‘Inside Amato by Furne One’ is not a glorified ad. It is the real and raw truth behind the fashion industry. The documentary takes the audience on a journey into the world of Amato Haute Couture, from inspiration to creation to the development of the fashion house’s most recent collection and runway show ‘Love is a Battlefield’ which has been a huge success around the globe showing at NYFW, Art Hearts Fashion LA and at Fashion Forward Dubai. For information on the film including trailer please visit the film’s website http://www.insideamato.com.\nRocco Leo Gaglioti is a creator, producer, director and host. He founded the televised on-line fashion magazine, FashionNewsLive.com, which almost overnight has become ranked as one of the top ten out of the 150 million fashion and celebrity sites around the world. In 1994 a Miami model scout with an eye for spotting talent advised Rocco to try his hand at modeling. Miami quickly turned into Milan and Paris, which turned into New York and the rest is history. The 6’5 former model may dress head to toe in Marc Jacobs and Gucci, but that is not what makes him fashion’s latest “It Guy.” It’s more than likely the combination of his soulfulness, his uncanny ability for discerning the next big thing and his beguiling quintessence that landed him on the pop culture radar and will undoubtedly make him a household name. This year Rocco is being inducted into the Taste Awards Hall of Fame.\nFurne One, creative director of Amato Haute Couture, has dressed celebrities such as Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Heidi Klum, Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, and Olivia Palermo.
