Meredith Woerner Contact Reporter \nThe first trailer for \"Jessica Jones\" has finally dropped, introducing an entirely new world to the Marvel Universe: grim reality. \nBased on the comics by Brian Michael Bendis, \"Jessica Jones\" follows the journey of a retired superhero. Krysten Ritter plays the former \"Jewel,\" who hangs up her cape after a very vile and dangerous run-in with villain Zebediah Killgrave, a.k.a. the Purple Man (not the violet hue throughout the new trailer). \nSIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter >> \nPlayed by David Tennant, Killgrave has the power to make people do whatever he wishes, making him sadistic and dangerous. Also in this trailer is Mike Colter, who plays superhero (and future love interest of Jessica Jones) Luke Cage. \nThe pilot premiered at New York Comic Con to pretty stellar reviews, with a hint of shock. The series is not for children and will delve into exceedingly adult issues, but that's kind of the point. So it's very interesting to see Marvel, whose television and movie offerings have been handed to the public mostly with a nod and a wink, turn an eye toward reality. \n\"Jessica Jones\" is set to premiere on Netflix on Nov. 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:10:36.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
