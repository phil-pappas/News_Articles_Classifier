You share a room with others in an entirely different manner from the way you would share a highway â€“ such as an information highway,\" notes the author. \"Buildings provide a measure of accountability, which in turn yields a measure of authenticity. And there's the magic word: authenticity.\"\nMankind over the centuries has developed a superb set of methods and procedures for establishing and conveying authenticity. New digital \"construction materials\" combined with these old processes will deliver precisely what we're looking for: privacy, security, reliability, authenticity.\nAs the founder of Delphi Internet Services Corporation, which was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News America Corp., Wes Kussmaul has been conceiving and creating secure online spaces since 1981.\nQuiet Enjoyment is written for CEOs, COOs and CFOs rather than technologists. To learn more about Authenticity, read Quiet Enjoyment by Wes Kussmaul , 457 pages, ISBN 978-1-931248-05-1, published by PKI Press and available in eBook and print form from https://pkipress.com/ and other booksellers.
