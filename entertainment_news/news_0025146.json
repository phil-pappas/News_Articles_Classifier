Odom is currently in a coma and remains unresponsive in a Las Vegas hospital. \nSince Odom was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel on Tuesday, his estranged wife Khloe Kardashian has been at his bedside, responsible for making decisions about his medical care because she is still technically his wife, People reports. Odom and Kardashian signed divorce papers in July after splitting in 2013, but since their case has not yet been entered into court, their marriage still stands legally. \nSources say that Khloe is \"lost,\" trying to make decisions for him. \nScott Disick checks into rehab for drug and alcohol addiction \nThe former Lakers player's condition is currently being treated as an overdose . He has also possibly suffered an ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blood clot cutting off blood flow to the brain. \nDespite an earlier People report that had claimed E! filmed Khloe as she rushed to Odom's side, E! denied this claim. The network told EW that \" Keeping Up With the Kardashians is not currently shooting in Las Vegas.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:46:02.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
