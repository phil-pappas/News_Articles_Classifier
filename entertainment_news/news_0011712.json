Being the total performer that she is, Minaj treated her fans to an eye-catching see-through outfit on Saturday as she rapped a verse from The Weeknds’s hit track, “The Hills.” \nYAS @NICKIMINAJ joined @theweeknd for a surprise performance on SNL and it was EVERYTHING http://t.co/R9WnvDtItD pic.twitter.com/aUFuuVMSqr \n— Cosmopolitan (@Cosmopolitan) October 11, 2015 \nMinaj has no reservations about putting her voluptuous body on display in all her performances. For her appearance on Saturday Night Live , she wore a purple and red dress that highlighted her curves, which revealed a high-waisted thong underneath. The ultra-sheer fabric of the body hugging Balmain dress did not stop Minaj from going braless; the only coverage she wore were nipple pasties. \nThe violet and orange frock featured a plunging neckline that bared the rapper’s entire chest. Her knee-high leather Alexander McQueen boots added a touch of edginess to her sultry look. Minaj also made sure to take a lot of photos of her daring look and shared it on social media. She showed off her curves from every angle. \nThe 31-year-old hit maker joined host Amy Schumer and special guest The Weeknd onstage towards the end of the show. However, while Minaj smiled before the cameras, her nipple pasty peeped out of her long-sleeved dress. Still, the “Anaconda” singer was lucky to not experience any major wardrobe malfunction. \nWith the kind of dress Minaj wore that night, her breasts could have peeked out from her designer outfit at any given moment but luckily her nipple pasty stayed in place the entire time. Although only the pasty slipped out, many viewers of the show were sure it was a “total nip slip.” \nDespite the slight wardrobe malfunction , her performance with The Weeknd, whose name is Abel Tesfaye in real life, was spectacular. Minaj provided a sexy energy to the Saturday Night Live studio when she suddenly came out on stage and rapid spit her lines. <noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ASwmAI5plw\" width=\"616\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></noscript> \nThe lyrics of the song is about a lustful relationship with lines alluding to sex and drugs. “Remember that time I showed up with just panties under my coat? High heels they was knee-high, my legs grippin’ that throat…” \nOne of the lines of the song oddly used an analogy that included U.S. President Obama and Vice President Biden. “You the president and I’m Biden, just slide in cause you safe, n—-, third base,” Minaj rapped. \nThe Weeknd and Minaj appeared on Saturday Night Live to promote their remix and during the performance, The Weeknd could not take his eyes off of Minaj who completed her look with a pale glossy lipstick for a perfect pout and wore her straight locks down. She wore a very pronounced cat-eye winged eyeliner, which highlighted her expressive eyes. \n“Lol I had so much fun performing on Saturday Night Live . They’re always a pleasure to be around,” Minaj shared on her Instagram along with a photo of her and The Weeknd performing on Saturday Night Live. \nFollowing their amazing performance, rapper Eminem also shared his own remix of the song and tweeted the track was too good to pass up. \nMinaj jetted to New York the following morning and she was photographed heading to her private jet in her expensive Maybach. She climbed on top of the million dollar car for a snap and shared it along with the caption: “When u race Maybachs to the Clearport then get bent on the G4.” \nProving that she is a style icon, the rapper posted another Instagram photo of her showing off her designer fur sneakers. “LOV my fur sneakers by @giuseppezanottiworld Straight out of Paris Jacket by @giuseppezanottiworld as well. Shades by PUCCI attitude by #Onika,” Minaj wrote on her social media page. \n[Image by Ethan Miller, Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:33:58.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
