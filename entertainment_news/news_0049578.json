READ MORE: \nCrew members working on the BBC dance show have branded the Aussie star ‘the vainest ever celebrity in the show’s history’, which is a pretty bold claim considering Jerry Hall was once a contestant. \nPeter Andre \nAccording to The Sun, Pete spends so much time in the make-up chair and looking in the mirror that he’s giving the female dancers a run for their money in the maintenance stakes. \n“He’s just as fussy with his hair and spends ages getting it right.” \nPeter and and dance partner Janette \nThe 42-year-old, who is the favourite to win this year’s series, is also keen to show off his gym-toned body in the hope it’ll will encourage his fans to vote for him. \n“He goes through all his costumes again and again to ensure they show off his chest and bum,” the source added. \nBut Pete reckons the reason he spends so much time in the ‘Strictly’ make-up chair is because he’s having such a laugh with the crew. \n“I do spend time with the make-up team but I’m in there telling bad jokes constantly. They’re all a good laugh,” he explained. \nR ght. \nPete got off to a flying start on last weekend's show after his first ‘Strictly’ dance saw him top the leaderboard. \nHis cha cha cha to Christina Aguilera’s ‘Ain’t No Other Man’ with his professional partner, Janette Manrara, earned the highest score of the night, with 30 points. \nAn enthusiastic Bruno Tonioli branded him “snake hips”, during his critiques, adding: “I loved the performance level… that’s the way it should be.” \nThis weekend will see Pete dance the Quickstep to 'Valerie' by The Zutons (if he can extract himself from that make-up chair).
