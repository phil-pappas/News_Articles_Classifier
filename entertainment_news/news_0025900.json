Otonana Trio is a 3-piece indie funk band from Tokyo, Japan and consist of lead vocalist/guitarist Kentaro Saito, Kazuhisa Maekawa on bass, and Hikari Kuroda on drums.\nThe tour is in support of their forthcoming 10-track album \"The Lost Ramen Generation\" which will debut on iTunes October 13th. For tour dates, event times and further information visit www.Facebook.com/OtonanaTrio/events\nSelf-described as the Japanese version of P-funk with a touch of Hendrix, Les Claypool, and Sheila E, Otonana Trio has become a staple in the Tokyo music scene. The trio is known for their hyped-up live performance sets and ability to get the crowd moving and shaking.\nOne of their most popular singles, \"Ramen War III\" (from the last album) is a fun anthem like that has garnered much attention and has quickly become a fan favorite. You can check out the official music video to \"Ramen War III\" on Youtube at https://youtu.be/C3syhMHzR0I The band is also planning to release several new music videos for \"The Lost Ramen Generation.\"\nInternationally, Otonana Trio has played over 300 shows at which more than eighty percent were dive bars; It was during these events that they learned the crowds want to dance. This influenced the band's evolution from modern jazz to a lively, high-energy funk sound. The music will keep the crowd on their feet from beginning to end.\nAbout Otonana Trio\nKentaro Saito is not new to the American music scene; in fact he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in Hollywood with awards and has a degree in jazz performance. He had a jazz band but soon decided that jazz wasn't going to reach the masses. Kentaro moved back to Japan but after the Earthquake he decided to give America another chance and formed the Otonana Trio, with the help of an old band mate. Once he found Hikari Kuroda and Kazuhisa Maekawa he took a different approach by playing the Japanese version of P-funk. Now they are going on tour and ready to make everyone dance.\nOfficial Website: www.otonanatrio.com\n release/japanese-band-otonana-trio-announce-dates-for-upcoming-us-tour-413965.php", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.facebook.com/otonanatrio/events", "https://youtu.be/C3syhMHzR0I", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/japanese-band-otonana-trio-announce-dates-for-upcoming-us-tour-413965.php"], "published": "2015-10-09T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:25:13.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
