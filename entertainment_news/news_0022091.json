Oswald's Pharmacy, now located in the Naperville Plaza shopping center, recently expanded itys medical supply department. (Courtesy of Oswald's Pharmacy) The pharmacy, also a Chamber of Commerce member for 101 years, exemplifies some of Naperville's traditions of growth, innovation, and economic perseverance, started by W. W. Wickel in 1875. He was succeeded in 1915 by his son-in-law Louis Oswald, Arnold's great-grandfather, who changed the name to Oswald's.\nHe added a soda fountain and the Rexall franchise, a drug powerhouse in the 1950s, to the growing store. Son-in-law Harold Kester took over the store in 1954, expanding three times, and in response to a growing clientele he added a franchise fragrance and cosmetic line in favor of the soda fountain to the store. After Kester retired in 1977 his son-in-law Bob Anderson, Bill's father, took over. Bob continued with the tradition of innovative changes by introducing the first computerized operations in a Naperville pharmacy. When he retired in 1991 his son Bill Anderson took over the pharmacy.\nIn 2004 Oswald pharmacy moved to the popular Naperville Plaza shopping center, at 88 Gartner Road.\n\"In 2005 Oswald's won the Naperville Area Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the Year award in the retail category,\" according to a company statement. In 2006, Oswald's joined the Health Mart Pharmacy franchise, according to the company.\nDaina Saleh is a freelance reporter for the Naperville Sun.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Naperville Sun", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56186f3a/turbine/oswalds1-jpeg-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56186f39/turbine/ct-nvs-oswalds-anniversary-st-1011-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:52:28.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
