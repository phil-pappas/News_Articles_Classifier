(AP) - Another Pennsylvania university has rescinded an honorary degree granted to Bill Cosby.\nLehigh University said Wednesday that conduct described by Cosby in a 2005 deposition is antithetical to its values.\nCourt documents unsealed in July show the 78-year-old Cosby admitting extramarital relationships with several women, some of whom accuse him of sexual assault.\nCosby has never been charged with a crime.\nLehigh awarded the honorary degree to the comedian in 2004. It says in a statement that his admitted behavior was \"inconsistent with the character and high standards\" expected of honorees.\nSeveral other schools, including Fordham, Marquette, Baylor and Pennsylvania's Wilkes University, have already pulled their Cosby degrees.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
