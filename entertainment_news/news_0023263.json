That could mean a Fitbit activity tracker a jogger is wearing as they whoosh past you. If you've seen a commercial for the Apple Watch, you've seen a \"wearable.\" But it's also coming to include everything from Bluetooth-enabled jewelry to hearing aids to clothing with sensors built into the fabric (get ready for sweat-detecting bike shorts!), shoes with pedometers built-in or even eyewear like the too-soon-for-the-masses product Google Glass.\nCome to think of it, wouldn't the Casio calculator watches of the 1980s count? And what about the megapowerful smartphones many of us have been carrying in our pockets since around 2007?\nThe difference is the idea that this newer generation of wearables -- smaller, less obtrusive, more integrated into our bodies and clothing -- is taking off as its own category led by companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google and thousands of startups who've decided it's the Age of Wearable Gadgets.\nTech forecasters are bullish on these products. The research firm IDC estimates 72.1 million wearable devices will ship in 2015, a sharp increase from 26.4 million last year. That includes Internet-connected smartwatches like the Apple Watch, but also basic fitness trackers that don't do things like run apps or allow you to pay for coffee at Starbucks.\nBut it's not all a story of wild success. Apple has been gun-shy about revealing actual sales numbers of its Apple Watch, which received mixed reviews earlier this year as a Version 1.0 product that's really not for everyone -- particularly if you don't own an iPhone. And both smartwatches and fitness trackers are fighting the perception that they're novelty items that people get tired of quickly, sticking them in a drawer after just a few months of use. In fact data released last year suggested just that; a third to a half of gadget buyers eventually ditch their fitness trackers or smartwatches.\nWith that all in mind, I showed up at a one-day conference in downtown Austin, Texas, called Rock Stars of Wearables recently. The first sign of trouble was that there were no guitars or pyrotechnics and that the first \"rock star\" I witnessed on stage was a business director in a suit from Qualcomm.\nOdd branding aside, the day was a time for those in the industry to chart the exciting future of wearables, both inside and out. What I learned, shockingly, is that even those who are fully committed to making wearables a thing in our lives agree that they have a long way to go.\nBattery life is an issue, especially with devices you're meant to keep on all the time, such as the Apple Watch. Eyewear devices like Google Glass can face a social backlash if they're viewed as a privacy violation by those around the person wearing them. Some devices that could potentially dispense medicine or be surgically implanted or swallowed -- so-called \"digestibles\" -- face FDA hurdles.\nJennifer Darmour of Chrono Therapeautics got to my biggest knock on wearables as I've seen them so far: They're often clunky in form and function. And many companies making them don't seem to be asking, \"Who are these products for and what problem are you trying to solve?\"\nThe era of sleek smartphones and wireless-speakers-as-furniture has made us less patient for wearables we'd never actual wear outside the house. \"People want their products to be well-made and they want them to be beautiful,\" Darmour said. \"And I'm not talking about blinging out wearables. It's understand who your audience is and being aesthetically beautiful to them.\"\nAnd if wearables are really going to succeed, they need better interfaces and to serve not as one more distracting screen to look at but as an invisible bridge to, say, controlling our home environment, keeping track of our fitness habits or interacting with the world around us.\nTom Emrich of the Canadian company We Are Wearables said it was less about making cyborgs with technology that eats away at our humanity than making superhumans who are augmented with technology that helps us live in the moment.\nThese devices, he said, \"will be unfettered by screens and work side by side with us in the real world. They'll allow us to reconnect to ourselves, reconnect to the world around us and even to a higher power.\"\nI almost got a lump in my throat when Emrich said, \"They'll allow us to become human again.\"\nThen I remembered, \"Wait, we're already humans.\" When did we give up on that idea?\nMy own experiment at Rock Stars of Wearables was a much-more low tech wearable I brought along from an Austin company called Runnur. The \"iBand Sling\" is a sash you wear across your body like a bandoleer -- or, if you're fancy, a pageant sash. It holds smartphones, keys, money, sunglasses and any portable tech you can fit into it, perfect for music festivals or a hike.\nI thought I'd get lots of comments and feedback at the conference as I walked around wearing the iBand. No one mentioned it at all or acknowledged that I was wearing a thing that could carry all these wearables that everybody was talking about all day.\nI spoke to Andrew Hamra, the owner of Runnur, who's been selling the iBand Sling in different colors at handsfreecarryall.com, as well as a more corporate-focused line of products that can hold larger devices like iPads in a sling. If you've seen technicians or music festival workers toting tablets in a secure carrying harness, Hamra is likely behind it.\nHe calls the iBand Sling \"Fanny Pack 2.0,\" and don't get him started on why he'd never wear a traditional fanny pack. (Spoiler: They're not considered cool to wear.)\nHamra, like the speakers at Rock Stars of Wearables, has for years been thinking about how we wear our gadgets and how those habits are changing. He thinks about how long it takes to pull an iPhone from a pair of skinny jeans; it should take less than two seconds, he believes.\n\"Technology is the new gold,\" Hamra says. \"But the tool is not useful unless you can carry it with you.\"\nAnd it's not useful if you can't keep your hands free and if the wearable -- be it a smartwatch or a Pancho Villa-like gadget strap across your chest -- looks silly or stops being something you want to keep on your body on a regular basis.\nThat may be why a lot of us are still trying to figure out whether wearables are really our thing and whether we're going to yield valuable real estate on our bodies to them.\n(Read more technology news on Omar L.
