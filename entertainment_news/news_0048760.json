She sends her interns to a very high end sex club to search for anything useful in her new case. Meanwhile, Annalise is still representing the siblings accused of killing their parents, but the case takes a turn for the worse when a new motive surfaces, and Wes teams up with an unexpected ally. Since there won't be a murder without a dead body, a preview for the next episode teases another casualty. There are also scenes that hint someone sneaks into Annalise's house and something scares her. \"It's Called the Octopus\" airs Thursday, October 8 at 10 P.M. on ABC. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:28:17.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
