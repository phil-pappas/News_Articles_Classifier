The publication also mentioned that Perrie wanted to have fun following the split. The website wrote that the Little Mix singer had several secret dates with the alum of \"The Only Way Is Essex\" after they first met at the Daily Mirror's Pride of Britain Awards in September. Perrie was reportedly introduced to Joey at the awards event by pals. After their first meetup, the pair allegedly exchanged phone numbers. Both Perrie and Joey reportedly got in touch quite intensively. The website quoted a source as saying, \"It's very early days, but Perrie likes Joey because he makes her laugh. They are just getting to know each other and taking things slowly, but Joey is already smitten.\" According to the website, Perrie didn't take her relationship with the 25-year-old reality TV star seriously. It was because she had just experienced bitter breakup. \"Perrie has just come out of a serious relationship and is enjoying having fun right now,\" the source explained. Responding to the report, a rep for the \"Black Magic\" singer told Mail Online, \"Perrie is not dating Joey.\" Furthermore, Perrie previously admitted that she's enjoying her single life, \"I'm having an absolute blast. We have a bit of banter with guys in nightclubs... I love it. I'm feeling brilliant and I'm in a good place.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:31.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
