Agnes Varda Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune \nFrench New Wave filmmaker Agnes Varda's work as a filmmaker, photographer and visual artist is the subject of a weeklong retrospective titled \"CineVardaExpo: Agnes Varda in Chicago.\" \nFrench New Wave filmmaker Agnes Varda's work as a filmmaker, photographer and visual artist is the subject of a weeklong retrospective titled \"CineVardaExpo: Agnes Varda in Chicago.\" (Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) Michael Phillips Contact Reporter Agnes Varda: \"I'm most interested in the moment somebody goes out of the frame.\" \n\"I never made money,\" Agnes Varda told me Thursday morning, on the patio outside the Logan Center for the Arts cafe on the University of Chicago campus. The sun shone brightly, though not as brightly as her chosen colors, from flaming red bobbed hair on top to vibrant purple handbag in her lap. Bold colors, she says, are her \"vitamins.\" \nOnly one of her films made money, she says: \"Vagabond,\" in 1985. \"But the other things, things I love, are still shown. This is nice.\" \nVarda, 87, is a pioneer of the French new wave. Her earliest work influenced the most famous nouvelle vague exporters (Jean-Luc Godard, et al.), whose work in turn influenced Varda. The chief exporters were men; she was the woman, married to \"Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" auteur Jacques Demy. Varda made her way against patronizing societal odds, odds that aren't much better for female filmmakers today. \nHer best known feature, the 1962 masterwork \"Cleo from 5 to 7,\" covers 90 minutes (the title is a liar) in the day of a woman waiting to hear results of a biopsy. It is a blithe, uniquely textured portrait of Paris, of Varda's perceptions and emotions. It disarms every second, even today. \nVarda's work as a filmmaker, photographer and visual artist is the subject of an expansive weeklong retrospective, dotted by screenings, curated by Dominique Bluher, titled \"CineVardaExpo: Agnes Varda in Chicago.\" The Logan Center focal point, which runs through Nov. 8, presents 11 works of photography and video under the title \"Photographs Get Moving (potatoes and shells too).\" The evidence on display ranges from the years 1949 to 2014. The three-screen video installation \"Patatutopia,\" which debuted in the 2003 Venice Biennale, is dominated by what Varda calls \"a carpet of potatoes,\" approximately 1,300 pounds' worth. She has long been fascinated by potatoes, how they look, the way they age. \nVarda's visit comes on the heels of some tragic cinematic news: the death earlier this week of filmmaker Chantal Akerman. \n\"I knew her. I liked her and admired her,\" Varda said. \"The relationship to time in (Akerman's masterwork) 'Jeanne Dielman' is so interesting. You can say, on the one hand, that, yes, it is a long film. But she was grabbing the texture of that woman's life, her day, the bizarre contradictions, the way she's raising her son. ... Chantal would work very hard, and well, and then suddenly go back to feeling bad. She was fighting the difficulty of being alive. But what a talent, what intelligence.\" \n\"Cleo from 5 to 7\" is one of several Varda films screening this week in honor of her University of Chicago residency, and she'll introduce the film Wednesday at the Music Box Theatre screening. \"I too dealt with time, real time, real movement,\" she says. \"The language of cinema is the ellipsis. You know? I touch my luggage, and suddenly (in the next shot) I'm in a train. I take my keys, then I'm home. But there I was dealing with continuous time and distance in a new way. We didn't cheat with the distance, the trajectory. People still study that film. I go to South Korea, they talk about it.\" \nThursday morning, Varda, Bluher and Varda's assistant (also visiting from Paris) Stephanie Scanvic toured the Logan Center gallery space. Varda liked what she saw, though she wanted to increase the contrast in some of the video components. \"A bit pale,\" she said. Adjustments were underway shortly after our conversation. \nOne video in the exhibit, \"The People on the Terrace,\" sprang from a still photograph Varda made 51 years earlier, that of a random group of people. The film, a few droll minutes in length, imagines a scenario and a set of relationships among the figures she photographed decades earlier. \n\"I have that question always,\" Varda told me. \"Whatever I look at, I wonder. I'm most interested in the moment somebody goes out of the frame. Where do they go? Images are so important to me. I love them. And I question them, all the time.\" \nFor the full schedule of public events, screenings and exhibitions in \"CineVardaExpo: Agnes Varda in Chicago,\" go to varda.uchicago.edu . \nMichael Phillips is a Tribune critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:53:59.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
