This movie by the ‘Forrest Gump’ and ‘Who framed Roger Rabitt’ director takes you through those incredible moments of high risk achievement that are hard to recreate, leave alone outperform.\nWatch the trailer of 'The Walk' \n\nThe World Trade centre may have played host to several achievements but none so surreal and strange than aerial artist, Frenchman Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt)'s 200 ft long, high tightwire walk, risking life and limb 1370 feet above ground level. And he did it without a safety net and harness. The unimaginable event took place on August 7, 1974, lasting 45 minutes and adding to the risk were cops atop both towers waiting to apprehend him for his illegal act. What comes across from the film and the celebrated documentary ('Man on Wire') before it, is the implicit trust that Petit had on his instincts and training.\nRobert Zemeckis in fact covers all that, including his attempts to get to the top of the heavily guarded towers to pitch his wire for the feat, albeit with the help of his lady love (Charlotte Le Bon) and other assorted team members. While the Oscar winning documentary 'Man on Wire' was an amazing documentary it did not have footage of the original act to go with it. So it was up to Robert Zemeckis to equal the feat with cinematic accessories. And he does that with great majesty. Unfortunately the story telling device employed- a first person account with Petit atop the Statue of Liberty, sprouting forth bombastically about his great achievement, is a little belittling to the overall engagement.\nThe acting is solid, if not exactly extraordinary. And the Imax heightens the dread and the perception to incredible heights. CGI is also quite majestic. This is simply note-worthy entertainment brought about by the best technicians in the business of cinema.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:37:03.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
