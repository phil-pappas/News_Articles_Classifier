A settlement in a lawsuit over the car used in the 1985 film \"Back to the Future\" has hit a snag. In 2014,t he widow of automaker John DeLorean sued a Texas company she said has been illegally using the DeLorean name for years. The two sides in the lawsuit reached a preliminary settlement in June, 2015, that would pay an undisclosed amount of money to Sally DeLorean, who lives in New Jersey with her daughter. But her attorney wrote in a letter to the judge this week that the company's lawyers were trying to change the settlement at the last minute.
