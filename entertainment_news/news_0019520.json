They will gather again Monday in Lake Forest to begin preparing for the Week 8 game against the Vikings. Meanwhile, here's an in-depth look at how the defense has fared during the club's 2-4 start:\nKey storyline: New coordinator Vic Fangio has organized the defense, building it into a functional unit after two straight seasons among the NFL's worst. A few personnel additions, such as outside linebacker Pernell McPhee, have helped.\nOverall, though, it's clear that the roster must continue to evolve to polish its sullied reputation. A lack of playmakers stands out. Consistency is a major sticking point, particularly in a secondary that has yet to record an interception.\n\"That's awesome because we can only get better,\" defensive backs coach Ed Donatell quipped Tuesday when asked about the unflattering stat. \"I know the guys are working together, and the chemistry is good. They're good on their assignments. So that's coming. There's no question about it. It's a matter of when.\"\nThe new regime initially touted cornerback Kyle Fuller, the team's first-round pick in 2014, as a building block because of his instincts and physical style. But that has yet to materialize in a new scheme that prioritizes man-to-man coverage instead of the zone system for which previous management drafted him.\nPlays on the ball have been rare, while he has been on the wrong end of touchdowns and pass interference penalties. A key issue has been getting his head around in time to play the ball.\nOn the second level, coaches describe inside linebackers Shea McClellin and Christian Jones as ascending players. But six games into the new scheme, the flash plays, such as tackles for loss or forced turnovers, haven't been there to complete the process.\nUp front, a rotation of mostly young lineman still is developing. On the bright side, Jarvis Jenkins is on pace for a career-high nine sacks, and second-year tackle Will Sutton's ability to penetrate carried over to the new system. But Ego Ferguson, last year's second-round pick, had yet to forge his place in the team's future plans when he was put on the season-ending injured reserve list Oct. 17 with a patellar tendon injury.\nGood news: Some of the players new general manager Ryan Pace acquired during his first offseason cycle are contributing significantly. It bodes well for the roster building ahead, as Pace must make up for the failed efforts of his predecessors.\nMcPhee's four sacks lead the team, and he has an interception. Of more importance, perhaps, is his emergence as the heartbeat of the defense.\nFifth-round rookie safety Adrian Amos has done rather well as a tackler, which was an unknown because he played mostly cornerback at Penn State. Coaches like his professionalism and intelligence, too, as they wait for his ball production to surface.\nSecond-round nose tackle Eddie Goldman has improved his ability to hold the point and take on double teams. His endurance has improved along with his weight management.\nBad news: The Bears hoped an outside linebacker would emerge as a long-term solution opposite McPhee. Instead, the position is setting up to be one of the team's biggest needs next offseason.\nJared Allen got the first shot but was traded after Week 3. His departure created more playing time for Willie Young and Lamarr Houston. But Young hasn't proved he's a fit as a stand-up pass rusher, and Houston hasn't won over coaches.\nExtra point: McClellin is five games into his third position since the Bears drafted him in the first round of 2012. The former defensive end and strong-side linebacker has the confidence of the new staff because of intangibles.\nSaid inside linebackers coach Glenn Pires: \"I tell my guys, 'Don't have that television (with) the short little screen.' He has like a 70-inch. He can see a lot of things. Now he can go and flow.\"\nBut will that be enough to convince the team to re-sign him next offseason? To help his case, he must make impact plays.\nQuestions ahead: Will Fuller and Amos take the next step in their development and begin making plays on the ball?\n•Can Houston play with more power and consistency as he distances himself from the reconstructive right knee surgery he had last November?\n•How will the Bears' defensive line respond to the departure of Jeremiah Ratliff, who was released Thursday after a disruptive incident at team headquarters?\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\nPrivacy Policy Willie Young Shea McClellin Vic Fangio Minnesota Vikings John Fox NFL Lamarr Houston", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56298876/turbine/ct-bears-defense-at-break-spt-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:24:01.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
