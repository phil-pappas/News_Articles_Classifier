The owner was actually trying to run a rescue, but things were not the way that they should be. On Saturday, ABC News shared about what Sgt. Patrick Malloy had to say about this case. They actually took 60 cats and 2 dogs out of the home.\nThe authorities were contacted by a neighbor. They explained that the yard was full of bags of cat feces and that the house had a terrible odor. The home was described as unlivable by the neighbor. All of the animals were taken from the home and are now being checked out. It turns out that several of the cats were dehydrated and even underweight. The owner said they were trying to run a cat rescue, but it sounds like these cats actually needed to be rescued.\nThere was one cat found dead in the freezer, but at this time they believe it was euthanized. The owner of the home is now facing charges for animal cruelty. At this time, it is still unknown if the owner will end up being charged or not. Luckily someone contacted authorities and now these animals can be taken care of and checked out instead of living in these conditions.", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/60-cats-home-owner-run-rescue-34545617"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:26:43.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
