Algonkuin Theatre Projects, and its founding artistic director, Marty BlackEagle-Carl, merit a much bigger audience than the one at hand on Saturday evening, for serving up Schaffer’s delightful comedy with such verve and style. It’s not merely a must for PBS enthusiasts, and Anglophiles in general, but for anyone seeking the pleasure of consummately executed theater.\nLettice is a tour guide for the Fustian House in Wiltshire, England, a 16th-century manor house. It’s a dull and dreary historical landmark that prompts Lettice to wildly embellish the rote informational monologue that bores her group of tourists into a state of somnolence. Her initial mundane description of Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Faustian House transposes into an ever escalating romantic, heroic, and festive reverie: John Faustian saving the queen from falling down the “Staircase of Ennoblement,” and nobility feasting on egg-yolk glazed hedgehogs. Suddenly her tourists are enraptured by her spurious storytelling.\nThat is, except for a Surly Man (Clark Slocomb), who demands to see her references for such questionable details. She nervously skirts around directly answering him, and quickly brings the tour to an abrupt end. She’s an artful dodger, but not artful enough to escape the notice of Lotte Schoen (Nancy Hilliard), a fussy, matronly woman who works for Preservation Trust, the Architrave Place in London that owns Faustian House.\nThe pairing of these opposites is one that Nogueira and Hilliard enact with elegant, witty, charming delineation. When told her job is on the line, Lettice employs every bit of her theatrical suave to charm the civil servant sensibility of Lotte to see her side of things. Lettice tells her that her actress mother – who ran an all female touring Shakespeare troupe – insisted that one should live by the motto “Enlarge, Enlarge, Enlighten!”\nAfter tossing back a few drinks in Lettice’s basement apartment, the emotionally starchy Lotte loosens up to the fact she has more in common with Lettice than she thought. Over the homemade brew – lovage – they share, they realize they have a mutual passion for English history and architecture. Lotte tells Lettice she was once in love with a man who wanted to blow up modern buildings in London to oppose the destruction of historical architecture, that he and she had a secret alliance called END, short for Eyesore Negation Detachment. It was a doomed relationship when she wimped out on helping him blow up a wing of the Shell Building.\nThe show is laced with that sort of whimsical British humor, and though it can be a bit long-winded at times, Nogueira and Hilliard forge a lovely camaraderie that holds one’s attention with ease.\nWhen Lettice has need for legal representation – the details of why withheld here - Legge brings his customary excellence to the role of her lawyer, Mr. Bardolph.\nSuffice it to say that the final act of “Lettice and Lovage” becomes every bit as fanciful and outrageous as Lettice’s tourist guide fabrications.\nLynda Slocomb imparts Lotte’s secretary, Miss Framer, with the right touch of subservient anxiety. BlackEagle-Carl’s nubile set converts smoothly from Fustian House, to Lotte’s office, to Lettice’s basement apartment in Earls Court, London. His choice of music between scenes is a pleasingly eclectic playlist that includes, appropriately enough, the Masterpiece Theater and Downton Abbey themes, and The Clash’s “London Calling.”\nLiana Vincini, Jake Diggins, Terri Boelke, Amanda Slocomb and Brendan Boelke convincingly fill the bill as tourists taken in by Lettice’s revisionist storytelling. You will be too, by Nogueira’s captivating portrayal of her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:02:06.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
