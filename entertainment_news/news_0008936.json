Related Media Battle Mountain High School’s Future Business Leaders of America and the Vail Recreation District invite runners to “run for their lives” today during the Eagle-Vail Zombie Apocalypse 2-Mile Fun-Run-For-Your-Life. Participants in this 2-mile obstacle course can choose to be either a survivor or a brain-hungry zombie and will be forced to outwit, outrun and outlive each other in a race like no other. A Post-Apocalypse Party will follow the event, with food, music and prizes. Proceeds benefit Battle Mountain High School’s Future Business Leaders of America and the Eric Spry Memorial Scholarship Fund. Participation in the race — as either a zombie or a survivor — costs $25 on race day. Zombie runner registration and check-in will take place at 3 p.m. at the Eagle-Vail Pavilion Park, while survivor runner registration and check-in will take place at 3:30 p.m. at the Eagle-Vail Pavilion Park. The race will begin at 4 p.m. for ages 12 and younger and 4:15 p.m. for ages 13 and older. This is the final race of the VRD’s running race season.
