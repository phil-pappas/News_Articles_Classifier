Speaking at the press conference of the movie, the 48-year-old actor discussed about the experience he had while filming the movie based on 2008 Noida double murder case. Konkana, who will be seen portraying the role of Mrs. Nupur Talwar in the movie, also shed some light on her role saying that she did not really study the character, however it was really interesting for her to convey guilt and innocence at a different level. The movie's screenplay is written by Vishal, who got inspired from Japanese film 'Rashomon', to pen this flick. The movie, which was recently premiered at the 40th Toronto International Film Festival, will hit the screens in India on October 2.
