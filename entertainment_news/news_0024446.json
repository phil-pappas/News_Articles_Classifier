Vision: Channel Nine's Today Show. \nPT1M52S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-43ziq 620 349 October 6, 2015 - 2:23PM Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings ï»¿ Salim Mehajer's bizarre TV interview Today's Karl Stefanovic lost the power of speech during fit of hysterical laughter after watching highlights of Auburn deputy mayor Salim Mejaher confess his prime ministerial ambitions.\nToday showed a short clip of Mejaher's unforgettably awkward speech on, staged behind a lectern he insisted upon, with his new bride Aysha positioned \"two metres\" back, then cut to the studio. Host Stefanovic lost the plot and laughed for a full 20 seconds live on air.\nStill from the Today show showing Karl Stefanovic and Ray Hadley reacting to Salim Mejaher's announcement he wants to one day be Australian prime minister. Photo: Channel Nine \nBut his comments man, firebrand 2GB radio host Ray Hadley, who earlier this week lashed former NRL great Andrew Johns for a drunken public incident, stared stony-faced at the camera and blasted Mehajer: \"If brains were dynamite he wouldn't blow his ears off.\"\nAdvertisement \"The deputy mayor of Auburn is suffering delusions of adequacy ... if that's the best we can do at Auburn, Paul Toole the local government minister should today sack the entire council for electing this dope to be deputy mayor.\"\nAs Hadley does so often, he went too far, criticising Aysha Mehajer's looks. \"She looked like she'd fair dinkum been frightened by something. Her face was just cast in stone. I don't know how much you're spending on plastic surgery love but drop off.\"\nStefanovic again descended into a full gale of laughter before recovering his poise enough to close the segment without passing a single word in judgement. He didn't need to - his face said it all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:43:23.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
