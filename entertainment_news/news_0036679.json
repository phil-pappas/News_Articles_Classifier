A chartbuster all the way, its first track Hemanthamen... is rich with its quality lyrics and mellifluous tune, with a quintessential romantic flavour to it. Its treatment and mood are quite similar to that of Malare of Premam, which can be attributed to the common connect, Vijay Yesudas.\nHarinarayanan's lyrics are easy to remember and classy. Vineeth Sreenivasan sings the second song Dum Dum Dum , a fast number with enough space for some comic lines. It has a groove similar to that of some memorable yesteryear rhythmic tracks and can be a fun song to listen to.
