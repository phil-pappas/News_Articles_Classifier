The Central Bureau of Investigation is set to examine the will prepared by the couple between 2013 and 2014. The document reportedly states that all properties attached to either of the two spouses shall be passed on to the other in case if any one of them dies. \n“The Mumbai Police had recovered a copy of the will, which was made after Sheena’s death. This was handed to us when we took over the case from them. We have learnt it was Indrani who insisted Peter make the will. We want to know if there was any hidden motive in doing so,” a CBI official was quoted as saying by The Indian Express. (ALSO READ: Indrani Mukerjea denies suicide attempt. Was drug overdose planned to evade custody?) \nHowever, at the time of Sheena’s death, there was only Rs 15,000 deposited in her bank account. The deceased did not own a property either. There was no financial linkage between Sheena and mother Indrani except for the fact that the latter provided her daughter certain amount to meet her personal expenses. \nCBI is set to grill Indrani and Peter to investigate whether the will had any connection with the murder of Sheena Bora. Indrani, along with former driver Shyam Rai and ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna is accused of assassinating her daughter. The trio are currently detained in custody. Indrani is placed under special security in Byculla Women’s jail. \nModified Date: October 8, 2015 9:41 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:06:56.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
