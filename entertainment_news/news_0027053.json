I think you can keep talking about it and create more and more of a stamp of divide. I think we need to do more and stop talking about it.” \nShe cited practical solutions, like programmes encouraging female writers, as an answer. \nShe also told the magazine that despite all hailing from the United Kingdom, she doesn’t ‘hang out’ with other Brits such as Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch.
