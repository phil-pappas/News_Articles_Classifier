Photograph by: ' , File photo \nVancouver novelist Anakana Schofield has been named as one of the finalists for the prestigious $100,000 Scotiabank Giller Prize for her book, Martin John. \nAs a finalist she will receive $10,000. She will also get first dibs on the snacks at the Giller Prize awards dinner, which she jokes she’s particularly excited about and is already trying to find out what’s on the menu. \nThe winner will be announced live Nov. 10 on CBC television. \nThe 44-year-old previously wrote Malarky, winner of the 2013 Debut-Litzer Prize for Fiction and the 2012 Amazon.ca First Novel Award. \nSchofield, whose family lives in Ireland, moved to Vancouver in 1999, where she lives with her teenage son. She also writes literary criticism and has written for The Vancouver Sun, The Globe and Mail, The London Review of Books blog, The Guardian and The Irish Times. \nMartin John is described as a dark comic novel that explores the mind, motivations and preoccupations of a sexually deviant character many women have experienced but few have understood. He leaves Ireland on the advice of his mother to escape the consequences of his actions and moves to London, where he works as a security guard. \n“Damaged and destructive human beings can be fascinating. And creepy. It would be going too far to say that we can understand either Martin or his mother, but the genius of this novel is that it opens a window into the way profoundly broken people may think,” according to a recent Vancouver Sun book review. \nSchofield, along with the other four authors nominated, will host an event at the Vancouver Writers Fest on Oct. 21 at The Vancouver Playhouse. Her book launch is tonight at 7 p.m. at Book Warehouse at 4118 Main Street. \nThe Sun spoke to Schofield about the announcement: \nQ: What was the genesis for the story? \nA: As a human I’m deeply distressed by (the main character’s) behaviour and wanted to look at complicity. The mother won’t face the reality of her son’s behaviour. I didn’t find it unreasonable a mother could love her child that much but it’s hard to understand how a mother could be complicit knowing others are being hurt. When he’s young he commits a sexual assault where he punches a young woman in the vagina. \nOne in three or five women have been sexually abused. That was certainly a starting point. My interest is fiction and fiction is a place where you can ask difficult questions and you can speculate on emotions that govern that behaviour. \nThe book became what it needed to become. You never know what your novel will become. It was a brutal book and I worried a great deal with how it would be received. But I do have an almost blind faith in readers. You set a bar and people will join you. \nQ: How will you celebrate being shortlisted for the Giller Prize? \nA: I’m in bed now with a glass of hot port and my phone keeps ringing. I’ve even got media messages from Ireland. I don’t know what we’ll do to celebrate. I’m just so surprised I found myself on this list. I thought I had as much chance as a tadpole turning into a fig.... There will never be a day like this for me again. Hand to my heart, how this book has been received has really astonished me. \nQ: In your blog ( anakanaschofield.com ) you have said this was a tough novel to write. Why was that? \nA: I don’t write traditional mainstream novels. I’m interested in experience. Finding a form for the book was critical. The shape had to reflect the context of the book. It’s a funny book but it’s not easy. \nQ: Tell me about yourself? \nA: I’m a 44-year-old middle-aged, short woman with a teenage son going to public school in Vancouver. I’ve been a writer for most of my adult life. It’s been a long haul and I write fairly challenging novels so it’s immensely gratifying to see a work like this get recognized. I’ve been so blessed in this country. I’m a writer because of coming to Canada. The support and mentorship and kindness is really incredible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:42:37.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
