Federal St., downtown. \nSimeon Wright, cousin of Emmett Till, and Dale Killinger, the FBI agent who reopened the Till case in 2004, will be on hand to discuss the events that led to the kidnapping and murder of Till, as well as the motivation behind the reopening of the case. \nWright will describe the events of the night in August 1955 when 14-year-old Till, who had traveled from Chicago to Mississippi to visit relatives, was kidnapped from his uncle’s home in the middle of the night and murdered for wolf whistling at a white woman. \nKillinger will share the evidence in the case the FBI examined almost 40 years later. \nThe Emmett Till Traveling Exhibit from Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss., also will be on display. It includes pictures from the trial of the two men accused of murdering Till. \nFor information, contact Penny Wells, director of Mahoning Valley Sojourn to the Past, at pennywwells@sbcglobal.net or 330-207-4467. \nThursday’s event is sponsored by the Sojourn group and the Mahoning Valley Historical Society.
