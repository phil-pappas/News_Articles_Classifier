Happily, on a chill autumn evening in an olde worlde travelling tent, the former outnumber the latter.\nGlasgow-based punk-pop trio PAWS are hobbled from the off, their spirited racket completely out of place in the all-seated auditorium. They’re a game if gauche lot, though, and soldier on with a set culled mainly from 2014 album Youth Culture Forever and debut Cokefloat.
