It gained the attention of the band Kiss, whose frontman Gene Simmons says he was touched by Jack's story and heartened to see its music used for a greater purpose.\nPT4M1S http://www.canberratimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-3zerk 620 349 July 16, 2015 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Rod Laver Arena\nThursday 8th October 2015\n★★★☆ \nTaking the kids to see Kiss is certainly cheaper than going to Disneyland, which could well explain why so many little tykes were kept up on a school night Thursday to see 1970s American rockers. And be in no doubt, the travelling amusement park that Kiss has brought to Melbourne beats the overnight flight and the Mickey Mouse club hands down - or perhaps more accurately: hands up, with 'sign of the horns' fingers extended.\nBack for a \"40th anniversary\" tour, it would be fair to say that seeing two 60-something founding members fronting the cash cow that has kept them on the road and in clover  has the potential to be  dire, but there were lots of happy faces - young and old - seen leaving Rod Laver arena.\nKiss were letting it all hang out at Rod Laver Arena. Photo: Wayne Taylor \nThe reason is clear. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons nailed their act years ago and rarely stray from the formula. Still, despite their advancing years they hit their well-rehearsed set piece production with flair and precision. \nAdvertisement Kiss offered old style, simple music that was loud, but crisp. Humour that was as endearing as it is practised. To see Simmons wiggle his little finger accusingly at male fans before pointing to his massive codpiece is a sight that has to be seen once in a lifetime - if only to confirm that some lame jokes remain amusing long after high school.\nAnd while David Bowie may have famously brought a glass spider to Kooyong back in the 1980s, even the Starman who's (rightly) been getting all the kudos at ACMI would have to admit his rope lights would be no match for the spectacular 'spider stage' that Kiss use to scale the heights and accentuate the pyrotechnics. \nIt was on for young and old. Photo: Wayne Taylor \nAnd the songs? Well, no Kiss fan will be surprised to hear that there were no surprises. \nKicking off soon the stroke of 9pm with one of the great stadium rock openers \"Detroit Rock City\", lead singer Stanley, bassist Simmons, lead guitar Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer powered their way through a two hour, 19 song set heavy on songs from the 1970s and early 80s. \nHighlights included an enthusiastic version of \"Love Gun\" and the Kiss nod to disco \"I was Made for Loving You\", with the crowd finding voice and energy to mostly keep up with the band to the closing - and predictable -  confetti of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\". \nPaul Stanley may be getting on but wasn't lacking in energy. Photo: Wayne Taylor \nStanley has said several times he believes the band could outlive its founding members, touring the world as what amounts to licensed cabaret act for all time. Given the longevity of the marketing concept - if not the band members - and the devotion of its fans it's not an unlikely scenario. \nCertainly it's hard to see the fans letting Kiss die while the old blokes can still strut their stuff and offer a show that has the ability to make the faithful sing, laugh and share their memories all these years later. \nSome of those school aged kids dragged along in make-up may indeed be back in years to come to see that new cabaret incarnation of Kiss, but for the mums and dads who have been back to the well so many times over the past 40 years there may well be a looming choice ahead. \nThursday night they rocked, but is it time to quit while Kiss are still ahead?\n \n\nKISS SET LIST \nTHURSDAY NIGHT ROD LAVER ARENA (also play Friday)\n1. DETROIT ROCK CITY\nFireworks, mayhem and the spider stage ... The three guitarists ride the rig from the roof to the stage for the classic anthem about dying young. No slow painful death here. The sound is clear, crisp and not too loud. The old guys have come to play - although it's hard to think the energy levels will hold.\n2. DEUCE\nAn early standard from the mean streets of New York. \"You know your man is working hard\". Stanley and Simmons sure are, although the screen behind them keeps flashing up a barcode as reminder of why we're all here for a 40th anniversary tour. Ka'ching. \n3. PSYCHO CIRCUS\nStanley stops to address the crowd, promising those who have never been to a Kiss concert that they'll always remember where they were on October 8, 2015. \"Psycho Circus\" is an underrated stadium set piece, with Simmons playing the clown, posing for pictures and offering clapping instructions and cod piece advice to the crowd.\n4. CREATURES OF THE NIGHT\nPerhaps remembering that KISS fell on hard time after their Australian tour of 1980, Stanley introduces a song from 1982 noting: \"You can't stop what people want\". The album of the same name featured the band with glowing eyes (albeit with Eric Carr's fox instead of Peter Criss' Cat) ... no one's belling the Cat here - the fans are howling at the moon.\n5. I LOVE IT LOUD\nSimmons comes into his own with this shouty anthem of the same vintage.\n6. WAR MACHINE\nWith the history of Gene Simmons' family not far removed from the horrors of World War Two Europe there's something a little jarring about the animation featuring the Kiss Army as Stormtroopers caked in the familiar character make-up. Along with the Game of Thrones Dragons it's an effective prop for an always timely song delivered with conviction by the Demon, but like the rest of the show has a video game feel that saves anyone taking it all too seriously.\n7. DO YOU LOVE ME \nPaul Stanley's big come on echoing down the decades, with a montage behind the Starman playing clips from the band's various incarnations - including generous nods to departed founding members Peter Criss and Ace Freely. It's hilarious and touching tall at once to see Vinnie Vincent's Ankh Warrior and Eric Carr's Fox getting their moment in the spotlight\n8. HELL OR HELLELUJAH\nStanley claims this try-hard from the 2012 Monster album is a 'fine wine' that will become a classic with age. Employee turned employee-band member Tommy Thayer gets his guitar solo, and a chance to shoot off his own fireworks. The TV screens show he has a good manicurist and he certainly can play. Anyone realise Ace played in town not that long ago?\n9. DR LOVE\nThe Starman starts talking about the extremes in the weather of late and just when you think he's about to launch into a political statement about climate change he says: \"That's the sort of weather that makes you sick, you get rock n'roll pneumonia.\" Believe it or not then you call Dr Love. Simmons launches into his usual suggestive routine for this old classic complete with cod-piece fiddling and microphone swallowing. It's a hoot. \n10. LICK IT UP\nSee above ... \"Some of you weren't born in 1983,\" Stanley wryly notes about this ode to the obvious that is possibly the best 'old Kiss' song the band produced in their non-make-up years. \n11. GOD OF THUNDER\nThere's blood spatter and Simmons on a wire. It's a set piece, but one the crowd loves. \"I was born on Olympus, to my father a son,\" the Demon sings from atop the spider surrounded by dry ice. Hell, he almost looks like he is on that mountaintop. He almost looks like the god of rock'n'roll.\n12. GOLD GIN\nCan anyone tell me how Paul Stanley dares, let alone manages, to jump on platform shoes aged 63? Anyone at all. There's still admirable energy even this far into the show as the band reel off another classic from the 1970s.\n13. LOVE GUN\nThis is the run home as Stanley takes to the air across the crowd on a wire. It's a beauty too as the sound and his voice holds up and the iPhone camera go into overtime.\n14. BLACK DIAMOND \n\"Out on the streets for a living ...\" is the opening lines of this oldie, which could well be the marker for everything Stanley and Simmons has achieved - there's little doubt a few chords knocked out 40 years ago - along with all that merchandise - has kept them off the streets and in clover. \n16. SHANDI\nIt was a good try to include this big hit from the 1980 disco era, but there didn't seem to be enough Stellas in the audience to appreciate it, with Stanley appearing to cut the singalong  short just as the lighters started to burn fingers. \n17 SHOUT IT OUT LOUD\nChange of pace for the run home and the fireworks are back.\n18 I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU\nDisco's back too, but this time it's the huge hit from 1979's Dynasty album. There's the biggest cheer of the night for an individual song and the band nail it too, despite the lateness of the hour for old folk.\n19 ROCK N ROLL ALL NITE\nConfetti, explosions and the oh-so familiar riff. And not a minute past two hours on the clock. That's your fill Melbourne.
