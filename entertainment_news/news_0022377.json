Instead the British talent scout will replace Howard Stern on season 11 of America's Got Talent, NBC announced Thursday. \n\"I am really thrilled to be joining America's Got Talent next season,\" Cowell said in a statement. \"What I love about this show is that it's open to absolutely anyone. America has some fantastic talent just waiting to be discovered, and I would like that talent to come to our show, including any dogs who can sing!\" \nCowell won't need any pointers when it comes to judging AGT . He's an executive producer and creator of the series, which debuted in 2006. \nSeason 11 of America's Got Talent premieres on NBC in summer 2016. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
