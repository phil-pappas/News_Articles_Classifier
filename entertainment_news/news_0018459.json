Rapper Darryl (D.M.C.) McDaniels grew up in Hollis, Queens, dreaming of either being the next Grandmaster Flash or the next Stan Lee.\nHe long ago accomplished the former — selling more than 25 million records as a leader of the legendary hip-hop act, Run-DMC — so now he’s concentrating on the latter.\nThe 51-year-old hip-hop legend is heading to his second straight New York Comic Con this weekend with nothing less than industry domination in mind for his fledgling comic company, Darryl Makes Comics.\n\"I want to leave a legacy that inspires my young hip hop people,\" McDaniels, the DMC publisher, tells the News. \"The whole thing with the DMC universe is to introduce characters and entities and stories and ideas that will rival 'Star Wars.'\"\nNow two graphic novels into his partnership editor in chief Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez and former Shady Records A&R executive Rigo Morales, DMC envisions eventually spawning a superhero universe like that of Marvel or D.C. He’ll be selling copies of his new graphic novel, “DMC” #2,” at the Javits Center on Friday and Saturday in the Artist’s Alley section.\n\"DMC,\" the first graphic novel of which was released last year, is set in an alternate 1980s New York City where the rapper is a costumed vigilante.\nThe key for the real DMC was setting his superhero universe in a time he considers a golden age for New York.\ncourtesy of Darryl Makes Comics DMC’s comic universe is New York City in the 1980s. courtesy of Darryl Makes Comics DMC’s comic universe is New York City in the 1980s. Previous Next Enlarge \"We live in an ignorant, disrespectful time,\" says McDaniels. \"Everything about the ’80s — the music, the fashion, the look, the vibe, the sounds (were all better). Old school isn't just a time period, it's a consciousness.\"\n“Action Comics” writer Greg Pak, a big name in the business, fell in love with that consciousness when he read “DMC #1.”\n“I was pulled in a New York City of DMC's imagination, it was just a beautiful place to hang out,\" says Pak, who ended up being recruited as a script supervisor for the second book.\n“Our worst fear about a celebrity project is that they're just trying to get a movie deal, but this was clearly from a guy who loved comics,” he adds.\nMcDaniels has been captivated by comics long before Joseph (Run) Simmons convinced him to start rapping. Once a bespectacled kid who was picked on in Catholic school, he has his own secret origin story.\nAs a kid, he used to wear his blue blanket as a cape, held together by a safety pin, as he jumped around pretending to be Batman ... until his mother yelled at him to get off her couch.\nJames Keivom/New York Daily News Darryl McDaniels, the DMC of the rap group Run–D.M.C., is now publishing comic books. \"And my delivery,\" he says, breaking into one of his signature rhymes, \"'crash through walls/come through floors/bust through ceilings,' was inspired by the Hulk.\n\"For me hip hop was make believe,\" he adds. \"It did the same thing that comics did made me pretend I was a super hero.\"\nOf course, McDaniel’s visit to New York Comic Con isn’t entirely business.\n\"Last year, the first book actually gave me a really good reason to be at Comic Con as a fan,\" he says.\n\"The craziest things happened to me, like when a hundred (fans dressed as the Marvel Comics super hero) Deadpool came in, saw me they just came over and raised hell.\n\"They made me take a picture with like 20 of them,\" he adds, sounding more like a fanboy than a celebrity. \"That was exhilarating.\"\n\"DMC\" #2 will be available at his Comic-Con booth over the weekend for $20.
