By Hank H. Cox The Washington Post ‘81 Days Below Zero: The Incredible Survival Story of a World War II Pilot in Alaska’s Frozen Wilderness’ by Brian Murphy with Toula Vlahou Da Capo, 238 pp., $24.99 \nThis would be a great read at the beach on a hot summer day: A young airman survives a crash in the Alaskan wilderness in the dead of winter and somehow, through pluck and luck, survives in subzero temperatures for 81 days before being rescued. Of course, the reader knows going in that the hero survives, but it is a riveting story nonetheless. \n1st Lt. Leon Crane was co-pilot of a B-24 flying out of Ladd Field in December 1943 when the plane went down in bad weather. The B-24 was a reliable warhorse, but like many other wartime weapons, it had been rushed into service before all the bugs were worked out. Crane and his crew were gathering data on how the aircraft handled severe weather when it crashed. \nCrane was the only survivor, apparently not hurt at all. He found himself in a remote world of ice, snow and bitterly cold temperatures. By chance, he had some matches and a letter he had just received from his father, with which he started a fire to ward off the cold that first night. \nCrane had no idea where he was, and the military had no idea where the plane crashed. After a few days of futile searches, the plane and crew were written off, their relatives notified. Crane survived by trudging through mounds of snow for mile after mile. He finally found a cabin left behind by a gold miner who had thoughtfully stashed some food. After 20 days in the cabin, Crane sallied forth, having a variety of misadventures before he stumbled upon another cabin, this one with people in it.
