It is from these that \"A-Z\" is drawn.\nBoyd, an American who has spent much of his career in Britain, said he prefers to listen to music via song rather than artist, especially when traveling.\n\"I don't want to hear Billie Holiday for an hour in a row,\" he said, adding that he likes to pick one song alphabetically in his collection and let it all run on from there.\nAs a result his podcasts are either \"horizontal\" or \"vertical\", by which he means they either follow a single song or leap from one to another by theme.\nALPHABET SOUP\nAn example of the former is A, which essentially presents various versions of the 1920s song \"Ain't Misbehavin'\". It is not, however, simply about Fats Waller's definitive version versus the rest.\nBoyd weaves in the tale of one of America's first black diplomats, John Waller (no relation to Fats), his post-U.S. Civil War assignment to Madagascar, the French invasion of the island in the 1890s, and the birth of his grandson, a great nephew of Queen Ranavalona III.\nThe child, Andriamanantena Razafinkarefo, cut his name down to Andy Razaf and went on to write the lyrics to the early 20th century classics \"Ain't Misbehavin'\", \"Honeysuckle Rose\", and \"The Joint Is Jumpin'\".\nIn the upcoming L, Boyd goes vertical, taking The Pioneers' reggae song \"Long Shot Kicked The Bucket\" and segueing into Richard Thomson's folk-rocky \"Angels Took My Racehorse Away\" and Bill Monroe's bluegrass version of \"Molly And Tenbrook\" - all three about a racehorse that dies.\nTo finish up - illuminating the wealth found in musical genres - Boyd brings in Carlos Gardel, whose 1935 tango song \"Por Una Cabeza\" (\"By A Head\") links a tragic addiction to horse racing with a passion for women.\n\"Joe Boyd's A-Z\" can be heard free-of charge at:\nhere\n(Editing by Michael Roddy and Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": ["http://www.joeboyd.co.uk/podcast-player/"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:13:51.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
