But hundreds of costumed children descended on Tryon Palace and the N.C. History Center on Saturday for a special “All Hallow’s Eve” event, featuring treats, games and crafts, along with a variety of ghostly figures from the past. Alma Gibbons, as “Bloody Mary” entertained visiting children with stories near the stables, while Margaret Young, a retired art teacher, applied face paint. “Bloody Mary” was assisted by youngsters Gabriel Peyton and his sister Peyton. The visiting children wore costumes which were colorful and ranged from old school to contemporary characters. Lindsay Sassano, 5, came with her mom Amanda. The youngster was dressed as Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz.” “She picked it. She was adamant about it,” said her mother. “She has seen the movie so much she wore out the VHS tape and we had to buy one on digital.” Nearby was Molly Hollway, 6, with her mother, Mineko. They came from Trent Woods, where Molly chose the “good witch” look. “I might have to scare for some treats later,” the youngster said. Bailee Carmichael sported a Scooby Doo costume, a cartoon character that dates to the late 1960s, well before the 5-year-old’s time. Charmaine Clay of Maribel in Pamlico County, gathered her grandchildren from Pamlico and Carteret counties for a visit. “It seems like something special to do with the kids,” she said as they visited the history center. “Grandma was on the case, so the costumes were ready early.” Her troupe included Dylan Griffin, 10, as Captain America; Starla Armstrong, 6, as a witch; and Karma Armstrong, 8, as a hippie girl. The Palace offers shuttles from its South Front Street history center to the main Palace gates on Pollock Street. A special “shuttle pilot” on hand was volunteer Ryan Warner, dressed in a blue NASA astronaut flight suit. He knows the part, attending space camp in Huntsville, Ala., as a counselor. Ballerina Adelinea Henshaw, 8, and her 4-year-old sister Maya, a cat, came from River Bend with mom, Allison. “We were looking for something do to and this will be the first one (Halloween) Maya will really remember,” said mom. “She is excited to be a ‘kitty.’” The event also brought some out-of-town guests, including the Perry and Scheffler families from Belhaven. They rode the ferry across the Pamlico River to get to New Bern. Madison Scheffler, 8, came as Michelangelo, while Brenna Perry, 7, was a “cat pirate,” and 10-year-old Matthew Perry made his own box costume of a Mind Craft video game character.
