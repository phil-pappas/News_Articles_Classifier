Photo: Channel Nine \n\"Did it feel bad to shaft him?\" Stefanovic asked.\nAdvertisement \"That's a ridiculous question, Karl, and it's quite offensive, actually,\" Mr Morrison responded.\n\"Well, you did do that, didn't you?\"\n\"No I didn't, Karl. And if you want to suggest that you can back it up, mate,\" Mr Morrison said, before adding: \"I think that's just playing some pretty pathetic politics over what will be, I think, a difficult day for Joe.\"\nStefanovic then asked the Treasurer: \"You sleep all right at night, though?\"\n\"I sleep well every night, mate,\" Mr Morrison shot back. \"How do you sleep?\"\nHowever, Mr Morrison appeared to reveal that he and Mr Hockey had still not spoken since the September spill that saw Mr Hockey and former prime minister Tony Abbott relegated to the backbench.\n\"I think last time we spoke was when we were talking about the pension changes, that's we what worked together on,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"We were professional colleagues who were getting the job done.\"\nï»¿\nBut he rejected Stefanovic's suggestion that this was a sign the pair were no longer \"mates\".\n\"No, it's not fair to say that; that we're not mates now,\" he said.\n\"There's no bitterness that goes on from these things. That's not Joe's nature and it's not mine.\"\nThe interview comes about a month after Mr Morrison's bruising encounter with 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley, who demanded the MP swear on a Bible that he had not betrayed Mr Abbott.\nMr Morrison called Hadley \"mate\" 18 times during the 17-minute exchange, later using a press conference to say he would not be \"bullied by anyone when it comes to my religion or faith\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:29:32.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
