The Relays Sport Wireless in-ear headphones are ultra-lightweight and durable with amazing sound, that will help make your workouts work for you.\nAfter more than one year of research to understand what consumers want and need in a sports headphone, Sol Republic packed Relays Sport Wireless with features that solve the pain points known in the market: comfort, a secure fit, sweat and water resistance as well as long battery life. Sol Republic also added many new features like quick-charge functionality and dual audio modes for optimal sound both indoors and out, enabling Relays Sport Wireless to deliver an uncompromised experience.\n\"We are music lovers and we know that music plays a critical role when you exercise,\" said Kevin Lee , CEO and Co-Founder of SOL REPUBLIC. \"Listening to a good song helps you maintain focus and work out harder. We don't want people to have to compromise comfort for quality of sound. We believe that the perfect combination of incredible sound, with a comfortable fit and ultra-durable design, will help motivate people to train harder and feel better.\"\nTo make the headphones feel weightless SOL REPUBLIC strategically placed the electronics and battery in ergonomic, water-resistant pods that sit naturally on the neck. The result is one of the lightest headphones in the market while also providing an extra-long 8+ hours of battery life – enough to power a week of workouts.\nRelays Sport Wireless can be plugged in for a quick charge while you put on your workout clothes and pack your gym bag. A 10-minute charge is all that's needed to power 60-minutes of exercise.\nMusic sounds differently inside and outside and SOL REPUBLIC took this into consideration when designing Relays Sport Wireless. Switch seamlessly between indoor and outdoor audio settings for optimized sound quality during your workout. Don't let your environment ruin your audio experience.\nDon't compromise your workout. Train Hard. Let the music power you.\nSOL REPUBLIC RELAYS SPORT WIRELESS are available in Black and Mint in different reward packages starting at $74.00 exclusively on www.indiegogo.com .\nAbout SOL REPUBLIC\nSOL REPUBLIC is a global consumer electronics and music lifestyle company dedicated to enhancing people's lives through style, sound and technology.
