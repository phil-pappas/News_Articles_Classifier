The five-day fashion extravaganza started here on Wednesday at NSIC Ground, and the second day witnessed a refreshing start with a collection that took its inspiration from travel, summer weddings and more. The first to start the presentation was designer Pratima Pandey whose collection titled “The Melody Affair” took fashionistas to the world of weddings. “You are invited to the Indian summer wedding, where we celebrate life, friends, family and oneself,” said the designer who has also been awarded for her eco-friendly collection in the past. The high point of the show was the usage of dabka, ari and Parsi embroidery as decoration and combination of various material techniques to create a spectacle on chanderi in simple cuts . While Pandey’s designs were inspired by Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s famous painting “The Swing”, the next presentation was of Rasa Jaipur, who created magic on the runway with their wearable clothing. The USP of the show was the print work embossed on the clothes that were primarily made in fabrics like crepe, georgettes and chiffon. Some of the pieces that grabbed eyeballs were Peshawar top, Ellora top, Lido maxi dress, Chandra jacket and the Rio dress. Last but not the least designer Tanvi Kedia took its inspiration from her travelling to Morocco and other Islamic countries in Asia. “The collection is about the urge to travel and the adventures through the journey,” said the designer. The collection comprised of alluring blouses, dresses, tunics, skirts embodying the effortless style synonymous with the Tanvi Kedia label.
