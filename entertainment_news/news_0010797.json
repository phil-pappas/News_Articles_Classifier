BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday summoned a number of leaders including Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, Sardhana (Uttar Pradesh) MLA Sangeet Som and Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj. \nOn Sunday, an urgent meeting was called by Amit Shah involving the tainted leaders of the party known for making communal remarks. According to sources within the meet, Shah lashed out at Khattar for his insensitive remarks against the minority community. The Haryana Chief Minister, in an interview to The Indian Express, said: “Muslims will be allowed to live in India, but they have to end up eating beef.” (ALSO READ: RSS mouthpiece quotes Veda to defend Dadri lynching; justifies Akhlaq’s murder, warns Muslims to respect sentiments of Hindus) \nShah also questioned controversial parliamentarian Sakhsi Maharaj for repeatedly making provocative remarks following the Dadri episode. Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma also drew flak for terming the murder of Akhlaq as an ‘accident based on misunderstanding’. Sardhana MLA Sangeet Som known for his role in the Muzzafarnagar riots was also present in the meet. However, he denied being reprimanded by the party chief. “We were here to meet BJP President, had discussion regarding party matters,” he said. \nThe plethora of insensitive statements made by BJP leaders with the intention of communally charging the atmosphere has brought disrepute to the party. In the wake of forthcoming Bihar elections, it seems to have dented the agenda of Vikas upheld by the saffron unit after being revamped by Modi. \n  12:47 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:14:24.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
