Virginia is poised to execute Prieto, a serial killer, who claims he's intellectually disabled using lethal injection drugs from Texas because the state's supply of another controversial drug will expire the day before the execution is supposed to take place. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, VIA AP Related article » A serial killer who had been convicted in an Ontario rape and slaying in 1990 -- and has since been convicted of other slayings -- has been executed in Virginia, in spite of a last-minute appeal Thursday night.\nAlfredo Prieto was pronounced dead at 9:17 p.m. EST on Thursday at the Greensville Correctional Center in Jarrat.\nThe 49-year-old was injected with a lethal three-drug combination, including the sedative pentobarbital, which Virginia received from Texas.\nPrieto, wearing jeans and a light blue shirt, showed no emotion as he was strapped to the gurney.\n“I would like to say thanks to all my lawyers, all my supporters and all my family members,” he said, before mumbling, “Get this over with.”\nThe El Salvador native was sentenced to death in Virginia in 2010 for the murder of a young couple more than two decades earlier. Rachael Raver and her boyfriend, Warren Fulton III, both 22, were found shot to death in a wooded area a few days after being seen at a Washington, D.C., nightspot.\nPrieto was on death row in California at the time for raping and murdering a 15-year-old girl in Ontario and was linked to the Virginia slayings through DNA evidence. California officials agreed to send him to Virginia on the rationale that it was more likely to carry out the execution.\nOn Thursday night, Prieto's attorneys had argued that one of the drugs used in the lethal injection process might cause him unnecessary suffering. A federal judge and then an appeals court rejected the argument.\nU.S. District Judge Henry Hudson, a former federal prosecutor and Fairfax circuit judge, heard assistant Virginia attorney general argue passionately to end the 27-year wait for the families of Prieto’s victims, Rachael Raver and Warren Fulton.\nBoth were shot to death, and Raver was raped, in a vacant lot near Reston, Virginia, in December 1988, and Prieto was sentenced to die in Fairfax in December 2010.\n“It is time for this to stop now,” said assistant Virginia attorney general Margaret O’Shea. “It is time for the carousel to end. It is time for justice.\nHudson agreed, issuing a written opinion three hours before Prieto’s scheduled 9 p.m. execution in Jarratt, Virginia.\nPrieto’s lawyers immediately appealed Hudson’s rulings, but were turned down by the appeals court.\nVirginia uses three drugs in its execution protocol: one to sedate the prisoner, one to stop his lungs and one to stop his heart. Prieto’s lawyers argued that compounded pentobarbital, the first drug in the process, had not been sufficiently tested for potency, sterility and stability, creating the possibility of “cruel and unusual punishment” for Prieto in his final minutes.\nAs anti-death penalty activists have campaigned against capital punishment, states have had trouble locating the drugs needed for executions. So Arnold Robinson, chief of corrections operations for Virginia, testified Thursday that he called his counterpart in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and obtained three vials of compounded pentobarbital, which another employee drove to Texas, picked up and drove back to Virginia.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvke9r-b88529711z.120151001162001000guucbkqh.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvke9r-b88529711z.120151001162001000guucbkqh.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:26:40.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
