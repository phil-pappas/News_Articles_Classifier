When were we born?\" She didn't see herself in the movies and shows that she loved. \nShe had \"no concept of any kind of discrimination or any kind of limitation in the industry. I had no idea,\" she said by phone from Los Angeles last month in the middle of a day of filming her CW breakout hit, \"Jane the Virgin.\" \"I just thought. 'We must not have been around. My parents must have started the Puerto Rican race!'\" \nRodriguez watched \"The Cosby Show,\" \"A Different World\" and \"Family Matters,\" because at least they featured characters of color. Even though they didn't have brown skin quite like hers, \"that was the closest I came to seeing anyone like me represented on screen in a positive light,\" she said. \"When I watched 'Full House,' I never existed. I was never portrayed. And when I did see us, we always had a very inferior position in life. \n\"That lack of visibility, that lack of relatability, really made me feel kind of alone in this world,\" Rodriguez added. \"It really made me feel a certain way about myself, about beauty, what I could and could not be.\" \nIf she had only known then what she knows now: that, at age 31, she would be the star of \"Jane the Virgin,\" the critically adored show entering its second season this fall; that she would win a Golden Globe for her performance as Jane and give an instantly viral acceptance speech touching on the idea of representation; that she see her face on Barbie-bright billboards all over L.A. and have a massive platform from which to speak out about diversity and acceptance. \nHere's what Rodriguez did know: She wanted to act. She wanted to change the way Latinos were represented in pop culture. She wanted to do her part to make sure that little girls — the next generation of Ginas — would have role models on TV who looked like them. \nShe describes herself as a \"pretty faithful person,\" and religion has centered her. It has \"made me realize that with great blessings come great responsibility. You cannot separate the two.\" \nAfter Rodriguez went from unknown to one-to-watch with her performance in \"Filly Brown,\" a hit at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, she had what, on paper, seemed like a dream opportunity: a role in Lifetime's \"Devious Maids.\" \nShe turned it down. \nHer family wasn't so sure. They asked her, \"Why are you trying to be a sacrificial lamb?\" And sometimes even Rodriguez wasn't so sure. She said she had \"those moments of, 'Oh, Gina, you better be freaking right about this! You know you did the right thing; did you do the right thing?'\" \n\"Listen,\" she said to her family then. \"I'm not trying to be Jesus! I don't think I'm the Second Coming. But I know this isn't my journey. I believe it so hard. I just knew that that wasn't my path, because it didn't feel right.\" \nBut \"Jane\" felt right, right away. Rodriguez said that five pages into the pilot script, she knew she had to be Jane. \nNot wholly defined by traits \nIn Jane, Rodriguez found a determined, funny, type-A, compassionate woman who could be described by a bunch of buzzwords — Latina, Catholic, virgin — but was not wholly defined by those traits. The nuances of the Latino American experience were accurately and lovingly portrayed. These three generations of women (Jane, her mother and her grandmother) talked and behaved in a way Rodriguez understood; Jane's grandmother spoke Spanish and Jane responded in English, just like Rodriguez did with her own grandparents. \n\"It's so fluidly graceful on this show, about Jane being American but having Latino roots, her not being afraid of who she is,\" said Rodriguez. \nThe show is a twist on a telenovela, which might sound gimmicky on paper: \"The pregnant virgin!\" But the axis of the \"Jane\" universe is the bond among the Villanueva women. Everything revolves around those authentic relationships. \nAbsurdity abounds: Jane's father, whose identity she never knew, turns out to be — gasp! — the star of one of Jane's favorite telenovelas, and the father of Jane's baby is not only the handsome, impossibly wealthy owner of the hotel where Jane works, but also — it can't be! — the stepson of Sin Rostro, a vicious drug lord, who — Dios mio! — was having an affair with her own stepdaughter, who — there's no way! — is the doctor who, distraught after catching her wife in bed with another woman, fails to give Jane a routine pap smear and — oh, no! — inseminates her instead. \nAnd this is all before we get into the underground plastic-surgery clinic, the homicides at the hotel, the faked death, the secret twins, the multiple proposals of marriage and the character who pretends to be paralyzed but rises from her wheelchair to shove Jane's grandmother down a flight of stairs.
