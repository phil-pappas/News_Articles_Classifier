Host Olly Murs commented, “That’s an audition.” Simon Cowell said that the performance “wasn’t as strong as their other two (auditions)” but said he would love to work with them. 4th Power \nThe all-Filipino girl group is composed of sisters Mylene, Celina, Irene and Almira Cercado aged 19-27. The video of their first audition where they performed Jessie J’s hit “Bang Bang” has gone viral and has amassed over 15 million views on The X Factor UK’s official Youtube channel in the last four weeks. \n4th Power now moves on to the Six Chair Challenge that starts next week where they will compete with 14 other acts in the Group category.
