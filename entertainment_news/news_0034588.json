He debuts as an actor through V K Prakash's (VKP) musical rom-com On The Rocks and is currently shooting for the film in Bengaluru. In a chat with Kochi Times, he speaks about his new turf of creativity:\nTell us about your character in On The Rocks It is a musical and I play a singer named Ananth Abraham, who is part of a band named On The Rocks. Apart from the 'music' connection, there isn't much similarity between Ananth and my personality in real life. I have always been quite a shy boy, while Ananth is outgoing. I wonder whether people would think this is how I am in real life after the movie (smiles) . I can't box him by tagging to any kind of personality, but let me clarify it is very different from myself. I also sport a beard for this character.\nHow is it trying a hand at acting? Soon after the Thaikkudam Bridge video of Mandaracheppundo got released, I started getting movie offers. However, being unsure about the field, I didn't want to take a leap. I am an artiste born and brought up in Mumbai and was not familiar with the film personalities in Mollywood to make a sound judgement. By the time VK Prakash sir's offer came my way, I knew that he is a known director and it is a good offer. That is how I decided to act. There weren't any auditions, but there was a workshop with Kuloor mash, in which I could understand how to handle my shyness. It also improved my confidence. Though I have attempted acting in college and for a music album, doing a full-fledged role is a new experience. I guess VKP picked me for the role as the story is that of a band and its vocalists. There are more offers too, but I want to tread carefully and also see how this fares, before committing to new ones.\nYou often make fun of your own Malayalam. Will you dub for yourself in the movie? VKP sir has told me that I can try it. I guess if I don't fare well, they might bring in someone else. As people are familiar with my voice, I think it's best if I give my voice.\nWhat is the most challenging aspect of acting? I am an introvert in real life. As my Malayalam isn't that good, I don't speak much as well. What challenged me the most was speaking in front of so many people, that too as a character who is cool and outgoing. It was quite an unprecedented thing for me.\nIs music taking a backseat, now that you foray into acting? There is no question of music taking a backseat! I had to keep away from it for a while because of this film's shooting, but music will remain my priority. As of now, I am awaiting the release of Thaikkudam's album. The few songs that we released have been garnering good response.\nHow different is the world of an actor from that of a musician? They are very different, and I am slowly exploring the world of an actor. As an actor, you should also know the technical sides such as camera angles. All that said, I am told not to act, but react to situations and that is what I have been trying to do.\nDo you have any dream roles? I guess what would suit me are characters of my age and appearance, and youth films like rom coms. I don't want to play a musician again and want to try diverse characters. If luck is on my side, I wish to work with filmmakers like Anjali Menon and Anwar Rasheed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:34:45.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
