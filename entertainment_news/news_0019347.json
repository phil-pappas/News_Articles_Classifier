Damn, why the f**k did u guys reach out to me for this article and photoshoot?' Amber writes on Instagram. \nAmber Rose was clearly unhappy when she learned that an article featuring her on GQ magazine dubbed her Kanye West 's \"infamous ex\" and Wiz Khalifa 's \"baby mama.\" The hip hop model took to Instagram on Tuesday, October 22 to slam the magazine over the labels. The 31-year-old model posted on the social media a snap of the article. It read, \"Amber Rose wrote the book on it. No, seriously: Kanye's infamous ex, Wiz Khalifa's baby mama, America's toughest bald babe since Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3, is about to publish a book of life lessons called 'How to Be a Bad B***h'.\" Foto kiriman Amber Rose (@amberrose) pada Okt 20, 2015 pada 3:00 PDT Amber expressed her disappointment in a caption for the snap. She wrote, \"Really @gq??? I'm so much more [than] Kanye's Ex or Wiz's baby's mama. Damn, why the f**k did u guys reach out to me for this article and photoshoot? To dumb me down?\" \"I talked about feminism and my Slutwalk... Wtf nice title smh I expected so much more from u guys and I'm so disappointed,\" Amber continued. \"I was so excited to be featured in GQ not realizing I was shooting for a tabloid. My slutwalk was for ignorant shit like this. Oh 'Her beautiful dark twisted journey to the top'? Nice pun. Negative af. Thx for nothing.\" Earlier this month, the model created a campaign titled \" Slut Walk \". It was declared as a means to express \"outrage toward issues of sexual violence, gender inequality, derogatory labeling and victim blaming.\" During her emotional speech at the event, she recalled how Kanye and Wiz slut-shammed her and expressed forgiveness to both of them. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Browse Amber Rose Pictures More Amber Rose News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:37:36.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
