Before he does that, however, he explained why he called his entire family to his house for dinner. \n\"I want you guys to eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we war,\" he said. \nLater, while Hakeem gave an interview with Sway to promote the album he leaked, he also got ahead of himself and promoted Lyon Dynasty's first artist -- a Latina girl group named Mirage à Trois . Hakeem promised to bring them by the radio station later this week. Too bad they didn't have a single, which led to Hakeem and Cookie butting heads in the studio to produce a radio-friendly track. \nAcross town, Dre was still trying to get his job back at Empire Records and it was clear he was ready to do anything. Cookie told him to use the fact that his wife, Rhonda, was expecting their first child to butter Lucious up. Still, when he finally told his father the good news, he didn't react like he thought he would -- instead he asked his son if he thought about the child's mental health. \n\"It doesn't run in my family,\" Dre shot back, clearly unaware that Lucious' mother also suffered from bipolar disorder. \nWill Lucious ever tell Dre the truth about the fact that bipolar disorder runs in their family? \nBack in the studio, Jamal just threw out the umpteenth producer. Clearly, he was having a creative road block. Becky knew what the issue was: \"Call her.\" \n\"Who?\" Jamal asked. \"Cookie,\" she replied. \nThere's no word if the two will ever get back in the studio together, especially now that Mirage à Trois was ready for their debut. But when they went to Sway to unveil their new hit, the lead singer Valentina -- played by real-life artist Becky G -- was late. Lucious strolled in not only to let them know he had bought the radio station -- a great idea from his son, Andre -- but that he had stolen their lead singer for his own label. \nCheckmate. Your move, Cookie! \nEmpire returns next Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern on Fox. \nCopyright © 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:36:20.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
