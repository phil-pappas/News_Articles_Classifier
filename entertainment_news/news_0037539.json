The composer's final opera is widely regarded as a bel canto masterpiece. Following the season theme, the heroine Elvira’s descent into madness is one of the most exquisitely refined musical portraits of insanity in opera. \nOne of Handel’s greatest operas – Orlando – comes to WNO in a production that uses musical virtuosity as a metaphor for insanity during Orlando’s \nvertiginous descent into madness. \nOrlando will be set in 1940s London during World War II, providing a fitting backdrop to heighten the emotional impact of the story against the devastation of the Blitz. \nThe season is completed with Sondheim’s musical masterpiece, Sweeney Todd, which explores not only the madness of the protagonist, but society as a whole. \nIt promises a musical with all the emotional impact of opera and will be a rare opportunity to hear Sweeney Todd with the celebrated WNO Chorus and Orchestra.
