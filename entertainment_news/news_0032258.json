The temperature reached 77 degrees Monday and the sky was clear, leading some to head to the beach or the park for some late-season sun. It was not, however, the warmest Oct. 12 on record â€” that was in 1938, when it reached 84 degrees.\nTuesday will be more seasonable but still pleasant, with a high around 62 degrees. There is a possibility of scattered showers, though, which will remain in place until Saturday.\nThe temperature will peak in the low 50s from Wednesday to Friday before dipping into the 40s over the weekend.\n\"It's just that time of year where you get the battles between air masses, the cold air and the warm air, and the jet streams fluctuating back and forth,\" said Steve Welch, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Buffalo. \"It's definitely typical fall weather where it'll be up and down.\"\nTuesday will not necessarily be the last time for warm weather in 2015. After the cool weekend, the temperature will rise again somewhat next Monday, Welch said, though it's too far out to predict what the temperature might be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:07:27.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
