Chinese Characters [photograph] retrieved from: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/chinese-characters.jpg This article continues the previous series explicating Claire Colebrook's explanation of the linguistic turn in philosophy. Straddling the divide between analytic and continental philosophy, but ultimately rejecting the more foundationalist tendencies of (early) analytic philosophy, Richard Rorty would eventually martial the work of philosophers such as Heidegger and Derrida in establishing this anti-foundationalist and discursive approach to philosophy. Questions of extra-linguistic \"truth\" were rejected as irrelevant and spurious, and philosophy instead became the tool of the activist to produce change in the world. \"For Rorty, the value of Derrida's philosophy was that it abandoned all sense of metaphysical foundations and instead considered philosophy as a kind of writing, and the value of Heidegger lay in the insistence that we are not subjects who perceive the world and who then represent that world \"in\" language. Instead, the very existence of a world, along with a sense of self or mind, is given through language.\"\nRorty ultimately saw the pragmatists, such as John Dewey, William James and C.S. Peirce, as a bridge by which analytic and continental philosophy could come to meet one another. Of course, Rorty's highly relativistic interpretations of the work of these pragmatists, especially that of Dewey, is hotly disputed and widely rejected by scholars of John Dewey. Of course, Rorty's reading of not only the pragmatists, but also of Heidegger, was quite selective and tendentious. In any case, the conditions of the emergence of certain discourses and worldviews from certain ways of speaking or writing about the world, became a crucial subject, mainly upon French thinkers such as Derrida, Foucalt, Barthes, Blanchot, Butler and Kristeva. Rorty was particularly hostile towards attempts by analytic philosophers, such as the logical positivists, to attempt to ground language in something objective and foundation.\nInstead of resting content with his initial psychologism, the critique of this philosophy by Frege led Husserl to attempt to ground intuitions in such a way that they had an objective foundation from which to start.\n\"Husserl responded to Frege's criticism by charting a path between psychologism - that the meaning of a sign is some mental act - and lingnuisticism, or the idea that there is no truth or sense outside language. Husserl argued for a from of transcendental phenomenology, in which we should not simply accept systems of signs...without intuiting the founding or instituting sense. For Husserl, understanding the meaning of, say, a mathematical proposition ultimately requires a grasp of the originating act or judgment. Thus to understand \"2 + 2 = 4\" does not mean we have to go back to the first actual person or worldly individual who thought or inscribed this judgment, but it does entail understanding that such signs formalize or give an ongoing stable sense to an act of so consciousness that would be true for any subject whatever.\"\nPost-Husserlian continental philosophers would reject this more foundationalistic approach to philosophy. Husserl wanted some way to ground signs rather than to reduce philosophy to nothing but the power of signs to establish discourses or worldviews. Indeed, one of the key differences between analytic and continental philosophy, despite, many emerging attempts at reconciliation, remains that analytic philosophers tend to want to ground the extra-linguistic in something, whether it be intentionality or human action, whereas continental philosophers tend to emphasize \"structures and processes beyond the human altogether.\" These extra-individual structures come to constitute the worldviews of discourses of individuals, and become the object of investigation for continental philosophers.\n\"...in continental philosophy, there is still a need to account for structures and processes (including language) that have a historical, material, ideal, social, political, or archival existence beyond human standing.\" Thus, continental philosophers tend to be concerned with contingent forces which come to constitute subjects according to specific norms. It was with Heidegger's emphasis on a linguistic world into which we are thrown, and in which we are always in the midst, rather than thinking of subjectivity as something which then uses language.\n\"Language emerges not as the creation of some distinct or presocial \"mind,\" \"subjectivity,\" or \"consciousness.\" Instead, we are \"thrown into a world that is already meaningful, already experienced as bearing a definite and determinate sense. The notion of mind or subjectivity as a being that is distinct from a lived and meaningful world only emerges when we forget that the world is first given to us through our engagement with it - or what Heidegger referred to as \"care.\"\"\nHeidegger became increasingly preoccupied with this in his later work, arguing that the notion of an extra-linguistic truth beyond language is only possible for those who forget \"the original disclosure of world through language.\" Heidegger argued that the experience of poetry \"where we once again see the ways in which language allows the world to be presented as a world, helps us to overcome a notion that there would be some pure experience of presence that philosophy might grasp beyond the ways in which the world is lived.\" Indeed, his \"later turn toward poetic language focused on the relationship between saying and thinking...\"...language...is...a gift through which thinking is made possible and or which we should be grateful. Indeed, Heidegger begins to question whether there is any \"we\" or \"self\" who would be the owner of language, instead suggesting that it is language that \"speaks\" and in doing so opens up a \"clearing\" in which being is revealed.\"", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rorty", "http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/20000/velka/chinese-characters.jpg", "http://www.academia.edu/1186021/Linguistic_Turn"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:43:16.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
