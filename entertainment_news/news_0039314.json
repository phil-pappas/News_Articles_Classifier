Tony and Sam Frost talk during tonight's cocktail party on The Bachelorette. Channel 10 Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nTHINGS got physical on The Bachelorette tonight as Sam Frost shared another kiss and a game of dodge ball bruised egos. \nSam selected dapper Bondi financial consultant Alex Cameron for a high-flying single date featuring two Tiger Moth planes. \nThe pair shared a kiss, which Alex was quizzed on when he returned to the mansion. \nBut unbeknownst to the other bachelors, Sam's first kiss was actually with construction manager Sasha Mielczarek last night. \nOn the group date, a game of extreme dodge ball had a surprising outcome. Kayne and Will prepare to play extreme dodge ball on The Bachelorette. Channel 10 \nThe blue team of \"jocks\" Sasha, Davey Lloyd and Dave Billsborrow struggled against red team captain Richie Strahan's \"dorks\" Will Ferrier and Kayne Buik. \n\"The boys didn't know what hit them; it was over in a matter of seconds,\" Richie said. \nThe jocks briefly rallied in the third round but it wasn't enough to beat the underdogs. \n\"I threw that little orange Cheetoh at Davey's stupid head, and the game was won by red,\" Will mused. \nThe three men earned some extra time with Sam in the surrounds of a Turkish bath house, which created some awkward moments. \n\"Alex has had the kiss, but we've had the exfoliation,\" Will joked. \nDespite surprising many of his bachelor mates with his dodge ball skills and having one-on-one time with Sam, Perth musician Will Ferrier was one of two suitors Frost sent packing tonight. \nSam admitted she wasn't sure she could see a future with the \"oddball\". \nThe Bachelorette did form a closer bond with Richie, who opened up about his parents' divorce. \n\"After today I can certainly see Richie as someone I can be with in the future,\" she said. \n\"I know he's the type of person who would stick by me in thick and thin.\" \nThere was a whiff of desperation in the air at the cocktail party as the men vied for alone time with Sam. \nSoccer player Michael Turnbull gave her a \"mix tape\" full of cards with fun facts about him including a \"free kiss\" voucher. Michael presents Sam Frost with a gift during tonight's cocktail party on The Bachelorette. Channel 10 \nThen Sasha presented Sam with a hand-drawn picture of her lucky number four to show off his artistic side. \nExercise physiologist Kieren Nicholson also didn't receive a rose from Sam. \n\"I definitely would have liked a one-on-one date, when I could have shown her who I am,\" he said. \n\"All I want for Sam is happiness. There's something special about her; she is an amazing girl.\" \nNext week's episode will see Davey and Tony go on a casino-themed \"double date\" with Sam, and only one will get to stay on the show. \nThe Bachelorette airs Wednesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm on Channel 10. channel 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:35:47.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
