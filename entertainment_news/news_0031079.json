Lamar was found unconscious in a VIP suite at the brothel on Tuesday and was rushed to a hospital, where he remains comatose and in critical condition .\nWehrly ​said callers confirmed he had used cocaine on Saturday but were \"unsure if it had continued through the weekend.\" She said they also told dispatchers Lamar had used up to 10 tablets of sexual performance enhancing supplements.\nMore From Cosmopolitan ​On one of the three 911 calls released to the media , a male caller ​ identified as Richard Hunter , media director for the ranch, told the 911 operator that Lamar was seen doing cocaine on Saturday.\n\" ​Somebody came up to me and told me he had some cocaine on him,\" he said. \"He did this on Saturday.\" ( E! News reported ​\" virtually every drug imaginable was found in [Lamar's] system \" after he was brought to the hospital. He is reportedly being treated for a suspected drug overdose.)\nIn Tuesday's 911 call from the Love Ranch, Hunter also ​ described a package of Reload sexual enhancement pills that were found with Lamar. The caller read the package's label, which described it as a \" ​72 hour strong sexual performance enhancer for men.\"\n\"They say he's taken a bunch of these. So he has done that, ​\" Hunter said.\nIn 2013, the FDA issued a warning to consumers about a hidden ingredient in Reload, strongly urging the public not to consume the product.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail FDA \"​ FDA laboratory analysis confirmed that 'Reload' contains sildenafil , the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED),\" the 2013 FDA statement reads. \"This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates.\"\n\"​ Consumers should stop using this product immediately and throw it away,\" the statement reads. TMZ reports Lamar purchased Reload at the Love Ranch; sheriff officers seized the remaining inventory of the product during their initial investigation.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Getty ​During Wednesday's press conference, Wehrly ​said Lamar was taken to the Las Vegas Sunrise Hospital around 6 p.m. on Tuesday evening. A few hours later, detectives in Nye County obtained a search warrant to get a sample of Lamar's blood. Detectives came to Lamar's hospital room in Las Vegas later that night to serve the warrant. Wehrly said the blood is currently awaiting processing at the crime lab.\n\"At this point, the case is ongoing,\" said Wehrly. She said if the department finds that someone at the brothel was somehow involved or responsible, they would be held accountable. \"We're only after the truth here,\" she said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1444891462-ucm355963-1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x2105/gallery-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/768x1010/gallery-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://fox11online.com/news/entertainment/former-nba-star-odom-found-unconscious-at-nevada-brothel-10-14-2015-030749590", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1280x1684/gallery-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/14/lamar-odom-fda-sex-pills-reload-viagra-fda/", "http://www.nyecountysheriffsoffice.com/press-releases.html", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x800/landscape-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm355955.htm", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/640x842/gallery-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/480x631/gallery-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/980x1289/gallery-1444892042-gettyimages-462380069.jpg", "http://www.drugs.com/cdi/sildenafil.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:08:37.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
