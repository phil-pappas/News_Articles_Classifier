And surprisingly it is not with regards to her latest film ‘Shaandaar’ . Alia Bhatt commented on feminism and there you go – she gets trolled once again by one of the renowned celebrity hairstylist and ex-Bigg Boss contestant Sapna Bhavnani. Sapna Bhavnani had grabbed everyone’s attention in the sixth season of Bigg Boss. Sapna has always been vocal about her feelings and thoughts. Sapna who is a tomboy at heart has taken a dig at the ‘Student Of The Year’ actress Alia Bhatt, who was heard speaking on a radio channel about feminism. The very popular celebrity hairstylist apparently heard Alia saying that she is ‘part feminist’ and for those words, Alia gets trolled in a Shaandaar way once again.

Here is post shared by Sapna on the micro-blogging site Twitter: (ALSO READ: Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra enjoy the latest Bollywood trend of AirBoarding) just heard aalia bhatt on radio saying shes a part feminist. lol is she really that duh What is a part feminist help WomanEmpowerment \n— Sapna Moti Bhavnani (@sapnabhavnani) October 25, 2015 This is not new to the ‘Shaandaar’ lady or to the nation. In the past Alia has made such goof ups. The very popular one is when she said Prithviraj Chavan was the President of India. Alia said this on the popular show Koffee with Karan that is hosted by Indian filmmaker Karan Johar. The nation could not stop laughing when she made such blunder on national television. We guess it is going to be a never ending one from Alia’s end.
