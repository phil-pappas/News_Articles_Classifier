Sir Cliff Richard on stage (Joe Giddens/PA) \nOfficially Britain’s greatest solo hit-maker, his output of 123 hit singles and 101 albums is unlikely to be equalled, let alone surpassed. \nSir Cliff’s greatest hits include chart-toppers such as The Young Ones, Living Doll, Summer Holiday, We Don’t Talk Anymore and 1988 Christmas number one Mistletoe And Wine. \nAlongside Elvis Presley, the septuagenarian holds the record for featuring in each of the first six decades of the UK singles chart (1950s-2000s). He is also the only act to have had a number one single in the UK in five consecutive decades. \nSir Cliff has sold more than 250 million units worldwide, with over 21 million singles in the UK alone, making him the third top-selling singles artist in UK chart history, behind The Beatles and second-placed Elvis. \nBranded “the Peter Pan of pop” thanks to his comparatively youthful appearance, Sir Cliff has never married or had children.

Cliff Richard in 1963 (AP/PA) \nYoung Harry became interested in skiffle music, but everything changed when he heard the King of Rock and Roll sing. \n“Elvis was my reason for existing as a rock singer,” he told ClassicBands.com. “Had there been no Elvis, I don’t think there would’ve been a Cliff Richard either.” \nTeaming up with a backing band that would evolve into The Shadows (who became stars in their own right), Sir Cliff modelled himself on his idol for his 1958 debut Move It. \nA year later, the genial star and The Shadows were making movies. \nIn 1960, ITV commenced a seven-year television relationship with the entertainer. Feature films The Young Ones (1961) and Summer Holiday (1963) cemented his clean-cut image. \nSir Cliff became a practising Christian in 1964. Four years later, he represented the UK in the Eurovision song contest with Congratulations, but lost to Spain by one point. \nThe BBC cashed in on his popularity with variety show It’s Cliff Richard from 1970-1974, and he tried Eurovision again in 1973 with Power To All Our Friends, finishing the night in third place. Cliff Richard in 1982 (John Glanville/AP/PA) \nThe hits continued during the 1970s, with Devil Woman and We Don’t Talk Anymore as particular highlights. \nBy the early 1980s, Sir Cliff was being name-checked by the late Rik Mayall in anarchic comedy The Young Ones.

Sir Cliff Richard as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights (PA) \nDespite many stations refusing to play it, The Millennium Prayer topped the UK singles chart in 1999. It is his last number one to date, but Sir Cliff has continued to make music for his dedicated fanbase. \nHe started in the rock and roll era and went on to watch Beatlemania explode, glam rock thrive, punk erupt, disco, hip-hop and dance music break out. And he’s still making music today. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 2′s Paul O’Grady in August, the entertainer said: “When you start your career, you have no concept about longevity, for me you don’t know what’s going to happen, so how it’s gone on I’ve no idea.” Share article \nSir Cliff Richard plays the Albert Hall as part of his 75th Birthday Tour from Monday October 12 to Sunday October 18.
