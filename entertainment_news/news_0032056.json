Produced by Dil Raju, Supreme's regular shooting commenced last week and Sai is said to be playing the role of a cab driver. If the latest buzz surrounding the film is to be believed, the makers of Supreme are planning to remix Megastar Chiranjeevi's super hit song from Yamudiki Mogudu, 'Supreme Hero'. Interestingly, Sai Dharam Tej was given the 'Supreme Hero' title in the title cards of Subramanyam For Sale. If the news indeed turns out to be true, this will be yet another Chiru remix song for Sai, after the successful remix of Guvva Gorinkatho from Khaidi No 786 in Subramanyam For Sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:26:50.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
