But it happened to Candice DeLong.\nIf that name sounds familiar, it should. DeLong hosts the intriguing crime series \"Deadly Women\" on Investigation Discovery channel.\nAnd she's not just a talking head there. She was a profiler for the FBI, recruited when an FBI agent heard her speech about her work at a Chicago hospital.\nShe was excited about the new job, she says, seated in a coffee bar in a hotel here. \"In fact, I came to realize that FBI agents, cops, detectives, their jobs are not so dissimilar from a psychiatric nurse.\"\nLike some of them, she worked in maximum security. \"Psychiatric nurses have to be good at talking and listening. You're dealing with people at their worst, helping them find answers, and periodically dealing with unexpected events, sometimes violence,\" says DeLong, who's wearing a black suit with dark grey stripes, her short brown hair falling in spiky bangs on her forehead. \"That's like being a cop or a detective. So it wasn't that much of a stretch for me.\"\nDuring her stint with the FBI (she retired 15 years ago) she was assigned some fascinating cases, including the Tylenol poisoning case in the Chicago area where seven died when it was discovered that someone was lacing Tylenol tablets with cyanide.\nShe worked on the Chandra Levy murder. And she spent six weeks in rural Montana on the Ted Kaczynski -- Unabomber -- task force.\n\"I did the undercover work on that case, spent the afternoon with Ted Kaczynski when we were searching his cabin ... He wasn't mentally ill. I know he pled insane, and the government accepted his plea. He was disturbed. He knew what he was doing. I read his journals,\" she says.\n\"He saw himself as kind of Robin Hood defending society against evil corporations and whatnot. I spent the afternoon with Kaczynski ... I couldn't talk to him about the case because he said he wanted a lawyer. So once they say that, you can't talk about the case.\n\"So we're sitting in this mountain cabin while we were searching HIS cabin. I just asked, 'So what's it like living off the land?' I already knew the answer. I'd read everything about him. Let's just chit-chat. He told me how to boil turnips on an open stove. How boring! And all I could think of while he was droning on was, 'This is the worst date I've ever been on. And little does this man know a boiled turnip will never cross these lips, ever,'\" she grins.\n\"And he was kind of trembling. Even though that day in Montana was the warmest day so far, and inside the cabin it was up to about 55-60 degrees. I leaned over and put my hand on his chest. He was wearing a threadbare T-shirt. And I realized he wasn't trembling from the cold, he was trembling from fear. And I really liked that.\"\nAfter all these nefarious encounters, DeLong is reluctant to say she believes in pure evil. \"When I was little I was raised Catholic, so evil to me means the devil with a pitchfork. I think of all the people I've interviewed that have committed murder, in my show it's been 36, and in my two careers many more than that. I've interviewed very few natural-born killers.\n\"Most people convicted of murder and sent to prison killed one specific person for one specific reason. They're sentenced for life â€“ that usually means 20 years. If they're a good boy or girl that means 12 to 15 years and they're out ... Most people I've interviewed appear to be good people that got caught up in something,\" she says.\n\"I've interviewed a lot of women who fell in love with the wrong guy and allowed themselves to be influenced. But ultimately I've never been able to understand, and I probably never will ... I can't imagine. I can't imagine any woman being so in love that they would kill for that person, or kill to keep them. I don't understand that. It's not in me. It's not in most people.\"\nDivorced, DeLong is the mother of a grown son, Seth, who just finished law school and is helping her write her new book. Her earlier book, \"Special Agent: My Life on the Front Lines as a Woman in the FBI,\" landed on the Amazon best-seller list its first summer.\nShe does think that some evil-doers are born that way. \"Their moral compass, the arrow didn't point anywhere. They just didn't have one. If you want to call that evil, then they're evil. For me evil is people who commit premeditated murder and then lie. There are people that have black hearts,\" she acknowledges.\n\"Psychopaths are born, sociopaths are made. They have a lot of similar characteristic but how they come about is different.\"\nShe says babies who suffer physical neglect or abuse hate the world by the time they're 12 or 13 and become sociopaths. But with psychopaths, it's a matter of genetics.\n\"Psychopaths lost the DNA dice-toss. They're born with a gene where they have no empathy for others. If they can get away with something they will. They'd rather be crooked than straight. These are the people that will see a wallet sitting on the table, snatch it, and they've already got $500 in their pocket. They're born that way. Most psychopaths are not violent. But the ones that are violent make headlines, like Ted Bundy. They enjoy killing.\"\nFew people truly deserve the title \"legend,\" but Chita Rivera is one of them. Rivera has been kicking up her heels and belting out songs for 70 years in shows like \"West Side Story,\" \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" and \"Chicago.\" That galvanized energy will be celebrated on Nov. 6 when PBS presents \"Great Performances -- Chita Rivera: A Lot of Livin' to Do.\" (check local listings)\nRivera explains how she consistently summons that charismatic voltage. \"First of all, rehearsals are a blessing. You get used to space and what you're doing, so you have some confidence in what you're doing,\" she says.\n\"And being a gypsy, being a dancer, it's a big family. So we support each other. So you feel as though you've got your brothers and sisters all around you. That's how great the theater is to me ... I just grew because I was given extraordinary roles to do. I never took any of it for granted.\n\"And when you're doing a show, you don't really think about the audience that much. You really think about doing the show. And then when you're in front of an audience, suddenly this 'thing' happens. And (the audience) give us the kind of life that ... the play is supposed to have. And I just gradually grew. And how can you not be grateful for people like Dick Van Dyke and Ricardo Montalban and Donald O'Connor and Antonio Banderas?\"\nTV viewers will be tricked and treated to a tomb-full of Halloween specials this year. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are conjuring the next version of \"The Evil Dead\" on Starz Halloween night with its 10-part series \"Ash vs. Evil.\" ... Sundance will feature a week of Stephen King favorites beginning Sunday and ending with \"The Shining\" on Oct. 31 ... John Ceallach thinks his family has been cursed by the Bell Witch. Armed with his best friend, he'll go in search of its origins (and perhaps its cure) on A&E starting next Monday ... Sideshow Bob finally does Bart in on Fox's the Simpsons' \"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\" Sunday ... Syfy sports a monthlong series of spooky movies including the original \"The Hollow\" on Oct. 28, in which three sisters find fear and loathing when they move in with their aunt ... Destination America will present America's first televised live exorcism on Oct. 30 at the house where the actual ritual of the film \"The Exorcist\" took place. Families have claimed the structure is haunted and a team of ghostbusters from Destination America will search every nook and cranny for that evil spirit ... At last something you can sink your teeth into with the real skinny on vampires via PBS' \"Secrets of the Dead\" with its \"True Origins of the Vampire Legend,\" airing Oct. 27.\nOne of the best new shows this fall is CBS' \"Supergirl,\" who flies into her premiere night next Monday and lands in her regular slot Nov. 2. It stars newcomer Melissa Benoist as the re-imagined power puff.\nGeoff Johns, chief creative officer for DC Entertainment, explains why this Supergirl is so well, super. \"The most powerful element of Supergirl is the emotional one, is that she was the cousin of Superman and sent here on Earth to watch over him. And her rocket got detoured, and she arrived here, and the job that she was sent here for no longer existed.\n\"And the fact that she was a young child but has a memory of Krypton, unlike her cousin, it makes it much more painful. And she is an underdog character. She has a lot more to go through than even Clark Kent did adjusting to Earth ... Whenever you look at all these different versions, because there's hundreds and hundreds of comic books, ... you can't just say, 'We're going to make the cape this long because it's this long in the comics.' You've got to look at the character and the emotional reality of the character and where that resonates the most to people. And that is the most important thing when you're reinventing a character like this.\"\n(Luaine Lee is a California-based correspondent who covers entertainment for Tribune News Service.)\n(c)2015 Luaine Lee\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740251&h=FBI+profiler+Candice+DeLong+talks+the+Unabomber+and+other+evils", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740251", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1740251&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:19:26.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
