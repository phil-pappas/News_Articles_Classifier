This morning I had breast cancer.\"\nA second picture shows her smiling brightly with another board which reads: \"This evening I don't!\"\nDerbyshire, a former presenter on Newsnight and BBC Radio 5 Live, underwent reconstructive surgery following her operation and on Friday praised her surgeon as \"awesome, kind, clever, very very good at his job. And his whole team\".\nAnd she said she made her diary to help other women in a similar position to her, the Daily Telegraph said.\nIn the footage, Derbyshire says: \"The reason I wanted to talk about what has happened to me is that I am a pretty open person. But also because more than one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer. And here's the thing: having cancer is manageable.\n\"Having a mastectomy is totally do-able. I didn't know that until I got cancer. And that's what I want to tell people. I know everyone is different, and has different experiences. This is mine. And I hope you don't mind me sharing that with you.\"\nShare article Derbyshire will be back at work full-time from October 20, but will have time off for further treatment.\nThe diary will be shown during The Victoria Derbyshire Show from 9.15am on BBC 2.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:38:46.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
