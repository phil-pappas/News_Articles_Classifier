The superstars in both bands are having on-going discussions for what was said as a \"VERY exciting\" live show. \"The Spice Girls tour has been this idea bouncing around for the past year and a half, and it's something we're still talking about,\" AJ McClean has been quoted as telling the Daily Star (via Mirror Online). A source, meanwhile, added, \"America had a different relationship with the Spice Girls. They were big but their success didn't last quite as long, so teaming with another act is a way of booking bigger venues.\" Early last month, Geri Halliwell a.k.a. Ginger Spice confirmed that plans for Spice Girls to reunite have been discussed . \"It's one of those things that's been discussed, but until it's concrete I wouldn't announce it,\" so she said. \"I think it would be nice to celebrate it in some way. I can say that there's been talks! I think that's fair and honest.\" Fellow member Melanie Brown , meanwhile, recently confirmed that Victoria Adams aka Posh Spice would have to be involved for any kind of comeback. \"[Victoria] is my friend, I love her to pieces. If we do something, it has to be all of us,\" she stated. \"That's the whole point. As soon as there's something to actually announce, I'll be yelling it from the rooftops!\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:10.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
