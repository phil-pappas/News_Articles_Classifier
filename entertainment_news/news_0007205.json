Yet after Cutler threw a pair of touchdown passes in the final 4 minutes at Arrowhead Stadium, coach John Fox made it known he has been thoroughly impressed with the quarterback's approach since the spring.\n\"I've gotten a lot of questions on that guy since I got here,\" Fox said. \"And I couldn't be more pleased or impressed with how he's handled himself. Forget about (Sunday) and last week and the week before that. It's been since we've been here.\"\nWith an offense that has been ravaged by injuries, Cutler's toughness has been obvious and heartening over the last two games. After suffering a significant hamstring strain in a Week 2 loss to the Cardinals, Cutler missed only one game. And leading an offense that's been short-handed both at receiver and on the offensive line, Cutler has produced comeback victories over the Raiders and the Chiefs.\nOn Monday, Fox again praised the quarterback's drive.\n\"We're here to get players better and we expect our players to be receptive and do the things we ask,\" Fox said. \"And from the very beginning, as far as learning the offensive system and (understanding) some of the accountability it takes at the quarterback position, he's been all in.\"\nRodgers done for season: Running back Jacquizz Rodgers was placed on injured reserve Monday after he suffered a fractured right arm while on the punt return team against the Chiefs. Rodgers signed a one-year deal with the Bears this spring, targeted as a backup running back and a core special teams contributor.\n\"He's a guy who probably surpassed our expectations and contributed on the field whether it was on offense or in the kicking game,\" Fox said. \"He's a guy who will be missed.\"\nRodgers' season-ending injury should open the door for rookie Jeremy Langford to see more work out of the backfield. The Bears also signed veteran running back Antone Smith on Monday to fill Rodgers' roster spot.\nSmith had been with the Falcons for parts of seven seasons but was released with an injury settlement in September after injuring a hamstring during the preseason.\nNext man up: Fox had no additional updates Monday on injured linebacker Shea McClellin, who left Sunday's game in the second half with a left knee injury. Sources indicated McClellin did not suffer an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament. But a timetable for his return remains unclear.\nLaRoy Reynolds replaced McClellin on Sunday, seeing his first action on defense for the Bears after joining the team Sept. 29. Reynolds was released by the Jaguars in Week 3.\ndwiederer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @danwiederer\nPrivacy Policy John Fox Jay Cutler Chicago Bears Kansas City Chiefs Shea McClellin Jacquizz Rodgers", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c4c6f/turbine/ct-jay-cutler-john-fox-bits-spt-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:25:40.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
