Infrastruktur by Turner Prize nominee Nicole Wermers (Andy Milligan/PA) \nInfrastruktur features a series of chairs with expensive fur coats hanging over the back. It may look like a living room during a party but those “in the know” say it “exposes the way that we as a society… have been reduced to making judgements on commercial aesthetics”. \nThen there’s Camplin’s The Military Industrial Complex. It sounds scary but turns out to be a study room “drawing from physics, philosophy, psychology, witchcraft, quantum theory and warfare” on issues around mental health. A visitor views The Military Industrial Complex by Bonnie Camplin (Andy Milligan/PA) \nThe exhibition includes large TVs – playing conspiracy theories on loop – books and a photocopier spread across a room. \nLiving art is also involved, with Kerbel nominated for her operatic performance work Doug, made up of nine songs sung by six voices. The first visitors watch a performance of Doug by Janice Kerbel (Andy Milligan/PA) \nBut the favourite for the award is Assemble, who have moved a housing estate workshop from Liverpool to Glasgow for their exhibition. \nThe group were nominated for work to transform part of the Toxteth estate – Granby Four Streets – which fell into disrepair after riots over 20 years ago. Members of Assemble sit inside their exhibit (Andy Milligan/PA) \nResidents fought plans for demolition and Assemble were invited to help locals regenerate the housing and public spaces “from the ground up”. \nVisitors to the Assemble exhibition can buy the goods on display as the group use the Turner Prize to start a social enterprise and fund further regeneration in Toxteth. Assemble have moved their workshop from Liverpool to Glasgow (Andy Milligan/PA) Share article \nThe exhibition is running in Glasgow’s Tramway, with the winner of the prestigious £25,000 prize to be announced in December.
