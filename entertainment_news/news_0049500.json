January 1st 1970 46 years ago /video/video.news.com.au/Lifestyle/ Face-palm ... Malcolm Turnbull naturally wanted to boast about meeting a Hemsworth brother, but he made a mistake doing it. Lanai Scarr News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nMALCOLM Turnbull might be trying to be Australia’s “cool” PM but even the seemingly hip politician isn’t quite as up to date with pop culture as he thinks. \nThe newly appointed Prime Minister met Australian heart-throb Chris Hemsworth — aka Thor — at the AFL grand final in Melbourne on Saturday and naturally took to social media to boast about the experience. \nBut in a totally awkward moment Mr Turnbull, former Communications Minister, seemed to mistake the identity of his new celebrity pal. \n“Good to meet Liam Hemsworth today - talked about the contribution of the creative sector to our economy. But a bit weird he insisted on me calling him Thor,” Mr Turnbull originally posted on his official Facebook at 3.24pm. Oops ... The above screenshot shows the original post confusing Chris Hemsworth for little brother Liam was edited. Picture: Facebook \nThe commentary was posted alongside a picture of the pair smiling at the official grand final function. \nBut just two minutes later Mr Turnbull either realised his mistake or had it pointed out to him that he actually wasn’t with Liam, but instead with the older Chris Hemsworth. \nThe Prime Minister quickly edited his post to change Liam to Chris. But on Facebook, edits are visible to all and Mr Turnbull’s faux pas had already been marked in time. \nLiam Hemsworth is the younger brother of Chris and has appeared in several Hollywood movies, including most notably The Hunger Games franchise alongside Jennifer Lawrence. \nChris Hemsworth is arguably an even bigger Hollywood star who is most notably the face of Thor . \nGood to meet Chris Hemsworth today - talked about the contribution of the creative sector to our economy. But a bit weird he insisted on me calling him Thor Posted by Malcolm Turnbull on Friday, 2 October 2015 \nMr Turnbull was said to spend most of his time at the grand final at the official function inside the Melbourne Cricket Club members pavilion meeting with celebrities and VIPs. \nThe Prime Minister has not yet commented on if he felt a little more than awkward about naming the wrong famous Hemsworth brother. \nNews Corp Australia has contacted the Prime Minister’s office for a response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:48:41.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
