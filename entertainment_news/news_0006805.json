(PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nAccording to the CDC, autism affects 1 in 68 individuals under 21 living in the U.S. Of those individuals, 10 percent demonstrate savant abilities, or extraordinary skills not exhibited by most persons.\nAuthor Joyce Yexley’s daughter, Amy, had total brain damage from a severe stroke at birth. Her doctors anticipated she would be blind, deaf, and multiply handicapped. Amazingly, at 32 months Amy heard a song and played it on a piano in therapy class. From then on, though she couldn’t read or write, she would play the organ for hours on end.\n32 years later, Amy was officially diagnosed as a savant, one of only about 300 in the world. To bring understanding and awareness to this phenomenon, Yexley has recently released her new inspirational nonfiction, “Not My Plan,” which captures both the challenges and joys of raising a child with special needs, specifically savant autism.\nDrawing from her own personal journey, Yexley provides advice for other caretaking parents on how to overcome grief, attain happiness and find greatness in extraordinary children. Readers will learn more about Amy’s incredible gift and rare condition that continue to bring joy and comfort to her family.\n“’Not My Plan’ shares the journey of a heartbroken mother struggling with her fears while trying to overcome her grief of having a child with special needs,” Yexley said. “Although I prayed for endless miracles for my daughter, God healed my heartache and filled me with unconditional love to live a life of joy with their extraordinary daughter.”\nFor more information visit http://www.joycesjourney.com .\n“Not My Plan” by Joyce Yexley\nHardcover, $28.95\nPaperback, $11.95\ne-Book, $5.99\nISBN: 978-1-51270-692-5\nAvailable at amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com and bookstore.westbowpress.com\nAbout the author\nJoyce Yexley is a fashion historian, writer and speaker.
