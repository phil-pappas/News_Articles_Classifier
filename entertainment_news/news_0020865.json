Jimmy Winfrey, who is an associate of Young Thug, is currently awaiting trial for the incident. Like Us on Facebook \nAccording to TMZ , Winfrey's lawyers acknowledge rivalries in the rap game, but that does not mean nyone wants to truly hurt one another, taking their example a step further comparing Wayne and Young Thug to Saints QB, Drew Brees and Falcons QB, Matt Ryan. \n\"Clearly, the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons are rivals because they are fighting every year to win the same division: the NFC South. Yet, this does not provide a motive for Drew Brees to kill or maim Matt Ryan.\" \nThe lawyers also claim Young Thug idolizes Lil Wayne which is not too hard to believe since he went on record with GQ Magazine and gushed about the CEO of YMCMB. \nFirst GQ asks if he tried to kill Wayne to which he replies no and explains he's always looked up to the new Orleans native, even if he has been dissed publicly by him before. In fact it does not phase him. \n\"Maybe if I was a peasant it would. But of course it bothers me some, because that's what I always wanted. It was so weird: I always wanted to be in the studio with Wayne. I would tell Birdman to bring him over, but he never f**king came. \nThug further adds, Weezy would rather be Young Thug at this point in his career. \n\"I feel like if he had the chance to be himself or me, he'd be me. If I had the chance to be myself or him, I'd be him. That man is the greatest. If we had the biggest problem in the world, I'd still say he's the best rapper in the f**king world. Everybody knows nobody raps better than the f**king boss.\" \nInteresting way of putting it over. \nThe Atlanta-based rapper also discusses his preference for wearing women's clothing. \"Because women's clothes are [slimmer] than men's clothes. The jeans I got on right now, they're women's jeans. But they fit how they're supposed to fit. Like a rock star. The only thing I probably have in men's is, like, briefs. T-shirts. Ninety percent of my clothes are women's.\" Contribute to this Story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:59:52.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
