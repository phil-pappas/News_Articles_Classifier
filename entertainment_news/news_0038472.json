Playboy — once considered racy, even obscene — has become a benign and perhaps even stuffy icon of an era when sex was ... well, sexy. \nWith explicit Internet sex available in a nearly infinite variety, Playboy decided skin — no matter how gorgeously photographed — was no longer paying the bills. More than a year ago, it banned full nudity on its website, and on Tuesday announced it would do the same for its U.S. print edition. This image released by Playboy shows Janet Pilgrim on the cover of the July 1955 issue of the gentleman's magazine. The magazine that helped usher in the sexual revolution in the 1950s and '60s by bringing nudity into America's living rooms announced this week that it will no longer run photos of completely naked women. Starting in March, 2016, Playboy's print edition will still feature women in provocative poses, but they will no longer be fully nude. (Playboy via AP) \nStill, generations of men fondly remember Playboy as a rite of passage. \n\nKen Williamson, 65, of Palmdale, California, remembers being busted around 1960 when he took a Playboy to class to read.

But when Williamson looked into class at lunchtime, \"the teacher was at her desk reading it,\" he recalled. \nThe magazine offered far more than just naked women.

(Playboy via AP) \n\"It was the epitome of male sophistication,\" Williamson said. \"This was in the era when (Hugh) Hefner was building the Playboy clubs. People joke that they only bought it for the articles, but they did have some interesting interviews.\" \nEdwin Sierra, 59, of Los Angeles, remembers Playboy as his first introduction to female nudity. He hid the magazine in his room but \"it wasn't sleazy at all,\" he said. \n\"It was kind of the celebration of a woman's body,\" he said. \"And it's the first time seeing it exposed as a kid, you go 'Wow! Man!'\" This image released by Playboy shows Barbi Benton on the cover of the July 1969 issue of the gentleman's magazine.

(Playboy via AP) \nLike the James Bond movies of the period, the magazine offered a glamorous view of a life full of voluptuous women, sophisticated clothing and fancy mansions, Sierra said. \n\"I learned a lot about (men's) fashion,\" he said. \"It always stays with me a little bit.\" \nPlus \"they had great cartoons,\" he said.

(Playboy via AP) \nAndrew Derkrikorian, 27, last looked at a Playboy magazine a decade ago. \n\"Even at that time, there was the Internet, so there was no reason to go out and buy it\" because the news articles and stories about celebrities were all available online, not to mention porn. \nSo why did he buy it? \n\"The girls,\" he said. The models all appeared to be natural rather than cosmetically enhanced, shot in beautiful or intricate settings. \n\"They were classier,\" he said. \"Besides just the nudity, there was a purpose behind every image.\" \n\"Compared to the girls in the photos today, that was art,\" he said. \"A lot of the girls that pose for photos on social media are a lot more skanky.\" \nBurlesque queen and Playboy cover girl Dita Von Teese agrees. \n\"I used to steal my dad's Playboys from underneath the bed, and it's where my obsession with garters and stockings comes from,\" she said in an email. \"Those sumptuous, glamorized, lingerie-clad pinups are part of what snowballed my career from pinup girl to burlesque star to lingerie designer!\" \n__", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:02:54.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
