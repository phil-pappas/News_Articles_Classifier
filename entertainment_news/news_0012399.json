Students showed us that we should not retreat when the tough gets going we must just keep pushing harder. That states can be defeated if we fight it together with common goals.\nI hope those who ran away because environment in their country was unbearable have learnt something from our brave children. I don't buy this argument that the regime is so cruel that it is difficult to face them. Apartheid regime was so worse than any regime in any country but youth in 1976 never retreated. South Africa is where it is now because they understood that the fight was not about their generation but about the changes for generation to come.\nThe current FEES MUST FALL campaign is not much about current students but more about the coming generation. An educated nation means a progressive country so our foreign nationals fighting a selfish and gruesome regime is done for the coming generation just soldier on and make the countries a better place for everyone and running away should not be an option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:27:48.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
