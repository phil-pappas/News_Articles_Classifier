Among the luxury items on display including high-end electronics, cars, the best of art and jewellery, will be elegant synthetic leather bags, leather-free shoes, cosmetics never tested on animals along with delectable dairy-free chocolates and vegan cookies, courtesy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Not only this, more than a dozen progressive companies including ASOS, Baggit, Veruschka, and GQP will also be showcasing their best under the theme 'ExtraVEGANza — Be classy without cruelty'.\nAt the expo that will see attendance of celebs like Kotha Janta actor Allu Sirish will support the campaign alongside the bunny mascot at the PETA stall on October 3 at 4 pm. Allu will pose with PETA's giant bunny mascot, who will be holding a sign reading, \"Be a caring consumer: Buy cruelty-free. Your coverage is invited\". Anyone who thinks that they have to steal an animal's skin to make a fashion statement or blind a rabbit to test eye shadow, is behind the times,\" says PETA India CEO Poorva Joshipura adding, \"Thanks to cruelty-free cosmetics, delicious vegan foods and stylish vegan clothing, shoes and bags — which are readily available just about anywhere you shop. Going vegan and enjoying the finer things in life can go hand in hand.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:19:08.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
