Sunshine ACE Hardware Announces Launch Party for New CPR Assistance Tool getpushing 4:18 PM, Oct 13, 2015 \nOn Oct. 24, Sunshine ACE Hardware will host a launch party to showcase the first-of-its-kind CPR RSQ Assist device. With more than 1,000 people passing away each day due to cardiac arrest, the FDA-cleared tool makes it easier for users to perform life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Bystander CPR initiated before the arrival of first responders and with the aid of CPR RSQ Assist can triple cardiac arrest survival rates. The launch event will take place at all seven of the Sunshine ACE Hardware locations in Southwest Florida and each location will host a cookout. Community members are invited to attend the event from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Oct. 24 and will have the opportunity to see the CPR RSQ Assist device in action and purchase the device. The inventor of CPR RSQ Assist will be on-hand as will emergency medical services (EMS) staff to perform CPR demonstrations. \n“CPR RsQ Assist® is a tool that could drastically increase the rate of cardiac arrest survival in the United States,” said Dr. Robert Tober, medical director of Collier County, Florida, EMS and of CPR RsQ Assist Inc. “It is such an essential safety device, just like a fire extinguisher or smoke detector and Sunshine ACE Hardware is the first retail store in the United States to offer this product to consumers.” \nAccording to the American Heart Association, nine out of ten cases of sudden cardiac arrest will occur in the home, often with family and friends unsure of how to preserve life until paramedics arrive. The CPR RSQ Assist is equipped with an audio visual metronome that the guides the rescuer confidently through CPR techniques and keeping with the correct cadence of at least 100 chest compressions per minute for at least two minutes. \n“CPR RsQ Assist® simplifies the process of CPR for any individual, whether you’ve had CPR training or not,” stated Michael Wynn, president of Sunshine ACE Hardware. “With this product, a power to restore a heartbeat is in your hands. All they need to do is turn on the device and let it guide them through the rest. The CPR RSQ Assist device can be used over light clothing and does not require any mouth to mouth contact.” \nTo attend the event on Oct. 24, the public is invited to stop by any of the seven Sunshine ACE Hardware locations in Southwest Florida: \nDowntown Naples, 141 Tamiami Trail North, East Naples, 4433 Tamiami Trail East, Marco Island, 1720 San Marco Blvd., Golden Gate, 11673 Collier Blvd., Bonita Springs, 9100 Bonita Beach Road, San Carlos, 18911 Tamiami Trail South, Port Charlotte, 3035 Tamiami Trail \nCPR RsQ Assist® is FDA-cleared for use on people eight years and older. It is an essential safety tool to keep at home, in the workplace, in the car, or anywhere where there are two or more people. The device is also available with a custom-designed wall cabinet and signage for easy placement adjacent to an AED machine, so rescuers have easy access to both lifesaving devices. The current American Heart Association guidelines call for at least 100 chest compressions per minute for at least two minutes prior to using an AED machine.
