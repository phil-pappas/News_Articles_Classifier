Dave Billsborrow drinking beer from a dirty shoe. All class, mate. \nAt first glance it appears the guys are enjoying someone’s buck’s party, with the trio having a great old time partying up a storm in the small coastal town of Huskisson. But the rendezvous might be nothing more than a shameless publicity stunt to drum up interest in this week’s Bachelorette finale. \nThese are the first photos we’ve seen of 30-year-old construction manager Sasha since the show started, with fans speculating that the Bachelorette finalist had gone into hiding to deflect the attention away from himself as the show heats up.
