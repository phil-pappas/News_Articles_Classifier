News reports that Caitlyn Jenner has flown to Las Vegas to visit the former NBA star. Earlier this week she had been visiting her mother Esther, who was recovering after breaking both of her hips. Caitlyn joins Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney Kardashian and Kris and Kendall Jenner, who have all been seen visiting Lamar this week.\nMuch of the Kardashian-Jenner family has remained silent on the subject of Lamar's health, but on Wednesday, Kris posted an Instagram asking for prayers for him while Rob shared a photo of himself and Lamar. With the exception of those two and Kendall, who earlier this week tweeted \"please don't go,\" the rest of the group has stayed quiet. On Wednesday, reports surfaced that Khloé may still be legally married to Lamar, which could make her responsible for medical decisions.\n ​Follow Eliza on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/thompsonplaid", "http://www.eonline.com/news/706718/caitlyn-jenner-heading-to-las-vegas-to-be-with-lamar-odom-and-kardashian-family"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:36:01.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
