I have worked in various theatre productions across the US, including Jesus Christ Superstar and Hair (both Andrew Lloyd Webber productions).\nMusic runs in my family and in fact from an early age I took to tap dancing. I happened to go across to Paris for some holidays. Walking into a blues bar with some friends, I saw an amazing performance by Pascal Fouquet, the blues guitarist playing on stage. Pascal looked and saw this very free-spirited red-head bopping away. It was love at first sight and that was our a-ha moment â€” we both decided that they wanted to be together and make music together.\nYour brand of music\nOur music has been described as touching and refreshing with a bit of humor. Our originals bring the 40's and 50's blues and rhythm and blues into the present day. We create electric band blues in a roots blues format. The main difference between Electric Band Blues and Roots or Acoustic blues is the use of an amplified rhythm section. An acoustic guitarist holds the groove with his thumb, while soloing with the other fingers and an electric soloist can let go and fly on the support of the others' groove. Pascal Fouquet is an exceptional electric soloist, so I wanted to create a musical environment as a duo or trio that allows him to do both. We love connecting modern blues to the sounds from the 40's and 50's. The thing I love the most about this time period of Blues is the swing in the rhythm. In contemporary blues you hear a lot of 'rock' rhythm to the point where a lot of Blues fans think if it swings, it's jazz. So we for the most part stick to swinging with contemporary themed lyrics and a sound between the old and new.\nYour musical influences\nWe all have varied listening tastes, but some of the artists with whom we have a consonance are legends like T-Bone Walker and Big Mama Thornton to Ella Fitzgerald and BB King to Tom Waits and Kenny Burrell. I listen to Peggy Lee, Bonnie Riatt a lot.\nYour way forward\nAs a trio with Pascal, we have recorded three albums and it has been a very interesting journey. We are currently putting together material for our next album, and hopefully we shall hit the studio next year for its final master and release. Blues, though a small community in the overall music space, has travelled across the world to the most unlikeliest of places. So maybe we should be looking at options of exploring the sunny climes of this part of the world. Who knows we may end up making a whole load of new friends along the way.\nFor\nWATCH: Lil' Red & The Rooster - Trouble No More\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQ-cCp1co60"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T19:25:28.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
