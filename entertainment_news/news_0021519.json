These samples were from a leading private hospital. Post being admitted to JJ hospital last week Indrani was discharged on October 6.But Indrani, who is the main accused in Sheena Bora’s murder case has blatantly denied that she is addicted to drugs. \nWhen Indrani’s health condition worsened and she was her state was critical a high level probe was ordered. It was also speculated that Mukerjea tried to commit suicide by overdosing pills. Indrani’s state of medical health was critical and brought in unconscious to JJ hospital after excessive consumption of pills in the Byculla jail. \nThe toxin screening test revealed traces of amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine and THC (tetra hydro cannabin). As per the summary records, it states that Indrani was taking benzodiazepine for her anxiety issues. But later Indrani had told IG Bipin Kumar Singh that post September 26 she was not on medication, and she did not attempt suicide in jail. \nVinod Tawde had ordered a high-level probe into the case. It is now startling that the samples of urine now show traces of cocain as the additional chief secretary K P Bakshi confirmed that Indrani had never taken drugs or attempted suicide. Also Bakshi was informed by the J J hospital dean T P Lahane that they were preliminary findings and in the final investigations, the reports were negative. \n  10, 2015 10:06 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:20:43.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
