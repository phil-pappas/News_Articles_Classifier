The film's director, Cary Fukunaga, was asked by ABC Radio if he was surprised the first film from Netflix wasn't something a little lighter and more crowd-pleasing. \n\"Yeah, they definitely could have played it safe,\" Fukunaga says. \"But I don't think Netflix got to where it is by playing it safe.\" \nFukunaga won an Emmy for directing the first season of True Detective , and he's been trying to make this movie for over a decade. \n\"It's just important to not waste time doing frivolous things, I think,\" Fukunaga says. \"Especially, making movies is so difficult, and you spend so many years of your life doing it, you should at least be trying to say something.\" \nAside from its Netflix debut, Beasts of No Nation is also in select theaters Friday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
