A Steve Goodman Songbook” by Elaine St. George and “Seth Avett & Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith” are fine examples of the sheer primal power of the human voice, singing words that mean something. Comment By Jay N. MillerFor The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 9, 2015 @ 7:00 am While our planned music interview this week is still AWOL, let’s look at two extraordinary albums that quite likely slipped through the cracks of the top 10 charts. Both these records are potent, but neither one has the slightest hint of overproduction or auto-tuning, just stripped down arrangements and the sheer primal power of the human voice, singing words that mean something. Those qualities might be a bit rare in today’s music scene, which makes these CDs so valuable. “Don’t You Know Me? A Steve Goodman Songbook” By Elaine St. George Among the most intriguing American songwriters of the past century, Chicago’s Steve Goodman surely occupies a special place. With a style that easily straddled folk, country, and blues, Goodman, who died of leukemia in 1984, at the age of 36, would have been a poster boy for today’s Americana category. We can still recall our joy, spending a week in Chicago some years ago, when we found Goodman’s music on local jukeboxes in the Windy City. But what makes Goodman memorable and noteworthy all these years later is his trenchant views of the human condition, liberally spiced with humor, often of the self-deprecating variety. One of his best-known, and most loved tunes is “A Dying Cub Fan’s Last Request,” bemoaning his favorite ballclub’s cellar-dwelling seasons. So, as embedded Red Sox alums Theo Epstein, Jon Lester and David Ross lead today’s Cubbies into the postseason this week, let’s have a new listen to Goodman’s music. “Don’t You Know Me?” is the new album by New York City jazz singer Elaine St. George, a line taken from Goodman’s best known song, and biggest seller, “City of New Orleans,” the train song that became a big hit for Arlo Guthrie in 1972. The album is subtitled “A Steve Goodman Songbook,” and it is certainly a fine cross-section (even without that emblematic Cubs tune). But the striking thing is that St. George and her backing quintet deliver the songs as jazz tunes, not losing their rustic flavor, maintaining their acoustic foundations, but simply treating them as the musical treasures they are. And the singer’s articulation is a big bonus, as St. George effortlessly enunciates every line so that the wit and poignance of Goodman’s writing comes through loud and clear. And she also adds her own interpretative gifts, so even old time Goodman fans will hear these songs in a new and wonderfully vibrant way. In many places St. George’s vocal approach neatly encompasses both folk and jazz. “Between the Lines” has Goodman ruminating on life in general, although with a large dose of humor, and it is a terrific way to start the album. “Old Fashion” depicts the proudly anachronistic fellow, who’s perhaps continually surprised at how fast he becomes out-of-date. One of the most enjoyable numbers here is “The I Don’t Know Where I’m Going (But I’m Going Nowhere In a Hurry) Blues,” a delightful piano romp where Ross Patterson’s piano lines encourage St. George to ham it up a bit, and even an outdated jibe at President Nixon works as a laugh line. But “The Dutchman” changes the tone entirely, presenting a serious, even stately song about a couple in love, and sympathetically detailing their years together. But then it’s back to fun, as “Somebody Else’s Trouble” is the buoyant ode to being able to shrug off our own woes – as long as someone else has worse. Jaunty lines like “As long as fate is out there busting somebody else’s ... bubble, everything will be alright.” (And whether or not St. George was the first to insert that pregnant pause before “bubble,” it’s a neat extra laugh.) “Chicken Cordon Bleus” is the comical lament of someone who’s not sure, in the wake of a broken romance, if his heart or his stomach is more upset. Of course “City of New Orleans” gets a memorable rendition, a finger-popping swinging take, where Adam Armstrong’s throbbing acoustic bass drives the locomotive. And once again, St. George’s careful articulation makes you appreciate the loving detail in Goodman’s lyrics. Goodman’s heart is on his sleeve in “I Just Keep Falling In Love,” and hearing St. George’s exquisite version, you wonder why some of today’s pop stars haven’t revived this lovely tune. “Video Tape” suggests we might all live more prudently if we had to see a replay, and St. George sings it as wistful, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but also somewhat regretful. Patterson’s rollicking piano drives the infectiously exuberant “You’re the Girl I Love.” “The Ballad of Penny Evans” is Goodman’s tale of a Vietnam War widow, and heartbreaking enough in his version, but St. George does an a capella rendition here that is just incredibly powerful. The album ends with a cover of Goodman contemporary John Prine’s “Souvenirs,” a sweetly acoustic look at the passage of time. “I sing Steve’s music because it deserves to be heard,” St. George says in the liner notes, and for old fans or new generations, her superb album should insure that it will be. “Seth Avett & Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith” (Ramseur Records) Among the many interesting side projects the Avett Brothers do between their own tours, this CD, released back in March, is one of the more arresting. The late Elliott Smith was one of the most original alt-rock songwriters of the 1990s and beyond, known for his mostly melancholy, but emotionally resonant and highly literate songs. The two singers here work with a quartet, including Scott Avett on banjo, and Avett Brothers Band regular Joe Kwon on cello, along with Paul Defiglia on bass, and Tania Elizabeth on violin and viola. Recorded over three years when the principals’ own tours allowed, this album finds them harmonizing nicely, and mostly alternating lead vocals on the dozen tunes. To say they bring new life to Smith’s work would be an understatement. Mayfield has the lead on the melodic but slight “Between the Bars,” with Seth Avett coming in on choruses, while it is almost the opposite on the jaunty “Baby Britain.” Mayfield sings the haunting lead on “Fond Farewell,” where acoustic guitar and Seth Avett’s background vocals enhance the spooky ambiance of what is apparently about an opiate addict. There’s a subtle rock drive to “Somebody That I Used to Know,” with Seth Avett singing lead, and Mayfield’s fragile harmonizing and alternating lines adding layers of hurt. If anyone ever doubted Seth Avett’s vast vocal skills, one listen to the dreamy ballad “Let’s Get Lost” should convince them, and again Mayfield’s sweet harmonies are the perfect enhancement. “Twilight” might be the most beautiful piano/fiddle melody we’ve heard this year, and Mayfield’s lead vocal, all plaintive yearning, is extraordinary, while Avett supplies the harmony that elevates it to heavenly levels. Simple lines like “you’re wonderful, you’re beautiful, but I’m already somebody’s baby...” become unforgettable in this lovely tune. It’s an ineffably world-weary Mayfield singing “Angel in the Snow,” while the acoustic guitar accompaniment is subtly amazing. Seth Avett sings the lead on the whispery “Pitseleh,” while his brother adds finger-picked banjo, and Mayfield provides background vocals so tightly woven into his lead that she could be his shadow. The acoustic guitar work is fabulous on the surreal “Angeles,” and the palpable pain in the story of isolation on “Memory Lane” has both singers crafting an indelible interpretation of Smith’s song. “Roman Candle” is intriguing, the most muscular, rocking tune of the album , yet also presenting one of Mayfield’s most ethereal vocals, but like most of this CD, that unlikely juxtaposition is utterly compelling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:45:55.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
