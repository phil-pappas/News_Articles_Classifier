Once it is noted by the hawk-eyed netizens, there’s no stopping the sharing because the magic of taking a screen shot does not leave a lot of room for forgiveness if big companies drop the ball on such big announcements. \nThe Microsoft Lumia 950 XL and the Microsoft Lumia 950 sounds suspiciously like the Satya Nadella-led company is following the path paved by their Cupertino-based competitors. Apple iPhone 6 and Apple iPhone 6S is launched and not even a few months later Microsoft ‘leaks’ their flagship which is basically explaining that one variant title XL will most probably be slightly larger. \nThere is no topic of speculation because the screen shot that The Verge has shared shows that the Lumia 950 XL will sport a 5.7-inch screen while the Lumia 950 will come with a 5.2-inch screen. All other features remain the same which are a Windows 10 OS, 20-megapixel camera with ZEISS Optics, 32 GB of internal storage and the option of expanding memory via a MicroSD card supportable up to 2 TB. \nThe colour options that the screenshot reveals is that the back panel will at lest be available in white and black. The image also reveals that the Microsoft logo will be placed on the back panel slightly above the geometric mid-point on the back and the device will also come with an LED flash. With the advent of the LG Nexus 5X and the Huawei Nexus 6P , we hope the Lumia 950 XL and the Lumia 950 will also feature a Type-C USB connector which is reversible like the Apple Lightning Connector so you don’ t need to worry if you are plugging the USB port the right way up. \n  3:57 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:50:57.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
