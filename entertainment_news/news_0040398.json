It was inspired by their collaboration on the CD \"Love Has Come for You.\" \nSet in the South in the 1920s and 1940s, the show is about a woman who befriends a soldier just home from World War II. The show had its premiere in San Diego in 2014 and this winter has a run at the Kennedy Center. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:19:25.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
