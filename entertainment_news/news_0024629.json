Related Items Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nBEN Affleck and Jennifer Garner are selling their former marital home for about $45 million following their split in June. \nThe Oscar winner, 43, and the Dallas Buyers Club actress, who announced their split in June after 10 years of marriage, have reportedly quietly hired one of the top property brokers in Los Angeles to oversee the sale of their Pacific Palisades compound. \nPlatinum Triangle real estate insider Peter Propertyseller told Variety magazine that media mogul Lachlan Murdoch recently viewed the house, which boasts five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and sits on more than three acres, but did not make an offer. \nThe former couple, who have three children, Violet, nine, Seraphina, six, and Samuel, three, together, purchased the property for $17.55 million in March 2009, but have made extensive renovations since then. \nThe estate also features a swimming pool, basketball court, canyon-view terrace and a luxurious guest-house that has two bedrooms and three bathrooms, an entertainment lounge and state-of-the-art cinema. \nThe pair were originally planning to live in separate homes in the compound for the sake of their children, but Gone Girl star Ben moved into a rental home close by after they returned from spending the summer in Atlanta, Georgia, where Jennifer, 43, was shooting the upcoming film Miracles from Heaven. ben affleck", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:23:57.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
