(Photo: Todd Plitt)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Hold on,” Soledad O’Brien says. “I have to kiss somebody.”\nThe phone line goes silent a brief moment, then she returns with commotion in the background. “One of my Scholars is ready to head out,” she explains.\nIt’s just another action-packed day in the life of this award-winning journalist, producer and philanthropist. With her children at camp, O’Brien, 49, has more time to focus on her two-year-old company, Starfish Media Group, and her foundation, the Starfish Scholar Program. Every year, the philanthropic venture helps 25 disadvantaged young women complete their college education and begin careers. The foundation’s motto is “Transforming Lives — One Girl at a Time.”\nUp at 5:30 a.m. and in the hair and make-up chair by 6, O’Brien has spent the whole day doing foundation business, including interviewing Mindy Grossman, CEO of the Home Shopping Network, in front of an audience of Scholars. Now it’s 7 p.m., and these young women have congregated in her New York apartment for dinner.\nSoledad O'Brien, Chairman of Starfish Media Group, at her New York City offices on July 23, 2015.

That’s what time gives us.”\nShe uses herself as an example, referring to her time as a co-host of CNN’s American Morning show. “When they decided to take me off the morning show, instead of freaking out, I was prepared. I’d spent some time thinking what I’d like to do if (anchoring) went away. I said, ‘I want to make documentaries.’\n“My boss at the time said, ‘Are you going to cry?’ I said, ‘You just told me you were giving me a great opportunity to go do documentaries. Why would I cry?’ Everything he expected of me I didn’t deliver because I had my act together. I think crying is feeling powerless, and I didn’t feel powerless.”\nCNN's morning news anchors Soledad O'Brien and Bill Hemmer. (Photo: CNN)\nO’Brien’s mid-life career change prepared her to launch her own media company. Her former employer, CNN, became one of her early clients, as did HBO and Al Jazeera America. Now she is in a position to help shape the news, not simply cover it.\nAs a documentary-maker, O’Brien is attracted to personal stories, particularly those dealing with issues around ethnicity. Her father, Edward, an Australian of Irish descent, was a mechanical engineering professor. Her mother, Estella, an Afro-Cuban, was a French and English teacher. The couple met at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1958.\n“Interracial marriage was illegal in Maryland,” O’Brien says. “On their very first date no one would serve them in a restaurant, so my mom took my dad back to her apartment. She told us what it was like in the early 1960s to be an interracial couple with interracial children.\n“She said, ‘You can love your country and also work toward making things better for people.’ I’ve had so many opportunities to tell stories about different ethnicities, great stories in communities often overlooked. We want to tell stories that a lot of people just ignored.”\nO’Brien’s next focus will be income inequality. “A lot of the issues we see — Ferguson, race, gender — are about the disparity in wages and in wealth,” she says. “I remember some years ago pitching a documentary that looked at this growing gap between those who have and those who do not have, and people basically rushed me out of the room saying, ‘No one wants to see that.’ Today it’s part of the conversation. If you’re a middle-class family, how do you afford to send your kids to college, pay the mortgage and save for retirement? It’s virtually impossible.”\nO’Brien grew up in a middle-class family, the fifth of six children. She went to Harvard University, as did every one of her siblings. “My parents gave us a lot of support and showed us what was possible. … They taught us how to advocate for ourselves, and that’s what I’m trying to teach our Scholars and my own kids.”\nIt’s clear O’Brien has big ideas on how to improve the world around us. Would she ever consider running for public office? The very idea sends her into hysterics.\n“Never, ever, ever!” she says, then shouts to her dinner guests: “Hey, ladies! I’m running for the presidency!” A chorus of laughs ensues.\n“I’m not a big fan of politicians or politics as a medium in which you can get things done,” O’Brien says. “I think I can make a difference in a different way.”\nFind more great articles like this in Modern Woman magazine, on newsstands now through Nov. 28.
