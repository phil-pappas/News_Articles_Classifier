The Latin GRAMMY® award winning singer has released 37 albums, including her most recent release titled \"Pa' Que Sientas Lo Que Siento\" ( \"So You Feel What I Feel\" ) recorded with the all-female mariachi powerhouse, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles .\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275187\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275188\n\"Pa' Que Sientas Lo Que Siento\" features 11 tracks, including a powerful duet with Mexican singer Lila Downs titled \"No Me Amenaces\" ( \"Don't Threaten Me\" ), a passionate declaration of female independence. Determined to rescue mariachi music and preserve its righteous place in Mexico's musical history, \"Pa' Que Sientas Lo Que Siento\" marks Cuevas' return to the traditional school of mariachi. The must-have record features a compilation of songs from Mexico's most endeared composers, including Jose Alfredo Jimenez , Tomas Mendez and Marcelo Salazar .\n\"This album is dedicated to all women, whom like me, have suffered, have triumphed, and have loved passionately,\" says Cuevas. Released this summer, \"Pa' Que Sientas Lo Que Siento\" received a 2015 Latin GRAMMY® nomination for Best Ranchero Album, marking Cuevas' fifth nomination for the prestigious award.\nTo commemorate her 40 th anniversary, Cuevas will embark on a nationwide U.S. tour next year. A first-rate stage show complete with Mexican folkloric dancers, multiple costume changes, and Cuevas' impeccable vocal range, the tour also highlights the world's premier female mariachi ensemble, Reyna de Los Angeles . The first mariachi tour in history to feature an all-female cast will include an explosive two-hour program featuring Cuevas' and Reyna's greatest hits as well as new musical numbers arranged by Los Angeles -based mariachi whiz, Jose Hernandez . In a tradition historically dominated by men, the tour uniquely offers the female perspective of the mariachi song performed with the highest passion and soul only women can deliver.\nLater this year, Cuevas and Reyna de Los Angeles return to Chicago on Saturday, November 14, 2015 at the historic Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University to benefit the Mariachi Heritage Foundation 's mariachi music education programs taught in Chicago Public Schools (CPS).\nTickets for the event begin at $35 and are available at the Auditorium Theatre Box Office (800-982-ARTS) and via Ticketmaster .\nBooking Contact:\nColumbia Artist Music Inc.\nTobias Tumarkin\n(212) 841-9563\nEmail\nMedia Contact:\nMariachi Heritage Foundation\nCesar Maldonado\n(312) 771-1088\nEmail\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mexican-singer-aida-cuevas-celebrates-40-years-of-mariachi-music-with-a-latin-grammy-nomination-and-an-all-female-us-tour-with-mariachi-reyna-de-los-angeles-300156468.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275188", "http://www.ticketmaster.com/", "http://www.auditoriumtheatre.org/shows/aida-cuevas-mariachi-reyna-de-los-angeles/", "http://www.liladowns.com/", "http://www.cami.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275187", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH23201&Transmission_Id=201510080835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH23201&DateId=20151008", "http://soldemexicomusic.com/", "http://reynadelosangelesmusic.com/", "http://www.mariachiheritagefoundation.org/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mexican-singer-aida-cuevas-celebrates-40-years-of-mariachi-music-with-a-latin-grammy-nomination-and-an-all-female-us-tour-with-mariachi-reyna-de-los-angeles-300156468.html", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291996", "http://www.aidacuevas.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:36:06.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
