He plans a mid-October opening of the 9,000-square-foot property opposite CityCenter and Aria, and it will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \nThe 6,700-square-foot Pete Rose Bar & Grill will be filled with art installations and historic pieces from Pete’s iconic baseball moments. The full bar seats 35, with another 250 seats in the dining room and 100 more on the Strip-side patio. \nSome 32 HD televisions will fill the restaurant offering 24/7 sports, analysis and action. The patio will let guests enjoy dining al fresco in a garden-like setting while taking in the sounds and sights of the Strip. \nPete’s menu, developed by HIG Management corporate executive chef Brian Littlejohn, will include appetizers, sandwiches, entrees and desserts, plus three signature Pete Rose Specials all using responsibly sourced ingredients. \nThose specials will honor the three cities in which Pete played: Cincinnati chili on spaghetti for the Cincinnati Reds; classic Philly cheesesteak for the Philadelphia Phillies; and a spin on poutine for the Montreal Expos topped with brown gravy and cheese curds. \n“I love sports, sports fans and great quality food,” said Pete, who now lives in Las Vegas. “Our restaurant location and my partnership with HIG Management allows me to bring all three together.” \nAfter Pete took a tour of the finishing touches being applied to the space on Tuesday, I talked with the baseball hero: \nThis is not your first rodeo in terms of a restaurant and sports bar? \nNo. I had two sports bars in Boca Raton in Boynton Beach, Fla., when I lived there in the 1990s. They were very successful and a lot of fun to be around. Actually, one of them was really good because I did a radio show nationally syndicated every night from 6 to 8 from the restaurant, so that really helped business. \nAnd hopefully you do the same here. \nWell, Robin, I’m partnered with HIG Management, and we’re going to open in the middle of October. Las Vegas is my home, and I know the people who come here are everyday Americans, people who love to get together with their family and friends cheering on their favorite teams. \nAt Pete Rose Bar & Grill, they’ll enjoy a great restaurant, a bar for people to get high-quality food and drinks in a laid-back atmosphere with plenty of TVs to watch the game. This restaurant is going to have my name on it, and with that comes a great responsibility to make sure that we deliver a great product, which HIG does, and to make this restaurant a part of their Las Vegas experience. \nIn saying that I intend on spending a lot of time here, I get off work at 4:30, and I work five minutes from the restaurant, and I’ll go to the restaurant three or four times a week and get my dinner and visit with people. Of course the HIG people not only deliver a nice sports bar, but also a high-quality restaurant with their responsibly sourced ingredients, their management and business. \nTheir only way is commitment to quality, which I like really like about these people. It’s going to sit right across from Aria, and our patio has an incredible view of the architecture of Aria, as well as being at one of the busiest intersections on the Strip. \nI don’t think I could ask for anything more as far as the location. The foot traffic, Robin, as you know on Las Vegas Boulevard is unbelievable. The foot traffic going by our restaurant is second to none as far as I’m concerned. \nPete, tell me about these three special meals. The Cincinnati chili on spaghetti, where did that invention come from? \nWell I was born in Cincinnati, and we were raised on Skyline Chili and Gold Star Chili, those are the two chili companies, and of course we were raised on Montgomery and Ribs, and we also had Graters Ice Cream. So everybody from Ohio knows about those three things. \nI used to do all the commercials for Gold Star Chili. We just tried to put something with chili on the menu and have it connected to Cincinnati because everybody from Cincinnati and Dayton and those areas back there are familiar with the chili, and we want them to feel at home when they come to Pete Rose Bar & Grill. \nWho invented the idea of putting chili on spaghetti, though? \nWhat we call that back in Cincinnati is you can have it a three way, a four way, or a five way, and you can put the chili, spaghetti, cheese, onions, whichever way you like it. I normally just get a three way, but I don’t like onions that much. These chefs are unbelievable, Robin, I mean they just come up with recipes. \nI sent them Queen City Sausage the other day, and we’re trying to come up with some recipes to use that sausage with or the hot dogs with bratwurst. We’ve got a lot of ideas for a lot of great food. I really have a lot of confidence in HIG chefs because they’re successful in the restaurant business, and this is just another one of their babies. 9 Group Troy Tulowitski, Evan Longoria, Barry Dakake and Pete Rose at N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms.

I’m pretty much a guy who eats everything, but I stay away from really spicy food because I have a tender stomach. But if you’re not really spicy, you’re going to go through my mouth. It’s just the way it is. \nAnd the Philly cheesesteak of course we know is the most famous dish of all. I think the Pope even tried it over the weekend in Philadelphia. \nI played five years in Philadelphia, and Philadelphia people have been raised on Philly steak and cheese, and everybody around the country has their own version. Our chefs have a great idea about how to make the Philly steak and cheese. \nWhat you want, Robin, I think you understand this, millions of people come here every year, and if you can have things that remind them of home as far as food is concerned, they’ll sit down and watch a sporting event and order a Philly steak and cheese, or order what we call back in Cincinnati a Coney Islander. \nThat’s all we try to do, is make people feel at home. Let’s compare our Philly steak and cheese with the one back in Philly, and a lot of people will love it. I believe most people will love it. \nPete, what memorabilia are you putting up in the restaurant? \nA lot of bats I used in a lot of All-Star games I played. We’ve got some trophies, we’ve got some silver bats to indicate the batting championships, a lot of pictures with different athletes in the different years I played, a lot of family pictures from back when I was a kid and my kids were kids. \nJust make it a real family situation. That’s what you try to create in a sports bar. We’ll have some trophies there for people to see. They’re doing a really good job of putting the inside together. \nAnd you’re opening just two weeks away, right? Mid-October? \nI think the 13th and 14th is our plan for a grand opening. I would say we’ll probably open just before that to get all the kinks out. I don’t think you ever close something down to get it ready when you’re on Las Vegas Boulevard. You just try to work around the people. \nTell me what the connection is with the restaurant and your Hustle for Heroes Foundation. \nI decided that some of my proceeds go to Hustle for Heroes because several months ago I was watching a program, and they started talking about how 22 veterans commit suicide a day. Twenty-two veterans in this country commit suicide a day. \nWounded Warriors does a great job, and I just decided to start my own foundation and call it Hustle for Heroes and help the guys who are coming home today and the guys who came home 20 year ago who are struggling. It’s just something that I’ve taken on because it’s unacceptable for me to think that 22 of our veterans commit suicide a day. \nThat’s mind-boggling. We’re just going to try to give as much money as we can and get as much help from the city people as we can to make this Hustle for Heroes second to Wounded Warriors. They do a great job. \nYou know in Great Britain, we don’t play baseball. I think the nearest it comes to is rounders. Why the American love affair with baseball? What’s the fascination with the sport? \nI think because of the time, it started in 1869 back in Cincinnati. The first night game was played in 1935, and I just think it has such a rich history. That’s why baseball cards are more valuable today than football cards or basketball cards or hockey cards. It will always be our nation’s pastime. \nI’m not going to sit here and tell you it’s the most popular sport in America. I don’t know that. Football is very popular, basketball is very popular, but baseball will always be our nation’s pastime because of the rich history with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and Ty Cobb and all the great players who played back in the teens and ’20s and ’30s. It’s apple pie, Chevrolet and baseball. \nThe sport of summer. \nYup. That’s another good thing about it. Baseball reminds you of going to games with your grandpa or going to play games with your dad. Back in Cincinnati, we used to have the first opening day every year for several years, and it brought a lot of tears to eyes because people remember going with their grandpa. They remember going with their dad. They remember going with their son. \nWhen I was a kid growing up, the Reds played the only game on opening day. No one else played in all of America. That was what they gave us because that’s where baseball started in 1869. \nSo this is an exciting moment for you being a Las Vegas resident. It cements your residency here. You’re now on the Strip full time. \nYou know, Robin, I’ve been working here for eight or nine years now, and I often wondered why there weren’t celebrity names on restaurants because all you want from a celebrity who has his name on a restaurant is to go there. I work here at least 20 days a month, so what does that mean? That means I have to eat 20 meals a night, 20 suppers a night. \nThere’s one restaurant, Jimmy Buffet, that’s been here forever, but it seems like in this town most of the celebrities who have these restaurants are chefs, which is understandable, too. I guess there’s just not enough celebrities who live here and spend enough time here as their hometown who go to restaurants on a nightly basis. \nI enjoy people, I enjoy good food, I enjoy seeing people relax and watching sports and having a good meal. I enjoy those kinds of things. Some people don’t want to hustle bustle being around people all the time. \nBut whether you’re working signing autographs at one of the memorabilia stores or on the radio and have people calling in, or whether you’re in a restaurant when you’re around them all day, I’m just a people person. \nI enjoy that kind of thing. You’re going to see a lot of me at my new restaurant. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
