the ones who'd sold millions of vinyl records and whom listeners thought they'd never see play live in a million years.\nUp to four decades on, some of those people were at Eatons Hill Function Centre on Thursday night, propping up the bar, ticking the bucket list, listening to Boney M among a few hundred enthusiastic others aged in their 40s, 50s and 60s.\nIn this case, they are listening in the knowledge of how famous the group had become.\nAdvertisement They hear Ma Baker, which was sampled by Lady Gaga in Poker Face , and Gotta Go Home, which made a cameo as a hook in Duck Sauce's 2010 house music hit Barbra Streisand .\nThey hear music that has stood a solid test of time and cynicism, which in the '70s sold about 159 million albums.\nAnd they hear a woman who at the height of her fame played before tens of thousands of people as a founding member of the group.\nMaizie Williams is 64, and she still belts out a mean tune as the one hook that prevents the modern Boney M from being a tribute band.\nSince breaking up in the mid-'80s, the name has become little more than a franchise - a revolving door for substitutes who help, in this case, a crowd of about 500 spend just over an hour reliving a youth of flared trousers, shared roll-your-owns, and mirror balls.\nKelly Rahman has been one of those substitutes for more than 10 years, and while he's a natural entertainer, his voice isn't quite the same as the deep tones of founding male vocalist Frank Farian.\nAnother former member, Bobby Farrell, freakishly died on the same day, in 2010, as Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin, who had inspired their hit track.\nRahman's silver glitter jacket, deep pink shirt and sunglasses set the scene for a night of flashbacks, most of them good.\nIf truth beckons, some of the set was a little \"cruise ship\" but the who's who of the QCWA in the front row of the standing-only mosh pit didn't seem to mind, nor did the bloke on the second tier who borrowed Peter Garrett's dance moves for his 50th birthday.\nA true highlight came from another stand-in, Samantha E Scott, whose rendition of Bob Marley original No Woman, No Cry was mystical, if not brilliant.\nRa Ra Rasputin , the song, had some '90s-style beats infused for a generational mash-up, and even the older members of the audience found it difficult not to appreciate the guest rapper who gave Brown Girl in the Ring a modern hip-hop beat.\nWilliams for half a song jumped off the stage to dance with the crowd, who she later thanked \"for keeping Boney M in business\".\nThe set wasn't long - just over an hour with a band break to allow the three women singers out of their mirror ball gowns and into their '70s tutu minis.\nBut it was wall-to-wall hits, music it could be argued that defined a generation and along with bands such as the Bee Gees owned the disco era.\nHats off to Williams who remains a star, and a courteous nod to those who propped up the bar, reminiscing how different eras of music had played such an important part in their lives.\nThe concert was the first in a national tour.\nThe setlist:\nSunny Daddy Cool Hooray!
