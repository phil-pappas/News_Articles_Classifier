Sir Michael Caine, Rachel Weisz and Harvey Keitel attending the premiere of Youth (Matt Crossick/PA) \nSpeaking at the film’s premiere in London’s Leicester Square, he said: “Never. No, if I retired I’d retire in England. But I wouldn’t retire anywhere. \n“But what happens is, you don’t retire from movies. Movies retire you. You suddenly don’t get any scripts, or there’s no money and they can’t afford you: then you stop.” \nSir Michael plays composer Fred Ballinger in the film by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino. Sent to a Swiss spa for his health with his best friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel), he is resisting attempts to revive his greatest works – while filmmaker Mick is desperate to make his comeback, featuring his former muse Brenda (Jane Fonda). Sir Michael says he will never retire from acting (Matt Crossick/PA) \nFred also has to contend with his family appearing on the scene – including daughter Lena Ballinger (Rachel Weisz). Her husband Julian (Ed Stoppard), who is also Mick’s son, has left her for pop star Paloma Faith. Promoted stories \nOn her cameo, Paloma, 35, said: “I’d like to do more acting. I find it a challenge, and I like being challenged. \n“But I’d like to do something a bit wittier and more hardcore, next time, where people don’t really even expect me to be that way. \n“I’m really into cinema, I’m a massive film buff, so I’d like to get my teeth into something that’s a bit alien to me. I’d love to do some sort of gritty British thing.” Paloma Faith makes a cameo in the film (Matt Crossick/PA) \nRachel, 45, said of working with Caine: “Michael’s a sweetheart, an absolute sweetheart, and he’s a living legend. He’s very funny and down to earth.” \nOn shooting in the village of Flims in Switzerland, she said: “It was off season, there was no snow. In fact the hotel was closed when we got there. It was a bit Shining-like, actually.” \nPaul Dano, 31, who plays spa guest Jimmy Tree in the film, said: “We were out there in the middle of nowhere, just each other. I’d get a glass of red wine with Michael after work and listen to him telling me stories.” Rachel described Sir Michael as “a sweetheart” (Matt Crossick/PA) \nPaolo confirmed that the role of Fred was written specifically for Caine. \nHe said: “I sent him the script. I told him the movie was written for him, and with that he agreed to do it.” \nSir Michael said: “When they said Paolo Sorrentino is sending you a script, I was amazed Paolo Sorrentino had even heard of me. And then they said: He wrote it for you! so it was a tremendous privilege.” Harvey Keitel stars alongside Sir Michael in the film (Matt Crossick/PA) Share article \n:: Youth will be released in cinemas later this year.
