Such books are often dripping with a fake you-can-do-it perkiness and shrouded in self-righteousness. \nPerhaps it is because she is a writer and her advice on writing is brilliant or perhaps it is because she is such a good writer that I simultaneously wanted to quickly turn the page to see what was next while savoring the advice on each page. \nGilbert is quite clear that the book is not intended solely for writers. But we all read from our vantage points, and that is mine. I felt as if she were the writing teacher I wished I had. \nAlmost each page contained excellent advice, but the main message is to believe in yourself and do it, to create even if no one is paying you for it, to create because that is what we are meant to do, if it calls to you. \nFrom the beginning, she explains that \"creative living\" does not require one to stop living the workaday life – unless, of course, you want to and can. \n\"I'm talking about living a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than fear.\" A few pages later, she adds: \"A creative life is an amplified life. It's an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life. Living in this manner – continually and stubbornly bringing forth the jewels that are hidden within you – is a fine art, in and of itself.\" A completely heartfelt, beautiful homage to the creative process, Elizabeth Gilbert's latest is a must read for anyone who loves to make anything. henry@henryhargreaves.com \nShe explains how she was an extremely sensitive child but she had a mom who did not brook fears and made her overcome many. Though she has conquered many fears, Gilbert, of Frenchtown, does not expect anyone to live without fear. \n\"Bravery means doing something scary. \"Fearlessness means not even understanding what the word scary means.\" Fear, she reasons, can protect and keep you alive, but it is not necessary to create. The magical thinking comes in when she talks about ideas. And those who need life to arrange itself like the ledgers of an anal retentive CPA might struggle with this concept. Yet it's a delightful one, one that has sustained her creative life. \n\"I believe that our planet is inhabited not only by animals and plants and bacteria and viruses, but also by ideas. Ideas are a disembodied energetic life-form. They are completely separate from us – albeit strangely. Ideas have no material body, but they do have consciousness, and they most certainly have will. Ideas are driven by a single impulse to be made manifest. And the only way an idea can be made manifest in our world is through collaboration with a human partner. It is only through a human's efforts that an idea can be escorted out of the ether and into the realm of the actual.\" Digest that for a while. Read that paragraph the way one (or at least I) read great philosophers, mulling over the idea. Let it sink in. Even if you don't quite grasp it, or on the surface roll your eyes, live with it. And stick with the book. \nFor Gilbert goes on to give excellent examples of what happens to creative people when they are receptive to ideas, when they tend their imaginations and what happens when they are closed. \nGilbert has been open and is aware when she was closed. She is also very honest about how she never expected writing to pay for living. She kept other jobs while writing, always writing. She was subservient to the art simply because she needed to do it. \n\"Most of my writing life, to be perfectly honest, is not freaky, old-timey, voodoo-style Big Magic. Most of my writing life consists of nothing more than unglamorous, disciplined labor. I sit at my desk and I work like a farmer, and that's how it gets done. Most of it is not fairy dust in the least.\" This need to create is not new; the earliest art found is 40,000 years old, she notes while the earliest signs of agriculture are only 10,000 years old. \nFor gardeners, painters, dancers and anyone who makes something where nothing was there before, there is a need, perhaps primal, that forces this creation. Without it, there is misery or at the very least, emptiness and darkness. \nAnd Gilbert is determined to guide you into the light.
