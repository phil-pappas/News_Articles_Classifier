He also was cited for making an improper lane change and driving with a suspended license.\nThe Broward state attorney's office filed the charges Wednesday. An arraignment hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27.\nJason Forman, Cassidy's lawyer, disputed police, saying his client provided his driver license and registration information before driving to a hospital to make a visit unrelated to the crash.\n\"There's certainly a lot of major inconsistencies in the report,\" Forman said Friday.\nCassidy, who crooned \"I Think I Love You\" and had a four-year run starring on television's \"The Partridge Family,\" has chalked up three DUI arrests since 2010 in Florida, New York and California.\nBut he wasn't suspected of using alcohol or drugs -- and wasn't tested for either -- when an officer caught up with him at Cleveland Clinic in Weston about 90 minutes after the daytime collision, police said.\nAccording to a Florida Highway Patrol report, a silver Kia Sportage was westbound on I-595 \"traveling at a high rate of speed, in and out of traffic\" when it changed lanes and sideswiped a 2013 International delivery truck.\nThe truck's driver, Pedro Vargas, 47, of Pembroke Pines, suffered minor injuries and was taken to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale.\nThe report described the Kia's driver as a clean-shaven \"older Caucasian male\" wearing blue jeans and a gray shirt.\nIt said he got out of his vehicle, \"attempted to cover (the Kia's) tag number then fled the scene in (the Kia) with a flat tire and right-side damage.\"\nA witness snapped a cellphone picture of the Kia's tag, which was used to link Cassidy to the vehicle. Police immediately issued a \"be on the lookout\" bulletin for the Kia and the driver.\nA Broward sheriff's deputy later spotted the damaged Kia parked near the Cleveland Clinic's entrance and found Cassidy on the fourth floor. It was later discovered that the 2014 Kia Sportage's registration had expired Aug. 31, 2014.\nThe police report lists Cassidy's current address as the Harbor Beach home that he recently put up for auction.\nCassidy, who is in the midst of a divorce from his wife Susan, filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, listing assets and liabilities at more than $1 million.\nA bankruptcy judge last month approved a $2 million bid on the five-bedroom waterfront home.\nCassidy was convicted of a drunken-driving charge after he was stopped on Florida's Turnpike in St. Lucie County in 2010. That was followed by an August 2013 arrest in upstate New York after Cassidy failed a roadside sobriety test.\nMost recently, Cassidy was reportedly arrested for another DUI in Los Angles and in March 2014 was sentenced to five years' probation.\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731853&h=David+Cassidy+charged+with+sideswiping+truck%2C+fleeing+scene", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731853&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731853"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:35:28.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
