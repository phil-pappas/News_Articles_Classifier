What’s the new “Empire” for everyone to obsess over?\nTurns out viewers are still buzzing about the “old” “Empire,” which in its second season continues to deliver juicy twists and ratings.\nThe new season hasn’t been a bust — precisely — but there haven’t been any breakout hits, either.\nWe’re deep enough into the fall season to call some winners and losers.\nNBC’s conspiracy thriller “Blindspot” and ABC’s spy drama “Quantico” have started strong and both won full season pickups.\nCBS’ “Limitless,” about a man who uses a mind-altering drug to solve crime, is probably next for a boost.\nABC’s “Dr. Ken,” with comedian Ken Jeong as the worst doctor next to “The Simpsons’ ” Nick Riviera, is inexplicably healthy.\nFox is bullish on its medical drama “Rosewood” and its comedies “Grandfathered,” starring John Stamos, and “The Grinder,” starring Rob Lowe. All three series have received additional script orders, a full season for “Rosewood,” six each for the sitcoms.\nBut Fox’s “Minority Report,” a sequel series of sorts to the blockbuster Tom Cruise film of the same name, is the odds-on favorite to be the first show canceled this season.\nThe network has already cut the season order from 13 to 10 episodes. Rather than make an official announcement, Fox might just run out the episodes and pretend the show never happened.\nIf the ratings get any more grim, CBS’ “Code Black” is going to have to call a code on itself. ABC’s old-school soap “Blood and Oil” with Don Johnson will be lucky if it lasts long enough for any of its plots to congeal. CW’s “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s” numbers aren’t worth the ink on a restraining order.\nAnd two of the most heavily promoted shows of the season — ABC’s “The Muppets” and Fox’s horror comedy “Scream Queens” — have underperformed and seem to be shedding viewers week to week.\nOf course, the overnight ratings don’t tell the full story. You have to factor in video on demand ratings. “Scream Queens’ ” premiere saw the best bump, growing from 4 million in the overnights to more than 7.3 million viewers after three days.\nAnd “Scream Queens” is a winner in one arena — social media.\nIt’s the one new show to score big on Twitter, coming in at No. 10 for all TV shows for the period ending Oct. 11.\nThe No. 1 show? That other Ryan Murphy thriller, FX’s “American Horror Story: Hotel.”\nCan a show be a loser before it premieres? CBS has pushed the much-hyped “Angel From Hell” with “Glee” alum Jane Lynch to February. The network says it will use the weeks to promote it even more — so we’ll all be sick of it before it even debuts, no doubt.\nThere is some good news, though, for the networks.\nThe midseason is just a couple of months away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:45:16.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
