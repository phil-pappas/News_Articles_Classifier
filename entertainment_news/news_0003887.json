Fading Frontier sees them coalesce around what is more or less their founding quartet for a suite of songs covering all the bases, from roiling indie-pop to trippy psychedelia and Big Star-style harmonising.\nShare article Guests include the British pair of Tim Gane and James Cargill of (respectively) Stereolab and Broadcast. Like Deerhunter, who lost an early member to a head injury caused by a skateboarding accident, both those bands have had members die. Meanwhile Deerhunter's frontman Bradford Cox was seriously injured late last year when he was hit by a car in Atlanta: he recounts the episode in the woozily beautiful Breaker and both death and the transience of life are themes he picks up elsewhere. Deerhunter certainly aren't iconoclasts – Cox has spoken in interviews of his reverence for bands like Stereolab, Sonic Youth and Radiohead – but they're clearly intent on cutting their own path.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-18T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:50:57.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
