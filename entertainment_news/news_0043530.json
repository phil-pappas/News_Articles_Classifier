New York has faced growing concerns about the potential of explosions and spills if trains hauling volatile crude oil were to derail. In May, the state Department of Environmental Conservation said it would develop individual geographic response plans for 20 counties that have the highest risks for a derailment.\nThe state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services said the foam trailers will be located in population centers along major rail lines and waterways, including in Buffalo, Kingston and Newburgh.\nThey will also be provided to fire departments in Binghamton, Elmira, Oneonta, Rochester and to Rockland County. They should be operational by early next year.\n\"This new equipment will help ensure first responders in these communities are prepared in the event of an emergency involving crude oil, or other highly flammable substances,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. \"Today's action is the latest in a multi-pronged effort to prepare state and local authorities in the event of a crude oil disaster.\"\nEach trailer has a foam concentrate that can be applied to roadways and oil by adding water.\nJSPECTOR@Gannett.com\nwww.twitter.com/gannettalbany", "external_links": ["https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/DriveTimes_and_Distances_PrePositioned_FoamTrailers_October-2015.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:25.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
