And Bogie isn’t the suave, cynical proprietor.\nAlso, I’d wager the food is better here than at Rick’s Place, and maybe the drinks, too. Because that’s just the way Cafe Nordo rolls.\nTHEATER REVIEW ‘Sauced’ By Terry Podgorski. Through Dec. 20 at Nordo’s Culinarium, 109 S. Main St., Seattle; $60-$99 with dinner (800-838-3006 or cafenordo.com ).\nThe idiosyncratic Pioneer Square dinner theater is encoring “Sauced,” a 2010 show set in a 1930 Seattle nightclub. And it has undergone significant menu and other revisions.\nMost Read Stories 5 ways CaliBurger is better than In-N-Out Seattle Seahawks fan: Why I'm flipping the switch and turning off my loyalties to this team Files for lawsuit against CIA stolen in 'suspicious' break-in at UW Seattle Mariners hire Scott Servais as manager, expected to name Tim Bogar bench coach Bill the Butcher workers still seeking CEO who vanished with their pay Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. There’s more glossy musical numbers, 1930s-style. And there’s dinner instead of just fancy bar snacks garnishing the mock-noir caper, written by Terry Podgorski and directed by Paul Budraitis.\nBut while half the cocktails are new concoctions, the somewhat befuddling plot still has the same basic ingredients: broads, booze, secret elixirs and hot liaisons. \nEncoring their 2010 roles, Mark Siano is again the brooding nightclub owner Mike, who has a thing for two formidable women. One is Opal Peachey’s Valerie, the no-nonsense co-owner of this boîte. The other is va-va-voom blond songbird Charlotte, played by Billie Wildrick as a cross between Marilyn Monroe and film noir she-devil Audrey Totter.\nRay Tagavilla is again Saul, the observant bartender-narrator, who now has a sidekick, the trumpet-playing lush Professor Dash (Evan Mosher).\nBetween campy scenes that signal a steamy triangular affair is reigniting, and that everyone’s after a coveted liquor recipe worth a fortune(?), there are enjoyable musical numbers backed by Annastasia Workman’s reliable combo. Top tunes: Wildrick’s potent rendition of Cole Porter’s “Love for Sale,” and Workman’s moody “The Violet Hour.” And for sheer campiness, Siano’s tonsil-scorching, lounge lizard version of the Bing Crosby ballad “Temptation.” \nNordo’s new brick-walled digs double neatly as a shady watering hole. But the acoustics are tough on Tagavilla’s low-voiced, rapid-fire delivery of hard-boiled dialogue and liquor-ology lectures. If the actor can adjust, the audience would get more of the lowdown.\nWhat makes “Sauced” most appetizing, along with smooth Murray Stenson-crafted cocktails like the Crumb Bum, is the revamped menu designed by Erin Brindley.\nOysters Rockefeller prepared two delicious ways? An exquisite entree, Quail and Chestnuts with Parsnip Gratin? They raise the bar for pub grub very high.\nMisha Berson: mberson@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:39:35.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
