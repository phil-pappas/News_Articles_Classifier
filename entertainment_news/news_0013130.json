In a 2012 interview with the magazine, Lamar said he relied on Khloe who promised to care for his children if anything were to happen to him. \"I think two to three weeks [into our relationship], she said, 'Lamar, you know what? Anything ever happens to you, I got your kids. They're always going to be all right.' That meant so much,\" Lamar told the magazine of his then-wife. \"She's a serious person and when she's down for you she's down for you.\" At the time of the interview, Lamar was let got from the Dallas Maverick. Khloe stood by him through the tough times and even pulled the plug on their reality series \"Khloe and Lamar\" to focus on their marriage. Lamar praised Khloe for her ability to be so caring, saying, \"She's just thorough. If she has your back she's going to follow you the whole way through. There's not a tough time or any situation that's going to deter her or turn her off from what you going through. If she has your back and she's down with you, she's down with you. I've experienced that time after time after time.\" \"We've only known each other two to three years but it seems like I've known her for my whole life,\" he continued. \"That's because of our bond. Her instinct ... it's maternal. So her ability to take in and to love unconditionally is something that you get from her.\" Khloe and Lamar are still legally husband and wife as a judge hasn't signed off on their divorce papers. The \" Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" star is in charge of making the medical decisions of Lamar. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:24:08.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
