The Bachelorette finalist Richie Strahan. Channel 10 Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nTHE Bachelorette favourite Richie Strahan is still looking for love after his elimination from the reality dating show. \nThe 30-year-old was one of just three remaining suitors vying for the heart of Sam Frost tonight. \nHis emotional exit, which saw Frost break down in tears during the rose ceremony, surprised many fans who had tipped him to win the show. \n\n— Lucy Hamilton (@LucyAHamilton) October 21, 2015 \n\"It was such an intense moment,\" Strahan told APN. \n\"I didn't know what to do at the time… I just stood there like a stunned mullet. \n\"Michael was standing there in front of her and I didn't want to ruin his moment, but all I wanted to do was give her a hug.\" \nThe Perth bachelor, who works as a rope access technician in the mining industry, said he's still single and hasn't started dating while the show has been on air. \n\"There's not a bevy of hot, attractive women at the places I go to (for work),\" he said. \n\"I've just been chilling out in Perth. I haven't really gone anywhere where I can meet someone. \n\"All my friends thought I'd won it, so I was constantly getting messages from the boys. It's been really tough to keep everyone in the dark.\" \nHe said tomorrow night's grand final could go either way, with both final men having strong qualities. \nFrost will introduce her two final suitors - real estate agent and soccer player Michael Strahan and construction manager Sasha Mielczarek - to her family on tomorrow night's grand final show before making her final decision. \n\"When I left the mansion I thought Michael had it in the bag because of the way Sam was looking at him,\" Strahan said. \n\"But after I've watched the show I think I'll be backing Sasha.\" \nThe Bachelorette grand final airs tomorrow night at 7.30pm on Channel 10. channel 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:01:52.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
