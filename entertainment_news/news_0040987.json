The Peoria Superhero and Kid's Villain Chase will be held on the Peoria Riverfront on Saturday with all proceeds going to United Way. All participants, kids and adults, are asked to dress up in their favorite superhero costume for the race. Registration begins at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Gateway Building. The costume judging contest commences at noon, with the 5K promptly starting at 1 p.m. The Kid's Villain Chase, for children 10 years old and younger, follows one hour later. The event is sponsored by Advanced Technology Services. Race registration costs $30 for adults and $20 for children.
