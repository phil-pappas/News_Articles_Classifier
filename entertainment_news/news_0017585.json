But in between, “Kansas City Choir Boy” is set adrift and crashes into a problematic performance.\nIt is an opera, with music and lyrics by Todd Almond, in its West Coast premiere at Kirk Douglas Theatre, where Almond’s musical titled “Girlfriend” played this summer. Fortunately, this one runs under an hour, not overstaying any welcome. Unfortunately, most notably, Almond’s co-star is Courtney Love.\nIt is a dreamscape, meant to evoke and not dictate audience thoughts and reactions. It starts as Kansas City Choir Boy (Almond), under large headphones, listens to a song he has written. He looks up to see a breaking-news report on his television: A woman has been found dead in New York City. He knows her. She’s Athena. They met when they were 16. So much is clear.\nAthena (Love) wanders back into his mind — or wherever you believe they’re meeting. He relives their first encounter, their early lust and then a point at which they sing, “Let’s call it our wedding day.”\nShe dons a crumpled hot-pink veil. They seem to undergo a ceremony. And apparently soon after this the love is gone. She’s disgusted, he’s enraged, she leaves. On a meandering odyssey, he tries to find her while evading sirens — six women in black punk attire (Paul Carey), who form a nicely voiced chorus and move through Sam Pinkleton’s well-suited choreography.\nAt some point we’re not in Kansas anymore. As in that dreamscape, nothing needs to make sense. In Almond’s score, a swirl of emotions replaces narrative, and this could provide a satisfying theatrical experience.\nBut Love either had an off night or doesn’t have the skills for this project. Her attempts at acting are stunningly self-conscious. She shows zero dance skills. And her singing voice is an unmelodious growl. She also comes laden with celebrity. So every time she is onstage, the audience is likely to lose any connection to Almond’s work.\nHe, to the contrary, is a captivating singer and instrumentalist. His score consists not so much of songs as of cris de coeur, which he delivers with a genuine and rather modest intensity.\nUnder Kevin Newbury’s direction, the piece gets strong visuals, though their proximity to the audience is distracting. The stage has been bared and is used for a portion of the seating, with cross-aisles where singers and a string quartet roam.\nSet designers Victoria Tzykun and Clark Parkan and lighting designer D.M. Wood worked to hoist the piece.\nAdvertisement\n“Make me your constellation,” Love growls, and dots of lights flare on the back wall. Pink fireworks erupt on that wall and on a pathway overhead, later sung about. That overhead pathway becomes a stretch of gray road, divided by yellow fluorescent bulbs.\nPresumably to represent Athena’s later celebrity, Love gets a gorgeously vast black ball gown, designed by Zac Posen (the décolletage of which seems to have expanded since early photos were taken of her in it).\nThe gown is onstage for a brief time, but its provenance and wearer cause the mind to unnecessarily wander away — as with far too much of this show.\nStill, the fans and the intrigued will undoubtedly buy tickets and come to gawk. Perhaps as with Athena, and Love, persons interested in music might have to ignore the fame to get to the heart of the opera.\nDany Margolies is a Los Angeles–based freelance writer.\nWant to go?\nOur rating: 2.5 stars.\nWhen: 8 p.m. Tuesday-Friday; 5 and 9 p.m. Saturday; 3 and 7 p.m. Sunday through Nov. 8.\nWhere: Kirk Douglas Theatre, 9820 Washington Blvd., Culver City.\nTickets: $25-$70.\nInformation: 213-628-2772, www.CenterTheatreGroup.org.", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151020/FEATURES/151029974/EP/1/1/EP-151029974.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:33:36.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
