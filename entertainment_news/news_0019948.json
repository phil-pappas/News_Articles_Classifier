(Barrett Stinson/The Independent via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT, TV OUT i Order Reprint of this Story GRAND ISLAND, Neb. \nA familiar face will be returning to the Central Nebraska Regional Airport this month after a year away. \nThat face has greeted the likes of race car drivers Mario Andretti, Bobby Unser and Dale Earnhardt Jr.; golfers Chi Chi Rodriguez, Arnold Palmer and Davis Love; tennis player Martina Navratilova; President Gerald Ford and U.S. Sen. John McCain; singers Frank Sinatra, Britney Spears, Kid Rock and Donny Osmond; military men Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., Colin Powell, Oliver North and Chuck Yeager; actors Dan Aykroyd and Paul Newman; comedian Bob Hope; media personality Martha Stewart; and baseball manager Tommy Lasorda. \nThe familiar face belongs to Rocket Bob, a more than 10-foot-tall, wooden statue that has been at the fixed-based operator terminal for nearly 30 years. The fixed-based operator fuels all planes and services private planes. \nThe elements had taken their toll on Rocket Bob, wearing away his color, cracking his face and wearing a hole the size of a softball in his massive cowboy hat. \n\"He was getting a little weathered,\" said Reggie Schmit, a pilot who has stored his plane at the airport for decades and remembers when Rocket Bob joined the airport in 1989 as the mascot for fixed-based operator Executive Air. \nExecutive Air owner Roger Ostwald had the statue chain-saw carved in California to become \"Jose,\" the face behind the motto, \"Fastest Hose in the West.\" Executive Air had underground tanks and could fuel four jets simultaneously in less than 15 minutes, Ostwald said. \n\"Rocket Bob is back from the days when jets had to stop all the time to fuel,\" said Vince Dugan, owner of Trego-Dugan Aviation, the current fixed-based operator. \nWhen the airport embarked on construction of a new general passenger terminal and new private passenger terminal for Trego-Dugan, the fixed-based operator had to decide if Rocket Bob would stay or go. \nStay, absolutely, Dugan said. \n\"This is a nod to the history of Grand Island as a mid-continent refueling stop and to Nebraska. This is the Wild West. We're on the frontier,\" he told The Grand Island Independent (http://bit.ly/1Qs0GXD ). \nThe next decision was how to spruce up the carving while keeping it the iconic image passengers and pilots love. \nEnter Grand Island artist Jean Cook. \nCook works as administrative assistant at Trego-Dugan. At work, she talked about her love of painting and hung some of her favorite pieces — flowers, landscapes and abstracts. She talked about workshops she attended and classes she's taught. \nCook, treasurer of the Grand Island Art Club, has had works in local and regional shows, had a piece touring with the Association of Nebraska Art Clubs show and had a solo show at the Carnegie Arts Center in Alliance. \nTrego-Dugan Vice President Zach Thompson and other employees had moved the statue to the maintenance hangar and started filling cracks and crevices. \n\"We were buying wood putty by the gallon,\" Thompson said. He approached Cook about giving Bob a new life. \nShe said yes immediately. \n\"He was a new challenge for me,\" Cook said. \nHe was slightly larger than a canvas on an easel. Cook measured up to Bob's elbow. \n\"He was a little bigger than I expected,\" she said. \nNext was the challenge of using oil-based exterior paint — the kind you use on a house — which responded differently than oil-based art paint. Working from six basic colors — blue, black, brown, yellow, red and white — she developed a flesh tone for his hands and face. \nShe used a bold red for his bandanna and hat, but it looked too much like plastic, she said. Cook experimented with shading to give Bob depth and dimension. \nCook used a mirror to study her own eyes to help shade Bob's eyes. She added wrinkles and creases in his shirt and designed a stylized concho for his brown chaps. \nUnderneath the chaps are blue jeans — but not just any blue jeans. They are Wranglers. \nShe added detail to his hair, his eyebrows, his sideburns. \nShe also painted the Learjet that Rocket Bob rides to replicate the Learjet N45EJ that Trego-Dugan manages. \nDugan called the finished work \"unbelievable.\" \n\"We're very fortunate to have Jean, but the work she did on that far exceeded what I could have hoped for,\" he said. \n\"You don't know how many people going from New York City to San Francisco are going to stop and take a picture with Rocket Bob,\" Dugan said. \"It's unique.\" \nHe believes passengers will ask pilots to stop at the terminal that has the Learjet-riding cowboy. \n\"I expect a surge of 10 to 15 percent in traffic once we get the new FBO (terminal) open with Rocket Bob,\" Dugan said. \n\"Rocket Bob had become worn, and his appearance wasn't what it was, but we still had people taking pictures with him,\" Dugan said. \"Now it's actually going to be an attraction, and it's going to welcome every company that comes to do business in Grand Island that flies in privately. \n\"First thing they're going to see is Rocket Bob. He's going to be famous.\" \n--- \nInformation from: The Grand Island Independent, http://www.theindependent.com \nAn AP Member Exchange shared by The Grand Island Independent Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:11:53.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
