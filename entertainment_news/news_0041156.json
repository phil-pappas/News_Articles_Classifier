A loose braided updo completed the look, and she opted for simple, girly make-up and a peachy lip. Gemma Atkinson (Ian West/PA) \nNatalie J Robb looked super cute in this lacy black number, with matching mini black patent handbag. However Natalie ought to throw those shoes into the sea and never retrieve them. Natalie J Robb (Ian West/PA) \nEx-Emmerdale actress Verity Rushworth looked elegant in this black ballerina-style gown and cute patent pumps. Major style points for the cute brown bob and touch of red lippy. Verity Rushworth (Ian West/PA) \nHas Nikki Sanderson been taking style tips from Jessica Rabbit? The former Coronation Street actress oozed sex appeal in this bodycon red number, complete with big bouncing curls and black strappy sandals. Nikki Sanderson (Ian West/PA) \nDaisy Wood-Davis glowed in a striking emerald green gown with a modest midi hemline, cream clutch and towering heels. Daisy Wood-Davis (Ian West/PA) \nSadly it looks like Charley Webb didn’t get the red carpet memo. Someone tell the girl she’s going to an awards ceremony, not a night out in Oceana. And burn those shoes. Charley Webb (Joel Ryan/AP) \nIt doesn’t matter how jaw-droppingly beautiful you are Jennifer Metcalfe, clothes like this should simply not exist. Jennifer Metcalfe (Ian West/PA) \nDid a dog maul your dress on the way out the door, Gemma Oaten? We can’t think of any other reason for the giant rip in the back of your gown… Gemma Oaten (Ian West/PA) \nEither Tamara Wall just got back from a very tropical holiday or she’s been soaking in a bed of fake tan for days on end. Let’s not even mention that weird Jedward quiff. Share article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:19:03.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
