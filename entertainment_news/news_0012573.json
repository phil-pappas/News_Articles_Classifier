AAron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post via Getty Images The Denver Broncos were almost engulfed by the Oakland Raiders and the Black Hole; but yet again, when it mattered most they were able to squeeze yet another big play out of the Orange Crush. Held without an offensive touchdown for the second time this season, a late pick-six by the Broncos' cornerback Chris Harris Jr . gave Denver a lead that they never surrendered; as they held on for a 16-10 victory over the hated Raiders in Oakland on Sunday.\nPeyton Manning saw his 1998 NFL Draft classmate Charles Woodson get the better of him; as the safety picked off the Broncos quarterback on two occasions. The NFL’s active leader in interceptions (64), these were the first two interceptions of Manning in Woodson’s 18 year career. Manning finished the contest 22/35 for 266 yards.\nThe Broncos running game again struggled, as C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman were held to 22 and 21 yards, respectively. The Broncos only netted 297 total yards on offense.\nThe video game numbers seen in previous seasons were not needed however, as the Denver defense again proved more than up to the task. In each of the Broncos’ five games thus far this season, they have made a big play late, coming away with the win.\nThe Broncos held the Raiders to 288 total net yards, , with only 65 yards coming on the ground. Denver sacked Oakland quarterback Derek Carr four times, intercepting him once and forcing him to fumble on another occasion. They also blocked a field goal attempt by kicker Sebastian Janikowski.\nDefensive captain DeMarcus Ware left the contest with a back injury and did not return. Fellow linebackers Von Miller, Shane Ray and Shaquil Barrett were able to pick up the slack however, each picking up a sack.", "external_links": ["http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Injury-Update-vs-OAK-Ware-out-with-back-injury/2fff434a-9631-4094-81df-1d7b3aaa5fa7", "http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015101110/2015/REG5/broncos@raiders#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000554757&tab=analyze"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:36:11.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
