The way I think seems to chime with the Scots thinking.\nPromoted stories “And I’m sure the Scots will come to think more about Corbyn (as the answer). He’s had a lot of bad press from the right wing, but he seems to be calm and look to achieve a consensus.”\nBailey’s comedy has always been clever, involving smart juxtapositions - he once teamed up Kant's Critique of Pure Reason with the theme-tune from Match of the Day.\n“I love doing that. And I love talking about what I feel is wrong. And as long as there is pomposity and stupidity and arrogance out there, then there’s plenty for a comedian to get worked up about.”\nBailey’s but he ever think this comedy-music hybrid to be risky?\n“I did. There was a time when comedy and music were seen as poor relations, a mongrel version of what comedy is supposed to be. You would hear the complaints; ‘Oh, it’s not just you with a microphone and a suit. You’ve got a mandolin as well you folk-singing hippy.’ But it’s not a cop out. It’s hard work.”\nBailey was a clever clogs at school, in Bath. His real name is Mark; Bill was a nickname given by a teacher.\n“I think I got into comedy because I couldn’t really do anything else. I don’t deal well with constraints. I’d do well at school, but then react against it, and get into shouting matches. I felt I was being owned by some teachers and the only subject I enjoyed was music.”\nThe questioning stance has worked. Bailey is now regarded as one of the most original comedy acts on the circuit. He even gets to hold up the end of the Graham Norton sofa, alongside stars such as Matt Damon. How hard is it to be the Comedy turn?\n“It is an odd one. Of all those chat shows it’s the most fun to do because you’re on the sofa the whole time, not just wheeled on and off. But it’s surreal to sit there with the Hollywood A-listers who have no clue who you are, and think ‘Who’s this weird bloke on the end?’ But they’re all very nice. And you get time to tell a story.”\nDid he go drinking afterwards with Damon? “No, he was being flown off to Spain to do another two hours press, but I liked hearing what he was saying about his Oscar success. He was a good sort.”\nBill Bailey seems a good sort too, who doesn’t seem driven to pursue fame and comedy success.\n“Comedy is great, it’s the chance to make sense of the world, to be scathing, to be articulate. It’s one of the last bastions of free speech.”\nExcept on television? “Yes, that’s right. That’s where I have the debates with the lawyers, and it drives me crazy. But live, I can say what I want.”\nHe adds: “Especially in Scotland. The audiences are honest, and if they like you – or don’t – they let you know, unlike the more metropolitan crowds.”\nHe breaks into a laugh: “Except in Aberdeen. One show I did had gone really well in Edinburgh and Glasgow but then this Aberdeen audience sat with their arms folded. And two hours into the gig I was thinking ‘What the hell? Have I lost it? Is this what happens? Do I go back to the telesales job?’\nShare article “They applauded the end, thankfully. And I think what was happening was they didn’t want to show appreciation too soon. They didn’t want success to go to my head.”\n• Bill Bailey’s Limboland is at the Music Hall, Aberdeen, October 19 and 20, and SECC Glasgow, October 21 and 22.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-06T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:52:22.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
