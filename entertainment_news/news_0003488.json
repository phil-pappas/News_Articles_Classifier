Though Pankaj Kapur is in his usual over-the-top mode and Shahid Kapoor tries to match his father’s air, the tingling interaction might just be an entertaining boost to the film. \nHere’s a look at the five most memorable father-son face-offs in Hindi movies (though we are afraid that there are no counterparts in the father-daughter, mother-daughter or mother-son combinations that are worthy of space in our memory closets): \nAmitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan / “Sarkar” \nAs a father-and-son duo who thought nothing of breaking conventional law, Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan excelled as two men with strong convictions who loved each other and the family deeply, and were completely unscrupulous with those who crossed their paths. Father was the remorseless chieftain, and son the intense, completely ruthless man whose anger was seething with bottled-up fury. Despite the fact that the film could have been much better, their chemistry was electrifying — and made the Ram Gopal Varma product worth it. \nAmitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan / “Paa” \nIn a role-reversal, Amitabh Bachchan played a 12 year-old kid suffering from the aging disease progeria, while Abhishek Bachchan was his affectionate doctor-father, watching helplessly as his darling child who looks like an old man withers away. While the senior Bachchan was obviously exceptional, the younger one was in his most underrated performance ever. Onscreen, they were a combination that delivered much more intensity than we thought possible even in this meaty script. \nDharmendra and Sunny Deol-Bobby Deol / “Yamla Pagla Deewana” \nDharmendra played a lovable rogue, and so did his sons Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol, and the lost-and-found element in this action comedy only added to the charm of the three rakish con-men who came together and slid headfirst into a deluge of oddball situations. The three Deols showed a rare camaraderie that was more like friends, a complete contrast to their real lives, in which the dutiful sons rarely cross the line of respect for a father, and that is precisely what charmed the audience. \nPrithviraj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor / “Janwar” \nPrithviraj Kapoor was the martinet dad and Shammi Kapoor the rebel son who wants to marry a poor girl. The scenes between them were not many, but the intensity was notable, especially from Shammi Kapoor’s raw emotions and Prithviraj’s classic interpretation of the arrogance of a rich man. \nSunil Dutt and Sanjay Dutt / “Munna Bhai MBBS” \nAs the indulgent father who gets disgusted with his errant son and noble-hearted loafer, father and son Dutt respectively played memorable turns that had a sharp comic edge, as well as an emotional climax. Neither was known to be a great actor, but the brilliant script and direction helped them etch an immortal father-and-son combo onscreen that moved the audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:47:29.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
