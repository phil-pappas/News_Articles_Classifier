FreeCast's Rabbit TV Plus boasts a solution welcomed by consumers and TV executives alike, as it creates a common sandbox that the networks will ultimately need to be successful in serving over-the-top consumers.\nAs Netflix reports disappointing numbers , one of many explanations was that content producers, namely the TV networks, have become increasingly suspicious of the streaming services to whom they once outsourced their VOD offerings. Realizing they've created a potential competitor, many have begun to rethink their strategies and create in-house VOD products to offer to consumers, rather than bolster Netflix and Hulu as streaming rises to challenge traditional TV. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings made the point that a dream come true for cord-cutters was sometimes seen as a nightmare by the TV industry that fears missing out on profits.\nAs streaming services like Netflix and Hulu cease to be repositories for TV content of all stripes, consumers could be in for a rude awakening when they're forced to visit, if not subscribe to, multiple services to get the content that was once all in one place. FreeCast's Rabbit TV Plus solves that problem, allowing consumers to find all of the content they want to watch in one place, even as they access them from a variety of sources. This means that content creators can make their own content accessible to consumers and monetize it, without boosting a potential threat to their own business.\nFreeCast CEO William Mobley explained the growing need for technology to aid consumers' navigation of a fast-growing web TV universe: \"Just look at your average cable subscription. It delivers loads of content, often hundreds of channels as well as VOD and more. And central to that experience is the on-screen guide, which is the only way consumers can handle all that they're getting. Take that away, and you've essentially got the internet. Everything's there, but nobody knows how to get to it. That's why so far, they've stuck to a few channels, like Netflix and Hulu. Rabbit TV Plus is a guide that allows consumers to navigate the vast and wild world of web video with the same ease as the traditional TV subscriptions that they're familiar with.\"\nMore Information:\nCompany: http://freecast.com\nNetwork: http://rabbittvgo.com\nProduct: http://rabbittvplus.com\nThis press release was issued through 24-7PressRelease.com.
