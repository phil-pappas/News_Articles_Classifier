Created by Byron Balasco and airing exclusively on Audience, Kingdom is a family drama set against the gritty world of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) in Venice, California, and revolves around Alvey Kulina (Frank Grillo) who owns and runs Navy St. Gym with his girlfriend, Lisa (Kiele Sanchez). Season two finds Alvey's fortunes have led to a bigger gym but also a bigger appetite for risk. Ryan \"The Destroyer\" Wheeler (Matt Lauria) defends his title, while Alvey's son Jay (Jonathan Tucker) finds a new obsession. Lisa (Kiele Sanchez) focuses on managing Alicia (Natalie Martinez), an impulsive but skilled female fighter. Meanwhile, Alvey's other son Nate (Nick Jonas) is determined to get back in the cage, which is causing a rift with the family. And Christina (Joanna Going) gets a taste of sober life while carrying the burden of her sons' struggles -- with victory comes agony and a price. \nDebut Art Exhibition Featuring Edgar Harutyunyan \nThe Hollywood Production Center is grateful to have such amazing tenants.
