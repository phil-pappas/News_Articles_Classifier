Retired workers receiving Social Security benefits has more than tripled since 1970, from 13.3 million in 1970 to over 39 million in 2014.\nWhat the previous generation depended on to meet retirement income needs is no longer viable. Corporate pensions’ as we knew it are just about non-existent. And Social Security benefits are underfunded and even if you receive these benefits in retirement they are less than adequate for meeting even the most basic living expenses.\nSpencer and Noble talk about the great need for this briefing because retirement is an epidemic affecting an overwhelming number of people. As a result retirees are entering uncharted territory facing significant challenges and obstacles to enjoying the reward for a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice.\nThe most profound retirement challenges facing retirees and soon-to-be-retirees is the subject of their new special briefing being held in Alpharetta at the Marriott Hotel. It is designed to educate and inform about the retirement tax traps that many will easily fall into and the major mistakes many retirees have made that can cost them their comfortable retirement lifestyle.\nThe fast-paced 77-minute presentation examines the impact on retirement of 7 major retirement fears and concerns including: living too long; running out of money; increasing tax burden; growing cost of living; expanding deficit; rising health care costs; and not passing on family values along with money.\nThis is profoundly important for retirees as many find themselves 75 years old, in great health, full of life and potentially running out of money. AARP reported that 2 out of 3 older Americans fear running out of money more than death, yet there are more millionaires than any previous generation.\nSpencer and Noble’s extensive research and work among soon-to-be-retirees and retirees across the country worth a million and up to nearly a billion collars, share the fear of running out of money. Regardless of net worth most retirees are not getting answers that put their fears and concerns to rest.\nA recent CBSMarketWatch article, Our Next Big Crisis Will Be The Retirement Crisis, estimates that 1 out of 2 retirees are at risk of not being able to maintain their standard of living in retirement.\nSpencer and Noble’s latest briefing on retirement addresses this concern with the purpose of dispelling fact from fiction about the hype around retirement fears and concerns.\nThe briefing also addresses tax traps on IRA and retirement money and how to access it for maximum lifetime and legacy benefit.\nThis new retirement briefing is designed to be both informative and entertaining, using stories of famous and not-so-famous people to illustrate the possible retirement and estate planning mistakes that have cost retirees thousands of dollars.\nIt further outlines practical next steps people can take to protect their retirement wealth, including: three methods to increase a retirement “paycheck” and create an income that can’t be outlived; accessing tax deductions used by the ultra-wealthy that are available to most people now; simple steps to reduce taxes on IRA and other retirement money; how to legally bypass capital gains taxes on stocks, bonds and real estate assets; and the one thing everyone must do before taking social security benefits.\nThe latest information about their final retirement briefing of 2015 designed for couples and individuals with retirement accounts, business owners, executives, professionals, and millionaire retirees can be found at http://www.retireabundant.com .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13022136.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13022136.htm"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:38:21.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
