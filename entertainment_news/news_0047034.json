The 29-year-old performer (she's got more strings to her bow than \"singing\") and the 34-year-old actor got engaged on Valentine's day earlier this year, whereupon Gaga got presented with a massive heart shaped rock .\nTo promote the show, Gaga posted the below pic to Instagram over the weekend, captioned: \"Some people just like to drink blood for fun. #ahspremiere #ahsfans #ahshotel.\" In case you're wondering, she plays the landlady of the hotel, The Countess, who's partial to a bit of red.\nAnd then she posted this vid of her puppy - who REALLY wants a bit of her burger - because you need to keep the followers happy.
