It's been blown completely out of proportion. Daniel worked 128 days on this movie and he works incredibly hard.\"\nReportedly filming Spectre was quite tough as Craig had injured his leg while filming action scenes in the Austrian Alps.\nNaomie Harris added: \"He injured himself on the movie and came straight back after the operation and worked despite being in pain. He continued to do his stunts, despite his pain. I've seen him work 15-hour days and then come back and train for two hours. He does all of his own stunts unless the insurance won't allow it.\"\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Hollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH:SPECTRE - Final Trailer (Official)\nNinja Assassin Amazon.in : INR 719.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xO-c%2BqTZL._SL160_.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4UDNzXD3qA", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://www.amazon.in/Ninja-Assassin-Rain/dp/B00ISP0FTU%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00ISP0FTU"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:14:11.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
