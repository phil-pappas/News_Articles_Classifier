The only family members to do so were half-sisters Kendall, who tweeted a plea (\"Please don't go\") and Kylie Jenner, who abandoned a live stream Tuesday evening to be with her family.\nplease don't go.\n— Kendall Jenner (@KendallJenner) October 14, 2015 Had to end my live stream. I love you guys.\n— Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) October 14, 2015 Kim's former husband, fellow NBA player Kris Humphries, asked his followers for prayers on behalf of his former brother-in-law:\nEveryone please pray for @RealLamarOdom to make it through this. Great player, even better person!\n— Kris Humphries (@KrisHumphries) October 14, 2015 TMZ.com reports the family flew to Vegas aboard a private jet within two hours of hearing the news. The site published a photo of a distraught Kris Jenner pacing outside the hospital.\nAfter a month of dating, Odom's 2009 wedding to Khloé was filmed for the family reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians . He was occasionally seen on that show and the spin-off Khloé & Lamar until their 2013 separation, prompted by his relapse into substance abuse. At that point, she petitioned to legally change her surname back to Kardashian.\nOn Sunday, E! re-aired a Keeping Up With the Kardashians episode in which Kim warned her sister about keeping in touch with Odom. In an interview with producers, Khloé made it clear that she didn't talk to him because she wished to rekindle their relationship; rather, she remained concerned about his well-being: “I love Lamar and care about him a lot; it makes me feel good to hear his voice and to know he is doing OK.”\nLater in the epsiode, Odom called her after a lifelong friend died. She expressed concern about what it might mean for his mental state and sobriety, noting, \"I'm really on high alert for Lamar because anything will set him to spiral and that's the last thing I want for him.\"\nTMZ edited the relevant clips together and posted the video on its website.\nHTTP://WWW.TMZ.COM\nLamar Odom Went Off the Rails Sunday Over 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians'\nIn a telephone interview with Good Day New York , brothel owner Dennis Hof said that Odom had not been drinking excessively but confirmed he did appear upset after receiving a phone call Sunday regarding the Keeping Up With the Kardashians episode.\nLamar Odom and then-wife Khloe Kardashian arrive at the Philippe Restaurant West Hollywood grand opening in Oct. 2009.
