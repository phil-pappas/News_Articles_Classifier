(Photo: Yu Tsai)\n3 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Five albums in, pop stars are finally hitting their strides.\nTaylor Swift earned some of the best reviews of her career for the ubiquitous, synth-driven 1989 , which continues to set records nearly a year after its release. Selena Gomez, meanwhile, showed restraint and maturity on her just-released Revival , whose slinky first single, Good For You , is her highest-charting to date. Fellow ex-Disney star Demi Lovato continues the No. 5 winning streak with her latest Confident (**1/2 out of four), a loud and adventurous stride into new musical terrain, albeit one that lacks the precision of her peers' efforts.\nUSA TODAY\nSelena Gomez stages musical, personal 'Revival'\nThe album gets off to a, well, confident start with blaring horns and pummeling drums on the raucous, rousing title track, which finds Lovato declaring her dominance: \"I used to hold my freak back / now I'm letting go / I make my own choice / Yeah, I run this show.\" Unlike most of her Top 40 contemporaries, Lovato has long-infused her brand of pop with rock 'n' roll grit, heard here and on the electric-guitar riffs of first single Cool For The Summer . While its limp attempts at being provocative emit little heat ( Katy Perry endorsed same-sex flings more cleverly on 2008's I Kissed A Girl ), Summer is still one of the catchier songs on the album, whose other potential radio hits are harder to identify.\nKingdom Come , almost inevitably, will be serviced as a single at some point, if not solely for its guest star Iggy Azalea (Lovato's close friend). The gloomy EDM track is reminiscent of Azalea's own smash Black Widow last summer, although the Aussie rapper's seemingly rush-job verse here isn't quite as fun (nor too encouraging for her forthcoming \"comeback,\" with rhymes like, \"Gather around, now I'm back from my holiday / 'Long live the Queen,' what the people say' \"). Lovato aims for the dance floor on the similarly hypnotic but forgettable Old Ways , and further switches things up on thunderous anthem For You , channeling Lady Gaga in what may as well have been a Born This Way B-side.\nUSA TODAY\nDemi Lovato teases bicuriosity: 'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with experimentation'\nWhether a stripped-down ballad ( Stone Cold ) or R&B-flavored smackdown ( Waiting For Ya ), Lovato's powerful pipes are always dialed up to the glass-shattering max. While she inarguably has one of the strongest instruments in pop right now (her soulful take on Hozier's Take Me to Church last month was especially stirring), the 23-year-old also suffers from an affliction best described as \"Jennifer Hudson Syndrome.\" Like Hudson, Lovato can't resist the urge to add one more riff or belt to every song on Confident just because she can. Particularly on album closer Father , written about her estranged late dad, the song's heartbreaking lyrics could have packed a bigger punch had she scaled back on the vocal somersaults.\nIt may seem trifling to fault an artist for singing too well, but a little subtlety can go a long way. Still, Confident is overall an assured step forward for Lovato, who should only hone her sound and style by the time album No. 6 rolls around.\nDownload: Confident , For You , Father\n3 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LxoERm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f26924b222bd0aebc3b8e89ab95bf2472fba5c3/c=0-270-2461-2731/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779909673898544-gty-486058024-75505558.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeWBS0JBNzQ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af6efaecea01117ef8f36d47c83aebbf583b1b48/c=0-22-1173-1586&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803432152364795-Hollywood-Records-D-L-03-0405-Bnz.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAp9BKosZXs", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4edc83e488b64aa5ca4f6e8329a23d489e87a606/r=267x400/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803432152364795-Hollywood-Records-D-L-03-0405-Bnz.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LxoERm&mini=true", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3u22OYqFGo", "http://usat.ly/1LxoERm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3fbfccd4032d54cb0c323ca0905bb6bf7393849e/c=867-1066-2772-2971/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793084878872229-05-SG-Interscope-01204-v02.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LxoERm&text=Album%20of%20the%20week%3A%20Demi%20Lovato&via=usatoday", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwLRQn61oUY?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803432152364795-Hollywood-Records-D-L-03-0405-Bnz.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:01:11.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
