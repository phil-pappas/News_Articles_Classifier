This is due to the poor weather conditions on Saturday keeping the track silent for most of the day. The day and time for qualifying for the race has also been moved from Saturday, when it was washed out due to heavy rain, to Sunday morning before the race in the afternoon.\nAccording to COTA , ticket exchanges are \"subject to availability\" and \"may not be the exact same seat location.\" The intent, however, is to honor a Saturday ticket with a \"comparable\" ticket on Sunday. Exchanges can be arranged at one of the COTA ticket offices at the Main Grandstand or in Grand Plaza.\nQualifying has moved to 9 a.m. on Sunday; gates at the track will open at 8 a.m. The race remains scheduled for 2 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.\nDue to soggy ground conditions in the grassy parking areas, COTA has also modified its parking for Sunday. Fans who have purchased parking permits for Lots G, L, or N need to know that these lots will be closed on Sunday. They should go downtown instead and catch the shuttle offered from the Austin Convention Center at 4th and Trinity. Free tickets for up to four people are available for the shuttle ride offered to these fans.\nWhile grassy Lot T will remain open, guests are advised to use the downtown shuttle, due to muddy conditions. Lot E patrons are now asked to park in Lot F; however, Lot F permit holders are now asked to use the downtown shuttle at no additional charge.\nThe 973 Park N Ride guests should now use the paved lots at Southeast Metropolitan Park (located on the north side of SH 71 at Ross) or Del Valle High School (located on east side of Ross south of SH 71).\nThose with pre-paid permits for Lots A, B, C, D, and H should know these paved lots will remain open and available for their use on Sunday.\nWhile rain kept action away from the track for most of Saturday, fans were allowed an unusual visit to the pitlane at the end of the day where many were able to meet the drivers in their garages. Formula 1, individual drivers, and COTA all thanked the fans through social media for their patience and loyalty during the dreadful weather conditions on Saturday.\nAccording to Weather.com , the weather for Austin at race time on Sunday, October 25 will be a cloudy 63 degrees F with a 15% chance of precipitation and 86% humidity.", "external_links": ["http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/USTX0057:1:US"], "published": "2015-10-25T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:38:22.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
