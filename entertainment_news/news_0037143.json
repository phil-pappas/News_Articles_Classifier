Federal Minister of Environment Andrae Rupprechter on Tuesday said with present measures Austria would meet the set targets, Xinhua reported. \nEEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx had earlier in Brussels presented an annual forecast report, in which Austria along with Belgium, Ireland, and Luxembourg were named as four countries in the union not on schedule to meet greenhouse emissions targets. Rupprechter argued that the reason for the poor EEA prognosis is that Austria’s present environmental protection measures are only set in stone until 2018, in line with the legislature period.
