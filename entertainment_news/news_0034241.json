Ever since Mukkathe Penne became a hit, some listeners started congratulating the former duo, and at one point, Gopi Sunder himself clarified in a comment in his facebook page that it was he who composed the song. Gopi Sunder was supposed to compose the music for the entire film, but was not able to, owing to prior commitments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:41:22.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
