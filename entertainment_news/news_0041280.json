He is still in the ICU, is receiving oxygen and sleeps a lot. He is not talking, but seems to understand when Khloé [Kardashian] and the medical staff speak to him. He will have another head MRI in the next few days to check for any damage that could have been caused by the strokes.\" \nHowever, while Lamar is making progress, \"he's not out of the woods yet\". \nThe source said: \"He still has a lot of problems with his internal organs. His kidneys are a big worry. He has done a lot of damage to his body. \n\"He will probably never be back to where he was before. Damage has been done.\" \nLamar's estranged wife Khloe, 31, has been with him since he was admitted to hospital and has barely left his side. \nThe insider explained: \"Khloé still hasn't left his side and looks very tired. As soon as Lamar wakes up, she rushes over to hold his hand. She sleeps on a pullout bed next to Lamar.\" \nA 911 call made from the brothel confirmed Lamar took cocaine last Saturday (10.10.15) and owner Dennis Hof revealed he was taking herbal Viagra and drinking cognac. \nThe combination of herbal Viagra and cocaine can be deadly. \nA source told E! News: \"Drugs were found in his system. [He] had been partying since Friday. He was doing crack cocaine all weekend. They're now having to fix all the damage it has done. \n\"Virtually every drug imaginable was found in his system.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:44:36.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
