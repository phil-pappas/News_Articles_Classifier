The film's director Nadirshah also doubles up as its composer and lyricist and what he brings to the fore is his talent in the humor department.\nThe opening track Premamennal sung by the lead stars of the film and Kalabhavan Shajon can be termed a Malayalam tapori number, which has the potential to enliven the proceedings on screen, going by its funny lyrics. All the singers had proven that they can shoulder a song with ease in the past and thus, no surprises there too. The next song Manjaadum sung by Vijay Yesudas, Afsal and Samad has a catchy intro and hooking beats. A fun-romantic number, it doesn't hold your attention as a standalone song and is situational at best.\nThe album slows down with the third song Yenno Njanende by the popular little singer Sreya Jayadeep. It flows smoothly and Sreya sings it with accuracy, though the lyrics are routine and as expected for such a track.\nThe final track Pranayam, sung by Nadirshah, is more like a cassette-version of a new age poem with some interesting lyrics. Though it might not appeal to you enough for repeat listens, the song has done well in all departments and would hold your attention at least for a while.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:39:07.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
