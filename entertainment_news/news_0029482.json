Who will become the final \"America's Next Top Model?\" The CW It’s time for another episode of “ America’s Next Top Model .” It’s been two weeks since the last episode, and this week is an episode recapping the weeks prior with some unseen footage.\nWe start with the first episode as the models all took their initial photos on the top of a double decker bus that was driving around Los Angeles. From there, Tyra, Miss J and Kelly narrowed the field down to 22 contestants.\nOur first behind-the-scenes footage shows deaf contestant Nyle teaching the models some sign language. He shows them how to say America’s Next Top Model, but then he says that what they were actually saying was Nyle is “America’s Next Top Model.” What a jokester!\nThe models then go to the model home where they are greeted by the Property Brothers, Jonathan and Drew Scott, who designed the house. From there it’s time to claim a bed. Then, we get another glimpse at some unseen footage of Devin being annoying, and claiming that he is signed with six agencies. This prompts Bello to say that Devin needs to learn some humility.\nPoor Alexa is in over her head, not wanting to share a bathroom and sleep on the floor. The next day at the first photo shoot, she decides to leave the competition. One model down. We are down to 21 models, but by the end of the episode there will only be 14, of whom will move into the model home and compete to be “America’s Next Top Model.”\nBut Tyra didn’t just call out the names of the 14 finalists. They were asked to walk on a catwalk three stories high while being attached to wires that would either take them from the end of the runway to the shipping containers on the other side, or drop them slowly to the ground, to be eliminated.\nThe next episode showed the models getting a “teach” from Tyra on how to show your neck. She used animals as examples of good neck and bad neck and had them demonstrate. Devin didn’t do so well, looking more like a chicken then an owl.\nThe models did a photo shoot tied up in pairs, and Delaney became the first casualty as she struggled to model below the waist.\nAnother behind-the-scenes look was at the contestants performing with Tyra on the opening sequence where they all sat at a table in a yellow room. Nyle was especially excited to actually work “with” Tyra on the set.\nThis is where we see our first couple form with Mamé and Justin. Another pair of models that got close as friends was Nyle and Dustin. Nyle says that Dustin is the first person in the house that tried to learn sign language so he can talk to him.\nTime for another behind-the-scenes sequence. We see that Tyra had some fun with the models’ Ty-Overs by creating a game show called “Turnt Up Ty-Over” where they would have 4 choices. They can keep the envelope they start with, or go for the Ty-Over behind curtain 1, 2 or 3. Think “Let’s Make a Deal.”\nDevin is the first contestant to play, and he decides to keep the envelope rather than try one of the different make-overs behind the curtains. Good thing he did. The 3 curtains had loads of curls, model mullet, or the rainbow-colored Afro that is “drekitude.” (That’s a André Leon Talley reference.)\nThe next day the models go to the Cristophe Salon for their Ty-Overs, and in new footage, we see that Lacey was having a hard time with her new look. She said she knew that it was going to make her look more high fashion, but she’d never done anything to her hair before, so it was hard for her.\nThat week, Stefano was sent home in judging.\nEvery week, the models have access to the confessional, where they talk about the happenings of the day. In extra footage, we see Devin talking in the confessional about how he’s such a fun-loving guy, and he loves everyone, but others, including Lacey go in the confessional to tell how they feel. Lacey says she knows that Devin talks about her behind her back, and Bello makes fun of Devin, saying “I ain’t going home no way” in the same way that Devin has said it.\nNext, we see what happens when Devin and Mikey start trash talking Ava’s winning photo, saying it needs to come down. Courtney witnesses this and goes to Ava to tell her what is going on behind her back.\nThe next photo shoot was the un-retouched shoot, and Dustin had a hard time acting serious, and Yu Tsai was really unhappy with him. Dustin ended up going home.\nDustin isn’t the only one trying to learn Nyle’s language. We see Lacey is also trying to learn sign language from him, and she demonstrates some words she’s learned, like her own name, fake, cute, teach and congratulations.\nThe next photo shoot is the possessed photo shoot. This theme scared Lacey, who is a devout Christian, and Bello also had problems with the shoot, as he ended up just being scarey.\nDrama is always around in the house, and the two pageant girls, Mamé and Hadassah were constantly at each other’s throats. This prompted Justin to call a house meeting to address things and try to get them to stop sniping at each other all the time.\nThe next model to be eliminated was Ava.\nDuring the acting challenge, Devin’s lack of seriousness made him get bad remarks. The problem was that Ashley was teamed up with him on the challenge, so his badness reflected on her as well, putting them both in the bottom in the challenge scores.\nSeveral of the models had problems perfecting their slow motion run on the beach in the video shoot on the beach. The two that had the most problems with it were Courtney and Bello.\nBetween the acting challenge and the beach shoot, Ashley and Devin ended up in the bottom two, with Ashley going home.\nThe STEM challenge was next. The models were in teams and had to make a Vine video about STEM. The winning team was Mikey, Mamé and Hadassah, and the win allowed them a shopping spree, where Hadassah and Mamé actually became friendlier with each other.\nIn the confessional Mamé and Justin complain about how the other models are slobs, and they feel like the mother and father of the house.\nIn the living doll photo shoot, Hadassah is pumped to participate as she has over 300 dolls in her collection. Mikey did really well in the shoot, while Bello just looked crazy.\nIn judging that week, we find out that Courtney doesn’t know anything about fashion. She admits in the confessional that she doesn’t read magazines, she just looks at the pictures. She couldn’t even name a single designer when asked to by Tyra. What? That is crazy for someone that wants to be in the fashion industry not to know a single designers name.\nThe go-see challenge was next. This is the episode where the eliminated models returned to pair with a model that is currently in the competition. It happens every Cycle. But this Cycle has a twist. In this Cycle all the eliminated models came back and had the chance to re-join the competition, AND they would take the place of one of the current models.\nGo-sees were where the pairs of models had to go and see as many of the designers as possible (there were a total of 4) in a 3 hour time period.\nThe teams were Justin and Dustin, Devin and Bello, Mamé and Courtney, Mikey and Ashley, Nyle and Delaney, Hadassah and Ava, and Lacey and Stefano. Everyone made it back in time except for Mamé and Courtney, who went to all 4 designers, but were eliminated from the challenge for being late. The winner was Hadassah, who booked 3 of 4 designers. Mamé had booked all four, but couldn’t win because she was late.\nIn the dog photo shoot, Devin got a really good shot, as did Nyle, whose blue eyes rivaled the blue eyes of his dog. Justin did not have a good shot, and along with his disappointing challenge score, he was sent home, while Devin came back to the competition.\nThe final episode prior to this one had the models heading to Las Vegas where they checked into their penthouse suite at the SLS hotel.\nThe challenge was to shoot a music video for Tyra’s new makeup line. Each person had a part and some did really well. Surprisingly, Nyle, who is deaf did really well. He listened to the music in headphones that allowed him to get the beats of the song with the vibrations, so he was on point for all his lines which he signed. Dustin wasn’t so lucky. He didn’t bother to learn the lines and he couldn’t get his timing right, and his return was short-lived and he was sent home.\nSix models remain in the competition. Mikey, Mamé, Devin, Lacey, Nyle and Hadassah. Who will go home next?\nNext week, “America’s Next Top Model” will air on Friday night at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT.
