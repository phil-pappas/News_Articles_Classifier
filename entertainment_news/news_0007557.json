The network announced a pilot order for the untitled Adam Levine show which has the band's frontman on board as executive producer. The concept of the show is to surprise fans with the stars who will show up at their milestone events. \"A couple about to get married suddenly discovers that a world famous recording artist is leading the house band,\" a logline from the show read. \"An Emmy Award-winning actor becomes an unexpected guest of a bachelorette party. Working with a team of improv experts who create the element of surprise, these stars give their fans a moment together they will never forget and turn their already special event into something extraordinary.\" It is yet clear whether Levine will play a part in front of the camera. David Dobkin who directed the music video will helm the pilot and serve as executive producer as well. The announcement came a week after NBC terminated the plan to invest on Levine's music-themed limited series \"The 1970s\". The video of \"Sugar\", which has garnered more than 700 million views since its January premiere, follows the band as they crashed weddings and played to the bride and groom's surprise. There was debate on whether it was staged and Levine confirmed some of them were fake. \"I do want to clear up something about the video,\" Levine told The National. \"Half of the weddings we crashed and the other half were set up, we did that to cover our bases and to make sure we had all the footage. I would say 65 per cent of the video was real. It was crazy and a lot of fun.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:13:42.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
