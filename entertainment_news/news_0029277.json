The bigger the flag. The louder the flyovers. The weepier the salutes, the better. The NFL is certainly in the thick of this. As America’s most-popular professional sport, the league goes out of its way to promote their patriotism.But what you may not know is that the NFL has been charging the Department of Defense for these military tributes. That’s right, they aren’t seen as a way to honor the military, but rather, it’s an advertisement tool for branches such as the National Guard where the lion’s share goes.Over the last four years, the NFL has charged $6 million has gone to 16 clubs over 45 contracts to honor those in the military.Now, members of Congress, including former Vietnam War POW, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) are going to vote on a proposal to ban taxpayer-financed salutes to troops. U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-2nd Dist.), calling it \"paid-for patriotism,\" plans to bring up a similar measure during House debate on its version of the defense bill, which take place all day through Friday.At a time when the NFL seems to have reached a new low in credibility, something new comes along to knock it down further. It would be bad enough that the league would be charging for the salutes. The men and women that serve the country get exploited far too much to begin with. But the idea that you and I as taxpayers are ultimately the ones putting money for these charged salutes and calling it advertisement may have redefined the word “greed”.\"It's crass,\" McCain said in an interview. \"I want them to give the money back.\"“Crass” may be an understatement.The NFL saw gross revenues of $12 billion last year. Using a bad pun, maybe it’s not just revenues for the league that are “gross”.Below shows where taxpayer dollars have gone for military salutes in the NFL via NJ.com Military contracts with NFL team sFrom 2011 to 2014, the Department of Defense paid at least $6 million to NFL teams for salutes to the military and other advertising, with most coming from the National Guard, according to federal contracts.\nTeam Contract # Amount Date Department Division ATLANTA FALCONS FOOTBALL CLUB, LLC W912JM11C0001 $70,000 2/2/2011 Department of Defense Army/ARNG ATLANTA FALCONS FOOTBALL CLUB, LLC W912JM11C0021 $250,000 7/29/2011 Department of Defense Army/ARNG ATLANTA FALCONS FOOTBALL CLUB, LLC W912JM13C0013 $315,000 7/12/2013 Department of Defense Army/ARNG ATLANTA FALCONS FOOTBALL CLUB, LLC W912JM14P0131 $114,500 8/5/2014 Department of Defense Army/ARNG ATLANTA FALCONS FOOTBALL CLUB, LLC W912JM12P0091 $300,000 7/20/2012 Department of Defense Army/ARNG BALTIMORE RAVENS LP W912K611P0170 $85,000 1/4/2012 Department of Defense Army/ARNG BALTIMORE RAVENS LP W912K613P0114 $195,000 7/30/2013 Department of Defense Army/ARNG BALTIMORE RAVENS LP W912K613P0114 $89,500 9/18/2013 Department of Defense Army/ARNG BALTIMORE RAVENS LP W912K612P0123 $250,000 8/3/2012 Department of Defense Army/ARNG BALTIMORE RAVENS LP W912K611P0170 $265,000 9/9/2011 Department of Defense Army/ARNG BUFFALO BILLS, INC.
