October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Approximately 124 out of 100,000 women in Michigan were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, according to the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “With everybody involved, all of our survivors really have their spirits lifted to have the community come and support them in this way,” said Renee Rivard-Burmeister, community manager for the Lakeshore Division of Making Strides Against Breast Cancer. “It is a celebration of survivorship.” Last year, the event raised about $42,000. This year, the fundraising goal is $50,000. So far, about $22,000 has been pledged on the event’s website. Funds raised by the event go to the American Cancer Society to further breast cancer research — as well as to local services, like a wig bank for those in treatment and to fund transportation for breast cancer patients to their treatment. Registration at the Strides Against Breast Cancer event begins at 9 a.m. at Kollen Park. The walk is open to the community and there’s no registration fee — though donations are encouraged. From 9-10 a.m. at Kollen Park there will be yoga and a groove dance, as well as some new additions to the event: live music by the band Garage, a photo booth and children’s activities. The walk begins at 10 a.m. at Kollen Park, and travels on sidewalks on a route that travels through downtown Holland and then back to Kollen Park by way of 12th Street and Washington Avenue. The 5K (3.1-mile) walk will include a shorter, 1K (half-mile) option as well for the first time this year. Water will be available at the first and second miles. Participants can bring strollers and wagons, but bicycles and pets are not allowed. The event’s main sponsors are Holland Hospital and Spectrum Health Cancer Center. — Follow this reporter on Twitter @SentinelAmy.
