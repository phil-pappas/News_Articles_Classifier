But don’t chalk this strange phenomenon up to evolution – the animal appeared to have a front paw injury. \nThis handicap was key in identifying the black bear when, this month, when he waltzed through a yard in Oak Ridge, New Jersey. Unfortunately, this time, the creature was missing his right paw and witness Sabrina Pugsley told ABC News that his left one “just dangles uselessly.” \nThe bear, nicknamed Pedals, is currently on the radar of New York State’s Orphaned Wildlife Center and is being considered for rehabilitation. The nonprofit’s board member, Kerry Clair, observed from the recent footage that he is “severely underweight going into winter” and is likely wandering through people’s yards because he is extremely hungry. \nAlthough terrifying, Pedals is beloved by his Jersey neighbors. The creature currently has a GoFundMe page that’s well surpassed the $15,000 goal. Launched by Pugsley, the profits will go towards his recovery at the Orphaned Wildlife Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:46:20.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
