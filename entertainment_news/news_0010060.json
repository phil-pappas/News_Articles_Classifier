In the spirit of the season, masked performers will be a part of this year’s final Fourth Friday Art Walk on Oct. 23 from 5:30 to 8 p.m. The art walk season will be capped Friday, Dec. 4, with a final event. \nOne and all are invited to wear masks or simply enjoy the masked promenade as they go from gallery to gallery — more than 15 downtown venues participate, marked by blue flags. There will be paintings, photography, sculpture, ceramics, etchings, assemblage and fine craft of local Maine artists. Featured performers include mask theater specialist Beverly Mann, With Breath Puppetry and poet Michael Darigan. Mann’s sculptural masks will be on view at High Street Gallery. \nFor more information about art walks in Belfast, call 323-8692 or visit belfastcreativecoalition.org . \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
