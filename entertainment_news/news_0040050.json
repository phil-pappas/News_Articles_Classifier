(Zwallpix) \n'I'm 43, I don't need to look like a virgin when I get married!' she told People last month. 'I want to look sexy. Personally I don't like the natural look that some brides do.' \nIn the past few years, Sofia has worn Zuhair Murad designs to the Emmy Awards, the premieres of her movies Chef and Machete Kills, and most recently to the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year. \nMeanwhile, the Modern Family star will be trying out some bridal make-up options over the next few weeks. \nSofia in Zuhair Murad at 2012 The Emmy Awards. (The Fashion Court) \nShe will certainly be hoping to avoid repeating the wardrobe malfunction she had in one of the pieces at the Emmys in 2012, when her gown split open at the derriere. \nSofia’s make-up artist Kayleen McAdams – who is also the little sister of actress Rachel McAdams – revealed to E! that she will be behind the star’s beauty look for her wedding. \nSofia also wore Zuhair Murad for her guest appearance on 'Late Night with Seth Meyers' and the 'Chef' premiere at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. (Red Carpet Fashion Awards) \nHinting at what the actress might be going for, she said: ‘You see her on the red carpet, she has a very classic look you know. I wouldn't be surprised if it were something like that.’ \nSofia told People last month that she wants ‘a bold lip’ and revealed she will be wearing her auburn locks down. \n'I think women, once they hit 40, they shouldn't put their hair up again until they're 60,' the Colombian bombshell explained. \nThe actors will tie the knot at The Breakers in Palm Beach following a cocktail reception there the previous evening, according to Us Weekly. \nA source told the magazine that they have sent out their luxurious white 7x7 invitations, and that it ‘cost around $7 to mail each one’. \nWhile Sofia and Joe are sparing no expense on the wedding, which is being planned by Mindy Weiss, they have apparently asked for donations to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in lieu of gifts. \nFiancé Joe Mangianello is known for his portrayal of werewolf Alcide Herveaux on the HBO television series True Blood and stripper Bick D*ck Ritchie in Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL. (Twitter) \nSofia told Jimmy Kimmel last month that she has had to negotiate the guests with Joe. \n'We're very excited. We'll kind of keep it a little private, but it's been kind of impossible because people have been very excited in my family. It's like 400,' the Hot Pursuit star said. \n'It was very hard [to cut down]. We said, 200 for you, 200 for me, but my 200 is like family, so I couldn't invite many of my friends.' \nShe added, 'The truth is that he gave me some of his [invites] because I was in trouble. There were people from work that I needed to bring.’ \nSofia’s Modern Family cast-mates were all invited to the wedding, and her on-screen husband Ed O’Neill is said to be particularly thrilled about it. ‘Ed is already ready,’ she said. ‘He's very excited.’ \nSofia and Joe got engaged on Christmas Day last year after six months of dating. This is the second marriage for the actress, who wed high school sweetheart Joe Gonzalez at the age of 18. \nThe pair share son Manolo, 23, and divorced a year after his birth. Sofia was previously engaged to Nick Loeb from 2012 to 2014. \nBy Iona Kirby", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:53:16.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
