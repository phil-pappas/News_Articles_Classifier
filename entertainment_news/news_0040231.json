He was reluctant at first, but Schultz joined what would later be called Pictometry. The company takes aerial pictures across the country for digital maps. The former professor was CEO and Schultz was the chief technology officer.\nThe business spurted along until the CEO found an outside investment group which offered $2 million. Schultz and the CEO needed the money, so they took it. Soon thereafter, the investors took over five of the seven seats of the company's board of directors and decided how and when the company could issue stocks. In essence, they took major control and they did it quickly.\nUltimately, Schultz said he made money when the company was later sold but most of the original employees didn't get much of anything.\n\"A bunch of us who started this company and grew it to large amounts are now watching from the outside,\" he said.\nSchultz said he made two biggest mistakes while with Pictometry. First, he said he didn't pay attention to the corporate structure and stock part of the company. He said he ignored it and focused on the technology side.\n\"I worked 100 hours a week,\" Schultz said. \"I was single and had I not been, I would have been after working those hours.\"\nThe second mistake, he said, was not getting patents for some of his early work, particularly the work that lead to oracle spatial technology.\n\"So when you go on Google Maps and search for stuff and it finds it by address, we invented that years ago,\" Schultz said. \"It sure would have been nice to patent that base technology.\"\nSchultz told his story as a precautionary tale to a crowd of entrepreneurs and startup leaders in Rochester. He spoke Tuesday night during The Failure Sessions, a series of informal confession talks organized by a group of entrepreneurs with Digital Rochester. The premise of these sessions is for the entrepreneurs to reflect on how a previous startup failed and for future startup organizers to learn from someone's else mistakes.\n“This event is to celebrate failure”\nEd Bizari, Entrepreneurial Special Interest Group, Digital Rochester \"Hopefully young people or young entrepreneurs can benefit from that in the future,\" said Ed Bizari, who led the entrepreneurial group for Digital Rochester.\nThere had been two previous Failure Sessions before Tuesday night. The first one looked at failures from a startup CEO perspective and the second one was a mashup of people in different positions. Tuesday's event focused on failures from the chief technology officer's point of view.\nBizari said he came up with Failure Sessions after realizing that Rochester's startup scene is full of private conversations where young entrepreneurs glean advice from successful business owners and startups. Bizari said he wanted to flip that concept. A few days later, Bizari said he saw a New York Times article about a similar failure-focused event in Silicon Valley. It was then he knew the event would work in western New York.\nTuesday was the last Failure Session for 2015. Next year, there will be three more. The first one, in March, will feature all women entrepreneurs. Specifics on the June and September sessions are still being determined.\nSchultz's advice centered on the power of a board of directors while Aaron Newman, the second speaker Tuesday, cautioned the audience on adding unnecessary people to the leadership team.\nNewman said he successfully started and sold his first startup in part because he and a buddy he trusted were the founders who split the profits.\nAt his second startup, Application Security, Newman said he and his friend added a third co-founder who later blocked money from a group of Boston investors. The third guy, whom Newman said wasn't ethical, blocked the deal and asked for $1 million in order to give his OK for the Boston money. This forced Application Security into bankruptcy.\n\"And we had 15 people working for us at the time and customers,\" Newman said.\nThe company came out of bankruptcy, grew, and the new board of directors abruptly fired the CEO.\n\"I guess he didn't wear suits the right way or cow tip to them enough in board meetings,\" Newman said.\nNewman said the board eventually hired the CEO back to sell the company. Newman said he still equates the whole saga he went through as a failure.\nBoth Newman and Schultz said the core of their problems long ago was not knowing enough about the business side of a startup. If he had a chance to do it again, Schultz said he would have gotten a seat on the board at Pictometry and learned about how companies issue stock.\n\"I never felt, as the tech guy, as one of the 'in' guys on the board,\" he said. \"Pay attention to that. The board controls a lot, especially when it comes to compensation.\"\nKJBROOKS@GANNETT.COM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:03:47.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
