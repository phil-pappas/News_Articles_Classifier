I’ve never experienced anything like this.”\nNadine likes it that the series bridges generations. “We’re really happy kasi marami po’ng nanonood like ’yung mga lolos and lolas. Sabi nila parang napi-feel ulit nila na bumabata sila. Tapos ’yung mga fans po natutulog daw po silang may ngiti sa labi nila,” she said.\nNote that the twosome counts their own parents as avid viewers of the show themselves.\nNadine shared, “’Yung mom ko kinikilig din po siya. ’Yung dad ko naman po, super proud po siya tapos nanonood po siya every night. Tine-text niya po ako, ‘Galing mo na um-acting ha. Mana ka talaga sa’kin’.”\nJames, on the other hand, said his father commended him for his work on “OTWOL.”\n“Actually, ginagawa ko ’to (pag-a-artista) para sa pamilya ko, so to know that my father is happy and proud of my work, that’s all I really need,” he said.\nDespite their popularity, the two still have their share of critics.\nNadine finds it sad that bashers would badmouth even her parents. She has a good mind to ignore them though, relating, “Kung papatulan mo eh sasabihin pa sa ’yo ‘Pumapatol ka,’ so ’wag na lang pansinin.”\nGETTING INTIMATE\nJames and Nadine’s onscreen chemistry is undeniable, as fans would attest. They are thrilled with how the two interact and deem even their kissing scenes realistic. The duo’s appreciate the fans’ ardor but maintain their onscreen sizzle is just that – for show.\n“Actually, before po (mag-shoot ng kissing scenes) tawanan lang kami, after po (mag-shoot) more tawanan pa po,” Nadine said. “Ganu’n naman po all the time kasi po tingin ko po medyo nasanay na rin po kami sa mga kissing scenes.”\nThe most memorable kissing scene they did for the show is from the episode where Leah finally got her Green Card.\n“Nagulat po kami kasi nu’ng ginawa po namin ’yun, tatlong kiss lang ’yun, tapos nu’ng pinalabas na ang dami. Eh katabi ko ’yung mom ko na nanonood,” Nadine said.\nWhen asked if there would be more lip action between their characters, the 22-year-old James said, with a naughty glint in his eyes, “Oh, yes.”\nAs much as they are now more comfortable with each other, the two would rather not take their relationship to romantic levels.\n“What we have is good, we don’t want to spoil it,” James said.\nNadine agrees, believing romance might hinder their success. “Like, what if magkaroon po kami ng away, s’yempre mahirap po magtrabaho ’pag meron pong ganu’n,” she reasoned.\nBut James is not closing his doors. “Who knows? As long as we’re working together ayoko ng complication, but yeah, who knows,” he said.\nHowever, he thinks Nadine might feel differently. “Because I know focused siya sa trabaho, so good luck to that.”\nOne thing’s for sure, James makes the 21-year-old singer-actress happy.\nNadine shared, “Kasi ako naman po very emotional ako even in real life, so most of the time tahimik lang ako tapos siya (James) po lagi ’yung nagpapatawa sa ’kin. Gusto ko po kasi ’yung laging nagpapatawa sa ’kin.”\nAs to rumors about James being a ladies’ man, she said, “There’s nothing to be worried about.”\nEXTENDED KILIG\nOTWOListas, as fans of the show call themselves, have good reason to rejoice with producer Dreamscape Entertainment announcing its decision to extend the series until February next year, in time for Valentine’s.\nMeanwhile, as an early Christmas gift, fans could also purchase a DVD of the first six weeks of “OTWOL” starting November.\nMore, they could also watch the couple on the big screen in the 2015 Metro Manila Film Festival entry “Beauty And The Bestie” with Vice Ganda and Coco Martin.\n“Super excited for that kasi first time po naming mag-MMFF,” Nadine said.\n“On The Wings Of Love” airs weekdays, 9:15 p.m. on ABS-CBN’s Primetime Bida.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:11:24.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
