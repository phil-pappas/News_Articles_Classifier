It drew an average audience of 7.83m with a 33.2 per cent share of the total TV audience. (Ray Burmiston/BBC) \nOver on ITV, an average of 7.49m (including those watching on ITV +1) were glued to X Factor’s Six Chair Challenge, which achieved a share of 32.4 per cent. \nThe figure for fans who viewed just on ITV was 7.12m. \nDuring the show, Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora were given the categories they’ll be mentoring this series (Overs, Groups, Boys and Girls, respectively) and judge Rita selected her final six for the Judges’ Houses stage of the competition. (Syco/Thames TV) \nBack in August, X Factor supremo Simon had laughed off any talk of a ratings rivalry with Strictly, joking about the lack of a star-studded line-up. \nHe had claimed his show could easily beat Strictly: “I’d hate to say yes, because I know what will happen if I say yes, it will come back and haunt me. \n“This show does feel better, the talent’s great, they’re interesting, so if it’s us versus Peter Andre, I’m going to put my money on us.” (PA) \nDespite losing to Strictly once again in the ratings, Simon can take heart from the general upward trend of X Factor’s ratings. (PA) \nOn August 30, the ITV singing show’s first Sunday broadcast aired to an average of only 5.94m viewers (not including fans watching via timeshift on ITV +1). \nThe BBC will be very encouraged by the consistent performance of their celebrity dancing series. (PA) \nAlthough it has dropped slightly from the 8.69m who tuned in for the glitzy launch, Strictly has so far maintained an audience above 7.6m viewers. \nIn an attempt to avoid the two series clashing, ITV published episode times for X Factor right up until the final in December.
