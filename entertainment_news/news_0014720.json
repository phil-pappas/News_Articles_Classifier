X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nSir Elton John and One Direction will headline the Royal Variety Performance 2015, to be attended by Prince Harry. \nSir Elton, one of the biggest solo artists in the world, is currently in Las Vegas playing a series of dates in The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. \nChart-topping band One Direction had their status as one of the globe's most lucrative groups confirmed when it was revealed they had earned Â£6 million a month earnings in 2014. \nBand members Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson are set to split for at least a year in 2016, but fifth studio album Made In The A.M. is due for a global release on November 13. \nThe star-studded night at London's Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Jack Whitehall, the youngest ever presenter of the Royal Variety Performance. \nThe 27-year-old comedian will introduce performers from around the world, including pop sensations Kylie Minogue, Ricky Martin, The Corrs, Josh Groban and American country singer Kacey Musgraves. \nSpeaking about the big night, due to be filmed on Friday November 13, Whitehall said: \"Having been lucky enough to perform for Prince Charles and Prince William in previous years I look forward to the opportunity of sailing a little too close to the wind in the presence of Prince Harry this time round. It's my third time on the show and I still am yet to perform in front of The Queen, she must be really desperate not to see my act.\" \nThe event is staged in aid of the Royal Variety Charity (formerly the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund), whose patron is Her Majesty The Queen. \nIt will be screened on ITV in December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:28:29.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
