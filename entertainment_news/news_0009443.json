Henson‘s “Empire” character to call him for help. “EMPIRES TV RATINGS TOOK A HUGE HIT. Ok I’ll stop now. COOKIE CALL ME BABY. I’ll tell every body to watch the show for you. LOL,” he wrote. As TheWrap previously reported, “Empire” attracted a massive 16 million viewers during its premiere last week. But the ratings dipped on Wednesday night to 13.7 million viewers. While those are still huge numbers, 50 Cent has a long-running spat with “Empire” and jumped at the chance to gloat. The rapper, who in the past has accused the Fox series of copying the promotional campaign of his Starz drama “Power,” mocked “Empire” on Instagram after it took a dig at him in its Season 2 premiere. During the episode, Cookie Lyon dropped a wisecrack calling 50 Cent “thirsty” — translation, he’s desperate for attention. The “Get Rich or Die Tryin’” rapper fired back in a video post saying, “I can’t believe Cookie would say some shit like that about me. Thirsty? Me? Thirsty? Come on.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:34:47.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
