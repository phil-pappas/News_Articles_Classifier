I know it's typical for New Yorkers to see vermin everywhere, but this is the first time I've ever seen a rodent on the premises, and I'm pretty sure it's grounds for breaking my lease. Even if it's not, I dare you to sue me! I'm buying a cat and a blowtorch tomorrow with no idea which I'll use first.\nMore from American Horror Story 20 articles Is the Goal of \"American Horror Story: Hotel\" to... Here Is the First \"American Horror Story: Hotel\"... New \"American Horror Story: Hotel\" Teaser... \"American Horror Story: Freak Show\" Finale Leaves... Angela Bassett needs to show up and zap that mouse the way she zapped Donovan last night. What an entrance! Ramona Royale blazed her way onto the scene by shoving Donovan in the trunk of her car, taking him home, and cleaning his blood. P.S, the no. 1 way to let your neighbors know you're a vampire is to have a giant blood centrifuge in your foyer, just sayin'.\nTemporarily pushing aside the fact that Ryan Murphy can only put people of color in his shows if he's representing them in the most stereotypical way possible, Ramona Royale is an old-timey badass vampire. She used to be a blaxploitation star of films like Slaughter Sister and Silky Fine , pulling knives out of her Afro and blowing away pervs with a shotgun, but then she met The Goddess. Once The Goddess sliced open her boob and turned Ramona into one of the permanently undead in a fit of sapphic glory, it was all fierce-clothing-montage-party in the hotel elevator for two decades until Ramona broke her heart by falling in love with '90s rapper Prophet. Listen, I'm not opposed to a good old-fashioned sex scene, but Angela Bassett, one of our nation's finest actresses, deserves better than licking rust-colored corn syrup off Lady Gaga's tits.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail FX The Goddess wasn't having any of this Prophet stuff, so she slaughtered his crew and then blew his head off. The Goddess vs. The Prophet! There's definitely some religious tension to be explored there but you can bet your ass I'm not the one to do it.\nRamona has been seeking revenge ever since, and once she sets her sights on the creepy vampire children who live in the walls, she thinks Donovan is the key to revenge-filled success. Too bad he's been sucking the blood of junkies to get by since he got kicked out of the hotel! What I love about this scene is that she tells him her whole entire plan , then just unlocks him and lets him go. Ramona is a Scooby Doo villain, and her superpower is pulling a switchblade from thin air at any moment. I'd mostly like to know how she got that mansion, and where it says in the contract that once you become a vampire, you are automatically Monopoly-man wealthy.\nThe Goddess was also super rich at one point, but she hilariously lost all her money to Bernie Madoff. At least that's the reason she stops Tristan from trying to murder Will Drake — she wants to marry Will and take all his money, while Tristan only wants to murder him to impress his new ghostly bestie, James March. Tristan has the worst pickup lines this side of the Rockies, including but not limited to \"You're a Scorpio, which explains a lot,\" \"Everyone in jail smells like shit but a man has needs,\" and, \"I Googled you,\" but The Goddess literally tried to bone Will Drake while wearing a gold-plated pan flute as a necklace, so shit is rough all over. Let's all never date ever again, OK? Did you hear Will's son say \"owned\" after Tristan said something snotty to Will? Let's also stop having kids immediately.\nWill was cruising around with Claudia (Naomi Campbell), who died disturbingly in the room the Euro models used to live in. Gabriel the half-dead junkie leapt out of the mattress he was sewn into, strangled her, and then stabbed her to death. Look, I've never been brutally assaulted and then jammed into a mattress by a woman who chews her own teeth, but if I ever regained consciousness only to find someone sitting on me I would just let them squash me to death. Just go ahead and squeeze the life right out of me. Gabriel ran into John Lowe's arms, told him he accidentally killed a woman because he thought she was Sally, and then died in the hospital on a gurney. Maybe. He was twitching and sputtering before he flatlined, but in the world of AHS , that's just like taking a nap.\nSpeaking of ol' Sally Chews 'Er Teeth, did you ever notice that her near permanent tears signal some of the worst horror on the horizon? Once you see the little crystalized slug trails appear under her peepers, you know something terrible is about to happen. This time she cried in the elevator, gave John Lowe half a handy, and then magically disappeared, right before she let a few tears go and tried to murder Iris. To be fair, Iris asked her for it — Donovan blew her off brutally so she has no reason to live, and a forced heroin overdose is kind of the gentlest way you can die in a murder palace. But it doesn't take! So Sally gently places a bag over her head and lets her asphyxiate. Did she tie the bag with a bolo tie? That seems doubly cruel. Now Sally and Iris are the sole members in the Take Turns Killing Each Other Club, ta da! Donovan has a change of heart about how he's treated his mom and valiantly turns her into a vampire at the last moment, even though she used to feed him so much fiber he shit his pants at school. There's a terrible idea! You have to live forever, and now you're stuck with your mom! At least she gives good side-eye.\nAlex Lowe (Chloë Sevigny) also wants to get in on the horrible parent action, and wastes no time by admitting she never wanted kids but loved her son way more than she did her husband and daughter. She tried to kill herself a year after he died, and now spends her time shaming parents for refusing to take their measles-stricken children to the hospital. She's obsessed with the way Holden's head smells like lavender but listen — don't all baby heads smell like whatever soap you wash them with? I'm not a parent so I'm just applying logic here.\nI like that Alex is basically the feminist id of the show. When she shows up at the hotel with divorce papers, John tries to plead his case by saying it must be weird to have him out of the house and she's like, \"No, it's not rough at all and I don't want you to come back.\" God bless you, Alex — you're a tough bitch but I like your style.\nJohn is busy having a mini breakdown, since he showers in murder, brushes his teeth with murder, and comes home to sleep under a murder blanket. He's still doing his day job, which includes investigating another Ten Commandments murder. This time, a bunch of journalists at a gossip site had their tongues nailed to their desks. h, Ryan Murphy, what on earth are you trying to say?\nAfter John insists that he's seeing things, Alex gives him drugs, and he crushes his own high by asking her to have another baby. She bounces right the hell out of there, but she's stuck in the murder hallway. Right after Naomi Campbell's bloody ghost caps on her \"knockoff\" outfit, Alex sees Holden.\nThis week was a little funnier than it was disgusting, and I was happy for the small reprieve. I still have some questions though. Is Alex going to move into Hotel Cortez now? Will she take Scarlett with her or bring a baby vampire back to live with her in the normal world? Is the Ghost Maid the only maid in that joint? And how much time has passed that still allowed Gabriel to stay alive in that mattress?\n​Follow Danielle on Twitter .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/knottyyarn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1445522066-ahs-503-0057d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x917/gallery-1445522066-ahs-503-0057d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/37/320x160/landscape-1441905689-screen-shot-2015-09-10-at-12155-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x1101/gallery-1445522066-ahs-503-0057d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/768x384/gallery-1445522716-ahs.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/gallery-1445522716-ahs.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x688/gallery-1445522066-ahs-503-0057d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/29/320x160/landscape-1436811994-screen-shot-2015-07-13-at-22554-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x1405/gallery-1445522066-ahs-503-0057d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/480x240/gallery-1445522716-ahs.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/980x490/gallery-1445522716-ahs.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445522716-ahs.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/gallery-1445522716-ahs.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444916482-ahs-502-0250d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/04/320x160/landscape_nrm_1421940987-o-american-horror-story-freak-show-finale-facebook.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/640x320/landscape-1445522066-ahs-503-0057d-hires1.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1280x640/gallery-1445522716-ahs.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:23:27.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
