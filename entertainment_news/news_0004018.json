The alleged sex assaults ended when Hill became a college sophomore, the suit claims, at which time Cosby was reportedly paying for her rent and tuition. \nThe suit doesn't pertain to the alleged sexual assault, but rather claims Cosby, his wife, Camille Cosby, and his attorney, Martin Singer, defamed Hill, made statements that cast her in a false light, and intentionally inflicted emotional distress by claiming those who accused Cosby of sexual assault were liars. Hill wasn't mentioned by name in those denials, but they were made after Hill first made her claims against Cosby in November of last year. \nHill's attorney, George Kontos, will hold a press conference in Pittsburgh later Thursday to discuss the suit. \nMore than 50 women have made sexual assault accusations against Cosby. His lawyers have denied sex assault accusations against the comedian in the past, and Cosby has never been criminally charged in connection with any of the allegations. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
