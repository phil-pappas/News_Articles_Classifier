They expect thousands to explore the weird \"must-visit\" free site at www.paranormalmingle.com .™\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278477\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278589\nNot only do they expect Halloween traffic to be heavy, but feel it may very well become a permanent important rival to the big dating destinations. Say the site is edgy, interesting and unique enough to become major long-lasting attraction.\nSo what makes it so different?\nTo begin with, its \"spokesman\" is called The Gatekeeper™ (No place else in the dating industry do you find anything as unusual and daring as that). He is presented as a multi-purpose apparition that not only welcomes singles through his gates, but also distributes information and opinions via press releases.\nHis latest handout describes his domain as a place where men and women who question the unknown, ghosts, UFOs, life after death, vampires, and zombies, plus government conspiracy theories, can peruse, talk and date - The ultimate goal being to find their soul mates.\nAccording to The Gatekeeper™, \"Once you enter my world, you are transported to a destination where your opinions are shared, valued and broadened.\"\nHowever, before visitors do that, they are first are confronted with a landing page featuring what sounds like funeral music and the voice of The Gatekeeper™ himself welcoming and beckoning visitors to become a free member by clicking on www.paranormalmingle.com ™.\nActually, the site may sound dark and foreboding, but according to The Gatekeeper™, \"Yes, we are frightening. We are scary. But there is nothing about my domain that is contrary to any religion.\" He invites visitors to discover this for themselves. Even if it is just to satisfy their curiosity.\nhttp://paranormalmingle.wix.com/supernaturalsoulmate?_ga=1.129579596.1517888894.1436170841\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ParanormalMingleCom-631955326947789/timeline/\nPinterest\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/paranormaldate/\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/Paranormaldates\nLinkedIn\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/paranormalmingle\nGoogle\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/115788999043425379196/posts\nPaper Li\nhttps://paper.li/e-1427965664\nTumblr\nhttp://paranormalminglecom.tumblr.com/\nMedia Contact:\nRoger Dextor\n6319243888\nEmail\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/halloween-trick-or-treat-how-about-meet-paranormalminglecom-offers-spooky-opportunity-300162691.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
