Well, two, actually – best live act, and best world stage for his performance at V Festival in 2014. Funny how @Edsheeran won Best Live while hosting the #MTVEMA …live. https://t.co/udfOxvfOUD \n— MTV EMA (@mtvema) October 25, 2015 Thank you for the two EMA awards yep \n— Ed Sheeran (@edsheeran) October 25, 2015 \nHe threw a banana, for some reason.
