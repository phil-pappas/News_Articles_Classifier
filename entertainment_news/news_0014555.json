Car Chasers season airs 8:10 p.m. every Monday. \nDan Short is an automotive force of nature. He does whatever it takes to restore cars to the highest possible standard, and he doesn’t care who he has to steamroll, charm or sandblast along the way. \nShort knows that each car is a powder keg of hidden surprises and problems to be solved, and the only way that a restoration will succeed is if the owner is as committed to the restoration as Short and his team. \nWitness top class automobile restorations in the all-new episodes of Fantomworks, premiering 8:10 tonight. \nFew men can make it in the high stakes game of airplane repossession, and Airplane Repo follows them on their clandestine missions. Banks and creditors call these guys to outfox deadbeat owners and recover the expensive aircraft – they are the best of the best in what they do. The latest episodes of Airplane Repo premieres 8;10 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 28. COMMENT DISCLAIMER: Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by MST.ph.
