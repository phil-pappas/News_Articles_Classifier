Pic/AFP \nOra reveals she was groomed by a 26-year-old man when she was studying as a drama student at the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, reports femalefirst.co.uk.\n\"I was 14 when I had my first relationship with a guy. I would say he was about 26.\n\"I don't want to say that I suffered it, because I wanted it. I don't want to say that I was forced to do it. I don't want people to think I was abused as a kid but I was definitely more mature than I should have been at 14,\" Ora said.\nThe \"Body on me\" hitmaker has admitted the attention she received from the man made her feel \"sexy\" at the time.\n\"I can't begin to tell you how confident I felt when a man was interested in me. I felt like I was sexy, I felt like I had a form of respect, I felt like he listened to me.\n\"Now I know he listened to me because he obviously wanted to have sex with me. I felt good that men fancied me,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:22:19.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
