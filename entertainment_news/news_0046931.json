That video of stuff being thrown around a kitchen from Cork, although that turned out to be completely fake.\nNow, we've got a dashcam image of a supposed ghost that was caught on camera by a long-distrance truck driver. George Furst was driving through Cork and entering the Jack Lynch tunnel when his colleague, Stephen Smyth, just HAPPENED to take a picture as they entered the tunnel.\nFurst, who's from Liverpool originally, had a reason for asking his colleague to take a picture of the tunnel. \"I wanted to wind them up and say I was back home in Liverpool as the entrances to the two tunnels look similar. But once I saw the strange figure in the picture I realised I'd caught something a bit more special.\"\nThe driver speculated that it might have been someone who drowned in the River Lee as the tunnel is not that old. According to the image, Furst and Smyth believe it looked like some Downton Abbey, 19th century man in a tweed jacket. What do you see?\nCan you see the ghost of a drowned man in this Cork tunnel? http://t.co/cb5cbOq4EL pic.twitter.com/6OJpYdaicv\nâ€” Irish Sun (@IrishSunOnline) October 2, 2015\nThrough advanced computer graphics imaging, we've been able to enhance the image 5,000% beyond the human eye and reveal what the ghost of the Jack Lynch tunnel looks like.\nTake a look...\nHorrifying.
