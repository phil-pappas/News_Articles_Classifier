Diane Keaton, Annette Bening, all of these fabulous fearless women who are flawless, they embrace it! You know, to each their own; I don't judge it if you do it, but sometimes I wish I could beg the people I know, who I am very near and dear to, to not touch their face.\"\n— Harper's BAZAAR Australia , August 2014\n© The Associated Press Iggy Azalea\n2) Iggy Azalea\n\"I love them so much I had to talk about them...I'd feel better not to have some secret. It's much freer to say it and then you don't have to worry someone will dig it up.'\"\n—On her boob job to E! , March 2015\n© Lionel Cironneau/AP Naomi Campbell 3) Naomi Campbell\n\"[It's fine] for those who do it for themselves and not to please someone else.\"\n— Harper's BAZAAR , March 2012\n© Instagram 16 Celebrities on Plastic Surgery 4) Kylie Jenner\n\"I'm not against plastic surgery. \"I've only been under [anesthesia] once before, when I went to the dentist and I didn't react well; it really scared me,\" she wrote. \"I threw up and I was SO nauseous the next day. But as of now, I only have lip fillers...But I'm also someone who says 'never say never.' If, down the line, I get to a point where I'm really uncomfortable with something on my body, I'm not against changing it.\"\n—Kylie Jenner Official App (via MTV )\n\"You guys have watched me grow up since I was 9. My face is going to get different. Now, I know how to do my makeup, contour, and everything. I'm not against surgery. I'd never say no, but I don't desire it right now.\"\n— Cosmopolitan , January 2015\n© AP Kim Kardashian 5) Kim Kardashian\n\"Trust me honey, if I take this bra off you will tell me I need to get them done. I'm totally not against plastic surgery...I've tried Botox before. That's the only thing that I've done.\"\n\"But what's funny is about my nose, it's my biggest insecurity. I always want to get my nose done...I went to a doctor, I had them take the pictures, he showed me what it would look like and it just didn't...I wouldn't look the same.\"\n— Nightline , May 2010\n© AP Kourtney Kardashian 6) Kourtney Kardashian\n\"I have had breast implants, but it's so funny 'cause it's not a secret, I could care less.\"\n— Nightline , May 2010\n© The Associated Press Nicole Kidman 7) Nicole Kidman\n\"I did try Botox, unfortunately, but I got out of it and now I can finally move my face again.\"\n—La Repubblica, reported by The Huffington Post , January 2013\n© Steve Granitz via Getty Images Lady Gaga 8) Lady Gaga\n\"I have never had plastic surgery, and there are many pop singers who have. I think that promoting insecurity in the form of plastic surgery is infinitely more harmful than an artistic expression related to body modification.\"\n— Harper's BAZAAR , August 2011\n© The Associated Press Karl Lagerfeld 9) Karl Lagerfeld\n\"Nothing makes you look older than attempting to look young. You can fool anyone, apart from the young. The worst are the lip operations. There are people who have it done and I don't recognize them afterwards. They look like they flew through the windscreen during a car accident and were patched up badly afterwards.\"\n—Zeit.de, translated by The Telegraph , May 2014\n© The Associated Press Julianne Moore 10) Julianne Moore\n\"I'd like to think that I can age as naturally as possible. I don't want to come out condemning anything anybody does, because I think that all of these things can contribute to making people feel better about themselves, and that's great. But I also want to look like myself. I mean, we're not going to live forever. You could be dead at 45, and guess what? Then you don't have to worry about aging.\"\n— The Edit , December 2013\n© The Associated Press Gwyneth Paltrow\n11) Gwyneth Paltrow\n\"I use organic products, but I get lasers. It's what makes life interesting, finding the balance between cigarettes and tofu. I've probably tried everything. I would be scared to go under the knife, but you know, talk to me when I'm 50. I'll try anything. Except I won't do Botox again, because I looked crazy. I looked like Joan Rivers!\"\n— Harper's BAZAAR , May 2013\n© Getty Images Julia Roberts 12) Julia Roberts\n\"Your face tells a story... and it shouldn't be a story about your drive to the doctor's office.\"\n— Elle , August 2010\n© Barry Brecheisen/Invision/AP Gwen Stefani 13) Gwen Stefani\n\"I'm hoping my children will save me from my vanity.\"\n— People , October 2004\n© AP Emma Thompson 14) Emma Thompson\n\"I'm not fiddling about with myself. We're in this awful youth-driven thing now where everybody needs to look 30 at 60.\"\n— Telegraph , August 2011\n© The Associated Press Sofia Vergara 15) Sofia Vergara\n\"Why not? I mean, not yet, but maybe [I'll do] my under-eye bags in my 50s. We'll see what I need, but I'm not saying no!\"\n— Redbook , August 2014\n© The Associated Press Kate Winslet 16) Kate Winslet\n\"I will never give in. It goes against my morals, the way that my parents brought me up and what I consider to be natural beauty.\"\n— The Telegraph , August 2011\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/kardashians-nightline-interview/story?id=10689693", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/news/beauty-insider/2014/8/jennifer-aniston-plastic-surgery-botox-interview/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/beauty/news/a18549/sofia-vergara-beauty-tips/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8700007/Kate-Winslet-Cosmetic-surgery-goes-against-my-morals.html", "http://www.net-a-porter.com/magazine/226/9", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a34921/kylie-jenner-cosmo-february/", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/g2647/gwyneth-paltrow-interview-0513/?slide=1", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/", "http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a11346/julia-roberts-462418/", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/g1847/naomi-campbell-interview-0312/?slide=1", "http://www.mtv.com/news/2277826/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/31/nicole-kidman-botox-plastic-surgery_n_2590149.html", "http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20145742,00.html", "http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10824094/Karl-Lagerfelds-lessons-on-ageing.html", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a713/lady-gaga-interview/", "http://www.eonline.com/news/640782/iggy-azalea-is-happy-she-admitted-to-getting-a-boob-job-i-love-them-so-much-i-had-to-talk-about-them"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:11:54.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
