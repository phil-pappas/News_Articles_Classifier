I, over time, read so many books, watched so many movies, did so much art, met so many sculptors, filmmakers, poets, musicians, sidewalk artists that I invented something that was much stronger than I ever could have been on my own. And that is what, for me, is what (sic) I see between my fans and what I hope to achieve together... \n\"This is just the best thing that has ever happened to me. And a toast to a new age of romantics, and let's lift each other up and take care of kids as they struggle with depression and anxiety, while they ask themselves every day why do I feel so sick, and the answer is because you're meant to make things. So let's help them make things.\" \nOther honorees included veteran actress Sophia Loren, who was presented with the Carolyn Clark Powers Lifetime Achievement Award by director Rob Marshall, and Paul Simon, who was on hand to pay tribute to jazz legend Herbie Hancock with the Outstanding Contributions to the Arts Award. \nPrior to attending the gala, Gaga was celebrating a big night for her actor fiance Taylor Kinney, who was also in town for the premiere of his new movie, \"Rock the Kasbah.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:00:09.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
