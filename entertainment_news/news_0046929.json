Airline Spokeswoman Andrea Huguely told the AP that Flight 550 was diverted shortly after 7 a.m. Monday and the first officer safely landed the plane. She also confirmed that the flight’s captain had died, but it was unclear when and no details about the pilot were released.\n“We are incredibly saddened by this event, and we are focused on caring for our pilot’s family and colleagues,” the airline's statement said.\nThe plane had 147 passengers and five crew members, American Airlines said told the Post-Standard in Syracuse.\nA replacement crew was headed to Syracuse to take passengers to Boston, and the passengers have since been taken there.\nBefore the flight landed, the first officer was heard telling the airport tower, “American 550. Medical emergency. Captain is incapacitated.”\n( Photo via Syracuse International Airport )\nJoseph Spector Albany bureau chief: Joseph Spector is Gannett's Albany Bureau chief and has covered New York politics and government since 2002.
