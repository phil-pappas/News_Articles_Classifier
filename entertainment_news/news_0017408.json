He was in town to perform during Pitt’s Midnight Madness basketball season kickoff Friday night. \nRepresentatives for Khalifa, who is known for hits such as “Black and Yellow” and “See You Again,” did not immediately return phone and email messages late Saturday from The Associated Press seeking comment on the citation, which is basically a ticket.
