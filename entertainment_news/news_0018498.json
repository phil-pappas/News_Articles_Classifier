If so, then bring it. Your country needs you to represent.”\nCanadians head to the polls on Oct. 19.\ndrake | federal election | voter turnout", "external_links": ["https://www.change.org/p/drake-are-you-coming-home-canada-needs-you"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:43:34.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
