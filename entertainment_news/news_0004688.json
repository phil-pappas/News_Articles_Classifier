There was considerable collaboration, between Dufresne and director Linda Oroszko, in bringing his work to a local stage, after its Off-Off Broadway premiere at The Blue Heron Theatre in 2005. By his account, it’s a tighter work, with more tempered comic flair, one that further benefits from some judicious interpretive choices Oroszko has made that give it both an added touch of intriguing ambiguity and piercing emotion.\nThe end result is a theatrical coup for all involved, and an auspicious debut for Worcester County Light Opera Company’s 2015-2016 season. Be advised that the opening weekend was sold out. If you’re lucky enough to snatch tickets for the closing weekend, you’ll be glad you did.\nIt takes place in the courtyard of a trailer park in Northeast Louisiana, over Labor Day weekend, at the beginning of the 21st century. The first time Pug (Kaity Ekstrom) opens the door to the trailer home stage left, we hear the soul-searing voice of Linda Ronstadt warbling “Blue Bayou.” And every time that door is opened, the music is as wildly varied as the nine characters that inhabit “Trailerville.”\nThe “marathon” that Pug often refers to is not the running type, but the Labor Day telethon that comedian Jerry Lewis hosted for decades. Across the way, in the other trailer, lives the memory-addled Bobby (Bill Sigalis), who spends his time pulling the string on a doll named Judy, and having conversations with her. Bobby’s wife, Merdelle (Brenda Jenkins), clings to whatever shreds she can of what she and Bobby once had. She’s become his caregiver, refusing to believe that he’s disappearing from her, thrusting old photos under his nose to revive his ravaged memories, changing his soiled clothes, and recoiling from his temperamental outbursts. She’s terrified of losing who she is in the process of losing Bobby. As she sadly tells Arlis (Tom Miller), “I used to have a husband. Now I have a puppy.”\nTwice divorced and living with his daughter Pug, Arlis is in love with Merdelle, and anticipates the day when Merdelle has no choice but to put Bobby in an assisted living home and they live together. As it is, things are mighty crowded in Pug’s trailer, which is the home to her 14-year-old son Theron (Zach Fuller), and two other young twins whom we never see. Most boisterous of all is Pug’s live-in boyfriend, Bromo (Christopher O’Connor), who has a Budweiser bottle attached to one hand while he’s lustfully slapping Pug’s behind with the other. Theron is in a funk, because the girl he has a crush on, Kristie (Lexie Fullen), is moving to California on Tuesday, and he’s trying to make the most of the time he has left with her.\nRounding out the colorful cast of characters are Bobby and Merdelle’s son, Willis (Al Dano), and his Bible-thumping wife Kitty-Bit (Cait Lubelczyk), who pay Mom and Dad a visit in Act 2, and provide abundant laughter with the clash of their religious zeal and Bromo’s irreverent comebacks.\nThe ensemble acting is of an extraordinarily high caliber, everyone deflecting stereotype with fleshed out personality and complexity. Dufresne cares deeply about his characters, whatever their shortcomings, and probably because of them. They’re memorably human. Sigalis conveys as much about Bobby with just a weary, haggard, confused look, or a shuffling stoop, as he does with a raspy, illogical non sequitur. He’s heartbreaking and funny in equal measure, giving a performance of quiet, devastating power.\nJenkins delivers a wrenching portrait of a woman torn between despair and hope. Even if Arlis can’t understand how and why Merdelle can still love Bobby, Jenkins’ fervent depiction of her makes sure that we do. Miller completes this tattered love triangle with his marvelously authentic, beautifully etched take on Arlis. By turns tender, frustrated, thoughtful, and subtly witty, Miller never gives you the impression that Arlis is emotionally selfish, but someone who has Merdelle’s best interests at heart.\nEkstrom’s dazzlingly imparted Pug is infectiously engaging, a fun-loving girl who embraces life on the fly, an ideal match for O’Connor’s amusingly blustery portrait of Bromo. These two are a perfectly imperfect pair of lovable rednecks who just want to have one continuous good time. Fuller and Fullen convey the pangs of first love with endearingly awkward believability. Lubelczyk and Dano are hilariously impassioned as Kitty-Bit and Willis, trying in vain to convert the unconvertible.\nEvan Wondolowski puts you right in the center of a trailer park with his splendidly conceived set design, consisting of tree branches framing the two trailers, with a clothesline drooped across the middle of the stage, and all of it under a blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. Vic Kruczynski’s sound and lighting enhance this environmental veracity with a knockout depiction of thunder and lightning, and the sweet chirping of a whip-poor-will. “Trailerville” skirts the razor-thin line of funny and sad with remarkable finesse and acuity, delivering a message of love and hope in its own inimitable way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:38:11.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
