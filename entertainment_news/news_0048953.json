Photo: Ten\nFans of the series have of course seen this all before.\nAdvertisement In this year's The Bachelor , the girls were lavished with jewellery from Zamels (who can forget that chunk of metal Sam gave Snezana?), while being ferried around in Nissan soccer mum cars.\nHowever, Thursday night's episode took things to a gross new level, and we were almost jolted out of our Bachelorette dream-state by the dazzling array of Oral B toothpaste in Sam Frost's bathroom.\nThe products in Thursday night's The Bachelorette. Photo: Ten\nThe stunning brunette was getting ready for her one-on-one date with charming Englishman Alex when we cut to a scene of perfectly arranged Oral B hygiene products.\nWhitening strips? Check. Whitening toothpaste? Check. Whitening mouth wash? You get the picture.\nThis was followed by even more product placement as Sam spritzed herself with a relatively-unknown perfume.\nThe guys tell Sam she \"smells amazing\" after spraying on some Axis perfume. Photo: Ten\nEven seedier still is the fact the guys keep telling Sam how nice she smells.\nWhen Sam made her big entrance at Thursday's cocktail party, the first thing 'professional soccer player' Michael (he's actually a real estate agent) told Sam was \"you smell amazing\".\nThat's some clever subliminal advertising, right there.\nSam spritzing herself with the perfume. Photo: Ten\nWe get it. Shows have to make money, and product placement from sponsors is something which has been happening on shows like The Block for years.\nThe Block is one of the masters of product placement, working Suzuki cars, Mitre 10 hammers and Android phones into nearly every shot.\nGot to pick up a lamp? To the Suzuki Swift. Need to find out where the plumber is? Call him on your Samsung Galaxy.\nLana and her Nissan before having her heart broken on The Bachelor. Photo: Ten\nWhile shows like The Bachelorette aren't any different, is certainly ruins the audience experience.\nWho can forget the abysmal Sex and the City 2 which assaulted fans for more than two hours with dozens of different products.\nThere was also The Biggest Loser last year when trainer Shannon Ponton lectured his team about the benefits of krill oil, before presenting them with some Nature's Way Super Krill Oil.\nNine's The Block is the master of product placement, as seen with this Suzuki hot lap challenge. Photo: Nine\nBoth Ponton and Michelle Bridges are ambassadors for Nature's Way, a major sponsor of The Biggest Loser .\nAs The Bachelor and The Bachelorette become even bigger cash cows from Ten, there's no doubt we'll be seeing more cheeky product placement.\nWhile we doubt it's enough to turn viewers away from the series which has become a national zeitgeist, it's hard not to feel like the networks are treating Australians as bunch of mugs.\nProduct placement, brought to you by the bachelorette... #BacheloretteAU\n— Kat Stewart (@BonsaiPanda) October 1, 2015 All this product placement in the bachelorette is bloody shameful #BacheloretteAU\n— Nohemy Vivas (@nohemyvivas) October 1, 2015 Omg the Oral B product placement on the Bachelorette is so fkn bad\n— caitlin (@caitlinbarbieri) October 1, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nohemyvivas/status/649519138495332353", "http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/the-bachelorette-australia-2015-sam-frost-shares-passionate-kiss-with-sasha-mielczarek-20150930-gjyizv.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/the-bachelorette-why-bromance-is-the-best-part-of-sam-frosts-search-for-love-20150924-gjtmzb.html", "https://twitter.com/caitlinbarbieri/status/649536294305972224", "https://twitter.com/BonsaiPanda/status/649519250340577280", "http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/the-bachelorette-australia-2015-will-stoker-and-kieran-nicholas-sent-home-20151001-gjzfw1.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BacheloretteAU?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:41:41.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
