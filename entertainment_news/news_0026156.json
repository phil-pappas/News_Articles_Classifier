Of course I will also miss Dr S'Avage - he's been a dream part to play and getting to kiss Anna Passey, Zoe Lucker and Stephanie Waring was just the icing on the cake. \"Working with other talented artistes like David Kennedy, Helen Lederer and of course not forgetting my 'Angels' - Jess, Daisy, Sarah and Sophie - have all added to this gift of a part.\"Even though Dr S'Avage wasn't a real doctor, I think all he ever wanted was a wing at Dee Valley Hospital named after him, with a big theatrical opening and Sienna, his love, to unveil it.\" © Lime PicturesS'Avage and the Gloved Hand suspects S'Avage has spent the past few weeks probing the Gloved Hand Killer mystery at the hospital.
