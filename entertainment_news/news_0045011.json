The caller was following the thief at 40th Street and Waterman Avenue, and officers joined in at 30th Street and Waterman, San Bernardino police Lt. Rich Lawhead said.\nThe man was driving with a woman who wanted to exit the vehicle, but the driver refused to let her go. The officers tried to pull the man over, but he refused to stop, the lieutenant said.\nThe chase lasted six minutes and ended when the suspect stopped the vehicle near 24th Street and Carlton Street, jumped out and stormed into a nearby house. A 13-year-old child then ran out, quickly found officers and led them to the home, Lawhead said.\nThe officers entered and detained the suspect, who resisted arrest, he said.\nThe suspect's name was not available Saturday evening.\nContact the writer: psurowski@pe.com, 951-368-9548, follow him on Twitter at @PeterSurowski and like him on Facebook.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-defaultbreakingnews.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Surowski/400842793294688", "http://www.twitter.com/petersurowski", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-defaultbreakingnews.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:09:23.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
