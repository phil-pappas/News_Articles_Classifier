Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly Fall 2016 is the year of incredible season premieres and \" The Vampire Diaries \" is no exception. Fans wondered what would happen with Nina Dobrev gone from the show. Even though it was hard to imagine \"TVD\" without Elena, the season premiere did not disappoint. So, what is in store for \"The Vampire Diaries\" season 7, episode 2? On Oct. 11, Christian Today posted some spoilers for the upcoming episode, titled \" Never Let Me Go .\"\nCaroline will be in danger, with Lily and the Heretics using her as a pawn, as the synopsis put it. Enzo, who said he was her friend, has obviously switched sides. However, Caroline will also find out some information about Stefan's past that shocks her. Could this shocking information be connected to the lady with the crossbow who is after Stefan in the three-year flash forward?\nAs for Damon and Stefan's mother, Lily, she wants revenge. Malcolm was killed and the truce is no longer valid. \"The Vampire Diaries\" season 7, episode 2 synopsis , provided by CWTV Source, reveals that Damon will try to fix things before they get out of control. However, Lily is one step ahead of her son and hits him where it hurts the most. Damon is pretty guarded, even after seven seasons, but he loves Elena and has a special bond with Bonnie. Since Elena is sleeping for 60 years and she is presumably in a coffin in the flash forward, Bonnie could be Lily's next target.\nAnother interesting detail revealed about \"The Vampire Diaries\" season 7, episode 2 by Christian Today is that Stefan may switch to Lily's side. The promo does tease that \"a family is at war.\" However, it's hard to imagine Stefan siding with his mother. However, he will do what is necessary to save everyone. Could this be a plan of his to try to keep the peace and save everyone's lives?\nFind out what happens when \"The Vampire Diaries\" season 7, episode 2 airs on Oct. 15.", "external_links": ["http://cwtvsource.com/2015/09/26/the-vampire-diaries-7x02-synopsis-never-let-me-go/", "http://www.christiantoday.com/article/the.vampire.diaries.s7.e2.spoilers.lily.gets.furious.enzo.tortures.caroline/67228.htm"], "published": "2015-10-12T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:17:13.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
