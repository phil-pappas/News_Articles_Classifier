Some [stories] are little more gory and scary while others are more sweet and cute.\"\nKerrigan describes this year's show is similar to \"The Nutcracker,\" erring on the \"sweet and cute\" end of the spectrum of supernatural stories.\n\"My character starts as an old woman who falls asleep in a chair and wakes up magically in a complete different costume, as a princess,\" Kerrigan said. \"The pink princess turns into a vampire queen by the end of Act One.\"\nKerrigan's oldest son, Matthew, designed all her costumes and the attire of the witches in the show. All the costume changes take place right on the ice.\n\"People are like, 'How did that happen?'\" Kerrigan said. \"Even a few weeks ago, Kurt [Browning] kept asking how we were going to do this. I'm just wearing a lot of layers.\"\nKerrigan's costumes won't be the only jaw-droppers on the ice. On Oct. 8, three-time U.S. national skating champion Johnny Weir shared a look at his \"Halloween on Ice\" costume (below). Something tells us his character may be responsible for the Kerrigan's transition into a vampire queen.\nAnd so it begins...@halloweenonice Opening Night! #bloodymary\nA photo posted by JOHNNY WEIR (@johnnygweir) on Oct 8, 2015 at 3:59pm PDT\nKerrigan remembers the 1996 \"Halloween on Ice\" had a \"bad\" effect on the younger audiences. About 24 glow-in-the-dark skeletons came out to Kerrigan from under a bed.\n\"It wasn't bloody or gory, but kids were crying,\" she said. \"We decided that's not what we want to do. Some parents love it, but we can do Halloween story lines without having to be scary.\"\nKerrigan can relate to concerned parents. She says the hardest part of being on tour is being away from her younger kids, and figuring out who's going to drive them to their gymnastics and ballet practices at home. (Her children Brian, 10, and Nicole, 7, will travel to see her \"Halloween on Ice\" performance next weekend.)\n\"They have their own stuff,\" Kerrigan said. \"I can't let my things make their life stop. Typically, I'm at home driving them around. People ask, 'Why don't you coach [skating]?' If I were to do that, then I couldn't be there for my own kids.\"\nAt home, Kerrigan's Olympic medals aren't on display. She keeps them in a travel bag to bring to events so young people can see them. On Thursday, there will be a post show meet-and-greet for skating fans to meet the stars.\n\"It's been a while since I've been back to Syracuse but I liked it there and I'm looking forward to coming back,\" Kerrigan said.\nNancy Kerrigan's Halloween On Ice\nWhere: The Oncenter War Memorial Arena, Syracuse, NY\nWhen: Thursday, Oct. 15 at 7 p.m.\nHow much: Tickets range from $25 to $85 and are on sale via Ticketmaster.com, by phone at 800-745-3000 or at the Solvay Bank Box Office at the Oncenter.
