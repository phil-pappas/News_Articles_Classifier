ABS-CBN’s news site abs-cbnnews.com remains to be the most viewed online site in the country at number one. \nAlexa is a website that runs analytics for internet traffic and monitors website traffic and interaction. \nAnother highlight for ABS-CBN Entertainment’s online portal is its YouTube channel, ABS-CBN Entertainment, which has breached the two billion view mark, the highest in the Philippines. It also boasts the biggest subscriber base in the country of over two million. This puts the channel ahead of Kids’ Toys, which is now part of ABS-CBN’s Chicken Pork Adobo multi-channel network, which ranks second, and ABS-CBNNews.com, which ranks third. \n“Our YouTube channel has become a significant revenue contributor for online. We have reached rank 17 in global ranking, with 58 million views for just one week. Worthy to note though that last year, the average views hover in the vicinity of 10-12 million a week, compared to this year’s high of 58 million views a week. This gives us an indication of the shifting media consumption and behavior of our audiences,” said Richard Reynante, head of ABS-CBN digital content publishing. \nAside from that, the Kapamilya network’s Facebook page (ABS-CBN) also continues to have the strongest following and community in the media category in the country, hitting 11 million Likes and reaching out to more than 24 million people on the social media network. \nThe numbers, data, and rankings continue to prove that the Kapamilya online community, with the help of its subscribers, followers, and fans, continue to be strong in the online entertainment category.
