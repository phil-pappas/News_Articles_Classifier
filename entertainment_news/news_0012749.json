Thomas Libous' fight to have his felony conviction tossed, ruling that the evidence presented to jurors in July was enough to show he lied to the FBI. U.S. District Judge Vincent Briccetti late last week denied a series of motions filed by Libous' attorney, which had argued the jury's conviction was based on insufficient evidence and sought an acquittal or a new trial.\nA Binghamton Republican, Libous, 62, was convicted in White Plains federal court in July of lying to the FBI about a 2005 scheme to get his son a $150,000-a-year job with Santangelo, Randazzo & Mangone, then a politically connected Westchester County law firm.\nIn his decision Friday, Briccetti said the evidence backs up the jury's verdict.\n\"The only question is whether the evidence taken as a whole and construed in a light most favorable to the government supports the jury’s verdict,\" Briccetti wrote. \"It does.\"\nThe latest decision sets the stage for a possible appeal from Libous, whose conviction forced him from the Senate seat he had held since 1989. But an appeal can't be filed until Libous is sentenced, which is scheduled for Oct. 30.\nAt trial, federal prosecutors argued Libous lied seven times to FBI agents during an interview in 2010, when they were investigating Libous' role in his son's employment.\nThe prosecutors accused Libous of getting his son, Matthew, a job with the Westchester firm by promising to steer work in their direction, along with arranging for Albany lobbying outfit Ostroff, Hiffa & Associates to cover a third of his $150,000-a-year salary.\nIn his post-trial motions, Libous attorney Paul DerOhanessian raised a number of legal issues in hopes of overturning the conviction, pointing to everything from the location of the trial to the credibility of the prosecution's main witness, now-disbarred attorney Anthony Mangone.\nBriccetti was not persuaded.\n\"Mangone’s testimony, in combination with the other evidence presented, was sufficient to support the verdict,\" the judge wrote. \"To be sure, Mangone was the government’s key witness, and his credibility was effectively attacked on cross-examination, in summation, and otherwise throughout the trial. But it was entirely a jury question whether to credit Mangone’s testimony.\"\n(Photo by Ricky Flores/The Journal News)\nHere's the decision:\nLibous Decision\n>", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/embeds/283721230/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/283721230/Libous-Decision"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:38:12.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
