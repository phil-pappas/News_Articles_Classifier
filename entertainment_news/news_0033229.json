The concert theme, “Toward a New Horizon,” refers to the beginning of the group’s next quarter-century. The program will include popular and inspiring music, as well as a seasonal Halloween-themed musical treat. The Main Street Jazz Band and the Mill Creek Jazz Ensemble will play a variety of standards in big band-style arrangements. This is WWVB’s first concert under the direction of Jackson Maberry, a Whitman College graduate with a master’s degree in choral conducting from the University of Cambridge. Maberry helped the band work toward a focused, unified sound. He is supported by Assistant Conductor Jonathan Butler, a music and band teacher in Helix. Tickets are available at the door and Book & Game Co., at $10 general admission or $5 for students and seniors. For more information, call 509-540-1166 or see wwvalleybands.org.
