The author's idea is a clever one and her talent for writing is evident. The story is quite captivating and heartwarming. The characters are fully drawn and intriguing. McHenry has a talent for storytelling. It would be interesting should she choose to write another book because the potential is there. Her style is reminiscent of Dorothy Garlock, who is well known for homespun period romances,” said reader and critic Valerie Porter.\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Frances McHenry’s poignant tale details the main character’s and author’s creative way of overcoming her own insecurities through story telling. “I Can Only Imagine Dad” shares Frances McHenry's story of how she came into existence-whether real or imaginary. The story steps through real events of time like World War I and World War II, as she imagines them. As a new author, Mrs. McHenry has imagined and woven together a very vivid account of what may have been the story of how her two biological parents came together.\nAs a young girl, Frances yearned so badly for the love of a father. She would imagine herself walking around like the young bird in P.D. Eastman's book, \"Are You My Mother?\" A seasoned storyteller in her book \"I Can Only Imagine Dad\", Frances is symbolically searching and asking everyone she comes into contact with the lifelong question that she is still asking today - Are You My Father?
