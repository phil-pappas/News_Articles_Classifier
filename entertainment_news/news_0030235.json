(Photo: TRIBUNE PHOTO/RION SANDERS) Buy Photo \nThe Ski and Board Swap offers great deals on new and used ski and snowboard equipment. \nThe Swap is Friday and Saturday at the Trades and Industries Building at the Montana ExpoPark. \n“There’s stuff from low end to high end,” said Kari Cann of the Great Falls Ski and Board Swap. \nThe Swap is a great chance to outfit an entire family at the fraction of the price that gear would cost retail, she said. \n“We’ll have folks around that can help you fit skis and boots,” Cann said. \nThe event includes everything from skis and snowboards to soft goods, such as jackets, hats and gloves. \nThe swap runs from 5-9 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday. \nIn addition to buying new gear, people can also take advantage of the Ski Swap to sell their old gear. \n“It’s a good way to recycle old stuff or get new stuff,” she said. \nItems to be sold on consignment can be dropped off between noon Friday and 10 a.m. Saturday. All items not sold need to be picked up by 3 p.m. Saturday. People can also opt to donate them to Eagle Mount and Special Olympics. \nThe Ski Swap does not sell old straight skis. However, people can bring them to the event to be given away. \nIn addition to consignment items, an out-of-state vendor will be on hand with a truckload of equipment. \nBighorn Outdoor Specialists will have a table, and Seneca Boards, a custom ski company out of Bozeman, will also be there. \nShowdown and Teton Pass will have booths at the swap, as will Eagle Mount. \nThe Ski and Board Swap serves as a fundraiser for the Great Falls Ski and Board Club. The groups uses proceeds to promote skiing and snowboarding in northcentral Montana.
