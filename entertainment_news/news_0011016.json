All proceeds from the skateboard deck sales go to Pad Paws.\n\"This was a great way to give back to the community while allowing our artists to express their creativity and use their talents in a different way,\" said Christina Seeber, Marketing Manager. \"This is the first time we've done this, and part of our philosophy is to keep this charitable outreach going.\"\nPete Doty, Lead Instructor at A.R.T. Jersey City, organized the Ink on Deck Fundraiser. He said the idea came to him after seeing an apprentice come in with a skateboard he had painted.\n\"I instantly had a vision of every apprentice painting one and what a great art show that would make,\" Doty said. \"After the vision, all the work was organizing. I realized that I could do something so large scale with such ease because I had several tattoo shops filled with artists that could participate.\"\nOnce Doty had the idea for the fundraiser, he and the rest of the team at A.R.T. Jersey City chose Pad Paws as the event's chosen charity.\n\"Pad Paws is a local organization we chose, since every one of us seems to love cats,\" he said. \"There were even skateboards with cats on them. We wanted a nonprofit that helped animals in Jersey City that needed our help and that was Pad Paws.\"\nSo far, the Ink on Deck Fundraiser has been a major success for both A.R.T. and Pad Paws, Doty said.\n\"So far we have raised $400 and we're keeping the boards up at Tea NJ for another month to raise additional funds for Pad Paws,\" he said.\nPaul Anthony, A.R.T Founder, said the fundraiser allowed the studio's tattoo artists to showcase their talent in a unique new way while doing good for the community.\n“The event helped to illustrate the amazing talent within our apprentices, showcasing the potential they have in transferring their artistic talents in one medium. We found their works very inspiring,” Anthony said.\nAbout Academy of Responsible Tattooing (A.R.T.)\nLocated in Brooklyn, Jersey City, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Academy of Responsible Tattooing allows aspiring tattoo artists to advance their career through extensive training.
