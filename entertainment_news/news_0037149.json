Vin Diesel with his parents Delora and Irving Vincent, partner Paloma Jimenez and daughter Hania (Alex J Berliner/AP) \n“I think a lot of that comes from being raised by a father who’s a theatre director and you know I don’t rest on laurels and maybe I should more. I’m always thinking about what’s outstanding.” \nVin, who next stars in The Last Witch Hunter alongside Sir Michael Caine, joked he brought him out of retirement. Michael Caine and Vin Diesel (Ian West/PA) \n“It was always a dream of mine to work with Michael Caine. We’ve been friends for 13 years when he first got the call,” he said. \n“He said, ‘I don’t even have a driver’s licence, what does he want me for Fast And Furious?’ but supposedly it got him out of retirement. He said it was a role that he couldn’t refuse and again we were keen on working with one and another.” Promoted stories \nFilming for The Last Witch Hunter had to be pushed back, as a knock-on effect as the shoot for Fast And Furious 7 was delayed following the untimely death of Paul Walker in November 2013. \n“I was passionate about this from day one. It’s tricky because I couldn’t have foreseen what happened at the end of 2013 so I couldn’t imagine what 2014 was really going to be like,” Vin said. \n“I was supposed to do The Last Witch Hunter prior to Furious 7 and after Fast And Furious 6, the studio was just so aggressive about getting underway with Furious 7 but overall I was very excited about doing something different.” \nThe 48-year-old star continued: “I approach every film and every character the same way and with the same integrity. \n“It doesn’t matter if it’s a courtroom drama directed by Sidney Lumet or a huge temple action film, I still invest every part of me into that character and want to find the truth in that character and the meaning of the whole movie. I’ve been lucky.” Share article \nThe Last Witch Hunter opens in UK cinemas on October 21.
