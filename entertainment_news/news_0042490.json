The U.S. Attorney's Office announced Tuesday that Charles Hanks has pleaded guilty to mail fraud before a federal judge in Rochester.\nProsecutors say Hanks, Ricky Miller and a Jamaican group operated a fraudulent sweepstakes telemarketing scheme that involved calling elderly people and telling them that they had won a sweepstakes prize or lottery. The individuals were then asked to pay an upfront fee in order to release the winnings.\nOfficials say Hanks and Miller received about $300,000 from the victims and sent it to Jamaica after taking a cut.\nMiller was convicted and is awaiting sentencing.\nHanks faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he's sentenced Jan. 5.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
