I think we won 3-1 and I thought ‘fantastic, it must always be like this’ and then we didn’t win for the next 20 games.” \nJeff, who has presented the Sky show for 20 years, said he is prepared to do anything to help the team. \nHe said: “I’ll be as active as they want me to be. Anything I can do to promote the club I’m happy to do so.” Share article \nThe father-of-three also said he struggles to contain his excitement whenever Hartlepool goal flashes up on the vidiprinter. \nDuring the 2008-09 season he used a toy doll of American soul singer James Brown that sang ‘I feel good’ whenever his team scored a goal.
