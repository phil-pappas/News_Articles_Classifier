If convicted, Stamos may face six months in county jail; he is scheduled to be arraigned Friday.\nIn mid-June, the 51-year-old Fuller House cast member was arrested and cited for DUI before being brought to a Beverly Hills hospital for treatment. On Twitter, Stamos reported at the time he was feeling \"grateful\" for the support of his family and friends following the incident.\nIn July, Stamos checked himself into rehab to undergo treatment for substance abuse.\nLast month, he told Details magazine the citation was a turning point in his life that forced him to prioritize. \"You know, I've had a rough year with my mom dying, so it all came to a head,\" he said. \"You either continue on that path -- and some of it's fun, but a lot of it's not -- or there's this other thing, this golden opportunity sitting there with all this work and all this goodwill that you have going for you.
