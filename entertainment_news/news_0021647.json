It’s fun and family-friendly; trying earnestly to understand young people, without making any chaperones in the audience feel left out. It’s also predictable, presenting a theme about artistic independence that is a complete contradiction. And then there’s that robot — looking like it escaped from the last “Transformers” film.\nMore Information Jem and the Holograms\n★★\nQuick take: A decnet film with a condradictory message\nThat’s actually a viable theory. Both movies are based on Hasbro creations, trying to simultaneously capitalize on Generation X’s love of nostalgia and the short attention spans of whatever this generation of ‘tweens is going to be called. The goal here is a bazillion dollars in merchandise, and a hastily made sequel with a stylized title (“Jem and the Hologram2”?) that looks good on a movie poster.\n“Nashville” star Aubrey Peeples is a solid choice as Jem, the least outgoing but most talented of four sisters who have music in their blood. A flurry of mistakes, coincidences and double-crosses turn her into an internet sensation. Lured by mega-producer Erica Raymond ( Juliette Lewis , channeling equal parts Anna Wintour and Cruella de Vil), Jem must decide whether to become a solo act, save her aunt’s home and solve a mystery that is linked to her artistic future.\nIn addition to the robot, here are the other three most weirdly distracting things in “Jem,” in no particular order.\nAll of the girls appear to be between 14 and 20 years old, and their schooling isn’t mentioned once during the entire film.\nJem’s dead father sends her on a byzantine scavenger hunt, involving several misdemeanors and at least one felony, so she can receive information he could have just written on an index card and handed to a notary.\nLewis and Ryan Guzman play mother and son, despite appearing to be maybe nine years apart in age.\nThe scenes with Lewis are some of the most entertaining, but they also sink the film’s central moral that it’s OK to be yourself and buck the corporate bad guys. Jem’s fight against an evil profit-centric record company comes in a movie made by a profit-centric movie studio, co-produced by a toy company CEO and the guy who represents Justin Bieber . It’s like watching a film that decries the exploitation of whales, financed by Sea World with Captain Ahab attached as an executive producer.\nTo be fair, there are positives that come from these alliances as well. Much like the completely satisfactory Bieber concert film “Never Say Never,” the “Jem” movie has a nice understanding of fame, fandom and the power of social media. “Jem and the Holograms” weaves in its 21st century vibe without feeling forced or self-conscious.\nAnd to balance the modern touches, there are 1980s references galore, beginning and ending with the greatest 1980s totem of them all: Molly Ringwald starring as Jem’s aunt. This is the most full-circle part of the film - with Ringwald basically playing the Paul Dooley kind father role from “Sixteen Candles.”\nThe movie ends (minor spoiler here) with a speech (“We’re all Jem!”) extremely similar to the one Sylvester Stallone made at the end of “Rocky IV.” That movie also had a robot, a lot of montages and made less sense the more you thought about it. Everything eventually comes back in style …\nRunning time: 108 minutes\nMPAA rating: PG (reckless behavior, suggestive content, profanity)", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/46/8837550/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/46/8837550/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:02:15.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
