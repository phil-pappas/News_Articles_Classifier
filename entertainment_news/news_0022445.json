Both enjoyed their experiences but lamented that the business was not in the Rochester area.\n“I thought, gee, maybe we could do this back home,” said Bandych, a city resident. “Then, I approached Jane.”\nNewhouse concurred. The women bought into the Massage Envy franchise opportunity and opened the first such local spa in Pittsford in 2010. They now own four Massage Envy Spas in the Rochester area, having since added branches in Webster (2011), Greece (2012) and Victor (2013). David Bandych, Rachel’s husband, and Jason Ksczanowicz, an associate of Newhouse, are the other co-owners.\nBuy Photo Top Workplaces 2015 (Photo: File photo)\nMassage Envy was named to this year’s Democrat and Chronicle “Top Workplaces” list , one of the only franchise businesses to make the list. Newhouse said the parent company has been great, and Bandych said the award “means the world to me.”\n“When your own people on your own team are saying you’re doing a great job, that’s terrific reaffirmation of what we’re doing,” she said. The “Top Workplaces” are voted on by employees.\nBuy Photo Massage Envy is holding an October promotion supporting the Open Door Mission.

Members of the Buffalo Bills visited the Pittsford spa during training camp, Bandych said. Female pro golfers and baseball umpires also have been customers to the local spas, but the clientele is far more than those in the athletic field.\n“We have members as young as nine and as old as 90,” Newhouse said. The services “are used for various ailments, aches and pains, like sports recovery. They’re also for people who have trouble sleeping, for students during exam time, for motor vehicle accident victims, for people who are on their feet a lot and more.”\nMembers can use their memberships at any of the Massage Envy Spas throughout the country. The company has nearly 1,100 outlets in 49 of the 50 states, Newhouse said. (Only Wyoming, for whatever reason, has none, she said.)\n“It’s great for snowbirds, who can use their memberships in Florida,” Bandych said. “It’s seamless.”\nThe business started in Scottsdale, Ariz. in 2003. The company has been opening 100 or so spas annually the past few years, Newhouse said. When she and Bandych got involved, the closest Massage Envy Spas were in the Pittsburgh area; now they’re also in the Buffalo area, and Newhouse and Bandych have expanded to the Syracuse region.\nBandych was a lawyer by trade and Newhouse was involved in construction materials brokerage. They met at Brook Lea Country Club years ago. Massage Envy’s “great business model” convinced them to buy franchises.\n“It’s a developing trend,” Newhouse said. “People want to go above and beyond the gym membership. People were looking at building a healthier lifestyle, and they wanted to feel better.”\nThe parent company helped with site plans and other support to get the local spas started. Massage therapists typically have been educated at schools like the Onondaga School of Therapeutic Massage and the Finger Lakes School of Massage.\nThe local Massage Envy Spas are open seven days a week, including night-time hours Mondays through Saturdays.\nAlan Morrell is a Rochester-based freelance writer.\nMassage Envy Spas\nLocations: Local branches are at 2833 West Ridge Road in Greece; 3400 Monroe Ave. (Pittsford Colony) in Pittsford; 900 Holt Road in Webster; and 7553 Commons Blvd. in Victor.\nFounded: The national company started in 2003. The local franchises began opening in 2010.\nExecutives: Jane Newhouse, Rachel Bandych, David Bandych and Jason Ksczanowicz, co-owners.\nWebsite: www.massageenvy.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/070c20ae0e40acdab1d712b9cd0114ef3113ba7d/c=45-101-430-615&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Rochester/B9318852712Z.1_20150918002943_000_GOKBV9P4H.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/B9319052326Z.1_20151002145443_000_G6NC3IHLP.1-0.jpg", "http://www.massageenvy.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/45f5641c161df61cf6fcf73f640b682855ab3409/r=222x400/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Rochester/B9318852712Z.1_20150918002943_000_GOKBV9P4H.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/18/Rochester/B9318852712Z.1_20150918002943_000_GOKBV9P4H.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4edc83e488b64aa5ca4f6e8329a23d489e87a606/r=267x400/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/B9319052326Z.1_20151002145443_000_G6NC3IHLP.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/99663543b9444802ab69c0109ef50f53a7392b11/c=0-132-1602-2268&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Rochester/B9319052326Z.1_20151002145443_000_G6NC3IHLP.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:34:21.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
