YouTube star Austin Criswell to perform at Tellus360 Comments MARK PONTZ \nAustin Criswell, a musician who has developed a large following on Youtube, will perform at Tellus360 on Wednesday, Oct. 14. \nWhen Austin Criswell began uploading songs to YouTube, he never thought anyone would actually watch them. \nThe 26-year-old from Mount Holly Springs in Cumberland County figured it would be a good way to store songs he was working on so he wouldn’t forget them. He then started recording cover songs for fun, paying homage to artists he loves such as John Mayer, The Lumineers and Eric Clapton. \nOne of those covers — a reinterpretation of Death Cab for Cutie’s “I’ll Follow You Into the Dark” — garnered more than 3 million views. \n“I think I was like a few days late to the party, because someone messaged me, one of my friends from high school, and was like, ‘You realize you’re on the front page of Reddit,’\\!q ” Criswell says. Reddit is a website where users share popular links. The most popular links end up on the site’s front page. “I was like, ‘No, I didn’t.’\\!q ” \nThe YouTube star will be playing a show with friend Adam Blessing at Tellus360 on Wednesday. The show is part of A&E Audiology’s “Random Acts of Music,” a community engagement series to raise awareness about hearing loss and the importance of wearing earplugs at concerts. \nAnother cover of Criswell’s, a ukulele rendition of Coldplay’s emotional “Fix You,” was shared by the Huffington Post in January 2014. \nAll the buzz has worked in Criswell’s favor. His YouTube channel, ACMusic7, has more than 136,500 subscribers. A Facebook fan page for his music has upwards of 16,000 likes, and he has 2,800 Twitter followers. \nHis reach is arguably more impressive when considering his lack of musical training. Criswell is self-taught in both guitar and voice. He was never in choir, band or any formal lesson environment. \n“I always just sang with the radio and stuff, and in the shower,” Criswell says. “My mom, she has a hair salon in her house. … If I would be in the shower and stuff singing, she would bring her customers up to listen to me and stuff secretly, because I hated singing in front of people.” \nHe says he took his mom’s compliments with a grain of salt though, because “moms automatically have to believe that their kids are good.” \nIt wasn’t until age 16 when he performed at an arts show at Boiling Springs High School that he realized he had something special. He says the audience wanted him to perform more after his slot was over. But getting there wasn’t without its trials: Criswell says stage fright still plagues him today. \n“Oh, I wanted to die,” Criswell says of what he was feeling before his first public performance. “I did not handle it well. I still don’t handle anxiety very well. I’m always terrified before a show.” \nHe copes with it now by making a playlist of his set before a show, and playing it on the car ride there. He sings along with it as a warmup. \n“I always know after the first song I’ll be alright,” Criswell says. “I always just tell myself to try to get through one song and I’ll be able to handle it, then.” \nWhen Criswell performs at Tellus360, he’ll treat audiences to a mix of both covers and originals. He released an EP “Maybe, Someday” in March 2014, self-recorded on GarageBand. He hopes to record a full-length album in a professional studio in the near future. \nWhile he’s best known for his covers, writing and performing original music has always been part of Criswell’s goal. He describes his music as sometimes depressing, and always driven by emotions. \n“The very first song I wrote was for a girl, so it kind of, like, headed in that direction,” Criswell says. “So every time I felt something for a girl, I wrote a song. Almost every single song I’ve ever written that is that sort of tone can be pointed at a person.” IF YOU GO: \nRandom Acts of Music with Austin Criswell (with Adam Blessing) \nWhere: Tellus360, 24 E.
