In studio though, Nick would sing them two different ways depending on his mood. We decided to mix the two together and found it really worked.\" Coupled with the lead guitar, reminiscent of late 60's psychodelia, the song has may layers of sounds that create a fantastic journey.\nThis single, which is available on the Jewell Thieves' website, is also a streaming single, having been released through TuneCore and can be found on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon Music, Google Play and many other stores. You can also hear all their music on the Jewell Thieves Radio Station.\nAbout the Jewell Thieves and Visionary[s]\nThe Jewell Thieves are a father and son, independent, Boston-based alternative rock band, bringing attention to 11-year-old singer, Nick Jewell and a mix of music styles that make listening to independent music fun.
