The toss gave both teams an equal betting chance. By halftime, it was 30-0, and it was obvious that Texas lost the bigger bet, with virtually no chance of winning the game. The futility was not because it is impossible to come back from a 30-point deficit. The futility was in what appeared to be the Texas lack of willingness to compete – moments after that coin toss.That last type of futility lies at the doorstep of the head coach Charlie Strong. He must own the responsibility to have his team ready to play. Obviously, the team had the demoralizing hangover from two straight heartbreaking defeats. But the buck still stops with the head coach, especially when it ended in a 50-7 blowout.And then there is the alleged half time retweet by freshman Longhorns cornerback Kris Boyd about wanting to transfer. That implies a coach’s lack of control over, and an inability to keep his players focused on the task at hand. That too lies at Strong’s doorstep. Some would say the situation is spiraling out of control.[caption id=\"attachment_487064768\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] SOUTH BEND, IN - SEPTEMBER 05: Head coach Charlie Strong of the Texas Longhorns on the sidelines during the game against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Notre Dame Stadium on September 5, 2015 in South Bend, Indiana. (Photo by Jon Durr/Getty Images)[/caption]Not surprisingly, the whispers for a change are now screams. And those who said “No” to his hiring would say “Hell No” now to keeping Strong another year. Similar words were tweeted from the Texas Rangers social media department: “FireCharlie.# bye”. The sender was fired or otherwise dissociated from the Rangers. Longhorns Mega-boosters cannot be so easily dismissed.So obviously, the unavoidable question facing the school president is whether Strong will be fired during the season, after the season, or not at all.The ultimate answer doesn’t come until after some other questions are resolved.Yes, the Longhorns have become the Shorthorns. But that did not happen when Strong arrived. The horn-shaving starting before that. Every school has a talent pipeline of 4 to 5 years because that is the player’s tenure on the team. That pipeline cannot dry up all at once. A drastic siphoning of talent can only happen over several years. A talented freshman is still talented and typically increasing in skill over the next three to four years if he redshirts. So if Texas has a total talent deficit it started several years before Strong got there.But even if that were true, Strong is still on the hook to answer this question: “Why hasn’t he turned it around by now?”One answer could be, “He’s a bad coach.” But he was resoundingly regarded by his peers as an excellent coach before he arrived. He did not become a bad coach by simply driving across state lines.That leads to the equally fair question: “How long should get to turn it around?”A transition and even the rumors of it hurt the program at this stage. There’s an old 16 th century saying, “The drama of life is in the transitions.” In the life of a wide-eyed 18 year old recruits, they do not want the drama of not knowing who will be their surrogate father for the next four or five years. Texas is not getting the top talent now, the rumors of Strong’s demise will make it even harder to attract the best players.A new coach has to assemble a staff. He will probably not get everyone he wants. He has to establish a game plan and have his scheme, his brand of football. Those are uncertainties. No business, including the business of college football, likes uncertainty. Recruits don’t like it either.And if Texas fires him, it will likely have to pay him quite well for the “at will” firing. Then there is a new cost to hire another coach. Both types of transactions will cost Texas millions. Not that Texas doesn’t have the money. But it also knows that just throwing money to a problem, like throwing a pass at a receiver, does not guarantee success.These are the opportunity costs to be weighted by the Texas decision makers. Are the downsides of a transition greater than the benefits of a Strong retention?The president will be weighing those costs against the benefit of keeping Strong. This year’s team was a botched punt and a special teams blunder away from a 3-1 record going into this last game. Those blunders allowed them to snatch defeat from the warm jaws of victory against Cal (44-45) and against undefeated Oklahoma State (27-30). The difference being a combined total of 4 points.Those are hollow rationalizations, far from the equivalent of wins. But they clearly indicate that Strong has gained ground and closed the talent gap based on the first four games. The transitional costs of starting over with a new coach seem too high at this point. If he is already close to winning based on the first four games, and if the last game was an aberration, then to fire him after this season would be a step backward.Sure, there are coaches who are turnaround experts who could make the transitional costs worth the risk. But Jim Harbaugh is off the market.And then there’s the talent deficit.There is another old axiom, “A rising tide floats all boats.” That is like saying a good economy (the tide) helps even the poor businessman (a bad boat) succeed. But in the reality college football, some programs sink. Texas has been sinking for a while – sinking in its ability to get the best players in the state of Texas. Now Texas can be objectively characterized as third in the state, behind TCU and Texas A & M. Looking at all the Texas players on the Oklahoma roster in recent years, you may even put Texas fourth.“Why is that?” “How did that happen?”Some may say that’s in the past and it does not matter. But history helps us connect the dots between what was and what is – and more importantly why things now are the way they are. The more we know why we have a problem, the better our solution to that problem. The better we know how deep the hole, the better we know how long it will take to climb out of it.As applied, there are reasons why the Longhorns have become the Shorthorns within the state. Texas football was the top steer for more than a half century. Anyone who suggested that a TC-who or Texas A & M would be branding the steer would have been called delusional.But something has been going on for several years before Strong arrived on campus. I don’t know what it is, but I have my suspicions. What I do know is that the slow painful demise of tradition-rich programs has some common causes, none of which start with the current head coach. Until those problems are admitted and addressed, the solutions do not magically appear.The length of time required to get it right has to do with how bad it was when the recovery started. If Texas fires Strong after this year, I suspect the program is in a deeper hole than the administration realizes. There is not usually a quick fix to a long-festering problem. Texas A & M and TCU are now perennial powers. They are not going to stop recruiting just to let Texas can catch up. For whatever reasons, those schools have been doing something that resonates with the top recruits and their parents that Texas has not done, and it’s not a disparity in facilities or money.If the last game was truly an aberration, the administration should probably look past this last game embarrassment to take the longer reasoned view that they are still climbing, not sinking, and that the hole was deeper than the naysayers realize.In 2014, Strong received a five-year contract that started at $5 million in year 1; $100,000 increases annually and performance bonuses. Texas also covered the $4.3 million buyout from this contract with his prior team, Louisville.If Strong is fired now, there is a minimal return on that investment. No one forced Texas to have a five-year level of faith in his ability to build a winner. If they didn’t believe in him they should not have invested so much for so long a period.Like stock buys, you only sell during a bad cycle if you have no faith that the market performance will improve. As already stated, there is enough evidence that the performance in the market of college football will improve. If they believe he is truly a good coach, then they should believe in staying the course.If they cut bait now, Texas has locked in its losses, with no upside for the millions already invested in Strong.Once the hot emotions of these losses subsides, cold clear-headed economics will likely tell Texas to trust the instincts that led them to give Strong five years to build the program. It would be good for college football to see Texas assess the reality of rebuilding, and have the required patience to ignore the call for instant success. I suspect the horns will grow from short to long if they do.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/487064768/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:54:19.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
