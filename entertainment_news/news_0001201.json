She has joined her owner, Paul Ellis Graham, on just about every CROP walk, and she’s proven to be a good leader. Last year there were 60 walkers, who raised about $8,000, said Fred Schuepfer, the walk’s coordinator from its beginning. “Gracie has been on the walk for many years,” said Schuepfer. “Naming her Grand Marshal seems long overdue for all the promoting she has done on behalf of the hungry, locally and in places around the world.” Twenty-five percent of the funds collected stay in the area and will benefit food pantries in Monroe, Woodbury, Chester and Washingtonville. The rest of the money will be pooled with community Hunger Walks in some 2,000 cities and towns nationwide, and be earmarked for communities around the world where people are starving. To help, call Schuepfer at 782-8386. Coming up - A lecture on the waters of Kilimanjaro will be given at 7 p.m Tuesday in Kaplan Hall at SUNY Orange in Newburgh.
