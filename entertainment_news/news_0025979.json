Pic/Santa Banta \nAlia, 22, has her kitty full with movies like \"Kapoor and Sons\", \"Udta Punjab\" and \"Shuddhi\" and it is being said that she is giving hard competition to contemporaries like Parineeti Chopra and Shraddha Kapoor behind.\n\"I am not taking away anybody else's work. I am very happy to be working with so many talented directors and writers, who are penning scripts that are interesting for me.\n\"I think each character that I have played and I am playing in coming films are different from each other. So, I am genuinely feeling very fortunate as that is something I always wanted to do,\" she said while promoting \"Shaandaar\" here.\nThe actress is happy in her own space and is glad she does not have to run after filmmakers to sign her.\n\"I also believe that directors come to me if they think I suit the part, I am not running to people saying, 'This film is mine, give it to me.' I never say, 'I wish I was in that film' because every actor is suitable for a particular film.\"\nThe \"Highway\" star said though there have not been many changes in her personality since she entered showbiz but now the focus of her life is just films.\n\"I would like to believe I have not changed fully but definitely my life is now completely about work. Now all I can see is movies, movies and movies... I think that's a mirror image of my personality,\"\nshe said.\nAs for her next film, 'Shaandaar', which will see her for the first time romancing Shahid Kapoor, Alia said it was an exciting experience to collaborate with the \"Haider\" star.\n\"It was very exciting to work with Shahid, Pankaj sir, Vikas and Sanah.\n\"Shahid's real family is my family in the movie so I have taken away his family. 'Shaandaar' is a fun, fairytale film because it has a very dreamy vibe. It has a lot of quirk also,\" the actress said.\n'Shaandaar', directed by Vikas Bahl, will hit theatres on October 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:15.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
