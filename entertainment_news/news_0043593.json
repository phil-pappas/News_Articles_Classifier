(Photo: Free Press archives) Buy Photo \nIt’s one of rock 'n' roll's great love stories: the coming together of New York poet-musician Patti Smith and Detroit guitarist Fred (Sonic) Smith. \nHaving met at Detroit’s Lafayette Coney Island in spring 1976, the two embarked on an intense romance that led to married life spent largely off the public radar in St. Clair Shores before Fred Smith’s 1994 death. \nThe late MC5 guitarist is a recurring figure in Patti Smith’s new memoir “M Train,” which follows 2010’s much-acclaimed “Just Kids.” \nSmith has rarely divulged many personal details about her time in Michigan, which wrapped up in the late '90s with a move back to New York, where she’d been a leading figure on the punk scene two decades earlier. The gorgeously written book — sprinkled with richly detailed memories of Fred Smith and often dreamlike in structure — is likely to prove revelatory even to longtime fans. \n\"Michigan. Those were mystical times,” she writes. “An era of small pleasures.” \nIn an interview last week with Democracy Now, Smith said “M Train” had not been intended to focus so much on her late husband — he’s the planned subject of her next memoir — but that “he just kept entering. I mean, I never wrote so much about Fred since he’s passed away.” \nSmith embarked last week on a five-week book tour, which will lead her to Ann Arbor’s Michigan Theater for a live reading Monday night. \nHere are some glimpses into their life together, as conveyed in \"M Train\": \nThey lived in the Book Cadillac before getting married in 1980: \"We lived around the clock, moving through the days and nights with little regard for time,\" Smith writes, recalling a time of late nights and long drives to random Michigan towns, or visits to an Art Van Furniture store to take advantage of free coffee and doughnuts. \nThe two also spent time at the now-defunct Arcade Bar in downtown Detroit, Fred drinking beer and Patti her go-to black coffee. \nNeither liked the water, but they kept a '50s-vintage yacht in their St. Clair Shores yard: Patti and Fred spent summer nights on their parked boat, listening to Detroit Tigers games on a shortwave radio. Fred was a baseball devotee and once-promising shortstop who'd been scouted for the Tigers' farm system. \n\"He had a great arm but chose to use it as a guitarist,\" Patti Smith writes, \"yet his love of the sport never diminished.\" \nThe boat was eventually crushed by a lightning-struck weeping willow — then the oldest such tree in St. Clair Shores, Smith says. \nAn exotic first-anniversary trip wound up with a military interrogation: Venturing to the South American region of French Guiana in 1981, the young couple were separated and individually interrogated at a military checkpoint when their hired driver turned out to have a stowaway in his trunk. \nFred \"had trouble with the law as a young man and had always been wary of authority,\" Smith recalls. \"He betrayed no emotion and I followed his lead.\" \nFred Smith was a big-time aviation buff: Fred was \"fixated on every aspect of aviation,\" devouring books on the topic. In 1981, the couple trekked to North Carolina's Kill Devil Hills, scene of the Wright Brothers' inaugural flight, \"to salute America's first airfield,\" before driving down the southern coast to visit flight schools. Fred then took flying lessons in St. Augustine, Fla. \n\"Fred finally achieved his pilot's license but couldn't afford to fly a plane,\" she says of that early-'80s period. \"I wrote incessantly but published nothing. Through it all we held fast to the concept of the clock with no hands.\" \nThey brainstormed a prospective local cable show: Fred would host a segment called “Drunk in the Afternoon,” sitting with his guest of the day for a chat that would go “as far as their mutual intoxication would take them.” Patti would pop in for the periodic “Coffee Break,” encouraging viewers to have their own cup of coffee while she discussed prison literature. It never came to be. \n\"Not all dreams need to be realized,\" Patti Smith writes. \"That was what Fred used to say.\" \nPatti Smith 'M Train' reading \n7 p.m. Monday \nMichigan Theater, 603 E.
