(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)\\n \nLONDON (AP) -- Is \"Spectre\" Daniel Craig's Bond swansong? \nWe'll have to wait and see. \nThe British actor makes his fourth appearance as suave secret agent 007 in the Sam Mendes-directed film, which has its world premiere in London on Monday. \nSpeculation has swirled that it will be Craig's last film as James Bond ever since the actor told Time Out magazine that he would only make another Bond movie \"for the money.\" \nBut Craig said Thursday that \"I love making these films.\" \nAsked by Britain's Press Association about returning to Bond, Craig joked: \"Do I have a choice?\" \nBond battles a shadowy international conspiracy in \"Spectre,\" which stars Oscar winner Christoph Waltz as 007's nemesis. The film opens in the U.S. on Nov 6. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
