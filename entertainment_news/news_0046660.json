Look at us. Look at how differently we're treated.\" And then asking: \"Is this fair?\" \nYou can see an early part of that struggle in \"Freeheld,\" the story of a fight in Ocean County a decade ago. Laurel Hester was a veteran cop, with a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. She wanted to know that her partner would be taken care of. \nShe asked that the woman receive her pension benefits after she died. The board of freeholders said no. She's not your husband. You're not married. You're not family. \nAnd the question that Hester and her lover, and more and more of their supporters began to ask was: Is this fair? \nIt's a stirring story, and already the focus of a documentary (also called \"Freeheld,\" and the winner of a short-subject Oscar back in 2007). This is the docudrama version, with Julianne Moore and Ellen Page playing Hester and her partner Stacie Andree. Michael Shannon is Hester's partner on the force and Steve Carell shows up as a gay activist. \nIt's very well-acted by Moore and Shannon, and often emotional, but while it works, it's never quite as lively as it needs to be (or outrageous as it thinks it is.) As a work of art, it's a little small and hemmed in; unlike Hester, it plays it safe. \nMoore, of course is wonderful, simultaneously strong and fragile, and always alert. (There's a good scene early on where her second-class status in a sexist police department is instantly, wordlessly conveyed just through her superior's body language, and her alert recognition of same). And Shannon has, for a change, a great heroic role as her loyal colleague. Both of them carry the film. \nBut Page (who also produced) doesn't quite convince as Stacie, a tough grease monkey with a fondness for Harleys; she's good but a little too soft, a little too hesitant. And Carell seems to confuse volume with flamboyance; his I'm-here-and-I'm-queer agitator is never as fierce and funny as he's supposed to be. \nThat's probably due to director Peter Sollett (who hasn't directed a feature since the far livelier \"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\" in 2008, and came to the project after the edgier Catherine Hardwicke dropped out). Everything feels tentative, and there's little sense of place (thanks to the vanished New Jersey production credit, the movie was filmed in Westchester instead of down the shore). \nIn spite of itself, though, \"Freeheld\" still delivers emotionally. Even after watching her go through another decline as recently as last year's \"Still Alice,\" it's heartrending to watch Moore fight and flail and suffer. And even when some things don't convince, one question and answer remain clear. \nWas this fair? No. No, it was not. \nRatings note: The film contains strong language and sexual situations. 'Freeheld' (PG-13) Lionsgate (103 min.) Directed by Peter Sollett. With Julianne Moore, Ellen Page, Michael Shannon.
