The story goes that Inarritu spent millions traversing the globe, trying to find snow, and that the shoot was described by crew-members as a living hell.\nDiCaprio's recent comments pretty much echo this. \"I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do,\" DiCaprio said in a recent interview. \"Whether it’s going in and out of frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, or what I ate on set.\"\nYeah.\nFor his part, DiCaprio's made it clear that he doesn't regret signing on. \"The truth is that I knew what I was getting into... This was a film that had been floating around for quite some time, but nobody was crazy enough to really take this on,\" explained DiCaprio.\nThe film, which sees him play a fur-trapper left for dead in the wilderness by Tom Hardy, is being heavily mooted for Oscar glory and will finally net DiCaprio the Best Actor gong he's been denied so many times.\nVia VF.com\nMORE: Leonardo DiCaprio to reunite with Martin Scorsese for new true life horror story\nMORE: Pics: Brand new images of The Force Awakens show an evil-looking Domhnall Gleeson\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/10/leonardo-dicaprio-the-revenant?mbid=social_twitter"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:39:35.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
