According to reports, Salman ‘wants the Hollywood actor to do a role’, which has prompted Yash Raj Studio bosses to get Sly on board. It further states that Sylvester will only sign the film if he is sure ‘that his role in the film makes sense’ and does not reduce him to a ‘decorative prop’. The actor previously made a cameo in Sajid Nadiadwala’s ‘Kambakkht Ishq’ where he saves Kareena Kapoor from a bunch of goons in an alley way. Salman who will be playing an Indian wrestler in this flick, wants the ‘Rocky’ star to play his coach in the sports themed film. According to the report, the Sly will play the role of a veteran wrestler who helps bring Salman’s character Sultan back into the ring after a brief pause. If the deal comes through, Sylvester will be the second Hollywood star to sign on an Indian movie this month. Sly’s ‘The Expendables’ co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger recently signed on ‘Robot 2’ where he will star opposite South superstar Rajinikanth. Salman took to his Twitter handle last month to promote Stallone’s upcoming boxing flick ‘Creed’.

He even suggested the Bollywood star’s name for his ‘Expendables’ franchise in a series of tweets. However, those tweets came after Salu urged his fans on Twitter to follow Stallone, whom he considered a hero and a role model.\n@TheSlyStallone Isse beheter body, director, writer, insaan koi nahi hai.
