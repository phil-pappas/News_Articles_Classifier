She is bright, assertive, independent, and self-confident. Very articulate for her young age, Daniyah can hold her own in conversations with adults and her peers. Energetic and athletic, she loves to play baseball, basketball, and soccer. Daniyah also enjoys riding her bike, dancing, and listening to music. Birthdays and Christmas are her favorite holidays, because that's when families come together and celebrate. \nDaniyah has many plans for the future, including a career as a police officer. She also would like to be a member of a recreational basketball team to further her skills in the sport and to have a pet to care for. In the meantime, she is enjoying fourth grade, where her favorite subjects are art and math. \nIf Daniyah had three wishes, they would be to have a lot of toys to play with, to have a long life, and to have a forever family that would love her unconditionally and keep her safe. She would thrive in a patient, loving, and nurturing family that would provide a structured environment for her. She would do best in a home with children who are the same age or older. \nDaniyah and other children are available for adoption.
