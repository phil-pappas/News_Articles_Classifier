And sometimes if you’re in contemporary you might be able to show more of a dramatic side to it. And it’s really fun and hanging out with your friends is really fun.\"\nBut knowing some girls she dances with can’t afford the lessons and clothes that her parents can, she and her parents came up with an idea to make dancing a bit more affordable: to collect lightly used dance apparel that’s sitting in the closet and distribute those items to girls who need it. \nDancing isn’t cheap: Growing girls quickly cycle through leotards, tights and special shoes for different dances, and that’s on top of the hundreds of dollars it costs for class each month and hundreds more for competitions. It all adds up very quickly – especially for some of the parents at the Dance World Academy in Passaic.\n\"The area that we’re in … we have students who come from all economic backgrounds,\" said Donna Farinella, who has owned and run Dance World in Passaic for 38 years. She noted that some students can’t dance as often as they would like because of the cost of lessons.\n\"For every form of dance, you have a different shoe and each one of those shoes can be $50 to $100,\" Farinella said. \"And think how fast little children grow.\"\nIsabella and her parents are calling the project Dancer’s Closet. An inventory — available on Isabella’s Facebook page, \"USA National Miss New Jersey Pre-Teen Isabella Galan\" — calls for leotards, tights, shorts, tank tops, ballet shoes, jazz shoes, pointed shoes and tap shoes. \nThe Galans devised the project as they were thinking of a charity, as required for USA National Miss New Jersey queens. Isabella placed first among pre-teens at the pageant, which took place in late August at Woodbridge High School.\nIsabella wanted her charity to align with her passion — she spends up to four hours at the dance studio on weekdays.\nWhen she’s not dancing, she goes to musicals with her grandmother or watches pageant and dance videos on YouTube. \nThe idea is simple enough. Donors drop off the apparel in boxes in six locations: Dance World’s Passaic and Clifton locations, D3 Dancenter in Clifton, Stagelite Centre in Pequannock, Le Danse in Wayne and Dance Arts Academy in Boonton. \"You donate it and we clean them, we sort them by size,\" Isabella said. \nWhen a recipient reaches out to the Galans at dancerscloset@outlook.com, Maria Galan, Isabella’s mother, a former Passaic police sergeant, will arrange a place and time to pick up the clothes.\n\"Especially kids this age, they grow up so fast and some of her friends, they go through three of the same tap shoes in a year because their feet are growing so fast,\" said Isabella’s father, Tom Galan, a physical education teacher at Passaic High School. \nAll dancers, whatever their background, have the same desire to excel on stage, he said. \"Everyone should have that opportunity.\"\nEmail: parkm@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:22:16.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
