She called out for eye-drops, however when her friend mistakenly handed her superglue, she immediately knew what went wrong.\n\"As soon as I felt it in my eye I felt it burn and I closed my eye and screamed 'Call 911,'\" she told WPBF-TV.\nIn order to get the eye open, her doctor had to apply anaesthesia to the eyelids in order to pry the eye open. Gaydos will have to return at some point to get the glue removed from her eyes as well.\nBelieve it or not, mistaking eye-drop fluid and superglue is suprisingly common. Dr. Pankaj Gupta, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, said that he's seen multiple cases - but that people shouldn't worry. \"The first thing I think everyone needs to know is donâ€™t panic,\" explained Dr. Gupta.\n\"There is not a single thing that is permanent that will not slough off on its own,\" Gupta explained. \"In time it will go away.\"\nBut not the embarrassment. That never goes away.\nVia ABCNews\nMORE: UFO theorists think they've seen a woman on Mars\nMORE: Watch: Oh nothing, just a giant bear out for a stroll through the neighbourhood\nMORE: Pic: Rock formation on the Moon looks like a human face", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=34337327", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/woman-mistakes-super-glue-eye-drops-ends-stuck/story?id=34344088"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:00:02.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
