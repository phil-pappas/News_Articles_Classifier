Mark Ronson (Jonathan Short/Invision) \nHe said: “Becoming a patron of the Amy Winehouse Foundation is a big deal to me. It’s very important to help the great work that they are already doing, both with substance misuse and helping talented disadvantaged youth through music. \n“Amy’s music touched so many and also helped them – and now through the Foundation, it continues to help people.” \nHip-hop star Nas and producer Salaam Remi, who were friends with Amy, will also become patrons of the charity, while Ella Henderson, Jess Glynne, Foxes, The Voice 2014 winner Jermaine Jackman and Vanessa Feltz will be named ambassadors for the Amy Winehouse Foundation. We're delighted that @MarkRonson , @Nas and @SaLaAMReMi will be comfirmed as Patron's of the Amy Winehouse Foundation tomorrow night #AWFGala", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:52:35.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
