Garrison Keillor, host of NPR's popular variety show \"A Prairie Home Companion,\" plans to retire. Except this time, the 73-year-old Keillor says he means it, and has already said that Chris Thile, mandolin player for Nickel Creek and the Punch Brothers, will take over as host next fall. \nBut before Keillor steps aside to live out his days at Lake Wobegon, he'll make one last Milwaukee appearance with \"Companion,\" with a live taping at the Milwaukee Theatre March 5. \nTickets are $35 to $65, available beginning at 10 a.m. Nov. 6 at the box office (500 W. Kilbourn Ave.), by calling (800) 745-3000, or visiting ticketmaster.com . Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
