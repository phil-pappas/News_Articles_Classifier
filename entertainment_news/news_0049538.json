It's a protein-lover's delight, with healthy fats and whole grains rounding out the ingredients. (Curious and hungry for the recipe? You can find it here ). \nThe next round of voting has begun, and will cut the 16 remaining contestants down to eight. To vote, visit the Hometown Breakfast Battle website, then create a user name and password or sign in through social media. Voting in this round concludes Oct. 5.
