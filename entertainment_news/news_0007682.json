A filmmaker's quest to ID men behind Lockerbie bombing Ken Dornstein speaks during an interview on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015, in Boston. A long investigation by Dornstein, a documentary filmmaker whose brother died in the attack, identified Libyan Abu Agila Mas'ud as the possible maker of the bomb that shattered the New York-bound Boeing 747 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988. Mas'ud has not been named by U.S. or Scottish officials as a suspect. All 259 people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground were killed. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) Most Read \nNeed a Profile?
