The \" American Idol \" alum teamed up with the British comedian to recreate the legendary band's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" music video during his appearance on the show. Two Lamberts and two Carrs hilariously appeared against a black backround and sang the Queen classic together as the iconic quartet. The singer looked like he had a lot of fun while the show's host looked ridiculous in a wig. Lambert and Carr reworked the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the song, which the former sang when he auditioned for \"American Idol\". Lambert was on \"Chatty Man\" to promote his new single \"Another Lonely Night\". He also had a chat with Carr and at one point addressed rumors claiming that Queen would be playing Glastonbury next year. \"I don't know! That's the first time hearing of it, so I don't know. If they invited me, yes, of course I would [play],\" said the 33-year-old star, who frequently fills in for Queen's late frontman Freddie Mercury at live shows. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:15.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
