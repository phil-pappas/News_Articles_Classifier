Directed by Kent Gash.\nWith Tamberla Perry, Samantha Soule, Becky Ann Baker and Kim Wayans.\nSchedule: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday through Friday; 1:30 and 7:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\nTickets: $50. 212-967-7555 or pub lictheater.org.\nThe first clue that something is up comes when they don't give you a Playbill as you're shown to your seat, the usher explaining that programs won't be distributed until intermission so as not to spoil the play's surprise.\nThat should have been \"first surprise,\" because \"Barbecue\" is chock-full of surprises. You could even say that Robert O'Hara's play, which opened Thursday night at the Public Theater, is mainly about its surprises.\nNot to burden you with my problems, but that makes it hard to write a review not made up of coy hints. I can be straightforward to a certain point, though, without spoiling anything:\nThe play, directed by Kent Gash, begins in a pleasant, leafy park, where a man and his three sisters have gathered for a barbecue, which they plan to be the occasion for an intervention with – maybe \"against\" is more appropriate — a later-arriving fourth sister, Barbara.\nShe's a crack addict and alcoholic, as well as an all-around hellion known to her intimates as Zippity Boom. The plan is to send her to a rehab clinic in faraway Alaska.\nThat two of the three other sisters, one of whom swigs from a giant-sized bottle of Jack Daniel's, are also drug addicts and alcoholics doesn't seem a big issue in this family, which appears to have emerged from a particularly benighted trailer park.\nThe characters – the women call each other \"heifer\" — are funny in their trashy dress, language and behavior. But the script is uneven — some jokes are hilarious, others don't land, and there are, subsequently, jarringly serious moments about the toll taken by addiction.\nAll of this, though, is just a set-up, an entry point for a story that will swerve off in a series of unexpected directions, with different tones, as it touches on race, celebrity, the relationship of reality and illusion and the eternal lure of wealth.\nO'Hara, whose previous play, \"Bootycandy,\" examined the life of a gay black man in a series of sketches that ranged from hysterical to serious to outrageous, has thrown a lot of ingredients into a big pot in \"Barbecue,\" and they don't blend perfectly.\nBut messy as the narrative sometimes becomes, there's something exhilarating about the enthusiasm, and bright humor, with which he explores the possibilities of theater. His play might be flawed, but it's also very entertaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:12:02.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
