Main St. Photographs by Montgomery and watercolors by Dedman will highlight the gallery through the end of October. Both artists have had interest in their medium since childhood. Montgomery was given her first camera at age 12 and still has her first negatives. Dedman’s first “hanging” was a picture of her dog displayed in the hallway of her grade school. Although Montgomery is largely self-taught, she has attended seminars and classes as well as learning a great deal from her contacts with fellow photo enthusiasts. She has gained experience through many years working in camera departments, as secretary for the Blue Mountain Photo Club and Columbia Council, as well as being a 4-H photography leader and over 10 years as photography superintendent for the Southeastern Washington Fair. She has received awards locally, regionally and internationally. She takes great joy in seeing an image she has made create interest and brighten someone’s day. Her talent and sense of humor are very evident in her unique view of the world through the lens of the camera. Dedman worked on her own trying different media before deciding to focus on watercolor. She attended classes, studying under several well-known watercolorists, for over 10 years in Cocoa, Fla. During that time she was an active member of the local Watercolor Society and exhibited widely in that area. More recently she has studied various other media, such as acrylic, colored pencil, pastels, pen-and-ink collage and mixed media. Since moving to Dayton in 2006 she has had the joy of teaching watercolor classes out of her own studio. She belongs to the Allied Arts Association in Richland, ArtWalla in Walla Walla and is a founding member of the Blue Mountain Artist’s Guild of Dayton.
