Shower or two. Entertainment Comedian Arj Barker wants public to Get In My Head by: Arj Barker is headed to Far North Queensland. Source: Supplied \nARJ Barker hasn’t even finished touring his latest show but he is already looking ahead. \n“I’m already writing new jokes for my next show,” the comedian tells The Cairns Post . \nBarker says he is always thinking about what his next show will be. \nThe comedian brings his current show Get In My Head to Cairn Civic Centre this month. \nIf the comedian is to be believed, it is among his best. \n“My material is universal, so I try to make it about humans, not about one particular group of people,” he says. \n“I try to find what commonalities we all have.” \nOne thing you probably won’t see him doing is making fun of a particular group or person. It’s just not something that interests him. Making fun of everyone together? That’s fair game and so is he. \n“If you leave my show thinking that I’m a big idiot, then I feel like I’ve done my job.” \nThe comedian admits he can’t always predict whether a joke will land and says there have been jokes that for years he didn’t try. \n“And then I just threw them out without, you know, a thought.” \nHe recalls a night with a flat audience where he told a joke – let’s just say involving pee and poo – and nailed it. \n“It just lit them up ... I’d hit on something there.” \nIt goes the other way too, Barker says. \n“I don’t always know … sometimes I think something’s really hilarious and then it doesn’t do very well.” \nIf Barker is being truthful about his failures, it’s tough to believe they would happen that often. \nThe comedian is a popular guy. He has performed in Cairns an impressive number of times, appeared on cult TV show Flight of the Conchords and boasts nearly 75,000 Facebook followers. \nThe Californian-born comic first visited Australia with his comedy in the late ’90s, doing gigs in Sydney over the course of several weeks. \nAs he describes it: “I just had a blast and I couldn’t wait to come back and that was really the reason why I kept coming back initially.” \nBarker wasn’t making a lot of money but he says he built up a fanbase and went on to perform at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. \n“One day I turned around and said: ‘S …, you know, there’s 500 people here to see me tonight’. \n“Up ’til that moment I hadn’t really realised that I was making progress here (in Australia).” \nNow he’s busily branching out further – with music and television. \n“I’m trying to make some songs. I think they’re funny, but I’m not putting a lot of pressure on myself,” he says. \nBarker is also writing a show with a friend centred around himself in the vein of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Louie . \n“There’s definitely a twist that makes ours different, ’cause you don’t just wanna say: ‘I’m gonna do what you do’.” \nBarker doesn’t reveal just what the twist is. If only getting into the comedian’s head was actually a possibility. \nCHECK Arj Barker’s Get In My Head is at the Cairns Civic Theatre on October 23 and 24.
