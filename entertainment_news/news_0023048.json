Hannah and MzK!m Product!on’s Kimberly Zulkowski have teamed up for the new feature film “Grandma’s House,” as their debut project kicking off the first of several feature films in the works. Produced and directed by Paul D. Hannah and storyline built upon Executive Producer Zulkowski’s real-life experiences, this dynamic duo is sure to captivate audiences across big screens nationwide. Filming is set to begin Oct. 18, 2015, in Los Angeles, CA, with the theatrical release expected for spring of 2016. Based upon the true story of Zulkowski’s grandmother, Margie Ree Harris. “Grandma’s House” gives a compelling insight into how the Executive Producer’s life changed when she moved into her grandmother's home and their generations became one, under the same roof. Chock-full of passion, faith, and family, the film demonstrates the trials and tribulations she faced living with a grandparent who stood as an inner-city matriarch and pillar of strength to selflessly serve her family and surrounding community. “Margie was a Godly woman who left her mark on everyone she came in contact with; she was an amazing example of strength courage and love. I hope by telling my grandmother's story, will take audiences back down memory lane with their grandmothers. Or to that older person who was loving, 'old fashioned,' and it wasn't until after their death they realized how wise and valuable they truly were,” said Zulkowski.\nA veteran of the film industry, Writer/Producer/Director Paul D. Hannah is responsible for works such as “My Favorite Five,” “The Sin Seer,” “The Marriage Chronicles,” and “Who Can I Run To.”\n“I was drawn to tell this story because of my grandmother and how she left her imprint on my life and my destiny. I believe it will touch a lot of people and play tribute to grandmothers everywhere. This film is life-changing,” stated Hannah. The busy filmmaker is also gearing up for his first Christmas film slated for release December 2016.\nFirst time Executive Producer and Milwaukee multi-business owner, Zulkowski has been waiting her whole life to share this story. “Grandma’s House” will feature original music from Paul D. Hannah, songs written by Zulkowski’s grandmother, and Zulkowski herself. Representing the celebration of life this film is an homage to Margie.\nThe film has an all-star ensemble cast including Loretta Devine, Wendy Raquel Robinson, Alex Thomas, Jazsmin Lewis, Coco Jones, Stephen Bishop, Jordan Calloway, and many more.\nFor more information, please visit Overflow Entertainment and MzK!m Product!ons .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL292ZXJmbG93LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQuY29t", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL016a2ltcHJvZHVjdGlvbnMuY29t"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:15:04.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
