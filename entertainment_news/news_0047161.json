Drobbits' user interface is fully customizable, and therefore anyone from small children to advanced web developers will find the platform easy to use.\n\"The game industry is growing year by year. And given the recent success of games like Clash of Clans and Angry Birds, entrepreneurs and developers are all over creating games to make money,\" said Brad Listermann, CEO and founder of App Farm. \"We wanted to bring the game business to everyone. Now, stay-at-home moms and 13-year-old kids alike will be able to turn their game ideas into reality and have the opportunity to capitalize on it.\"\nApp Farm is a subsidiary of WorldFlix ( OTC PINK: WRFX ), an entertainment management firm based in Palm Springs, Calif.
