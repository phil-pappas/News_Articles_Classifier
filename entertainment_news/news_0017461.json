Related Items \nBALLINA Players has started rehearsals for Legally Blonde Jr, their first production for 2016. \nAfter the casting process ended, we spoke to director Mike Sheehan about this upcoming production. \nWhy did you choose Legally Blond? \nWe thought it would be popular with kids auditioning, as well as younger audiences, because it is more modern, it has catchy music, and there are many parts which means more kids get a chance to have lines and not just be in chorus. \nThis is important for young people because they all want to contribute and have something for their parents to see them do. \nHow hard was it to find the cast? \nWe had about 33 auditions for the show and some did not wish to be involved if they missed the part they auditioned for. \nThis is about average for youth productions. \nI knew that we would find talented kids to come and audition; only about 10 have done these productions previously. \nWhat do you expect the show to be like? \nJordan (Stotter, musical director), Jaime (Sheehan, director and choreographer) and I agree that it will be a lot of fun for the cast, and very entertaining for the patrons. \nIt is up-tempo music and a nice neat story. \nWhen can audiences start buying tickets for this production? \nTickets will be available just before Christmas at ballinaplayers.com.au , or at Just Funkin' music shop in River St, Ballina. ballina players", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:15:41.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
