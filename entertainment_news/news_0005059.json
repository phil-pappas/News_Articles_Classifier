Victoria Beckham is looking stunningly androgynous on the front cover of the November issue of German Vogue. \nThe star appears to be excited about her second cover appearance, as she has been splashing the images all over her Instagram. \nIn one shot, the 41-year-old is shown in a tailored shirt with trousers and braces, with her usually-immaculate hair in wisps around her face. \nIn a more wintry image, she is pictured in a coat and a wide-brimmed hat – rocking the monochrome look. \nShot in London by Irish photographer Boo George, the former Spice Girl opened up about what drives her in her career as a fashion designer. \nAccording to the Daily Mail, she said: “I just started doing what I’d always hoped to do. Fashion has been my passion since forever. I didn’t do it to prove anything to anyone besides myself.” \n“I simply wanted to create the perfect dress,” she explained. “Something that was easy to wear, that you didn’t have to think about for long. You can depend on my dress, you get into it, pull the zipper up, and you’re ready to go out.” \nShe added: “My customers like that. What I do is real, organic, true to who I am.” Share article \nThe quote on the cover translates to Victoria’s top piece of advice: “It is good to dream large scale.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:46:11.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
