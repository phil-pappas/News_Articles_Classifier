Chikka finishes tied 10th at TPC golf meet By Indo-Asian News Service on October 11, 2015 at 4:22 PM Comments Taipei, Oct 11: Indian golfer S. Chikka could only manage an even-par 72 to finish tied 10th, while compatriot Gaganjeet Bhullar dropped 14 places to be joint 22nd following a three-over 75 in the third and final round of the $500,000 Yeangder Tournament Players Championship here on Sunday. (Read: Pele in Kolkata after 38 years, receives thunderous welcome) \nChikka, who shared the eighth spot with Bhullar on Saturday, was inconsistent throughout the day. The 22-year-old got birdies on the fourth, 11th and 15th holes against bogeys on the third, sixth and 14th for a 72 that gave him a total of six-under 210 (73-65-72) — six strokes behind champion Shaun Norris of South Africa (68-68-68). \nAsian Tour rookie Norris overcame swirling winds by shooting five birdies in his opening seven holes to defeat overnight leader Miguel Tabuena of the Philippines by two shots with a winning total of 12-under 204. Tabuena was disappointed not to erase last year’s play-off defeat as he settled for second place after struggling to a 73 at the Linkou International Golf and Country Club. \nGiwhan Kim of Korea, Hsu Hao-sheng of Chinese Taipei, Keith Horne of South Africa and Thai duo Panuphol Pittayarat and Natipong Srithong, who turned professional two months ago, tied for third place on matching 208s in the weather shortened event. \nNorris, 33, overcame a three-shot deficit with a flying start despite the rainy and blustery conditions. He grabbed the lead for the first time this week after seven holes and cruised to victory despite dropping a shot on the 18th hole.Among other Indians in the fray, Bhullar was tied 22nd on 213, while Himmat Rai (71) shared the 34th spot with seven others on 215. Rahil Gangjee was undone by a seven-over 79 as he took his total to 222 and finished tied 69th. \n  4:22 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:59:00.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
