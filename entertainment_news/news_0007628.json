(March 20 - April 19): All new arrangements take getting used to but considering how well you're fitting in, this current transition looks like it will be relatively painless.\nTAURUS. (April 20 - May 20): Raise your hand if you feel like you're out of your depth. You're only voicing the question that's on everyone else's minds.\nGEMINI. (May 21 - June 20): Can a deal come together as easily as all that? It will if you make yourself unavailable. Don't take any calls, emails, or texts and it's in the bag.\nCANCER. (June 21 - July 21): Expect to switch emotional gears. A conversation that starts out casual quickly becomes confessional when Mercury trines the Moon in Aquarius.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 22): A question answered by a question is a sure-fire sign that something's amiss. Even if it feels awkward, keep pressing for a concrete answer.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You're ready to restructure finances after much delay. Don't be shocked if it goes off easier than expected. Next time don't be so slow to get your money house in order.\nLIBRA. (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Airy trines give you the light-handed touch. This is the perfect day for networking, negotiating, or driving a hard bargain.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): A complicated property matter is resolved with a minimum of effort. Proof again that you have an innate sense of timing.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20): Getting the impression that everyone's trying to avoid a certain topic? Instead of inquiring, you might consider following their lead for now.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19): On the job changes go better than expected. The end result is a healthy balance between work and pay.\nAQUARIUS. (Jan. 20 - Feb. 17): A second glance at a memo or note reveals something you missed the first time. The news is even better than you thought!\nPISCES. (Feb. 18 - March 19): Acquaintances can open doors, but you have to ask first. You can't expect people to read your mind and do you a favor.
