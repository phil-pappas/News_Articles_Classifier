The most disputed section of the document concerned whether remarried Catholics can receive Communion.\nWhile the document doesn't chart any specific path to receiving the sacraments as originally sought by liberal prelates, it opens the door to case-by-case exceptions by citing the role of discernment and individual conscience in spiritual direction.\n News Nation/World Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-25T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:15:26.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
