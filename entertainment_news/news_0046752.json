Photo: Gary LaPersonne \n1. THE APARTMENT (125 minutes) PG \nNeatly balancing the sentimental and the sordid, Billy Wilder's 1960 satire argues that the corporate rat race is prostitution by other means. Shirley MacLaine is at her most winning, Jack Lemmon at his most manic and the script remains a model of construction that puts today's Hollywood screenwriters to shame. Digitally projected. Astor, tomorrow, 7pm. Double feature with One, Two, Three.\n2. GREENERY WILL BLOOM AGAIN (78 minutes) Unrated  \nTrying to get ahead: Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment . \nComposed mostly in shades of grey, Ermmano Olmiâ€‹'s sketchy but forceful vision of the First World War unfolds over the course of a single night in a mountain stronghold buried in snow. Olmi is now in his 80s, and this is recognisably a \"late work\", concerned less with one particular war than with the universal fact of approaching death. Screens as part of the Italian Film Festival. Palace Brighton Bay, tomorrow, 2.30pm and Palace Balwyn, tomorrow, 6.15pm.\nAdvertisement 3. MEAN GIRLS (97 minutes) M \nMark Waters' 2004 teen comedy is probably the last real classic of the genre, with Lindsay Lohan showing equal parts ditziness and pluck as an intrepid innocent who goes astray in the jungle of high school. The knowing script is by Tina Fey, who gives a sharp supporting performance as a well-meaning teacher. Special screening for International Mean Girls Day. Digitally projected. Cameo Belgrave, Elsternwick Classic and Hawthorn Lido, today, 7pm. \n4. A BUG'S LIFE (95 minutes) G \nVisually graceful and packed with sight gags, this 1998 fantasy-adventure shows what the team at Pixar Studios were capable of in their earlier, less pretentious phase. Even the plot is progressive by Pixar standards, with a technologically gifted ant (voiced by Dave Foley) teaming with a troupe of non-conforming \"circus bugs\" to free his colony from its grasshopper oppressors. Digitally projected. Astor, tomorrow, 2pm. Double feature with Toy Story .\n5. STRANGERLAND (112 minutes) MA \nA striking debut for director Kim Farrant, this arthouse thriller about children disappearing into the desert brings together many familiar themes of Australian cinema yet remains intriguing and unpredictable in its own right. Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes play the troubled parents of the missing brother and sister, with Hugo Weaving as a level-headed cop. Astor, today, 7.30pm. Double feature with Holding the Man .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:15:41.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
