Bradley Cooper is a chef trying to recapture his Michelin Star in 'Burnt' \nNot only was it a chance to come down from the physical intensity of American Sniper, but it took him back to his childhood while learning some useful new skills. \"When I was a kid I would screw up cooking with my grandmother,\" he laughs. \"It was an Italian family, so cooking was a huge part of it. Being around food is very soothing to me. My grandfather had a garlic business. So basically I'd been doing research since I was a kid!\" \nBefore making Burnt, Cooper didn't think of himself as much of a cook, so he consulted celebrity chefs to prepare for the role. \"I had access to Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing, Gordon Ramsay and Clare Smyth. These are all Michelin-starred chefs,\" he says. \"I actually learned how much I can't cook by doing this film. You sit through one session with Clare Smyth and you realise this is a level of execution that's world-class. To get three Michelin stars is literally almost impossible. The level of perfection, discipline and sacrifice is incredible.\" \nMore: Watch the 'Burnt' Teaser Trailer \nThese chefs inspired his portrayal of the film's character Adam Jones. \"I created a guy I see as a mixture of the three guys I studied: Marcus Wareing, Gordon Ramsey and Marco Pierre White,\" Cooper says. \"He's a combination. Little things he does, physical things, are basically things I stole from all three of those guys. It wasn't conscious, but going back and watching the movie I see it.\" \nUp next, Cooper will reteam with Jennifer Lawrence for a fourth time in the biopic Joy, after Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and Serena. But he says that their romantic chemistry is on-screen only. \"It just didn't happen,\" he told radio host Howard Stern when asked about a backstage romance. \"It's not the way we are together.\" \nListen to clips from the interview below: Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:35:59.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
