Only 10 per cent of the pollution in urban areas is due to industrial waste, Fadnavis said adding that 90 per cent pollution can be eradicated if citizens and administration work closely to resolve the issue. ”As part of the Swachh Maharashtra Abiyan, we will soon introduce a policy where sewage water will be treated where bulk users like Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and power generation units can utilise it,” the Chief Minister said.

Fadnavis said the policy will be unveiled in the third phase after the Open Defecation Free campaign and the solid waste management programme. ”Waste is wealth. Nothing is waste,” he said and assured adequate funds to the towns and cities participating in the Swachh Maharashtra campaign from the 14th Finance Commission. Earlier, Fadnavis felicitated 19 towns including 5 from Satara district as well as wards A and B (Mohammed Ali Road and Chandanwadi) in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for being “Open Defecation Free”. He said the entire state would be covered by 2017. Meanwhile, Fadnavis also announced that Right to Services Act has been linked to the ‘Aple Sarkar’ portal bringing 46 services of seven departments like Revenue, Rural development, labour, water supply, forests, registration and stamps, printing and stationary, skilled development, online. ”Maharashtra has become the first state to offer services like birth and death certificate, domicile, marriage registration online,” he said. Fadnavis said there are 224 notified services under the Right to Services Act. Earlier, there was no legal recourse to citizens if services were not provided by government officials. ”Now the concerned officer is accountable and punishable under the law,” he said. Fadnavis said a mobile app of the Right to Services Act would soon be launched. Describing the Right to Services Act as a flagship scheme of his government, he said, bringing it online was a revolutionary step. \n 34 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:33:51.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
