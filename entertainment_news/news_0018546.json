He and his goalie coach, Maciej Szwoch, watched how other goalies played and the approach they took.\n\"I'm a big Pekka Rinne fan,\" Ullmark said, referring to the Nashville Predators star. \"We were trying to think about how I want to play, what are the the most important things to play at a high level.\"\nA native of Sweden, Ullmark knew his first exposure to the American Hockey League and National Hockey League would be challenging. He had never played a game on a North American-sized rink; not in the World Junior Championship, not with a touring Swedish national team.\nThe cerebral approach helped prepare him for what he would face.\nNow that he's here, he's still using his head. To make saves. Literally.\nUllmark is proving the header isn't just for the soccer pitch. He has intentionally used his mask at least seven times to make saves in his three starts with the Rochester Americans.\nIn Wednesday's 4-2 loss at Utica, at least four of the 47 shots faced by Ullmark hit his mask.\n\"If it works for Henrik Lundqvist (the Swedish-born New York Rangers goalie), why wouldn't it work for me?\" Ullmark said after practice Thursday, when the Amerks prepared for Friday's 7:05 p.m. home game against the Toronto Marlies. \"It's a really good tool.\"\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nAmerks prefer to be cautious with Ullmark for now\nThat's actually how he made his first save in North America. Utica Comets winger Alexandre Grenier unleashed a wrister from the right circle just 85 seconds into Ullmark's debut on Oct. 10. The goalie never moved his catching glove and he instead angled his head slightly and let the puck carom off his mask.\n\"With shots from angles, they want to go top shelf, short side,\" Ullmark said. \"It's hard to get your shoulder up that high so it's easier to just use the mask.\"\nThis wasn't necessarily part of his game when he played for MODO in the Swedish League the past two seasons. But his new Bauer mask — one with greatly improved padding of a memory-foam nature — made him realize his head can be as effective as his blocker.\n\"I took a shot to the head with my new mask in training camp and I couldn't feel a thing,\" he said.\nThe primary reason he has incorporated the header into his repertoire is to enable him to maintain full coverage of his net. Since tip-ins and deflections happen frequently, Ullmark is concerned that if he brings his catching glove up to snare a shot and then the shot is subsequently redirected, the puck could go into the space that the glove and his left arm previously had covered.\n\"Because of the risk of a deflection, he wants to stay big,\" Amerks goalie coach Bob Janosz said.\nSaid Ullmark: \"This way I still have coverage.\"\nHis play has really been remarkable considering this is his first experience on the smaller ice surfaces of North America. He said his summer preparation was beneficial.\n\"We have a thing, risk management,\" Ullmark said. \"You always have to be aware of the risk that can happen. You don't think about the safe play. You think about what could go wrong. Everything can turn real bad real fast.\"\nThat's why he says he doesn't assume that just because a puck-carrier has time and space, that the proper play will be made. His mindset: expect the unexpected.\nHe also wants to keep learning.\n\"He asks a lot of questions, he wants to know why things are done a certain way,\" Amerks coach Randy Cunneyworth said. \"He's inquisitive.\n\"And the thing I really notice is the level of desire to stop the puck, the level of no-quit. Just when you think the shot's going in, something comes across and gets in the way.\"\nLike his mask\nKEVINO@gannett.com\nHockey night\nThe matchup: Amerks vs. Toronto Marlies (affiliate of the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs).\nTime/place: 7:05 p.m. Friday/Blue Cross Arena at the Rochester Community War Memorial.\nTickets: $14, $23, $25, $27.\nRecords: The Amerks are 2-3. Toronto is 3-1.\nUpdate: Defenseman Bobby Sanguinetti cleared waivers and joined the Amerks Thursday afternoon. Since he hasn't practiced with the team, his playing status hadn't been determined on Thursday. Center Tim Schaller (upper body injury) is probable. He missed Wednesday's game. Veteran defenseman Frank Corrado has joined the Marlies on a conditioning assignment.\nRadio: WHTK-AM (1280).", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad96b59350ccfa1696e5f4564b1186d2e73ad04d/c=0-159-3825-3984/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Rochester/Rochester/635803484132521999-ullmark-pic.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:07:26.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
