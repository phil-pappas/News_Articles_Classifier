French-Canadian Tellier and his family were among the earliest settlers of the Walla Walla Valley, arriving in 1834. Tellier worked with the Hudson’s Bay Fur Company, prior to becoming a millwright for Dr. Marcus Whitman at his newly established mission. Tellier will speak of the unrest between local Indians and emigrants, and the subsequent Battle of Frenchtown, also known as the Battle of Walla Walla, which brought an end to Indian control of the Walla Walla Valley. The Frenchtown Historic Site, roughly located between College Place and Touchet, came into existence in 2010, established by the Frenchtown Historical Foundation. The interpretive park includes walking trails on some of the 27 acres of land where the fighting took place in 1855. Living History performances are held in the pioneer settlement at Fort Walla Walla Museum, 755 Myra Road. Visitors are encouraged to question the Living History re-enactors about their lives and times. Museum hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. through October, and 10 a.m.-4 p.m. November through February. Admission is free to members and children under 6; $3 for children ages 6-12; $7 for seniors 62 and older and students; and $8 general admission.
