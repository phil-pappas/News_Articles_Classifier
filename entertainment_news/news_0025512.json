Or in the case of Game 2 of the NLCS, rotten eggs.\nNearly all of the action Sunday night came within 60 minutes of \"60 Minutes.\"\nThat made for a boring game — excruciating, painful and boring for Cubs fans — and an understandably low-energy TBS telecast. Even the scene at Murphy's Bleachers after Kris Bryant's RBI double was ... meh.\nYou know you're getting a little desperate when you mention in the eighth inning, as Ernie Johnson did: \"(Kyle) Schwarber has struck out three times tonight. But with one swing he can bring the Cubs within a run.\"\nIt was a contrast to what transpired Saturday night, when both Game 1 and TBS' coverage delivered.\nAmong the Game 1 highlights came when Johnson and ace (pun intended) analyst Ron Darling recounted a quirky conversation with Cubs skipper Joe Maddon.\nDarling: \"We talked about expensive honey, dark chocolate, Twizzlers.\"\nJohnson: \"The more we talked, the more we had in common, especially on the Twizzler front.\"\nDarling: \"Manuka honey, from New Zealand.\"\nJohnson: \"Really good if you're a little under the weather.\"\nDarling made a strong point about the decision to send Starlin Castro, who got nailed by a Yoenis Cespedes throw: \"You're down near the bottom of the lineup, I don't think that's a bad play by third-base coach Gary Jones. You don't get that many opportunities off these great pitchers.\"\nAnd Darling joked of a Travis d'Arnaud blast that hit the giant red apple beyond center field: \"D'Arnaud makes like skee ball ... 50 points!\"\nJohnson summoned his inner Jim Nantz at the top of Sunday's telecast, calling the apple shot \"a home run that thrilled Mets fans to the core.\"\nJohnson pointed out that Mets starter Noah Syndergaard had thrown 1,421 pitches of at least 95 mph during the season. That does sound incredible. But without any comparisons, who knows?\nDarling said the Mets had learned crucial pitch patterns from Matt Harvey in Game 1 and would go heavy on breaking balls and changeups early in the count. Syndergaard promptly started Dexter Fowler with four straight fastballs.\nOverall, though, Darling pounds the zone with strikes, as he did long ago with the Mets.\nAfter Maddon instructed Jake Arrieta to walk Daniel Murphy, Darling said: \"I'm shaking my head. ... I'll tell you right now: Arrieta wasn't intentionally walking anyone in the second half of the season.\"\nAdded fellow analyst Cal Ripken: \"I don't think he wanted to there either.\"\nThe understated Ripken doesn't add a ton to the broadcasts, but he was in his wheelhouse analyzing a Curtis Granderson steal of second. Castro covered but could not apply the tag.\n\"That's a popular thing now with middle infielders,\" Ripken said. \"Get in front of the bag, let the ball travel and reach back. I would still prefer the straddle of the bag. Gives you a better athletic position maybe to lean back and buy yourself some time to pick that and then put the tag straight down.\"\nRipken had a clever, if predictable, line in the top of the ninth. Mentioning the Mets closer, he said: \"All I know is, we're getting very familiar with (Jeurys) Familia.\"\nJohnson immediately responded: \"Oh, you've been sitting on that one, Iron Man.\"\nJohnson is an excellent play-by-plan man. His descriptions are crisp and accurate and he takes advantage of every opportunity to lighten the mood. In short, someone you'd want to sit next to for a three-hour game.\nJust not this game, if you're a Cubs fan.\n\"The Mets take a 2-0 series lead,\" he said, \"by beating Jake Arrieta.\"\nA dagger to the heart.\ntgreenstein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TeddyGreenstein\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball New York Mets Chicago Cubs Jake Arrieta Starlin Castro Daniel Murphy", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5624f4c4/turbine/ct-tbs-nlcs-broadcast-greenstein-spt-1019-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:33:37.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
