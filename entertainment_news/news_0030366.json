For one, it was almost entirely instrumental and while very stately and graceful, there was a feeling that it could well have been a double or even a four-disk set. It also went too much into the 'easy listening' category. This time around, Gilmour puts his foot on the gas pedal and challenged himself to put out something that is layered, reminiscent of something that Floyd would have done in their heyday. The sound overall isn't a far cry from Floyd's smooth sound (think Wish You Were Here) but he also uses that familiar soundstage for further sonic experimentation. Opening the proceedings is 5 A.M, an instrumental that is a fantastic album-opener. The guitar is tastefully applied, with Gilmour opting for economy of sound with his trademark notes backed with oodles of sustain. But just when you think it's time for mellow-land, Rattle That Lock picks up the pace. Immaculately produced, it would could be well at home on say, The Wall. The call-and-response-chorus is almost operatic. And on the classical side, Faces of Stone is surprisingly, dished out in waltz format. You'd certainly not be finding that on a Floyd album! The star instrument of A Boat Lies Waiting is what sounds like a grand piano, with Gilmour's vocals supplemented by old buddies David Crosby and Graham Nash. if you like vocal harmonising, this one will be on repeat for you. Other highlights include Dancing Right In Front of Me, The Girl In the Yellow Dress and In Any Tongue. A must-have for any Floyd fan.\nWATCH: David Gilmour - Rattle That Lock (Official Music Video)\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1v7hXEQhsQ"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T19:31:29.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
