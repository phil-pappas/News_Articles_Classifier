The story is told from the perspective of an undercover FBI informant as he becomes friends with a Muslim person of interest to help build a case against him.\nThe film raises questions about the strategies used in America's counterterrorism efforts and takes many surprising turns. Newsweek called it one of the best documentaries of the year so far. The online entertainment site Vulture said it \"“goes from being a tense procedural and absorbing character study to an astonishing, real-life satire about the surveillance state. You won’t know whether to laugh or cry.”\nThe film won a special jury prize for breakout first feature at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. This week, it was announced that “(T)error” will receive the emerging documentary filmmaker award at December’s IDA Documentary Awards, an annual event held by the International Documentary Association.\n“(T)error is directed by Lyric R. Cabral and David Felix Sutcliffe.\nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.\n'(T)error'\nNot rated\n1 hour, 24 minutes\nFor showtimes and tickets, go to the AMC Fairlane website .", "external_links": ["https://www.amctheatres.com/movie-theatres/detroit/amc-star-fairlane-21", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qudu8SWE1Ho?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:18:07.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
