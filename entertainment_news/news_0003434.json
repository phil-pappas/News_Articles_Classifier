Penguins painting at Adventure Aquarium. Oct. 8, 2015 In an effort to raise funds and awareness for African penguins, the Penguins at Adventure Aquarium are creating artwork that will be available for sale with 100 percent of the proceeds going to SANCCOB. \nThe penguin artwork will be on sale at the aquarium this weekend with 100 percent of the proceeds going to the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) . \nIn an effort to help SANCCOB raise funds and awareness for these penguins, Adventure Aquarium is holding the 7th annual African Penguin Awareness Weekend Celebration Oct. 10 to 12. \nThere are currently 23 happy, \"spoiled\" African penguins living at the aquarium who eat a varied diet three times a day. \nThe penguins who live in South Africa are endangered largely due to oil spills and overfishing destroying their food sources, and nest hunters who remove the guano from the nest because the penguin poo is useful as fertilizer. \n\"Our penguins are spoiled,\" said Kate Budion, biologist II at the aquarium. \"They eat three times a day. Wild penguins in South Africa don't have that luxury.\" \nThe penguins who live at Adventure Aquarium — the oldest which is 28 and the youngest who will turn 1 on Nov. 17 — could never be released back into the wild because they are acclimated to the care they receive from the staff.

They would go up to the first person they saw on the beach and want to be fed.\" \nYet each of the penguins at the aquarium has a unique personality. \n\"Our penguins are like little puppy dogs,\" she said. \"They have completely different personalities. Some love the interaction. But some are more like cats. They want you to feed them, but that's it.\" \nGuests can attend penguin pep rallies at 10:15 a.m. each morning, take a selfie with a penguin, or purchase penguin artwork to help benefit SANCCOB. \n\"Awareness is the big thing,\" Budion said. \"To get people to to know about these penguins and know that when they give money and become aware, it definitely helps the penguins in Africa.\" \nFor more information, visit www.adventureaquarium.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:37:32.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
