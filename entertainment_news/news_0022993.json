Photo: Jason Henry, Special To The Chronicle Image 136 of 136 The 2015 Treasure Island Music Fest offers buzzy acts in an idyllic landscape 1  /  136 Back to Gallery There's a moment at the Treasure Island Music Festival when the sun sets next to the San Francisco city skyline. In some ways, it seems like the most honorable set time the fest can bestow upon an act; like the organizers decided that this or that band's work provides the ultimate ideal soundtrack for something as beautiful as a sunset on the island.\nLike great music, beauty like that is something of a pillar for the festival. One of Treasure Island's big draws is that ticketholders rarely get to experience a concert in such an idyllic landscape, and in the festival's ninth iteration, the scenery again delivers as sublimely as many of its acts.\nRelated Stories Chvrches is taking on the world, starting with Treasure Island Saturday's musical offerings were primarily high-energy sets by young and buzzy artists. Artists like Skylar Spence, Viceroy, and Baio — who were some of the fest's first acts — shook the ground, rolling out bass-thumping songs to get the weekend started. One, the British electronic duo Gorgon City, engaged with the audience effortlessly, particularly on tracks like \"Imagination,\" when guesting female soloist Lulu James approached the mic to create gorgeous vocal tendrils to pair with fast-moving numbers. The crowd rarely stopped dancing.\nAnother highlight was one of the festival's rare hip-hop acts, Run the Jewels, a rap collaboration project by New York's El-P and Atlanta's Killer Mike. Entering the larger Bridge stage to Queen's \"We Are the Champions,\" Run the Jewels paid homage to local soil, shouting out Bay Area icons like Too $hort, Mac Dre, E-40 and even the reigning King of the Court, Steph Curry.\nFKA Twigs, one of the festival's few female performers, writhed and whispered to a captivated audience after the sun set Saturday. A late fill in for the canceled Robyn , the singer and dancer played sultry minimalist hits from new EP \"M3LL155X.\"\nTreasure Island welcomed a brand-new act as well: Big Grams, a collaborative project between alt-pop duo Phantogram and Outkast's Big Boi, who made their live debut on the Bridge stage Saturday night. While the nascent group has typical onstage presence issues to iron out — moments of on-stage interaction seemed forced — the performance of their music was already perfected.\nSunday's lineup was, by contrast, much more guitar-heavy. Musicians from every variation of rock band hit the stage. Groups like the fuzzed-out, assailing post-punk outfit Viet Cong and post riot grrrl trio Ex Hex launched the fest's second day with high energy.\nBy mid-day, however, a welcomed lull hit. Jose Gonzalez, a Swedish performer with Latin American roots, meandered through thoughtful, quasi-pizzicato guitar lines. Gonzalez is one of the few of the fest who cultivated a stage aesthetic to support the music of his set (another was Panda Bear, whose art collage visuals were startling, but fitting), running a visual loop of leaves in inverted colors stirring as the wind breezes by. Watching it felt like hearing a lullaby in many ways, particularly as the sun fell gently next to the stage.\nNot long after, Fleet Foxes alum Joshua Tillman took the same stage. His alter ego (if you can call it that) Father John Misty doesn't take himself too seriously, which is one of his best qualities. Warbling through the satirical \"Bored in the U.S.A.,\" Tillman jumped off the stage to grab a front-row fan's iPhone. She had been filming the song, so the artist took the opportunity to serenade the camera while showing off the audience behind him. \"You'll have to delete some photos from your sister's wedding to make sure that's on there forever,\" he joked before handing it back to her.\nLater on, Scottish trio CHVRCHES were able to break their self-described \" curse of San Francisco \" by making to the stage Sunday night. Led by Lauren Mayberry, the band performed its 45-minute set like headliners, accompanied by a massive orchestrated light show and pitch-perfect vocals, proving that the long wait for their Bay Area festival appearance was well worth it.\nMayberry returned to the stage to join headliners The National for a surprise soft rendition of \"I Need My Girl,\" adding a sweet vocal accent to frontman Matt Beringer's rougher timbre. The audience loved it, of course, and the festival's closing set sent the Treasure Island audience off into the night.\nOverall, the festival's biggest strength was also its drawback, at least in some ways. It seemed that fewer people came to the event than in 2014, but that may be due in part to this year's lineup being saturated with more niche artists.\nBut for many music lovers, that's definitely not a bad thing. With a lineup more closely resembling that of FYF Fest in Los Angeles or Pitchfork in Chicago than Outside Lands, Treasure Island's festival seems to be gunning to establish itself as the go-to destination for fervid, up-to-the-moment music fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:32:50.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
