One, called Legion , will focus on David Haller, an extremely powerful man known primarily for being the son of telepath, Professor X. The other show, Hellfire , will chronicle the infamous Hellfire Club, and their world-domination plans. We were introduced to this group back in X-Men: First Class , so let's see if the two have any similarities (and a better version of Emma Frost). The red flag to come from this announcement is the lack of the term 'mutant' in the press release.
