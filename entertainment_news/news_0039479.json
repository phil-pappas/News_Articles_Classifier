We selected the broker after interviewing three from that area. One aspect of our dealings is surprising. Our broker tells us written offers and counter-offers are not the norm in the Olean area. We have received several verbal \"offers\" and inquiries about the listing price. My experience has been that all offers and counter-offers are done in writing. Is this just a quirk of the Southern Tier, or should we be concerned about the Realtor's approach to selling houses?\n— G.R., Rochester\nThe law known as the Statute of Frauds applies in Olean as it does here. When it comes to the sale of real estate, nothing is binding unless it's in writing. There's no use accepting an oral offer, because you couldn't hold them to it in a court of law.\nPerhaps local custom down there does call for oral negotiations, but you can simply say you're not used to it. Just stick to a polite, \"We'll be happy to consider any written offer.\"\nReverse mortgage for purchase\nI have read you for years, and my husband even took your course years ago! Now I have a question for you.\nThere was an article in the March 21 of the D&C real estate section that sounded like an answer to our retirement woes.\nMy husband is retired, I'll be joining that category soon, we own our home outright in Mendon, but know we cannot support the taxes here when I retire (unless we don't want to have any fun, that is), so we have been looking for a smaller, less costly footprint.\nThe article talked about a Home Equity Conversion program that allows seniors to sell their current residence and use a portion of those proceeds to buy a new home, allowing us to keep the rest of the cash. It stated this loan is a variation of a reverse mortgage and buyers must be older than 65, which we are.\nI have not been able to find much info about this Federal Housing Administration program. The couple in question were purchasing a new town home — hope new is not a requirement!\nMy husband would not consider a reverse mortgage on this home, even though we love it. However, he would consider this new idea!\n— B.P.\nI went back and read the article. That Home Equity Conversion loan is indeed an FHA-insured reverse mortgage. What's different is that instead of taking it out so they could stay in their present residence, those seniors used it to buy a different one.\nA reverse mortgage can now be used to purchase a house, if the elderly buyers are ready — like the downsizing couple in that article — to combine it with a substantial down payment. For that they used some of the cash from the sale of their old home.\nYes, as the article said, no payments will be due until they die. The whole loan — plus accumulated interest — would also become due if they later moved out. You can tell your husband it works like any other reverse mortgage.\nCan co-owners force a sale?\nMy wife and I own half of a vacation condominium property in South Carolina with another couple. The property is deeded Joint with Rights of Survivorship, and we paid all costs equally.\nMy question is this: If my wife and I no longer want to own this property, can the other couple stand in the way of a sale? There is no written or verbal agreement to dictate what should happen (shame on me).\n— C. E., via askedith.com\nIf joint tenants can not agree to sell, any one of them can force a sale and division of the proceeds. The process is known as partition. It involves a court-ordered sale, in many areas similar to a public foreclosure auction. It seldom yields full market value.\nSometimes just mentioning the possibility is enough to move your co-owners to cooperate.\nWhich agent is guilty?\nI must take exception to an answer you provided in a recent column. The reader asked about an agent who took a couple to a listed house and then left them alone to lock up. You suggest that if the seller learned about this, they should cancel the listing.\nIt is not clear the agent in question is the listing agent. Unless you are absolutely sure the listing agent is the one guilty of this infraction, it is unfair to suggest they be fired for it.\nIf the guilty agent is a cooperating agent (from a different brokerage), I am sure the listing agent would be just as upset as the seller. This is a serious ethics violation, and the guilty agent's broker in charge should be notified immediately.\n— M., Broker\nThanks for writing. You make a good point. That negligent broker may well have been from some other real estate firm, rather than the one that listed the property.\nEdith Lank will respond personally to any question sent to www.askedith.com , to edithlank@aol.com , or to 240 Hemingway Drive, Rochester, New York 14620.", "external_links": ["http://www.askedith.com/"], "published": "2015-10-07T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:03:33.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
