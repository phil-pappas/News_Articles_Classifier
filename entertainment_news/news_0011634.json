How could it not be when a team allows nearly four dozen shots on goal?\nWhen you have a goalie who plays really well, that's how.\nDespite the onslaught on shots that Linus Ullmark faced, the Rochester Americans lost just 4-2 to the Utica Comets on Wednesday night.\n\"All the credit goes to him that it was as close as it was,\" Amerks coach Randy Cunneyworth said.\nUllmark allowed just three goals — all to second-year left winger Hunter Shinkaruk — even though the Comets maintained offensive-zone puck control for minutes and minutes at a time. The final Utica goal was scored into an empty net with under two seconds to play by Alexandre Grenier.\n\"They definitely out-everythinged us,\" said Amerks captain Cal O'Reilly, who played as a visitor for the first time in Utica after playing the previous two seasons with the Comets. \"We're still trying to find ourselves. They played desperate. They hadn't won a game (1-2 now) and you could tell.\"\nThe Amerks do have two victories, winning both games on opening weekend on home ice. That included a 2-1 triumph over Utica. Since then they have lost three straight, all on the road, and all in a five-day span.\n\"None of games have really been the hockey we need to play,\" O'Reilly said. \"We have to be better in a lot of aspects.\"\nThe two games against Utica are proof. The Amerks have been outshot a combined 86-36 by the Comets, yet Ullmark's first-star performance on Oct. 10 enabled Rochester to win.\nFor a guy who hadn't played in five months and missed all of training camp as he recovered from surgery on both hips, he has been very good. He has stopped 110 of 118 shots, a .932 save percentage, in three starts. He made 43 saves on Wednesday.\n\"The problem is I've lost two in a row,\" the rookie from Sweden said. \"You're kind of bummed out about that.\n\"If I don't look at the results (a 1-2 record), then I feel secure how things are going. I think I've found my game again.\"\nHe has made a quick adjustment to the North American game, where the ice surface is smaller and plays develop more quickly.\nPlayers have less time with the puck, and forecheckers can be forcing a defender to move the puck with less precision than Ullmark has grown up playing behind.\n\"There's more risk in the game because it's tighter,\" he said.\nUllmark's ability to adapt to a new style of play is hardly a concern for the Amerks. Their play as a team, however, should be cause for concern.\nThey don't spend nearly enough time in the attacking zone and they have difficulty exiting their own zone cleanly. They also don't win many puck battles.\n\"When there are confrontations for the puck, we have to win,\" Cunneyworth said.\nThey may not have had more than two shots off a rebound on Wednesday. Jason Akeson drove a shot past screened goalie Joe Cannata to tie the score 1-1 midway through the first period and Jerome Leduc drilled a one-timer home on a power play to make it 3-2 with 4:58 left.\nKEVINO@gannett.com\nKevin's 3 stars\n1.
