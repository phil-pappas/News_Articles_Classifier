Jones will be staying at a five-star hotel in Mumbai, and a customized bed has been crafted for him. A luxurious suite with ample head room has also been booked. An eight-foot bed is being made, and a premium SUV is being modified with the front seats removed for Jones’ journey within the city. \nJones’ Hollywood agents have been working with the Balaji team, and it is the first time ever that so much effort is being made for the international wrestling star. \nSays director D’Souza: “Nathan’s physique is unique and befits the super-villain’s character in the film to the T. We waited for months to rope him in and wouldn’t want a thing to be amiss during his stay.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:29:50.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
