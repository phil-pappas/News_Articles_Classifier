I really appreciate it. I always wanted to be an actress,” the iconic pop singer, Lady Gaga, said as she walked into the Art Deco set of FX’s hit horror-drama “American Horror Story: Hotel,” now on its fifth season.\nMaking her TV series debut, she plays the bloodsucking fashionista The Countess Elizabeth, the owner of the enigmatic Hotel Cortez in Los Angeles, California. She is enjoying every minute of being creator-director-writer Ryan Murphy’s new muse.\nLADY GAGA (Photo by Ruben V. Nepales)\nIn a separate interview, Ryan revealed, “I was shocked. She called me up and she couldn’t have been nicer… At first I thought I was being punked. But she had always been somebody who I had loved.” He recalled her being gracious about using her songs for Ryan’s show, “Glee.”\nHe added, “She said, ‘I really want to do something different and I love the show. Would you do something with me?’”\nWhat was originally supposed to be a smaller part over seven or eight episodes turned into something bigger. She loved the experience so much she wanted to complete the story of her character. “It’s been one of the most joyous things in my career,” Ryan said.\nHe added, “It’s rare for me to be intimidated by people but I was intimidated by her because she has such power and she has the ability to bring such change in the culture, which she has done time and time again. But when you talk to her, she is such a joy. She’s the most prepared, the most professional, the kindest… she’s like a Mother Hen on the set.”\nHe thought she looked like “an old school movie star,” reminding him of Barbara Stanwyck. “Her skin holds the light like Marilyn Monroe’s did. She’s a great actress. She’s committed and she’s involved in every step of the game. And she’s excited to be with us.”\nOf her character, Gaga said, “I am a monster, but in the most grand, amazing, glamorous way. Being alive over 100 years, she has not only learned a lot of lessons, but she has become strong in her vulnerability.” For her, the character’s feminine wisdom “comes from a place of sexual power. She is 25 forever.”\nShe believes “on the outside she is quite young and naïve, but on the inside she is wise… she is ancient. It is her intelligence that makes her powerful and that is what I hope for women and men to take away from her as a character – her agility within this chaos (is what) makes her what she is.”\nLADY GAGA in ‘American Horror Story: Hotel’ as The Countess Elizabeth\nHer transition to acting isn’t surprising. “I am not acting when I am Gaga,” she said. “That is part of me and, in a way; I am not acting when I am The Countess. Where I am in my life and which stage, that is who I am and where I exist in that moment. And I am grateful that I am allowed to have that…”\nGaga studied method acting for almost 10 years. “I studied Strasberg… arguably the most dangerous form of method acting where you embrace becoming the character and call upon sensory from your life that is so powerful it takes you back implicitly to a place that you remember as a child…”\nHer method involves losing herself to the process.\n“When I am here, I am more loyal to Ryan than I am even to myself at the moment, because he is the artist. And there’s nothing that I ever wanted more and I am going to say I always wanted to be an actress, and what I mean is, it was never important to me that I was in control of the art (but) that I allow the art to be in control of me. I am a romantic… That is a freedom that I am not allowed on my own. And that’s why I like being an actress, because I am simply here to serve the giver.”\nWhat surprised her about the acting process?\n“On my first day of work, I got a note from Sarah Paulson (who portrays Sally in the show) and she said, ‘You belong here, just let it fly.’ And a few years ago, I stopped letting it fly because I felt so judged and it’s not because I am weak or maybe it is, I don’t care. It’s because I became much more aware of the microscope I was under. I am much more powerful when I am unaware of it.\n“(So) I went on camera and… just let it all go. That’s when Ryan would be like, ‘That’s it.’ So that is why I am so grateful to him because he didn’t just inspire me to be great, he inspired me to be reminded that I am my best when I am myself, which is what I teach my fans…”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:55:33.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
