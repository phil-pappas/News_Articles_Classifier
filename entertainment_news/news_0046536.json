I'm ready to tell that story.\" \nIt was a heartfelt and tearful moment from the usually bubbly teen. \n\"This dance is for my dad and my family and for everyone back home,\" she said after the performance. \nShe was awarded 28 points out of 30, including the first perfect score of the season, from the show's judging panel. \n\"He was dancing with you every step of the way,\" Bruno Tonioli said. I love you. Thank you for always being with me, wherever I go. pic.twitter.com/OPlmYBGLTZ â€” Bindi Irwin (@BindiIrwin) October 6, 2015 \nThe routine shot Irwin to the top of the DWTS leader board ahead of Nick Carter, who paid tribute to his years in the boy band Backstreet Boys. \nEarlier in the week Irwin also thanked her ballroom mentor Hough, describing him as a big brother who helped her get through the emotionally draining routine. \n\"We all felt like we knew him; it reminds you of how precious life is,\" Hough said. \nNext week the celebrities will dance with a different partner, chosen by the viewers, in the show's switch-up week.
