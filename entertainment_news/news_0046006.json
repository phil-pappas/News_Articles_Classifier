He recently curated more than 200 images from his website to create a book full of \"cabin porn.\"\nOur first film collaboration premieres today.

It seems to be taking over everything in our lives and getting outside, unplugging, kind of disconnecting is an essential part of staying sane and healthy and happy in today's world.\"\nWhile Klein admits he is no Henry David Thoreau, he says the true beauty of Beaver Brook is in sharing it. Because the devices that normally connect us don't work here, a different kind of social network can take shape.\n\"There's no cell reception, no electricity, no plumbing--no nothing,\" said Klein. \"It's about building relationships with each other through projects that we find rewarding.\"\nBut as rewarding as living in the woods with his family and friends can be, it is not a year-round endeavor. Klein still spends most days plugged in, most recently as the CEO of an online school called DIY. But for about six weeks a year, he recharges right here at Beaver Brook.\n\"The Internet is pretty one-dimensional when you compare it to a massive plot of woods like this,\" he said. \"There are so many wonders to beholden here. You just have to look at the ground to see them.\"\nAnd Klein says what may be the best discovery about being a cabin in the woods is that it is affordable.\n\"New York State, you could get an acre of agricultural land for about three-thousand bucks which is the price some people pay for their television,\" Klein said. \"And I think what's really compelling to people is the realization that this simplicity that they are interpreting as a luxury is actually pretty obtainable for anybody that wants it.\"", "external_links": ["http://cabinporn.com/", "https://instagram.com/p/8EDoo4Bl8U/", "https://instagram.com/p/5aIS9xBlzf/", "https://instagram.com/p/8LY_nYBl40/"], "published": "2015-09-29T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:44:42.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
