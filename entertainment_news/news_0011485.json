Hear what Jamie and Adam have to say about that, and see what's in store for the FINAL season. on.aol.com Entertainment Weekly announced on Wednesday that bad news that the next season of the long-running Discovery Channel series “Mythbusters,” which starts next January, will be its last. The idea that there would come a time when Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman will not blow things up, drop objects from great heights, and otherwise examine urban myths for fun and science seems inexplicable. But there it is.\nPhoto by Noel Vasquez/Getty Images The concept behind “ Mythbusters ” was deceptively simple. Find a story that describes some incredible thing happening and try to recreate it using the tools of engineering and science. Savage and Hyneman are Hollywood special effects artists and were thus highly suited for such tasks. For most of the run of the series, a B team consisting of Kari Byron, Grant Imahara, and Tory Belleci, handled various myths as well.\nWhat sort of myths got busted? The very first episode dealt with the story of a man who is alleged to have attached a JATO rocket to his car and lit it up to provide some extra propulsion. The results, as the story goes, were not pretty.\nAnother myth concerned whether the story that Archimedes managed to set Roman warships on fire using reflected light from bronze shields, the earliest documented example of a beam weapon. This myth was examined twice, the second time (so it was depicted) on direct instructions of President Barack Obama.\\\nThe most memorable myth that got busted was the Apollo moon landing hoax theory. Both teams of Mythbusters, using science, determined that the objections of the Apollo moon landing hoaxers are bogus and that, in fact, men really did land on the moon decades ago.\nThe Discovery Channel no doubt think they have business reasons for canceling its most popular and memorable program. One can only hope that the concept will live on and that, in the fullness of time, “Mythbusters” will rise again. Kari, Grant, and Tory were let go for the last season. The network would be well advised to bring them back and make them the A team for a revival of “Mythbusters.” As someone once said, the show could go on forever, so long as people persist in believing stupid – er – stuff.", "external_links": ["http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/21/mythbusters-ending-interview", "http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/?rfc=1"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:37:57.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
