READ MORE: 'Bake Off' Star Tamal Reveals He's Gay \nThe TV chef made her comments in the Sunday Times’ food magazine, The Dish, insisting that as long as she’s on telly, she’s trying to keep off the pounds. \nShe explains: “I eat carefully because people don't want to see a large person judging cakes. They'll think to themselves, ‘that's what happens when if you eat cake’.” \nMary Berry \nHer comments come after her fellow judge, Paul Hollywood , admitted he’d sacrificed his trim figure for the world of baking, claiming that tasting treats for a living had led him to put on weight. \nPaul Hollywood and Mary Berry at the NTAs, back in January \nAs reported in the Express, he said that weight gain was inevitable given his choice of profession, saying: “You put on some pounds but then if it's a heavy day I don't have dinner. If it's a three-layer cake, then that can be a struggle!” \nThis year’s ‘Bake Off’ comes to a close this week, with just three bakers, Nadiya, Tamal and Ian, left in the competition. \n“But I hope that week by week people have realised that I can bake - and just because I'm not a stereotypical British person, it doesn't mean that I am not into bunting, cake and tea.” \nThe ‘Great British Bake Off’ concludes on Wednesday (7 October) night, on BBC One. Close 'Great British Bake Off': Where Are They Now? of   Fresh from being crowned the winner of the first ever ‘Bake Off’, Ed quit his day job as a debt collector for Yorkshire Bank (which he hated) to follow his baking dream with a job in Raymond Blanc’s restaurant Le Manoir as a pastry chef (what else?). He’s gone on to carve himself a career as a food writer with articles appearing in BBC Good Food magazine and on his blog theboywhobakes.co.uk. In 2011 he published his first cookbook, ran a pop-up bakery in Fortnum & Mason and is also the resident baker on ‘The Alan Titchmarsh Show’. “Bake Off changed [my life] in the most amazing way. It allowed me to follow my passion and fulfil my dreams in a way I never imagined,” he said recently. After winning the second series of ‘Bake Off’, Jo started her own cooking school. Based at her home in Essex, Jo teaches classes on home-baking such as bread making and cupcake decorating. She has also published two cookbooks, ‘A Passion For Cooking’ and ‘Home Baking’ and is a regular food columnist for The Sun and Sainsbury’s Magazine. John hasn’t stopped working since winning series three. As well as publishing two cookbooks, ‘John Whaites Bakes’ and John Whaites Bakes At Home’, he earned a patisserie diploma from Le Cordon Bleu, launched his own online chocolate shop The Hungry Dog Artisan Chocolates and is set to launch his own cookery school, John Whaite’s Kitchen. On top of all that he’s also the resident baker on Lorraine Kelly’s ITV morning show. Phew! Frances, who won the fourth series in 2013, is best remembered for her highly creative designs and has gone on to share her skills at shows and festivals around the UK. Many of her recipes have also appeared in newspapers and magazines and she’s also popped up on many TV and radio shows. Her first book ‘Quinntessential Baking’ is set to be published on 27 August and promises to be \"a treasure trove of inspirational ideas to bring a spark of creativity and a teaspoon of wonder into your kitchen.\" Former GP surgery manager Nancy, who was crowned champion at the end of last year’s series, has gone on to launch her own baking website www.nancybirtwhistle.co.uk where she shares receipes with fans. The 60-year-old is also in demand for everything from cookery demonstrations to after-dinner speaking and is currently writing an encyclopedia of baking. Mary-Anne was pipped to the post in the 2011 final but has gone on to launch her own blog timetocookonline.com and is about to opublish her very first book ‘Great British Cakes’ which has already had mary berry’s seal of approval, saying it was ‘brilliantly researched from a true foodie’. After coming second on the third series, Glaswegian James has amassed a huge fanbase thanks to his baking blog and regular column in the Sunday Mail newspaper. He’s also had two books published, the first of which, ‘Brilliant Bread’, won the Guild of Food Writers award for Best Cookbook in 2014. Earlier this year he beat Michel Roux Jr to win Radio Times Food Champion but despite his baking success he is still studying to become a doctor at the University of Glasgow. She might not have won the 2013 series but Ruby has just been voted Bake Off’s favourite ever contestant by readers of Radio Times. Since appearing on the show, Ruby has written a book called ‘Crumb’ and recorded her own documentary for Radio 4. She also has her own blog rubyandthekitchen.co.uk and writes a weekly recipe column for The Guardian. In April this year she announced she was gay on Twitter and also hit back at the trolls who suggested there was chemistry between her and judge Paul Hollywood. She tweeted: “For those who thought I fancied Paul Hollywood or that I'd ever bang him to get ahead - JOKE'S ON YOU, YOU MASSIVE SHITTING MISOGYNISTS.” Howard proved to be an instant hit with ‘Bake Off’ viewers when he appeared on the 2013 series. The council worker, who provided some of the most memorable moments (remember custard-gate? Or the missing trifle?), is set to publish his first book ‘Delicious Gluten-Free Baking’ in September. Speaking about his time on the show recently, he said: “My greatest memory is having met such a wonderful bunch of people and it is one of those things that continues. It exists outside of that and that is a pleasure really.” At just 17 years old, Martha was the youngest ever contestant to appear on ‘Bake Off’, but despite her years, she went on to reach the quarter finals. So it’s no surprise that since appearing on the show, Martha has not only launched her own successful baking blog but has also landed herself a column in the Waitrose Weekend newspaper, alongside the likes of Pippa Middleton, Clare Balding, and Mariella Frostrup. On top of this, she spent her half-term break in Cambodia as an ambassador for the Tearfund charity where she visited victims of child trafficking and held baking workshops with them. Richard was an early favourite to win last year’s ‘Bake Off’ but despite not walking away with the title he’s gone on to enjoy success outside of his building business. As well as his popular blog, richardburr.london, he regularly appears at food festivals around the country and has just published his first book, ‘B.I.Y. Bake It Yourself’ (see what they did there?).  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:34:57.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
