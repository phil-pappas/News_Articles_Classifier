It's really, really well-written (and so far, well-edited and -proofed as well, which is only what I would expect from a skilled colleague like Randi, but isn't always in the author's control these days). The narrative nonfiction genre isn't her usual voice - she's better known for her \"Passport: series of guides to the national parks, and for her several books on regional day hikes, waterfalls and birding spots (all of which benefit from her husband Nick's stellar nature photography). This collection of insights into ghosts and goblins around our fair state is a lot of fun, backed up by the solid research and reporting that I've always known as one of Randi's strengths. Cheers, Randi!
