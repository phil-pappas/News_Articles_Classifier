If the works were from the past, they looked different because some new faces and bodies have been added to the veteran dancers, including many who have stayed with Mateo for years. The popular choreographer/teacher is known for constructing abstract ballets to classical music, however, when men and women appear on stage together, it’s difficult not to imagine a scenario for their relationships. The program opened with the somber “Isle of the Dead,” music by Sergei Rachmaninoff, for one leading couple, backed by a corps de ballet. The ballet begins with a stunning first scene that finds each dancer isolated from the other, kneeling in his or own spotlight. Gradually they move together, then pick up the tempo to rush from one side of the large stage space to the other in unison, finally breaking into pairs. The men took turns partnering the women, to lift them high in the air in various shapes around their bodies. For one lift, the men had the women draped down behind their backs, as if they were cloaks to be wrapped around their shoulders against the cold. In a slowly winding pas de deux, Madeline Bonn, arguably Mateo’s leading woman dancer, was dragged, posed and turned by newcomer, Stephen James. Suddenly, after they had left the stage, the men returned to drop to the floor. Bonn hovered behind them like an Angel of Mercy, finally stepping carefully over their still figures. In another scene, one particularly lovely trio of women – Bonn, Joanna Binney and Lauren Gauther – re-created the image of the “Three Graces” by linking hands and pacing on point across the back of the stage. The overall effect suggested a glimpse of life in the Kingdom of the Shades, or the Underworld of antiquity. “Circles,” set to a score by Alfred Schnittke, takes the viewers to a different world, where the dancers become definite characters, engrossed in their desires and fears. Again, we might be watching a myth, this time about a woman of clouded mind (Magdalena Gyftopoulos) who seems under the spell of an evil being. However, rather than the enchanted Swan Queen and the magician, Rothbart, of “Swan Lake,” this woman might be a peasant. She sits on a step where she marks circles in the sand with one finger. A dominating and cruel man (Junichi Fukuda) suddenly appears watching her. She is alternately drawn in and repulsed by him, then alarmed by her rival for his attention (Haruka Tamura). Two other couples are drawn into the conflict: Jaclyn Sanford (from Hingham) in a fluid and assured performance, and Binney, partnered by Ryan Bulson and Jayson Douglas. Spencer Doru Keith, the decent man who loves the troubled Gyftopoulos is overcome by the power of darkness at the end. This stark mini-drama was enhanced by Gyftopoulos who is as gifted an actor as a dancer. She was the one to watch, with a face and large eyes that telegraphed the conflicts roiling her mind. The movement created by Mateo, both in the large patterns of the choreography swirling around the stage and the gestures of arms curling around the heads, echoed the title of the ballet. The program finale, “Covens,” choreographed to a piece of contemporary music, “Symphony No. 3, Confessional of Isabel Gowdie,” follows the story line suggested by the Scottish composer, James MacMillan. In a nod to the approach of Halloween, the story follows the music, a memorial to a witch who was burned at the stake in the 17th century. Angie DeWolf is cast as the innocent, dressed in a short, pink leotard. She is partnered by Keith who loves her, but they are both overwhelmed by a circle of 10 harpies in dark green leotards, led by the tall, unyielding Brittany Bush and her men servants. The music is alternately calm but later broken by huge crashes and screeches, giving an unsettling aural background to the drama of one woman crushed by the crowd. As the evening’s program made clear, Mateo’s new men need more training before they look totally comfortable in his works. The 30th season continues with Mateo’s annual production of “The Nutcracker,” which moves to Emerson Majestic Theater, Nov. 27-Dec. 6, and The Strand in Dorchester, Dec. 11-12, with new sets and some new costumes, a big leap for the company in its’ return to downtown Boston for the first time in 15 years.
