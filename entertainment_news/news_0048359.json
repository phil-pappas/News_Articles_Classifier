This month we give equal time to the noncanine crowd: cats, horses, elephants, birds and guinea pigs. Still waiting to hear from the goldfish and ferret lobbies.\n\"The Old Man and the Cat: A Love Story\" by Nils Uddenberg (Thomas Dunne Books): Uddenberg, a retired psychology professor, never had a pet until he was adopted by a stray cat that showed up at his home one cold winter day. Translated from the original Swedish, \"The Old Man and the Cat\" describes the bond that developed between the two — much to the author's amazement. A charming tale.\n\"Men & Cats\" by Marie-Eva Gatuingt and Alice Chaygneaud (Perigee): Take photos of hot guys posing, many of them shirtless, and pair them with photos of cats in similar poses. As simple as that, you have a book.\n\"Unspoken Messages: Spiritual Lessons I Learned From Horses and Other Earthbound Souls\" (Balboa Press) by Richard D. Rowland: Rowland spent 28 years as a state police officer before retiring and running an equine boarding facility in Kentucky. Diagnosed with terminal multiple myeloma, he writes about the lessons of hope and positivity he has learned from horses.\n\"A Guinea Pig Pride & Prejudice\" by Jane Austen, Tess Gammell and Alex Goodwin (Bloomsbury): It has been more than 200 years since Austen penned her novel, but we finally have a version of the book that substitutes guinea pigs for humans. Guinea pig trainers and miniature set designers have teamed up on the project, which is a lot of fun.\n\"Women Who Still Love Cats Too Much\" by Allia Zobel Nolan (Health Publishing): With cartoons by Nicole Hollander (\"Sylvia\"), this humorous little book will help women recognize and accept their cat codependency.\n\"Owls: Our Most Charming Bird\" by Matt Sewell (Ten Speed Press): Who doesn't love owls? Ornithologist and artist Sewell obviously does, as evidenced in his latest book. He looks at some four dozen species of owls, writing a paragraph or two about each and illustrating it with one of his drawings. He doesn't get overly technical or scientific, making \"Owls\" attractive for younger readers too.\n\"Birding for the Curious: The Easiest Way for Anyone to Explore the Incredible World of Birds\" by Nate Swick (Page Street Publishing): If you've considered getting into birding, this book is for you. Swick, a 20-year aficionado, is the editor of the American Birding Association's blog, and over 10 chapters, he presents a thorough explanation of how to get involved.\n\"Elephant House\" by Dick Blau and Nigel Rothfels (Pennsylvania State University Press): Photographer Blau and historian Rothfels document the lives of the animals living in the Oregon Zoo's Asian Elephant Building, as well as the building itself, which was demolished in this year to make way for the new Elephant Lands habitat. It's a nice scrapbook of lovely stories and wonderful photos.\n\"A Gift From Bob\" by James Bowen (Thomas Dunne Books): In a follow-up to the successful \"A Street Cat Named Bob\" and \"The World According to Bob,\" Bowen tells the story of how Bob, a cat he rescued from the streets of London, taught him the true meaning of Christmas.\n\"The Cat's Out of the Bag: Truth and Lies About Cats\" by Max Cryer (Exisle Publishing): One need not be an ailurophile to enjoy Cryer's examination of all things cat — the origins of phrases such as \"it's raining cats and dogs,\" a look at felines' sense of hearing and eating habits, cat fables and cats in music. And an ailurophile? A person who loves cats.\n\"Stallside: My Life With Horses & Other Characters\" by Matthew Eliott (River Horse Press): Of the 72 students who graduated in his class from veterinary school, Eliott was the only one who chose to work just with horses. Over his career, he kept track of some of his more interesting patients and their stories, and he has turned it into a very readable and enjoyable book.\nbhageman@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune The Pennsylvania State University", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56169cb3/turbine/sc-pet-books-family-1013-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:37:08.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
