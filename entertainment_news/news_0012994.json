The team didn't specify what the procedure was. \nDoctors advised Scully to skip the playoffs in order to rest up. Scully, who turns 88 in November, said in August he expects next season will be his last in the booth. His 66 years with the Dodgers are a broadcasting record for the same big league franchise. \nScully missed the team's final series of the regular season because of a cold, and he wasn't in San Francisco for a four-game trip earlier last week because of a scheduled absence. \nThe NL West champion Dodgers face the NL East champion New York Mets in the NL Division Series starting Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:07:22.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
