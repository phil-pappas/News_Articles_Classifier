I mean, with #CradleToGrave out there your work is done. \n— Danny Baker (@prodnose) October 13, 2015 Thanks Danny. With Series Two commissioned all is well. Thank you for working with us on it! https://t.co/0RzCiEmKmz \n— Danny Cohen (@DannyCohen) October 13, 2015 \nA BBC spokesperson told Digital Spy: “We’re having active conversations about a further series of Cradle To Grave. It’s too early to confirm any details.” \nBased on the journalist and comedy writer’s memoir Going To Sea In A Sieve, Cradle To Grave stars Laurie Kynaston as a young Danny. Peter Kay plays his father Fred – with a cockney accent. \nThe comedy is set in 1970s Bermondsey. Peter Kay and Danny Baker (BBC) \nIn August, Danny Baker confirmed he had already started work on writing series two, with fellow scriptwriter Jeff Pope. \nWhile on holiday together with their families in Florida, the two started putting together some scenes for another series, he told Radio Times. \n“It may have been a bit presumptuous of us but we couldn’t help ourselves,” he said. “These are the kind of conversations we have anyway.” Wonderful good news about #CradleToGrave of course. And here is moment the core cast met for the very first time. pic.twitter.com/KGXAglmAqV \n— Danny Baker (@prodnose) October 13, 2015 \nBBC Two controller Kim Shillinglaw told the Radio Times she hoped to recommission the series: “We have some big talent involved – Peter [Kay], Danny [Baker], people whose commitments have to be juggled but we are really, really keen. Doing comedy at nine and nine thirty has really worked.” Share article \nThe first series ends on Thursday, October 15 on BBC Two.
