(Photo: Dana Edelson, NBC) \nWhen it was announced that Eddie Murphy would return to Studio 8H for Saturday Night Live 's 40th Anniversary special, we were all waiting to see what the legendary comedian would bring to the stage. But instead of performing , Murphy gave a short, awkward \"thank you\" speech and then threw to a commercial break. Talk about anticlimactic. \nFellow SNL alum Norm Macdonald gave us a hint after the special aired, when he tweeted about what went on behind the scenes, revealing that they had asked Murphy to play Bill Cosby in the \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch and Murphy had said no (the part was eventually filled by current cast member Kenan Thompson). Now Murphy is opening up about why he turned the part down. \nIn an extensive interview with The Washington Post , Murphy explained that he simply didn't want to do the sketch because he didn't think it was a topic we should be joking about: \n\"I totally understood (why they wanted me to do it). It was the biggest thing in the news at the time. I can see why they thought it would be funny, and the sketch that Norm (Macdonald) wrote was hysterical. ... There’s nothing funny about it. If you get up there and you crack jokes about him, you’re just hurting people. You’re hurting him. You’re hurting his accusers. I was like, 'Hey, I’m coming back to SNL for the anniversary, I’m not turning my moment on the show into this other thing.'\" \nMurphy also talked about whether or not he may return to the stand-up stage any time in the future (he hasn't done a stand-up act in 29 years): \n\"That’s the carrot. Every now and then when I think about it, I think, What would I even talk about onstage? It’s never been, I wonder if I’m funny. I wonder if I can come up with jokes. It’s more, What would it be like without the leather suit and the anger?\" \nWe think it would be pretty funny, if you're asking us.
