In July, the four surviving members of the Grateful Dead, including Lesh, gave what they said will be their last group performance at Chicago's Soldier Field.\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:24:51.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
