By Seth G. Macy \nThe top selling game for September was NBA 2K16 , according to numbers released by the NPD Group today. In second place, another sports game, EA's Madden NFL 16, made another appearance on the NPD Group's top 10 chart. In fact, 4 of the 10 games on the list were annualized sports games. \nAccording to the NPD Group, the sports genre accounted for \"32 percent of units and 39 percent of revenue\" for the month of September. \nAs far as single-platform games, Super Mario Maker for Wii U had the distinction of being the only console exclusive to show up on the chart at an impressive number 6 spot. Minecraft held on at number 10, showing the game's enormous popularity still has a lot of momentum. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. \nSeptember's top 10 selling games were as follows: NBA 2K16 (PS4, Xbox One, 360, PS3) Madden NFL 16 (PS4, Xbox One, 360, PS3) Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (PS4, Xbox One, PS3, 360) FIFA 16 (PS4, Xbox One, 360, PS3) Destiny: The Taken King (Xbox One, PS4, 360, PS3) Super Mario Maker (Wii U) Disney Infinity 3.0 (360, Wii U, Xbox One, PS4, PS3) Mad Max (PS4, Xbox One) NHL 16 (Xbox One, PS4, 360, PS3) Minecraft (360, PS3, Xbox One, PS4) \nIn spite of strong showings for the month, sales \"declined a modest 3 percent\" over the same period last year. The numbers for September 2014 were buoyed by the release of Destiny and Super Smash Bros. for the 3DS, and this year no titles were able to generate the same amount of excitement sales-wise for the month. \nThe top console for the month was once again Sony's PlayStation 4, continuing a trend that has almost been unbroken since the console first released. \nSeth Macy is a freelance writer who just wants to be your friend.
