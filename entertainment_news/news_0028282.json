He had been the Triangle Club's part-time accountant for 20 years, earning $4,000 a year. \nBefore his arrest in 2013, Esquire magazine named Muza an \"employee of the month.\" He was described by a boss as someone who \"gives more of himself than one can reasonably expect from anyone.\" \nIn March, the 55-year-old pleaded guilty to theft by unlawful taking. \nMuza admitted he wrote Triangle Club checks to himself to pay his mortgage, credit cards and utility bills. \nMembers of the club have included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jimmy Stewart and Brooke Shields.
