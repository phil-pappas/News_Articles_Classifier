Puri, who was addressing the delegates on the concluding day of three- day SAARC Sufi festival here, said that Sufism is a great binding force.

But there is a definite problem in understanding the religion of each other that often causes misunderstanding and leads to chaotic situation,” he said. Once the people of India and Pakistan understand the religions of the two countries, he said, a lot of problems particularly those relating to terrorism would be solved. \n  9:05 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:59:30.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
