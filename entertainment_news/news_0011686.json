Allies become adversaries and adversaries become allies, both inside and outside the family, as Joy's inner life and fierce imagination carry her through the storm she faces. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro star in the film. David O. Russell who directed Lawrence and Cooper in \" Silver Linings Playbook \" and \" American Hustle \" serves behind the lens for this one. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Joy News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:52:55.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
