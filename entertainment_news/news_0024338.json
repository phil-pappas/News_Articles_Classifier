Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, also received poor rains this year, with a deficit of 35 per cent, an official of the Chandigarh’s Meteorological Department told PTI here today.

The rain deficit was hovering over 40 per cent in Punjab until a fortnight back, MeT official said, adding that good amount of rains in the state later helped bring down the deficit to minus 31 per cent. In Haryana, where many places in northern parts received good rainfall recently, the overall deficit for the state stands at 38 per cent, he said. \nBetween June 1 and September 30, Punjab received rainfall of 338 mm against normal of 491.5 mm, leaving the deficit at 31 per cent. In comparison, Haryana received 287.7 mm rain during the period against a normal of 460.4 mm, with deficit at 38 per cent, which is much more than its neighbouring state, he said. \nChandigarh received 548.3 mm of rain between June 1 and September 30 against the normal of 844.2 mm, resulting in a deficit of 35 per cent, the official said. According to the official, the rain deficit in Union Territory Chandigarh had also come down slightly from 43 per cent earlier due to good rains two weeks back. \nUncertain weather this year, including erratic and weak monsoon, has been the bane of farmers of the country’s grain bowl states. Earlier this year, the farmers had to face vagaries of the weather as their crops suffered damage due to unseasonal heavy rains and hailstorm in March. Later the ‘white fly pest’ attack, which damaged the cotton crop in many parts of Punjab and Haryana, added to their woes. \nIn Punjab, Amritsar received 376.4 mm against normal of 537.6 mm, leaving a deficit minus 30 per cent while Bathinda received 260.3 mm against normal of 321 mm, with deficit of minus 19 per cent, during the June 1-September 30 period, the official said. He further said that Ludhiana received 435.4 mm of rain against normal of 534.2 mm, with deficit of minus 18 per cent. As against this, Mansa had poor rains at just 85.5 mm during the period against normal of 334.8 mm, leaving a huge deficit at minus 74 per cent, he said. \nDistricts in Punjab that recorded poor rainfall includes Tarn Taran with 194.5 mm of rain, against normal of 336.8.7. It left a deficit of minus 42 per cent, MeT official said. Moga had 235.4 mm of rainfall during the period against normal of 364, with deficit at minus 34 per cent, he said. According to the official, Ambala in Haryana had 459.6 mm rains during the period of June 1-September 30 against a normal of 916.6 mm and left a deficit of 50 per cent. \nFatehabad had 114.8 mm rain against 283 mm, with deficit hovering at 59 per cent; Rohtak had 194.7 mm rain as against 508 mm normal, thus leaving deficit of minus 62 per cent, he said. However, the places which received comparatively better rainfall includes Panipat, which had 365.5 mm rains during the period as against normal of 521.7 mm, leaving a deficit of 30 per cent. Sonepat had 348.2 mm against a normal of 534.3 mm, leaving a deficit of 35 per cent while Karnal had 449.9 mm against normal of 577 mm, with deficit hovering at minus 22 per cent, the official said. \n  3:49 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:51:16.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
