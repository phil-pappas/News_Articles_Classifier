The plot is pretty standard fare, with three employees: Jane (Carolyn Salter), Phil (Phil Cormier) and Victor (James Haupt) just trying to make it through another boring day in the office when their eccentric boss, Ted (hilariously played by Ed Knights, who proves certain middle-aged men should never use urban lingo like “word” or “homie”), announces that he will be promoting one of them. Victor is the office IT wizard but also a chronic liar, which comes into play when Jane and his supervisor Stephanie (Christine Guertin) uncover that the framed picture of his “son” on his desk (a “son” whom he uses to get out of many office detail assignments) is nothing but a picture of the child whose picture came with the store-bought frame. The duo advises Ted to confront Victor about this deception. To try to avoid being discovered, Victor uses a homeless woman (played to the hilt by Amy Newberg) to play the “mother” of their “son.” These are some of the most entertaining scenes of the show, thanks to both Newberg and Haupt. The company is also undergoing an IRS audit. Agent (Judy Gentry) comes in late in the second act and the subplot doesn’t add much to the show. Phil Cormier does an outstanding job with the material, overcoming seemingly being miscast in a role that seems to have been written with someone younger and with a much larger physical presence in mind. Jeff Van Amburgh plays Zerbeck, Stephanie’s cousin, who arrives from a foreign land to begin working in the office literally three hours after arriving in America. Van Amburgh is involved in some of the most humorous moments of the second act — so much so that you almost wish he had arrived earlier in the show. The show's pacing was at times a bit uneven but, under the direction of Ned Cheesman, the character performances were absolutely solid throughout. Sometimes, when brisk comedic delivery appeared to be called for, there was instead more emoting and thought being used on lines that did not call for it, and as a result, a few of the expected laughs fell flat. While the show seems as though it would work better in a smaller, more intimate venue, kudos to set design by Hal Smith and Bob DiPippa, which turns the large stage into a stereotypical, almost antiseptic, bland, character-free office: Huge blue walls with little pictures adorning them, several blue partitions and three small metal desks which, when combined, seem to help suck out any hope of individuality, personality or self-expression, which is in far contrast to the antics played out by the employees in this show. \"All Play\" runs about two hours with a 15-minute intermission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:51:26.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
