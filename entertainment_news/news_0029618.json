Finance and many others.\nLos Angeles, CA – October 2, 2015 – A feature story about Brent Whitfield was recently seen on CNBC.com as well as the other major online publications such as MarketWatch, Reuters, The Street, Seeking Alpha, Yahoo! Finance, among many others.\nBrent Whitfield, the Founder and CEO of the Los Angeles, California based DCG Technical Solutions – one of Southern California’s premiere IT support and consulting firms, is a successful former commercial photographer whose Los Angeles based studio specialized in large format product and food photography.\nWhitfield made a powerful, entrepreneurial move into the world of computers full time, launching Dependable Computer Guys to address the growing market for reliable expertise in the L.A. area. This was the era of computer megastore chains – many of which notoriously offered substandard help with their products – and he found a niche working with small businesses of 10-150 employees.\nSince this was the mid-90s, his focus was on computers, not networks, and while he became Novell certified in the industry within a year, DCG primarily sold hardware and software and set up and fixed them when they broke. Within a year, his wife, Elizabeth, joined as full partner. By 2003, he was “no hardware, 100% services,” and, with the increased speed of the Internet and growing need for IT services, the company by 2006-2007 was dedicated 100% to providing IT support to small business.\nAs the Whitfields’ turned away from the PC and towards the Internet and networks, the corporate name changed to DCG Technical Solutions, Inc. The company has since become a top provider of outsourced IT help for small to mid-size companies out of their greater Los Angeles location. DCG provides PrivateCLOUD, Internet server and application hosting out of their Los Angeles data center.\nDCG’s ongoing purpose drives everything the company does as it serves a multitude of clients in various “verticals” (industries) throughout Southern California and beyond. It states: “DCG exists to contribute to the success of our clients’ small businesses by helping them Monitor, Manage & Optimize their mission critical information technologies.”\nAccording to Whitfield, the true foundation of DCG’s success is their core values. These are: 1) “We do it now!” 2) Service to the clients above all else; 3) No Cynicism; and 4) Hard Work and Continuous Improvement.\nA unique aspect of DCG’s website is its page about Opportunity – inviting prospective team members to be “a trusted advisor to our clients.” For those looking for a position early in their career, DCG may be the place to discover skills and leadership qualities. The page offers the chance to work with cutting edge technologies and with an elite team of engineers and client service analysts that are committed to helping new hires reach their full potential.\nThe full text of the feature story about Brent that was seen on MarketWatch can be viewed in its entirety at http://blog.dcgla.com/index.php/brent-whitfields-passion-vision-and-commitment-drives-the-core-values-and-success-of-dcg-technical-solutions-2/\n###\nContact:\nKasey Kalchert\n800-980-1626", "external_links": ["http://blog.dcgla.com/index.php/brent-whitfields-passion-vision-and-commitment-drives-the-core-values-and-success-of-dcg-technical-solutions-2/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:28:32.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
