He wrote, \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb... I was raised by my dad with my brother and sister.\" \nKlein's other celebrity clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Cher, Dolly Parton and Goldie Hawn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:59:54.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
