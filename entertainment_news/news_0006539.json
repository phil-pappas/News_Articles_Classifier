Shower or two. Entertainment Queenscliff Music Festival boss Andrew Orvis comes alive to sound of music by: Queenscliiff Music Festival director Andrew Orvis. Picture: Mitch Bear Source: News Corp Australia \nTHERE hasn’t been a Queenscliff Music Festival without Andrew Orvis. \nHaving attended every event since its inception in 1997, he is now putting his own stamp on the festival as its head honcho. \nNow in his second year as director, the 28-year-old has steadily progressed from a humble FReeZA committee volunteer through more influential roles. \nThe Bellarine local knows there is room for improvement and discussion takes a late turn towards the “ultimate goal”: mirroring the likes of Meredith Music Festival’s success in drawing sellout crowds. \n“If I can run that good a festival, that will still have everybody coming, and I’ll still have an awesome line-up but I can get away with putting The Wiggles on the main stage, then that’s probably mission accomplished,” he said. \n“It would be everyone’s highlight, it would really work. They (Meredith) have got to the point where they could get away with that stuff — we’re still not quite at that point.” \nDeadly serious in his assessment, Mr Orvis pauses in reflection of those words, before smiling and asking: “Does that mean I have to call The Wiggles?” \nMr Orvis’ good sense of humour and easygoing nature have helped propel him through countless hours spent shaping the festival, while he “learned everything the hard way” about management in the music industry through first-hand experience.

Picture: Leanne Kelly Source: News Corp Australia \nWhen his goal to pursue a music business course after high school hit the narrowest of ATAR-score snags, Mr Orvis turned to study PE teaching at the University of Ballarat, completing the four-year degree. \nWhile studying, he began organising gigs on-campus and became the manager of Melbourne band The Little Stevies, experiencing a “trial by fire” comprising both “gigs from hell” and “the best shows ever”. \nIn 2005, Mr Orvis’ QMF responsibilities were upgraded to organising the after-party and in 2008, he recalls the festival fell on hard financial times, almost forcing a closure. It was in that year when he took the opportunity to immerse himself deeper into the event’s hierarchy. \n“They were looking for somebody they could employ as an apprentice ... and that happened to be me,” he said. \n“That just grew from two days a week, to three, to four, to five. And now it’s probably about eight days a week.” \nFollowing in the footsteps of Hugo Armstrong, Barbara Moss and Michael Carrucan, Mr Orvis could be booking bands one day and selling tickets the next. \nRather than being able to revel in the festival atmosphere, Mr Orvis gets a different kind of enjoyment, such as seeing the wristband exchange running smoothly or witnessing an appreciative crowd. \nThe Queenscliff Music Festival is held from November 27-29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:59:21.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
