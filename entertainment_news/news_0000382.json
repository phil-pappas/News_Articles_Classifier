On Thursday, before yesterday's Caulfield Cup, we were offered a sneak peek at the David Jones marquee, at its fresh mint and pink hues and chef Guillaume Brahimi's​ menu. It made us wonder, what (else) is making your heart race?\n\"I met a girl,\" Julian Haig said. \"I was in LA; she lives in New York, and she's now my girlfriend and she's coming over in December and the thought of her being here is pretty exciting.\" What does it make your heart do? \"Pound.\"\nAdvertisement \"A surfing yoga retreat,\" designer Margie Woods , half of Viktoria and Woods, said. \"It's a long weekend in Byron Bay with a girlfriend. We've learnt how to surf but we're stepping it up a bit with the sharks in Byron – there's lots of sharks there – so we're going to swim with the sharks and do a bit of yoga to relax.\"\n\"Planning my wedding is making me hysterical,\" Thurley designer Helen O'Connor said. \"I never thought I'd turn into a bridezilla, but I think I just might be doing that. There's a lot yet to come because it's in March.\" As a designer, what's it like designing your own wedding dress? \"So much pressure, and I've already bought $7,000 worth of beads and I'm just about to embark on it.\" You're going to hand-bead it? \"I sure am; that's why I need the five months!\"\n \nA good read on A Secret Garden A Secret Garden by Tommy Collins‏ launch, Federation Square \nThe balmy spring evening seemed to have been ordered especially for the launch of A Secret Garden by Tommy Collins at Federation Square on Thursday night. Saying its name, the community garden, now transformed into an exclusive event space, conjured memories of the beloved children's book, The Secret Garden , so we wanted to know, what was your favourite book growing up?\n\" Snugglepot and Cuddlepie ,\" Susie Robinson said. \"It's so beautiful and it's so Australian. I can walk out into my garden and see those characters.\" And now? \"I'm obsessed with Revolution by Russell Brand. I thought, 'I get that; I agree with that; I get what you're talking about.' It's a bigger look at what's going on and what makes the global community. I like thinking about stuff like that.\"\n\"I was a huge fan of the Grug series,\" said Rachel Holland . And now? \"One of the best books I've ever read is Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk​, really clever.\"\nLuke Gooley 's tastes have developed since his childhood favourite Spot the Dog . \"Have you read Hyperbole and a Half ? Funniest book I've ever read; I've read it two or three times, bursting out laughing.\"\n \nLighting up the northern bank NOTØBERFEST opening, Arbory Bar & Eatery \nIt was a celebration, the opening of NOTØBERFEST, a 10-day festival at Arbory Bar & Eatery, and an invitation to help light up the northern bank of the Yarra with the unveiling of commissioned artwork by Reko Rennie . Amid the bonhomie and between guests' mouthfuls from Nick Bennett 's menu we wanted to know, what should we celebrate that we don't celebrate enough?\n\"A cat's birthday,\" artist Clara Bradley said. Do you celebrate your cat's birthday? \"I do, no one else does. He's five in, like, two weeks.\" What do you have planned? \"He usually has sashimi dinner; he likes salmon; I get take out.\"\n\"I feel like we should celebrate death more,\" said Curtis Cummings . In addition to a funeral? \"I don't know; I just feel like the wake is not very big any more. It should be like the biggest party; everybody just thoroughly enjoying their friend's life.\"\n\"That's a good question,\" Rennie said. \"I think we should celebrate family.\" What should we do? \"Well, there's people that don't have their family here in Australia and people that do and it's just sharing compassion with one another and doing the right thing by other people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:02:27.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
