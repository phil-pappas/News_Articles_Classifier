Two new pictures of the ABC series show the monstrous Inhuman and his menacing figure in details. Lash is a monstrous Inhuman whose loyalties remain ambiguous. Executive Producer Jeffrey Bell explains further about the character to Access Hollywood , \"Lash was an Inhuman out of the comic books, [a] big, unusual looking dude, who seems to be angry about something.\" He adds that fans will \"find out over time\" why that is. Lash is just one of Inhumans to be seen in the third season as Daisy Johnson ( Chloe Bennet ) is assigned by Coulson ( Clark Gregg ) to assemble a new team of super humans. Juan Pablo Raba has been introduced as Inhuman Joey, who is struggling to harness his newfound abilities. \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" airs Tuesdays at 9 P.M. on ABC. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:21.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
