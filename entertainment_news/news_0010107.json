Leslie Martinson's handsome revival of the well-made play, which TheatreWorks Silicon Valley last staged in 2003, adds in the factor of race. In this latest production, the characters are all African-American but the core of the play, with its heady amalgam of wit and romance, remains unchanged, although some of the play's unsettling ambiguities have been lost in this otherwise absorbing production. KEVIN BERNE/THEATREWORKS The complex relationship between Catherine (Michelle Beck, left) and her legendary mathematician father (L. Peter Callender), forms the emotional foundation in \"Proof,\" playing at Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts through Nov. 1. ( tw ) \nSet on the inviting back porch of a ramshackle Chicago house (evocative set by Annie Smart) as fall approaches, the plot spins around 25-year-old Catherine (Michelle Beck), who is reeling from the death of her father Robert. He was a brilliant mathematician who revolutionized his field as a young man and then lost his mind in his later years. In the end it was up to Catherine to drop out of college and take care of him. \nCatherine is having trouble pulling herself out of her quagmire of grief. She doesn't have food in the house when her bossy, go-getter sister Claire (Ashley Bryant) arrives to help with the funeral and she calls the cops on her father's former student Hal (Lance Gardner) after he tries to make off with one of her father's old notebooks. When the police show up at her door, she won't let them in. Advertisement \nBeck captures Catherine's vulnerability and the tenderness of her bond with her father (the always compelling L. Peter Callender) but she never conveys the mental fragility that ought to mark Catherine's character. If there isn't even a thread of uncertainty about Catherine's sanity, the play loses some of its edge. The fear of what we are destined to inherit from our parents should be more palpable. \nSimilarly Gardner is such an affable and exuberant presence as the math geek Hal that he never seems like a real threat to the family's legacy. It's all too clear where the flirtation between Catherine and Hal will lead and that any potholes they encounter will be smoothed over by the last scene. There's also not enough mixed emotions in the exchanges between the sisters where a little more regret amid the feuding would cut closer to the bone. That lack of complication undercuts the play's depth. \nHowever, Auburn's command of the craft is still quite enjoyable in its precision. The playwright teeters between real and imaginary scenes, the past and the present, with crispness and precision so that the narrative snaps together like a satisfying puzzle. Along the way he examines the pervasive gender bias of mathematics, which remains a man's game, and the unexpected elegance of numbers. \nCallender rivets as a man afire with brilliance and ambition, chasing after a theory of everything boiled down into a single glorious equation. His nuanced performance most fully embodies the play's embrace of enigma and the elusive nature of genius. \nThat propulsive tempo gets lost in some of the other scenes and some of the emotional crescendos seem forced but the momentum does build in the play's final moments, when this \"Proof\" is at its most persuasive. \nContact Karen D'Souza at 408-271-3772.
