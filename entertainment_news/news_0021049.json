Khloe Kardashian responds to Amy... \nSwift earned six AMA nominations, including nods for artist of the year, song of the year (\"Blank Space\") and \"collaboration of the year unleashed by T-Mobile,\" as the AMAs call it. The latter was for \"Bad Blood,\" her pairing with Kendrick Lamar. \nRight behind Swift, with five nominations each, were The Weeknd and Ed Sheeran. Both had songs in the song of the year category: The Weeknd with \"Can't Feel My Face\" and Sheeran with \"Thinking Out Loud.\" \nBoth are also part of the expansive artist of the year category, which includes 10 artists, all told. \nOther artist of the year nominees are Luke Bryan, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Nicki Minaj, One Direction, Sam Smith and Meghan Trainor. \nThe AMAs made clever use of social media in announcing the nominations. Six categories were broadcast live on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" followed by five more categories announced via Snapchat. The remaining 12 categories were livestreamed by ABC News. \nFans will be allowed to vote on AMAvote.com, posting on Facebook with a nominee's name and category hashtag or posting on Twitter with a nominee's name, the category name and the #AMA hashtag. \nThe show airs November 22 on ABC. Jennifer Lopez is hosting. \nThe AMAs, which were created by Dick Clark in 1973, based the nominations on \"key fan interactions as reflected in Billboard Magazine and on Billboard.com, including album and digital singles sales, radio airplay, streaming, social activity and touring,\" according to a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:42:19.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
