The party, hosted by the Pixie Woods park board of directors, has traditionally marked the end of the park season as it closes for the winter months. Mary Pinelli, the board’s president, said hundreds of children and adults fill the park each year, adding Pixie Woods has hosted the party for at least 30 years. “We’ve been doing this for many years, and we do it simply for the kids,” she said. “We love seeing them in their costumes. They are just so cute and even some of the parents dress up.” Costumes were not mandatory to join the party, but children who did don Halloween attire were admitted to the park for free. The first 200 children were allowed to pick pumpkins from a patch donated by Dell’Osso Family Farm. The party began at noon, and by 2 p.m. the pumpkins were gone. Guests were also treated to two shows presented by Fratello Marionettes of San Francisco. Board Vice President Peggy Sadek said holding the party this weekend was a better option than Oct. 31, because families will be participating in other activities that night. “We’re just hoping we’re making a lot of kids happy,” she said. “It’s just a lot of fun and it’s great to see the kids in costumes.” Manteca resident Suzette Simas, a former Stockton resident, said it was her first time to the Halloween party at the park. “I never knew they held a Halloween party here,” she said. “I saw it on the (Pixie Woods) Facebook page, and brought my son because he loves trains.” Her 2-year-old son donned a Scooby-Doo costume and rode the three-minute Pixie Woods Express around the park, which he thoroughly enjoyed, she said. Lodi resident Evelyn Rigg also saw the notice for the party on the park’s Facebook page and brought her two children and niece, who were waiting to ride the carousel. Her children, 1-year-old Isabella and 6-year-old Clarissa, were dressed as Anna from Disney’s Frozen and Cinderella, respectively. “This is our very first time to the park,” she said. “It’s just different and awesome compared to other parks.” Rigg said the themed restrooms for children were cute, and the playground — filed with giant slides and bridges, as well as pirate ships and Chinese dragons children could climb on, was something she had never seen at a children’s park before. Gae Stewart, the board’s secretary, said it was the board’s idea to host the party decades ago as a way to raise funds and keep Pixie Woods operational. “Their job is to raise money to support the park,” she said. “As a result we feature extra entertainment like this for the kids. And we do this just to celebrate.” The Halloween party is one of three special celebrations the board holds each year at Pixie Woods. A park birthday celebration is held in June, and a Christmas in July party is held the following month. — Contact reporter Wes Bowers at (209) 546-8258 or wbowers@recordnet.com.
