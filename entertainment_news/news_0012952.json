Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed the report but gave no further details. \nDer Spiegel said the exhibition could contain work that may have been taken by the Nazis from Jewish owners. It quoted Gruetters as saying that, while organizers must show \"respect for the victims,\" she hopes they find new clues on works' origins. \nA task force examining the provenance of artwork in the collection so far has determined that four pieces were looted by the Nazis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:28:45.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
