When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself... I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn't want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don't need. (I told you it wasn't relatable, don't hate me).\" She earned $54million last year, according to Forbes, so she's got a point.\nShe added: \"I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled.' That seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being 'difficult' or 'spoiled'.\"\nAs with all experiences, it's a learning curve, and she plans to approach things slightly differently next time she finds herself in the same position: \"I'm over trying to find the 'adorable' way to state my opinion and still be likable!\" F*ck that. I don't think I've ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It's just heard.\"\nVia LennyLetter.com\nMORE: Watch: Jennifer Lawrence stuffing as many marshmallows in her mouth as possible just because\nMORE: Watch: So Chris Pratt, Amy Schumer, Jennifer Lawrence and Aziz Ansari made a (very) short film\nMORE: Watch: Lena Dunham talks women's issues, believes in horoscopes and psychics", "external_links": ["http://www.lennyletter.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:47:43.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
