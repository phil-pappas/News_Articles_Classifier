Allred represents Judy Huth, who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him in the 1970s.

She says a California judge will decide in December if the testimony will be made public. \nLawyers for the 78-year-old Cosby say Huth's lawsuit is frivolous and that Huth's former attorney attempted to extort Cosby. \nCosby also faces two other cases: a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a suit filed Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her.
