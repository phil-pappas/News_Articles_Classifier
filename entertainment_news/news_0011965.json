Fun Fun Fun!!\" Bout to learn to drive some new/vintage shit! Fun Fun Fun!!A photo posted by Samuel L Jackson (@samuelljackson) on Oct 16, 2015 at 1:12pm PDT It looks similar to helicopters used during the Vietnam War - echoing rumours the film is partially set in the 1970s as previously mentioned by former cast member JK Simmons.That's an idea that Reel Local Hawaii appears to have picked up on too, considering this image of Jackson in the helicopter with crew:Are you ready!? I'm definitely getting a 1970's Vietnam vibe on this film. #Kong #SkullIsland #oahu #samueljackson pic.twitter.com/e5NJ7U4vH6— Reel Tours Hawaii (@reeltourshawaii) October 16, 2015 John Goodman was recently added to the film's cast, and will play a government official named Randa, responsible for leading the expedition to Skull Island.Kong: Skull Island will also star Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, and is due to open on March 10, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:20:38.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
