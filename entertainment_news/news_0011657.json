He liked it, but expressed his inability to take the film on at this point since his date diary is packed. The director, too, is in no hurry to take the film on floors and wants to concentrate on his upcoming co-production, 'Airlift'. So, till January, he won't work on anything else. However, he will restart the hunt for a lead actor for 'Bazaar'.\"\nAlso read:  Nikhil Advani's 'Bazaar' along the lines of 'Trishul' \nThere was strong buzz that Hrithik decided to pass up on 'Bazaar' after Nikhil delivered two back-to-back duds, 'Hero' and 'Katti Batti'. Both the filmmaker and the actor did not revert to this writer when asked about the buzz. However, a source close to Nikhil says, \"It has got more to do with Hrithik’s packed schedule. He is pretty selective and prefers to work on one project at a time. After Ashutosh Gowariker's 'Mohenjo Daro', he will work on Vijay Krishna Acharya's next and cannot commit himself to another project at the moment.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:07:23.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
