A 21-year-old model claims she dated Kourtney Kardashian’s troubled baby daddy Scott Disick for a month when he abruptly stopped calling her, right around the time of the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” midseason premiere in September.\nElite model Makayla Yarbrough, 21, met at Disick’s Beverly Hills house through a mutual friend on Aug. 15, and hung out by the pool and flirted. That sparked a monthlong hookup during which he never once mentioned Kourtney Kardashian, the mother of Disick’s three children, who broke up with the bad boy reality star in July.\n“(It was) a short brief month of hanging out. We went to Reno together, too,” Yarborough tells Confidenti@l exclusively. “We stayed together overnight at least four times . . . (He) never (mentioned the Kardashians) I never asked and he never said anything.”\nShe calls the 32-year-old Disick, who last week on the show was shown on his July “bender” with stylist Chloe Bartoli in France while Kourtney was in Calabasas, Calif ., caring for their three kids, “a young boy, not mature,” and “not a normal person.”\nDuring their brief fling, Yarbrough and Disick, who recently checked into rehab according to Us Weekly , stayed holed up at his bachelor pad, “chilling out” and throwing parties, until their final phone call on Sept. 27.\n“Honestly, it’s not uncommon for people in Hollywood (to party), but when he doesn’t eat or sleep, it’s obviously alarming,” she says, describing Disick’s unhealthy habits. “After two or three nights of partying, I’d eat everything in sight and he’d have soup.”\nShe goes on to describe his house, saying it’s expensive, but not cozy, with bare walls and disaster areas from the constant partying.\n“One day I went there and they had a party the day before it was the most disgusting thing I’d ever seen. Door handles were missing, toilets were broken, I wanted to leave and I did. Scott just accepted it and had the maid the clean it up,” she says.\nShe says Disick’s alleged drug use and drinking is being witnessed by the “random people” he invites over to his house. Disick’s penchant for partying with strangers has been documented by the paparazzi.\n“I don’t know what to make of it (the drug use). He seems in control of it. He has random girls, not even attractive girls over, they’re dirty and messy,” she says. “He was very private about his sex life . . . I definitely think he’s lonely. I don’t think he’s happy, I think he pretends.”\nSeason 11 of “Kardashians” will return to E! on Nov. 11. The premiere showed Disick crying to Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Kourtney, saying he has “no one” after the family shunned him for cheating on Kourtney.\nConfidential@nydailynews.com\nGot some hot gossip for us?\nTipline: 212-210-1616\nE-mail: confidential@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scott-disick-enters-rehab-for-drug-and-alcohol-addiction--20151410"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:13:01.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
