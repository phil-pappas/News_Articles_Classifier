This imaginary kingdom is ruled over by King Benedict and Queen Eleanor. Princess Aurora’s romantic interest is not a Prince, but the royal gamekeeper, Leo. Representing the central forces of good and evil are Count Lilac (the King of the Fairies) and the Dark Fairy Carabosse. Bourne has also created the character of Caradoc, the sinister but charming son of Carabosse. Princess Aurora’s Fairy Godparents are characterised by their names - Ardor, Hibernia, Autumnus, Feral and Tantrum. \nReturning to the central role of Aurora in this first revival is rising star Ashley Shaw. Ashley recently played Lana in the triumphant revival of The Car Man, and has also played Kim in Edward Scissorhands, Sugar in Nutcracker! and the title role in Cinderella. \nCordelia Braithwaite made her debut with New Adventures in Swan Lake in 2013 and has since featured in this years revival of The Car Man, covering the role of Lana. Cordelia makes her debut as Aurora this season; her first Principal role with New Adventures. Share article \nThe leading role of Leo will once again be played by Dominic North and Chris Trenfield who co-created the role in 2012. Dominic was most recently seen as Angelo in The Car Man. He was nominated as Outstanding Male Dancer at The National Dance Awards for his performance as Edward Scissorhands. Chris has this year been seen as Luca in The Car Man, as Tony in Play Without Words, the title role in Nutcracker! and The Swan/Stranger in Bourne’s Swan Lake. \nTickets for Sleeping Beauty, which runs from March 15 to 19, are available from 023 8071 1811 or visit mayflower.org.uk Promoted Stories Full cast for Mayflower's Sleeping Beauty revealed Sorry, an error occurred.
