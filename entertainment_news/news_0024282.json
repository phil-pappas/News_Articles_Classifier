Co-authored by MAGNA GLOBAL and the Center for Multicultural Science, this is considered the first study to examine media behaviors across three generational levels (first, second and third) for the US Latino population. \"The results of this study are paradigm shifting and will have big implications for how marketers effectively reach Latinos on television,\" said Dr. Jake Beniflah , Executive Director, the Center for Multicultural Science. \"Because the Latino population is changing, we need to adopt new TV audience measures. Our research showed that using generational level is an effective predictor of what TV programs US Latinos are watching.\" \nCorporations have been actively assessing their effectiveness at targeting the growing U.S. Latino population. The study suggests that understanding the nuances of the Latino population goes beyond language and requires a broader cultural understanding. Using generational level to understand the cultural impact on media behavior is key to effectively and efficiently market to Latinos. \nStudy highlights: \nUnivision and Telemundo rank #1 and #2 in most watched TV networks among first-gen Hispanics. Univision ranks #5 in most watched TV networks among second-gen Hispanics. For third-gen Hispanics, the top five most watched TV networks are in English. As years-in-country increase, the percentage of first-gen Latinos watching English-language TV networks increased by as much as 20â€“30 percentage points. \"This study showed that using generational level and years-in-country can help marketers pinpoint which type of media outlet will reach a specific Latino audience most effectively,\" said Brian Hughes , SVP, Audience Measurement Lead at MAGNA GLOBAL. \"We believe changing times require changing measures.\"\nAbout \nThe Center for Multicultural Science is a leading non-profit, non-partisan think tank dedicated to bridge the gap between corporations and academia in cultural marketing research.
