However, the Malayalam audience, who had always appreciated voluptuous and curvy beauties on screen, have now taken to the Western ideals of slim and slender women and are increasingly resorting to fat-shaming. While many of the obvious instances, like the jibe the internet trolls took at Nazriya Nazim’s post-marriage photos, are obvious, the subtle fat-shaming messages that sneak into our everyday conversations often go unnoticed by everyone. Actress Kaniha, who was recently at the receiving end of such an incident, however, chose to react by posting about it on her Facebook page. “What gives somebody the right to come up to me and tell me ‘Oh my God, you are so skinny. But on screen you look fat’? Is it because I’m a celebrity that people assume I’m answerable to them, I begin to wonder. But no... there are so many women who are victims of fat-shaming at various levels... at work, at their own homes by their extended relatives, at their gyms, at get-togethers.. the place really doesn’t matter... Do these people realise women go through so many biological and hormonal changes and are bound to gain and lose weight? To my surprise and shock, most of the times it is women who indulge in fat-shaming,” posted the miffed actress. She added, “Does that somebody who had the audacity to comment on me being fat/slim know that I’ve just gone through a trauma of losing a baby after being 5 months pregnant and my body is struggling to get back to normalcy? Next time you comment about someone being thin or fat, please think twice because they could be battling something more important than just losing those few extra kilos.” Hope the message sinks in. entertainment Mollywood Kaniha Facebook Also Read 'Kick' was my final chance: Jacqueline Fernandez Akshay Kumar to produce daily soap 'Jamai Raja' 'Singh is Bling' has nothing to do with 'Singh is Kinng' Salman Khan is eager to watch PeeCee’s ‘Quantico’", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/CUTOUT3.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/CUTOUT3.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/entertainment-mollywood/article/fat-shaming-irks-kaniha", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:19:08.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
