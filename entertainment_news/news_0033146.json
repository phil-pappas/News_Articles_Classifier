The films are shown at 7 p.m. in the first-floor Abbott Room of the library, 106 High St., free and open to the public. \nThe October film series conclude Oct. 30 with “My Life Without Me” (2003, Spain/Canada), a sensitive and human story of a 23-year-old woman who learns she has inoperable cancer that will soon end her life. Although Ann decides not to tell her family the truth, she makes a list of priorities and goes about changing her life and that of her family for the better. Canadians Isabel Coixet (director) and Sarah Polley (Ann), along with American actor Mark Ruffalo, deliver an important narrative via an absorbing screenplay, based on a book by Nanci Kincaid. \nFor information on the Friday series’ schedule and films, call the library at 338-3884. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
