In their bid to end the molestation case, Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, argued that Huth's civil lawsuit violated a California code since it mentioned the comedian's name instead of referring to him as John Doe until a judge could review its merit. Cosby's team claimed the lawsuit filed in December 2014 had caused the comedian harm and led him to defend himself against numerous allegations that came afterwards. \"This was the linchpin that triggered everything going forward,\" Singer reasoned. Huth was previously represented by Marc Strecker. Now Gloria Allred serves as her lawyer. Besides making procedural violations, Huth's former attorney was accused of attempting to extort $250,000 from Cosby and sell her story to the National Enquirer. While Cosby and his team lost in their attempt to throw out the lawsuit, they gained a bit of victory as Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig D. Karlan agreed to seal Cosby's deposition for 60 days. \"It seems to me, to be the most reasonable way to approach this because I have no idea what's going to happen at this deposition,\" the judge said in a separate decision. Huth's lawsuit is one of the three filed against Bill Cosby since last year. Another suit is a defamation case while the third one was recently filed by model Chloe Goins who claimed the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:11.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
