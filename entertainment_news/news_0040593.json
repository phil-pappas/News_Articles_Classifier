Photo: Network Ten \nThe relationship we share with our favourite television characters is an intimate one: we let them into our living rooms, and, often they let us into theirs.\nBut, there are some television shows in which the characters' home is more than just a set, it's a character of itself. A place where some of the show's biggest revelations, or most touching moments, took place.\nAlthough you might not remember the exact street address, they're the sort of places you can find without using your GPS. Here are 10 of the most memorable residences on the box.\nRamsay Street, where Helen and Karl Kennedy have starred in Neighbours. Photo: Pat Scala \n742 Evergreen Terrace ( The Simpsons )  Its paint colour may have shifted from light pink to a slightly more brown hue, but the Simpson family home has remained as a constant fixture throughout the show's 26 seasons. Despite its dilapidated appearance, the Simpsons' four-bedroom abode is surprisingly structurally sound: when a hurricane passed through the town of Springfield, 742 remained standing while 744 (the house of the Simpsons' do-gooder neighbour Ned Flanders) was completely destroyed.\nAdvertisement Wisteria Lane ( Desperate Housewives ) The suburban cul-de-sac in which the middle-class ladies of the Desperate Housewives cast lived, lunched, and looked at pool boys came to be as well known as the show itself. Interestingly, the street we know as Wisteria Lane is actually a set inside Hollywood's Universal Studios called Colonial Street, and has been used in productions ranging from Gremlins and Buffy the Vampire Slayer , to the film clip for Smash Mouth's All Star .\nApartment 5A, 129 West 81st Street ( Seinfeld )  Jerry Seinfeld's apartment on New York's Upper West Side, with its purple walls and sky blue couches, was the place where ... nothing much happened. The apartment was recreated for five days as part of a Seinfeld exhibit in June, giving fans the chance to hang out in apartment 5A.\nThe cast of Desperate Housewives in Wisteria Lane.

The actual San Fran house used for the show's exterior shots last sold in 2006 for $US1.85 million ($2.57 million) although it is estimated that its value has nearly tripled since then.\n508 Saint Cloud Road ( The Fresh Prince of Bel Air )  Every prince needs his castle and for Philadelphia-born Will Smith (played by, you guessed it, Will Smith) 508 Saint Cloud Road was where he came to sit on his throne as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Although there is indeed an insanely large Bel Air mansion sitting at 508 Saint Cloud Road it is, alas, not the Roman-columned palace that was occupied by the Banks family.\n7 Gordon Street ( The Sullivans ) \nThe Sullivans outside 7 Gordon Street. Photo: Supplied \nThe Sullivans' weatherboard villa in Melbourne's Camberwell was actually a house located three kilometres away in the suburb of Canterbury. The house – where Dave and Grace raised their three children through WWII – is no longer standing, having been replaced by townhouses.\n4222 Clinton Way ( The Brady Bunch ) \nThe family of a man named Brady and a lovely lady lived at 4222 Clinton Way. The house – which is a real house in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley – was reportedly chosen as the residence of the eight Bradys and their housekeeper, Alice, because series creator Sherwood Schwartz thought it looked like the kind of house where an architect would live.\nThe Flintstone family, residents of 342 Gravelpit Terrace. Photo: Supplied \n342 Gravelpit Terrace ( The Flintstones ) \nFred Flintstone and his wife Wilma live next to Barney and Betty Rubble on Gravelpit Terrace, in a one-storey abode with a large, grassy garden surrounded by palm trees. No word on how the grass stays that green in the middle of the desert.\n245 East 73rd Street ( Sex and the City ) \nCarrie Bradshaw's Manhattan red brick is why you should never believe what you see on TV. Comparable one-bedroom, shabby chic apartments in NYC (between Park and Madison avenues, no less) rent for about $US3500 ($4860) a month. For someone who seems to just write one romance column a week, that's a lot of dollars. Was she managing hedge funds on the side?\n28 Ramsay Street ( Neighbours ) \nOriginally owned by Des Clarke, in 1994 Helen and Karl Kennedy moved into No. 28 on Australian TV's most famous street, and they have been there ever since. While the house has seen various residents come and go – the Kennedy's three kids, a foreign exchange student, as well as literally anyone within a one kilometre radius going through some sort of relationship trauma – Helen and Karl seem unlikely to leave any time soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:19.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
