It's a wonderful time of innocence, and overcoming and exceeding expectations and bursting on the national scene.\n\"These guys care so much about each other. Maybe it will get more complicated as time goes by, but I don't think it will get any less special. These guys care about each other.\"\nAnd never did their unselfishness blend so well on a national stage as it did Tuesday as the club took a major step toward confirming its status as World Series contenders.\nThanks to homers from Baez and Schwarber and seven relievers combining for six innings of two-run ball, the Cubs thumped the perennial power Cardinals 6-4 to win their best-of-five National League Division Series 3-1.\nIn advancing to the NL Championship Series that starts Saturday in either New York or Los Angeles, the third-place Cubs beat the second-place Pirates in the wild-card game before beating a 100-win Cardinals team that won its third consecutive NL Central title to earn its fifth consecutive playoff berth.\n\"They're the team to beat,\" 22-game winner Jake Arrieta said. \"They have been for the last however many years. To go through the Pirates in the wild-card game and now the Cardinals, we feel like we can beat anybody. We're a tough team to play, no matter who it is.\"\nThe confidence has swelled with reinforcements. Baez, 22, who didn't make the opening day roster and then was on a bereavement leave for a month at Triple-A Iowa after the death of his sister (Noely), took over for the injured Addison Russell at shortstop Tuesday and ripped a three-run, opposite-field homer off John Lackey in the second.\n\"It has been a tough year for me and my family, and you play through it, keep going and make adjustments,\" Baez said. \"(Joely) is always with me, and I'm always with her.\"\nAnthony Rizzo, who predicted in January that the Cubs would win the NL Central, hit a tie-breaking home run in the sixth, and rookie Kyle Schwarber smacked a homer that struck the top of the right field videoboard in the seventh.\n\"We're so young and reckless that we're just having a good time,\" Rizzo said. \"And being able to play in Pittsburgh in that atmosphere in the wild-card game, I'll never hear a city louder than that. That really helped us going to St. Louis. This is the loudest I've heard (Wrigley Field).\n\"(Cubs fans) deserve this. Everyone should enjoy this (Wednesday) and be hurting a bit at work.\"\nThe fact that the Cubs clinched a postseason series for the first time in the 101-year history of Wrigley Field wasn't lost on Rizzo, who resurrected the spirit of Hall of Famers Ron Santo and Ernie Banks.\n\"They left this uniform in a better position, and that's what we want to do,\" Rizzo said. \"Look at this weather in October with the wind blowing out. It hasn't blown out all year.\n\"If that doesn't have something to do with Ernie Banks, I don't know what does. He would be very proud of this team. Billy Williams said it best, that this team is going to win in 2015 as a team. So we have to keep it going.\"\nMeanwhile, late-season additions Fernando Rodney and Clayton Richard earned key outs that led up to a wild on-field celebration.\n\"We've been a part of a lot of history this year, so why not continue to write it?\" Arrieta said.\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Copyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Anthony Rizzo Javier Baez Wrigley Field Kyle Schwarber St. Louis Cardinals", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dca29/turbine/ct-cubs-win-nlds-report-cardinals-spt-1014-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:36:26.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
