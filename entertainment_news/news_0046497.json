But Tyson said offered a disclaimer:\nPlay Video CBS Evening News NASA applauds Hollywood's \"The Martian\" The upcoming film \"The Martian\" stars Matt Damon as an astronaut living on Mars. The depiction of life on the Red Planet is drawing praise from N...\n\"You might think it's because he is physically fit, but if it's a 200-pound tank, it weighs 80 pounds on Mars.\"\nThese little things add authenticity, Tyson said, but he added that the film is not entirely without inaccuracies.\nFor instance, the deadly sandstorm that strands Damon on Mars would hardly be as terrifying in reality, according to Tyson.\nPlay Video CBSN Neil DeGrasse Tyson on the possibility of life on Mars The discovery of flowing water on Mars reignites questions about life on the Red Planet.

The possibility of survival...\nTyson expressed excitement over NASA's announcement just days before the film's release of the discovery of flowing water on Mars . He said this would decrease Mars mission costs as NASA continues to \"follow the water\" in search of life.\n\"Even as an astrophysicist, I consider the search for life in the universe to be one of the greatest and highest goals in all branches of science,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/02/43a3c4d7-e761-46b7-a11a-368376cf2e15/thumbnail/220x140/2ec2d39dbe92d6527ff24176e246ea99/en0902axelrodmartian-1439777640x360.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/b1945ea3-a679-4f8e-b212-d4be8164ffa2/thumbnail/220x140/a92a692de0792ab207b04e88aa65a1bd/ctmmartian0929449669640x360.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/05/610135a6-1cf2-4557-87f2-dbb56509ed13/thumbnail/220x140/560cc83476feecc6fc647c11cab73c20/cbsnmars1005451568640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:22:33.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
