The quarterback and cornerback have gone from rivals to teammates back to rivals, with Revis helping Brady and the New England Patriots win Super Bowl XLIX last year before rejoining the New York Jets in the offseason. On Sunday, they will re-establish their dynamic as opponents when the Patriots host the Jets.\nAfter years of tussles in the AFC East and in practice together, the relationship between Brady and Revis is one of mutual respect.\n\"There was a lot of competition in practice last year with him, and he makes it tough,'' Brady said, according to the Boston Globe . \"His instincts are incredible out there. He's one of those guys who sees everything on the field. He sees the formations and routes and splits and anything pre-snap that can help him get an idea of whether the ball is coming his way or if it's going the other [way] or if it's a run or pass or deep throw or short throw.''\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 7 NFL picks\nBrady enters the game as the architect of the league's top offense and the frontrunner for league MVP. An interception off a bobbled pass last week against the Indianapolis Colts is the lone blemish in a season in which he has completed 70.6% of his passes and thrown 14 touchdowns.\nRevis, meanwhile, has helped make the Jets the top-ranked defense in the league. And though the defensive line is also to credit, it's Revis' ability to generate turnovers (three interceptions in five games) and lock down opposing receivers that make New York the biggest threat to New England thus far.\nShadowing the opposing team's top receiver is nothing new for Revis, who could draw the task of shutting down Julian Edelman. Though Rob Gronkowski grabs most of the attention and big plays, Edelman has been targeted 10 or more times in all but one game so far this year.\nBut how willing is Brady to test Revis? If and when he does, the plays could be a turning point in the game.\nHere are four other matchups that will define NFL Week 7:\nMatt Cassel will have to take chances against the Giants. (Photo: Brandon Wade, AP)\nDallas Cowboys QB Matt Cassel vs. New York Giants secondary\nPersonnel aside, the Cowboys couldn't have put Cassel in a much better situation to take over as starting quarterback.\nCassel won't have Dez Bryant back in his Dallas debut, but he has had the bye week to prepare for one of the NFL's worst pass defenses in the Giants. Now it's up to the veteran signal-caller to give the offense the downfield passing element Brandon Weeden couldn't provide.\nThe Cowboys will have to open up their attack, but Cassel won't have to carry the group. Yet if ever there were a time to gamble on the passing game, this is it.\nCornerback Prince Amukamara is out again with a pectoral strain, leaving New York's already thinned secondary even more vulnerable. Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley should find opportunities on the outside — if Cassel can get them the ball.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 7 fantasy football rankings\nOakland Raiders DE Khalil Mack vs. San Diego Chargers offensive line\nPhilip Rivers might be the last quarterback the Raiders want to face right now.\nThe Chargers signal-caller is coming off a 503-yard outing against the Green Bay Packers in a losing effort. If Rivers fares similarly on Sunday, there's little question he'll come out on top this time.\nIt might be up to Mack to keep things together for the Raiders pass defense, tied for last in the league with 299 yards allowed per game. The second-year edge rusher has emerged as Pro Bowl-level talent. If he can generate the pressure he applied to Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos last week, the Raiders can mask some of their shortcomings in the secondary.\nSan Diego's line ranks third-worst in pressures allowed, according to Pro Football Focus, and has been one of the limiting factors for Rivers this season. Left tackle King Dunlap and left guard Orlando Franklin could return after missing the last three games, but six potential Chargers offensive starters are listed as questionable.\nUSA TODAY\nNFL Junkies Podcast: Should Pittsburgh sit Big Ben in Week 7?\nCarolina Panthers TE Greg Olsen vs. Philadelphia Eagles S Malcolm Jenkins\nCam Newton is doing all he can with a ragtag group of receivers. But Olsen is stepping up for the quarterback in a time of need.\nOlsen has a modest 24 catches and 374 yards this season, but he accounts for more than a third of the team's passing yards on the year. In last week's win over the Seattle Seahawks, he had as many catches (seven) as all of the wide receivers combined.\nThe Eagles have fared well against tight ends, with only the Cowboys' Jason Witten breaking the 50-yard barrier in a game. Defensive coordinator Bill Davis' scheme deserves credit for that accomplishment, but so does Jenkins.\nWhile cornerback play has been shaky in Philadelphia, Jenkins and Walter Thurmond have been stabilizing presences in the secondary. Jenkins should have help from Thurmond, linebacker Jordan Hicks and others against Olsen. But the matchup could be key in keeping Newton and Carolina off the field.\nUSA TODAY\nPelissero: Ryan Fitzpatrick can take Jets on long flight\nNew Orleans Saints DE Cameron Jordan vs. Indianapolis Colts offensive line\nIndianapolis' first step toward providing Andrew Luck proper protection might come Sunday against Jordan.\nThe Saints defensive lineman has reaffirmed his standing as a top pass rusher this season. He was a force against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 6, recording three sacks and a forced fumble.\nDefensive coordinator Rob Ryan has shifted Jordan around on the line, and he should continue to experiment against the Colts. Jordan could be a big threat on the interior, where the Colts have struggled to hold their ground.\nLuck needs to have a quick trigger against Jordan and the Saints' rush, but he should find big opportunities if he can get the ball out. New Orleans will be without injured cornerbacks Keenan Lewis and Damian Swann on its 24th-ranked pass defense.\nPHOTOS: Week 7 games ranked by watchability\n14.
