He is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid.\nIt was not immediately clear why the arrest warrants were issued, but Quaid recently said they were related to a longstanding dispute over a property in Santa Barbara. Quaid and his wife were arrested in California in 2010 on suspicion of burglary and entering a building without consent.\nQuaid said the building was their own home and that after a failed attempt to sell it, they still owned the property.\nAn attorney representing Quaid could not be reached for immediate comment.\n(Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; editing by David Alexander )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:10:01.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
