These may well include knives (more knife related murders than guns to my knowledge), bricks, cars, pangas, spears, axes, etc.\nThe fact of the matter is that any lethal weapon used to perpetrate crime is a tool used to ensure a higher success rate for the criminal and in itself the tool should not be blamed. Limiting access to the tools is all good, but how is that to be implemented / enforced? Asking gun owners or criminals to hand in their firearms under amnesty conditions is ridiculous in my opinion as criminals will never hand in theirs.\nIn fact I would suggest that action would skew the ratio and make the use of lethal weapons in perpetrating crime even more effective, never mind taking away from law abiding citizens that could use those same legal tools to defend themselves. (This has in fact happened before - look at Australia, their gun ban and the results. They are now calling for more lenient gun laws... again).\nLethal weapons do not cause crime, they enable it to be more successful. Do not take our ability to defend ourselves away by putting us in the same bucket as criminalsâ€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:10:51.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
