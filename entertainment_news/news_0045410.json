(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\nAttorneys for Tyler sent a second cease-and-desist letter to Trump’s campaign committee on Saturday.\nIn this Friday, Nov. 14, 2014, file photo, Steven Tyler arrives at the Hollywood Film Awards at the Palladium, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)\nThe letter says that Trump does “not have our client’s permission to use ‘Dream On’” or any of Tyler’s other songs and that it “gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump’s presidential bid.”\nTyler, who is a registered Republican, attended the GOP contenders’ first debate in August.\nAttorney Dina LaPolt said in a statement that the letter is not a “political” or “personal issue with Mr. Trump,” but it’s one of permission and copyright.\nRepresentatives for Trump did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nTrump has received warnings from other artists for using songs on the campaign trail, including Neil Young (“Rockin’ in the Free World”) and R.E.M. (“It’s the End of the World as We Know It [And I Feel Fine]“).\n—\nFollow Dave Urbanski ( @DaveVUrbanski ) on Twitter\nOther Must-Read Stories <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DaveVUrbanski", "http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29802121&freewheel=90119&sitesection=theblaze&height=364&width=645"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:49:15.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
