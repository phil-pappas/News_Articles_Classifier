Fatigue is defined as extreme tiredness. It’s different from sleepiness, which is described as difficulty staying awake, frequent yawning, and feeling like you need to lie down and rest. Fatigue also is different from lack of interest or enjoyment in activities, which may be a sign of depression but sometimes overlaps with fatigue. Your doctor can help address fatigue, tiredness and depression. While it is important to see your doctor regularly, here are ways to tackle five common energy-sapping culprits:\n1. Don’t bilk your bed time: The old adage tells us that eight hours of sleep rounds out a perfect day. In fact, healthy adults can require anywhere from six to 10 hours of sleep a night. Do you clock enough bed time? If you rise at 6 a.m. and do well with eight hours of sleep, you should in bed with the lights off by 9:30, giving yourself a full 30 minutes to fall asleep.\n2. Identify the interruptions: Waking during the night can sap your energy during the day. What’s waking you up? If it’s environmental—for example, humming traffic or noisy neighbors—consider sleeping with a fan or a white-noise machine. DO NOT SLEEP WITH THE TV ON. TV sound varies between programming and commercials and that will disrupt your sleep even if you aren’t aware of it. If you’re waking up to urinate, avoid fluids two to three hours before bedtime. If it persists, talk to your doctor about it as it can signal an underlying health issue.\n3. Step up your exercise: While it may seem like a contradiction, you can be tired because you don’t get enough exercise. Studies show a correlation between getting the recommended 150 minutes of exercise a week and decreased daytime sleepiness, as well as improved concentration when tired.\n4. Find foods that fuel you: Poor nutrition can leave you sluggish. Foods with simple, quickly digested carbohydrates that rapidly increase blood sugar change your body’s metabolic balance. As your blood sugar drops, you’ll feel tired and will crave more carbs/sugar for energy. Instead, choose whole gains and natural fiber balanced with protein. You’ll keep your blood sugar stable, feel fuller longer and you won’t feel tired between meals.\n5. Tame your tension: It’s important to consider the emotional aspects of fatigue. Feeling on edge or stressed, having a lot on your mind, or constantly thinking of things you need to do can make you feel physically tired. Take time every day to do something you enjoy, even if it’s only for a few minutes. And make time to stay connected with family and loved ones who are a source of positive support. If you are struggling with managing stress or too much anxiety, make an appointment to see your doctor.\nLaura E.
