(Scott Garfield/AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nNetflix is planning a return trip to Stars Hollow. \nThe digital channel is developing a revival of the much-loved Warner Bros. series \"Gilmore Girls\" with creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, exec producer Daniel Palladino. The project would be four 90-minute movies, rather than a series, Variety has learned. Warner Bros. and Netflix both declined to comment. \nSet in the small, fictional town of Stars Hollow, Ct., the original series starred Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as fast-talking, pop-culture loving mother-daughter duo Lorelei and Rory Gilmore. It ran for seven seasons, starting out on the WB and then moving to the CW after the 2006 merger. Other actors appearing over the course of the run include Melissa McCarthy, Scott Patterson, Kelly Bishop, Edward Herrmann, Jared Padalecki, Sean Gunn, Milo Ventimiglia, Matt Czuchry and Chad Michael Murray. \nRumors of a revival have long been in the works, with Sherman-Palladino telling fans at last summer's ATX festival \"there's nothing in the works at the moment.\" \n\"If it ever happened, I promise we'd do it correctly. ... Nobody here hates each other, which is very important,\" she said. \"It would have to be the right everything, the right format, the right timing. It would have to be honored in a certain way. And if it ever came around, we would all jump in and do it.\" \nThis project was announced on the same day that news broke of Graham working with her other famous TV show daughter, \"Parenthood's\" Mae Whitman, on an adaptation of \"Go Fug Yourself\" bloggers Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan's book, \"The Royal We.\" \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:54:08.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
