DONALD RICHMOND Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 6:34 PM » Social News Shared meals encourage shared lives. Having just returned from having lunch with friends, I am reminded of how food and fellowship go together. Sitting, sharing and savoring has the capacity to create an atmosphere that opens hearts and minds. Jesus understood this, and so must we. As we continue with our reflection upon Acts 2: 42, the context and content of Christian formation and growth, we come upon two other “essentials.” Growth in God is not just dependent upon being obedient to “Apostolic Teaching,” as crucial as this is, but also upon “breaking bread” and “fellowship.” Those people who assert “Christ without Christianity” and “Relationship without Religion” must be able to biblically and practically be able to articulate how they can “break bread” and “fellowship” without embracing Christianity, Church and true fellowship. It cannot be done, except superficially. When the early Church “broke bread” within the context of “fellowship” they embraced at least three priorities. These priorities governed and guided their growth in God. These priorities and practices formed them. Each priority governs and guides our growth in God, as well. To neglect any one of these negates growth. Breaking Bread in the early Christian community included shared meals, shared sacraments and shared lives. These, while often involving ritual, were intended to enhance and empower relationships. Life in Christ requires sharing our lives with others. A “saved” life is a shared life. When Paul the Apostle referenced the “Last Supper” he insisted upon reconciliation. Participation in the ritual was predicated upon peace in our relationships. If a person wanted to participate in Holy Communion they had to seek communion with other people; other members of the church community being crucial to this. Paul’s insistence upon self-examination simply echoed the words of Jesus Christ when our Lord said “first be reconciled.” What this means, especially as we think about how growth is encouraged, is that reconciliation with other people (as far as is safe and reasonable) promotes our relationship with God. John, the “beloved disciple,” said this: “You cannot love God who you do not see, if you do not love your neighbor who you do see.” Communion with and in Christ requires communion with others. Life in Christ requires shared Sacraments. What is a “sacrament?” A sacrament is simply a physical means of communicating or actualizing a spiritual grace. The application of physical water in Baptism communicates and actualizes the spiritual “cleansing” we receive when we accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Similarly, the Bread and Wine that we eat and drink becomes the spiritual nourishment we need as we continue upon our earthly pilgrimage through life. As with the children of Israel during their wilderness wanderings, we too, in this Holy Communion, receive supernatural “manna” from heaven. And, as Jesus said most pointedly in John 6, “unless you eat…and drink…you have no life in you.” Life in Christ requires shared meals. There were, in my understanding, two meals enjoyed by Christians in the early Church: Ritual Meal (Holy Communion) and Relational Meal. Frequently, apart from Holy Communion, the Church would gather to have a “Love Feast.” Today, although lacking the considerable substance that the primitive Church enjoyed, this “Love Feast” might be called the “Church Supper” or the “Potluck.” The Church, with invited guests, shares a meal. We gather to break bread and fellowship. Jesus did this with his disciples, and the early church prioritized our Lord’s example. Shared meals enhance shared lives. But, as with us, the ancient Church also had its problems. Paul pointed out that some people got drunk, some people ate too much and some people ignored the physical needs of others during these so-called “Love Feasts.” Paul, as Christ’s representative, said that this behavior was morally wrong and socially reprehensible. To put it far more bluntly, Paul said that such behavior was hypocritical. In other words, he asserted that participation in Christian Sacraments required caring for the needs of others. To be a Christian did not just involve a having a relationship with Jesus, it required participating in a common life with other people. Sacrament had social requirements. Worship had a “world” perspective. Feeding ourselves implied feeding others. Christianity, as Acts 2 bluntly states, involves commonality. It involves community. Growing in God is the natural inclination of every TRUE Christian. Such growth is not, so to speak, “other-worldly.” Christian faith is a functional faith that sees, celebrates and supports others. If your faith is simply “Jesus and me,” it is likely that you have no faith at all. Devotional practices involve relational practices. The Rev. Dr. Donald P.
