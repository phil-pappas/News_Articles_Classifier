Is he crazy or does he have these powers?\" Hawley told TV Insider.\"The answer is, kind of both. I'm a big believer that the structure of a story should reflect the content of the story. And so I liked the idea that if you have a character that doesn't know what's real and what's not real, that is also the audience's journey.\"Hawley doesn't have a big background in comics, but expressed his excitement over the series and said that X-Men's Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg were helping to guide him.\"I read a lot of X-Men growing up, but it's not something that was my life-long dream to do something like this. © Fox \"But what's nice is I just started the process, not even based on any of the characters from the universe, but I just started thinking about that world and if there is an interesting show to play around that idea of mutant-outsider identity. \"The thing about the X-Men franchise that's so unique is it's a movie that starts in a concentration camp. And so you know that it's actually concerned with real-world morality and evil. It also has these diametrically opposed points of view that are both right.\"The creator also said that Legion would have its own standalone universe, as opposed to tying in with the X-Men films, and said that a crossover with another new X-Men series, Hellfire, was unlikely.The new series of Fargo premieres tonight on Channel 4 at 10pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:34:42.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
