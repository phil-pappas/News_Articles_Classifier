The comic actor will not be appearing as himself for he is cast as one of the apes. Storyline is being kept under wraps but some of the characters have been revealed. Harrelson is a villain referred to as the Colonel. Chavarria is playing a human character whose part is reportedly only a small one. It is yet revealed whether Andy Serkis will be back playing Caesar whose story continues in this installment. Matt Reeves, who directed 2014's \" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes \", is returning to helm the upcoming 20th Century Fox film. Script is written once again by Mark Bomback and shooting will begin this fall in Vancouver for a July 14, 2017 theatrical release. Motion capture technology will be used to realize Zahn's performance. Serkis used the same technology to portray Caesar in two previous installments of the franchise. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More War of the Planet of the Apes News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:12:03.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
