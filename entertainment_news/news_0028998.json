There’s a handful of people taking a chance to beat the street and educate the public.”\nDovetail (www.dovetail sake.com) is one of about only a dozen sake makers in the United States and the first in Massachusetts.\n“Todd is passionate and he’s going to knock it out of the park,” said Suzanne Schalow, the founder of Belmont-based national retail franchise Craft Beer Cellar. “The first sake and Japanese-only beer shop opened eight months ago in California. This is officially a ‘thing.’”\nBellomy will pour samples of Dovetail’s flagship Nakahama Junmai at the festival. He describes it as a “very modern sake, aromatic and complex and highly filtered.” He filtered and racked the sake just yesterday.\nBellomy intends to release bottles of Nakahama Junmai to the public by Thanks­giving. Dovetail will also offer a second product, Omori Nigori, which Bellomy describes as “an unfiltered, cloudy, hand-pressed sake. It’s less complex than Nokahama, more sweet, round and fun.”\nEducating consumers, bar owners and restaurateurs about a product widely misunderstood in America looms as Dovetail’s greatest challenge.\nSake is not distilled, so it’s not a spirit. And while it’s often called rice wine, sake is more akin to beer because it’s made from fermented grain — rice — and not fruit. Grains used to make beer are malted to help convert starches into fermentable sugars. In the case of sake, a fungus called koji helps break down rice starches into sugars. Consumers often liken sake to wine, though, because of its small servings and higher alcohol content.\nQuality sake is also best served cold, not warm or hot.\n“There is so much depth and complexity to grain-based beverages that you drive off the aromatic compounds when you heat it up,” said Bellomy. Sake was often fortified with added alcohol during the rice shortage in Japan after World War II. Warming it helped mask the foul flavors of cheap sake.\n“Education, for us, will be the whole game,” said Bellomy.\nWZLX Craft Beer Experience, the Cyclorama at the Boston Center for the Arts, 539 Tremont St.; tomorrow 6 to 9 p.m., Saturday 2 to 5 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m.; $45 in advance, $50 at the door; www.wzlx.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:42:44.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
