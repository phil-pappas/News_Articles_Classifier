As a preschool girl with autism, Julia does things a little differently and helps give viewers a new perspective. This major initiative was created in an attempt to help decrease the stigma connected to autism.\nJulia has not made it to television just yet, but is a main character in Sesame Street's online storybook called \" We're Amazing, 1,2,3 \". This digital storybook gives readers the option to have the story read to them or mute the sound and read for themselves. With vibrant illustrations, the story introduces Julia as a friend to Elmo and Abby who plays in her own way. The story really gives children an idea of different ways a child with autism might play.\nSesame Street has been working with organizations like Autism Speaks and Autism Self Advocacy to bring forth awareness. This nation wide initiative, Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children , was created to encourage celebrating the uniqueness of each and every child. On October 20, 2015 Sesame Street uploaded a YouTube video introducing the Sesame Street and Autism Campaign. In this video Abby Cadabby explains to viewers that many children have autism and it just means their brain works differently.\nAlthough Julia hasn't been introduced on the TV show as of yet, she will continue to help encourage acceptance and uniqueness through Sesame Street's online storybook.", "external_links": ["http://autism.sesamestreet.org/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwtaexBRCohZOAoOPL88oBEiQAr96eSP-5REMZLD9h7s_K0QLuGbvoubyOAlbUcDhIbUUENAQaAmIk8P8HAQ", "http://autism.sesamestreet.org/storybook-we-are-amazing", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuV8AddbXIs", "http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-releases/sesame-street-launches-major-autism-initiative"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:50:45.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
