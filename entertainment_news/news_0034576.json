But also attendance at so many of the free events has also been very high; you've got to, I believe, look at both together.There's just been terrific engagement by the public with our program.\"\nThe festival celebrated its 30th anniversary across 17 days and almost 80 events, more than half of which were free. The average ticket price was around $46 this year, part of Ridge's desire for the annual event to be as inclusive as possible.\nDuring the three years she's been at the helm, Ridge has also noticed the rise of social media have a positive effect, replacing what would once have been word-of-mouth hype.\n\"In the old days you might get home and ring your best friend the next morning to say don't miss this – now, of course, you leave the theatre and tweet or put something on Facebook and then it gets retweeted and ... out it goes,\" she said. \"It's instant and it's broad.\"\nIn her three years at the festival's helm, Ridge has initiated international co-commissions (Hofesh Shechter's Sun and Fabulous Beast Dance Theatre's The Rite of Spring / Petrushka ), local-international co-commissions (including Circa's Opus, Complexity of Belonging with MTC and Chunky Move) and also supported the independent theatre sector, working with Theatre Works, The Rabble and St Martin's.\nShe also established Tanderrum, the festival's opening ceremony which brings together elders from the five clans of the Eastern Kulin, the initiative of which she is perhaps most proud.\n\"Introducing Tanderrum as the opening of the festival was an extraordinary thing; it's incredibly important, having worked with the elders and I love the way the community has really taken to it,\" she said. \"It has significance way beyond the festival, real cultural significance. I'm very proud of it.\"\nShe said incoming director Jonathan Holloway is \"keen to maintain the close connection with\" the Aboriginal community\" but she couldn't confirm in what ways it might develop next year.\nRidge was also unable to confirm what her next role in the arts would be.\n\"My real plan is to take a break and just stand back a bit and contemplate where the next opportunity might lie. I've deliberately kept it open as possible,\" she says. And while her three-year stint as artistic director went by fast, she says she's very happy with her tenure.\n\"There's a real sense of completion; I was invited to direct three festivals and I came in with that arc in the way I approached it – and I do feel that the arc has been accomplished.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:19:46.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
