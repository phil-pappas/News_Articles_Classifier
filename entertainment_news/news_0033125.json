There's no two ways of dressing it up; last year's red carpet was a rather muted affair...\nTo be perfectly honest, it didn't exactly set the world alight. If fact, it barely fizzled - largely due to the lack to stars on display. The preferred colour of choice was black, which didn't help matters much. Laura Whitmore did try to add a bit of oomph to proceedings by standing like this, and by wearing the entire contents of a kohl mine around her eyes, which was appreciated.\nOther notables on the night include Ariana Grande (because she's one of the only current names to show), Nicki Minaj (she had to turn up given she was hosting the thing), good ole reliable Ed Sheeran, model Jourdan Dunn, and someone claiming to be Emile Sande.\nAnd now to the highlight of the night... The Hoff in a kilt. Rocking half a tonne of concealer... What a pro.\nOne of the most notable looks of the night came from Skylar Grey.
