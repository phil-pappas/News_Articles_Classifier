He guards his work and specially 'Bajirao Mastani', which is a film he wanted to make for the last 15 years. And when it has finally happened, he is keeping all the work under wraps. The rest of the energy of the film will unfold gradually,\" Deepika said.\nThe film, slated to release on December 18, brings forward a love story of a warrior princess - Mastani, who was the second wife Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I (played by Ranveer Singh).\nThere is a love triangle as well with actress Priyanka Chopra essaying the role of Bajirao's first wife, Kashibai.\nDeepika asserts that the off-screen chemistry of the film's cast is nothing compared to the onscreen vibe.\n“The interesting part is that the onscreen energy may be epic and about real life story, but off-screen we are three young contemporary actors with different energies,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:00:10.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
