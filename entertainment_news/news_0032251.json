Unless I was in Star Wars.” Actor Christian Slater, his wife Ryan, son Jaden and daughter Eliana arrive for the premiere of the Disney/Pixar animation film The Incredibles, held at the Empire Leicester Square, central London.

Please, help me out, talk to some people and make it happen.” \nThe actor also praised shows like Breaking Bad, saying: “It’s virtually impossible to get the funds together to make an independent film these days, but luckily there are other platforms, so creative and talented people can get their visions seen.” \nHe also admitted he had sent Breaking Bad’s executive producer Vince Gilligan fan letters.
