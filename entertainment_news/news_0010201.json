Related Media BEAVER CREEK — The Vilar Performing Arts Center continues its annual Underground Sound Series of concerts with Nagata Shachu on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Japanese Taiko drumming group Nagata Shachu’s playing combines unbounded spirit with the highest levels of musicianship and discipline. Nagata Shachu is the fifth performance of the Underground Sound Series and the musicians vow to take the audience on a musical journey beyond all borders. ANCIENT ART FORM Nagata Shachu mesmerizes audiences with its heart-pounding performances, featuring a vast array of Japanese Taiko, including the massive O-Daiko, gongs, bells, wooden clappers, shakers and bamboo flutes. Rooted into the folk-drumming traditions of Japan, the group invigorates this ancient art form by combining primal drumbeats with subtle, intricate rhythms. Renowned for straightforward yet physically demanding performances, the result is an unforgettable experience that is both powerful in expression and heartfelt in its sincerity. “An emotional and exhilarating two hours of thunderous and hypnotic drumming,” writes Tammy Wilson, of the Bancroft Times. While ingrained in Japanese folk-drumming traditions, Nagata Shachu’s goal is to revitalize this ancient art form by making exciting music that creates a fresh voice for the Taiko. The ensemble is celebrated for its true-to-form performances, as well as for its varied repertoire, suitable for all ages.
