Spectre review: James Bond is back with a bang as Daniel Craig ramps up sex appeal October 22, 2015 10:29am Image Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes In 'Spectre' Final Trailer 1:18 \nA cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE. This is the final international trailer of the must see 'Spectre' in HD. October 5th 2015 On the rooftops ... James Bond is back. Charles Miranda News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nFROM the moment Daniel Craig peels off his macabre death mask to utter his first quip to a bedded buxom beauty, there is a not too subtle hint that James Bond is back. \nAnd not the dark mentally tortured 007 we saw three years ago in Skyfall , the most successful flick of the franchise, but a return to Bond of old , from the super agent’s origins 50 years ago that has seen him become the biggest British cinema exports of all time. Vintage cool ... Spectre marks a return to old-school Bond. Source: AP \nSpectre, the 24th Bond film, today had its world premiere in London to applause, albeit from an audience that was clearly prepared to cheer anything the 47-year-old Craig said or did in this his fourth outing as the man with the martini. \nIn the opening three minutes people die, a terrorist threat is thwarted and a quizzical Bond looks on as a quarter block of Mexico City explodes and crumbles about him as he straightens the cuffs of his impeccably fitting suit and walks from the rubble. Beauty ... Stephanie Sigman is the first Mexican actress to play a Bond girl in the film series. Source: Supplied \nIt’s all classic Bond, old-school stuff of bombs, babes and baddies albeit with a big budget 21st century makeover evident alone in its huge opening sequence set in Mexico on the Day of the Dead festivities. \nTrue to the plot line created by Skyfall , Bond is still going slightly rogue – a kite flying in a hurricane – as one of his nemeses will declare but only, as always, for the good of the secret service, world safety and to win the woman of the moment. Full of action ... the incredible opening sequence takes place in Mexico on the Day of the Dead festivities. Source: Supplied \nLots of surprises that I’m not about to spoil but suffice to say the plot again adds another dimension, a further backstory to understand why Bond is how he is. \nThe title alone Spectre references an sinister group that has featured in six previous 007s, namely From Russia With Love and Thunderball , but Austrian-born Christoph Waltz plays a new-style evil genius nemesis to Craig’s character while former professional wrestler Dave Bautista is the perfect heavy whose script involves just one word. Think henchman ‘Jaws’ from among others Moonraker . Stunning ... Monica Bellucci smoulders as Lucia Sciarra. Source: AFP \nThe film is long but the action well-paced and spaced with gadgets from Q (Ben Whishaw) and serious stuff from M reprised by Ralph Fiennes. \nLong-serving producers and guardians of the Ian Fleming character Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli were in the audience, chuffed with the response from the packed London crowd. \nForget golden gun, director Sam Mendes has shown his Midas touch on this his second foray with the agent that fans of the franchise will just love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:03:48.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
