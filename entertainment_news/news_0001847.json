This includes money supply (M3) and private sector credit data‚ as well as producer price inflation data (PPI)‚ followed by the country’s trade balance numbers on Friday.\nAccording to Ms Kaplan, PPI is expected to have risen to 3.6% year on year in September from 3.4% in August‚ with the largest contributor to the rise likely remaining the manufactured food category.\n\"Pipeline pressures for food prices signal a strengthening dynamic along the price chain‚ as the lag effects of the drought earlier in the year feed through. Lower oil prices should however‚ continue to buffer some of this increase.\n\"The relatively contained rate of increase in PPI inflation‚ coupled with CPI (consumer price inflation) that was softer than expectations‚ should provide the SARB (South African Reserve Bank) with room to keep interest rates unchanged at its next MPC meeting in November‚\" Ms Kaplan says.\nThe trade account‚ she predicts‚ is likely to have remained in deficit in the region of R5.5bn in September‚ after registering a deficit of R9.9bn in August.\n\"SA’s export growth has been tempered by the weak course of external demand for both mineral and base metal commodities‚ as well as manufactured goods. Although the weaker rand exchange rate has intensified pricing pressures from imports‚ the overall effect has been partially countered by the fall in commodity prices,\" says Ms Kaplan.\nShe says that growth in private sector credit extension (PSCE) should have remained moderate at 8.6% year on year in September‚ unchanged from August.\n\"The main restraining influence on PSCE growth is the continued modest growth in credit extended to households. Household credit dynamics have been affected by relatively tight credit conditions which are expected to persist as new regulations come into force in October 2015‚ pertaining to more rigorous affordability assessment criteria and lower interest rate caps on unsecured credit‚\" Ms Kaplan says.\nRDM News Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:14:07.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
