Relativity Media LLC (\"Relativity\") today announced that a consortium of investors led by CEO and Chairman Ryan Kavanaugh have completed its acquisition of all Relativity's assets. These transactions represent an important milestone toward the company's emergence from chapter 11 with a significantly fortified balance sheet.\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the consortium acquired Relativity's senior secured debt for $65 million in cash and $60 million in debt. As previously announced, the company has sold its unscripted television division for $125 million . As a next step, the consortium will shortly file a plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court detailing the company's capital structure and its strategy for long-term growth with film, digital, music, sports and branded entertainment. These transactions will effectively reduce the debt on Relativity's balance sheet by approximately 90 percent.\nKavanaugh stated, \"I am proud to say that we are moving quickly toward emerging from chapter 11 with a healthy balance sheet and an incredibly strong collection of assets, including Relativity Studios. We thank our partners and investors who have worked tirelessly to get us to this point, and our employees for their continued focus and commitment. Together, we will continue to build Relativity's asset base to offer brands unique access to a fully integrated 360 degree content engine.\"\nThe investor group, dubbed TJ, added: \"Relativity's 360 degree content engine is one which we have not seen in any other content company. The ways in which content is created and distributed, while incorporating and partnering with global brands, is highly unique. When that is paired with Relativity's risk adjusted model, the scripted television platform and their joint ventures in India and China , it makes the future particularly exciting. We look forward to building the new Relativity and taking it to the level at which the company belongs.\"\nAdditional information related to the proposed sale transaction and Relativity's Chapter 11 filing is available on the Company's website at www.relativitymedia.com/reorganization .
