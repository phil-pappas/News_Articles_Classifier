Therefore, the theme for the vigilance awareness this year is ‘preventive vigilance as a tool of good governance’, a release issued by Personnel Ministry said.”In order to convey the importance of preventive vigilance and also the message that corruption ultimately ends in a tragedy, eight short episodes, each of half-an-hour duration, have been made which would be telecast during the vigilance awareness week on Doordarshan’s DD national channel and DDK, Delhi station,” it said. \nInterviews of Chowdary and Bhasin would also be telecast on DD national and DDK, Delhi respectively during the vigilance awareness week, the release said.Chowdary would be participating and taking questions from the public on the issues related to anti-corruption in the ‘Public Speak’ programme on FM Gold channel of All India Radio which would be aired live on October 26, 2015 from 9.35 PM to 10.05 PM, it said. \nThe observance of vigilance awareness week will begin with taking of pledge on October 26 at 11 AM in all government and public sector organisations besides autonomous organisations and local bodies.Besides the regular activities of display of banners, posters, advertisements in the newspapers and organisation of activities such as lecture, panel discussions, competitions in government and public sector organisations, the Commission this year is reaching out to college and school students in a big way, the release said. \n“Debates, elocution or lectures are being organised in 100 cities and towns spread across the country. Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) of 101 organisations are involved in organising these competitions and each CVO has been assigned certain number of cities or towns with the instruction to organise these competitions in at least three colleges and two schools,” it said.It is expected that competitions would be organised in more than 2,000 colleges and schools across the country.The Commission has taken many initiatives during the last three months notably on preventive vigilance, reducing delay in disposal of disciplinary cases and vigilance clearance and increased use of IT. \nThe CVC has already received inputs on preventive vigilance from major organisations and is now working on coming up with an action plan specific to these organisations.Video conferencing facility for communicating with CVOs has also been put in place which would now ensure faster exchange communication leading to reduction in delay in disposal of cases.The Commission is also working on identifying the bottlenecks and making the vigilance clearance faster and paperless, the release said. \n  4:12 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:10:16.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
