That all fell apart during last season’s traumatic finale when Rick (Andrew Lincoln) killed Pete in the middle of a town meeting that went horribly awry. Now, as Season 6 of “The Walking Dead” gets underway, Rick has a lot of wary eyes looking his way, including those of old pal Morgan Jones (Lennie James). 9 p.m., AMC.\n■ Elizabeth (Tea Leoni) gets some advice from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who guest stars as herself on “Madam Secretary.” Elizabeth needs Albright’s help while trying to negotiate the safe return of a State Department employee who was kidnapped in Afghanistan. 8 p.m., CBS.\n■ Metro Detroit native Mary Lynn Rajskub (“24”) is the latest familiar face to drop in on “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” She plays a gallery owner and Jake (Andy Samberg) thinks she just might be Boyle’s (Joe Lo Truglio) soul mate, so he tries to set them up. 8:30 p.m., Fox.\nMONDAY\n■ The new musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” just might be a crazy good time. Rachel Bloom shines as a successful, but unhappy, New York lawyer who moves across the country to win back her former summer camp sweetheart.

Here, fashion designer Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson) tries to bring a touch of couture to the creepy Hotel Cortez, and a model catches the eye of the Countess (Lady Gaga). 10 p.m., FX.\nTHURSDAY\nLet’s just call it “The Blacklist” road show. This week, Red (James Spader) and Liz (Megan Boone) head for the Midwest in their ongoing quest to take down the Cabal and exonerate Liz. 9 p.m., NBC.\nFRIDAY\n“Truth Be Told” is a new sitcom that follows two couples (Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Vanessa Lachey, Tone Bell and Bresha Webb) and their frank discussions about race, sex, politics and other touchy subjects. But the truth is, we just want it to be funny. 8:30 p.m., NBC.\nSATURDAY\n“Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo” is a new stand-up special that has the country’s hottest comedian bringing her honest and unapologetic humor to an audience at the iconic New York theater.
