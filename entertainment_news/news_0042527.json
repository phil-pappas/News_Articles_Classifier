PETERSBURG, FL (AP) - The owner of a Florida media company says that a radio host tried to influence the listening habits of a person who was participating in a ratings survey. \nIn a statement Monday, Beasley Media said DJ Bubba The Love Sponge Clem was contacted directly by someone who had a ratings device to measure listening habits. \nBeasley said that Clem attempted to influence the person participating in a Nielsen survey. \nThe media company said Clem's conduct had no effect on the Tampa Bay radio ratings because the improper activity was discovered quickly. Nielsen removed the participant's results from the survey. Beasley's Tampa station won't be included in the September 2015 ratings report. \nBeasley said it \"strongly condemned\" Clem's actions, and said Clem and his staff must undergo ratings compliance training.
