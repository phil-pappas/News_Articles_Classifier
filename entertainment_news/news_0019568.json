Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said he supports a statewide licensing system for ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. Cuomo’s remarks come after Uber announced Tuesday it would undertake a campaign to get a statewide law so it could bring its service to upstate New York and the Hudson Valley.\n“You have taxis in Rochester, taxis in Buffalo, taxis in New York City,” Cuomo told reporters after an event in Manhattan. “But this would be a statewide franchise. We want to make sure there’s a level playing field, so they can compete the same way everybody else competes and they don’t have any advantage.”\nUber said it needs a state law because of the patchwork of regulations in municipalities that oversee the livery industry, as well as the need for new insurance laws.\nAlso, a state law would allow users to hail rides using its peer-to-peer app. Currently, Uber operates in New York City, but acts largely as any other taxi service and doesn’t have special rules governing it.\nUber praised the Democratic governor’s comments.\n“It is clear that state leaders are hearing the voices of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who are clamoring for services like Uber across the state,” Uber spokeswoman Alix Anfang said in a statement, “from potential driver-partners who want to use the platform to earn money to riders who want a safe, reliable and affordable way to get around their communities.”\nCuomo said since Uber and its competitor Lyft would operate statewide — unlike most taxi companies that are regionally based — a law is needed.\n“You can’t do Uber city by city,” Cuomo said. “You can’t say to an Uber, ‘Well, go city by city in the state and come up with a licensing permit.’ Because you’d have 200 different varieties.”\nThe legislative session resumes in January and the issue will likely be one of the key ones for the state Legislature to consider.\nSome lawmakers have been cautious about crafting a law that could benefit a few companies and the impact it could have on existing livery companies.\n“We have to go slowly and safely,” Assembly Transportation Committee chairman David Gantt, D-Rochester, said.\nUber on Tuesday estimated it would have 13,000 drivers in upstate New York who would fulfill 500,000 trips a month. The San Francisco-based company said that 350,000 New Yorkers outside New York City have downloaded its app.\nConcerns have been raised by the taxi industry that a state law would infringe on existing businesses and usurp any regulations in New York City, where Uber has faced resistance.\nJames Weisman, president of the United Spinal Association, urged Cuomo to require Uber to be accessible for people in wheelchairs.\n“Governor Cuomo has an opportunity to lead the nation by making New York the first state to require 100 percent wheelchair accessibility for Uber,” Weisman said in a statement. “The governor’s support brought wheelchair-accessible taxis to New York City, and now he can do it statewide.”\nCuomo said municipalities would still maintain some local control with any state regulations.\n“You have a statewide license and then local governments can do local regulations of their taxis and limousines, but you’d have a statewide license for statewide operators,” Cuomo said. “Because, think about it, it couldn’t work otherwise.”\nJSPECTOR@Gannett.com\nwww.twitter.com/gannettalbany", "external_links": ["http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/new-york/2015/10/20/uber-pledges-jobs-faces-challenges/74290796/"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:02:55.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
