Tasmanian band The Wolfe Brothers perform tomorrow at Longley before heading to Nashville, USA. Source: Supplied \nLOCAL legends The Wolfe Brothers started out playing gigs at the Longley International Hotel and Margate Tavern as soon as they were old enough to get into the venues. \nBut band member Nick Wolfe said their first big goal was to perform in Hobart venue Irish Murphy’s. \n“We did that, then set our sights a bit higher and kept upping the venue goals,” Wolfe said. \nThe country-rock band took a leap in 2012 when they signed up for TV show Australia’s Got Talent , with the musos working their way up to second place by the end of the series. \nNext month they’ll head out on a trip to Nashville, where they will spend months writing and recording their next album. \nBut first they return to the place where it all began for their going-away party gig Bon Voyage — Nashville Hear We Come at Longley tomorrow. \nEnd of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar. \n“We all grew up within five minutes of the Longley pub and spent plenty of time on the stage down there, as well as around the bar, so it’s one of our favourite venues to play,” Wolfe said. \nLoyal fans in the town have been there for the whole journey as the four lads made their way to fame. \nSo how does it feel for them to return to the venue that helped launch their career? \n“It’s amazing — I think that’s why it’s so special for us,” Wolfe said. \n“We were literally playing for beer, so to still come back after all these years is one of the most special gigs we can do.” \nThe Wolfe Brothers line-up features siblings Nick and Tom Wolfe and their childhood mates Casey Kostiuk and Brodie Rainbird. \nAfter they left school they spent about six years playing in pubs and clubs, where they sold thousands of copies of an initial four-track EP, before releasing their debut album, It’s On, in 2013. The album cemented The Wolfe Brothers’ place as a popular touring band and allowed the members to quit their jobs. \nNick gave up being a postman, Tom quit labouring, Casey stopped making false teeth as a dental mechanic, and Brodie is no longer a refrigeration mechanic. \nThe album made it into the ARIA charts and saw them nominated for four Golden Guitar Awards at last year’s Australian Country Music Awards. \nThis year has been another busy one for the band. They released their latest album, Nothin’ But Trouble , which also performed well on the ARIA charts. The first single released from the album, That Kinda Night , reached No.1 on country radio and the CMC video charts. \nThe latest release from The Wolfe Brothers is a double-disc live DVD and CD called The Wolfe Brothers Live at CMC Rocks QLD 2015 . \nIt features “crowd favourites” from their former releases, along with covers of songs by famous Aussie musos such as Slim Dusty and The Dingoes. \n“We’ve always prided ourselves on being a good live band,” Wolfe said. \n“The studio environment can become a bit sterile, but when you’re out in the crowd making music for your best mates it tends to go up a notch. \n“We’ve known each other for such a long time, us four blokes, and I think that’s when we’re truly in the moment.” \nThe boys have this year toured with rocker and Rose Tattoo frontman Angry Anderson, and recently joined Aussie country legend Lee Kernaghan as special guests in a 30-date tour of The Songs and The Stories In Concert , to celebrate Kernaghan’s latest album The Spirit of the Anzacs. \nThe boys head to Nashville on November 15 — the day after their final show with Kernaghan. They plan to spend a few months writing songs before heading back to Australia. \nThey will play a quick show at the New South Wales Tamworth Country Music Festival, and after that will fly straight out again to record their next album in Nashville. \n“We’re not going to make the album until we’ve got the right collection of songs, so we’ll just get full-on into writing and soak it all up over there,” Wolfe said. \nWhile they’re there, the rockers plan to line up performances in front of record companies in a bid to break into the American market. \nBut Wolfe assures us they’re “not buggering off overseas and never coming back”. \n“We’re just going over there for a while to write some new songs, make some new music, work on an album, and just get better at what we do,” he said. \nThe Wolfe Brothers will perform their farewell gig, Bon Voyage — Nashville Hear We Come , at the Longley International Hotel at 3pm on Sunday. Tickets are $25, phone the pub on 62396378 to book, and pick them up with cash at the venue. \nThis is an over-18 event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:10:35.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
