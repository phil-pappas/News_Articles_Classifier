As the series starts, Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ) is attempting to rebuild her life - albeit a drunken, isolated life as a P.I. - when her past comes back to torment her in the form of Killgrave ( David Tennant ), who psychologically tortured and controlled her for months. Jessica is forced to confront her own PTSD from her previous relationship with Killgrave in order to track him down and face him in the present. Let's just say, things get dark. Fast. In addition to diving deep into the Jessica Jones mythology, the noir drama will also introduce Mike Colter as Luke Cage, who will be spinning off into his own Netflix series soon. Jessica Jones premieres Friday, Nov. 20 on Netflix.
