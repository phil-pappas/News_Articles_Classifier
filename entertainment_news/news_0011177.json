He is sought there on charges of having fled to avoid serving the remainder of his prison term for having sex with a minor in 1977.\nKaczynski's party puts special stress on morality and equality of all before law. He used Polanski's case as an example of a tendency toward a lenient approach to celebrities, prevalent in the media.\n\"There was open talk that he should not be made responsible for his deeds because he is an outstanding, world-famous filmmaker,\" Kaczynski said.\n\"We will totally reject this attitude,\" if the party comes to power, he said.\nA Polish court is weighing a U.S. request for Polanski's extradition. A verdict could come on Oct. 30, by which time the election winner will be known. Kaczynski's party is leading in opinion polls.\nIf the judge refuses to hand Polanski over, the case is closed. If he allows the extradition, the final decision will lie with the justice minister.\nPolanski has Polish roots and is in the process of making a movie in Poland.\nHis lawyer, Jan Olszewski, told The Associated Press he believes that any comment on the case, without detailed knowledge of the evidence and all its aspects is \"totally groundless.\"\nPolitics & Government Elections Roman Polanski Jaroslaw Kaczynski", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:54:09.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
