Whether the speculations are true or not, welcoming a baby in the middle of the post-apocalyptic period could prove to be an ambivalent experience for the couple, according to the Inquisitr. \nIn the first episode of \"The Walking Dead\" season 6, Rick's team battled a large army of zombie walkers that penetrated Alexandria's walls. Sadly, Carter became a casualty when a zombie bit him, so Rick had to kill him. Gabriel also expressed his intention to help in the mission, but Rick immediately blocked him, Penn Live reports. \nWhile the Alexandria group's discussion was interesting, what really set fans abuzz was Glenn and Maggie's conversation. The couple managed to snag a brief moment of privacy where Glenn asked Maggie to stay and take care of the newly widowed Deanna. In addition, Glenn insinuated that Maggie had another big reason to stay away from danger, and this got fans talking that she could be pregnant. \nWhile a baby is good news for most couples, Maggie's pregnancy could bring something else for them. There were reports that an actor had been cast to play the character of a villain called Negan. In the comic series, Negan will brutally kill Glenn using a baseball bat with barbed wire. \nStill, there is a chance that Negan might not get the chance to kill Glenn because \"The Walking Dead\" has been known to tweak the details of the death of its characters. In the original comic book, Tyreese was beheaded by the Governor, but Hershel was the one who was executed that way in the series. \nMeanwhile, Enid was seen loitering around the woods and killing a zombie inside a car. She then wrote the letters \"JSS\" on the window of the vehicle. While nobody still knows what JSS stands for, there are speculations that Enid could be a mole and what she wrote was a secret message for the human Wolves. \n\"The Walking Dead\" season 6 airs every Sunday at 9 p.m. on AMC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:20:15.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
