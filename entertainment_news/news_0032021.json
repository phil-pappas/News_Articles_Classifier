Bloch didn’t even include the Blue Rider group on his resume when he was hired in 1923 by the University of Kansas as a professor and head of its department of painting and drawing. \nBloch also didn’t mount a commercial art exhibit after 1921. He chose instead to become independent from the art market and showed his work by invitation only. He taught at KU until his retirement in 1947, and he continued to live, paint and write poetry in Lawrence until his death in 1961. \nAbout his career decisions, Bloch is quoted as saying, “On the whole, I am an impossible creature, quite willing to remain an obscure, rough-hewn square peg, if only I may keep my inward freedom.” \nOne of the subjects Bloch often explored in his art and poetry were narratives from the Bible, some of which are the subject of the Mulvane show. \n“Throughout five decades of artistic activity Bloch consistently turned to biblical themes,” Janzen wrote. “For him spiritual searching and genuine faith were a unifying force in his life and work. He kept a Bible at his bedside and marked it as he read in it. However, he never joined a church.” \nJanzen added, “Both in his writings and his art, he criticized the hypocrisy among professed believers of all denominations.” \nRather than organize “Albert Bloch: Scenes from the Life of Christ” chronologically by when they were created, Janzen chose to arrange them in the sequence of the New Testament accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, dividing them into four sections: “Christ’s Incarnation and Childhood,” “Christ’s Ministry,” “Christ’s Passion” and “The Resurrection of Christ.” \n“Bloch’s images are never mere illustrations of biblical themes, but interpretations of the existential affinity he felt for Christ’s prophetic words,” Janzen wrote. “As such they also allude to events in the artist’s personal life as well as those of the world and times he lived in, including the sufferings and devastation of World Wars I and II.” \n“Albert Bloch: Scenes from the Life of Christ” was built around three large religious paintings by Bloch given to the Mulvane Art Museum about 10 years ago by the brothers Gregory and Eric Voth of Topeka, whose father, Harold, collected Bloch paintings for more than 50 years. Other works in the exhibit come from the collection of a third Voth brother, Nicholas, and from the Albert Bloch Foundation of Kansas City, Mo., which was founded by the artist’s wife, Anna Bloch, who died in 2014 in Lawrence at the age of 101. \nBloch’s contributions to the world of art were championed by his widow who reached out to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, which in 1997 mounted the retrospective exhibit “Albert Bloch: the American Blue Rider,” which also was shown at the Stadtische Galerie im Lenbachhause in Munich and the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington. \nBloch’s works also have been shown at the Spencer Museum at the University of Kansas, where scholars have researched and written about him. \nOne of them is David Cateforis, a KU professor of art history, who has written several articles on Bloch and is co-curator of “Albert Bloch: Themes and Variations, Paintings and Watercolors from the Albert Bloch Foundation,” which is on display through Jan. 2 at the Lawrence Arts Center, 940 New Hampshire, Lawrence. \nIn support of the Mulvane exhibit, Cateforis will present at 6 p.m. Nov. 10 a lecture on how Bloch would revisit a relatively small number of biblical themes during his career but alter his interpretations of them. \nBloch’s poetry, specifically his epic poem, “Garden of Asses,” which tells the Christian story from Christ’s point of view, also will be explored. At 6 p.m. Dec. 1, selections from the poem will be read by Eric McHenry, assistant professor of English at Washburn University and the current poet laureate of Kansas, and Jeffrey Weinburg, a retired KU administrator and a painter with a long-standing interest in Bloch’s art and poetry. \nJanzen also will lead a tour of the exhibit and discuss it at 4 p.m. Jan. 20. \nMore about the Mulvane Art Museum and its other current and forthcoming exhibits can be found at www.washburn.edu/mulvane . \nBill Blankenship can be reached at (785) 295-1284 or bill.blankenship@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:26:42.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
