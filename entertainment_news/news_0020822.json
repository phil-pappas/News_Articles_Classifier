Turner Prize for Innovation in Construction.\nTurner established the Prize—which comes with a $25,000 honorarium—at the National Building Museum, to recognize an advance or high achievement in the process of construction: an invention, an innovative methodology, and/or exemplary leadership.\nCTBUH was selected for its long history of leadership in facilitating research and promoting education, as well as for its invaluable contributions to the building industry, which has benefitted from the Council’s work related to tall buildings and urban planning issues around the world.\nDavid Malott, chairman of the CTBUH said, “We are honored to receive this recognition and will utilize the honorarium to conduct an audit of the cutting edge technologies across all fields that contribute to tall buildings. We will create a positional paper that would be of value to all our membership, especially tall building developers who always want to know what the latest technologies are in each field.”\nThe CTBUH is widely known for its role as the arbiter of what constitutes a tall building, a role that has grown increasingly prominent with the rise of supertall and megatall projects. In addition, the Council has created an international intellectual community, connecting industry professionals—including developers, architects, engineers, builders, urban planners, environmentalists and more—and offering them access to wide variety of resources including the Council’s robust database of technical papers, videos, and building information.\nThrough the publication of these technical papers, best practices, and other materials developed by scientists, engineers, and thought leaders on nearly every aspect of tall building construction, the Council has established itself as the industry’s resource when it comes to planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining increasingly sophisticated and complex tall, supertall, and megatall building projects.\nIn addition to these achievements, the Turner Prize honors the vision, ambition, and sense of social responsibility that drove Council founder Lynn Beedle to establish CTBUH, as expressed in a 1992 article. He wrote, “The need [for the Council]stemmed from things like the exploding urban population, creating an increased demand for tall buildings; the need for economy in construction; the frequent neglect of human factors at the expense of livability and the quality of life; the need for new research required in the field; and the necessity of establishing priorities for such reasons.”\nMembers of the Prize jury are David Childs, chairman emeritus, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Chris McFadden, vice president, Turner Construction Company; Hal Parmalee, former president, Turner Construction Company; and Jan Tuchman, editor-in-chief, Engineering News-Record.\nThe prize will be presented by Peter Davoren, president and chief executive officer of Turner, Chase W. Rynd, president and executive director of the National Building Museum, at the CTBUH International Conference in New York City, October 26, 2015. Information on attending the conference and award presentation is available at http://www.ctbuh2015.com/ .\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat is the 13th recipient of the Turner Prize, which has been awarded in the past to the Engineering Department at Pennsylvania State University, Leslie Robertson, I.M Pei, Charles DeBenedittis, The U.S. Green Building Council, Paul Teicholz, Gehry Partners and Gehry Technologies, Charlie Thornton, Engineers Without Borders – USA, Caterpillar, Inc., Society of Women Engineers, and the Lean Construction Institute.\nAbout Turner Construction Company\nTurner is a North America-based, international construction services company.
