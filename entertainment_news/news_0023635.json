(AP Photo/Charles Sykes, File) Report an error \nSAN FRANCISCO -- Robin Williams' widow and his three children from previous marriages reached a settlement in their legal fight over the late actor's estate, attorneys for the two sides said Friday. \nJim Wagstaffe, who is representing Susan Williams, said his client will remain in the San Francisco Bay Area home she shared with Williams and receive living expenses for the rest of her life. \nHe said she also will receive a watch he often wore, a bike they bought on their honeymoon, and the gifts received for their wedding. \nMeredith Bushnell represents the three children from previous marriage -- Zachary, Zelda and Cody. \n\"I think they're just very happy to have this behind them,\" Bushnell said. \nThe settlement, which is subject to a judge's approval, ends a bitter and public dispute following the beloved comedian's suicide in 2014. \nAmong the items in dispute were watches, memorabilia, the tuxedo he was married in and photographs taken on his 60th birthday, according to court documents and previous statements by attorney Wagstaffe. \nSusan Williams said in papers filed in December that the contents of the San Francisco Bay Area home she shared with Robin Williams should be excluded from the items the actor left to his children. \nShe also claimed some of her husband's personal items were taken without her permission. \nWilliams' three children countered that Susan Williams was \"adding insult to a terrible injury\" by trying to change the trust agreement and deprive them of items that their father clearly intended to leave to them. \nThe dispute resulted in several court appearances before a San Francisco judge and mediation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:20:07.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
