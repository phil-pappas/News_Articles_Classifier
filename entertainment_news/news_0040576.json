Here are a few responses.\nDavid Liss , author of “The Day of Atonement”\n“When I was much younger, I was easily — and happily — creeped out by reading scary fiction, but I find it unusual for a horror novel to get under my skin now that I’m an adult. One recent novel that managed to get the job done, however, was Lauren Beukes ’ “Broken Monsters,” which included all-too-realistic parental fears about children, but also a deranged killer who horrifically combines human and animal bodies. The book is also (brilliantly, in my view) set in a decaying and crumbling Detroit, which functions like the world’s largest haunted house. This novel is original and surprising and twisted in all the best ways.”\nCary Clack , author of “Clowns and Rats Scare Me”\n“I thought I was going to go with the ‘The Collected Tales of Edgar Allan Poe ’ or ‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,’ but the deeper I thought of it I realized the answer is Toni Morrison ’s ‘Beloved.’ It’s not only a ghost story, it’s one given form by our history and the sin of slavery. It’s frightening because of why ‘Beloved’ is a ghost and a reminder of how we continue to be haunted by our past.”\nAndrew Porter , author of “In Between Days”\n“This wouldn’t count as a book, but the scariest short story I’ve ever read is Joyce Carol Oates ’ ‘Where Are You Going? Where Have You Been?’ I remember reading it for the first time in college, thinking it was just a fairly traditional coming-of-age story, but nothing prepared me for where that story was headed. I now teach it pretty frequently in my own fiction classes at Trinity University , though I always warn my students not to read it late at night when they’re sitting alone in their dorm rooms.”\nJan Jarboe Russell , author of “The Train to Crystal City”\n“This may sound wimpy as I avoid scary books because as a teenager in the 1960s I read Truman Capote ’s ‘In Cold Blood,’ and it frightened the wits out of me. I think it was because I lived in a small town in East Texas and the Clutter family’s life was similiar to my own. My family was God-fearing, my parents worked hard, and we rarely locked our doors. So, when I got to that scene where the two convicts broke into the house in the middle of the night, awakened the Clutter family, bound them and then murdred the mother, father and two children with shotguns, it felt like something that could have happened to my own family. In other words, it was immediate, and Capote’s writing was so vivid and chilling that I couldn’t sleep for days and days. I remember I called a family meeting with my parents and my brother and after that meeting, we locked our doors every night.”\nYvette Benavides , English professor, Our Lady of the Lake University\n“‘We Have Always Lived in the Castle’ by Shirley Jackson . Published in 1965. This is a book my older sister and I shared — one we used to play ‘The Reading Game,’ which was not much of a game. The rules were one person read aloud until she made a mistake — stumbled over a word. That would cue the next person’s turn to read. I never wanted my sister to make a mistake because I loved the way she read aloud. The book is also about two sisters — Merricat and Constance. They care for their elderly uncle, who reveals much of the backstory about the girls’ family being poisoned by blackberries sprinkled with arsenic-laced sugar. Constance was arrested for the murders because she had not used the sugar on her blackberries. The two sisters are shut-ins, mostly reclusive. Only Merricat leaves the home to go into the village to buy supplies or groceries. Each time she steps out of the home, she is taunted and bullied by everyone. Here is the chant the villagers used. My sister used to read it in a very spooky voice.\nMerricat, said Connie, would you like a cup of tea?\nOh, no, said Merricat, you’ll poison me.\nMerricat, said Connie, would you like to go to sleep?\nDown in the boneyard ten feet deep!\nCan you imagine? And I’d ask her to read it ‘again again’ even though I was shivering in pure spine-tingling fear!”\nCompiled by Steve Bennett", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815310/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815308/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815307/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815312/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815314/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815311/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815307/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815308/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815306/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815312/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/33/66/62/7302333/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815310/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/33/66/62/7302333/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815306/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815311/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815309/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815309/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/13/8815314/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:27:41.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
