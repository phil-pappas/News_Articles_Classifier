Then, is rescheduled for 4. Then, 4:15. Finally, at close to 5, the phone rings. \n\"I'm so sorry,\" says Carey Mulligan. \"The baby wanted feeding, and I'm really on her schedule now.\" \nUnderstood – Mulligan's daughter, Evelyn, with husband Marcus Mumford , isn't even a month old. Still, being at someone else's beck and call is a bit different for the 30-year-old actress who, since she first grabbed stardom with 2009's \"An Education,\" has been definitely following her own drumbeat. \nEarlier this year she had \"Far From the Madding Crowd,\" a terrific new version of the Thomas Hardy novel. Now, she's back in period costume for \"Suffragette\" – a bracing tale of the turn-of-the-century movement and how it fought, very hard, to win women the vote and begin the push for gender equality. \nA fight, Mulligan notes, that's still going on. \nIt's a topic – along with career choices, the power of words and a certain misunderstood T-shirt – that she took time to chat about, in between Evelyn's full-throated demands. \nQ: So what I liked about \"Suffragette\" is that we're used to thinking about the early days of this movement as a lot of women carrying signs and shaking parasols. But in this story, we're at the barricades. There's police brutality, and bombs and prison. Is that part of what appealed to you about the project? \nA: Yeah, I had this quite sanitized idea of what the movement was. I really didn't know about the rioting, and the hunger striking and the force feeding – none of that was taught to me at school. I knew women had gone to prison, but it was very, very vague and reading it was an eye opener. And I was signed on to this for a while, so I had a fair amount of time to do my own reading. \nQ: And did that help inform your character? This laundress who takes to the streets? \nA: Very much so. The working-class women who fought for the vote, they had much less access to education than the upper classes; many of them were illiterate, so a lot of their experiences went unrecorded. You kind of have to dig around. But there are prison diaries that exist, and letters. It's really a fascinating era, because the suffrage movement, that was really the first time the classes mixed in Britain – working-class women and upper-class women realizing they had something in common, and coming together. That was unheard of then. And that's why it was censored by the higher powers, all of whom were men, of course. \nQ: Obviously, in real life you're not at home scrubbing shirt collars... \nA: Well, nappies! \nQ: ...but what about the inequality in your own profession? This is a movie about the fight for equal rights. And there's been a lot of talk recently about Hollywood sexism -- the pay gaps between actors and actresses, the kinds of opportunities denied female filmmakers, the sorts of roles that are written and the projects that don't get made. \nA: Well, I do have to say first off that we're still in a pretty privileged position, in the West and in this profession; women around the world are struggling with much, much more. But yes, there is a pay gap between men and women in Hollywood. And there are definitely less interesting roles for actresses than actors. \nQ: Will that change once we get more women writing movies? Writing about movies? \nA: I think so. You know Meryl (Streep) was saying the other day that she'd gone on Rotten Tomatoes, and I think there were three times as many male critics as female ones. Well, when you're looking for a movie to see, and 75% of the opinions you see are coming from a male perspective, how does that affect your choice? Geena Davis has spoken about a survey that said, in films, only 17% of the extras in crowd scenes are female. Seventeen percent. We're being made, literally, invisible. That's become the norm. I think as more women become involved in film, at every level, that can't help but change. \nQ: Haven't you helped change it, some? By working with female directors? By seeking out well-rounded roles? They're very different women, but the thing about your characters in \"An Education,\" in \"Shame,\" in \"Far from the Madding Crowd,\" is that they're allowed to be just as full and flawed as any male character. \nA: They're real . That's the funny thing, I remember when \"Shame\" came out, people said, \"Oh, she's such a strong female character!\" And I thought, oh lord, strong? She's so fragile, so damaged. But people are used to seeing these one-dimensional female caricatures – that's what written, that's what actresses are given to play – that when you do something that's real, they don't quite have the words for it. \nQ: Well, it's a feminist idea, isn't it: That your character can be just as forceful, or just as screwed-up, as the hero? And yet \"feminist\" is a word that seems to have been twisted. Even a lot of women won't use it. \nA: When I was doing press for \"Far From the Madding Crowd,\" a journalist asked me I were a feminist, and I said, Yes. And then he turned to (co-star) Matthias Schoenaerts and asked, \"So, how did it feel to be under her thumb?\" Really! I mean, if you look at the word, at the basic idea, it's about equality. That's all. But it's gotten this odd connotation, as if it's about women trying to quash men. \"Feminist\" has become this slightly taboo word. But I think that's begun to shift. \nQ: Talking about words, the cast of \"Suffragette\" did a photo shoot, wearing theT-shirt \"I'd rather be a rebel than a slave.\" It's a quote from a leader of the suffrage movement, but then it got misinterpreted, in this country at least, as somehow being pro-Confederacy, and racist. \nA: It was taken out of context. Obviously, it's a movie that we want to spur debate, about a lot of issues, but I think people just reacted to the photo without reading the article. \nQ: How hard is it, though, to have the kind of discussions that movies like yours want to spark? In an age when everybody's rushing to the Internet to just react. \nA: I think that's true, we do live in the Twittersphere, now -- although I am so completely not a part of that, and never really have been. And I understand with the news cycle these things get traction, and become big, big stories. That's all right. I just wouldn't want it to cloud the fact that the story we told is meant to empower people, and make you think. Unlike a lot of films that are about absolutely nothing and a lot that are just trash. \nQ: You haven't announced any projects after this one. Are you taking some time off? \nA: It's always been a bit of a waiting game for me. Of course, it's hard to get a lead unless you're a huge Hollywood blockbuster star, and it's difficult to get interesting movies going – \"Suffragette\" was in the works for about six years, and fell apart a number of times. But I don't like working too much anyway. I think you take on too many roles, it becomes a little difficult to convince the audience; you can't play eight other people in a year and have them accept you as all of them. But no, I don't have anything lined up just yet. I'm going to enjoy going on holiday, actually. And maybe getting a bit of sleep. \nStephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhitty@gmail.com .
