Now it's time for the final six in each category to go to their respective Judges' house, or some gaff they pretend is theirs anyways. As usual, they won't be whittling down their final three for live shows on their own, and will be joined by a celeb pal of their choice - Simon by One Direction heart-throb Louis Tomlinson, Cheryl by chart star Jess Glynne, Rita by US sensation Meghan Trainor and Nick by leading producer Mark Ronson. However, in a first for the show, the acts won't find out if they made it into their judge's final three until tomorrow night's live show. X Factor was actually planning on airing Judges Houses live too, but thankfully some bright spark realised that would be a logistical nightmare. Although... would have made for some pretty excellent car crash TV in fairness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:04:55.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
