Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright finally makes a cameo TV appearance, as the real-life Madam Secretary gives advice to CBS's fictional version.\nUSA TODAY\nCritic's Corner chat: Mon., 2 p.m. ET\nSteven Yeun returns as Glenn Rhee in the Season 6 premiere of 'The Walking Dead.' (Photo: Gene Page, AMC)\nThe Walking Dead\nAMC, 9 ET/PT\nOdds are true Walking Dead -heads don't have to be told what's walking their way, as they've been counting the days since this incredibly popular series ended its season. But just in case: Dead returns Sunday for another eight-episode run. The first outing runs an extended 90 minutes, and be prepared to watch quickly, as secrets won't hold.\nThe Good Wife\nCBS, 9:30 ET/9 PT\nGood Wife follows its strong start with an even better second episode, as Alicia tackles a suitably complex case pitting artistic freedom against personal rights. Every shift the show has made in this new season looks promising, starting with the addition of three terrific and well-incorporated actors — Margo Martindale, Cush Jumbo and, this week, Jeffrey Dean Morgan — and including a shift in Alicia's outlook that has returned some lightness to the character. Eventually, it might be nice to see Alicia work her way back into Diane's good graces, but for now, Good Wife stands as a testament to the ability of an excellent series to change course without losing its way.\n4 CONNECT 30 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1RAHOGP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1221c86d8ccd79934a062e1943c8982ae9d9a8c3/r=377x400/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795483805532176-106731-D0730b.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795483805532176-106731-D0730b.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/889d64254446be76c104c394ad9d0f52a035e093/c=202-0-3398-2403&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795485656027900-TWD-601-GP-0504-0184.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RAHOGP&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1RAHOGP", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14bca312384e1581ead2abcc601b7e6dd4e97d2d/c=179-0-1679-2000&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795483805532176-106731-D0730b.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RAHOGP&text=Sunday%20TV%3A%20%27Madam%20Secretary%2C%27%20%27Walking%20Dead%27&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2012/10/11/critics-corner-promo-01-1_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:12:54.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
