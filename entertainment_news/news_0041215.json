(Twitter | @HessToyTruck) Comments \nHess Toy Trucks are continuing to be a holiday tradition, even if its gas stations are no more. \nThe 2015 Hess toy truck has been revealed, but the classic green-and-white design has been replaced with new retail owner Speedway's primary color: Red. This year's vehicle is a red fire truck and ladder rescue vehicle, featuring oversized tires, swiveling chrome-detailed fire hose nozzles, LED lights, and four sound effects. \nAccording to the Associated Press, Hess Corp. had been selling toy trucks annually at its gas stations during the holidays since 1964. Past designs typically featured green-and-white trucks that matched Hess' logo, sometimes with yellow trim or extras like oil tanks, cars and even a spaceship cruiser last year. In 50 years, Hess sold red fire trucks just four times before, in 1970, 1971, 1986 and 2005. \nHowever, Hess sold its retail gas stations last year, and locations throughout Central New York have been converted to Speedway . Hess remains in the business of finding and drilling for oil and natural gas, according to the AP. \nBut the popular Christmas gift continues: The 2015 Hess Toy Truck is available for $30.99 starting Nov. 1 at www.hesstoytruck.com . Free standard shipping and five Energizer batteries are included. The newest Hess Toy Truck is here! Order online Nov. 1st. $30.99, free standard shipping. http://t.co/ixHlAG4z5U pic.twitter.com/pefKKDnzXU â€” Hess Toy Truck (@hesstoytruck) October 19, 2015 \nThe truck will not be available at Speedway gas stations, but will be on sale at malls in New York City and New Jersey starting Nov. 12. The company is also producing 100 collectible silver edition toy trucks that will be randomly awarded in place of the regular truck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:31:32.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
