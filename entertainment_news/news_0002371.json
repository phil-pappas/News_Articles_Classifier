Photo: Instagram \nBachelorette Australia: Sasha wins Sam's heart The real price of reality TV spoilers Fans unleash fury at Daily Mail spoiler We all know Canberra's Sasha Mielczarek showed some quick moves in winning the heart of The Bachelorette 's Sam Frost - and he also had them on the rugby field as well.\nThe Canberra Times ' own Graham Tidy captured an action shot of Sasha playing for Uni Norths in 2012 and going in for a killer tackle of Wests' player Drew Southwell.\nQueenslander Drew with his owl - not a Uni-Norths' owl unfortunately - meeting The Bachelorette Sam Frost Photo: supplied \n\"No wonder the Bachelorette Sam Frost couldn't escape him,\" one wag posted on Facebook.\nAdvertisement Mielczarek, a 30-year-old construction manager who was Frost's last man standing in The Bachelorette finale on Thursday night, never really revealed his Canberra connections, preferring instead to say he was from Sydney.\nBut he had plenty of links to the national capital, also working as a project manager for local company Geocon Building, photographed in 2013 working on a job to convert the old Juliana House building into the Abode Woden hotel.\nSasha Mielczarek, who won the heart of The Bachelorette Sam Frost, goes in for a killer tackle playing for Uni-Norths rugby team in Canberra in 2012 Photo: Graham Tidy \nGeocon human resources manager Suzy Eastman said Mielczarek worked for the company in Canberra for a couple of years until April.\n\"He was a really good guy and I think the show portrayed him as that. He was a fun guy to work with,\" she said.\nMielczarek was also the person who took up much of Geocon's community work, helping to fundraise for causes such as Movember and for breast cancer research.\nSasha Mielczarek (right) working in 2013 on a project to convert the old Juliana House in Woden into a hotel. Photo: Elesa Lee \n\"He was always the one steamrolling that,\" Ms Eastman said.\nEveryone in the company had been following the show and the result was \"the talk of the town this morning\".\n\"It was exciting,\" Ms Eastman said. \"I was getting a little bit teary, it was so sweet.\"\nThe media has also made much of his broken engagement, some time ago, to Martina Males, who is the group marketing manager for the Doma Group in Canberra.\nIt has been reported Mielczarek is currently ensconced on the South Coast with Frost.\nOn Thursday night, he posted a photo of them together on Instagram.\n\"Words cannot express how elated I am to be with this wonderful young lady! Not only do I adore her but I think she is the most grounded, funny and family orientated girl I have ever met,\" he wrote.\nFacebook comments regarding Mielczarek's rugby ability described him as a \"hard-running, big-tackling centre\".\nAnother person posted that he was \"a nice bloke... No bullshit type of guy\".\nThe Uni Norths are known as the Owls. But, of course, Sasha wasn't the only Owls man on the show - Queenslander Bachelor Drew famously flew an owl in for his reveal with Sam at the start of the show and will be forever remembered as The Owl Guy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:20:31.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
