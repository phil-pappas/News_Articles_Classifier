By India.com Staff on October 9, 2015 at 10:39 AM Comments So Ghulam Ali’s concert in Mumbai and Pune is cancelled. Just because Shiv Sena did not want any Pakistani artist to perform in India or may be just in Maharashtra. The reason Shiv Sena has come up for this is quite sensitive that is expressing solidarity with the Indian soldiers. As always, the politics is being played. Once Shiv Sena stopped the Gazal Maestro from performing there were offers for him from Delhi and Kolkata. Does it mean Arvind Kejriwal and Mamta Banerjee run governments have no solidarity with the Jawans who are risking their lives at the border? Also Read- Ghulam Ali refused in Mumbai, invited by Delhi: 10 latest developments By stopping an artist who has no political motives is it the ‘only’ way Shiv Sena can show their solidarity towards the men at the border? No will be an answer from almost all corners. Even those Jawans, who are away from their loved ones, after returning from duty will be happily listening to Ghulam Ali gazals. And going by Shiv Sena logic, Indians should then delete all the Ghulam Ali gazals they have in their mobile phones or laptops. Why only his collections? Delete all those songs sung by a Pakistani singer. Stop enjoying them! All the music channels and radio stations should be directed to stop playing songs featuring Pakistani artists. Also, command YouTube to ban Coke Studio Pakistan in India. Yes, boycott all Pakistani artists! Everything that entertains and is of Pakistani origin. Also Read- Ghulam Ali: I will keep coming back to India Will that really help? No that won’t. These artists already have no political affiliations. They are here to perform and enthral us. We love to listen to them. We pay to see them perform. An average Indian will have no problem in listening to the soothing voices of singers like Ghulam Ali. There is always a peaceful way to register your protest. Fearing the backlashes (read the history of Shiv Sena protests) the organiser eventually decided to cancel the show. It was not Ghulam Ali alone who would have benefited from the show, the organiser too who is an Indian as well. May be the organiser is not as ‘patriotic’ as Shiv Sainiks. \n  10:48 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:48:16.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
