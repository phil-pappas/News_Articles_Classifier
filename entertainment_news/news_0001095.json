The song starts with an impressive guitar work, and then moves on to energetic vocals by Anirudh. While the tempo is maintained quite stylishly, the violin solo adds a different texture making the song more likeable. It is sure to top the charts. Neeyum Naanum is a breezy melody packed with powerful vocals by Neeti Mohan and Anirudh. The best part of the song is that the background tune, especially the piano work, and the vocals by Neeti, merges quite seamlessly instead of overpowering one another. The tune, too, sounds different from the usual Anirudh style. The lyrics by Thamarai need a mention as she beautifully pens a romantic number.\nYennai Maatrum Kadhale by Sid Sriram and Anirudh has a mild Rahman touch. It solely relies on Sid's voice, and he carries forward the song quite effortlessly. With a westernized tune to go with it, this song has been well-composed by Anirudh, who has moved away from his comfort zone. This is followed by the title song rendered by the energetic Benny Dayal. Trust him to sing this type of a song and he has done a commendable job in giving it a different flavour. With the sax giving a rock feel, this one's definitely one of the better title songs we have heard in the recent past. The album ends with an unusual combination, Kannaana Kanne by Sean Roldan and Anirudh. With both their music being a tad different from each other, this combination itself makes the song work. Sean has rendered the song well as the tune sounds more like his type of song. Anirudh is totally upping his game through this album, which sounds fresh, unlike his last few albums. The composer who created a sensation with 3 is well and truly back!
