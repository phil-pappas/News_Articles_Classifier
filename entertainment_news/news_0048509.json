(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The founder of the global News Corp. media empire, Rupert Murdoch, is suggesting that President Barack Obama isn’t a “real black president.” \nMurdoch was praising Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and his wife on Twitter Wednesday evening when he wrote: “Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide?” \nLater, Murdoch recommended a New York magazine article asking whether Obama has done enough for the African-American community. \nMurdoch is the founder of Fox News Channel, and News Corp’s publications include The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal. \nThe 84-year-old Murdoch has praised Carson on Twitter before, calling him “irreproachable on background, achievements, character, vision.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:39:10.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
