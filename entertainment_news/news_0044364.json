Congratulations, to Richard Williams, of Allentown, PA, our latest winner! Richard, the Sweepstakes Winner, has won an all-expenses paid European Union Patent. \n\"We're really glad to make this announcement,\" said Scott J. Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing and Desa Industries Inc. \"We had a huge number of entries for this sweepstakes. A lot of our inventors were definitely interested. And no wonder, the European Union is a large affluent market. Of course inventors want to be able to sell inventions there. Richard is the big winner.\" \nEuropean Union Patents, like their counterpart, the United States Patent, offer legal protection for registered patented inventions for a limited time. They prevent third parties from copying and/or selling the patented invention. A European Union Patent generally applies to over 25 countries in the European Union. \n\"Richard has a great idea,\" said Cattya Bella DuBois, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing Reviews . \"When he came to us and said, 'I want to patent my idea,' we knew that this is the kind of product that really does have worldwide appeal. So of course, he needs to be looking towards Europe as well as Latin America and Asia. It's all part of the process. Way to go Richard, I'm so glad you won.\" \nWorld Patent Marketing Sweepstakes Winners in the past have won prizes such as 10,000 World Patent Marketing Dollars that can be spent developing and preparing invention ideas for the licensing or retail market, and breakfast on a luxury yacht with CEO Scott Cooper.
