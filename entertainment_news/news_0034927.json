This means the smooth rapper's birthday lands on the first day of the Scorpio astrological sign. Let's take a look at how right this is.\nScorpio is the most sensual and passionate of the astrological signs, and Drake may be the most sensual of the popular rappers. I mean, just read these lyrics from \"Best I Ever Had.\"\n  Know you gotta roommate,/Call me when there's no one there,/Put a key under the mat and you know I be over there... You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice. \nDo you feel that? It's Drake's sensuality, and it's unavoidable.\nVideo: Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" Video Takes Over Twitter! The 28-year-old rapper does insane dance moves in his new music video and it's blowing up on social media! Check it out!\nMedia: San Francisco Chronicle When it comes to money and success, Scorpios set goals and stick to them. They don't give up. Did Drake give up after his character on \"Degrassi: Next Generation\" got shot in the back and he had to spend the rest of the series in a wheelchair? No. He wheeled that wheelchair around the set and kept acting, like a winner.\nDid he give up when people thought he was too soft and Canadian to be a rapper? Not Drake. \nI done kept it real from the jump/Living at my mama's house we'd argue every morning/ I was trying to get it on my own/ Working all night, traffic on the way home.... Started from the bottom now we're here. \nThe rapper has now won a Grammy, sold an estimated $10 million albums worldwide, popularized the acronym YOLO and, most recently, nerd-danced his way into the heart of social media (check that out in the video above).\nThe takeaway? Scorpios are deep and intense people. Drake is 29 years old, and we're happy he's rapping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:27:01.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
