By Mary Carr Mayle T heodore Boyd has been a welder with Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems for five years, but his career spans three decades and includes other high-tech local manufacturers JCB and Great Dane.\nAfter a hot day of intense, precision welding, most people would welcome the opportunity to go home and relax with a cool beverage. Not Boyd.\nHe’s paying it forward by heading to Savannah Technical College and his night job as an adjunct professor, teaching a class in welding and joining.\n“I want to be a role model for young people,” he said. “There are very good jobs out there if you apply yourself. I have found a successful career, and I love doing what I do. It is my duty to reach out to youth to get them motivated and let them know there are a lot of things you can do with your life.”\nThat’s exactly the type of adjunct professor Savannah Tech president Kathy Love values.\n“I’m sure Mr. Boyd could find something more relaxing to do after working all day,” she said. “But his enthusiasm, real-world knowledge and precision skills are just what our students need.”\nSavannah Tech is all about staying on the cutting edge of precision manufacturing, Love said, especially when it comes to local industry.\n“Broad, theoretical knowledge is important to have, but it’s almost impossible for our full-time instructors to know everything that is going on in the ever-changing world of high-tech local manufacturing.\n“For that, we rely heavily on adjunct professors who come to us directly from local industry,” Love said. “Not only can they teach material that is related to what they do for their employer every day, they can make sure we are training on the right type of equipment, giving our graduates the experience and familiarity that will transfer directly to the job.”\nBoyd said he wonders whether students realize how lucrative a certified, precision welding job can be.\n“Welding is an honest way to make decent money,” he said. “My experience motivates me to push others. I’m having fun teaching, and I’ve also helped my students find jobs at Mitsubishi.”\n‘Everyone benefits’\nIt’s that “win-win” aspect that makes the use of adjuncts so important, Love said.\n“Our students benefit from the up-to-date, right-now experience, while area manufacturers benefit from potential employees who are trained in and aware of their requirements.”\nBrian Vogel, an equipment/controls technician for energy giant Kinder Morgan at its Elba Island site, is teaching an industrial systems technology course at Savannah Tech called programmable logic controller or PLC.\n“On a personal level, I anticipated that instructing students in the fundamentals of PLC’s would be both a challenging, yet rewarding experience,” he said. “On a professional level, Kinder Morgan utilizes this equipment in numerous applications. Developing a trained workforce at the local level benefits not only our company but potential employees within the community as well.”\nSteven Heard, director of LNG operations for Kinder Morgan, said his company paid Vogel’s tuition to take the course when he first came to work for them.\n“When Savannah Tech approached Brian to help educate students on PLCs, we were happy to accommodate,” Heard said.\n“This opportunity provides training for potential future employees of Kinder Morgan. It also further develops Brian’s technical, communication, and leadership skills, which will benefit him and Kinder Morgan in the future.”\nVogel said it’s been gratifying to see students develop their skills.\n“When a student enters a course at an introductory level and advances to making programming changes, it provides a level of satisfaction,” he said.\nOne of his most pleasant surprises has been his students’ strong desire to learn, Vogel said.\n“Many are in a stage of their life where they want to improve themselves in a meaningful way, and they use that motivation to absorb as much knowledge as possible,” he said.\n“I’ve been fortunate enough to receive specialized training in the field to advance my own career, and hope to pass that knowledge on to others now through my position at Savannah Tech.”\n‘Affecting lives’\nEddie Cockman has been teaching cabinetmaking at Savannah Tech for five years and plans to continue to teach when he retires from Gulfstream Aerospace in the near future.\n“I like teaching, really,” he said. “I’m glad I have a craft, something to give to the students.”\nFor Cockman, the most gratifying aspect of his job is seeing his students go on to get jobs.\n“I got a report on a recent Gulfstream hire, and she’s doing quite well,” he said. “I’ve been at Gulfstream for almost 25 years, and it’s good to see someone new come in and get a job — a career — that affects their lives.”\nCockman learned his craft at an early age.\n“My daddy was a carpenter; I’ve been a carpenter all my life,” he said. “I started out working in residential cabinet shops and had lots of diverse jobs in the carpentry industry. That helped me when I got to Gulfstream.”\nAs much as his students learn from him, he learns from them, he said.\n“I see students from all walks of life that have never been on a table saw — it teaches me patience,” he said. “Seriously, I’ve seen the different ways people learn. If you try to teach everybody one way, you’ll lose a lot of people. Each individual has a different story, and you have to be able to diversify based on their skills. I try to help each one.”\nCockman is currently teaching his students how to work with aluminum honeycomb and fiberglass panels, an important aspect of cabinetmaking at Gulfstream.\n“Even if someone comes from a carpentry background, they don’t usually work with these materials,” he said. “If I get someone from the traditional carpentry industry, I have to show them how that translates to aircraft. It helps Gulfstream.”\nAmy Ariano, vice president of human resources for Gulfstream, echoed Cockman’s sentiments.\n“At Gulfstream, we value our relationships with local education partners that help us build our talent pipeline. The partnership with Savannah Technical College gives us a great opportunity to bring Gulfstream experts directly into the classroom,” she said. “We get to teach students the skills they need today to establish careers in the aviation industry, and they, in turn, help us grow our workforce.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14814752.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14814903.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14814778.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14814903.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14814907.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14814907.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14814752.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14814778.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:14:04.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
