He will relaunch it next spring, moving to a new location, and there’s still a chance that he will open a Las Vegas outlet. But the more surprising news is that he’s announced plans to end tipping at his 13 New York City restaurants. \nIt has set off a furor of questions from New York to Las Vegas as to how much more expensive his dining experiences will become. The reason? He’s hiking menu prices by 21 to 25 percent to give workers across the board a pay raise. \nForbes quickly estimated that diners will pay 10 percent more for their total meal cost so that all employees are compensated “equitably, competitively and professionally” based on their work. \nSaid Danny: “We believe hospitality is a team sport and that it takes an entire team to provide you with the experiences you have come to expect from us. \n“Unfortunately, many of our colleagues — our cooks, reservationists and dishwashers, to name a few — aren’t able to share in our guests’ generosity, even though their contributions are just as vital to the outcome of your experience at one of our restaurants.” \nThe new non-tipping and increased menu charges will begin in November and take a year to roll out at his full-service restaurants. It remains to be seen if the new policy will be applied here in Las Vegas, but already this morning chefs are abuzz about its implementation. \n“Maybe we will all have to follow suit?” said one chef. “We have to watch the reaction and results before we jump in the same way. Maybe it just won’t play in Las Vegas.” \nRecently, when I interviewed chef restaurateur Thomas Keller celebrating the 11th anniversary of his Bouchon at the Venetian, he talked about the move afoot to abolish tipping in California and instead have a set service charge: \n“We eliminated tipping at French Laundry in 1998. I made the mistake of starting Per Se with a tipping pool, then we eliminated that in 2006. Those restaurants do really well with a service-charge element. Would Bouchon in Las Vegas, would a casual-dining restaurant do well with that element? I would hope so. \n“I think that the guest needs to realize that he’s in a better situation if he’s not paying the staff. I am certainly in a better situation if I am paying my own staff because I can train them. I can give them the benefits I want. \n“As a waiter who’s making minimum wage and relying on his tips, the gratuity, they can’t have the same kind of benefits that my other staff has because they don’t have necessarily the income as it relates to the income on their check. \n“Nor can they sometimes control their income. It’s a sad thing to say. I think it’s a good thing if we move away from tipping altogether. So when you go to France or Europe, Americans have no problem not tipping. \n“In America, I’m not sure why guests feel that they have to control what my employee makes or doesn’t make. It’s the strangest thing. This is the only profession that has that kind of situation. It’s just bizarre.” \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
