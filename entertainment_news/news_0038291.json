Illustration: Simon Letch \nLet me say I'm not Julius Sumner Miller, despite being something of the man's doppelganger. Possibly the nearest I get to the physicist of chocolate fame is the hair. Or maybe his catchphrase: \"Why is it so?\" Though that's likelier to be a question issuing from my solvers, rather than my own lips.\nBack at school I did what science was necessary. I made a volcano. Collected lichen. Sliced open a bullock's eye. I tried to memorise the top 50 elements, when all the while my brain was making words like K-Ni-Fe and UNiCoRnS.\nNonetheless a residue stuck, like grains of sand that layer sedimentary rock. Despite my daydream tendencies, I've retained the basics of photosynthesis and convection. Just don't quiz me on Hooke's Law of elasticity. Or wait, was he the gas bloke?\nPhysics in general is my blackest hole. After years of playing pool, I know the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, unless you put extra work on the cue ball. Even now, a light year since school, I'm unsure whether Schrodinger's cat needs a sardine or a shovel.\nAdvertisement Given that shortfall, I'm prone to blundering on the science front. Before I call an urchin an echinoderm I need to double-check the dictionary. (It is.) To make a clue for syzygy, I must align my facts. Regardless, I can still call an ohm a unit of power (try resistance, Einstein), or an oarlock a fulcrum.\nThe clue was a Quick clue from last week: Fulcrum for a rowing blade (7). For the record, my colleague DH had posed the definition, though I've succumbed to similar wording in the past. Dave Ringland, a Newcastle solver, felt the need to object.\n\"I beg to differ,\" he wrote. \"The rowing cycle represents a second order of levers in which the fulcrum is in fact at the blade end of the oar in the water. The load is the combined weight of the boat and rower (concentrated at the oarlock) and the effort is the drive needed to propel the boat forwards. The rowlock is not the fulcrum.\"\nRowlock. Oarlock. Whichever term you choose, most dictionaries I've checked, before and since Mr Ringland's email, have cited the all-important f-word in their definition. Here's the Collins: \"a swivelling device attached to the gunwale of a boat that holds an oar in place and acts as a fulcrum during rowing.\"\nOr the cox of lexicons, the Shorter Oxford: \"a device, usually consisting of a notch, two thole-pins, or a rounded fork, on the gunwale of a boat, forming a fulcrum for the oar in rowing.\" So which rowlock party is actually speaking bollocks? Or is the fulcrum role adaptable through a single regatta? Is Dave Ringland off-course, or did DH & crew make a rowing blue?\nKeep in mind the Oxford has form in this department. Five years ago, a physics lecturer from Queensland University of Technology noticed an error on the page. Dr Stephen Hughes alerted the Oxford to the fact that a siphon relies on gravity to operate, rather than atmospheric pressure, as its definition asserted. Seriously, any petrol thief knows that basic. Amazingly the boo-boo had been embedded for almost a century.\nIndeed, many dictionaries had fallen prey to the same siphon furphy. As Margot Charlton, an Oxford spokesperson, had explained to Dr Hughes, \"The OED entry for siphon dates from 1911 and was written by editors who were not scientists…\" The database was revised, and good science was restored.\nWhich leaves us with our rowlock dilemma. Did the Oarsome Foursome lever off the river in Barcelona, or their scull? Or both? Like a rower, I'm looking backwards at my wasted lab years, desperately trying to make headway in these troubled waters. If only I was science-savvy. If only I didn't realise that five chemical symbols go to spell SiPHON…\ndavidastle.com \n@dontattempt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:32.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
