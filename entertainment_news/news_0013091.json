Starz officials could not be immediately reached for comment.\nA merger would mark another step in Lionsgate's evolution from being a lightweight entertainment company to a major industry player.\nThe company, based in Santa Monica, California, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions over the years, including the rights to the blockbuster \"Hunger Games\" film series.\nThe premium pay-TV network Starz is owned by billionaire John Malone. A merger with Lionsgate would open up wide programming possibilities for the company.\nStarz stocks went up 10 percent to $43 in Monday's after-hours session while Lionsgate shares went up nearly eight percent to $42.19.\nMergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers Arts & Entertainment Starz Lionsgate", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:24:48.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
