We caught up with him at the Daley Center Farmers Market where he told us that five years ago he was growing 2,000 to 3,000 Brussels sprouts plants. This year? He's grown 40,000 plants, with the stalks of sprouts going to several farmers markets and chefs.\nIf you've never purchased sprouts on a stalk. Stover has a few tips:\nPick off only what you want to use then store the remainder in the refrigerator or garage. \"That will keep them moist.\" When choosing which sprouts to remove, work from the bottom to the top or vice versa. \"That way you'll be cooking sprouts that are all the same size and density.\" Mountains of Brussels sprouts Photo by Judy Hevrdejs Kenny Stover suggests cutting only the sprouts you plan to use off the stem to keep the remaining Brussels sprouts moist.\nKenny Stover suggests cutting only the sprouts you plan to use off the stem to keep the remaining Brussels sprouts moist.\n(Photo by Judy Hevrdejs) Stover expects to be harvesting Brussels sprouts until close to Christmas. \"They don't mind a hard freeze,\" he said. He cooks them on the grill after cutting them in half and tossing them with olive oil, salt and pepper. (If his wife is cooking, she adds garlic.) Wrapped in foil, he grills them over medium heat 7 to 10 minutes.\nHere's how we do Brussels sprouts without a grill (or when we're time crunched): Cut sprouts in half then microwave on a plate with a splash of water for 2 minutes. Toss on a foil-lined baking sheet. Add wedges of yellow onion and sweet pepper and crushed garlic. Drizzle everything with olive oil. Sprinkle with favorite seasonings. Roast at 400 to 425 degrees until the vegetables' edges start to brown. You can add small potatoes (about the size of a large egg) to the mix. Prick with a fork and microwave with a bit of water 2-3 minutes just until they're barely soft when pressed, then add to the baking sheet with other vegetables.\nNeed something a bit more holiday oriented? Here's a recipe from the Chicago Tribune's files for roasted Brussels sprouts with dried cranberries from Chicago freelance food writer Laura Levy Shatkin.\nMost area farmers markets end or move inside at the end of October.
