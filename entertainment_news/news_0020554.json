It didn't make me mad, it just really bummed me out. We're really honoring those movies.\" \nPaul Feig, who is directing the reboot, had a similar experience after the film was announced. Feig told Variety in March that Internet commenters wrote \"some of the most vile, misogynistic s-- I've ever seen in my life.\" \n\"I figure it's some wacked-out teenager,\" he said of the Twitter commenters. \"But almost constantly it's someone who's bio says 'Proud father of two!' And has some high-end job. You're raising children and yet you're bashing me about putting women in my movie?\" \nKate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones will star along with Wiig in the new \"Ghostbusters,\" which hits theatres July 22, 2016.
