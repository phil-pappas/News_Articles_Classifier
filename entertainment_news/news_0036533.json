CUT OUT THE FRONT\nBegin at the head of the bath and use painter’s tape to mark the cut straight in from the lip then diagonally down to about 150mm above the foot. Make sure the baseline is parallel by measuring from the top of the tub rather than the base.\nUse an angle grinder to cut inside the tape marks. “If you’re not handy with this tool ask a handyman or builder to do it for you and request they round-over the edges so they’re not sharp,” says Natasha.\nNATASHA’S TIP When you’re marking out the cut, start wide at the top where the bath curves, making the opening wide enough to sit in, while supporting a sofa cushion along the base.\nRepurpose a claw foot bath tub into a luxury vintage-style sofa with paint and some cushions of course!\n2. ADD THE DESIGNER COLOUR\nClean the bath so it’s free of debris, position drop sheets inside and tape around the edges to prevent overspray. Ensure you have good ventilation and work outside if possible.\nApply spray paint in a bright colour, following the label instructions. “This Cherry Red is a rich red colour similar to the original cushions in the movie,” says Natasha.\nNATASHA’S TIP Hold the can upright, moving it back and forth as you spray. It’s best to apply lots of thin, light coats to build up the intensity of the finish, leaving each coat to dry thoroughly.\n3. MAKE IT COMFORTABLE\nCut and shape foam to fit snugly into the base, upholster it then add cushions. If you’re not handy with a sewing machine, simply fold the fabric around the foam like wrapping a gift and use double-sided fabric tape to hold it underneath.\nNATASHA’S TIP Mixing colours and textures adds luxury. For the sofa I used blue velvet, with floral cushions of soft linen and silk and a splash of yellow.\nNatasha Dickins is the White Knight Campaign Creative Director.\n DIY project: Turn a bathtub into a sofa", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/350138-08bdfa76-68c9-11e5-9095-42e6eb04e048.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/how-to-turn-an-old-bathtub-into-a-sofa/story-fneuz5ql-1227554299978"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:19:09.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
