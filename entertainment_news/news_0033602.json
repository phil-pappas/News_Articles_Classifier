How about murderous North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un?\nAn anonymous artist/provocateur known as \"Smear Leader\" made the connection when it was discovered Monday that he defaced the famous Cosby mural at Ben's Chili Bowl eatery by plastering a picture of a buffoonishly grinning Kim over Cosby's face.\nSomeone put a sticker of Kim Jong Un’s face over a mural of Bill Cosby outside the Ben’s Chili Bowl! Eek #DC pic.twitter.com/Z7nnqmSqMv\n— Sunni (@SunniAndTheCity) October 19, 2015 And talk about the power of the press: Just a day before the Washington Post ran an opinion column in which a Washington publicist named Devin Boyle called for the removal of the mural as a message that violence against women, even alleged violence, should not be ignored.\n\"The task at hand is to move on from this moment and paint over our complacency and the pain it has caused,\" she wrote. \"Let’s start over. Let’s spend our weekend drawing a new mural that celebrates women.\"\nSmear Leader took up the cause. On Instagram, where the satirical artist posts his handiwork slapping pictures of Kim in the most unlikely places, he put up a picture of what the mural at the venerable U Street restaurant looks like now.\nINSTAGRAM\nSmear Leader (@smearleader) * Instagram photos and videos\n\"Kim's Chili Bowl,\" the post read. \"Instead of looking at a sexual predator, people can celebrate in jubilation that the great leader is now on the their Wall.\" Then it added a directive to Cosby that we can't publish.\nWho is Smear Leader? According to the Daily Beast , he's a tall, thin, bald Banksy-like figure whose day job is in marketing. He's mass-produced copies of his original drawing of Kim and then uses wheatpaste to stick them up wherever he thinks he can make satirical points.\nAs the Washington Post reported, it's unclear whether the stick-up will cause permanent damage to the mural, painted in 2010 on outside wall of the restaurant.\nBill Cosby mural at Ben's Chili Bowl is clandestinely refaced with a grinning Kim Jong-un.\n https://t.co/uw5W3FsKrn pic.twitter.com/d6kVXYY48Q\n— DCist (@DCist) October 19, 2015 The Ali family that owns the restaurant has declined to remove the mural or cut off longtime friend Cosby, who is one of two people (President Obama, also featured in the mural, is the other) who is allowed to eat free at the restaurant.\nMural featuring Bill Cosby at Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington, D.C., in December 2014. (Photo: JIM WATSON, AFP/Getty Images)\nThe family, which has not yet commented on the defacement, has continued to back Cosby during this past year of toxic media coverage of the resurfacing of accusations that Cosby drugged and raped more than 50 women in episodes dating back decades.\nCosby's career is over, his reputation is toast, he's lost scores of gigs and honorary degrees, he's facing a half-dozen civil suits and even the remote possibility of criminal charges arising from the accusations.\nUSA TODAY\nEddie Murphy burns Bill Cosby during his Mark Twain Prize acceptance speech\nAnother mural featuring Cosby in Philadelphia has been removed, and a bronze bust of him was unceremoniously carted away from a prime spot at Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park in Florida in July.\nBut up until Monday Cosby's face was still smiling from the west side of Ben's Chili Bowl.\nApproving tweets of Smear Leader's Cosby artwork commenced immediately.\nIt took a minute, but someone finally defaced the Ben's Chili Bowl Cosby mural.
