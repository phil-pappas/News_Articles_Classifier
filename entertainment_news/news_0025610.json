Well, it looks like she knew exactly what she was doing.\nThe show, which premiered in India tonight, had all the right twists at the right places. In fact, if you loved Claire Danes’ Homeland, think of this as a fast food version of it, one that’s addictive.\nAlso Read: Critics hail Priyanka Chopra's performance in 'Quantico' \n\nPriyanka Chopra plays Alex Parrish, an FBI recruit. The show starts with her finding herself in the middle of an explosion at Grand Central Station. She is questioned by the FBI about her classmates at the Quantico academy. The show then flashbacks to her time in training, and that’s where we meet interesting characters. Though she is implicated in the crime, she manages to escape. Her mission now is to find the real terrorist.\nWhat we liked right away is that Chopra doesn’t carry an unbelievable American accent, neither does she have an Indian accent that seems out of place in well, the FBI academy. In fact, she sounds refreshingly ‘normal’. She also enjoys a romp in a car, slipping up black panties unapologetically in the first five minutes of the first episode. All without fuss.\nRead Story: Priyanka Chopra: I was sceptical to sign 'Quantico' \nOnce she is at the academy, it’s like being at high school. Her classmates are all eye candy; perfect for any TV show. We like that one of them is openly gay, and training to be an agent. Once the characters are introduced, the show progresses at a good pace. A classmate shoots himself and another has a twin living with her! Now, all the show needs is to maintain the momentum.\nThe best bit (we agree with NYT) is Chopra, who comes across as a confident and seasoned actress. You don’t see a star, but a character, much like we did in Barfi!\nWe are tuning in next Saturday for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:43:24.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
