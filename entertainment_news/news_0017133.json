Working off of experience gained through his own practice, the author explained that, while there are certain biological differences that make female procedures different than male procedures, some of the biggest differences are the attitudes that each gender tends to bring towards their procedures. According to Los Angeles plastic surgery medical group Beverly Hills Physicians, the two most valuable points made by the article are when discussing how male and female patients communicate with their doctors, and when talking about the number of procedures that each gender may seek.\nDoctor-Patient Communication – In the article, the author explained that he experienced several instances where male patients didn’t seem particularly receptive to instructions to rest and take things easy while recovering from a procedure. Beverly Hills Physicians says that while, in their experience, both their male and female patients are good at following doctor instructions during their recovery, they do take note of a recent study that showed female patients often have an easier time describing to their doctors what they hope to get out of their procedure. The study, which focused specifically on male and female rhinoplasty procedures, implied that men tend to have a slightly lower satisfaction rate with their rhinoplasty procedures, most likely due to the fact that male patients and doctors are less likely to be on the same page before the procedures. Yet, BHP explains that this problem can be remedied with a highly attentive and thorough surgeon who is committed to appropriate communication with patients. Number of Procedures – While the number of procedures that a patient seeks may not be directly tied to gender, the article notes that it is often more common for female patients to opt for multiple procedures rather than men. With their own patients, Beverly Hills Physicians explains that many of the male patients who come to them for a procedure do so to get a single “problem” fixed, such gynecomastia (overly large male breasts) or a nose they feel is overly crooked or too big. Female patients, on the other hand, tend to adapt an attitude of constant self-improvement. Beverly Hills Physicians explains that female patients may plan out their procedures for a long time, and may begin planning for the next procedure once they have fully recovered from the last.\nMale or female patients who are interested in learning more about any and all of the procedures that Beverly Hills Physicians offers can call them today at 800-788-1416.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/BHP/Gender/prweb13023476.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://cosmeticsurgerytimes.modernmedicine.com/cosmetic-surgery-times/news/surgical-nuances-male-patient?page=0,0", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/BHP/Gender/prweb13023476.htm"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:20:08.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
