Do you think the Seattle Pubic Library should be renamed The Seattle Public Libraries? Do you like the current name just fine? One way or another, you can help.\nA little background: This summer, the library put out a request for a proposal to develop a brand strategy. The library cited a need to “properly convey to our patrons, staff, donors, volunteers, and advocates that the Library is not only still relevant to the community, but is integral, innovative and invested in fulfilling its mission successfully.”\nThen the library solicited patron input with a survey that asks, among other things: Which name do you prefer, the Seattle Public Library or the Seattle Public Libraries? Patrons are asked to vote on three logos (which all feature the name Seattle Public Libraries). Then various media outlets got wind of the fact that the library is paying the firm Hornall Anderson $365,000 to come up with the strategy. The fee is being paid with private money from the Seattle Public Library Foundation.\nThe ensuing uproar has provoked this note of explanation from City Librarian Marcellus Turner.\nWhat do you think? Here’s the survey link – for more on the library’s thinking, click here . The survey will remain up through Sunday Oct. 11.\n \nMary Ann Gwinn : mgwinn@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @gwinnma .
