It's a huge amount of investment, a huge amount of time, but really worth it,\" Edward Fuller, general manager at Madame Tussauds London, said.\n\"This is the first time that anybody can get up and stand close and get personal with every single one of their favorite Bonds.\"\nThe museum said Connery, who was the first to play the secret agent in \"Dr. No\" in 1962, is portrayed as he appeared in \"From Russia With Love\".\nGeorge Lazenby stands as 007 in his only Bond film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". Roger Moore is featured from \"The Spy Who Loved Me\".\nTimothy Dalton is portrayed as he was in his two Bond films \"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence to Kill\", while Pierce Brosnan is represented from \"Tomorrow Never Dies\".\nThe figure of Daniel Craig, who stars in the highly-anticipated \"Spectre\", is from the last 007 film \"Skyfall\".\n\"Spectre\", the 24th James Bond film, is set for release in UK cinemas on Oct. 26 and in the United States on Nov. 6.\n(Reporting By Holly Rubenstein; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian ; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:36:49.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
