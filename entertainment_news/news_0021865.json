We're very excited about this show, which has broken a lot of records and really revolutionized magic.\" \nAngel said he starting working on this show 10 years ago. \n\"It's been an immense amount of work,\" he said. \"I've been working on it, evolving it, transforming it, ever since.\" \nAngel said he was always interested in creating a magic show, but didn't want to do something that \"we've seen time and time and time again, like these other shows that are more like magic variety shows.\" \n\"I wanted it to be something that was much more spectacular,\" he said. \"Something that was much more artistic. Something that boasts the most revolutionary illusions and escapes ever performed on a stage. It took me 10 years to evolve and transform those thoughts into real-life demonstrations and a show that would be an experience unlike anything else.\" MORE : 11 creepy, crawly critters to see at the Philadelphia Zoo before Halloween \nThe show — which features nine of magic's best artists — was written well before Angel even knew who was going to be performing the illusions he was creating. \n\"I wrote the show before anybody was involved,\" he said. \"I created the show sitting in my backyard.\" \nHe then \"scoured the globe\" for the best in the trade. \n\"I got artists from as far as South Africa to Paris, France, to Colombia, to Spain and Mexico, and of course, the U.S.A.,\" Angel said. \nHis team of magicians includes Landon Swank — a finalist from \"America's Got Talent\" — Krystyn the Femme Fatale of Legerdemain from Angel's show \"Believe\" at the Luxor Las Vegas; Banachek, a mentalist and producer of \"Mindfreak;\" Spencer Horsman who has been described as the Houdini of our day; Stefan Vanel the Manipulator; Adrian the Street Magician; Johnny the Dog Conjuror, who has an uncanny ability to understand canine behavior; The Great Maestro, a Kung Fu World Champion and a regular in \"Believe\" at the Luxor, \"Mindfreak,\" and the \"Believe\" television show; and Fifi the Joker, Maestro's magic assistant. \n\"When I brought them in, I said, 'Hey, if you're interested in doing something that's never been done before, great. Let's take your talent and let's cultivated it and sculpt it and transform it into something that will be the future of magic today,'\" Angel said. \nHe said the cast represents the \"best of the best in their specific category in the art.\" \n\"I was able to assemble each of these people and put them together in a show that really took magic, I think in a lot of ways, to the next level because the illusions that are in there are not the illusions that we've seen time and time again in other magic shows,\" he said. \"We're doing things that have a much cooler, much more pop culture sensibility, that will still appeal to children and to families and to all ages. It's magic catapulted into the day and age that we live.\" \nAngel became \"obsessed\" with magic after his aunt taught him a card trick when he was 6 years old. \n\"I got into magic really heavily when I was about 10 or 11,\" he remembers. \"I started performing at birthday parties and private functions, and then went on to start creating my own material and trying to create my own look, and my own approach and presentation of magic.\" MORE : WATCH: Papa Roach, Pop Evil talk favorite horror flicks at music festival \nIn those days, Angel said he had \"big dreams,\" but never imagined his art would take him to where he is today. \n\"Honestly, what has happened to my life, and what I have been able to accomplish, is really beyond my wildest dreams,\" he said. \"It's just crazy. My dreams have gone beyond my wildest expectations, and that's why I wanted to create a platform for other really talented magicians to have the opportunity that I didn't have, and to give them a platform to shine.\" \n\"The Supernaturalists\" show is all about positivity and believing in the impossible, and Angel wants each audience member to leave feeling empowered. \n\"I think the biggest thing that I want people to take away is, magic deals with the field of the impossible, showing that anything is truly possible when you believe,\" he said. \"We live in such a negative — technologically sometimes — world where people live in fantasy land all the time and they spew negativity out or people are bullied. That drama is something that I don't like in my life and I try to bring positivity into the world.\" \nHe wrote the show in the hopes that the illusions and magic would show guests of all ages that, \"when you put your mind to something and you focus, anything is truly possible.\" \n\"I think it empowers people and gives people hope and positivity,\" Angel said. \"And it shows that what's in my heart, in my DNA, lives in this show, and hopefully spreads to the people who watch it so that they can leave there thinking, 'Hey, you know what? I can accomplish becoming a doctor or a lawyer or an actor or a singer because I've seen these nine incredible artists, coming from all parts of the world, believing in what they do and seeing them shine and living their dream. And I think I want people to walk out of there feeling like they can live their dream. They can be empowered.\" \n\"The Supernaturalists\" will appear at 3 and 8 p.m. on Oct. 17 at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. \nFor more information, visit thesupernaturalists.com . \nKelly Roncace may be reached at kroncace@njadvancemedia.com .
