By Stephen FitzGerald. MUP. $34.99. Photo: supplied \nHe begins his narrative as a diplomatic cadet in the early 1960s, when he's peremptorily told to learn Chinese, the language of an outlaw country. He does so at RAAF Point Cook, among Anglo China-watchers in Hong Kong and then in China, where he gets a taste of the brutalities of the Cultural Revolution. He recognises the unsustainable delusions of successive conservative Australian governments which have conned Australians for years into believing Chinese Communism is a ruthless predator set on dominating Asia and beyond.\nAdvertisement He leaves an inward-looking and Anglo-centric foreign service for academia and becomes a research assistant to opposition leader Gough Whitlam. He goes with Whitlam and Mick Young to China on what appears in 1969 to be a politically risky trip, but which is made immensely rewarding by a meeting with Zhou Enlai. When Whitlam becomes prime minister in 1972, FitzGerald, at 33, is his natural choice as Australia's first ambassador to Beijing.\nWe had two wartime ambassadors accredited to the Chinese nationalists in Chungking and Nanking, but the Chinese have no collective memory of Australia and FitzGerald feels that developing relations is like reconnecting the nerves, veins and arteries of a severed limb. His efforts are strongly reinforced when Whitlam visits again with a 70-strong entourage in October 1973. This sets the course for a rapidly developing relationship. \nLike other Australian ambassadors in similar hardship posts, FitzGerald faces the challenges of running a mission in a hostile environment; how to keep staff happy and engaged, deal amicably with their Chinese colleagues, adjust to loneliness. He appoints a health officer, rotating the position among the staff. He gets support from visiting Canberra-based colleagues and goes to Pyongyang where he is jointly accredited until the North Koreans unexpectedly close their own mission in Canberra in October 1975 and send Australians in Pyongyang home.\nFitzGerald survives Whitlam's dismissal in the same year, and stays on under his successor. Malcolm Fraser and his foreign minister Andrew Peacock visit. The Chinese like Fraser's public expressions of concern about an expansionary Soviet Union, but reject his suggestion, accidentally leaked to the press, for a four power arrangement to contain the USSR - China, US, Japan and Australia.\nIn July 1976, Gough and Margaret Whitlam come back for another look at China. In Tianjin they experience a major earthquake, and Margaret gashes her leg when a wardrobe falls on her. Undeterred, the couple move on to Manila where this reviewer, then deputy head of mission in Manila, escorts them on an unforgettable journey as guests of President Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos to the Romualdez home town of Olot in Leyte. \nFitzGerald returns to Canberra, resigns from Foreign Affairs and becomes both an academic and a restless commercial China trader. Aggressively elitist, he chairs a new Asian Studies Council. He is invited to write a report on immigration and consults more widely in the community than his colleagues expect. He finds many antagonistic to immigration, especially from Asia. He calls for a policy based on democratic principles, and tangles with Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who thinks he is against multiculturalism, even immigration, and calls for enmeshment with Asia.\nDespite the June 1989 Tienanmen massacre FitzGerald remains a champion of China, but reflects that we have gone from seeing it as a monster during the Cold War to being infatuated, often to the neglect of other Asian countries. He sees many Chinese officials as greedy, cynical and manipulative who treat Australian openness with contempt.\nBut he continues to campaign against Asian sceptics through his   short-lived Asia-Australia Institute and other academic forums. He castigates Howard for his sly racism, Rudd for his deceptively superficial understanding of China, and Gillard as an innocent abroad, happier in a school classroom than at an international conference. He notes the deeply conflicted approaches of recent Australian policy papers on defence and foreign policy, especially towards the United States and China.\nHe is deeply scathing of Abbott who plays to a domestic grandstand, but who attempts from ignorance to ingratiate himself to Asian leaders when it suits him. He concedes that Bishop is an articulate and plausible foreign minister, but suggests that beyond consular and transactional matters she makes no contribution to advancing Australia's independent standing in world affairs.\nComrade Ambassador is compulsory reading for Australians who want to capture the seismic foreign policy changes of the Whitlam era. Whitlam shook Australia out of its complacency, and FitzGerald helped him do it towards China.  \nRichard Broinowski is a former Australian diplomat and current president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in NSW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:20:16.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
