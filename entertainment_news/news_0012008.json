(Photo: Courtesy photo) \nTonic Sol-fa is doing some things it’s never done before. \nThe a cappella group with roots that go back about two decades to Collegeville has released its first album as a trio, “Original.” With the help of a Kickstarter campaign, Greg Bannwarth (tenor and vocal percussionist), Shaun Johnson (lead vocalist) and Jared Dove (bass) put out a piece of work that means a great deal to them. \n“We’ve been proud of other CDs before, but this is the one that I think we are most excited about,” Bannwarth said. “I feel that we finally got to the point of being able to be as creative as we want to be. We worked with all kinds of amazing people.” \nIndeed, just because Tonic Sol-fa is now a trio doesn’t mean the work starts and stops with the three men. The group collaborated with various engineers, producers, even a rapper to craft “Original.” (To scout for the latter, Dove went down a list of Midwestern rappers he found on the Internet. “Most of them laughed us out of the room, but we got a few takers,” he said.) \nThe album is a mix of original work and standards, including about half holiday songs. Tonic Sol-fa arranged all the music. As cliche they admit it could sound, they said they simply wanted to do something they were proud of and hoped that fans would be happy with it. \n“It was a lot of different things going into this album that were either going to work for us or against us, but we’ve been getting a lot of good feedback,” Dove said. \nJohnson was one of the first members of Tonic Sol-fa (specifically, the fifth). The demands of the group whittled its numbers down. \n“You were suddenly faced with a few hundred shows; people had girlfriends and wives and families,” Johnson said. “Facing that prospect, right away there was a lot of changeover.” Johnson noted the album title is funny considering none of the three were part of the first Tonic Sol-fa group. \nLike a family, continuing to evolve \nStill, Bannwarth, Dove and Johnson have been together for about 15 years, with St. Cloud as their home base. The group has regularly done shows at the Paramount Theatre for the hometown crowd. Johnson recently sold his St. Cloud home, though, and Bannwarth and Dove live in the Twin Cities. It’s not clear what Tonic Sol-fa’s future holds, aside from continuing to try to push the boundaries they tested with “Original.” \nWhat’s the group’s secret to staying together so long? \n“You just build that relationship where it does get to be like family, and you put up with certain things, and ultimately it’s for the better good. I think you enjoy more things about each other than you dislike about each other,” Dove said. \nAlthough they occasionally have their spats, the three go to their respective corners and get over it, he said. \nTonic Sol-fa’s vice president, Michelle Massman, has been with the group for that time, too. \n“It’s very interesting to work with this group of gentlemen. They are all very genuinely wonderful people.” (Long pause.) “And sometimes they act like seventh-graders,” she teased. \nTrying to evolve has helped the group stay solid, too, Bannwarth said. \n“We always have different ideas, different plans that are on the horizon, some that pan out, some that don’t, like any business, but while you’re working towards it, that’s the thing that continues to keep it exciting,” he said. \nTonic Sol-fa members tried to write more as a group this time, something they found invigorating. \n“Anytime that we get to sit together and not worry about the day-to-day business things that are going on and you just get to be creative together, that’s why we got into this in the first place,” Bannwarth said. \nThe three men are also trying other methods to stir their creative juices, including taking voice and even dance lessons. \nOf the dance lessons, Johnson said some find the idea of Tonic Sol-fa taking them silly, but they help the three feel more in tune with their bodies while on stage. \n“We’re not going to go up there and start doing crazy dances — who knows, we might,” he joked. \nKickstarter help, fan appreciation \nThe a capella genre has seen some of its public image change drastically in recent years, with its newly prominent place in pop culture thanks to successful franchises such as “Pitch Perfect.” That certainly doesn’t hurt Tonic Sol-fa. \n“It gets our foot in the door,” Dove said. “Anything that doesn’t cast it in a negative light per se is always good for us.” \nAnd Tonic Sol-fa may fit into the a cappella niche, but it’s collaborated with instruments over the years, too. \nTonic Sol-fa raised more than $10,000 through Kickstarter to make “Original,” featuring contributor incentives such as getting to sing on a song with the group or getting an early preview of the album. \nIn the future, the group may release a single at a time online instead of waiting to fill an entire album. Fans always want music faster, and that way Tonic Sol-fa could get more immediate feedback. \nAnd it is all about the fans. After all, they helped the group members create the type of album they wanted to make. \n“You couldn’t ask for better fans than what we’ve had over the years,” Bannwarth said. “We’ve been able to build Tonic Sol-fa with different people along the way, but what it comes down to it, you wouldn’t be anything without people that are going to buy your music, that are going to buy your tickets, that are going to be just awesome in general.” \nFollow Kate Kompas on Twitter @copygirlkate, or call her at 259-3620. \nHear ‘Original’ \nGo to http://store.tonicsolfa.com to buy the album; songs also available on Spotify and Pandora. \nIf you go ... \nWhen: 7 p.m. Dec. 28, Dec. 29. \nWhere: Paramount Theatre, 913 St. Germain St. \nTickets: Adults $24, seniors $23, children 12 and younger $12.
