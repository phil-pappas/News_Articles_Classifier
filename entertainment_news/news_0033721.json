Luthmann joins \"Democrats for Illuzzi\" and other noted local Democrats including Allen Cappelli in crossing party lines to endorse Joan Illuzzi, a professional prosecutor with twenty-seven years of prosecutorial experience to become Staten Island's next District Attorney.\nStaten Island, New York (PRWEB) October 24, 2015\nOn the heels of the endorsement by the New York Daily News , Staten Island Democratic County Committee Member and \"Trial By Combat\" Lawyer Richard A. Luthmann has endorsed Joan Illuzzi for Richmond County District Attorney. Luthmann joins notable Democrats including Allen Cappelli in crossing party lines to endorse the professional prosecutor with twenty-seven years' experience.\n\"In the wake of our community's heroin epidemic, I must in good conscience support Joan Illuzzi, the District Attorney Candidate with twenty-seven years' prosecutorial experience to become Staten Island's Chief Law Enforcement Officer, \" Luthmann said. He continued, \"I have had occasion to meet Joan Illuzzi and examine her impeccable record in law enforcement. She is a prosecutor, not a politician. Staten Island needs someone tough as nails to fight the heroin scourge that is destroying our community. Joan Illuzzi is the woman for the job.\"\nLuthmann continued:\" It's a free country , and I have never been someone who will 'go-along just to get-along'. I think Joan Illuzzi's prosecutorial experience makes her the qualified candidate to tackle our community's heroin epidemic.\"\nBased on past Staten Island Political History , Luthmann expects Illuzzi to win on Election Day: \"I wasn't old enough to vote in the 1995 Staten Island District Attorney's Race , but many who were there - including Allen Cappelli - see many parallels. I believe Staten Island voters will once again pick the candidate with a resume that includes decades of law enforcement experience. On November 3, that person is Joan Illuzzi, Staten Island's next District Attorney.\"\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13040589.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/08/09/city-lawyer-demands-to-settle-civil-case-with-trial-by-combat/", "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/08/nyregion/election-1995-overview-molinari-loses-race-for-district-attorney-staten-island.html", "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-illuzzi-staten-island-da-article-1.2409312?cid=bitly", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761858318", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13040589.htm", "http://blog.silive.com/politics/2009/04/strictly_political_for_april_1.html", "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/joan_illuzzi_gets_endorsement_1.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:44:03.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
