After both couples danced again it was over to the judges and they all agreed that Ainsley and Natalie were going home. \nTalking about his experience Ainsley said, “It’s been absolutely amazing. I’m sad that it can’t continue but I made a couple of mistakes and the judges are spot on, they know exactly what they are talking about. I’m sad for you Natalie I really am. I wanted to push on a little bit more but it wasn’t meant to be.” \nNatalie added, “I think you are one of the loveliest men I’ve ever met. What you see is what you get with Ainsley. From the people in the street to the judges, everyone speaks so highly of you and you are such a gentleman and you’ve been a dream to work with. I’m sorry we couldn’t go further. We have had a lot of fun in rehearsals.” \nBryan Adams stopped by to perform during tonight’s results show and a pro group dance kicked things off. \nStrictly Come Dancing 2015 continues at 6.35pm on Saturday.
