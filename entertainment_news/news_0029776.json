It’s here!\nOct. 21, 2015: The date on which Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown landed after time traveling in the second installment of the “Back to the Future” film trilogy.\nOr you can look at it as the date that filmmakers pondered when they tried to imagine what the world of the semi-distant future – our time – would be like.\nHere, let’s see how they did.\nLook up. See any flying cars?\nOK, that one didn’t quite pan out.\nBut pick up your phone and talk to a friend on FaceTime or Skype. Video calls! Nailed it!\nAnd that’s not all. Garbage-fueled cars? Glasses that double as computers? The Cubs playing meaningful baseball in October? The movie made more than a few lucky/clever guesses.\nSo, today, as theaters prep to show the “Back” trilogy, as fans gather in Los Angeles to start a five-day celebration called “We’re Going Back” – and anybody lucky enough to own a DeLorean is likely to get mobbed – we went to sort out “Back” facts from fiction.\nAnd, along the way, we’ll clue you in to a few ways to celebrate the big day.\nTHEN AND NOW\nThen and now: See what 'Back to the Future' locations look like 30 years after the movie\nHOVERBOARDS\nWhen Fox as Marty McFly arrives in Hill Valley on Oct. 21, 2015, he is totally stoked to find that skateboards have shed their wheels and become hoverboards.\nOur ruling here is fiction, though in recent years a few companies have demonstrated prototypes of boards that “hover” using magnetic levitation. But these work only over metallic surfaces, so they’re more gimmick than reality.\n1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Related: Then and now: See what 'Back to the Future' locations look like 30 years after the movie Get your 'Back to the Future' horoscope from 1985 30-year anniversary of 'Back to the Future': O.C.'s Danny Botkin preps his DeLorean time machines DeLorean is back from the past Paging Marty McFly: New phone case defies time", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/time-669197-future-botkin.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/phone-651580-bandai-case.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/movie-688468-see-years.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/delorean-525841-car-future.html", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/nwk4nt-screenshot20151020at11.28.08pm.png", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/future-688474-horoscope-.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:32:39.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
