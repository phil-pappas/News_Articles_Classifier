This is largely because much Australian drama is best viewed with an open mind, an open heart and an open bottle of wine.\nThen every now and again (more agains in recent years, thank heavens), along comes a show that demands to be regarded with a serious eye. This occurs far less than you might think – most shows applauded as great are, to be honest, usually a wee bit shy of that.\nThe shining exceptions included  Heartbreak High  and  Wildside , which brought their worlds to viewers with overpowering truth.  Blue Murder  was simply compelling.  Underbelly  was too, just, though it lives, as most crime dramas since have, in  Blue Murder 's shadow.  Love My Way ,  Cloudstreet ,  Tangle ,  Wentworth ... OK , now we're on a roll. so there are quite a few.\nTo that list we can now add  The Beautiful Lie  (Sundays, ABC1, 8.30pm), an ambitious and elegant reworking of Tolstoy's  Anna Karenina  into a contemporary Australian relationship drama.\nAdvertisement As a concept it might sound a little like reworking  The Iliad  into  Getaway , but the result is as astonishing as it is compelling: a gorgeous, velvety drama that will be re-watched and discussed for years to come.\nYou often can't get a proper sense of the most brilliant television dramas until they fall out of the sky (called, \"Oh my god, duck, here comes episode two\" syndrome).  Heartbreak High  might have been  Neighbours  were it not for elevated writing and an intangible spark that transformed it. Ditto  Love My Way,  which brilliantly shattered television dialogue-speak and gave its characters a more truthful way of expressing themselves. The Beautiful Lie  excels because it reaches high and manages to take that giant step up.\nThe casting is thrilling – Sarah Snook and Benedict Samuel are brilliant, ditto Rodger Corser – and also a little adventurous. Slotting the usually comic Gina Riley into a serious role is a gamble that pays big dividends.  Doctor Who  made the same discovery with Catherine Tate. Why more drama producers don't do it is a mystery.\nIt also reveals something of the alchemy between producers John Edwards and Imogen Banks. The pair also collaborated on  Offspring ,  Tangle  and  Puberty Blues , three dramas noted not just for their unique voice but for their near-unrivalled excellence. Like most spells, though, it is ruinous to try and explain the science behind it, so it's best to simply accept that the result is magic.\nAnna Karenina  is one of those great works of literature everyone has had a crack at. An old black-and-white film with Greta Garbo and Frederic March✓ is rattling around somewhere. A BBC version from the 1970s starred Nicola Pagett and Eric Porter, who was frankly better as Soames in the original  Forsyte Saga . Another with Helen McCrory and Kevin McKidd might have ended up in the history books had McKidd not ended up racing off some nurse in the dispensary cupboard on  Grey's Anatomy .\nThe Beautiful Lie  will never be regarded the definitive  Anna Karenina  because it is a personal, intimate, modernisation rather than a direct dramatisation of the original work. And yet it deserves to be. It is so crisp in the execution and so honest in its emotions – wildly passionate, reflective, regretful, intensely driven – that it is difficult to look away from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:11:25.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
