The film earned only $20.5 million from 52 markets.\nUnlike Disney's largely profitable foray into live-action fairy tale adaptations, \"Pan, \"starring Hugh Jackman, Rooney Mara and newcomer Levi Miller, might find Warner Bros. taking a write-down for their losses. Only time and the promise of an Oct. 22 China opening will seal \"Pan's\" ultimate fate, but it already has the dubious distinction of being one of 2015's biggest bombs, up there with Disney's \"Tomorrowland\" and Fox's \"Fantastic Four.\"\nIn honor of the rare, fascinating spectacle of the box office bomb, here are some of Hollywood's most infamous financial catastrophes.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/21/05/8458583/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/22/55/7940948/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=entourage.htm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/30/06/8487351/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/25/8783196/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/02/04/00/540726/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/46/24/8021251/8/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/30/06/8487351/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.newstimes.com/entertainment/article/Remembering-Hollywood-s-biggest-box-office-6566831.php", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/57/47/8059353/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/21/05/8458583/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/22/55/7940948/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sinister2.htm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/31/8549997/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=weareyourfriends.htm", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxX_bVluflo", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/45/66/8281533/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/26/8783262/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/77/8757221/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/31/8549997/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/26/47/03/5927127/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=witherspoonvergara.htm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/44/04/8536322/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/44/04/8536322/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/45/66/8281533/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/10/26/8422807/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/02/04/00/540726/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/71/76/8101772/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/10/26/8422808/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/52/04/5939469/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=crowe2014.htm", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=uncle.htm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/10/26/8422808/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/26/47/02/5927076/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/75/04/2609470/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/11/75/04/2609470/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/26/8783251/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pixels.htm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/26/47/02/5927076/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/25/8783175/4/920x920.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fantasticfour15.htm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/25/8783175/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/66/51/8350283/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/77/8757221/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/52/04/5939469/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/66/51/8350283/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=newlinehorror2015.htm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/26/8783251/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/26/47/03/5927127/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/25/8783216/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/71/76/8101772/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hitman47.htm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/26/8783262/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=1952.htm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/57/47/8059353/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/10/26/8422807/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/25/8783196/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/46/24/8021251/8/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/25/8783216/4/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:22:13.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
