Rick Ross, Wiz Khalifa, Jeremih and YG \nbring verses from the States, whereas Ed Sheeran, Skepta and Emeli Sande bring the distinct British flavours, and there’s even an illustrious appearance from the legendary Jamaican reggae/ska vocalist Derrick Morgan. Share article \nCasyo 'Krept' Johnson and Karl 'Konan' Wilson, two school friends from Croydon, have gone from spitting bars in the schoolyard to sharing verses with Rick Ross and Wiz Khalifa. \nTickets can be secured by visiting budweiserliveproject.co.uk Promoted Stories MOBO nominees to play free Southampton gig Sorry, an error occurred.
