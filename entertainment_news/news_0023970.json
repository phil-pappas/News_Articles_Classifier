The demonstrators moved on after about 10 minutes.\nShanice McBean, 22, was among the protesters who said the stunt was meant to re-ignite the feminist spirit of the movie by spotlighting violence against women.\n\"We're here to say to say that it's great that women's history is being shown in the film, but that the struggle is not over,\" said McBean, from London, who is currently unemployed.\nEmma Fischer, 27, a teacher from London, said the protesters organized by a group called Sisters Uncut condemned cuts by Britain's conservative government to the budget for domestic violence services such as refuges for women.\n\"With two women killed a week in the UK due to domestic violence cuts, there's no way we can stop fighting,\" she said.\nNo one from the film, that opened the BFI London Film Festival and is set for a U.S. release later this month, was immediately available to comment about the protest.\nThe protest startled some of the film's stars but others backed the demonstration that prompted police and extra barriers along the red carpet and delayed the screening by 15 minutes.\nInterviewed by Sky News at the premiere, Bonham Carter said the protest was the \"perfect\" response to the film.\n\"I'm glad our film has done something. That's exactly what it's there for,\" said the actress who, ironically, is the great granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith, a key target for the suffragettes at the time.\nOscar-winning Streep has said it is \"infuriating\" that the film-making industry continues to be male-dominated.\nThe film shows how the authorities are shocked as the women's civil disobedience rises and sparks debate across the country while the women involved risk their jobs, homes and children to fight for women's right to vote.\nFinally, in 1918, a limited number of women in Britain were first given the right to vote - those aged over 30 who met a property qualification. It was not until 1928 that all women over 21 were allowed to vote, achieving the same rights as men.\n(Editing by Belinda Goldsmith.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
