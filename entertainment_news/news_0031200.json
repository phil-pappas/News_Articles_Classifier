All of these albums have been remastered at Abbey Road and will be available on heavyweight 180gm vinyl.\nThis incredibly prolific and pioneering period is seen as one of the greatest in rock music history, as SIMPLE MINDS went from predominately post-punk, glam roots ( Life In A Day ) through innovative Krautrock and dub-inspired studio experimentation ( Real To Real Cacophony )– described by Bobby Gillespie as \"really hard European disco\" ), into a fascination with European culture, with the influence of the likes of Neu! and Kraftwerk feeding into their third album, Empires and Dance , in just a mere two years. Exploring the use of sequencing, more progressive, textured soundscapes, soundtracking a lyrical journey through European culture and politics, Empires and Dance 's industrial sound was to prove ahead of its time, pre-empting later works by the likes of Cabaret Voltaire.\n1981's Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call was the band's first release on Virgin Records. The release was, in fact, two albums, with the latter initially included as a limited bonus disc and later released as an album in its own right. Working with producer Steve Hillage , the band created the perfect symmetry between their previous album and elements of prog rock, which, bar fellow imaginative artists such as Magazine and PiL, many of their contemporaries were still willfully dismissive of. Following exposure to a much wider audience, thanks to a Peter Gabriel tour support, the single 'Love Song' was an international hit. Both albums were to prove a massive influence on the dance revolution of the '80s and '90s, particularly Sister Feelings Call 's \"Theme For Great Cities,\" which proved so enduring, the band re-recorded it as a B-side 10 years later.\n1982's New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) was the album which began the band's crossover as a major force in the pop music of the decade, reaching no.3 on the UK album chart. Working with producer Peter Walsh , the band was able to realize the sophisticated, accessible pop sound – whilst continuing their quest for experimentation – they were striving for. This achievement was reflected in three incredible and successful singles: 'Promised You A Miracle,' 'Glittering Prize' and 'Someone, Somewhere (In Summertime)'. The album even included a guest appearance from the legendary jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock ('Hunter and The Hunted').\nOriginally released in February 1984 , Sparkle In The Rain was Simple Minds' sixth studio album and, following 1982's crossover album New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) , the one to cement their commercial success, giving them their first UK number 1 (as well as a top 20 album in Australia , Canada , Germany , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland ). The album went on to be certified double platinum in the UK. The illustrious lyrics and the political and personal love songs were matched by throbbing synth-beats and piano flourishes, dominating new wave guitar chimes and swooning bass lines. Kerr's song writing thrived on the band's striving amidst a new emerging sound and direction. The album cemented Simple Minds' reputation as one of the major bands of the 1980s and prepared the groundwork for the worldwide hit album ONCE UPON A TIME .\nThere's no doubting the lasting, cultural impact of these albums, from the time of their release during the birth of the new wave electro scene in the late 1970s, through the dance scene of the '80s and '90s, to the music of the Manic Street Preachers and the recent sound of The Horrors' Skying album, making them five of the most vital albums of the post-punk period and the last 35 years.\nOriginally released in October 1985 , ONCE UPON A TIME became Simple Minds' most successful album to date, selling two million copies in two months, hitting the top spot in the UK and making the top 10 in America. It spawned four top 20 singles and launched a fifteen-month-long world tour that kept Simple Minds' name in the music weeklies for most of 1986. With Jimmy Iovine and Bob Clearmountain providing a production dream team, and Anton Corbijn contributing to its instantly recognizable artwork, then ONCE UPON A TIME had all the attributes of a classic 1980s album.\n\"Alive And Kicking\" was the obvious first choice of single and its release preceded ONCE UPON A TIME by a month. The new sound, artwork and video indicated what was to come and whilst the single reached the same chart position as its predecessor in the UK, it just slipped short of the top spot in America, stalling at number three. But ONCE UPON A TIME easily eclipsed SPARKLE IN THE RAIN when released in October 1985 , shifting two million copies in two months.\nIn support of the album, Simple Minds undertook their longest and biggest tour yet, beginning in the USA in October 1985 (kicking off at Poughkeepsie on the 31 st ) and visiting mainland Europe , the UK, the USA again (now with The Call as support), Canada , Japan , Australia and New Zealand . This included a series of massive outdoor summer concerts at Ibrox, Milton Keynes Bowl and Torhout-Werchter. Their first three top 10 singles from the album were signposts detailing the progression of the tour, and the fourth, Ghost Dancing , was released as the tour wound up, all profits being donated to Amnesty International. As Simple Minds took a well earned rest, after years of relentless writing, recording and touring, Virgin released the lavishly packaged LIVE IN THE CITY OF LIGHT , a massive live souvenir of ONCE UPON A TIME recorded over several nights at Le Zenith in Paris , which earned them their third successive UK number one.\n\"When I think of our most complete albums,\" said Kerr. \"I would say NEW GOLD DREAM (81,82,83,84) is definitely a complete album – it just feels very complete to me from start to finish; and I don't think I'd change anything on ONCE UPON A TIME and I wouldn't change anything on BIG MUSIC . They, for me, are the most complete albums. Someone might say 'Don't You (Forget About Me)' should've been included; and when you think about it, leaving it off is rather eccentric thing to do - you wouldn't get away with that now. It would've sold double the amount of copies though! But it's very complete: the artwork, everything about it, it is bang on.\"\nTo celebrate the 30 th Anniversary of its release, Simple Mind's classic album ONCE UPON A TIME will be released on December 4th as a standard CD and a 2CD Deluxe Edition. The remastered standard edition contains the full original remastered album, including the singles \"Sanctify Yourself,\" \"All The Things She Said\" and the timeless \"Alive and Kicking.\" The 2CD Deluxe edition features the full original remastered album, as well as 13 single mixes, B-Sides and alternate versions, four of which have been previously unreleased.\nTrack by track and liner notes featuring new interviews with Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill available on request.\nTHE VINYL COLLECTION 79-84\nLP ONE - Life In A Day\nSIDE ONE\nSomeone\nLife In A Day\nSad Affair\nAll For You\nPleasantly Disturbed\nSIDE TWO\nNo Cure\nChelsea Girl\nWasteland\nDestiny\nMurder Story\nLP TWO - Real To Real Cacophony\nSIDE ONE\nReal To Real\nNaked Eye\nCitizen (Dance Of Youth)\nCarnival (Shelter In A Suitcase)\nFactory\nCacophony\nVeldt\nSIDE TWO\nPremonition\nChangeling\nFilm Theme\nCalling Your Name\nScar\nLP THREE - Empires And Dance\nSIDE ONE\nI Travel\nToday I Died Again\nCelebrate\nThis Fear Of Gods\nSIDE TWO\nCapital City\nConstantinople Line\nTwist / Run / Repulsion\nThirty Frames A Second\nKant-Kino\nRoom\nLP FOUR - Sons And Fascination\nSIDE ONE\nIn Trance As Mission\nSweat In Bullet\n70 Cities As Love Brings The Fall\nBoys From Brazil\nSIDE TWO\nLove Song\nThis Earth That You Walk Upon\nSons And Fascination\nSeeing Out The Angel\nLP FIVE - Sister Feelings Call\nSIDE ONE\nTheme For Great Cities\nThe American\n20th Century Promised Land\nSIDE TWO\nWonderful In Young Life\nLeague Of Nations\nCareful In Career\nSound In 70 Cities\nLP SIX - New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)\nSIDE ONE\nSomeone Somewhere In Summertime\nColours Fly And Catherine Wheel\nPromised You A Miracle\nBig Sleep\nSomebody Up There Likes You\nSIDE TWO\nNew Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)\nGlittering Prize\nHunter And The Hunted\nKing Is White And In The Crowd\nLP SEVEN - Sparkle In The Rain\nSIDE ONE\nUp On The Catwalk\nBook Of Brilliant Things\nSpeed Your Love To Me\nWaterfront\nEast At Easter\nSIDE TWO\nStreet Hassle\nWhite Hot Day\n\"C\" Moon Cry Like A Baby\nThe Kick Inside Of Me\nShake Off The Ghosts\nTHE VINYL COLLECTION PACKSHOT/EXPLODED:\nhttps://www.hightail.com/download/bXBZTkZvYXlFc0lFSzhUQw\nhttps://www.hightail.com/download/bXBZTkZvYXk4aU9Ga2RVag", "external_links": ["http://smarturl.it/VinylCollec7LP", "https://www.hightail.com/download/bXBZTkZvYXlFc0lFSzhUQw", "https://www.hightail.com/download/bXBZTkZvYXk4aU9Ga2RVag", "http://smarturl.it/UponATime2CD", "http://smarturl.it/UponATime", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150324/184009LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:16:46.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
