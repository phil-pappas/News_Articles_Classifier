The median list price for Broadview homes is $757,000, while the median sale price is $550,000, according to the last 90 days of sales data from Redfin. Take note that two of these homes are in Broadview while the third is farther inward in Haller Lake.\nThese three homes range from $409,950 to $2.49 million.
