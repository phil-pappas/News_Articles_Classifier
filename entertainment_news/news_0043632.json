But instead of birthday wishes being sent to Asin, we guess she got more phone calls and messages to congratulate her on her wedding date being finalised. Rumours were rife that Asin and beau Rahul Sharma, the founder of Micromax, were getting married on November 26 – exactly a month from the Scorpio actress’ birthday. But it seems the wedding will take place in 2016. \nA report in The Times of India states that Asin has denied her wedding date is November 26. The Ghajini actress says, “It’s really funny to see all these false dates about my wedding being thrown about. I am completing my assignments and contracts till the end of this year and post that only will there be a wedding. So, please wait for an announcement from me.” \nAsin has clearly hinted at a 2016 wedding, so we guess preparations must be on now at both ends! Asin and Rahul met through their common friend, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, and sparks began to fly between the two. Asin and Rahul soon formed a close bond and later came out about their relationship. \nWe wonder what birthday presents Rahul is giving to Asin, now that they are soon to be man and wife!
