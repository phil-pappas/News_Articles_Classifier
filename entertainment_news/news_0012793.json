No one knows it better than Ilan Stavans, a professor at Amherst College.\nMiguel Cervantes Saavedra (1547-1616) published Don Quixote of La Mancha in two parts, in 1605 and 1615. We thus mark the 400th anniversary of the book’s complete publication as well as, a few months ago, the authentication of its author’s grave. In Spanish, the book is referred to as El Quijote ( The Quixote ), the use of the definite article connoting affection, familiarity and singularity. Stavans adopts the Spanish title throughout. Twenty translations have appeared in English (the first, in 1612, by Thomas Shelton); the most acclaimed is by Edith Grossman (2003).\nQuixote takes the form of a cultural history as it unfolds over four centuries. Stavans gives a detailed account of El Quijote ’s reception in the West and its influence on countless writers, intellectuals and artists. He considers a wide variety of images inspired by its characters and episodes, including the iconic silhouette of Don Quixote and Sancho by Picasso, the former gaunt, with armor, lance and shield, on his emaciated steed Rocinante, the latter plump, on his donkey, Rucio.\nAn image that is more suggestive though not as achieved artistically is Gustave Dore’s engraving Don Quixote in His Library . Stavans also includes illustrations of a goodly number of Quixote tchotchkes from his extensive private collection.\nEl Quijote recounts the adventures of Don Quixote, a hidalgo — a member of the lower nobility — whose days are spent reading novels of chivalry, a popular literary form in 16th-century Europe. These stories so inflame his imagination that he undertakes a series of delusional adventures with his “squire,” the peasant Sancho Panza. Quixote, following the chivalric tradition, serves an idealized, unreachable noblewoman, Dulcinea del Toboso, who is in actuality a commoner, Aldonza Lorenzo. She is truly unreachable because she never appears in the story.\nThe Spanish Empire, the largest and wealthiest in the world at that time, was declining in Cervantes’ day. The great time of La Convivencia, the peaceful cohabitation of the Iberian peninsula by Christians, Jews and Muslims that led to a great cultural flowering, had ended in 1492 when Ferdinand and Isabella forced Jews and Arabs to either convert to Catholicism or leave Spain. Under Philip II, Spain suffered defeat by England following the destruction of the Armada and a series of bankruptcies.\nStavans persuasively makes his case for El Quijote ’s being regarded as the greatest novel of the Western canon. Che Guevara modeled his life on it. Freud learned Spanish so he could read it in the original. Setting aside all of the philosophers, critics, artists, composers and filmmakers who have been enthralled by the novel, and looking only at great fiction writers who have praised and imitated it, we arrive at quite a list: Borges, Crane, Dostoevsky, Faulkner, Fielding, Flaubert, Fuentes, Goethe, Hawthorne, Irving, Kafka (who argued that Sancho was the real protagonist), Marquez, Melville, Sterne and Twain.\nStavans singles out Borges for providing “the most important rethinking [of the book] on this side of the Atlantic.” He wrote an essay of more than 500 words on the first six words of El Quijote ! More important, Borges’ short story “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote ” (1939) allows Stavans to develop his original concept of “Menardismo,” which contributes greatly to critical discourse on the novel.\nThe story by Borges tells of a Frenchman who sets out and succeeds rewriting (not copying!) El Quijote by immersing himself so completely in Cervantes’ life and times that he reimagines the entire novel without reference to the text. The two texts turn out to be identical, word for word. Borges’ fantastical narrator argues that the two versions have the same aesthetic value and are equally original. For Stavans, Menardismo proclaims that the former Spanish colonies in the Americas, though belated culturally, produce works that are every bit as original and important as the European works that have influenced them.\nThe ancients posited three functions for literature, ut delectet (to entertain), ut doceat (to teach) and ut moveat (to inspire). This enjoyable book, a fast and fun read, informs us deeply about the novel. As such, it is a model work of criticism. It sends us back to the original work, eager and informed and moved to reread it or read it for the first time.\nTim Redman is professor of literary studies in the School of Arts and Humanities at the University of Texas at Dallas.\nPlan your life Ilan Stavans will be among the 300 authors at the Texas Book Festival, Oct. 17-18 in Austin.
