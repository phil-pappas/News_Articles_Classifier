I actually think it's kind of great right now because we're talking about women in politics and how important that is to get more women. And I think it'd be kind of a cool thing to have her be a Supreme Court justice or someone who runs for office. \n\"I think we're ready to see Elle and see what she's up to lately.\" \nMeanwhile, it was recently claimed that Reese is \"nervous\" about her daughter Ava's acting ambitions. \nThe 'Wild' star reportedly believes the 16-year-old, whose father is Ryan Phillippe, is still too young to start carving out a career in Hollywood even though her talent agent husband Jim Toth thinks she's ready. \nA source said: \"Ava has shown interest in acting, but Jim and Reese disagree about whether she's ready. Jim thinks she should go for it, but the idea makes Reese nervous.\" \nThe blonde beauty landed her first role when she was 14, but wants Ava to focus on enjoying being a teenager first. \nThe insider explained to America's OK! magazine: \"Reese feels like she lost part of her childhood because she started acting so young. She wants Ava to enjoy her teen years.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:45:59.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
