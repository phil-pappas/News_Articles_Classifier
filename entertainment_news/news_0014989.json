Discussed will be the following tentative dates: role assignment/practice, Nov. 14 or 15, 2:30 p.m. at location TBD; Union Meeting House hill practice, Dec. 12 or 13, 2:30 p.m.; creche construction, Dec. 12 or 13, 4 p.m. at Union Meeting House hill; pageant set up, Dec. 18, 3 p.m. on the hill (this will require adults with an interest in understanding the lighting system); and the pageant itself, Dec. 18 and 19, at 7 p.m. \nThe streetlights are turned off and Route 1A traffic is diverted for the pageant, performed by the children of Winterport and surrounding communities. The only speaking part is the Narrator, an adult, and the play involves live animals. \nOrganizers are looking for donations of three choir robes, preferably a color other than black or white, as replacements for the kings’ costumes; and also could use adult volunteers to help take down the lights following the second performance. \n“We would like the community to know that our family is committed to organizing this event through 2017, its 50th year. We need enthusiastic, committed volunteers to insure its success for another 50, said the El-Hajjs in their announcement. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
