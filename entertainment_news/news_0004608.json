As a result, the videotaped deposition set for Friday is still on. \nCosby will have to answer questions under oath about claims from Judy Huth, who says the actor and comedian sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in the 1970s, when she was 15. \nThe judge did order the deposition be sealed until at least December. \nEarlier this week, model Chloe Goins, who has accused Cosby of drugging and abusing her in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion in 2008, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles, seeking punitive damages. \nCopyright Â© 2015,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:36:16.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
