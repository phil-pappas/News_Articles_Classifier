A n important fact that’s easily overlooked in the flurry of reports about violent crime in Savannah is that the undermanned Metro police department is still doing good work, using the tools it has to make cases and get criminals off the streets.\nOn Wednesday, Metro detectives arrested a 21-year-old man and charged him in four commercial burglaries that occurred in the 400 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.\nBut these weren’t ordinary burglaries. Police said these businesses “sustained several thousand dollars in structural damage.” Investigators said that keys reported stolen in each incident were found in the suspect’s possession when he was arrested during another attempted break-in nearby. At 4:35 a.m. Wednesday while trying to enter an apartment near Savannah Station, also off MLK Blvd., the apartment’s occupants chased the thief away, police said. Minutes later, he was located nearby and taken into custody and charged with multiple crimes.\nThis arrest shows that good police work and citizen cooperation pays off.\nIn an unrelated case, Metro detectives made their third arrest last week in connection with a string of robberies on the southside involving citizens who were attempting to buy or sell items advertised on Craigslist.\nDetectives pieced together leads and evidence to make this arrest and are trying to determine whether the trio is connected to other Craigslist crimes, police said. Again, old-fashioned police work paid off, to the department’s credit.\nJust imagine how much more effective Metro police could be if it didn’t have 59 vacancies and every one of its 605 authorized positions were filled right now.\nIn mid-September, Metro reported 83 vacancies, but since that time, the situation has slightly improved, with 24 new officers joining the ranks since then, according to Metro police spokeswoman Michelle Gavin.\nThat’s outstanding news, although it doesn’t absolve the city’s leadership for its abject failure in addressing Metro’s excessive vacancy rate, which has been years in the making and has contributed to the community’s crime problem.\nMore officers in uniform means more officers filling patrol beats, improving police visibility and deterring crimes, like the vicious robbery of a 30-year-old man who was beaten last Monday downtown about 9 a.m. Police said the victim was walking down the 400 block of West Congress Lane, an often-travelled lane between MLK Boulevard and Montgomery Street in the popular City Market area when a panhandler approached him asking for a dollar. “As the victim reached for his wallet, he was struck, then beaten by another unknown subject,” police said. “The suspects took the victim’s wallet then fled.”\nThe victim was treated at Memorial University Medical Center for injuries that police said were “non-life-threatening.”\nThis robbery is yet another reason why panhandling is illegal in Savannah and why it’s important for citizens to report cases of aggressive panhandlers to police. According to people who either work in City Market or frequent that area, the panhandling situation seems to be getting worse. In one instance, a woman who was sitting at a table listening to live music in the plaza last weekend caught a man who was rifling through her purse, one worker reported.\nIncreased police visibility should deter such crimes. But Metro Police Chief Joseph Lumpkin still has too many unfilled positions on the force. Fortunately, the situation has slightly improved since last month.\nThe news that 65 new officers are now training at the police academy, up from 45 last month, and waiting in the wings to go to work is especially encouraging.\nFor that reason, we give city leaders a grade of D- on protecting citizens, slightly up from an F a month ago.\nOn a more grim note, the city’s ShotSpotter gunfire detection system had now recorded 4,374 cases of gunfire in Savannah (between Jan. 1 and Sept. 14) up from 4,026 shots during an earlier period (between Jan. 1 and Aug. 30). That represents a jump of 348 gunshots, or a 9 percent increase in just 17 days — an average of 20 new gunshots per day. That’s appalling and frightening.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:11:06.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
