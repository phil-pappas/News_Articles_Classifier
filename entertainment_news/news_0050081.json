Tran, a physician who practices family medicine, says she found a hard lump in her breast in 2007 while breastfeeding the couple's twin daughters, and was diagnosed with breast cancer the next year, in 2008. \n\"Ken was so strong for me. I really needed that, but you know, I knew he was stressed out too,\" Tran said on Thursday's Good Morning America . \"And when the opportunity of The Hangover came up, he really worried about [it]. He said, 'I don’t know if I should do this.'\" \nJeong, of course, took the role. Playing a Korean gangster in the movie also became therapy for the couple, whose twin daughters are now eight years old. \n\"I would ad lib, actually,\" said Jeong. \"I'm Korean and I was speaking Vietnamese in the movie and like, I say 'ga chee' and all these things to get my henchmen to get out. That's Vietnamese for 'chicken die'.\" Tran Jeong is Vietnamese, meaning \"There were these inside jokes between me and Tran,\" Ken Jeong says. \"I would sprinkle that all throughout the movie…it’s like the weirdest love letter to your wife in a very filthy movie.\" \n\"It would just make me laugh,\" Tran said. \nTran was declared cancer-free after the filming on The Hangover was complete . \nKen Jeong now stars in Dr. Ken , which premieres Friday at 8:30 p.m. Eastern on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:17:28.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
