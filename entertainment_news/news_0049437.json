Excerpts from an interview:\nTwo days of shooting left and you're going around planning the promotions for Shudhu Tomari Jonyo. Isn't that cutting it a bit too fine?\nWell, we couldn't help it. We have two days of shoot left with Arindam Sil, Srabanti and Supriyo Dutta. It was raining heavily in Darjeeling and then Arindamda got busy with Har Har Byomkesh . But there are no worries; we'll finish it on time.\nBut you should be worried at multiple levels. Three members of your cast -Mimi, Srabanti, Soham -are also starring in Katmundu, which releases on the same day and is directed by hitmaker Raj Chakrabarty.Doesn't that give you jitters?\nBut then, my film has Dev .A Puja release with Dev is a big thing. Remember that Chander Pahar too was a Christmas release and it was a blockbuster. I wish Katmundu all the luck but I am very confident about my film, which is a mainstream love story .But then, almost no film starring\nBut then, almost no film starring Dev has worked since Chander Pahar...\nNot all films that you act in or direct can be superhits, right? Hit and flops are part of one's career. Dev has had so many hits to his name that two-three films not working is nothing to worry about. As a director, it was indeed a pleasure to have a superstar like him on board. He is someone who can make the traffic stand still if he shoots on the streets. I still remember my first shot with Dev and Mimi was in the narrow lanes of north Kolkata and we had nearly a lakh people gathering to get a glimpse of him. It is fascinating to see his fan following and how he conducts himself on the sets. He even manages the crowd if needed. So from an actor, to a spotboy , to a producer, Dev dons all the hats for the film.\nTell us about STJ.\nThe film celebrates love in three different ways. The main plot revolves around post-marital romance and the other two plots are about first love. Dev has two looks in the film, one of which has him flaunting long hair, funky T-shirts.\nWeren't you suppose to do a terrorist film, Aslam, with Dev before this?\nYes, we were working on a film together. It took seven months to work on the script. It is an original commercial film. Dev went with me to Delhi too for a recce but the permissions for places where we want to shoot are not easy to come by . This one's in the pipeline.\nDespite all that you say about STJ, it is still a remake. This is the same Birsa who had debuted in Tollywood with 033.So life has finally come full circle?\nWhy can't you appreciate the fact that Birsa, who's made a film like 033 , can also make a film like STJ? I don't want to get stuck to a particular genre.In the past two years, I've realized that our industry needs two to three big hits a year and then only can a film like 033 be made. So, I thought of trying my hand at commercial mainstream films. My ultimate aim, of course, is to make a big commercial film with an original story. But we have a dearth of scriptwriters here. Those who write well are directors themselves. I am impressed by both Ajantrik and Om Shanti Om .My industry needs films like Om Shanti Om . I am 35 now and for the next few years I want to make films for the people. Maybe at 40 I can go back to directing my kind of films. At present, I want my films to work on a huge scale, the indus try to earn revenue and the exhibitors to talk about me in the same way as they speak of Raj Chakrabarty .\nBasically you need a hit to your name...\nI need two, three, four, five hits to my name.\nBut then, you were against remakes...\n(After a pause) Aboslutely!\nSo, are you eating humble pie, as it were?\nEverybody changes as they grow up. I made my first film when I was 28. I used to live in Mumbai and had that baggage when I came back. And there was an arrogance in me but all that dies down with age. I thank my producers -Mahendra Soni and Shrikant Mohta -as they gave me the courage to not give up.\nDon't you feel those you pointed fingers at you for making remakes will now laugh behind your back?\nYes, I am making a remake, but let people watch STJ and then comment. I told you there are three stories in the film, of which the main plot is the same but the other two stories are completely rewritten. There will be a paradigm shift in terms of aesthetics and looks of a commercial film.\nWho are the directors you look up to, like Ravi Kinagi, Raj Chakrabarty, in terms of commercial films?\nWell, firstly Birsa Dasgupta can direct all type of films, be it commercial or multiplex films.Secondly , I make my own films and don't look up to anybody .With due respect to everyone, I will have my signature in STJ with Dev in it. Raj is a brother and no one has backed me like him. And I respect Raviji.\nWhat has the industry taught you?\nI have realized that I am not bigger than my film. But sadly , I see that around me some people seem to be growing bigger than their films.\nLike?\nLike a Ram Gopal Varma.\nCloser home?\nMany directors, actually . Then again, that's how they want their journey to be. I don't. See, I have not come into this industry one fine morning to make films. My grandfather, my father, my brother are all connected to filmmaking. So, it is not a huge thing that I am a director, it's nothing to boast of.\nTwo commercial Puja releases have the same set of heroines, Mimi and Srabanti. Do you feel there is a dearth of heroines in main stream films?\nBang on! This is one reason we couldn't start Aslam as we failed to zero in on a fresh face to be paired opposite Dev . Script writers, script banks and mainstream heroines are three issues we have to work on. See, there are many actresses who can be part of off-beat films but for commercial masala films we have few heroines here.\nBoth Mimi and Srabanti have to promote the two films simultaneously. Are they giving equal attention to the two films, or is Raj's film hogging the limelight?\nI feel sad for them as they are continuously promoting both films. Nayikara khub buddhimoti hoy! So, I feel they are giving equal time to both. As long as they are finding time to promote STJ, I have no problem.\nWho are your friends in the industry?\nI don't have any friends in this industry . Raj is a very close acquaintance. Both Raj and Srijit Mukerji have changed the face of Bengali cinema. I wish 033 had released after Autograph... life would have been different for me then.\nYour co-directors say that you are very opinionated and have something to say on every topic.\nIt is good to have a point of view but nowadays I keep quiet. I have cut myself off from all addas. I do my work, come back home and spend time with my family and friends. As a person, I am upfront and honest and I can't pretend. So, I keep to myself and avoid mingling. That apart, I feel directors should speak little and let their films do all the talking. I am not one of those directors who are bigger than their films and my films should speak for me. Directors should be invisible.\nIs it true that you are seen almost every day at the SVF office and you drop Shrikant Mohta's name at the drop of a hat?\nFirstly, this is my fourth film with them; so isn't it natural I will be seen there? And secondly , after Jani Dekha Hobe (my weakest film so far) didn't work at the box office, it was they who showed faith in my filmmaking and I started shooting for Obhishopto Nighty . Thirdly , an adda with Shrikantda is very refreshing as I feel he understands cinema more than anyone else and we talk about so many things under the sun. I don't drop his name but I always take his permission as I feel I am not bigger than my films or my producer.\nSVF has a range of big names like Srijit, Kaushik or Raj working with them. So as a director, do you ever feel insecure in this gang of directors?\nI never thought I am inferior as a director to any of the names you mentioned. I trust my filmmaking and know where I stand. If you talk about the positioning, well, they may be ahead but as I said, I want my films to be bigger than me.\nBoth Rajkahini and STJ are from the same production house. Do you feel Rajkahini is getting more inhouse support since it is a Srijit Mukherji film?\nIn terms of box office, I don't think Rajkahini is ahead of STJ. Maybe in terms of urban anticipation, it is. Rajkahini is a more prestigious project than STJ and I accept that. But I would want my film to do big business as what finally matters is the return the producer gets from the film. The production house is putting a lot of effort in promoting both the films as the target audience is different for both.\nDon't you feel your wife Bidipta hasn't got her due? Everyone knows what a powerful actress she is.\nI do feel bad that Bidipta has still not got her due in cinema.She's the best actress I have directed. But what she can be happy about is that she is one of the most popular faces on the small screen. She has more fans and followers than many top movie stars here. The audience feels she belongs to them as they can see her at home on television every day . And she is my biggest critic.
