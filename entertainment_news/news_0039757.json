Jefferson St., tries its hand at history with “Lincoln: Inspiration through the Ages,” on view through Nov. 7. Works by about a dozen artists curated by the museum’s collections committee were pooled to romanticize our most celebrated president. \nThe exhibit’s impetus is a bronze likeness of Abraham Lincoln by the sculptor Daniel Chester French, acquired by the museum in 2014 from a local collector. The casting was commissioned by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1991 and was most likely based on the original 1916 model. French isn’t exactly a household name, but his magnum opus, Lincoln seated inside the namesake memorial in Washington, D.C., is a national — if not global — icon. \nPaul Jackson painted a facsimile of the pose, the President’s right leg pushed forward to suggest his intention to stand and address the people, in blood-red watercolor. Similar to his handling of church interiors, a spotlight beams down, as if diffused through stained glass. Eye on Art: First City Art Center has a double bill \nWith idolizing monikers like “Honest Abe,” Norman Rockwell comes to the rescue with “Lincoln the Railsplitter,” as the young Abraham, who’s just finished chopping wood, stops to immerse himself in a book, a double entrende of knowledge and scripture. \nA late print by Salvador Dali, on loan from the Vero Beach Museum of Art, is a female nude (based most likely on his wife, Gala) stranded in a landscape of gridded cubes. At the bottom of the image, Lincoln just happens to appear as a tiny, pixellated afterthought. Bill Mauldin, the celebrated post-World War II newspaper cartoonist, reprises French’s pose as Lincoln weeps in his chair at the news of President Kennedy’s death in 1963. \nThe show has a lesser aim with novelty works like Nathan Sawaya’s flat Lego blocks portrait and an enclosed case of tchotchkes, i.e., a paperweight, dolls and a glass bottle with Lincoln’s face, intended as a piggy bank. Photo film: ‘The art is not dead’ \nThere are two opening receptions of note this week. The Plein Air Painters of Pensacola’s annual show debuts at the Wright Place, 80 E. Wright St., from 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday. The Pensacola Interstate Fair’s “Fine Arts Exhibition” has its opening at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday in building 7. A catalog of awards — or in fair parlance, “ribbons” — will be presented at the opening. The exhibit runs from Thursday through Oct. 31.
