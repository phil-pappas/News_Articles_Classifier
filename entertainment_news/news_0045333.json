I don't enjoy one moment of it and I don't understand people who enjoy it. My mom and Kourtney clearly did! More power to them but I just don't relate!\" Kim continued. \"I'm not sure why I don't like the experience like others do. Maybe it's the swelling, the backaches or just the complete mind[expletive] of how your body expands and nothing fits. I just always feel like I'm not in my own skin.\" \"People just don't tell you all of the gross things that happen during pregnancy or after. Do you know you basically have to wear a diaper for two months afterwards?! LOL! No one told me that! #SoSexy,\" Kim revealed further in the post . \"Really, it is all SO worth it when you have your precious baby in the end! So for all my complaining, it's 100 percent worth it and more!\" Kim is expected to give birth on Christmas Day later this year. In a recent interview on \" The Ellen DeGeneres Show \" she opened up about some possible names for her forthcoming baby . She was quoted as telling host Ellen DeGeneres , \"I do like the name Easton, Easton West. I don't think my husband likes that name, but I do like it.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:47:53.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
