Retirement planning is important for all age groups and all classes of people. It is not only for the wealthy or old, as young adults and lower-class individuals can reap the benefits of early retirement planning just as much as anyone else.\nA brand new episode of “Voices In America,” which is hosted by none other than the legendary James Earl Jones, will take a closer look at the true importance of retirement planning, how individuals can start getting ready at various ages and stages in their lives and why it is better to start early rather than procrastinate developing a solid retirement plan. This episode will also explore the various ways of saving money, from savings and 401(k) plans to stocks and pension plans.\n“Voices In America” is an independently produced and distributed television show to individual stations across the nation for Public Television airing. It is not associated with APT, PBS or other organizations.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb12998832.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb12998832.htm"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:14:27.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
