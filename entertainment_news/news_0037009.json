During a stop Friday in Ulster County, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state would soon increase its spending on promoting the Catskills region, including a $5 million Catskills-centric advertising campaign that will launch next year.\nThe state has boosted its tourism advertising in recent years, with an aim at attracting the state's 50 million annual visitors to New York City to other parts of the state.\n\"We're using those 50 million people to say: You're here already. Take a day trip, take a two-day trip and come up north,\" Cuomo told reporters in Kerhonkson.\nIn addition to the ad campaign, Cuomo said he will host a \"Catskills Challenge\" next year, modeling it after the Adirondack Challenge his administration has held since he took office.\nLike the Adirondack Challenge, the Catskills version will feature Cuomo and state and local officials competing in outdoor activities, including various water sports and mountain biking, according to Cuomo's office.\nAlso announced Friday: $7.3 million in upcoming renovations to Minnewaska State Park Preserve in Kerhonkson, which will include a new 6,000-sq.-ft. visitors center. The project is being in part by State Parks, with $3 million coming from the non-profit Open Space Institute.\nJon Campbell Jon Campbell is an Albany correspondent for Gannett's New York outlets.
