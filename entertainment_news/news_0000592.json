University President Rev. Paul J. Fitzgerald, S.J. sent a campus-wide message Wednesday.\nCosby admitted to having extramarital relationships with several women, including some who now accuse him of sexual assault. He's never been charged with a crime.\nThe USF board voted on Friday, the same day Brown University's board revoked the doctorate of humane letters it granted Cosby in 1985. Fordham and Marquette universities have also rescinded their degrees.\nA spokesman for Cosby could not be reached immediately for comment.\nRelated Stories Brown University rescinds Bill Cosby's honorary degree Fordham, Marquette rescind Bill Cosby's honourary degrees Cosby seeks defence lawyer for Pennsylvania criminal probe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:17:22.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
