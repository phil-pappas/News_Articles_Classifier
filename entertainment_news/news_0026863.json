Donovan — whom Hanks plays — and to the son of Francis Gary Powers — the American U2 pilot who was shot down in the U.S.S.R. during an illegal American spy mission in 1960. Powers was captured, interrogated and eventually put into negotiations for a possible exchange of spies, which the film chronicles.\n“I don’t want to say that we got it all right,” Spielberg told a question-and-answer session after a Los Angeles screening of his film on Thursday night. “But we got enough of it right that they’re very proud of the movie,” he said of the family members who attended.\n“It’s tough,” Hanks said of making an historical film. Hanks was sitting beside his long-time friend and four-time collaborator. The two also made Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002) and The Terminal (2004) together. “It’s tough because the reality is, as Donovan, I’m going to say things he never said, go places he never was and do things he never did. But, inside that, there is an authenticity that you have to strive for.”\nSpielberg and Hanks’ Q&A was live-streamed to select theatres across North America after Thursday night promotional screenings. The roster of theatres included the Scotiabank in Toronto. Audience members submitted questions via electronic devices. Meanwhile, in L.A., a studio-friendly moderator asked Spielberg and Hanks his own questions before tossing in the public ones.\nWhat that meant was that the entire Q&A was controlled by Walt Disney Studios. What also happened was that the most important and relevant question was never asked. Before it reaches its climax, and its warm-and-fuzzy ending, Bridge of Spies is a stinging indictment of American mob rule. Donovan, before he became “an American hero” in the high-level negotiations in Germany with the Soviets and East Germans, was vilified for agreeing to defend an accused Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (brilliantly played in Bridge of Spies by Mark Rylance of Wolf Hall fame). At one point, some psychotic American “patriot” actually shot a gun at Donovan’s house, narrowly missing one of the lawyer’s children. But Spielberg is never asked about his criticism of America in the film — a hugely oversight.\nYet the shooting incident itself was discussed, but more as a joke. That is because he slightly exaggerates what happened.\n“The desire is that they forgive us for our shortcomings, and they forgive us for those moments,” Hanks said in general about the film’s poetic licence. “All right, the house didn’t get quite that shot up. Figurines were not exploding (as they are in the film).”\n“That’s my fault,” Spielberg admitted. “The house was shot up. A bullet did come through the window and come close to Mary Ellen, the youngest daughter. I, of course, put six bullets through the window.”\nSpielberg also recounted a amusing anecdote about fellow American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. On Wednesday at another event, Spielberg publicly asked him what he would have done, if he had directed Bridge of Spies. “Marty said: ‘Oh, I would have put 20 or 30 bullets through the window!’ ”\nWelcome to Hollywood.\nTwitter: @Bruce_Kirkland\nbruce.kirkland@sunmedia.ca\nSteven Spielberg, Tom Hanks talk about drama 'Bridge of Spies'\nBy Bruce Kirkland , Postmedia Network First posted: Friday, October 09, 2015 01:40 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 09, 2015 01:51 PM EDT\nFilmmaker Steven Spielberg and his actor pal Tom Hanks set out to tell \"the truth\" in Bridge of Spies, a drama inspired by a true-life story from the infamous Cold War tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the 1950s and ‘60s.\nTo no one’s surprise, including their own, Bridge of Spies comes close to reality but still invokes poetic licence and takes liberties with the historical record.\nSo that put Spielberg on edge when he recently showed Bridge of Spies to the three children of American lawyer and skilled negotiator James B.
