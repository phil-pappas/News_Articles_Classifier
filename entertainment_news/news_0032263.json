Gorga and Giudice appeared on the Bravo program following the first episode of the network's three-part special Teresa Checks In .\n\"Yes, who am I going to blame?\" Gorga told host Andy Cohen when asked if he holds Giudice responsible.\nTeresa Giudice and husband Joe Giudice were sentenced to 15 and 41 months, respectively, for fraud in October 2014. Gorga's comment didn't please his 43-year-old brother-in-law, who later blamed him in return.\n\"I don't know why he would blame me, but everybody's got their own opinion on things,\" he said. \"I would blame him more than anybody. Going on [ The Real Housewives of New Jersey ] and talking all the crap he talked.\"\nJoe Giudice and his wife were allowed to serve their prison terms separately on account of their four daughters. Teresa Giudice will be released Dec. 23, and the family will be reunited for a short time before Joe Giudice enters prison in February 2016.\n\"Nothing to be scared about,\" he recently told E! News about his impending prison time. \"You just go in, do your time and get out, like everybody else does. What's there to do? There's nothing you can do.
