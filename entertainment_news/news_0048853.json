His father, on the other hand, tries to draw him into the traditions of his Hindu practice. \nWhile he tries to follow the tradition with reluctance, the boy soon finds himself in another world where a trio of Hindu deities, including Hanuman -- who represents strength and valour -- are fighting a villain. The ending is an emotional one and will surely leave the audience in tears. \n\"Shorts are all original ideas. We make shorts for different reasons. Sometimes, it's because we think that the person has a potential to be a director and then we give them training. Sometimes, they have a good story to tell and we like the idea. That's the case with Sanjay. It is a special story,\" said Jim Morris, president of Pixar Animation Studios. \nPatel joined the Pixar Animation Studios in 1996 as an animator on “A Bug’s Life\". Since then he has animated on many of Pixar’s feature films, including “Ratatouille\", “Cars\" and \"Toy Story 3”. \nPatel also storyboarded extensively for “Monster’s Inc.\", “The Incredibles” and “Toy Story 2.” \n“Sanjay’s Super Team”, which shows superheroes like never before, will be released along with \"The Good Dinosaur\" on December 4 in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:40:03.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
