And that will drive you nuts if you do it in reverse.”\nIt’s tempting to look first and ask questions later, but Leo said that working out the details before house-hunting will give you a clear picture of what you can afford and how you can pay for it. Sessions with a housing counselor also can help low-income people realize that with planning, they will be able to afford a house that fits their needs.\n“It’s what they don’t know that’s hurting them,” said Leo, director of homeownership programs and program compliance officer for the Housing Council. “For example, they assume their credit is horrible and they’ll never be able to buy a house. They assume because they’re of a certain income or have a certain kind of job, they’ll never be able to get a mortgage. They’re ruling themselves out before they’re getting the proper education and answers to their questions.”\nROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AND CHRONICLE\nAffording the American dream of homeownership\nHere are some concerns common to prospective homebuyers:\nI’m paying a lot for rent and I want to see if I can buy a house. What’s the first step?\nFirst-timers and housing specialists suggest talking with a housing counseling service approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. To find one, go to hud.gov/offices .\nEach of the agencies runs similar programs. Which one you choose depends on its location, whether you’ve worked with the agency before and whether they have counselors who speak your language. You’ll get the basics at an orientation session.\nOnce you decide, the process is relatively the same at any HUD-approved service. A counselor will work with you to create a plan that reflects your needs, such as repairing your credit, helping you create a budget, building up your savings, determining how much you can afford and seeing whether you qualify for any grant. You can start the process by gathering pay stubs and developing or reviewing your monthly budget.\nThe programs basically are about helping people manage their expectations and their finances.\n“Regardless of how much money you make, managing your finances is not this gift you get when you turn 21 and you know how to budget,” said Berta Rivera, coordinator of the CASH Coach Program at Empire Justice Center. “Regardless of how much money you make, that doesn’t necessarily mean people know how to manage their finances properly.”\nHousing counseling services teach people the real costs of buying and owning a home, not to scare people away, but to help them understand what they can afford.\nCounseling is available regardless of your income.\nCan I get money to help me buy a house? There are programs that help with down payments and closing costs. The city of Rochester and Monroe County offer funds to people who meet certain criteria. The amounts may vary depending on what you make or on the assessed value of the house. There may be other opportunities, such as for veterans. Some employers, such as the University of Rochester and Rochester Regional Health, will help employees buy homes in certain areas of the city. Check with your employer’s human resources department.\nIt’s important to find out about grants before you go house-hunting, to find out whether you or your dream house qualifies and learn about any other restrictions.\nThe housing counseling agencies can help.\nWhat’s a First Home Club? This is a collaboration of a housing counseling agency, lenders and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which provides grants to qualifying first-time homebuyers. You have to make less than 80 percent of the area median income and be buying your first home.\nNot all counseling agencies are required to offer this service, but ones that do follow a standard set of rules.\nIn order to obtain a grant, you have to take a homebuyer education course.\nYou also have deposit a certain amount of money for a specified number of months into a dedicated account. The maximum is $1,875, and the savings period can range from 10 to 24 months.\nIf you meet your obligation, the bank awards $4 for each $1 you saved, up to $7,500, for a total of $9,375.\nThat money can go toward a down payment or closing costs — expenses that can often be a barrier for buyers who might otherwise qualify for a mortgage, said Philip Swetz, affordable housing solutions manager at First Niagara Bank.\nIf I’m not making much money, how can I even consider buying a house?\nBeing able to buy a house depends more on how you manage your money than on how much of it you have. Income affects the amount of a mortgage loan, but lenders also write mortgages based on the likelihood that you’ll make your payments. You’re more likely to be denied if lenders don’t think you’re a good risk.\nBanks also offer some more creative financing options to buyers who qualify, depending on their income and where they are looking to purchase, according to Swetz. Options may include financing up to the entire cost of a property, or allowing down payments as low as $500, he said. “Every client has different needs.”\nSo am I out of luck if my credit is bad? Short term, perhaps. But you can improve your credit.\nChad Rieflin, director of programs and grants at Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Rochester, has the following suggestions:\nCheck credit through annualcreditreport.com , a free service. He suggests avoiding other apparent free credit-check services because at some point they try to add fees. He said that checking your own credit does not affect your score.\nContact the reporting agencies to correct any mistakes on your credit report.\nPay down whatever debt you can, focusing on late payments and anything that has gone to collection.\nGet your on-time payment history included in your credit report.\nIf you need help with any of these steps, contact a nonprofit credit service that is accredited by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\nSome low-income people may not have a credit history, which also could hurt them when a lender decides whether they’d be a good risk for a mortgage. Empire Justice Center, which in July released a report about racial disparities in mortgage lending, encouraged financial institutions to look at other measures if a person doesn’t have a credit history.\nCanandaigua National Bank is exploring such an option, said Brian Pasley, the institution’s senior vice president and Community Reinvestment Act officer. That might mean looking at a buyer’s history of paying his or her rent or utility bills — anything that would show consistency in making payments.\nFinancial experts encourage you to get your credit in order even if you’re not in the market for a house now because you don’t know when you’ll need money for a major purchase.\nHow long would it take to clean up my credit to qualify for a mortgage or any grant? That depends on the amount and type of debt you’re dealing with, and how much you can commit to paying debt.\nWhat can I afford? Bankers stressed the importance of financial literacy to get a firm idea of what fits into your budget, and housing counseling services offer that kind of education.\nHousing counselors suggest that if you are comfortably making your rent payment, that should be the maximum amount of your mortgage. That way, you will be able to have money to maintain the house.\nHousing counselors also said that just because a bank qualifies you for a big loan, you don’t have to borrow all that money. They suggest taking a loan for an amount that will not significantly change your lifestyle or make you “house poor” in order to pay the mortgage.\nPSINGER@Gannett.com\nDRILEY@Gannett.com\nOn the web\nHere are some resources for people who want to learn how they become homeowners.\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development list of approved housing counseling agenices.
