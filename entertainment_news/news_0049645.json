In the second, the filmmaker thinks he or she already has all the answers and is determined you know the truth, too. \nIs it any surprise that the second kind of documentary is always less interesting than the first? \nUnfortunately it's the first that's in decline these days, as filmmakers of all political persuasions increasingly use non-fiction filmmaking not as an investigation but an editorial, whether it's to attack GMOs or to proselytize religion. And the results can be, at best, rather dull. \nDavis Guggenheim is a pleasant and earnest man, but he's a prime participant in this sort of op-ed moviemaking, always starting with a conclusion and then delivering a speech, whether it's on the critical state of global warming (\"An Inconvenient Truth\") or the wonders of charter schools ( \"Waiting for Superman\") . \n\"He Named Me Malala\" is his latest, and while it's hardly on a controversial subject – I don't think anyone outside of violent Islamic fundamentalism is going to argue in favor of violent Islamic fundamentalism – it's still a safely authorized, one-note rallying cry. \nCertainly his subject -- Malala Yousafzai, the teenage advocate for girls' education who ended up attacked by the Taliban – is a genuine heroine. Her courage in the face of terrorism is inspiring – almost as inspiring as her refusal to give in to hate or self-pity even after armed cowards boarded her Pakistani school bus and shot her and her friends. \nAnd there's also the nice touch of interspersing the live-action interviews with animation, done in the style of gentle water-colors and giving the film – and its harsh realities – the occasional welcome break, taking us into the world of a child. Which, it's hard to remember, Malala was during all this. \nYet she – and her story – are far more interesting than this movie wants to explore. \nFor example, Malala insists that her activism was all her idea (and not that of her politically involved father, who ran a chain of schools). And that may indeed be true. But the film doesn't really challenge that, or push beyond her \"every child deserves an education\" speeches to explore her quiet, serious support of Marxism. \nThe movie also goes awfully soft on the contradictions in Malala's world view and her repeated statements – echoing her father's – that the Taliban distorts Islam's vision of equality. \nDoesn't Guggenheim find it odd that, even as she's agitating for equal educational rights, Malala still accepts unquestioningly that she can't wear the Western clothes her brothers do? Or enjoy the same social independence, even though the family now lives in England? \nIsn't it strange that although she and her brothers speak English, her father – a teacher, remember – never bothered to teach her mother? How far does real equality go, in Malala's house? Or even in this film? (Guggenheim spends a lot of time interviewing Malala's goofy kid brothers, yet mostly ignores their mother.) \nMalala's a smart, brave, charming young teen. Guggenheim obviously admires her. So why does he think a girl who faced down a gun barrel can't stand up to a provocative question or two? \nWell, because this is the sort of movie he almost always makes: A lot of sincere attention paid to a single issue, without ever introducing any questions that might even momentarily distract from that issue. A lot of serious nods, and headshakes, and sympathetic clucks, and urges to get involved. \nAnd an ending that comes, not with a bang, but a hashtag. \nRatings note: The film contains violent images. \n'He Named Me Malala' (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (87 min.)
