These are the beers that, for me, define fall. Did I forget one? Oh of course, there's the crowd favorite pumpkin ale, too. There's a number of beers here to appease the pumpkin ale fan, and the run the gamut, from beers like Carton's Pumpkin Cream Ale, which is really a cream ale with a hint of pumpkin, to those like Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin Ale, which is really pumpkin pie in a bottle, with plenty of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, et all. While I personally lean towards the Carton's of the world, there's one that draws an especially nice balance: Southern Tier's Pumking. Southern Tier has become well-known for their large portfolio of beers. They have the standard Pale, IPA, Double IPA, Stout, etc. They also mix it up with their Well The Helles Summer?, Tangier Summer, 2XPresso, Chokolat Oranj, and Crème Brulee. Pumking pours a clear orange-copper with a thick white head that holds and sticks well. The aroma is pure fall: pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg...anything and everything in your favorite pumpkin pie. The smell alone is worth the few bucks of a bomber bottle. It couldn't hurt to drink it too, though. To no one's surprise, the taste is just like pumpkin pie as well, but all those extra flavors and spices – the cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. – aren't too desperate to be noticed, keeping what could easily be undrinkable actually quite enjoyable. There's a bit of an alcohol taste, but when you make an 8.6% ABV beer, you're entitled to that (sorry, no IBUs available, but the bitterness is very obviously low).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:51:50.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
