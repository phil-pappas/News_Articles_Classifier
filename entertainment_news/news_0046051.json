For Milwaukee viewers, the failure to reach a new agreement would have meant losing WITI-TV (Channel 6), a Fox affiliate owned by Tribune, and WGN America. \nThe earlier deal expired Sept. 30, but the two sides extended it several times as negotiations continued. \nStation groups and cable channel owners negotiate contracts for transmission fees with all pay-TV services, and usually settle with little impact on viewers. \nBut not always. \nIn 2013, a fight over retransmission fees between Time Warner Cable and Journal Broadcast Group kept WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) off the cable giant for nearly two months. Journal Broadcast — at the time, like the Journal Sentinel, part of Journal Communications — received higher fees, but lost the Channel 4 designation on Time Warner in Milwaukee. \nAnd in 2012, WISN-TV (Channel 12) was off the air for a week in a similar dispute between Time Warner and WISN's parent company Hearst Broadcasting. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
