David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the original series. \nDeaths after Medicans storm hits Cannes The annual television market Mipcom cemented its position as the television industry calendar's most important event, with organisers reporting 13,700 executives, programmers and exhibitors had passed through its doors.\nBut a breakdown of the numbers reveals some intriguing trends: 4800 buyers attended (up from 4600 last year) and 1600 of those buyers were shopping for streaming platforms (up from 1300).\nNew ITV series Beowulf . \nThat means the market, despite the gloomy predictions, is hungrier for content than ever before, and that streaming platforms and digital services are carving an ever greater slice of the traditional broadcast market.\nAdvertisement The market was also dominated by scripted content, a recent trend which shows no signs of abating.\nIn historical terms, Mipcom was a market where \"shiny floor shows\" tended to lead proceedings and the focus was on formats rather than scripted content. In the last decade, however, that has reversed.\nThe X-Factor remains a leading seller. Photo: Channel Seven \nThe leading crop of unscripted formats - The X Factor , Got Talent, Masterchef and their successful knockoffs - have not been overtaken by anything new.\nAnd scripted drama has burst forward as the most lucrative commodity in television.\nThis year there were a slew of new scripted dramas which pulled focus from everything else, including a special effects rich adaptation of Beowulf by the UK studio ITV and s redux of The X-Files which made a splashy premiere at the market.\nBrendan Moar (left) and Kris Smith (second from right) at the launch of the Insight channel at the Mipcom market in Cannes.

A number of new unscripted formats launched at the market, notably QuizUp from NBC Universal International Television.\nQuiz Up is based on a mobile app from Iceland-based Plain Vanilla Games in which players face a series of questions with multiple choice answers drawn from a database of more than half a million questions.\nInterest from the UK and US markets is generally seen as the most powerful indicator of \"buzz\" at Mipcom, as many international buyers use those markets as a yardstick to measure potential.\nThe US network NBC has commissioned 10 episodes; the UK broadcaster ITV has commissioned a pilot.\nThe four-day Mipcom market drew a raft of celebrities, including Homeland star Claire Danes and former Glee star Lea Michele who made last minute trips to Cannes, France, as guests for a dinner honouring Fox Television bosses Gary Newman and Dana Walden.\nThe celebrity guest list at the market also included comedian Tracey Ullman, actors James Purefoy, Dennis Quaid, Kate Bosworth and Cary Elwes, British screenwriter Andrew Davies, X-Files creator/producer Chris Carter and new Top Gear host Chris Evans.\nAustralian television hosts Brendan Moar and Kris Smith were also in attendance, the pair having been signed as leading presenters for a new \"4K\" ultra high definition channel, Insight, which made a splashy launch at the market.\nThe channel, which is launching in Europe, Asia and Australia, will feature 200 hours of UHD programming which Moar, Smith and a third presenter, Thom Hunt, will present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:47:14.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
