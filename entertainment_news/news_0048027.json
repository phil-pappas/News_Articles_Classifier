They haven't seen the food in question, besides a photo posted to Facebook.\nAuthorities haven't received any reports of sick animals or people.\nThe photo was posted online by Mel Dziedzic, a receptionist at Riser Animal Hospital in Skokie, where the Des Plaines dog walker brought her pet to be treated for an unrelated issue.\nThe dog didn't ingest the hot dogs, but the owner did bring the tainted food to the hospital, where staff sealed it up in a bag and disposed of it, Dziedzic said.\nShe said she was told there were more hot dogs scattered on the lawn Wednesday morning.\nKushner attended a condominium board meeting Wednesday and addressed the suspicious incident.\n\"I let them know, 'I don't know what this is about. I don't know what's going on. If somebody is doing this, they need to stop. It's incredibly dangerous and reckless,'\" Kushner said.\n News Des Plaines Pets and Animals", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:52:00.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
