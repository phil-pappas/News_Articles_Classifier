Sir Ian, who was also presenting the award, asked: ‚ÄúCan I come along?‚Äù Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes at the Pride of Britain Awards (Ian West/PA) \nSpeaking over the phone, Paula advised that Eamonn, 55, should go topless for the challenge, although he opted to wear a navy polo shirt. \nOut on the balcony of the building on London‚Äôs Embankment, the veteran 76-year-old actor was shown advising an apprehensive Eamonn not to back out: ‚ÄúThe nation would know, darling, they all heard you promise it. No, I think you‚Äôd better be a brave boy.‚Äù \nHe added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it, it‚Äôs quite bracing,‚Äù giving the broadcaster the option of having him and Ruth each throw a bucket in his face, or tip them over his head.
