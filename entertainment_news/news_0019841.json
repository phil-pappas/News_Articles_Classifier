Brock, who has an education doctorate in executive leadership, is expected to share his personal story. He grew up in William Warfield Housing Project in the city's Northern Crescent in the 1990s, a time when the crack-cocaine epidemic was at its peak.\n“Many of my friends died young,\" says Brock. \"I could be walking to the store and occasionally witness a homicide, or someone being robbed.”\nIn a case study by the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, titled “ The Enduring Challenge of Concentrated Poverty in America ,” Rochester’s Northern Crescent neighborhoods were among 16 other communities chosen from around the U.S.\nThe study reported that from 1990 to 2000, Rochester’s poverty rate grew from about 24 percent to 26 percent. At the same time, areas of high poverty increased from 17 to 19 census tracts, affecting nearly a third of Rochester’s total population. The neighborhoods immediately surrounding downtown were most affected.\nThe case study focuses on the “crescent” area north of downtown, or the Northern Crescent, which comprises four neighborhoods: Upper Falls and Marketview Heights to the east, and Edgerton and Brown Square to the west, according to the study.\n“In these communities, public safety deteriorated, access to jobs narrowed, schools failed to educate children, and wider areas were left without the fiscal or human capacity to meet these stark challenges head-on,” the report showed.\nThe Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative seeks to enable families to move out of poverty through jobs, education and skills training, housing, transportation, childcare, safe neighborhoods, judicial, and health and nutrition.\n“He’s taking the lead of the most exciting anti-poverty initiative since ABC began its campaign to promote and provide opportunities for low-income individuals and families to become self-sufficient,” said James H. Norman, president of ABC.\nThe Rochester-Monroe County Anti-Poverty Initiative is closely aligned with what ABC is doing in the community.\n\"His personal story of growing-up in poverty will engage with people who share those experiences,\" Norman added.\nBrock attended School No. 9, Jefferson Middle School, John Marshall and East High.\nTrying to escape the peril odds of a young black man from the housing project, he ended up in the corridors of Rochester Equal Opportunity Center.\n“My first year in the EOC program, I went on a college tour,” he explained. \"I ended up attending the University of Buffalo for a short period before transferring to Brockport College, where I received both of my undergraduate and graduate degrees. And, from there, I went to St. John Fisher College, for my doctorate in executive leadership, before receiving a certification in leadership coaching from the University of Rochester.\"\nBrock said the work of the anti-poverty initiative is just beginning.\nIn late September, a progress report was released after gathering ideas from more than 1,000 people.\n\"I feel good because the progress report is something we worked extremely hard on. It lays the ground work for the future work,.\" he said.\n\"This is a heavy lift. It’s a collective impact effort. We are convening it. I’m the face of it. I own that, because I can bring the lived, the professional and educational experiences that can really draw from various constituencies.\n\"But I’m just one person. Everyone has a role to play.”\nIf you go\nWhat: Action for Better Community 12th Annual Signature Luncheon.\nWhen: Noon Thursday.\nWhere: Joseph A.
