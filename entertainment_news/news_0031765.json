An Australian man was harassed and hassled by a group of Hindu outfits for having a tattoo of Indian Goddess Yellamma on shin and then showing it out in open. Apparently the foreigner was made to write a written apology, however the local Ashok Nagar police said that only a verbal complaint has been made and nothing such was done. \nThe shocking incident took place in Bengaluru on Monday morning, when the Australian couple — Matt Keith and his friend Emily — were accosted by the mob outside a restaurant on Residency Road and were harassed for insulting the Hindu sentiments by putting up a tattoo on his shin. After a certain quarrel, the local leader dressed in white called the police and then they were taken to Ashok Nagar police station. The mob of 25 people also chased the police van and according to the reports, the foreigner was made to write down an apology for hurting the religious sentiments of people.

Speaking to the media, a local leader Ramesh said, “Australian tourists had a Hindu goddess tattoo on their leg, not their fault, told them not to wear shorts. We tried explaining don’t wear ‘chaddi’ and wear Goddess tattoo but they used abusive language, so we called the police.” When asked about the apology letter, Ganesh said, “We didn’t want any FIR or apology. We just said say sorry and matter closed. We just complained to tattoo on leg.” \nAs per the latest reports, the embassies of both the nations — India and Australia — has not been involved in the matter and the district police is looking at it. \n  3:15 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:50:33.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
