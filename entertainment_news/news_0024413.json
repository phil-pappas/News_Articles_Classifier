This festival-like fun raises funds for the foundation's After School Program at Bethune Elementary School, and the foundation is about to expand into Baton Rouge schools.\nAs experienced in the ways of showmanship, the band and their foundation staff organized a memorable party underneath a tent adjacent to Walk-On's , just steps away from the Mercedes-Benz Superdome where the New Orleans Saints were playing the Dallas Cowboys: Appearances by Saints super fans Malifisaint, Da Pope, Quack The Who Dat Clown, and the 610 Stompers , who performed as did the Rolling Elvi's Jailhouse Rockers , and Rathbone with Amanda Ducorbier . The highlight, of course, was the band -- Tom Drummond, Kevin Griffin, Travis McNabb (guest appearance), and touring member James Arthur Payne with locals Big Sam and John \"Papa\" Gros â€“ who thrilled the audience (many of whom sang along) starting with \"King of New Orleans.\"\nThe final performance, though, came from the Treme Brass Band, which led a second line from the party to the Superdome.
