Fondly called Ravianna by all his industry colleagues and proteges, he has given Sandalwood some of its biggest landmark films. Dwarakish remembers the legend and his experiences with him:\n\"Frankly speaking, there would be no Dwarakish if it weren't for Ravianna. It is because of him that today there is a Dwarakish who has done 300 films in the Kannada film industry. He was like my godfather. We even produced Kulla Agent 000 together. I don't know if guru would suffice for the role he has had to play in my life. He has been a backbone to everyone in the film industry, right from Rajkumar, Vishnuvardhan and me to the younger ones. He was the giant of Kannada cinema, whose role is paramount. This is going to be a big loss for the industry. Ravianna was so friendly and approachable. He has always lent a helpful ear to everyone. It always is heartbreaking when we lose a legend from the industry.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:13:04.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
