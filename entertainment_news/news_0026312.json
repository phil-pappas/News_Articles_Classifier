Clarkson considered waving goodbye to his TV career ( Brian Lawless/PA) \nHe said: “I didn’t really know what I was going to do. A large part of me considering the appealing option of ‘nothing at all’. A smaller part thought I should change tack and do a programme about farming.” \nHe added he had no idea what former fellow Top Gear hosts James May and Richard Hammond were going to do, but once they decided to join him, together they set about finding an agent to help embark on a new venture. \nClarkson said that while the world of online programming offered up many opportunities, there were many legal issues to consider. The former Top Gear presenters will reunite for the Amazon Prime series (Brian Lawless/PA) \n“And then, riding over the horizon on a white charger, in a brown cardboard envelope, came Amazon. It took us to its London headquarters and showed us the tech it had lined up for the very near future, made us an offer in English – well, it was in American, actually, but that’s close enough – and that was that, we had a new home,” he said.
