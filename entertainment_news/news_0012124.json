They're beautiful readings of these songs. And not just readings, but personal points of view on them. All of these songs tell a story, and [the album] is paced like a really excellent, beautifully put-together show. It takes you on a journey.\"\nYou probably know the songs: \"All the Things You Are,\" \"Pick Yourself Up,\" \"The Last Time I Saw Paris,\" \"I'm Old Fashioned,\" \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" \"Look for the Silver Lining,\" among others. All standards, all familiar to anyone who's ever been to a jazz gig, or a wedding.\nWhat you may not know is the game-changing contribution that Kern (1885-1945) made to American popular song. Along with Irving Berlin, he can pretty much be credited with writing the playbook for all the great songwriters who came after: George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Harold Arlen, and on and on. Not to mention \"Moose\" Charlap, Bill's late father, whose songs were heard in the 1954 Broadway musical \"Peter Pan.\"\n\"Kern is really the angel at the top of the tree,\" Charlap says.\nWhat was American pop music like before Kern came on the scene?\nTrip back in time to the turn of the 20th century, when musical theater was coming into its own, and \"Tin Pan Alley\" – the New York song-publishing district — was cranking out sheet music on an assembly-line basis for parlor pianists. Much of this stuff was flowery, artificial, high-flown. \"Ah! Sweet mystery of life at last I've found thee!\" (Victor Herbert, 1910), for instance.\nTwo songs changed all that. \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" (1911) by Berlin, and \"They Didn't Believe Me\" (1914) by Kern, featured lyrics and musical phrasing that resemble the way people actually talk. \n\"Come on and hear, come on and hear, Alexander's Ragtime Band!\" Or \"And when I tell them – and I'm certainly going to tell them – that I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be, they'll never believe me, they'll never believe me ...\" The idea that a song could contain an aside, the way real conversation does (\"... And I'm certainly going to tell them ...\") opened up new worlds for tunesmiths.\n\"One of things that's fascinating is that it still sounds like a brand new song,\" says Bennett, who sings \"They Didn't Believe Me\" on the new album. \"It's very well written.\" \nOne foot in each world \nKern was uniquely equipped for his pioneering role. Though conservatory-trained in Europe, he had an ear for American sounds and idioms (he was born in New York and spent part of his youth in Newark). He had one foot in each world, as Charlap points out.\n\"He had the mastery of craft, yet it was still popular music, music for anyone to sing,\" Charlap says. \"It wasn't in any way highbrow.\"\nAnd Kern's innovations didn't end in 1914. Starting the next year, he began to write a series of intimate Broadway musicals, the \"Princess Theatre shows,\" with Guy Bolton and \"Jeeves and Wooster's\" P.G. Wodehouse. Shows like \"Very Good Eddie\" (1915) and \"Oh, Boy!\" (1917), written for the 299-seat Princess Theatre, set new standards for Broadway sophistication. And in 1927, Kern collaborated with Oscar Hammerstein II on the most game-changing Broadway musical of all.\n\"Show Boat\" not only contained a raft of standards (\"Make Believe,\" featured on the new album, as well as \"Ol' Man River,\" \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" and \"Bill\"), it was the first Broadway musical to integrate song and story, and the first to deal with serious issues like racism. If all American pop music descends from Kern, all American musicals descend from \"Show Boat.\"\n\"The aesthetic was very high, everybody cared about the details,\" Charlap says.\nIn the 1930s, Kern went to Hollywood, where his scores for films like \"Roberta\" (1935) and \"Swing Time\" (1936) put his music into the mouth of one of his great interpreters: Fred Astaire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:11:38.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
