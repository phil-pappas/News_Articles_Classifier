It is even more shameful that now teachers have also started taking the same route due to systematic injustice,” Gandhi said addressing scores of Shiksa Mitras (contractual teachers) from Uttar Pradesh at Jantar Mantra here today. (Also Read: Congress condemns BJP for memorandum seeking VIrbhadra Singh’s removal) Gandhi, a Lok Sabha MP from Sultanpur, was referring to the death of a shiksha mitra in Kannauj last fortnight who had allegedly committed suicide after being depressed over Allahabad High Court’s decision to quash appointment of 1.75 lakh shiksha mitras as assistant teachers. The court had last month quashed the amendments brought in the state Education department’s rules through which the shiksha mitras were being regularised. In 2010, the National Council Teachers’ Education (NCTE) ruled that only those qualify Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET) will be appointed as teacher from the primary level upwards. However, it had given an exemption of five years to those who were already teachers. With the recent High Court order the exemption has been done away with. Shiksha Mitras have been staging protests in various parts of Uttar Pradesh demanding Centre’s intervention in changing rules of appointment of permanent teachers in primary schools. The protestors came to Jantar Mantar today to stage a one-day dharna raising their demands. \n  9:16 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:19:56.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
