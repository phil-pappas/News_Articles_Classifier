According to Norris P. West, director of communications at the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Clark, a former juvenile offender who is from Los Angeles, where he is an ambassador for the Brotherhood Crusade, an anti-crime, pro-education group, had been visiting Savannah to participate in a community safety forum as part of a group that works with system-involved youth to help them draw on their strengths, learn from their mistakes and get on a more positive path. The stories this group shared “show how important it is for our juvenile justice systems to partner with the community to promote the development of our youth and provide young people with skills, opportunities and hope for the future, West said. Mr. Clark was shot twice in the arm and once in the back and according to a posting on the gofundme website, is paralyzed from the waist down, Metro police said they arrested Jaquan Bryant, 17, who was seen running over the Bay Street Viaduct after the shooting, and charged him with aggravated assault and armed robbery. Police said they are looking for two other suspects, described as young black males.\nPlease move the cannon — stop the harassment\nI am writing today to express my concern over the placement of the Civil War replica cannon used to celebrate Oak Park’s annual Moonshine Festival.\nThis year’s event took place on Oct. 17 in Oak Park, Ga. This year, as in previous years of the festival, the city and organizers of the event have specifically placed the cannon in the same location adjacent to my property line, within approximately 75 feet of a mobile home that is occupied by my sister and her family, and also within 20 feet of a permanent pet enclosure that houses a medium sized dog.\nWe also care for several additional outside pets living within close proximity.\nThe placement of the cannon in this location continues to happen despite our requests to have it relocated to an alternate and less impactful location on the multi-acre school grounds.\nDuring the day of the event, the cannon is generally fired every hour on the hour and it is also frequently fired at random, perhaps to demonstrate for visitors. As you might imagine, the blast from the cannon generates extreme anxiety for our animals in and around the area, to the point that they have to be moved inside of the home for their safety.\nAdditionally, my sister’s mobile home is a smaller model manufactured in the 1970s with walls that are very thin. Blasts from the cannon cause the windows to rattle and the mobile home to tremble. This creates an uncomfortable and chaotic environment for my family.\nThere has been a long running feud between the city of Oak Park and the county over control of the local fire department. I can only surmise that the cannon is being used as a tool of harassment by city of Oak Park officials, since my sister is on the opposite side of the argument — a volunteer first responder and fireman for Emanuel County.\nThe Moonshine Festival should be celebrated and enjoyed by visitors and citizens alike. Unfortunately, this is not the case for my family.\nTherefore, I am writing to you to raise awareness of this issue with the public and to persuade the city of Oak Park’s administration to stop this unwarranted harassment.\nCHRIS WILLIAMSON\nLyons\nFollow this list and you get my vote\nWhy is Trump leading? He is not speaking politically correct. I wish the others would do the same.\nI will vote for anyone who will give us this bucket list:\n1. Indict Hillary Clinton and other lying corrupt officials.\n2. Proclaim God Bless America and the Koran, lacking individual dignity, as a government doctrine.\n3. Mandate the government condemn all forms of selective political correctness and return to protecting human life and individual freedom in opportunity.\n4. Give us securely defined borders and citizenship.\n5. Congress: Term limits. All government elected, appointed officials and staff have perks set by average teacher, police and fire wage benefits.\n6. No federal or local government unions; set up an elected judicial board of review.\n7. Individual health benefits and Social Security paid through personal responsibility.\n8. Define welfare: Establish as an individual insurance benefit with mandated health and drug screening.\n9. Language: English only.\n10. Governing bodies can only install a flat tax. Eliminate the federal IRS. The central government can only tax its citizens for federal service of roads, military security and its elected and appointed officials. It cannot force taxation on states or private corporate businesses that provide job employment benefits.\nEDWARD L THEBO\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:05:00.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
