Getty Images for Disney Travel Deals Jacob Bryant, Variety Media, LLC Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015, 2:14 PM \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Grammy Award winning rapper T.I. couldn't vote for a female presidential candidate because he thinks they are too emotional for the position. \n\"Not to be sexist, I can't vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman,\" he said Monday on the \"The Whoolywood Shuffle\" radio show. \"Just because every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president, it's kind of like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally -- they make very permanent, cemented decisions -- and then later, it's kind of like it didn't happen or they didn't mean for it to happen.\" \nHe added, \"And I sure would hate to set off a nuke. You ain't gonna be able to negotiate the right kind of foreign policy. The world ain't ready yet.\" \nThe rapper not only thinks women couldn't be president, he thinks an imaginary monster would have a better chance at calling the shots. \n\"I think you might be able to get the Loch Ness Monster elected before you could (a woman),\" T.I. said. \"It's not right, but I'm just saying I don't think.\" \nIt didn't take long after the interview for the artist to realize his blunder and turn to Twitter to apologize. \n\"My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong,\" he tweeted. \"I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended.\" My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong. I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended. â€” T.I. (@Tip) October 13, 2015 \nT.I. still sounds a bit torn on who he could be voting for come election-time. He also said in the interview that he believes Donald Trump is the best choice to improve the economy, but can't look past his racist comments. \n\"His racist remarks, all of his off-color statements, it makes it impossible to be like completely supportive of him,\" he said. \"But just knowing what he's done for business, for himself, if he intends to do that for America, I think it would be beneficial. But I can't cast no vote for him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:09:01.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
