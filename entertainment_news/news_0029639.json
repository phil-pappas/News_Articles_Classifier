Kimberley Walsh and Justin Scott (Ian West/PA) \n“It would be lovely for him to have a baby brother or sister,” she told Hello! magazine. “I come from a big family – with two sisters and a brother – and assume that he’d like the same. \n“I used to be adamant about having four children – until I realised that it’s not just about me. I adore being a mum and can’t imagine not having more kids. \n“Motherhood changes you. It makes you softer, more emotional; and you can’t believe how obsessed you become by this little person in your life.” Kimberley with Elf co-star Ben Forster (Hello! Magazine/PA) \nKimberley also opened up about her plans to marry Justin in a romantic ceremony next year. \n“I’m very chilled about it. The venue is booked, I have the dress, so the important bits are taken care of. I’m getting very excited – but I’m no Bridezilla.” The latest issue of Hello! (Hello! Magazine/PA) \nDespite still remaining in touch with most of her former bandmates, Kimberley said she doesn’t think there will ever be another Girls Aloud reunion. \n“I think it’s unlikely. I know the fans would love it and I don’t wish to be negative, but I feel that as a band we had an amazing time and I’d like to leave it like that. \n“We’re lucky we had such a long career, and I’m fortunate to have made lifelong friendships in the process, but we’re all in different places now. Maybe in years to come we might do a one-off show.” Share article \nRead the full interview in Hello! out now.
