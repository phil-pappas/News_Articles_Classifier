Jerry Brown.\n“We applaud the governor for signing SB350,” she told us. “It provides certainty for the large-scale renewable industry.” However, she continued, “We ask the governor to turn his attention to rooftop solar.”\nWhat Ms. Chiaro is referring to is the differential treatment of renewable energy generated by utility-scale solar and rooftop solar under SB350, the so-called Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015.\nBy 2030, Southern California Edison and other state regulated utilities are required to derive half of their electricity from solar, wind or hydro.\nWhile that state mandate requires the utilities to buy electrons (or renewable energy tax credits) from utility-scale solar – like Ivanpah solar energy plant in San Bernardino County and Desert Sunlight solar farm and Genesis solar energy plant in Riverside County – it does not require the utilities to buy electrons produced by rooftop solar.\nThat confounds, considering that the small-scale solar systems installed on rooftops of some 300,000 California residences and businesses generated more than 2,500 megawatts in 2014. That’s the equivalent of a year’s worth of electricity for more than half a million homes.\nThat rooftop solar was afforded no love by SB350, Ms. Del Chiaro suggested, might be attributable to union influence in Sacramento.\nIndeed, it is no secret that organized labor has a dim view of rooftop solar. That’s because the nascent industry is made up primarily of small- and medium-sized businesses with non-unionized employees.\nBy contrast, most utility-scale solar power projects have unionized workers. Not because the developers of Ivanpah, Desert Sunlight, Genesis or other multibillion dollar solar projects are big union backers, but because it’s the price of receiving government tax credits and other considerations.\nWe believe solar energy has a promising future in California – be it utility-scale or small-scale rooftop.\nBut because the state has so distorted the market for solar and other renewable energy sources by mandates imposed by SB350 (and other such laws before it), and because the Obama administration has similarly skewed the market by throwing extremely generous tax credits at developers that build solar plants, we don’t know how promising that future really is.\nOnly when government removes its far too visible hand in the solar business will we know if the industry is built to last.\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
