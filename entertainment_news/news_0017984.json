Comes with the territory. Believe me, I know.\nOn Philippe's birthday, my kids and I made this kick-a** peanut M&M cake with a Hippie Prana Peace mini van on top and I wanted to capture the moment. The second I took out my iPhone to take a photo, they started making the weirdest faces. It actually made me laugh out loud.\nThen I put on the song \"Happy\" while I took the photo, and look what happened (see photo above).\nThat song have some serious good energy. And it's all about energy.\nWhat's your energy like right now? If it's not the BEST EVER, take a moment to shift it, because you're gonna attract more like it. Remember, like attracts like. It's physics. The Law of Attraction.\nA great way to shift your energy is your yoga practice. I'm just sayin’.\nLive an Inspired Life.\nNamaste!\nTaylor plus 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:38:36.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
