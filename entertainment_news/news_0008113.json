Image from the film Pacific Theater showing actor Jesse Richardson in the role of Blake. Filming took place in Far North Queensland in September. Source: Supplied \nSOME of Far North Queensland’s most popular natural attractions are set to be featured in an upcoming alien invasion film. \nPacific Theater centres on Blake, a man from California played by Jesse Richardson ( White Lines ), who joins the US Marine Corps following the loss of loved ones. \nIt is directed by Mike Holligan and co-produced by former Cairns local Daniel Green, who also acts in it. \n“(Blake’s) entire family is killed during an attack from a mechanised force from beyond our atmosphere,” Green said. \nThe Far North provided the backdrop for six days of filming last month. \n“We shot at Crystal Cascades, Yarrabah, False Cape, Ross and Locke, and Rocky Creek, which is halfway between Atherton and Mareeba,” Green said. \nDifferent locations will double for Taiwan and the tiny South Pacific island of New Britain. \nAccording to director Holligan, the latter setting is where the film’s “final battle” happens. \nTwelve people, including seven cast members, were involved with the production during the film’s time in the Far North. \nFilming also took place in the Daintree. \nHolligan said the experience of filming in the region was great. \n“We filmed in some amazing spots,” he said. \nThe filmmaker said a highlight was shooting on a beach near Yarrabah. \nGreen also revealed that his Cairns past had a major impact on the decision to film in the region. \n“Mike and I were discussing potential locations that could double as South Pacific jungle,” he said. \nGreen pointed out that if filming took place in Cairns, the location scouting could be done in just a weekend. \nThat happened back in May. \nA release date for Pacific Theater is still be to determined, according to Green. There is an aim to take it to the annual South by Southwest event in Austin, Texas. \n“We’re also planning to take it to the market attached to Sundance,” he said. \nTo find out more about the film, visit facebook.com/pacifictheaterfilm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:51:53.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
