The owner of Love Ranch, Dennis Hof, claims the basketball star racked up a $75,000 bill before he was rushed to hospital after a four-day drink and drug-fuelled binge and is asking for payment from the sportsman or his wife Khloe Kardashian. He told the New York Daily News: \"I'm getting a lot of questions [from Lamar's accountants]. They're requesting the credit card slips and asking, 'Did he sign them?' I sent them his driver's license, the slips, some other stuff.\"I have no problem filing against her or him. Khloe, she's the wife. They're responsible for their debts. Why are they calling me? They need to do the right thing and pay.\" And Dennis claims Lamar has offered to pay the sum, telling the owner to split it between two of the ranch's employees, Monica Monroe and Ryder Cherry. Meanwhile, it was previously revealed that Lamar has had to undergo emergency surgeries as he recovers in a Los Angeles hospital. He is said to be \"emotional\" after having two procedures because of \"chest issues\" and the 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' star is the only person able to see him. keeping up with the kardashians", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:27:55.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
