I keep wondering why I’m putting myself through this. There’s going to be at least three ex-girlfriends there as far as I can tell. \n“I couldn’t decide whether to play Winchester and it’s turned into part stand-up, part reunion. I’ve had so many messages saying I haven’t seen you for 25 years, although in most cases there’s a reason for that!\" \nChristian will be revealing the ups and downs of life on air – from winning multiple awards for his show to receiving death threats and abusive letters from offended clowns and angry cat lovers. \nHe adds: “I had a three page letter from a crazy cat woman complaining about my attitude to cats and the Cliff Richard and Barry Manilow fans are the worst. One of them sent me a death threat! Complaining has got completely out of control, it’s really disproportionate! \n“People are so much more sensitive than they used to be. They call for me to get sacked. I’m on the radio, I’m just not that offensive. You can’t be! People get so wound up about comedians, but we’re not politicians we’re just professional clowns! \n“The audiences seemed to love the show in Edinburgh. They were just shocked at the things people will complain about.” \nWinchester Comedy Festival got under way yesterday with John Lloyd’s new show Emperor of the Prawns – a hilarious hour from one of British comedy’s most inventive minds with a CV that includes creating Not The Nine O’Clock News, Blackadder, Spitting Image and QI. It brings 28 acts to five venues in Winchester across four days.
