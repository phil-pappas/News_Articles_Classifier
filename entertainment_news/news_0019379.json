Drake kinda dances a bit like a drunk uncle at a wedding! 2015-10-21 11:52 \nCape Town - So Drake finally released the music video to his hit song, Hotline Bling . \nWhat shocked us most about Drake's new video was his complete lack of skills on the dance floor. \nIn the video Drake finds himself dancing alone in room. And it's those very dance moves that's got everyone talking. \n(Screengrab: AppleMusic) \nThe rapper is seen doing some interesting moves such as the chacha, shimmy, salsa and even some Bollywood tricks. \nBut what's even funnier is the memes. #DrakeAlwaysOnBeat proves that those 'drunk uncle moves' (what we like to call it) are always on beat: This is the best one ????I swear???? #DrakeAlwaysOnBeat #DrakeIsAlwaysOnBeat pic.twitter.com/n6ULK3MqmF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:07:42.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
