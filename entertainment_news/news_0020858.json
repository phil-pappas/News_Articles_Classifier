One of his best-known works is Celestial Harmonies (2000), a novel about his family's history during the Austro-Hungarian era when their estate was home to people like Austrian composer Joseph Haydn.\nA sequel to that book is Revised Edition (2002), which documents how author confronted the discovery that his father had been a communist-era informant.\nHe is also the author of The Transporters (1983), A Little Hungarian Pornography (1984), and The Book of Hrabal (1990).\n(Reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Richard Balmforth )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:36:28.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
