The last thing he would want to do would be to add more stress to her plate.'' \nMeanwhile, the sportsman is recovering well following his collapse, which was spurred on following a drink and drugs binge, in Las Vegas and is now breathing on his own. \nKhloe, who filed for divorce from Lamar last December following four years of marriage, is currently making all of his medical decisions and has decided to move him to Los Angeles, where she resides, so she can support him. \nA source said: ''Khloe and her mother Kris [Jenner] decided to move Lamar to a rehab centre in LA so they can all be closer to him. He's still getting better little by little.'' Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:07:09.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
