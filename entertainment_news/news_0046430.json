He was 78.\nBorn in 1936 in New Orleans' Treme neighborhood, Johnson picked up the sticks early in life, becoming a professional drummer by age 17. He was nicknamed \"Smokey\" after a fellow musician joked that he saw smoke coming from Johnson's bass drum.\n\"And I got stuck with Smokey,\" Johnson said with a laugh in a 2011 interview.\nOver the years, he provided the beats for a litany of New Orleans musical legends, most notably for Domino as well as a 28-year stint with Dave Bartholomew's big band. He also played on any number of memorable recordings, from Earl King's \"Trick Bag\" to Professor Longhair's \"Big Chief.\" In 1964, Johnson wrote and recorded the infectious \"It Ain't My Fault\" with Wardell Quezergue, a song that endures as a Carnival staple.\nIn the early 1960s, Johnson and a number of other New Orleans musicians packed their bags for Detroit, where they booked session work at Motown Records. By the time a homesick Johnson returned to New Orleans, as the story goes, his powerful playing style had influenced any number of Detroit musicians.\nIn an interview last year , WWOZ-FM host George Ingmire, who also hosts the nationally syndicated radio show \"New Orleans Calling,\" said Johnson belonged \"on the Mount Rushmore of New Orleans drummers,\" along with Idris Muhammad, Johnny Vidacovich and Herlin Riley.\nJohnson retired from performing in the 1990s following a stroke. In the wake of 2005's Hurricane Katrina, he moved into the Musicians' Village in the Upper 9 th Ward, where he could often be seen holding court in his front yard, sometimes with some of his old musical partners. Fittingly, his bright green house was situated on a street named after his former band leader: Bartholomew Street.\nJohnson will be remembered with a musical tribute Friday (Oct. 16) from 6 to 9 at Charbonnet Family Services funeral home, 1615 St. Philip St. Funeral services will be held Saturday (Oct. 17) at The Asia Baptist Church, 1400 Sere St. Visitation will begin at 8 a.m. with a funeral service starting at 9, followed by a traditional jazz funeral.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlBuc863hU0"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:15:50.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
