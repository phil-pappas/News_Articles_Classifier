Original animation and effects were created by Dream Machine Creative.\nThe iconic episode “A Man for Marilyn” has been reconstructed around original composed songs using dialogue from the show to create a first-of-its kind for TV, following in the macabre and humorous traditions of Rocky Horror in film and Sweeney Todd on stage. The song “What’s Wrong With Me?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXYjFzozUYs is a highlight of the episode which airs at 8pm and 11pm ET during The Munsters Marathon Halloween party which runs from noon to midnight. The special was conceived by COZI TV Creative Director Alan Goodman, who along with well-known composers Paul Rolnick and Jamie Lawrence, crafted the original songs. Original animation and effects were created by Dream Machine Creative.\n“We are all about having fun at COZI TV and this Halloween, we’re excited to be using the hottest trend in social media and pop culture to bring your favorite monsters to life in a new way. No one’s ever done this before on TV, so we can’t wait for fans to see it and sing along,” said Meredith McGinn, Senior Vice President of COZI TV and LX.TV Productions. “COZI TV’s The Munsters Marathon is the perfect way to celebrate Halloween and of course, it’s The Munsters’ favorite holiday!”\nThe Munsters aired from 1964 to 1966, centering around the daily life of the Munsters, who considered themselves a typical working-class family despite the fact they were different. The family, which included Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster, the father; Yvonne De Carlo as Lily Munster, his wife; Al Lewis as Grandpa; Butch Patrick as Eddie Munster, the son; and Beverley Owen and later Pat Priest as niece Marilyn Munster, lived in a crumbling old Victorian mansion strewn with cobwebs and filled with dust in the fictional town of Mockingbird Heights, a Los Angeles suburb. Their reappearance in 2015 includes iconic and original television as well as their foray into social media and the world today.\nSince its launch nearly three years ago, COZI TV has become the standard for iconic programming with a very contemporary twist. Engaging a wide range of viewers with its use of trending tech and timeless shows that boast a core fan base and those who are watching for the first time today, COZI TV continues its leading position with a never-before-seen television first for all ages.\nFor more on COZI TV, visit http://www.cozitv.com and follow COZI TV on twitter @COZITV and Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/cozitv.\n#Munsters #AutoTuneTheMunsters\n# # #\nAbout COZI TV\nCOZI TV is NBC’s national multicast network designed to deliver an easy-to-watch, comfortable and familiar viewing experience to audiences across the country.
