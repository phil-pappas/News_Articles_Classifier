Photo: Vittorio Zunino Celotto \nBuy now on Booktopia The best stories about death are the ones that are full of life. When Lucio finds out he has 100 days to live, he vows to live, in the true sense of the word, and love, and make amends and cram as much happiness as he can into his remaining days.\nOne Hundred Days of Happiness is a joyous book that left me crying like a baby for a good 15 minutes at the end, a gibbering mess, which worried  Italian author Fausto Brizzi .\nOne Hundred Days of Happiness , by Fausto Brizzi. Photo: Supplied \n\"That's a long time to be crying,\" he says. \"But it's exactly what I hoped would happen when people read the book, so thank you for crying.\"\nAdvertisement We've exchanged questions by email, via a translator, as the 46-year-old author, screenwriter and film director speaks little English. Not the sort of interview you'd normally chase, but stories that result in such an emotional response need to be shared.\nAnd for Brizzi, it's all about the emotion. He says he wanted to tell this story in book form because movies don't want a sad ending.\n\"I wanted to write a genre that cinema doesn't want from me – a 'melò' – meaning a romantic comedy with a tragic ending.\n\"So this was my challenge, to try and write a novel about an important issue such as death, death through an illness, but [how you would do that] keeping a smile on your face.\"\nLucio starts the 100 days in a particularly bad place, too. He's been caught cheating on his wife and he's sleeping on the floor of his father-in-law's bakery, but by the time he dies, there's a smile is on his face. He's confirmed his love for his wife, helped his father-in-law find love of his own, made new friends and spent time amongst old ones.\nFriendship is very important to Brizzi. It's rare to find a story where male friendship is at the core, particularly friendships that are so open and full of emotion.\n\"I have a lot of friends who are in some ways like family, and it was a conversation with one of these friends, on a fairly dull evening, that the idea for One Hundred Days  came to life.\"\nBrizzi says he would be friends with Lucio, who is lovable but exasperating in the same breath.\n\"I would definitely be friends with Lucio, his personality is actually quite similar to mine. His passions are the same as mine. The Three Musketeers [Lucio's close group of male friends in the book] are inspired by three real friends of mine. Male friendship is a weird thing made up of solid trust and sometimes unbelievable betrayal, but it is in some ways a pillar of my life.\"\nThere's a discussion to be had too about the finality of it all, how he is able to be specific about the day he dies, but that would spoil the ending. Suffice to say there is much discussion too about \"the afterwards\" – about what happens when you die.\n\"I don't believe there is an afterwards,\" Brizzi says. \"I would be shocked if it did exist, but pleasantly surprised. I try to live my life here as well as possible, to leave good memories behind, to leave happy tracks behind. My books are now part of these tracks.\"\nBrizzi says one thing writing the book made him think about was living in the moment and not waiting for things to happen.\n\"It's like when we were at school and we used to wait until the last minute to do our homework. Humans tend to procrastinate. Sometimes on the happy things but also the necessary things. And we live in a limbo where we're not doing things that are useful or pleasant, but simply waiting for things to happen. But nothing really happens if you don't set out to find them.\"\nOne Hundred Days of Happiness , by Fausto Brizzi. Picador, $29.99.
