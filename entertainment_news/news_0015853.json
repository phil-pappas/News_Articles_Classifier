(Interscope Records via AP) \nSelena Gomez, \"Revival\" (Interscope Records) \nSophomore albums are notoriously tricky propositions, but Selena Gomez's second solo venture, \"Revival,\" breezes through to the finish line — the dance floor —with 11 nearly impeccable tracks that skip from the 1960s to the '80s to right this minute. \nOn \"Revival,\" Gomez continues her foray into a heady mix of electronic dance music pop accessorized with rapping from A$AP Rocky, writing from Charli XCX, soulful pianos, steel drums, and her own chameleon voice, showcasing her pipes in the piano-accompanied \"Hands to Myself\" and with warm, rich vocals in the serious yet jubilant \"Revival.\" \nThe first single from the album, \"Good for You,\" her biggest hit to date, is a subtle electro tune. But the song's flow suffers with A$AP Rocky's bewildering (if trendy) interlude — a minor hiccup on an otherwise seamless album. \"Same Old Love\" starts off with a whimsical '60s feel, but morphs into a punchy bass dance track. \n\"Body Heat\" is on odd saxophone infused Latino drum dance floor scorcher, but it's \"Survivors\" that true trance-house addicts will fall for. \"Kill Them With Kindness\" is an approachable dance track with added bells and whistles (literally), while \"Sober\" brings '80s synthesizers to the fore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:01:24.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
