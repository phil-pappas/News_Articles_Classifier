She remained in hospital for almost three weeks, and her parents were granted control of her finances. \nAmanda left the public eye and quit her social media accounts, but returned earlier this year appearing happy and healthy. \nShe previously said on Twitter.com that she had considered transferring to other universities last year, but the former child actress is now giving FIDM another go. \nShe began taking sketch classes for a fashion design course last week, according to TMZ.com, and reportedly has a security guard with her on campus. \nAmanda was not prosecuted for the DUI arrest.
