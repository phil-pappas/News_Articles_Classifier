NYPD Officer Randolph Holder went to work each day with an eye toward a brighter future: A detective’s gold shield, a house in the ’burbs and a life of wedded bliss.\nThe decorated five-year cop was simply walking the path first trod by his grandfather — and then his father — during his days as a boy in Guyana.\n“He was following in his father’s footsteps, wanting to make his father proud,” said his cousin Claude Sultan, 22, of Far Rockaway, Queens. “He was one of the greatest men that I’ve come to know in my life.”\nTEARS OF RAGE: OFFICER RANDOLPH HOLDER'S LIFE MATTERED\nHolder, 33, died Tuesday when a gun-toting gangbanger shot him to death on a pedestrian ramp over the FDR Drive. Suspect Tyrone Howard, 30, was charged with murder.\nThe pointless shooting came just as the immigrant cop’s hopes of moving from Mill Basin, Brooklyn, were within his grasp.\nGardiner Anderson/for New York Daily News Officer Randolph Holder pictured with his girlfriend Mary Muhammad. “He should have been closing on a house next month in Valley Stream, but all of the dreams went down the drain,” his father, Randolph Holder Sr., said Wednesday morning.\nAsked what should happen to the accused killer, the father didn’t mince words.\n“Well, to me, he should be put to death,” he said.\nRandolph Sr. wasn’t surprised when his son put on a cop’s uniform after coming to the city.\n“He always wanted to be a policeman,” said the elder Holder. “That he did. He delivered his duties diligently, with pride.”\n“He was a very punctual, very easygoing young man,” the slain cop’s dad said wistfully.\nDebbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News “He should have been closing on a house next month in Valley Stream, but all of the dreams went down the drain,” his father, Randolph Holder Sr., said. The father taught the son to work hard, to become a loving father and a solid citizen.\nMary Muhammad, Holder’s live-in girlfriend, lamented the loss of the bright future she had hoped to share with the ambitious officer.\n'HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE STREETS': TYRONE HOWARD CHARGED WITH MURDER IN THE SHOOTING DEATH OF NYPD OFFICER RANDOLPH HOLDER\n“We had our plans,” said the 32-year-old makeup artist. “We were closing on a house. We were going to get married. We were building a life together.”\nMuhammad, whose 12-year-old daughter lived with the couple, said being a cop was everything to Holder.\n“Let’s remember Randy for the great man and loving man he was,” she said. “He was a great cop and he gave his life in the line of duty. He was very brave. He was a good man and a good cop.”\nDebbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News “He loved what he did,” said his heartbroken ex-girlfriend, 33-year-old Malika Clarke-Yard. Officer Holder was also the proud father of a 16-year-old daughter.\nCousin Ruth Lawrence told the Daily News that Holder was poised to move up in the department ranks.\n“He said he was going to be a detective,” said Lawrence, 54. “He was just waiting for the call.”\nThere was another side to the straight-arrow lawman. Whenever the family gathered for a party, Holder handled the DJ duties with a mix of reggae and soca music from their homeland.\n“He did everything for his family,” said relative Natalie Andrews, 32. “He was a good kid, very respectful.”\nHolder immigrated to New York about 12 years ago, working a security job for Toys “R” Us before taking the NYPD exam. Cousin Damani Adams said Holder felt like he was destined to work in the family business.\n“He wanted to be out in the community, around people,” said Adams, 18. “At the end of the day, he was still out there helping people, saving lives, doing what any good cop would have done.”\nAfter a Tuesday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. wake at the Far Rockaway Community Church of the Nazarene and a 3 p.m. Wednesday funeral at the same place, Holder’s body will be returned to Guyana for burial.\nRichard Harbus/for New York Daily News A homemade memorial of flowers and burning candles appeared outside the East Harlem headquarters of the unit. The entire family celebrated when Holder, in the family tradition, graduated from the Police Academy in July 2010.\n“When he came home, everybody was so proud of him and excited,” said Adams, of Far Rockaway. “He was a great person. He kept to himself, did what he had to do, and then he’d come home.”\nNYPD COMMISSIONER BRATTON MOURNS DEATH OF OFFICER RANDOLPH HOLDER: 'FOUR COPS LOST IN LESS THAN A YEAR IS TOO MANY'\nAndrews had reservations about the career in law enforcement, but Holder jumped into the job with both feet.\n“You hear so much about cops — but he liked it,” she said. “He went for it. Even when my husband questioned him and said ‘Do you like this?’ He said ‘Yes.’ He said he was not afraid to handle it.”\nThe new cop showed a natural affinity for the job, making 125 arrests in five years. Holder was honored with five NYPD citations for excellent police duty and one for meritorious police duty.\n“He loved what he did,” said his heartbroken ex-girlfriend, 33-year-old Malika Clarke-Yard — a high school classmate in Georgetown, Guyana.\nShe begged city leaders to do more to get guns off the street.\nTodd Maisel/New York Daily News Bill de Blasio and Commissioner Bill Bratton mourn with the step-mother of Officer Randolph Holder. “Mr. Mayor, do something!” she hollered. “Mr. (Police) Commissioner, do something! Too many fatherless children.”\nAt the time of his death, Holder was working in plainclothes, patrolling housing projects uptown in Police Service Area 5.\nA homemade memorial of flowers and burning candles appeared outside the East Harlem headquarters of the unit. “#BlueLivesMatter,” read a sign taped to one bouquet.\nKioka Jackson, 41, met Holder while serving as secretary for the 25th Precinct Community Council — and remembered him as a cop with a conscience.\n“He did care about the young people in the community,” the teary-eyed East Harlem resident said. “He talked to them about the understanding of being an African-American.”\nHis cousin Sultan said the slain cop’s families — in Guyana, in New York, and in the NYPD — were devastated by the brutal killing that took away Holder’s dreams.\n“I just dropped on the floor and started crying,” he said. “We all lost a part of us.”\nWith Kerry Burke , Chauncey Alcorn\nRelated Stories NYPD officer dies after he's shot in East Harlem Editorial: Holder a taken-for-granted hero cop slain Holder’s suspected killer linked to other shooting: sources", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:29:42.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
