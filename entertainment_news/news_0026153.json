Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence started the recent conversation about the Hollywood wage gap when she wrote an essay attacking it in the Lenny newsletter produced by \"Girls\" writer and director Lena Dunham. The issue has been gaining traction ever since. Comedian Amy Schumer, the star and creator of her own irreverent sketch show \"Inside Amy Schumer\", said the issue of equal pay went beyond the movie industry, joking about \"the poor victims of Hollywood\". \"If we raise minimum wage, most minimum wage workers are women ... that'll help,\" she said. Lawrence, who according to Forbes was the world's highest-paid film actress last year, said she found out through leaked Sony Pictures emails that she had been paid millions less than any of her three male co-stars in the 2013 movie \"American Hustle.\" She wrote that she felt she had \"failed as a negotiator.\" Swedish actress Alicia Vikander said any conversation about the issue of equal pay should be welcomed. \"It's all about bringing awareness and to educate people,\" she said. Meanwhile, American actress Zoe Saldana said: \"Nothing is more overwhelming than actually when men come out to celebrate, that actually warms my heart.\" Press CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code http://reut.rs/1MBPl3H", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:23:54.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
