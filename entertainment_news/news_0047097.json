(Credit: BANG Showbiz) \nTransgender Olympian Caitlyn Jenner will not be charged with manslaughter in connection with a deadly car crash in Los Angeles earlier this year, authorities said Wednesday. \n\"There will be no charges\" filed, Jane Robison, a spokeswoman at the Los Angeles District Attorney's office told AFP. \nJenner in February was at the wheel of a large SUV that rear-ended a woman's car which swerved into oncoming traffic and was struck by a vehicle. \nJenner walked away unhurt but the woman died. \nInvestigators had found that Jenner was driving \"unsafely for the prevailing road conditions\" and said she faced up to a year in prison if convicted of manslaughter. \nThe crash took place just months before Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, came out as transgender.
