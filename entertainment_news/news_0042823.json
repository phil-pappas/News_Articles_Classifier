Choijin Lama Temple Museum has over 80 masks and costumes for the ancient religious Tsam mask dance in its collection. Some 50 items were displayed in the exhibition. “Tsam”, a photo book including 45 unique pictures of Tsam, was released at the event. Mongolians consider Tsam dance to be a ceremony to exorcise evil, which is why costumes for Tsam must be magnificently ornamented using rare and unique materials. These features can be seen in the piece titled “Khar Ikh Itgelt”, made with a modig (cape), dodig (apron), deel (Mongolian traditional garment), ruujin (decorative cape over the whole costume) made with about eight pearl strings made from human or animal bones, and a skull. The exhibition will continue until October 25. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16503   11  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:39:37.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
