More than 221,000 sandbags, 212,000 bottles of water, 145 ready-to-eat meals and 200 generators are being kept downstate ahead of the storm's arrival, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office. The National Weather Service says the hurricane, which has been upgraded to a category four, could hit New York by Tuesday morning.\nCuomo and state officials held a conference call earlier today to discuss the state's preparation. You can listen to the replay here:\n>\nSome highlights:\nThomas Prendergast, chairman of the MTA, said the New York City transit system is in a better position to deal with Joaquin that it was prior to Superstorm Sandy in 2012. \"We are in much better shape. The facilities that were severely damaged have been restored to the condition they were before the storm and in some, better,\" he said. Cuomo said it's impossible to prepare for every possible outcome. \" Sandy was a historic storm, and we did learn from that and we did prepare for that,\" he said. \"But again, I've learned the hard way never to say that we are prepared for whatever comes our way, because you cannot be prepared for whatever comes your way.\" Prendergast said it is \"way to early\" to know whether the storm will cause any shutdowns of the New York City transit system.
