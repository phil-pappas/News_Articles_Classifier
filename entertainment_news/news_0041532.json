You can see it at The Hollywood Cinerama Dome, The TCL Chinese Theater and it is even showing at Universal Studios. But by far the best place to see the movies is at AMC Puente Hills 20 in Industry.\nThe mostly-regular theater is anything but normal on Back to the Future Day because it’s part of Puente Hills Mall, which played Twin Pines Mall in the movies.\nSome of the trilogy’s most iconic scenes were shot in the parking lot outside of the mall. It’s where Doc Brown tests his DeLorean time machine, where Marty time travels and where Doc is shot by Libyan terrorists. And you can see the movies right there. Unbelievable luck, right?\n“We are the Twin Pines Mall so we wanted to make sure guests who want to experience the nostalgia would have the chance to see the movies at the real Twin Pines,” said theater manager Daniel Medina.\nIn fact, Medina and his staff are so dedicated to letting all Back to the Future fans see the movies they’re showing the trilogy twice. First on Oct. 17 starting at 5 p.m. and again on Oct. 21 starting at 4:29 p.m., the exact time Marty travels to in the movie.\nThat’s not all though. On Sunday Oct. 18, Puente Hills Mall and We’re Going Back , a “Back to the Future” themed non-profit, are hosting “Back to the Future Fan Appreciation Day & Time Machine Day.” The event will have surprise cosplay flashmobs, food and drink and displays with real props from all three “Back to the Future” movies.\nThe DeLorean Time machine and Doc Brown’s van, along with other memorabilia are on display now at the mall and will stay through Oct. 25.\nWe’re Going Back is also hosting a free screening of the first “Back to the Future” in the parking lot of the Mall on Oct. 25.\nSo unless you’re worried about disrupting the space/time continuum, get your tickets to see all three “Back to the Future” movies at Twin Pines.\nAdvertisement About the Author Reach the author at samantha.bush@langnews.com or follow Samantha on Twitter: samanthaMVB .\nFull bio and more articles by Samantha Valtierra Bush Back to top", "external_links": ["https://www.amctheatres.com/movie-theatres/los-angeles/amc-puente-hills-20", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=510", "http://www.puentehills-mall.com/event/back-to-the-future-30th-anniversary/2145460868", "http://www.weregoingback.com/", "http://twitter.com/samanthaMVB"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:02:00.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
