The records also show that Heintz and Superintendent Nanciann Gatta expensed meals that occasionally exceeded limits recommended by the district.\nA review of hundreds of pages of credit card statements, mileage reimbursement and other expense reports obtained from the district through an open records request offers a glimpse into spending approved by the school board for Heintz and Gatta, both of whom were put on paid leave in August. At the time, a district spokesman released a statement that the administrators had \"agreed\" to take a leave until further notice \"due to differences\" with the board. The school board hired a forensic technology company, an accountant and a law firm to conduct an unspecified probe that is ongoing.\nThe Tribune previously reported that Heintz and Gatta benefited from lucrative perks that were not included in their contracts, raising questions about financial oversight in the district in recent years. The most expensive was $296,000 worth of tuition payments made on their behalf to the University of Chicago, where the two earned MBAs.\nThe expenses were approved at the same time the north suburban district was grappling with cuts to staff and student programs.\nDistrict and school board officials have refused to answer questions about the probe or the expense reports. \"Because of confidential issues involved, we are not able to comment at this time,\" district spokesman Jim Szczepaniak wrote in an email.\nAmid that ongoing silence, staff were given a directive on Sept. 25 to refer all media inquiries to the spokesman. Gatta filed a civil rights lawsuit last week alleging that in curtailing comments, district officials have violated the free speech rights of her and other employees. Her husband, Fernando Perez, who also works for the district, is named as a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, which is seeking untold \"punitive damages (except against the board), prejudgment interest and reasonable attorneys' fees\" for the couple and other district employees.\nIt's the second lawsuit Gatta has filed against the district over the past month. She also is seeking whistleblower protection and an injunction against the school board, which she alleges is attempting to force her to resign to \"avoid the political implications of honoring the full value of her contract.\" Heintz and Gatta are under contract through 2018, and taxpayers could be on the hook for more than $1.7 million worth of salaries and benefits to buy them out.\nIt's unclear whether any of the spending under Gatta's leadership is connected to the ongoing investigation.\nDistrict policy does not offer guidelines for airfare and hotel spending. Records show, however, that Heintz filed expense reports that appeared to double-bill for travel expenses.\nRecords show that Heintz may have expensed the district twice for traveling to a one-day conference at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law in December. According to receipts he submitted to the district, he took a $22 cab ride at 7:30 a.m. from Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood to the law school. At 5:30 p.m., another receipt shows, he took a taxi back to the district. On a mileage reimbursement form, Heintz logged 19.59 miles for driving \"5.87 mls. home to Kent/ 13.72 mls. Kent to District\" that same day. He was paid $10.97 for mileage.\nProfessional development organizations encourage school administrators to attend conferences to learn best practices. However, there is no standard recommendation for how many they should attend each year. Many suburban school districts pay for administrators and school board members to attend education conferences.\nHeintz's contract says he is \"encouraged to attend appropriate professional meetings and continuing education at the local, state, national and international levels. Within budget constraints, as approved by the superintendent, the costs of attendance shall be paid by the board.\"\nHeintz took 10 trips during the past two years, and the district spent $13,000 on his airfare, conference registration fees and hotels â€” some costing more than $500 a night. In addition to the airfare and hotel stays, the district spent thousands more on taxi rides, car rentals and meals for Heintz related to the conferences.\nRecords show Gatta signed off on most of the expenses, which were then approved by the school board. Taxpayers picked up the tab.\n\"Dr. Gatta has done nothing wrong,\" her attorney Thomas Durkin wrote in an emailed response to questions. \"Your 'questions' are unfounded and without merit,\" he added.\n\"Agreed,\" Heintz's attorney Marc Siegel wrote in an email echoing Durkin's response.\nBoth attorneys said their clients have been unfairly targeted by a new school board and the teachers union, prompting their suspensions. They did not address specifically the expense reports and reimbursements found by the Tribune in district records.\nGatta has been superintendent at the Niles Township district since 2008. Heintz, an attorney, has served as an assistant superintendent since 2009 and also does legal work for the district. Both are former teachers in District 219, which draws students from Niles, Skokie, Lincolnwood and Morton Grove.\nExpense reports show Heintz has crisscrossed the country since June 2013, attending conferences in San Antonio, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Denver, Nashville, Palm Springs, Calif., Philadelphia, plus three trips to New Orleans. School board members attended some of the same conferences.\nOn a trip to Nashville in March of this year, Heintz stayed at the five-star, $500 per night Hermitage Hotel. During an April 2014 trip to New Orleans for a National School Boards Association conference, Heintz was reimbursed for a four-night, $2,196 stay at the Loews Hotel. Later that year, Heintz attended another National School Boards Association conference in Denver. The district put him up at a Sheraton hotel for three nights. The hotel bill was $1,588, records show.\nDistrict policy sets meal expense caps for local travel not requiring an overnight stay. The limits are $12 for breakfast, $18 for lunch and $35 for dinner.\nRecords show Heintz and Gatta dined together locally on 20 occasions during the last two school years, five of which exceeded reimbursement limits. One of their most frequent dining spots was Makisu Sushi in Skokie where taxpayers in October 2013 picked up an $85 \"working lunch,\" records show. When lunches on Heintz's expense report were flagged as exceeding the allowable limit, records show that Gatta approved them.\nExpense reports reviewed by the Tribune included a detailed accounting of who attended the dozens of meals paid for by the district during the past two years. Most were for school board meetings or staff events. One of the priciest was a holiday party at Libertad in December, which cost $1,050. A receipt shows that food expenses were $625, and Heintz left a $425 tip, which was paid for by the district.\nIn the face of recent spending cuts, the school board voted last week to redraft the budget in hopes of freeing up money for textbooks, supplies and other student programs. Once the budget is reworked, it will be on display for public comment before the board puts the spending plan to a vote.\nacaputo@tribpub.com\n Niles Libertad", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200579/turbine/ct-niles-administrator-expenses-met-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:05:01.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
