(Video via CNN ) \nThis will be the second time the business mogul lent his talents to the show. He last hosted in 2004. \nTrump returning to the iconic Studio 8H also means NBC is reneging on its threat of severing ties with Trump â€” an issue that arose after Trump made those comments about immigrants. \nBut regardless, we are definitely looking forward to the Donald interacting with Taran Killam, who plays Trump on \"SNL.\" And we've already seen Trump in sketch formats on \" The Tonight Show ,\" which have given us some good laughs. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:49:26.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
