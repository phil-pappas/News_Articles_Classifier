The crew spent three years training wolves for the movie. \nChina Film News said it has been replaced by \"Go Away Mr. Tumor,\" a romantic comedy about an optimistic woman coping with cancer. \nThe last Chinese submission to be nominated for best foreign language film was Zhang Yimou's 2002 film \"Hero.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:43:19.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
