And boy...was there one big surprise last night! \nReverting back to that horrible elimination method Amanda and Loyiso were left sitting in the torture chairs until the end of round one performances. \nAmanda’s luck had finally run out as her Idols journey came to an end. \nOn to the performances. \nKarabo started off the show with the BoyzIIMen classic, Water Runs Dry . He has such a smooth tone to his voice, his high notes were a bit sharp but he did an okay job. For his today song he took on Hozier’s, Someone New . There is no doubt he can sing but there’s just a spark missing. Sometimes he just doesn’t look like he is enjoying himself and for me as the viewer/listener it's a turn off. Rating: 3/5 \nDineo’s entry into the top 6 came as a big surprise especially after the harsh criticism she received from the judges last week. I’m not sure if it was because she felt under the weather of if the pressure of the competition is getting to her. Both her performances were shaky and a bit off key. Something just wasn’t right. With that said there were some really good parts in her Lauryn Hill rendition Rating: 2/5 \nIs it even possible that Rhema could be more talented?! Well he certainly showed us all. His performances this week were accompanied by a piano and a guitar. He is a consummate performer who just keeps getting better. I wasn’t feeling the first song, but he made up for it in round 2. Rating: 4/5 \nA comeback, a second wind whatever it is Siphelele had a very good night. His song choices were on point, his singing was damn good. I don’t know who this new person is but welcome to the competition! He proved all the naysayers (me included) wrong this week. Rating: 4/5 \nI have been very hard on Mmatema’s performances and last night she surprised me with her round 1 song. It was beautifully executed. Her entire approach to the song was different for the first time she didn’t over sing. Her second song choice didn’t impress much. Rating: 3/5 \nIt was Loyiso’s first time in the bottom two and he was visibly emotional after the elimination. He took all that emotion and poured it into his first performance. One word; beautiful. It was a flawless performance. I know I have harped on and on about it but his songs choices are so eclectic. He showed if off again with his second choice, James Bay’s, Hold Back the River . What makes him such a good singer is that he listens to different genres of music and really isn’t afraid to try different things. Loy Loy is back! Rating: 4/5 \nWatch all the performances here .
