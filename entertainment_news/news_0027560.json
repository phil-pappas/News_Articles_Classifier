Christopher Eccleston (Jack Plunkett/Invision) \nTalking about the project, Eccleston said: “I’m very proud to be reunited with writer Peter Bowker on The A Word. This is a special job for us all. We hope the audience take us to their hearts.” \nRounding out the cast of The A Word is Our Zoo’s Lee Ingleby, Grantchester’s Morven Christie and Fresh Meat’s Greg McHugh. \nFans of Sherlock can look forward to Vinette Robinson’s performance and there is a newcomer in the form of six-year-old actor Max Vento. \nThe original series, Pilpelim Tsehubim, was broadcast in Israel in 2010. It was written and created by Keren Margalit, who will be an executive producer on the UK version. \nIn addition to writing duties, Bafta winner Bowker, who won for BBC Two drama Marvellous, will also executive produce. Twice Academy-nominated Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty, Rev) will direct. \nPeter Bowker said: “We have the opportunity here to make something funny, tough, realistic and inventive about contemporary family life and autism. In a society where imperfection increasingly comes with blame attached, it seems timely to look at how autism is regarded both within a family and the wider community – and to give some insight into how that experience might be for the child on the autism spectrum.” \nHe added: “It’s a drama full of ideas – about parenthood, about disability, about communication, about community – and will emphatically engage an audience whatever their experience of the subject.” Share article \nThe A Word will be shot on location in The Lake District and also at Manchester’s Space Project.
