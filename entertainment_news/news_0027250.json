The stars hit headlines in August when they were spotted kissing at a Cincinnati, Ohio restaurant and last month, Drake was spotted cheering on Serena at the U.S. Open in New York. He also had a front row seat at the sportswoman's HSN Fashion Show during New York Fashion Week, while she returned the favour days later by joining the Started From The Bottom rapper at the opening of his new restaurant in Toronto. Earlier this week, reports surfaced alleging the rumoured couple had taken its relationship to the next level and gotten engaged, but Serena's spokesperson has denied they are even romantically involved.\"Serena Williams and Drake are not engaged,\" the rep tells GossipCop.com. \"They are simply longtime friends.\" Serena and Drake were previously linked in 2011, and he was courtside at Wimbledon in London earlier this summer, watching the tennis icon secure her sixth U.K. championship win and her 21st major title.
