More than 600 petition signatures would be needed to force a referendum, and the petitions would have to be filed by Oct. 26.\nPresta said if a referendum were required, it would not be held until March at the earliest, and Crestwood would find another, albeit more expensive, option such as a loan to get the settlement money.\nThe village would pay off the bonds over 12 to 16 years, Vince Cainkar, an attorney representing the village in the bond sale, said at the hearing. Unlike a general obligation bond sale that would be repaid via property tax revenue, Crestwood will use a fourth of the income from its local sales tax, or about $800,000 annually, to pay the principal and interest on the bonds, Cainkar said.\nKadner: The sorry history of Crestwood's water scandal Phil Kadner Everybody who worked in Crestwood knew you didn't question Mayor Chester Stranczek when he gave an order.\nSo when he told two employees to mix water from a contaminated well into the village's drinking supply, the employees not only followed the directive but were willing to file fraudulent paperwork...\nEverybody who worked in Crestwood knew you didn't question Mayor Chester Stranczek when he gave an order.\nSo when he told two employees to mix water from a contaminated well into the village's drinking supply, the employees not only followed the directive but were willing to file fraudulent paperwork...\n(Phil Kadner) He said the actual sale of the bonds would start sometime next month and probably wrap up by early December. The village wants to finish the sale before a potential interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board, which would make retiring the debt more costly.\nCrestwood last fall paid $50,000 to settle a lawsuit by the Illinois attorney general's office over the use of the well water, which was tainted with vinyl chloride, a known carcinogen.\nVillage officials told residents and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency that it was using only Lake Michigan water after 1985, when the contaminated well was discovered, but regulators later learned that Crestwood continued to use the well for as much as 20 percent of its water supply from 1985 to 2007.\nVillage officials have steadfastly denied that residents' health was in jeopardy, although many of the lawsuits have blamed the use of the well water for illnesses including kidney problems, tumors, different types of cancer and immune system disorders.\n$15M payout eyed in Crestwood water scandal suits Mike Nolan Crestwood officials are eyeing a $15 million payout to settle lawsuits filed by hundreds of current and former residents that allege they or family members were harmed by the village's longtime use of a contaminated well to help supply drinking water in the south suburb.\nResolving the lawsuits...\nCrestwood officials are eyeing a $15 million payout to settle lawsuits filed by hundreds of current and former residents that allege they or family members were harmed by the village's longtime use of a contaminated well to help supply drinking water in the south suburb.\nResolving the lawsuits...\n(Mike Nolan) After the well's use was revealed, the IEPA said the public's health was never at risk, but the U.S. EPA has said there is no such thing as a safe exposure level to vinyl chloride, a chemical used in dry cleaning.\nPresta said Friday that, should the village have to get voter approval for the bond issue, Crestwood would take another route, possibly a bank loan that could carry a higher interest rate. But he's confident the lawsuits will be resolved.\n\"We're going to still settle the lawsuits,\" he said.\nBesides the bond money, Crestwood would use $3 million in current village funds as well as $3 million from insurance to cover the settlement..\nmnolan@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55fc9fa0/turbine/ct-sta-crestwood-water-lawsuits-st-0920-20150918", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56041e55/turbine/ct-sta-kadner-crestwood-water-st-0924-20150924", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56195f25/turbine/ct-sta-crestwood-lawsuits-bonds-st-1011-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:23:04.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
