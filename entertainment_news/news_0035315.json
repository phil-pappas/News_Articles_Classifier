Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling for Rushdie's death in 1989, and the book is widely banned across the Muslim world. \nIran has offered a $3 million reward for anyone who kills Rushdie. It also said it would boycott this year's Frankfurt Book Fair over a planned opening speech by the India-born British novelist. Rate this This article has not yet been rated.
