We expect it to calm down later in the day.\" \nAn Odeon spokesman said: \"We're seeing massive traffic to our website this morning as guests book ahead for Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. \n\"We knew this morning would be very busy and did as much as we could to prepare. Thousands of guests have already successfully bought their tickets. \n\"There have been some booking delays in the initial peak, but our website is now returning to normal speed.\" \nAilsa Scott said on Twitter : \"Is 'I'm sorry, I was trying to book Star Wars tickets but the Odeon site kept crashing' a valid excuse for being late for work?\" \nJoel Tennant added : \"The Force is not strong with the Odeon website today. Took Yoda's advice too literally they did; load or do not, there is no try.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:08:20.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
