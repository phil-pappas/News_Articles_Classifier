He counts his acting and dancing talents as well as his singing skill as his edge over the rest. He was, in fact, supposed to perform in Kuh Ledesma’s forthcoming concert but begged off because of “StarStruck.”\nAyra believes her edge over the others is her being hard-working. “I know my objective and I will pursue it.” Avery noted his persistence and character are key to his success. Klea, on the other hand, said, “It’s my determination and my hunger to do the best I can.”\nJames considers himself hardworking and always puts the best effort in what he does. “At may mga undiscovered qualities pa ako,” he added.\nThe other finalists are: Analyn Barro, Kevin Sagra, Princess Guevarra, Arra San Agustin, Joemarie Nielsen, James Teng, Elyson de Dios, Jay Arcilla, and Liezel Lopez.\n“StarStruck” airs weekdays before “24 Oras” on GMA.\n• • •\nCELEBS AT KANTORI YAKITORI OPENING\nParañaque MayoR Edwin Olivarez, Sampaguita and Azenith Briones with Joe Reyes, Kelly Parreno and Keitaro Chida\nPolitical and showbiz celebrities were special guests during the recent opening of Kantori Yakitori Rest.
