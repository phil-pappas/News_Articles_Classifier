Good thinking. Maybe she could take Justin Bieber with her. \n\"I'm going to ... I don't know. Hang out with my friends. Write new music. Maybe not write new music. I don't know,\" she said.

I hear it's nice this time of year. Justin Bieber would probably love it. \nSwift also said when she does try following up the massive success of her \"1989\" album, she won't obsess with trying to outdo herself. \n\"N . How could the next one be as big?\" she asked. \"Maybe the next album will be a bridge to somewhere else. Or maybe I'll just go ahead and change everything.\" \nShe also talked about being so high profile. \n\"I'm in the news every single day for multiple different reasons,\" she said. \"And it can feel, at times, if you let your anxiety get the better of you, like everybody's waiting for you to really mess up -- and then you'll be done.\" \nThat must be tough.
