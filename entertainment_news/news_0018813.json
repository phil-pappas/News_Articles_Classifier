Holly Rubenstein reports.   \nSo if you haven't got the message, John Cleese, one of the five surviving members of Monty Python wants you to celebrate the \"Holy Grail's\" 40th anniversary. On Wednesday October 14th, for one night only, a special singalong version of the classic comedy will be shown in UK cinemas nationwide. SOUNDBITE Actor, Michael Palin, saying (English): \"In an odd way \"Holy Grail\" was, you know, a bit of a risk when we made the movie. We didn't have much money. We got a bit of money from various pop groups but it was made on the cheap and it was a bit of a gamble.\" SOUNDBITE Actor, Terry Gilliam, saying (English): \"The surprise was in New York, and that's the image was New York when we'd get up in the morning and everybody was saying \"You've got to look what's going on in the cinema\" and there was a queue going all the way around the block.\"  //reut.rs/1ZzZmrO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:51:22.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
