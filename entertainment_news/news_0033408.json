It took a year and a half to arrange the rights and secure guest teacher-coaches from Cuba to train the company in the requisite Romantic style. \nIt's unfair, of course, to compare a regional company such as this to all the other prestigious companies' \"Giselles\" I've seen. But after the curtain rose on a bucolic village scene filled with dancers in lovely costumes, it became clear this troupe is looking better than ever. \nBringing in the Cuban experts has paid off handsomely. Clean footwork, crisp ensemble dancing and a distinct adoption of the softer, more rounded arms of the Romantic style are among the hard-won results. \nAlonso's choreography also features the satisfying inclusion of many more details in the narrative, full-bodied dances for the peasants in the first act and for the wilis in the second, as well as more dramatic complexity to the relationships involving Giselle and Albrecht and Hilarion the latter as competitors for her attentions. Advertisement \nReplacing the traditional peasant pas de deux with a pas de dix (comprising six women and four men) allowed the dancers to be much more than mere background decoration and to demonstrate a sense of community, as the village entertains visiting nobility. \nIn the opening performance, Brett Bauer played Albrecht, partnering Alexsandra Meijer as Giselle. His youthful demeanor and nuanced acting underlined his ardent love for the peasant girl -- and his failure, like Romeo's, to understand that by crossing deeply ingrained social boundaries, his romantic attraction to Giselle could cause a tragedy. \nBauer made Albrecht's remorse while mourning Giselle at her grave seem genuine. But the dancer, who's tall and long-limbed, could use some advice on extending his movements to their fullest within the constraints of a stage filled with scenery. \nMeijer's sunny, vibrant Giselle was perhaps a tad too energetic for this fragile maiden with a weak heart, who is warned against dancing too much by her protective mother. However, Meijer redeemed herself in the mad scene, after Giselle learns of Albrecht's duplicity in presenting himself as a peasant, rather than a member of the nobility, has been exposed. \nProgressively moving from heartbreak to losing touch with reality, Meijer's Giselle adds chilling touches -- such as pulling her tresses over her face, showing the audience trembles in her fingers that then travel up her arms and displaying a completely vacant expression as she faces the entire village. \nThe ballet's second act is the ultimate test for a ballerina, who must portray an ethereal being with feet that barely seem to touch the floor. Meijer's performance again could have been helped by a softer approach, as could Amy Marie Briones' in the role of Myrtha. They have the technique to execute the steps well, but must learn to disguise their efforts under a gossamer facade. \nThe entire company could benefit by dancing \"Giselle\" a dozen more times, so the dancers could become truly comfortable and the choreography's Romantic style completely natural. They have worked hard, and deserve the chance to fulfill their full potential. \nBut Silicon Valley Ballet is caught in a Catch-22. Without financial resources to expand the season and hire more dancers with full-year contracts, the troupe can't flourish. And without growing artistically, it can't attract funding. I hope some potential donors out there understand what is at stake here, and help Silicon Valley Ballet get on a sound footing. \nUnfortunately visa problems prevented Carreño's brother, Yoel Carreño, from dancing Friday as a guest artist in the role of Albrecht, as initially announced. \nThat left José Carreño, debuting as Hilarion, and three corps de ballet members from Havana to represent the Cuban lineage of this production. Also disappointing was the company's use of recorded, rather than live, music. This particular ballet -- and historic first American production incorporating Alonso's vision -- really demanded musicians in the pit.
