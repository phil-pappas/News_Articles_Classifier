Book and lyrics by George Haimsohn and Robin Miller. Directed by Randy Skinner.\nWith Eloise Kropp, Lesli Margherita, John Bolton, Mara Davi, Cary Tedder and Danny Gardner.\nSchedule: 7 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday; 8 p.m. Friday; 2 and 7 p.m. Wednesday; 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday; 3 p.m. Sunday.\nTickets: $67 to $154.50. 212-239-6200 or telecharge.com.\nFor good and ill, \"Dames at Sea\" offers a very streamlined theatrical experience.\nThe show, which opened Thursday night at the Helen Hayes Theatre, is making its Broadway debut, having taken much, much longer to reach the Great White Way than its heroine, Ruby, who achieves theatrical stardom on the same day she arrives on the bus from Utah, penniless and unknown.\nPlot points come and go very quickly in the musical, a frothy, small-scale parody of big Depression Era films like \"42nd Street\" that began its life in a Greenwich Village coffee house in the mid-'60s and went on to become an off-Broadway hit and subsequent favorite for regional and amateur presentations.\nThis production, directed and choreographed by Randy Skinner, always seems eager to get to the next song-and-dance number, and there's something oddly refreshing about its willingness to dispense with what are usually considered narrative necessities.\nAfter Ruby (Eloise Kropp) shows up at a theater, looking for chorus work, she meets Dick (Cary Tedder), a sailor, and they instantly fall in love. There are no tedious, predictable courtship scenes.\nRuby quickly nabs a job, thanks to her new best friend, the savvy chorus girl Joan (Mara Davi). Joan's boyfriend Lucky (Danny Gardner) is, coincidentally, a crewman on the same battleship as Dick.\nWe also meet Mona Kent (Lesli Margherita), the demanding leading lady whose role is taken by Ruby after Mona becomes sick on the show's opening night on the battleship, where it was moved after its Broadway theater was torn down.\nThe other characters are the show's frazzled director and the ship's captain (both played by John Bolton), who's in love with Mona.\nPresenting the story as a series of rapid, jokey moments does have its downside, though.\nAs entertaining as musical numbers might be – and several in \"Dames at Sea\" are charming — what essentially connects us to a show is its plot. It provides the conflict, the obstacles to be overcome, that get us involved, wondering what will happen next.\nWithout that, the experience becomes a series of individual numbers rather than a satisfyingly cohesive whole.\nIn \"Dames at Sea,\" there's so little separation between musical routines, they acquire a rote-like quality, especially with the overload of tap-dancing, which is resolutely inserted wherever possible.\nThere are several numbers that do stand out, though, in a pastiche score made up of songs that remind you of other songs whose titles you can't quite remember. They include \"It's You\" and, particularly, \"Raining in My Heart,\" which is given a lovely showcase.\nThe cast is mostly fine, with singing and dancing rather than acting its main duties. Kropp is a fiercely good tapper, and engaging, as well. And Bolton provides some well-timed humor in his dual roles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:29:19.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
