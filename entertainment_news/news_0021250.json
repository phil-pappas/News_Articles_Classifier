Kring-Kring Gonzales running for mayor? By MST Entertainment | Oct. 12, 2015 at 05:40pm \nActress-turned-entrepreneur and public servant Cristina “Kring-Kring” Gonzales-Romualdez may run in the mayoral race as the succesor to her husband, present mayor of Tacloban City Alfred Romualdez. Kring Kring Gonzales reveals her beauty secrets \nKring is very busy as the Commission on Elections set Oct. 12 to 16 as filing of certificates of candidacy for those running in the 2016 elections, from President down to Local Government posts. \nBut she does not look a bit haggard. Kring-Kring is as radiant and beautiful as ever; she looks as young as she was during her rise to fame in the ‘90s. \n“My secret to looking young? Number one, my love for and faith in God. He has always and continues to bless me, my family and my constituents. Number two, ClearTight,” reveals Cristina. \nClearTight Laser is a state-of-the-art, non-ablative treatment that improves fine lines and wrinkles,and lightens the skin. \n“Just after one session, I saw significant improvement on my problem areas -- tightening of the neck and diminished lines around the mouth. There is also visible improvement around the eyes. I like it since I can attend to my work without any redness on my face,” she says. \nThis modern procedure is an alternative to traditional skin resurfacing and surgical facelifts as it does away with expensive, time-consuming surgery. A unique handpiece treats hard-to-reach areas traditional ablative lasers can’t touch. It produces heat beneath the skin to reduce pain or discomfort. \n“ClearTight delivers photo acoustic shockwaves to the target area through high laser intensities in nanosecond pulses. It stimulates the collagen under the skin, offering controlled dermal shrinking that tightens the skin,” says Dr. Jean Marquez, founder of The Skin Specialist who has been doing laser treatments for 15 years already. \n“ClearTight is good for busy women like Kring, women who can’t afford to have any downtime such as redness and swelling but want to see immediate results. It is also for those who have loose and wrinkled skin around the eyes, forehead, around the mouth, neck, hands, underarms, elbows and knees. Kring needs ClearTight especially because she is always exposed to the sun in her work so she is prone to photoaging,” says Dr. Marquez.
