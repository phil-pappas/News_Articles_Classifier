Photo: Dallas Kilponen \nSydney Symphony Orchestra. \nSydney Opera House, October 9 \nReviewed by Peter McCallum \nFour stars \nAdvertisement The sound of a violin is elusive yet distinctive.\nWith apologies to wine writers, the sound of the 1757 instrument by the great Italian maker  Giovanni Battista Guadagnini,​ that has been loaned to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra by generous patron Vicki Olsson,​ proved to be warm and humane with a hint of glowing astringency.\nConcertmaster Andrew Haveron​ gave the violin a comprehensive inauguration, taking it through the coaxing, beguiling and intensely reflective first movement of Walton's Violin Concerto, the agitated flaring brightness of the second movement and the lusty energy of the finale.\nThen, just in case the instrument still retained undisclosed secrets, he played the fearsomely difficult Fuga from Bartok's Sonata for solo violin by way of encore.\nThrough all this, the instrument radiated mellow richness with an edge to the sound that was at once soft, yet etched with sufficient precision to give bracing definition to virtuosic passages in the later movements of the Walton concerto and to Bartok's darker modernist colours.\nBut chief honour must also go to Haveron who played with masterly command, sculpting the music in smooth arcs polished to a high professional finish.\nRecent exposure of the late Peter Sculthorpe's​ music has focused on the richly coloured style initiated with Mangrove (1979). In this concert's opening work, it was interesting to return to the arresting stridency of Sun Music II , from one of the modernist scores that made his name in the mid-1960s.\nConductor David Robertson and the SSO under leader Dene Olding​ projected its shrieking string dissonances, brutal percussion and strangely ritualistic woodwind with uncompromising fierceness.\nIn the first movement of Sibelius's Symphony No. 2 in D after interval, Robertson stressed continuity without lingering on the mosaic-like detail – the metaphor was one the composer himself used for his Fifth Symphony – of its many themes.\nSibelius forges his finale from two strong but expressively contrasted themes – one majestically elated, the other implacably stern.\nHe makes scant attempt to bring them into resolution beyond some brief references by way of peroration at the close and the SSO and Robertson laid out the chasm between them with thrilling magnificence, starkness and awe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:12:17.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
