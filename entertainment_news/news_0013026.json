Apple picking marks fall arrival for many By Amanda Gray   Posted on Oct 9, 2015 by Amanda Gray \nFor locals, a taste for fresh apples, apple cider and warm apple pie is a short car ride away. \nThe Apple Patch is a humble little orchard with a big heart for classic apples in North Liberty. \nOwners Bill and Sue Dittmar opened the orchard nine years ago, but have lived on the land for 43 years. Sue says she worked for an apple orchard for more than 20 years before she finally decided to open her own place. \nBill is retired, and Sue currently serves as the Liberty Township trustee. The Apple Patch is open in the spring for u-pick strawberries and in the fall, from about Labor Day weekend through October, for u-pick apples. \nThey offer 22 different varieties of apples — but some of those may be two varieties of the same breed, Sue adds, citing the two varieties of Jonathan apples they offer. Those are her favorite apples, but the orchard offers many varieties you might not see elsewhere, including such classic but oft-forgotten breeds as Northern Spy, Grimes Golden and Winesap. \nSue suggests that you call ahead if you want to know when specific varieties will be available. Some breeds, such as Gala, are already gone for the season. Others are just hitting their peaks now and in the next few weeks. This year’s crop is a little smaller than average because of cold temperatures during blooming season, Dittmar says, but ripened well in recent weeks. \nBeyond apples, you may see some beehives in the back of the orchard. The honeybees are from a local beekeeper and are no threat to humans, but rather help pollinate the apple trees and produce tasty honey sold at the farm. \nSue says she loves seeing the children learn about the farming process by visiting the U-pick farm. With their proximity to Potato Creek State Park, the Dittmars see a lot of families from Chicago with children that haven’t ever seen a working farm before visiting. \n“It’s just wonderful to share with them and to watch their reactions,” she says, strolling through the trees. \nKercher’s Orchard is also open for u-pick apples again. The 100-plus-year-old, fifth-generation farm is located in Goshen. This is the time for family trips and nearly 5,000 school children coming on field trips, owner Maureen Kercher — known to many as “Mrs. Apple” — says. She also says that seeing the children learn about the farming process makes it worthwhile to her. \n“To me, this is what fall is all about. We are a family farm that opens our doors two months out of the year to families,” Kercher says. \nShe jokes that everyone’s welcome, except for the family dog — Kercher’s doesn’t allow pets on the farm property. \nThey offer 10 varieties of apples for u-pick, but grow 20 varieties on the farm that go to local stores such as Martin’s Super Market and Whole Foods, among others. If you see “Sunrise Orchards” on something locally, that’s from Kercher’s. \nKercher says this year was a good year for them for apples, with the most popular variety being Golden Delicious. Many pickers ask for it when they come in. Families make it a tradition to come back every year — sometimes even a few weekends out of the fall. \nStacy Gardner from Elkhart was out at Kercher’s with her 4-year-old son, Wyatt Lester, toting a big basket of apples down the orchard’s rows. \n“We came out because it’s a beautiful day,” she says. “I think it’s great. It benefits the community, and all of the money you spend here stays locally.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:55:39.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
