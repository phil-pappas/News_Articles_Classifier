I never go to the gym. And I love to eat chocolate and pasta. I'm not obsessed with being skinny.'' \nAlthough Monica has become famous for her natural beauty and sex appeal, she originally studied to become a lawyer as she ''wanted to pursue a serious occupation because there is a lot of pressure being considered an attractive woman in Italy.'' \nAnd despite ditching that career to become a model and actress, the brunette beauty has claimed she still doesn't obsess over her appearance. \nShe told the Daily Mirror newspaper: ''I don't stress myself about my looks. I love to laugh. I like being able to lead an interesting life.'' \nMeanwhile, the 'Malena' star has confessed she's thrilled she was chosen to play Bond's older love interest, even if actor Daniel Craig is only four years younger than her in real life. \nShe added: ''It's important to show that a woman at 50 can be just as interesting and Â­attractive as a woman who is 30.''
