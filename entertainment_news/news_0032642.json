So down to earth that, if you see her on the red carpet, she'll probably be wearing an ensemble from Forever 21 and earrings from Claire's. \nSo she claims in her new stand-up special, \"Anjelah Johnson: Not Fancy,\" coming to Netflix on Friday. \nIt's the second Netflix production for Johnson, a former Oakland Raiders cheerleader who was born and raised in San Jose and moved to Southern California in 2005 to chase her showbiz dreams. \nIn the one-hour special, Johnson, 33, finds the funny in subjects ranging from growing up in a large Mexican-American family to traveling through Europe on a very smelly train with her husband. San Jose native Anjelah Johnson stars in a new standup special coming to Netflix on Oct. 2, 2015. (Netflix) \nFilmed at the City National Grove of Anaheim, the show presents her doing impressions of European Gypsies and Vietnamese manicurists and breaking down the differences between \"cholo church\" and \"regular church.\" \nJohnson, who attended De Anza College, was a cast member of \"MADtv\" and has done guest appearances in TV shows, including \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Ugly Betty.\" She's co-developing a show for ABC Family. \nTHE DOCTOR IS IN: After a career of mainly supporting roles, Ken Jeong becomes a leading man in the sitcom \"Dr. Ken\" (8:30 p.m. Friday, ABC), starring as a physician and father of two. Both kids are played by Bay Area natives -- Albert Tsai and Krista Marie Yu. Advertisement \nTsai, who grew up in San Jose, will be familiar to fans of the short-lived sitcom \"Trophy Wife,\" a role for which he won raves. He also had a couple of hilarious guest stints on \"Fresh Off the Boat.\" \nYu was born in Berkeley, where she spent much of her childhood singing, dancing and figure skating (she was a big fan of Kristi Yamaguchi). She recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Drama with a B.F.A. in acting. \nDIGITAL CRIME FIGHTER: Concord native Charley Koontz may not be a computer genius, but he plays one on TV. Koontz returns to the screen this weekend, as \"CSI: Cyber\" (10 p.m. Sunday, CBS) launches its second season. \nThe De La Salle High School grad plays FBI agent Daniel Krumitz on the show, which welcomes Ted Danson to the cast this fall. Koontz has a juicy storyline right off the bat, testifying as a character witness for his sister (Angela Trimbur), who killed the their parents' murderer. \nFollow Chuck Barney at Twitter.com/chuckbarney and Facebook.com/bayareanewsgroup.chuckbarney .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:10:11.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
