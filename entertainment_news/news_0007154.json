The album is now available for digital and physical pre-order.\nNew York, NY (PRWEB) October 01, 2015\nGRAMMY® nominated electronic musician Armin van Buuren will release his sixth and latest full-length studio album, EMBRACE (Armada Music) on October 29th, 2015. The full tracklist of the album will be revealed today during the 733rd episode of Armin’s weekly A State of Trance (ASOT) radio show. The weekly two-hour ASOT radio show is currently heard by more than 33 million listeners on 100 FM radio stations in 84 countries. Beginning today, EMBRACE will be available for digital pre-order; the physical pre-order has been available since September 3rd.\nTruly a remarkable and comprehensive work-of-art, EMBRACE is quite possibly Armin’s best creative effort to date. With more than 17 years as a professional DJ and producer to his credit, Armin has developed a finely honed ability to create the most dynamic music. It’s music that’s as aurally stimulating as it is emotionally dense.\nEMBRACE includes genre-shattering collaborations. They include a number of brand-new collaborations between Armin and: the Dutch jazz trumpeter, Eric Vloeimans (“Embrace”); singer/songwriter Cimo Fränkel (“Strong Ones”); popular Dutch band, Kensington (“Heading Up High”); and fellow GRAMMY® nominee, Gavin DeGraw (“Looking For Your Name”). The first two singles from EMBRACE are out now: “Another You” featuring Mr. Probz and “Off The Hook” with Hardwell.\nSaid Armin of the stylistic diversity of his EMBRACE album, “Each of the instruments you see on the album cover – which was shot by Anton Corbijn – was an instrument actually used on the album! I thought it would be a real challenge to myself to try to create dance music using all of these disparate instruments. I really wanted to push myself past my comfort zone and create something very exciting not just for me, but for all the lovers of music out there. I hope you enjoy it.” Judging by the ecstatic reaction of audiences whenever Armin plays his album cuts onstage, he has, once again, succeeded.\nWatch the world-premiere of “Embrace,” the title track of the album, live at TomorrowWorld (September 27th): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTfv8Hy24w8 .\nPre-order EMBRACE, the album: http://ArmadaMusic.lnk.to/AVBEmbrace\nTracklist for EMBRACE (Armada Music), full album:\n01 Embrace (feat.
