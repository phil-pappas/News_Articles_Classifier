The plug-in also contains a publishing service that allows photographers to synchronize their Lightroom collections with their ImageRights account. The collections are then automatically updated with the latest USCO registration information. In doing so ImageRights has transformed Adobe Lightroom into a complete copyright management information solution that is fully synchronized with the U.S. Copyright Office.\nAs Chris Reed, attorney, photographer, and author of Copyright Workflow for Photographers observes, â€œphotographers fail to register their works timely due to the lack of an efficient mechanism to export copyright management information from their existing workflow software to the Copyright Office registration application. ImageRights has, in a stroke, eliminated this significant barrier that has historically deterred photographers from protecting their copyrights to the full extent of U.S. copyright law, and led to gaping holes in the public record of copyright ownership.\"\nUnder U.S. law, registration is required for copyright owners to be eligible to receive statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, and possible recovery of attorney's fees, without which it is very difficult for attorneys to litigate an infringement case. Photographers lose out on millions of dollars every year for the simple reason that they fail to register their photos with the U.S. Copyright Office.\nThroughout the registration process, the ImageRights plug-in updates the metadata of the images in Lightroom with the current registration status. Once the certificate of registration is issued by the USCO, the plug-in updates the images with the copyright registration number and registration date. ImageRights also inscribes a URL into the metadata that links to a webpage that displays the image along with its copyright registration information. Since the USCO does not provide a searchable image database, the link provided by ImageRights can be used by photographers, prospective licensees, and infringers to quickly and easily ascertain the copyright registration information.\nPricing and Availability\nThe ImageRights Plug-in for Adobe Lightroom is immediately available as a free download from ImageRights at imagerights.com/plugins. Use of the plug-in does require that the photographer sign up for at least the free ImageRights Basic account.\nImageRights charges $69 or $89 per USCO registration filing depending upon the type of registration submitted. These prices are inclusive of the $35 or $55 eCO filing fee charged by the USCO.\nPhotographers who upgrade to ImageRights Pro ($495/year) or ImageRights Premier ($1,295/year) will receive 3 or 5 free USCO registration filings per year, respectively.
