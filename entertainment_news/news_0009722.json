All they have really is the Kardashians. Is that a great message for little girls? A whole family of women who take faces they were born with as a light suggestion?\" \nAmy also referenced Khloe Kardashian's dramatic weight loss, claiming that Khloe used to be the most down to earth of the family before she \"lost half her body weight\". \nShe added: \"We used to have Khloe. Khloe was ours, right? Whenever there's a group of women, you identify with one of them...but then Khloe, she lost half her body weight. She lost a Kendall! We have nothing. I want good role models.\" \nDuring the hilarious opening monologue, Amy also joked she is dating Bradley Cooper and recalled a conversation with Hillary Clinton, where she asked the politician about her alcohol preferences. amy schumer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:14:11.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
