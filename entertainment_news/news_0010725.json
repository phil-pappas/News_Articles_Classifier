At some point pretty quickly, conditions became untenable and we had to retreat from the structure.”\nAccording to officials, the roof collapsed, and much of the top floor was gutted.\n“I would say the building is a total loss,” Bush said.\nAuthorities used a Pace bus to keep residents warm as crews battled the blaze.\nAccording to Bush, one firefighter was transported to an area hospital for “non-life threatening injuries.” None of the building’s residents were injured, Bush said.\nCrews remained on the scene Wednesday morning battling hot spots, Bush said, and fire investigators planned to visit the site later in the day to determine a cause.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Fires", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56277dde/turbine/ct-oak-park-apartment-fire-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:25:21.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
