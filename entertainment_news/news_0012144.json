In this episode, Oliver will become more of strategist with him running for Mayor of Star City. Laurel flirts with the dark side as she persuades Thea to go to Nanda Parbat in a bid to resurrect her dead sister, Sara. Oliver and Diggle continue to have problems with each other. FACEBOOK/ Arrow Arrow \nThe official synopsis of the episode goes: \"The growing tension between Oliver (Stephen Amell) and Diggle (David Ramsey) puts both their lives at risk when they go after Damien Darhk (guest star Neal McDonough) and a H.I.V.E. deployed meta-human. Meanwhile, Laurel (Katie Cassidy) talks Thea (Willa Holland) into returning to Nanda Parbat to ask her father (John Barrowman) to put Sara (guest star Caity Lotz) into the Lazarus Pit. However, Laurel is surprised when Nyssa (guest star Katrina Law) refuses to do it.\" \nThe episode will see Laurel trying to bring back Sara, her sister, from the dead. The previous episode had her opening Sara's grave and viewers saw the barely decomposed body of Sara. \nIn spite of knowing that using the Lazarus Pit and resurrecting Sara will have side effects, just like Thea becoming violent and unreasonably aggressive, Laurel is blinded by her love for her sister. She asks Thea to go with her as they try to find out what really happened to her at the Lazarus Pit. \nThis plot point sets the ground for Laurel coming under the influence of the \"darker forces,\" while Oliver is trying to shake off his terrible past and do what is right. This is also the episode where \"Constantine\" shows up. Will it be Constantine who will help Laurel turn Sara into the \"White Canary?\" \nAccording to the photos posted by The CW, a new villain has debuted. It is Double Down a.k.a. Jeremy Tell, who is played by J.R. Bourne. \n\"Arrow\" airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on The CW. The episode \"Restoration\" will air on October 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:36:47.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
