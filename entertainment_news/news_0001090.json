He started as a news cadet in 1966 and was a press secretary to Gough Whitlam after he left government. During his career O'Brien has won six Walkley Awards including the Gold Walkley. He was the founding presenter of Lateline and then the long‐time presenter of 7.30 Report. He currently hosts Four Corners on ABC Television. \nDetails of event Kerry O'Brien in conversation with Barrie Cassidy The Byron Theatre, Wednesday, November 11, 6pm. Tickets $15.
