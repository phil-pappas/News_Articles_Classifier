This year, over 30,000 new books were placed on Indigo's bookshelves and into the hands of their expert booksellers. A dedicated committee of members from head office and staff from stores pored over these titles to discuss and champion the books they loved most. Over the course of the year, staff swapped favourite titles, shared insights and engaged in fervent debates. The result is their official selection of carefully curated titles – a list of books that many customers already know and love, and hidden gems that are waiting to be discovered.\n\"Books are thriving. We're thrilled to see a real return to reading and the physical book. This list is a concrete representation of the love we have for the written word, the power of stories in our lives and our desire to share with our customers the absolute best books we can find,\" said Bahram Olfati , SVP of Print at Indigo. \"Canadians are hungry for insight on what their next great read will be, and we know our customers will love this selection of books as much as we do.\"\nThe Indigo book team knows a hit when they see one. When one of Indigo's buyers read an advance copy of Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train , they knew from the outset that it was something special. Globally, The Girl on The Train has been one of the most successful books of the year, topping international bestseller lists, and earning its place as Indigo's Book of the Year for 2015.\nIndigo's 10 Best Books of 2015\n#1. The Girl on the Train – Paula Hawkins\nAs a bookseller, you are often told \"this book is the next big thing,\" but in the case of The Girl on the Train the label was actually fitting. We loved it immediately, and knew our readers would too. Thrilling and \"unputdownable,\" it is the book that we relished more than any other in 2015.\n- Kristi Reilly , Category Manager, Fiction Buyer\n#2. Furiously Happy – Jenny Lawson\nMore ridiculous adventures with the author of Let's Pretend this Never Happened . You'll laugh out loud, cry a bit and get even closer to one of the funniest women in social media.\n- Michael Nicholson , Category Manager, Non Fiction Buyer\n#3. Dead Wake – Erik Larson\nA compelling, enrapturing read! I knew how it had to end, but the intimate details, exposed secrets and the vibrant, visual narrative had me praying that maybe this time it would stay afloat.\n- Dominic Stones , Category Manager, Bargain Buyer\n#4. The Library at Mount Char – Scott Hawkins\nDark, demented, and drop-dead funny, Scott Hawkins' twisted fantasy morality play is the best genre debut in years!\n- Brandon Forsyth , Allocations Analyst, Kids & Lifestyle\n#5. Stranger Than We Can Imagine – John Higgs\nA Bill Bryson -esque romp through the twentieth century. Forget the Wars and the Berlin Wall. This is all about relativity, TV, sex, and SciFi. The big ideas that blew up the century... and held it together.\n- Andrew Taubman , Category Manager, Non Fiction Online\n#6. We Should All Be Feminists – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\nIn concise yet powerful words, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie describes how we can achieve equality among the sexes. She will make you believe that change is possible with her passionate voice and indomitable spirit.\n- Nadine Pierce , Allocations Analyst, Fiction & Non Fiction\n#7. Humans of New York : Stories – Brandon Stanton\nIt may sound clichéd, but Humans of New York : Stories makes you feel human. Flipping through these pages will have you giggling and in tears. Humbling and touching, it is a testament to the sorrows and strengths of humanity.\n- Chelsey Catterall , Inventory Analyst, Fiction\n#8. Hausfrau – Jill Alexander Essbaum\nSeductive and thought-provoking, Hausfrau is an insightful character study into a modern-day Anna Karenina . Love her or hate her, you'll definitely want to talk about her.\n- Chihoe Ho , Category Manager, Fiction Online\n#9. Our Souls at Night – Kent Haruf\nThe message in Kent Haruf's last book is clear, and consistent with all his other work. Live life. Live it today. Live it as if all your actions are eternal.\n- Bahram Olfati , Senior Vice President, Print\n#10. Nimona – Noelle Stevenson\nA spirited story of a shape-shifting girl with a powerful message about the importance of friendship and loyalty, but also enough mayhem and hilarity to keep the action going!\n- Gabriella Parro , Inventory Team Manager, Kids\nFor the full list please visit: http://www.indigo.ca/books/best-of-2015/\nAbout Indigo\nWith books always at our heart and soul at Indigo we are about telling stories and creating experiences.
