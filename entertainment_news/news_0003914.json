It wasn't working. In their four months together, they went through a lot: Rosie's father died, her daughter [Chelsea] ran away, there was a lot of of tumult. It was too much. \n\"Tatum wouldn't mind meeting a nice girl. She is back on the market.\" \nThe former 'The View' co-host, who filed for divorce from second wife Michelle Rounds in February following their split last November, was spotted on a date with Tatum at the Broadway musical 'Hamilton' together in early August and they were later seen enjoying dinner at Da Silvano in New York City. \nAn insider said at the time: \"They aren't quite ready to go public with their romance. They've known each other for a while, but the secrecy of their dating has made it more exciting.\" \nTatum, who has three children, Kevin, 29, Emily, 24, and Sean, 27, with retired tennis player John, opened up about her sexuality in the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, writing: \"In a the physical sense, I'm not attracted to men right now at all. \n\"Dating women is exciting to me, and this is turning me on.\" \n\"I dated in the heterosexual world up until about four years ago, when I started thinking about dating women - just thinking about it.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:04:48.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
