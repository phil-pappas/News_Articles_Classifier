Bonding time? \nBut they’ve also been getting down to some hard work in rehearsal rooms across the country. Here’s how the couples have been getting on: Anita Rani and Gleb Savchenko \nAnita and Gleb are dancing the Tango to Temper Trap’s Sweet Disposition – although Gleb had to go on a coffee run for his celebrity partner. May be it take two to tango but @itsanitarani can't tango without a coffee @bbcstrictly #teamGLITA pic.twitter.com/A7aNALUqhg \n— GLEB SAVCHENKO (@Gleb_Savchenko) October 21, 2015 \nBut it’s not just coffee that’s on her mind: All I think about is dancing and food #strictly \n— anita rani (@itsanitarani) October 22, 2015 \nAnita has also been fraternising with the competition – hanging out with Jay on London’s South Bank. \nAnd she’s clearly been making Gleb work hard, according to this sweaty selfie captioned: “Rehearsals done for today.” Carol Kirkwood and Pasha Kovalev \nCarol and Pasha are dancing the Viennese Waltz to Seal’s I’ve Been Loving You Too Long – although Carol will have to overcome her “discombobulation” first, after this very sweet conversation with Bryan Adams.
