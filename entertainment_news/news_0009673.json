He announced in a Facebook post earlier this week that three dates on his joint tour with fellow country superstar Merle Haggard were no longer scheduled to take place as planned because he'd \"been feeling under the weather.\" The three shows include ones that were supposed to happen in Florence, SC on October 15 and in Roanoke, VA on October 16. The former has been rescheduled for April next year while the latter is now slated for Monday, October 19. Also affected is the Reading, PA date initially set for October 17 which has been canceled entirely. \"All tickets will be honored for the new dates. Refunds are available at point of purchase for fans who will not be able to attend the new date,\" Nelson added in his post. Nelson and Haggard are touring together in support of their duets album \" Django and Jimmie \". No clear details regarding Nelson's condition have been revealed, but Senior Marketing Manager of the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina Nick Hooker has been told that the star's illnes \"is not life-threatening, but will require several weeks to fully recover.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:49:28.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
