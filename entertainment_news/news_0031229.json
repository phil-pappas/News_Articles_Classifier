On Wednesday the singer posted on Instagram a 15-second preview starring a group of female dancers, reports aceshowbiz.com. However, the Canadian pop star is nowhere to be seen in the sneak-peek. \nInstead, the dancers take the spotlight with their bright-coloured outfits while making some energetic choreographed moves as the track plays in the background. A collaboration with Skrillex and Blood Diamonds, “Sorry” is scheduled for release on Friday, as the second single off Bieber’s new album “Purpose” that’s due out on November 13. \nBieber, 22, took to Instagram with a sweet message for Odom, reported Hollywood Life. ”We all believe in you! Praying for you Lamar,” Bieber captioned his Instagram, a joyous picture of Odom beaming on the basketball court back when he played for the Lakers. \nThe 35-year-old basketball star recently regained consciousness after collapsing at a brothel in Nevada earlier this week and Bieber is the latest star to take to social media to reach out to Odom. Bieber is far from the Odom’s friends and fans from the NBA have sent truckloads of presents to his hospital room. He has received so many cards, balloons and cool presents that it is “beginning to look like Christmas” in his room. Odom’s estranged wife Khloe, 31, has been with him since he was admitted to hospital and has barely left his side. \n  7:28 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:11:20.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
