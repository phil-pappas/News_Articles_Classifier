I didn’t feel any discrimination, they treated me the same as how they treated the K-pop bands.”\nThe 25-year-old singer was even surprised to hear the crowd singing along to her original song “Hypnotize.”\n“They welcomed the change in pace. When it was my turn, the mood in the stadium suddenly became very sweet and romantic,” Sabrina shared.\nShe commended organizers for being respectful of her pre-show rituals.\n“They respected my process… they also provided me a guidebook that sort of explains what will happen at the festival. Sobrang efficient and professional nila du’n, like, we were allowed a sound rehearsal and camera rehearsal, mga ganu’n,” she said.\nAt the festival, Sabrina was able to hobnob with K-pop band B1A4. She actually joined them onstage for a performance of the group’s song “Lonely,” which was in Korean.\nSabrina now joins an elite list of performers who have previously represented the Philippines at the Asia Song Festival, including Kitchie Nadal (2006), Barbie Almalbis (2007), Rivermaya (2008), MYMP (2013), and Kyla (2014).\nAsian breakthrough\nTrue to her moniker Asia’s Acoustic Sweetheart, Sabrina has been winning fans across the region.\nShe conquered Malaysia as lone Filipino act to perform at the Kuala Lumpur Lake Garden Festival last August.\nShe has also been wowing fans in Indonesia and Thailand with her successful concert tours.\nNote that series eight of her album under MCA Music has already been certified double platinum in Indonesia and gold in Thailand.\nAlready, there are talks of releasing both a Malaysian and Indonesian versions of the album.\nPlans for the Malaysian version include a possible duet between Sabrina and Malay singer Natasha Sass on “Terima Kasih,” the Malay version of Freddie Aguilar’s “Anak.”\nThe Indonesian version, on the other hand, will include a duet of “Thinking Out Loud” and “Love Me Harder” with the Indonesian artist Chilla Kiana.\nThe immense support she is getting from other Asian countries has given Sabrina newfound confidence. “The fact that our music is known in other countries gives me self-assurance. That’s the one I’m really holding on to,” she said.\nWhile she does have her share of critics, those that scoffed at her for finding success overseas but not making the same mark locally, Sabrina said, “It’s okay. Mas maganda nga ’yung pinaghihirapan, ’pag mas matagal mong nakuha, mas matagal ding mawawala sa ’yo. Nobody’s perfect, hindi talaga ibibigay sa ’yo lahat.”\nShe hopes to dispel the notion that she’s merely a cover act by getting into songwriting. Sabrina is currently writing songs for an all-original album for release next year.\nIn the meantime, Sabrina is also trying to establish a deeper connection with fans here and abroad via social media.\n“Nandu’n na ’yung mga kabataan ngayon. So I’m really tapping on the internet community. I’m always on Twitter and Instagram trying to reach out to the audience and letting them know that I exist,” she said.\nSticking with it\nSabrina started pursuing a career in music at 14 years old. Learning is never really a sure-fire way to success, she said, so she’s learned not to make plans anymore.\n“Parang okay na rin ’yung may surprise factor,” she said.\nIf anything, she sticks to what she holds true and hopes for the best.\n“Music is an expression of yourself. Don’t let anybody change you, telling you how you should fit in. You’re born to stand out,” she said.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:27:18.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
