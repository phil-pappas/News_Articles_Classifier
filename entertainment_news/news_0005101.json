Here they are, ALL SIX @007 's in wax for the first time @MadameTussauds London! What do you think? #BondsJamesBonds pic.twitter.com/0flN34QCZz — Madame Tussauds (@MadameTussauds) October 15, 2015 \nEach of these wax figures are clad in a classic 007 dinner suit, designed by Oscar winning costume designer, Lindy Hemming, based on the original costumes. \nLazenby, Moore and Connery have each been posed in different variations of a classic Bond pose - arms folded and pistol held aloft, whilst Craig, Brosnan and Dalton are shown in more relaxed style. \nThey have been placed in front of an iconic gun barrel backdrop, synonymous with the James Bond films. \nThe Madame Tussauds team already had access to measurements of Craig, Connery, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan from previous figures featured at the attraction, but this is the first time Lazenby has had his own waxwork. \nThe figures took a team of twenty artists, four months to complete at a cost of £150 000 each. Hundreds of layers of oil paint were used to build up accurate skin tones and each hair on all of the figures' heads was inserted individually by hand over a six week period. \nThe figures will embark on a tour of Madame Tussauds locations worldwide on 1 December. \n(Photo: Greatstock/Splash) Read more on: james bond | movies NEXT ON CHANNEL24 X", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:44:45.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
