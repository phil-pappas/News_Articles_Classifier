Whoever has nicked @WarwickADavis caravan you will be hunted down! Big mistake... https://t.co/MN8JmDkxIC \n‚Äî Stephen Mulhern (@StephenMulhern) October 10, 2015 \nDavis continued to provide updates as people enquired about the suspected theft. It was spotted heading east of Yaxley, Peterborough towed by blue pickup, sparks flying from a dragging wheel lock. https://t.co/vIUTuHnbRB \n‚Äî Warwick Davis (@WarwickADavis) October 11, 2015 \nAnd while some people made plenty of jokes, Davis maintained his humour. @WarwickADavis I'm selling this if you're interested? pic.twitter.com/5nIWF0DCLW \n‚Äî Wayne Webster (@WayneWebbo) October 11, 2015 Not funny... but they didn't steal my sense of humour so I'll give you that one.

Hope you get it back asap \n‚Äî Tina Hanson (@Tiny_T_tweets) October 11, 2015 @WarwickADavis Hope you get your caravan back! Potterheads will be looking out for it and we maybe, just maybe turn the robber into a ferret \nDavis played Professor Filius Flitwick in the 'Potter' films as well as voicing Griphook in the first film. Close 'Harry Potter': Where Are They Now? of ÓÄÄ ÓÄÅ Since appearing as the movies' title character, Daniel has managed to shake off Harry and ensure he's known by his own name - which has been aided by the fact he'll happily get his kit off on-screen and on-stage. After stints in the West End and on Broadway, Daniel recently starred in 'What If', and in 2015, fans will see him take on the role of Igor in 'Frankenstein'. Since hanging up his wizard's hat, Rupert has made waves on the West End stage, and in 2013 he received rave reviews for his performance in 'Mojo'. He also stowed some his 'Harry Potter' cash away and splashed it on an ice cream truck, fulfilling a childhood dream. Aww! You'll find Ralph in 'Wrath of the Titans', 'Skyfall' and 'Great Expectations'. It has also been announced he's been cast in the upcoming, as-yet-unnamed, James Bond film. Sadly, Jamie hasn't faired too well in recent years and in 2012 he was imprisoned after participating in the 2011 London riots. Sadly, Joshua hasn't faired too well either, and has dropped off the radar as far as acting is concerned. After being everyone's favourite bad guy in the films, Tom decided to try something a little different and recorded a number of singles, which he shared with fans via YouTube. He's currently filming 'Clavius', where he stars as a character called Lucius. Tom's also really, really good at Twitter. After getting surprisingly dishy, Matthew now spends his time reminding everyone that he's also hugely talented, making his West End debut in 2012 alongside Arthur Darvill and Laurence Fox in 'Our Boys'. Matthew also took part in one of the best editions of Innuendo Bingo ever on Scott Mills' Radio 1 show. Bonnie was one of the 'Harry Potter' frachise's younger stars, however, that hasn't stopped her from going on to carve a successful career. While she hasn't quite achieved the worldwide success of the films' leading stars, Bonnie has been applauded for her work as a model and actress. She also writes and directs her own screen plays. To be honest, Rob's had a rather quiet life since his character's exit left us weeping in the 'Goblet Of Fire' film. After a lot of digging, Robert's main achievement seems to be another franchise entitled 'Twilight'. Nope, we've never heard of it either... Julie is one of the many huge names who appeared in the 'Harry Potter' films so it's not like her career needed the boost. Since the final film in 2011, Julie's been praised by critics her roles in a whole host of other movies, including voicing the witch in Disney's 'Brave'. Michael is rumoured to be reprising his role in the upcoming wizrding flick 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. He also plays Howard Mollison in the TV adaptation of JK's novel 'A Casual Vacancy'. Already a legend, Dame Maggie Smith continues to win fans with her performance as the Dowager Countess in hit TV series 'Downton Abbey'. She's also no stranger to the big screen, and starred in 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' and is set to feature in the upcoming sequel. Amongst other projects, John has completed three where he was cast alongside other 'Harry Potter' stars; 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', 'The Gruffalo's Child' and 'Labyrinth'. Since 'Harry Potter', method actor Alan has been part of several projects including 'CBGB', alongside his former co-star Rupert Grint. After providing the voice of everybody's favourite House Elf, Toby's projects included 'The Hunger Games', 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and 'The Adventures of Tintin'. Once filming wrapped, Robbie moved over to the Dark Side and joined Voldemort's gang. By which we mean, starred alongside Ralph Fiennes, in 'Great Expectations'. Traitor. Oh Kenneth, where do we start? Ever since *that* version of 'Hamlet', Brannagh has been one of our favourite stars to swoon over. Since leaving the Wizarding World, Kenneth has turned his attention to directing, as well as starring in flicks such as 'My Week With Marilyn' and 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit'. In between stints studying for a degree at Brown University in the US, Emma starred in a number of blockbusters including 'The Bling Ring' and 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'. Shortly after graduating in 2013, it was announced that Emma has accepted a UN post and will serve as a Women's Goodwill Ambassador. Gary's a very busy man and has totted up an extensive list of appearances since his Harry Potter days. These include: 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Dark Knight Rises' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'. He also voiced Viktor Reznov and Daniel Clarke in the 'Call of Duty' games. David also lent his voice to video games, specifically as the voice of Lord Darius Crowley in 'World of Warcraft: Cataclysm in 2010'. Other projects include 'War Horse' and a role in 'Separate We Come, Separate We Go', a short film directed by Bonnie Wright, who played Ginny Weasley. Do we really need to tell you what John Cleese has been up to? Seriously? Mad-eye Moody is actually quite sharp, bagging himself parts in numerous projects including 2014's 'Edge of Tomorrow'. He's also set to star in 'Suffragette', alongside Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham-Carter. Geraldine's fleeting appearances as Harry's mum gave the movies some of their most poignant moments. Since then, she's appeared in 'My Week With Marilyn' and 'Grace Of Monaco'. Natalia evidently knows how to smell out a hit as she's also starred in 'Game of Thrones' as Osha. David's done barely anything since his time as Barty Crouch Jr. No time as a famous Timelord, no treading the boards in Shakespeare plays and he definitely didn't star opposite Olivia Colman in an award-winning ITV drama series. Lazy moo. A bit of a cult hit on YouTube, Warwick Davies has been feautured on several channels, most notably the YogsCast. In the land of television he's made guest appearances on shows including 'An Idiot Abroad', 'Top Gear'. He also played Oberon the Ufgood in 'Dwarves Assemble'. More recently he played Old Hamm in 'Jack the Giant Slayer' and can (sometimes) be found teaching charms lessons at the Warner Bros. Studios VIP nights. Like Ralph Fiennes, Helen also appeared in 'Skyfall'. she also stars in the hit drama 'Peaky Blinders' as Aunt Polly. What can we say? The inimitable Helena Bonham Carter played the role of Bellatrix to disturbing perfection and played similarly creepy parts in many other movies. To be honest, if Voldy had left her in charge, he probably would have triumphed. Helena was the perfect Madame Thernardier in 'Les Miserables' and also gave a stellar performance as Elizabeth Taylor in a BBC television film. Shirley Henderson appeared in just a couple of the movies as the ghoul skulking around the toilets. Since then, she voiced the Gruffalo's child in the film of the same name and also starred in 'Soutchliffe', 'Filth' and 'Death In Paradise'. Since 'Harry Potter' Staunton has voiced Queen Victoria in 'The Pirates! Band of Misfits' and played Knotgrass in 'Maleficent'.
