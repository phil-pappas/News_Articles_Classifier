VW chief Martin Winterkorn resigned after the scandal broke in the U.S., saying he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part.\nEwing's still-untitled book will explore the \"more, better, faster\" ethos and how it played into the scandal.\nDiCaprio, an active environmentalist, would serve as a producer on the project.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
