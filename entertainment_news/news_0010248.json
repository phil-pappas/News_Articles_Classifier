The chart-topping singer was arrested back in January at the Cromwell Hotel after getting involved in a brawl. He reportedly hit a cop who took him into an elevator. The R&B singer will avoid jail time in the plea deal. He is ordered to pay $1,000 to a police foundation, take anger management classes, and do 50 hours worth of community service. His case will be dismissed if he remains out of trouble while completing the court orders. The Weeknd made no mention of the incident on his social media. The \"Can't Feel My Face\" singer simply posted a cryptic message of \"escaped from Las Vegas\" after his arrest back then. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:57:31.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
