It's San Francisco radio station KFOG-FM 104.5's all-star charity single aimed at raising awareness about breast cancer and raising funds to eradicate the disease. \nThink \"We Are the World\" or \"Do They Know It's Christmas,\" only on a slightly smaller scale and without such rock-royalty songwriting credits as Bob Geldof and Michael Jackson behind it. In fact, the lyrics to \"Boob Spelled Backwards is Boob\" were penned by an 8-year-old boy, Archer Nelson, the son of KFOG DJ Mike \"No Name\" Nelson, as a way of coping with his mother having breast cancer. KFOG radio personality Mike \"No Name\" Nelson is seen on day 7 in Cleveland, Ohio, during his trip across the US to bring awareness to the fight against breast cancer. Nelson did a 3,000 mile ride on a pink Harley, wearing a sparkling pink helmet and a pink cape across the country, visiting breast cancer treatment centers. Also, Nelson's son Archer, at the age of 8, wrote a song called \"Boob Spelled Backwards is Boob\" that was recorded by an all-star cast of performers to promote breast cancer awareness.

But he does realize his song is \"helping people.\" \nThe tune has become the rallying cry for the Boob Project, a multifaceted endeavor that aims to raise $100,000 or more for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. One of the fundraising efforts takes place Friday with a concert headlined by Tracy's Megan Slankard -- a key contributor to \"Boob Spelled Backwards Is Boob\" -- at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. \nThe song's origins date back several months, when Mike Nelson opened his CD player tray to find a wad of paper had been slipped inside. It bore the words \"Boob Spelled Backwards Is Boob\" scribbled in Archer's handwriting.

McQuaid was touched by the story and came up with a plan to turn Archer's idea into a real song to benefit the fight against breast cancer. The first step was for Nelson to ask his son to write a full set of lyrics -- and the boy absolutely rose to the challenge.

Oda/ Bay Area News Grou ) \nThe theme is all about appreciating what you have, even in hard times: \"Never forget the good things in life/like candy, life, eating, having fun/because in the end all that matters, all that matters is you.\" The chorus, of course, closes with the adorable palindrome lesson that is the song's title. \nThe next challenge was finding A-listers to record the song. The first break came later in January when Bay Area singer-songwriter and activist Michael Franti agreed to lay down a guitar part. Then Spandau Ballet's Tony Hadley signed on to sing a few lines, followed by Florence Welch, rocker Noel Gallagher (of Oasis), Hozier and many others. Basically, any time that a musical guest stopped in the KFOG studio -- for an interview or what have you -- he or she was asked to chip in. \n\"Not everyone we asked did it -- and that's fine,\" McQuaid says. \"But we are thrilled with those who did.\" \nThe feeling appears to be mutual. Bay Area singer-songwriter Matt Nathanson, for example, tweeted: \"I was honored to be asked to be a part of this. @KFOGRadio doing GREAT work for a great cause!\" \nThe song was released Oct. 1, the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. A corresponding video features the stars during the recording sessions, as well as artists holding up signs with the hashtag #boobproject. The music video starts off with a message from the song's lyricist: \n\"Hello, my name is Archer, and I'm here to tell you that one in eight women have breast cancer in the world. Unfortunately, my mom was one of them.\" \nCorresponding with the release of the song, Mike Nelson embarked on a 3,000-mile, cross-country trek aboard a pink Harley Davidson, wearing a pink helmet and other matching motorcycle gear. He started out in San Francisco on Oct. 1 and ended in New York nine days later. \n\"Obviously, the bike gets a lot of attention,\" Nelson said during a stop in Pennsylvania. \"People are honking constantly, which is a little sketchy when you are on the freeway.\" \nNelson stopped at several breast cancer treatment centers along the ride, collecting signatures on his pink Harley from women who have battled breast cancer. \n\"There's got to be close to 2,000 names on (the bike),\" says Nelson, who lives in Oakland with wife, Christi, and sons Archer and Eddie. \"Every name on that bike is someone like my wife.\" KFOG radio personality Mike \"No Name\" Nelson invites people he meets to write and sign his pink motorcycle during his trip across the United States to bring awareness to the fight against breast cancer.

Nelson believes early detection might have been a key factor in the case of his wife, who was diagnosed with Stage 2B breast cancer after getting her first mammogram at the age of 40. She is currently tumor-free and continuing to get treatment. \n\"If she had waited a year or two, \" Nelson says, \"she might not be here right now.\" Follow Jim Harrington at twitter.com/jimthecritic .
