(He was watching Super 8 on the tour bus when he got the initial inspiration). \n“It was very difficult but you know it was also very invigorating. Once I actually felt creative energy again, then it was almost like a high.” \nWe caught up with Ramsay and bassist Mike Ayley in Toronto recently to talk Astoria, described as a concept album about “that emotional journey that Josh went through,” writers block, and touring. \nWas there a precise moment when you felt you could write again? \nJosh: I kind of had like a nervous breakdown for a while, and it was just six months of feeling awful, and then I was sitting in the hospital, feeling really dark, I was just kind of there solo, and I kind of had this moment of clarity where I was like, ‘I can’t make my mom better, there’s nothing I can do about that, I had to sort of accept that. I can’t control that relationship with my ex-fiance, I can’t just fix that either. The one thing that is in my power ... is getting back to writing.’ ... And then I came out of the hospital and went straight to the studio. \nHow did the rest of the band handle Josh's crisis? \nMike: You sort of have to let a person in general, whatever their life is, go through the process themselves. \nJosh: The guys in the band were great about it all. .... The funny thing is I’m not really even embarrassed about it because f--- sometimes s--- happens. \nYou’re touring the U.S. in November, with a couple of Quebec dates at the end, but what can the rest of Canada expect in the way of an arena tour and production (believed to be next spring)? \nJosh: More projectors and stuff and creating sets that change. The guy who helps us design the show is also one of the head designers for Cirque Du Soleil so he’s really good ... But I think we want to create one of our own ‘80s adventure movies. \nCan I ask how your mom is doing? \nJosh: She’s still fighting, but dementia just gets worse and worse. But she’s still with us for now. And she did manage to sing on (Astoria). The little ending of the album (End of an Era) is my family singing, ‘cause they’re all singers ... That really meant a lot to me that she’s on there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:58:31.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
