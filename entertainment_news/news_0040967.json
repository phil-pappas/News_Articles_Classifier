Margaret is ‘PsyCHO’ for San Francisco 1  /  1 Back to Gallery San Francisco native Margaret Cho is known for her humor, of course, but also for her activism and her no-BS personality. That’s just one of the reasons why we love her and why hometown audiences will want to turn out for the San Francisco stop of her “Margaret Cho: PsyCHO” tour today, Oct. 15, at the Castro Theatre .\nShe’s been in the news recently for her revelation that she was repeatedly molested by a family friend from ages 5 to 12 and that she was raped throughout her teenage years as well.\nShe titled her current tour “The PsyCHO Tour” to reflect the anger she feels toward so much going haywire in the world right now. The tour was taped for an HBO special not too long ago, but there’s nothing like seeing her live, and there’s no better place in the world for that than the Castro.\n— David Wiegand \nMargaret Cho: “The PsyCHO Tour.” 8 and 10:15 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 15.
