Lance Bass is good friends with the Kardashian crew and he happily opened up about how the family is doing since Lamar Odom was hospitalized earlier this month.\n“They’re doing good,” the ex-NSYNC member told reporters at the Environmental Media Awards in L.A., Us Weekly reports . “I was just over at Kris’ house the other day and – I mean they put their lives on hold. I give it up for those girls. Love them or hate them, they really stepped up to the plate and saved his life.”\nBass, 36, called the situation “devastating,” but said Odom is improving daily and the family “has high hopes.”\nThe Kardashian family sprang into action when Odom was rushed to hospital on October 13 after collapsing at the Love Ranch brothel in Nevada.\nEstranged wife, Khloe along with her mother Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian rushed to his bedside. In the next couple of days Kourtney Kardashian along with younger sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner visited the Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas.\nOdom has since been transported to Cedars- Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles where he is receiving round the clock treatment.\nLester Cohen/(Credit too long, see caption) Lance Bass at the Environmental Media Association Awards in Los Angeles.

Enlarge Bass also commented on Khloe’s decision to withdraw their divorce papers.\n“I mean, I’m not surprised,” he confessed. “I think when anybody goes through some tragedy like that it’s going to bring you closer. You could always tell that she was so madly in love with him this whole time, but he had this problem, just like Khloe saw an intervention.\nBass is hopeful that Odom’s near death experience will serve as a wake-up call for the ex-NBA star to quit drugs.\n“Hopefully, this is the last straw that is going to stop everything,\" he said. \"Then, if he makes it and he comes out of this, he's going to change a lot of lives out there and save a lot of lives. I have a feeling he's going to really stay clean and really spread the message of living a sober life.\"\nRelated Stories Lance Bass: Kardashian family is ‘devastated’ by Odom crisis Lance Bass: I was touched ‘inappropriately’ by a ‘pedophile' Kris Jenner still feels 'guilty' about Nicole Brown Simpson", "external_links": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lance-bass-on-the-kardashians-lamar-odom-they-saved-his-life-20152610"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:55:19.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
