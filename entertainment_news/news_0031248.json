Tom Hanks in a scene from \"Bridge of Spies.\" (Picture: Jaap Buitendijk/DreamWorks Pictures/Fox 2000 PIctures via AP) Source: AP \nWATCHING Bridge of Spies is a little like watching two and a half hours of a really good poker game. \nOK, that might not actually be everyone’s cup of tea, but if I may clarify. \nThis Cold War-era thriller is a hybrid procedural drama and espionage intrigue flick, with a complex game of bluff and counter-bluff churning away in its core. \nBased on real events, Bridge of Spies , with its script by the Coen brothers and flawless direction by Steven Spielberg, is a cunningly plotted story with a tension and excitement that make its hefty running time fly by. \nTom Hanks stars as James Donovan, an American insurance lawyer who is drafted in by the US Government in 1957 for the unusual assignment of defending a captured Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). \nThe trial is a sham affair with a foregone conclusion, of course, but the US needs to uphold the charade that the accused is getting fair representation. \nEnd of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar. \nWhat the CIA hasn’t bargained on is Donovan’s strong ethical standing, and he actually foots a strong defence for Abel, even becoming friends with the man. \nMeanwhile, the Russians capture an American operative on their soil, so Donovan is again recruited by the US, this time to negotiate the delicate matter of a prisoner exchange. \nMost of the events shown in the film take place in Berlin at the time of the Berlin Wall being constructed, and the depiction of a city split in half by two warring ideologies is a powerful one. \nAs is so often the case with Spielberg’s films, there is a personal element to the story, with Spielberg’s father having travelled to East Berlin around the time of the events portrayed, so the human side of this deeply political event is explored in vivid detail. \nWe see the wall going up, workers grimly piling the bricks up as citizens hurry to cross the border before it is sealed off. \nWe see the fate of those trying to make a run for the border, the squalor of the Eastern sector, and the bitterness of the East Germans who have been left to occupy the bombed-out eastern half of Berlin, so badly ruined during World War II by their now-allies, the USSR. \nAs Donovan crosses that border into the Soviet side of Berlin, all sense of order and normality drops away abruptly. Not only are the battle-scarred streets nearly devoid of cars and awash with street gangs, even Donovan’s mission becomes murky and obscure. \nHe is given only the vaguest briefing by the CIA, and as the audience follows his activities in enemy territory, we are left with no more of an idea than he has. \nHis first meeting with his designated contact is a bizarre and jumbled affair that makes little sense at fist glance, and it only gets more complicated when the Russians and East Germans start running their own agendas. \nFor a long time, you will probably struggle to keep it all straight, but that’s OK, Donovan has no idea either, just let it happen. \nAdding to the engaging sense of disorientation, none of the German or Russian dialogue is subtitled. So unless you happen to speak either of these languages, you are left as confused and alienated as Donovan, which is a very effective device. \nHanks, as you might expect, is excellent as Donovan. Even though the character is defined more in terms of his moral compass than his personality, he nonetheless comes across as a very believable and likable protagonist, one whose ethical convictions we can readily latch on to. \nRylance is probably the more exciting performance on screen, with his portrayal of accused spy Abel. He is inscrutable, but there is just enough unguarded humanity showing through the cracks of his carefully constructed persona to make him sympathetic, rather than a villain. \nThe interplay between Donovan and the various officials and agents he meets carries all manner of fascinating discussions about patriotism, treatment of prisoners, miscarriage of justice, and the insanity of the Mutually Assured Destruction level of international relations of the time. \nAnd watching the way Donovan negotiates the mazelike deal he is brokering is quite inspiring. This film makes diplomacy and negotiation look thrilling. \nHow much of the story has been tweaked and changed for the sake of drama I could not say, but the story that stands is beautifully written and supported by solid acting performances and authentic location filming. \nBridge of Spies will require your full attention and it doesn’t spell much out for you, so make sure you keep your wits about you. And the result is gripping and satisfying. \nBridge of Spies is now showing at Village Cinemas, the State Cinema and Cmax, rated M. \nRATING: four stars (out of five)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:13:29.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
