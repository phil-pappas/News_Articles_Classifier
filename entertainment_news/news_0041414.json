Peacock swings a pendulum across the spectrum of what's considered to be today's country music - bridging gaps between modern country, outlaw country, folk, Americana, and even classic rock. Sarah has been on the road now for 10 years and has performed over 250 dates a year since 2009. She’s had the privilege of carrying her music across the world and has met many wonderful people with incredible stories. Sarah has crafted these experiences into a group of empowering new songs for her third studio album. She is now working with The All Good Factory, an artist management company who also also co-manages Ben Folds. Not only is Sarah Peacock making an album full of songs that empower others to soar, her team has over 60 years of music industry experience that will help make this project fly in the market as well. She will be recording her album on music row in Nashville at the world famous RCA studio A, Grand Victor Sound. Right now there is an opening in country music for strong women with powerful messages, and Peacock has lots of encouragement from her listeners and her team that this space is where she fits. Sarah and her team believe that these songs and their mission of Love can fill part of that void.\nSarah will begin recording in January 2016. Between now and the end of 2015 they will be focused on pre-production, setting up the equation for an incredible record! And that equation starts with Kickstarter. Before everyone can listen to this new, powerful album, Sarah needs help. That’s why she launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $35,000 by November 6, 2015. The funds raised will go towards recording and manufacturing the new album.\nTo help bring this authentic and honest new album to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by March 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So, know that any amount pledged can make a difference. Sarah and her team believe that we all have a gift and a dream we can use to be agents of change in this world. That is their goal for this album. What an incredible opportunity to be a part of this special campaign! Help Sarah Peacock reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Sarah Peacock\nTitle: Artist\nPhone: 615-305-1240\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
