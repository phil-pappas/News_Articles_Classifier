And something about me: Ive loved science fiction since being turned on to Ray Bradburys short stories when I was 10; a year or so later, I was a founding member of The Rocket Club, formed with the pals I grew up with, regularly writing to NASA and getting, in return, maps of the moon and detailed information on Project Mercury. A summer job between freshman and sophomore years at college had me working in a photo lab, taking shots of astronauts and equipment involved with Apollo 11. Oddly, being a space nut and a TV and movie nut, I was never a fan of either Star Trek or Star Wars. I just didnt get them. A top-of-my-head list of my favorites are: Alien, Blade Runner, Terminator 2, Sleeper, Avatar, The War of the Worlds, The Fifth Element, Galaxy Quest, AI: Artificial Intelligence and The Fly. Though those are in no particular order, youll note that the first two were directed by Ridley Scott, one of them set in deep space, the other on Earth. Scotts The Martian will need another viewing by me before deciding if it gets a spot on my sci-fi top 10 list, but its intelligence and humor and intrigue and believability make it one of the most enjoyable times Ive had in a moviehouse this year. Id like to be able say theres no need to review it  just go see it. But here are a few thoughts about what made it so special for me. Matt Damon, in a mostly solo performance, plays Mark Watney, a botanist on a team of astronauts who are nearing the end of a lengthy mission to Mars, where theyve conducted experiments and spent time in a compound of living and research buildings. Things go wrong, Watney is killed in an accident, and circumstances force the rest of the crew to head home without his body. Nope, he wasnt killed, but no one could have known that. NASA officials back home realize whats happened, though the crew speeding back home arent informed. The film eventually turns into studies of him trying to survive his hostile surroundings, even as he watches his food and water supplies dwindle, and of the space agency trying to figure out a way to get more of those supplies to him or to rescue him. This is a serious story, with serious themes, but the script, based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, infuses the film with a sense of hope and in a few instances a laugh-out-loud sense of humor. Damon, all alone, but able to shed his helmet and space suit when hes in the compound, records a chronicle of his time there on video, and to stay sane keeps himself company by talking ... a lot ... and its much of that chatter thats funny. The film also takes plenty of opportunities to lob hilarious pot shots at the entire genre of disco music, so get ready to hear, to the chagrin of Damons disco-disliking character, Turn the Beat Around, Hot Stuff, and Rock the Boat. Relax, David Bowies art-rocker Starman gets played in its apt entirety. Page 2 of 2 - Something else to note: Unlike the mostly solo performance by Sandra Bullock in Gravity, this has lots of other people in different places, ranging from NASA in Houston to the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena to that spaceship with the crew hurtling toward Earth from Mars. The lions share of the films time is spent with Damon, but it all stays fresh by jumping between locations. In and around the humor and the tense moments and circumstances, its all wrapped up in a celebration of scientific ingenuity and a bit of dumb luck. One more note: Sci-fi fans who are also foodies might want to check into the idea of natural organic Martian-grown potatoes.
