Directed by Sheryl Kaller. Oct. 16-Nov. 15 at the Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, 527 Tremont St., Boston. $25 and up; 617-266-0800, or huntingtontheatre.org. Playwright Winnie Holzman, who penned the musical juggernaut “Wicked,” trades Oz for journalism in her latest endeavor, “Choice.” The thought-provoking comedy, her first full-length play, will be performed by the Huntington Theatre Company and opens Friday at the Boston Center for the Arts. In it, Holzman, 61, tells the story of a successful journalist, Zipporah Zunder, who writes a story that changes her life. “The subjects explored in the play come from things I think about and which are important to me – like friendships, and reaching a point in life where we question whether or not we can still surprise ourselves. It’s a comedy that looks at a woman’s right to choose, but in a decidedly unexpected way. It’s intimate and emotional and it can make you laugh and make you think at the same time. As I was writing, I started to realize that I had pretty strong feelings about the way the subject of choice, as it relates to ending a pregnancy, is discussed in our culture, the brutality of some of those ways, and how that can kind of force you to pick a side.” Thought-provoking material and indelible female characters and their relationships are Holzman’s stock-in-trade. Prior to adapting Gregory Maguire’s book to bring Elphaba and Glinda to the stage, she earned an Emmy nomination as creator of “My So-Called Life,” a short-lived 90s TV series that became a cult hit with its spot-on depiction of adolescent angst, and put its stars, a teenage Clare Danes and future Oscar-winner Jared Leto, on the map. Other TV writing credits include episodes of “The Wonder Years” and “thirtysomething.” More recently, the Princeton graduate who also earned a master’s degree in fine arts from the New York University Musical Theater Program collaborated with her daughter, Savannah Dooley, to develop the 2010 ABC Family series, “Huge,” based on the young-adult novel of the same name by Sasha Paley. Holzman also co-wrote the play “Assisted Living” with her husband, actor Paul Dooley. The pair, married since 1984, co-starred in a 2014 production of the play at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J. Holzman, who also appeared in small parts on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and the film “Jerry Magurie,” said writing has a different appeal than acting. “I feel like both have many wonderful things about them, and some not-so-wonderful things, too,” Holzman said. For “Wicked” she said working with legendary composer Stephen Schwartz and Maguire, the author, were perks, but “Choice” was different. “With ‘Choice’ there was nothing to jump off from. It took a long time to write and went through many changes and multiple drafts. The whole process scared me, but that was fine because I went into it knowing I wanted to be challenged.” Page 2 of 2 - And once “Choice” is up and running, would Holzman, who has been signed to write the screenplay for the much-anticipated feature-film version of “Wicked,” choose to tackle another musical? “If the idea appealed to me enough, I would definitely do another musical. Not too many people know this, but when I was young I wrote lyrics as well. So next time, I’d like to write not only the book, but also the lyrics.” “Wicked” has been going strong on Broadway for more than a decade. While Holzman said she’s proud of that success, she never wanted to coast on that show’s achievements. “Having a big success like ‘Wicked’ made me feel very blessed and grateful. I didn’t have to worry about the next TV job,” she said. “But I also felt a sense of responsibility to do something significant.” And so, “Choice” was born. By R.
