A play on the heartwrenching story of Aruna Shanbaug, which was recently staged in the capital, moved many to tears.\nAdapted from Pinki Virani's book Aruna's Story and directed by Arvind Gaur, the play saw theatre artiste Lushin Dubey sustaining a 75-minute solo act.\nAruna, a junior nurse at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, was sexually assaulted by a ward boy , Sohanlal, in 1973. The attack put her in a vegetative state for the rest of her life. The play began with Sohanlal waiting for Aruna at the hospital basement and went on to show how he choked her with a chain during the assault, which left her brain-dead, cortically blind, and unable to speak or walk. The nurses in Mumbai went on strike demanding improved conditions for Shanbaug and better working conditions for themselves, and even thwarted the municipal corporations' attempts to move Shanbaug out of the hospital to free the bed she was occupying.\nBROKEN DREAMS\nThe play went beyond the incident and told the story of how a simple village girl, fuelled by her passions, defied her parents' wish to get her married and went to Mumbai to pursue her dreams. It showed Aruna telling her mother about her dream to get a scholarship and travel around the world.\nMURDERER BUT NOT A RAPIST?\nSohanlal was sentenced to jail on charges of robbery and attempt to murder, and the sexual assault and rape were not even mentioned because no one was willing to be a complainant. Aruna's case resulted in a landmark judgement allowing for passive euthanasia and today , if a woman is raped and left in a semi-vegetative state, the rapist is tried as a murderer. The play also asked the question - why should there be another Aruna or Nirbhaya? \" Yeh chuppi kyun ? Natak yahan khatam nahi hota. Natak yahan se shuru hota hai ,\" Arvind said, putting the onus on society for creating a safer environment for women.\n\"While it took a lot of research to write this play, it took us only 14 days to prepare it. I like a director who doesn't impede me in executing my own interpretations,\" said Lushin.\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Theatre news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Theatre news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Theatre updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:24:21.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
