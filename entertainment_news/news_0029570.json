During the festivities, Fallon tripped and fell, leading to a trip to Massachusetts General Hospital. \nA source assures People magazine that \"everything is totally fine,\" explaining, \"It was all part of the celebration in the street and some random girl kneeled down in front of him abruptly as he was turning around and he tripped over her because he didn't see her.\" \n\"Jimmy went to the ground, and everybody asked if he was OK,\" an eyewitness tells the magazine. \"He said he was fine.\" \nCambridge police reportedly helped Fallon back up, and he took off in his limo and headed straight for the hospital. \n\"Nothing that a few band aids couldn't fix,\" Fallon, 41, later wrote on Instagram , alongside a photo of his right hand, which had two bandages on it. \nOct 25, 2015 at 11:24am PDT \nHowever, another picture posted by a party-goer -- apparently since taken down -- showed the comedian's hand heavily bandaged. \nOne fan managed to catch Fallon’s flop on video and posted it on Instagram. \nOct 24, 2015 at 6:52pm PDT \nFallon nearly severed his finger in a fall at his home this summer. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
