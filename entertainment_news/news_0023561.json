It’s all they want, is to live their lives, and you see that humanity. I think that’s a big part of the show, seeing past the exterior. It gets me every time. I really love that.”\nMore Information On stage\nWhat: Touring production of “Beauty and the Beast”\nWhen: 8 p.m. today, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Sunday,\nWhere: Majestic Theatre, 224 E. Houston St.\nTickets: $35-$95 box office, 210-226-5700; additional fees applied to tickets purchased at ticketmaster.com.\nThe show is a stage adaptation of the Oscar-winning 1991 Disney movie about the unlikely romance that develops between brave young bookworm Belle and the Beast, who lives in an enchanted castle.\nBoth Quintana and Sam Hartley , who plays the Beast, remember first connecting with their characters as children.\nBelle was Quintana’s favorite Disney princess growing up. And she still has a photo of herself as a 4-year-old wearing a Belle costume that her mother made for her.\n“I think I always loved Belle because she is the hero in the story,” she said. “She’s not a damsel in distress. She is a strong, intelligent woman and a role model.”\nHartley was about that same age when he first saw the movie, and said he remembers a VHS copy of it being “well-beloved in my household.\n“As strange as this is, there’s a song that’s called ‘Something There,’ and I remember getting emotional about it at a young age, I don’t know if I understood why that was, but I can picture it: I’m sitting in day care on a couch and being struck by it. And one of the rewarding parts of doing the show now is, I’m 27 and I’m getting to approach the show from an adult perspective.”\ndlmartin@express-news.net\nTwitter: @DeborahMartinEN", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/71/8793671/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/71/8793671/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:01:57.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
