The fourth installment of \"Toy Story\" movie series is now scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on June 15, 2018. Now that \"Toy Story 4\" has just got a new release date, \" Cars 3 \" is taking over the original release date of the toy-centric movie. \"Cars 3\" is now slated to be released Stateside on June 16, 2017. \"Toy Story 4\" is said to feature a love story in which Woody reunites with Bo-Peep. John Lasseter directs the movie with Rashida Jones writing the screenplay. Another Disney/Pixar film, \" The Incredibles 2 \", has also got a release date. The movie about a family, which members possess superpower abilities, will arrive in North America on June 21, 2019. Brad Bird is attached to direct the movie. Plot details about the movie are kept under wraps, but Samuel L. Jackson previously hinted that his character Frozone would be back. \"Every time I run into Brad he always tells me Frozone is part of what's going on [in the sequel], so I have to believe that,\" he said. Bird recently revealed one significant difference between the first and the second \"Incredibles\" films. He said that the upcoming film would not \"have the family discovering, or rather, the kids discovering their powers.\" \"[T]he powers themselves are not that interesting, it's the people that are interesting and how they react to having those powers,\" he added. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Toy Story 4 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:33:55.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
