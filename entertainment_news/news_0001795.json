When she did, she thought it tasted amazing. And from that moment of inspiration, Gonzales — with partners Melinda Joseph and Ozzie Meza — founded Mac & Cheese Fest , yet another of the all-in-on-one-dish food festivals so prevalent in Chicago these past few years (See: Ramenfest , Baconfest ).\nIts second iteration took place this past Saturday, and organizers said some 4,000 attendees walked through the doors of the UIC Forum for gooey helpings of pasta. This year, 86 restaurants took part during the festival’s lunch and dinner sessions, with names from Carnivale and Dinosaur Bar-B-Que to Charlatan and Real Urban BBQ.\nThere were two grand prize winners this year, chosen from a panel of food professionals and public vote. The lunch session winner of the “Golden Noodle” went to AMK Kitchen Bar’s version with jalapeno, a bacon crust and five cheeses (asiago, provolone, gouda, fontina, havarti). The chef of the Logan Square restaurant, Barney Smith, was formerly a sous chef at Sunda.\nThe night session winner was a cupcake and cookies food truck based in Roselle called Auntie Vee’s. Chef Navena Moore’s winning creation was a mac & cheese bread pudding, which she calls a Pu'deesie.\nMore winners from the event:\n(Lunch session)\n1st Runner Up: Kitty O'Sheas\n2nd Runner Up: Real Urban BBQ\nMost Creative: Carnivale\nBest Presentation: Knife & Tine\n(Dinner session)\n1st Runner Up: Amazing Edibles Catering\n2nd Runner Up: Red Door\nMost Creative: State and Lake Chicago Tavern\nBest Presentation: Real Urban BBQ\nkpang@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pang\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.auntievees.com/", "http://www.ramenfestchicago.com/", "http://baconfestchicago.com/", "http://twitter.com/pang", "http://www.macandcheesechicago.com/", "http://amkchicago.com/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e407c/turbine/ct-mac-cheese-fest-crowns-two-winners-at-uic-forum-20151026"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:31:33.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
