It signals the start of the annual three-night Ghostwalk by the New Bern Historical Society. This year’s theme —“Un-Modern Family”— celebrates the 25th annual production, featuring all local actors creating characters from the past. The Cedar Grove Cemetery follows through with the “Un-Modern family” theme, according to cemetery coordinator and actor Bill Hand. The first night schedule begins at 6:30 p.m., and at 5:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, when all the sites are open. Agony Alley at the Attmore-Oliver House, 511 Broad St., features the “VeriGood Bakery: Sliced Bread” all three nights. Brad and Holly Geres return as the ghostly welcoming undertakers at Cedar Grove, with an entrance through the Weeping Arch on Queen Street. Robert Hay, a beloved carriage maker who died in 1850, will visit with his young wife, Nancy. Hay was a much-loved devout Presbyterian and immigrant who was a co-founder of First Presbyterian; he fathered his last child at the age of 80. They are portrayed by Per Erichsen and Cinda Hill. Robert “Strawberry” Conderman, the popular son of a New Bern postman, is another ghost. He was a Marine flier who was the lead pilot of several Hellcats on Wake Island. Only hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese also launched a surprise attack Wake Island. Conderman was cut down as he was running for his airplane to try to fight the enemy, making him New Bern’s first casualty of that war. He is portrayed by Van Page. His father, Fred Conderman, a well-known sports enthusiast and crack shot, later joined the military as a postman and found himself at Guam when it was being recaptured by the Americans. After he finished his postal work each day, he took a rifle and went hunting Japanese. Fred may well be seen skulking about the graveyard seeking his foes. Brownie Hanks, a socialite of the turn of the century, will show up as well. Miss Hanks became one of the first female bank tellers in the state. Cassidy Giroir will play a young woman of 1943 recalling the German POWs who were kept at Camp Battle — now Glenburnie Park. The POWs were employed by several local farms and on a number of family farms. The Masonic Theatre, home of the RiverTowne Players, will have presentations from “Pinocchio, Wayard Son” at 514 Hancock St. New Bern Civic Theatre presents “Evita, Don’t Cry for Me” at 414 Pollock St. As for the theme this year, the historical society noted that “everyone has ‘that’ member of the family; the one that the family stories are about.” Page 2 of 2 - On Friday and Saturday, the other sites open. Enter the Thomas McGinn House in 1966 and meet society writer Sue Flowers and an anxious bride and her mother. Then go back to the 1830s at Tryon Palace’s Dixon House to learn all about that family from Antoinette Dixon. Continuing back in time to 1815, meet Kitty Green Stanly, one of the founders of the First Presbyterian Church. She will tell about her story and her husband, freedman Barber Jack Stanly. The Agony Alley Mystery Mansion continues this year with a light-hearted mystery in the Attmore-Oliver House. According to the society, “Poor Mr. Dowd of the Veri-Good Bakery copes with his family in 1928. He is thrilled with his new-fangled purchase for the bakery, not so thrilled with his new partner.” In reality, the Veri-Good Bakery will appear with lots of delicious goodies. As always, candlelit Cedar Grove Cemetery will provide plenty of eerie entertainment on Queen Street. Pass under the weeping gates to meet the cemetery’s famous grave diggers who will try to convince you to stay… forever. Those who get past be on the lookout for the many ghostly characters whose lives shaped the city. A complete listing of ghost sites is on the web: newbernhistorical.org .
