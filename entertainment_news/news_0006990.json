He explained the group promotes equality and does charity work in Sweden.\nBearded Villains, founded in 2014 in Los Angeles, calls itself \"a brotherhood of elite bearded men from all over the world\" on its website.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:55:06.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
