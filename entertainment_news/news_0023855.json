So where you're going, there must be roads.\nThis is not the first time a rideshare company offers free DeLorean rides. Back in 2013, Uber also offered DeLorean rides in San Francisco in partnership with General Electric.\nLyft is not sharing the number of DeLoreans that will travel around the city, but it did say the cars are being shipped from all over the country.\nRelated Stories 2015 predictions 'Back to the Future 2' got right, wrong New on DVD: 'Sex and the City 2,' 'Winter's Bone' Tags: lyft", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOsM-P-WSAo", "http://blog.lyft.com/posts/2015/10/14/back-to-the-future"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:08:44.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
