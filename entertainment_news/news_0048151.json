The incident, which has happened amidst multiple inputs of a terror strike in the capital, took place around 9.30pm on Thursday on platform number 1 of the Rajiv Chowk station.\nThe man, Srivesh Adhikari, belongs to Fatehpur Sikri area near Agra and was on his way to see his ailing father who is admitted in Apollo Hospital. Adhikari sustained a deep bullet wound in his shoulder and is undergoing treatment at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.\nTill late in the night, the cops had not been able to ascertain the motive for this bizarre act. They were also trying to figure out how the man breached the high security at the Chandni Chowk station which is under CISF surveillance. The personnel at the checkpoints are being questioned in this regard.\nCISF has ordered an inquiry into the incident. CCTV footage of the entire route taken by Adhikari is being studied to ascertain the exact sequence of events and lapses. His call records are being checked to find out if the trigger for the incident was a phone call.\nIn a CCTV footage, Adhikari is seen stepping out of the train (going towards Noida) at platform number 1 and heading for gate number 3. He then pulls out the pistol and walks to a corner of the station where he shoots himself.\nHearing the gunshots, policemen and CISF personnel rushed to the spot and found Adhikari lying in a pool of blood. Officials said the man tried to shoot himself in the head but missed perhaps due to the recoil.\nThe police has recovered an ID card from the man's pocket and contacted his family members to inform them about the incident. Adhikari's relatives say he had been depressed due to his father's ailment.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:32:03.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
