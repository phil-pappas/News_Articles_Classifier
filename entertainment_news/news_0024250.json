Baby” and “In the Still of the Night,” mixed with hits “(I've Had) The Time of My Life” and “Hungry Eyes.” Some in the crowd even sang along. \nIt didn’t seem to matter that Eleanor Bergstein’s stage adaptation of her screenplay, which had little resemblance to a musical, had quick scenes that ripped through the rich and promising story of the earnest and idealistic Baby (Gillian Abbott) and her family’s stay at Kellerman’s summer resort. \nThere, she finds Johnny (Christopher Tierney), her first love among the dancers. \nAlso among them is Penny (Jenny Winton), who finds she’s pregnant from an Ivy League student she believed loved her. Baby’s determination to help places her and Penny in a perilous situation that Baby’s father helps rectify — only to lose trust in his daughter. \nThis staged version did include some contrived additions that tried to place the story's era, including Baby giving the audience a brief history lesson at the play's start and scenes with various characters talking about the civil rights movement. Very little of it felt grounded in the story. Parsons Dance promises 'a roller coaster ride' \nGiven the furious pace this staged version took, the actors didn’t have much time to develop their characters. \nBut Abbott as Baby did bring an honesty to her role, and Tierney gave strong street credibility to his portrayal of Johnny. It didn’t hurt that he also oozed with sex appeal. Luckily, that didn’t overshadow his character’s tender moments. Still, there seemed to be very little chemistry between the two. \nHowever, the love between Baby and her father, Dr. Jacke Houseman (Mark Elliot Wilson) was palpable, warm and steady. Their connection came through clearly when Baby asked for $250 without giving her father a reason and later when she admitted to having stayed at Johnny’s overnight. \nThe highlight of this show was the dancing, particularly with Johnny and Penny portrayed by Tierney, who has danced with Chicago’s Hubbard Street Dance as well as ballet companies, and Joffrey Ballet dancer Winton. \nThe moves portrayed both the sensual as well as sweet emotions. Tierney’s scenes rehearsing and teaching Baby, in particular, conveyed the hard work and drive this level of dancing requires. With a lot of choreography packed into short spurts of time throughout the show, sometimes the dancing, particularly the fast-paced partnering, felt a bit too frenzied. \nThere wasn’t much live singing as compared to most musicals, save for several numbers by a handful of singers backed by a tight live band (Many songs that worked as backdrops for the dance numbers were recordings.). Among them, Jennlee Shallow proved impressive in several numbers as did Doug Carpenter singing “In the Still of the Night.” The unfortunate part of these performances was the sound problems where the band’s playing overshadowed the singers’ voices. \nChristopher Tierney (Johnny) and Jenny Winton (Penny) in the North American tour of \"Dirty Dancing – The Classic Story on Stage.\" (Photo: Photo by Matthew Murphy.) \nWhile the movie’s imprint was strong throughout the production, the set, designed by Stephen Brimson Lewis, and the video and projections, designed by Jon Driscoll, constituted an intense visual link to film. \nThe digital projections established scenes at the resort and in fields, forests and, yes, the lake. That scene where Baby is finally able to perform a lift with Johnny while both are in the lake made one of the most appealing scenes using digital technology. But while it evoked oohs and awes, it frequently hindered intimate moments, often overwhelmed the production and sometimes created an irritating glow that distracted from the actors telling of the story.
