Hebert/Invision/AP, File) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Production will begin in December on “Star,” a drama pilot from “Empire” creator Lee Daniels. \nFox, which airs “Empire” and ordered the “Star” pilot, also said that an online casting search is under way for the drama. \nAmong the roles to be filled are those of three female artists trying to make it big in the music industry. \n“Star” will focus on the choices they face as they navigate what the network called the “cutthroat music scene.” \nThe “Star” pilot will be taped in Atlanta, Georgia, Fox said Tuesday. \n“Empire,” also set in the recording business, proved an immediate hit when it debuted last season. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:09:43.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
