The board said it took the step after \"lengthy and serious consideration.\"\nTufts President Anthony Monaco said in an email to the university community that Cosby has shown \"a lack of character and integrity\" that does not represent the school's values.\nGoucher President Jose Antonio Bowen said he and that school's trustees met Wednesday and \"unanimously decided that Cosby's admitted actions are in direct violation of values Goucher holds dear, including our community principles of respect, communication, and responsibility.\"\n\"We must take a consistent stand against sexual misconduct and cannot accept Cosby's conduct as consistent with our values,\" Bowen said.\n\"Had this information been known at the time, I am confident Goucher would not have awarded this honor,\" he said.\nLehigh said earlier this week that Cosby's admitted behavior was \"inconsistent with the character and high standards\" expected of honorees.\nSeveral other schools, including Fordham, Marquette, Baylor and Pennsylvania's Wilkes University, previously pulled their Cosby degrees. In December, amid widening allegations, Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia.\nThe University of Massachusetts-Amherst also has cut ties with Cosby, who earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education there.\nSchools Education Bill Cosby honorary degrees Goucher College Tufts University", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:44:08.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
