Photo Lucasfilm. Related WDBO – Orlando, Fla. ORLANDO, Fla. — \nWalt Disney World in Florida is offering Star Wars fans a special event on the night of the premiere of the newest movie in the franchise. \n\" Star Wars : The Force Awakens\" opens in December. \nThe AMC Disney Springs will offer tickets for a showing of the movie, followed by an after-party at Hollywood Studios. \n>> Read more trending stories \nPrices range from $94.99-99.99 and include a confirmed seat for a showing of \" Star Wars : The Force Awakens\" at the AMC Disney Springs theaters on Dec. 17., plus a Star Wars -themed afterparty at Disney's Hollywood Studios until 2 a.m. Movie showings start at 7 p.m. and will be available in 3D and 3D ETX in addition to traditional 2D, which accounts for the higher-priced tickets. ( ThemeParkInsider ) \nDisney will provide transportation from Disney Springs to the Studios for event participants, but it won't provide transportation back from the Studios to Disney Springs, so that's really only useful to Disney Resort guests who can catch a bus ride back to their hotel from the Studios. For participants who drive themselves to the Studios for the afterparty, parking at the Studios is included in the ticket price. \nTickets go on sale Monday on AMC's website . Disney will release the next trailer for \" Star Wars : The Force Awakens\" during the halftime of \"Monday Night Football\" on Disney-owned ESPN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:34:30.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
