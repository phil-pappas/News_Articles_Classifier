There’s the science fiction type: species-eradicating aliens, viruses that beget zombie apocalypses, and the rise of Terminator-like overlords. These stories are scary because they are silly, with a hint of possibility.\nAnd then there’s the speculative or social science fiction type: surveillance-obsessed governments, book-burning firemen, infertile societies and mass blindness. These stories of dystopian futures are scary because they often spring from all-too-real scenarios.\nMargaret Atwood is a master of the social science fiction novel. The Handmaid’s Tale , published in 1985, takes place in a United States ruled by a theocratic military dictatorship where women have no rights. Oryx and Crake (2003) kicked off a trilogy with an even darker view, where global corporations have run the planet into the ground and a global pandemic has dispensed with most of humanity.\nAtwood, a prolific poet and nonfiction writer, has several children’s books to her credit. She’s also published collections of short stories and won numerous awards. Her book on writing is classroom-worthy. But her new novel, The Heart Goes Last , is a return to writing about frightening futures that seem real and inevitable.\nThe Heart Goes Last begins with our heroes, Charmaine and Stan, living out of their third-hand Honda. They’re victims of a financial meltdown that devastated the northeastern part of the United States, turning it into a lawless land of roving gang rapists. This married couple is constantly on the move, living hand-to-mouth.\nBoth lost great jobs after the tragedy that didn’t seem to affect the rest of the world (or at least not as badly; Oregon is doing well), and now Charmaine is forced to work for meager tips at a seedy bar.\nDuring one of her shifts, Charmaine sees a commercial for the Postitron Project. A group of investors is looking for people to participate in a social and economic experiment that could save humanity. The group offers jobs and a place to live in a new town called Consilience, and Charmaine thinks it sounds lovely. She convinces Stan to apply, and after they are accepted, they begin their new lives in a town that looks like a movie set.\nAt this point, you expect Rod Serling to emerge from the bushes and explain the twist, and there is one, but it doesn’t really make sense. For one month, Charmaine and Stan live a picture-perfect life in a great house with great jobs. The next month, they live as prisoners in the local prison — where they still have pretty good jobs, but they don’t get to see each other. While they are in prison, someone else is living in their house and going to their own jobs, until the month is up, and they switch places again.\nThere are two main rules: You can’t leave Consilience, and you can’t contact your Alternates.\nThe details and dynamics of how this newfound society functions are, disappointingly, glossed over by Atwood, and we find Stan and Charmaine one year into the project. Stan is bored and Charmaine is having a steamy affair with the man who lives in their house while they are in prison.\nSuddenly, the novel tries to shift into a high-paced action mystery, with lots of sex, lies and black-market body parts. Though Stan realizes they are “stuck in a grainy black-and-white retro-thriller movie,” the plot never gets particularly thrilling and is often unintentionally comical.\nAtwood’s writing is crisp. The novel is told in alternating points of view, and Atwood does a wonderful job of conveying Stan and Charmaine’s fears and desires through their thoughts. Her unflinching, no-holds-barred look into the human psyche gives a unique life to her characters: At one moment we are disgusted with Stan and Charmaine’s decisions and actions, the next we are impressed with their ability to survive.\nUltimately, The Heart Goes Last is more love story than social commentary, and though the journey — and especially the Hollywood-easy destination — is filled with holes, the vehicle is not a third-hand Honda; Atwood’s prose and insights make the ride bearable.\nDavid LaBounty quietly awaits the end of the world in Plano.\nPlan your life Margaret Atwood is one of the featured authors at the Texas Book Festival, Oct. 17-18 in Austin.
