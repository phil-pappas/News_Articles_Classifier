Landing online on Monday, October 12, the track finds the rapper at one point addressing his recent bans from Australia and the U.K. which resulted in cancellations of his shows in the countries. As previously reported, Tyler was not allowed to enter Australia and the U.K. due to his lyrics which officials deemed misogynistic and homophobic. On his new track, the Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All leader raps, \"How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass/ How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a f*g? And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion.\" Upon the song's arrival, Tyler told his Twitter followers that he recorded it just two weeks ago and he had trouble giving it a proper title. \"COULDNT COME UP WITH A NAME,\" he wrote. \"I RECORDED THAT TWO WEEKS AGO.\" Now, Tyler is busy preparing his Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival which will return for its fourth edition at L.A.
