He fashioned a screen out of an old computer monitor, used wood to make the face buttons, and then connected them via USB keyboard using tactile switches. Thus, the Cold Boy was born, letting you enjoy a cold one with your favorite retro handheld games.\nIn the event you want one of your own, Daniel is selling them on his personal blog, which you can find here.", "external_links": ["http://modpurist.weebly.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCcJpVaLX3s", "http://www.neatorama.com/2015/09/03/Refrigerator-Is-a-Fully-Functional-Game-Boy/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:10:45.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
