Still, the Central Park crowd celebrated the upcoming birthday of the late Beatle. Lennon would have turned 75 on Friday.\nA Guinness World Records representative says Tuesday's effort brought together more than 2,000 people. But Guinness said 5,000 or more needed to turn out for an official record.\nLennon was assassinated in 1980 at his apartment building on Manhattan's west side just across from the park.\nThe crowd included everyone from aging hippies to schoolchildren not yet born when Lennon died.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/330923371/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-06T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:20:47.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
