(Andy Kropa/Invision) \nA video intro featuring Kardashian family member Kendall riding a futuristic subway with dancers vogueing kicked off the runway show. Models showing the collection featured the Jenner sibling again along with Gigi and Bella Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jourdan Dunn. \n“I think the models I chose are my friends,” said Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing. “All the girls that I love that can grab my hand and just say, ‘Don’t worry, It’s gonna be fun.’ It’s a night of love and of friendship and of fun.” \nClothing ranged from beaded jackets, draped trousers and genie pants. At the end of the runway portion of the presentation, the Backstreet Boys performed a medley of some of their hits. (Andy Kropa/Invision) \nThe Balmain x H&M line is intended to be more affordable than the designer’s main line, although some pieces are still priced at more than 500 US dollars (well over £300). The collection goes on sale in the US on November 5. \nHere’s who turned out for the party.
