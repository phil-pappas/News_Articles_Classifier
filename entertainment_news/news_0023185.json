He's had purple patches and also lean spells. But the actor now seems to have cracked the code of staying happy.\n\"I have experienced both the phases in my career, so in a way I am comfortable with both,\" says Kunchacko, who is currently filming Rajesh Pillai's Vettah in Ernakulam.\nHe explains that though there would obviously be disappointment when his films don't do well, he makes it a point to stay upbeat - on and off the set. \"I try to enjoy each moment and stay positive at the end of it,\" says the Traffic star.\nOn dealing with his fans' expectations over the years, Kunchacko tells us, \"They always expect a lot more and that's what drives every actor. But lately I also give priority to my happiness. I now know what I am capable of and it has helped me manage expectations.\"\nHe also clarifies that the audience is now smart and an actor has to be extra careful when it comes to selecting projects.\n\"A large fan base doesn't mean they will drive your movie's box-office collections if the script is horrible,\" he says, adding that people appreciate only \"good movies now.\"\nKunchacko's next release will be an all-out comedy, Rajamma@Yahoo , which also stars Asif Ali, Nikki Galrani and Anusree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:31:45.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
