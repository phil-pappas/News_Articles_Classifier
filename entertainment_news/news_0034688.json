Within the frames of his visit, he will present a lecture titled “The Ilkhanate History”, on October 9 at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. He paid honor to monuments of Bileg Khan and Kul Tigin, in Kharkhorin, Uvurkhangai. He also presented a lecture titled “Jami al-tawarikh” (Compendium of Chronicles) at the Mongolian University of Science and Technology, and “Museum Studeis” lecture at Bogd Khaan Palace Museum on October 12. The main goal of his visit was to establish cooperation with Bogd Khaan Palace Museum. Ilber Ortayli said, “I have worked as director of the Topkaki Palace Museum in Istanbul from 2005 to 2012. Over three million tourists visit our museum, and we have lots of sponsors. I toured around Bogd Khaan Palace Museum and really liked it. The exhibits of the museum are so incredible and have kept Mongolian culture. Also I think exhibits in Bogd Khan Palace Museum are related to Mongolian Buddhism.” “The building of the museum is a little bit old and it has no sponsors. I heard that the state doesn’t care much about the museum. I’d like to increase the number of tourists and local audiences who want to see Bogd Khan Palace Museum”, he added. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16527   13  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:00:40.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
