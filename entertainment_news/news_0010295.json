Grille Midtown reinvents itself with new name, menu \nThe Shinola pop-up will start simply, partner Michael Chetcuti said, offering six wrapped-and-ready cold sandwiches in a display case at the store’s sales terminals. They’ll be prepared at Bigalora using DelSignore’s recipes, so the first phase — set to begin mid-next week — will require no additional employees or cooking at Shinola. \nIf that goes well, Chetcuti says, the next step might have Shinola employees toasting the already-assembled panini so customers could have hot sandwiches. \nDelSignore said the idea came about because Shinola’s owners wanted healthier food options in the neighborhood. The sandwiches they’ll offer include two vegan and two vegetarian options, and the breads will be made with the all-natural biga starter used in Bigalora’s pizza dough. \nThe much more ambitious project at Detroit Medical Center could be open by late December or early January, DelSignore said. \nIt’s part of a major renovation that will create a new front entrance for the DMC campus, DelSignore said, and turn the entire first floor of the area into a food destination with concepts from three highly regarded vendors. \nDMC has announced it is building a new entrance at Hutzel Hospital, but a spokesperson declined to discuss other details about the project, which is still in the final stages of development. \nOn one side of the dining area will be a Mexican concept called Chiqui (Spanish slang for \"little brother\"), opened by Adam Baru, owner of Ann Arbor’s Isalita and Mani Osteria restaurants, and his brother, Michael Baru. Papa Joe’s Gourmet Markets, the high-end grocer and caterer known for its prepared foods in Birmingham and Rochester Hills, will occupy the larger, middle section, DelSignore said. \nAnd on the other side of the dining space, opposite Chiqui, Bigalora will have a 1,500-square-foot free-standing concept, “almost like our own little building,” where customers can see their pizzas being fired in 90 seconds and select from a wide variety of grab-and-go items, DelSignore said. He will also offer fresh pastas and probably sandwiches and panini. \nAll three restaurateurs hope to open at the same time, he said. “When we open, we want to open with a bang.” Farmington Hills woman opens Detroit breakfast cafe \nThe new Rochester Hills Bigalora will occupy the large restaurant space that previously was the Hill, at the end of the L-shaped shopping area anchored by Papa Joe’s, north of downtown Rochester. The renovation is in the final stages of design with a target opening date of February. \nThe 160-seat McNamara Terminal restaurant, set in a prime location at the bottom of the escalator just past security, should be open by Thanksgiving, DelSignore said. It will have a full Bigalora menu of pizzas fired in 90 seconds, pastas, grab-and-go items, desserts, panini and Bigalora’s full brunch menu, since the restaurant will serve breakfast daily. \nStrictly speaking, the pop-up and DMC locations won’t be Bigalora’s first foray into Detroit, since it has club-level service at Ford Field. But that’s accessible to a relatively tiny audience. \nAsked when Bigalora might bring the city a full-scale Bigalora, Chetcuti wouldn’t offer a date and would only say, \"It's on the short list.” \nBut DelSignore eliminated any remaining doubt: “Bricks-and-mortar is inevitable in Detroit. It's inevitable,\" he said. \nContact writer Sylvia Rector: 313-222-5026 and srector@freepress.com.
