Reports are flying that Taika Waititi, known for his works in HBO series \" Flight of the Conchords \" and mockumentary \"What We Do in the Shadows\" has been trusted to direct \"mThor: for Marvel. Waititi is still in negotiations stage, a source told The Wrap . He moved up in the list, reportedly overshadowing Ruben Fleischer, Rob Letterman and Rawson Marshall Thurber in the process. Marvel is yet to response to the report. Hiring Waititi could be an odd choice but it follows a pattern. Alan Taylor, who directed \" Thor: The Dark World \" was first known for his television works such as \"Game of Thrones\" and \"tThe Joe and Anthony Russo directed for such series as \" Arrested Development \" and \" Community \" before landing the coveted job in \" Captain America: The Winter Soldier \". \"Thor: Ragnarok\" will be released on July 28, 2017. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the hammer-wielding superhero, joined by Tom Hiddleston and Jaimie Alexander . Script is written by \"Thor: The Dark World\" co-scribes Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Thor: Ragnarok News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:25:41.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
