The Duke of Cambridge opened up about his children during a visit to the Cambridge college of St John's, where he completed a 12-week agriculture course last year and was returning to, to open a new archive. \nHe described daughter Charlotte, who was born on 2 May this year, as already 'very ladylike' and with a personality befitting a princess, despite being only five months old, while his first born son was by comparison, \"somewhat lively.\" \nPrince William made the comments when Christopher Dobson, the college's master, presented the Duke with a children's book which he promised to read to George and Charlotte. \n\"He remarked that the children were delightful but that they had different characters, with George being lively and Charlotte being very ladylike,\" Professor Dobson said. \"It was good to welcome him back. We have fond memories of his time here and he was one of the easiest guests we ever had.\" \nSpeaking at a dinner in Whitehall to mark 21 years of Child Bereavement UK, for which he is now a patron, Prince William also hinted at his own experience of loss following the tragic death of his mother Princess Diana. \nAccording to Mail Online , he explained that having children has helped him to appreciate the work of the bereavement charity that his late mother helped to launch. \"What my mother recognised back then – and what I understand now – is that grief is the most painful experience that any child or parent can endure. \n\"But my mother was determined to help those in need and she would have been immensely proud – as I am – of all that Child Bereavement UK has achieved,\" he explained. When many people slink away at the sight of a friend's bereavement, CBUK's staff embrace strangers at the darkest moment in their life. As a father to two young children, I now appreciate it all the more.\" \nChild Bereavement UK supports families and educates professionals when a baby or child of any age dies or is dying, or when a child is facing bereavement.
