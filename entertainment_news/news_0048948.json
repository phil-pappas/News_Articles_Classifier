By Allison Hersh In the summer of 2014, Henry Dean painted his way across the Isle of Sky on Scotland’s west coast, creating intimate, dreamy canvases defined by mountains, lochs and cloudscapes.\nThis past summer, he kayaked along estuaries in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, strategically placing canvases in the marsh and allowing the tides to deposit layers of sediment.\n“Creeks + Folds,” a new solo exhibition at the City of Savannah’s Cultural Arts Gallery, combines three distinct bodies of work: plein air paintings created during the artist’s sabbatical in Scotland, a three-dimensional installation, and immersive paintings crafted by submerging canvases in tidal rivers.\nRegardless of the medium at hand, Dean is keenly observant and finely attuned to his surroundings. At once organic and ephemeral, these works of art find deep inspiration in the natural world.\nDean, a longtime Foundation Studies professor at the Savannah College of Art and Design, recently spoke with the Savannah Morning News about waterways, history and the joys of painting.\nHow did the idea for this particular body of work come about?\nAs a painter, I love making works that express the forms and colors of the landscape in works that are partly inspired by traditions that go back to Constable, Turner, Monet, Cezanne and Degas. But I felt I had to find an expression that more truly expressed the holistic “truth” of what the Earth as an environment in space, forever changing, represents.\nSo I had this idea of leaving stretched and gessoed canvases, mounted on engineered easel “rigs” in the tidal marshes. This action meant exposing the precious form of the picture plane, the armature, and making it vulnerable to the forces of nature and man, leaving it unprotected overnight for weeks at a time.\nSome canvases were installed, mostly in the wetlands north of where I live on Talahi Island, in creeks accessible at high tide only. This “private” practice, where my audience was almost entirely underwater life and wildfowl, gave me time to learn about the way water works, the sediment tides carry as they come in through river channels and drain off swaths of Spartina grass and pluff mud.\nWhat kind of effect were you after with your immersive paintings?\nI wanted each panel to suggest something unique, like all my paintings. Positioning the canvases in different locations was one way to achieve this goal.\nFor the month of June, I did nothing but kayak around the waterways adjacent to the Port Royal Sound Foundation Maritime Center. The Chechessee River is a part of Port Royal Sound. Its waters\nare mostly saline, as opposed to the brackish waters of the Savannah River wetlands in our area.\nWhat became immediately apparent after immersing the 10 panels was the impact of the specific location of the rig on the mark-making on the canvas. Panel #1, located on the south side of the inlet close to the river proper, went very dark, very quickly! Panel #19, which I consider one of the most beautiful, was right on the river, at the south side on the inlet. It had a moment when there was a build up, then strangely became marked with delicate striations caused by tidal action.\nWhy are “analog experiences,” as you refer to time spent away from the digital world, important to you?\nThis is the beginning of a new exploration and direction in my work. It’s exciting, since it represents a way to speak to two things that seem to occupy my thoughts a lot of the time: the world of analog experience based on sensations caused by forces that are beyond our control and the world mediated through the picture plane, where everything is designed and fabricated.\nThis latter world is affecting our beings, habits, lives and actions. It is changing the way we think and feel. It is uncharted territory. As a teacher, I accept the new technology. I use it. It is useful. However, I feel strongly that we have to be more open in recognizing lives led “online,” and discussing strategies for maintaining analog experiences, which I believe are an essential part of being human.\nHow did your experiences in Scotland influence your painting style?\nScotland was so inspiring! Each location came with a history, with myths attached. I visited places saints stayed at during the darkest days of the Dark Ages. As I worked, I thought of them and their challenges, of the Viking marauders who raided, terrorized and enslaved the inhabitants.\nI went to places where people living off the land were forcibly “removed” during the time of the enclosures. I saw the ruins of their settlements, heard locals speak of these times and the way that the old life of living off the land and the rich seas.\nDid you discover any unexpected connections between Scotland and the Lowcountry?\nAs I researched the history, went to the places, met the local inhabitants speaking their Gaelic tongue, visited the churchyards, saw the mining industries, I thought about home in the Lowcountry — about people who came to Georgia and South Carolina in the 18th century.\nSkye and the Lowcounty are connected in many ways, literally and metaphorically. I hope the “Creeks and Folds” exhibition reveals such connections, but I intend for this to be suggest\ned in ways that my audience can pick up and feel in their own way, drawing their own conclusions.\nThe works I did on Skye used more strongly saturated colors than previous plein air work. Partly this was because the colors were there, revealed by shifts in light that came and went with the wind, and partly because the feelings and response to what was there in front of me were intense.\nWhat do you love most about the act of painting?\nWorking with media. Finding metaphors and meaning in the process involved in painting. Discovering new ways of making marks. Learning to get better. Finding resolution in composing with colors, forms and textures. Expressing ideas through abstraction and representation.\nWhat did you learn from working on this particular project?\nSaline water is very different from brackish water! Port Royal Sound is unique, as is the history and culture of the South Carolina Lowcountry, but our Georgia home is close in many ways. Scotland is far away from the USA, but there’s a shared heritage. The unique experience of different races is important, but finding the connections reveals our collective consciousness.\nAt a time in history when divisiveness seems on the rise all over the world, when changes in climate present challenges, education is critical. It allows us to recognize ways we are similar, in terms of shared experiences and histories, celebrating one Earth, learning and relearning that we all are stewards of the land.\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nHenry Dean earned an MFA in painting from the Savannah College of Art and Design and an M.A. in Fine Arts and Geography from St. Andrews University in Fife, Scotland.
