He said the work on third phase of Mumbai Metro – from Colaba in South Mumbai to SEEPZ in western suburb – would start soon. Also, Delhi Metro Rail Corp (DMRC) has been asked to carry out a study on extending the metro line beyond Dahisar to cover Bhayander area in Thane district, Fadnavis said. \nThe report of DMRC is likely to come to us within a couple of months, he said. By 2017, all the cities and towns in the state will be made free of open defecation, he said, adding adequate number of toilets would made available in these places. \nDuring his visit, the Chief Minister performed ‘bhoomi pooja’ for a new administrative building of Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC), flagged off new buses and took part in other programmes. \n  25, 2015 3:05 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:09:20.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
