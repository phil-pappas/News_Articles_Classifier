Pic/ Santa Banta \n\"It was amazing meeting Joanna, and it was everything meeting Joanna. And I was very nervous about meeting her because I look nothing like her. I myself look absolutely nothing like Joanna Hoffman, and she looks nothing like me,\" Winslet said.\nThe \"Reader\" actress said the looks did not matter much as she was interested more in the backstory of Hoffman, than acing her expressions or reactions.\n\"I loved spending time with her because she shared stories with me about her time with Steve and her relationship with Steve that a lot of people just don't know anything about.\n\"And I actually came to understand a much softer, gentler side of Steve Jobs, a side of Steve Jobs who I think was kept sort of hidden away and private to those people or to his family.\"\n\"Steve Jobs\" stars Michael Fassbender in the titular role, Seth Rogen, as Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, Jeff Daniels as former Apple CEO John Sculley, along with Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg.
