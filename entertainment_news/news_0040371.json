He stars as maverick cop Axel Foley in the third and final installment of the Beverly Hills Cop movies. This time round, he returns to LA when an investigation into a colleague's murder leads him to a Hollywood theme park. He gets old ally Rosewood on board to help him prove the resort is a cover for a major counterfeiting ring connected to a terrorist conspiracy. Undoubtedly, one of the BEST scenes of all the movies is in this one, when Foley finds himself dangling from the terrifying heights of a Big Wheel in pursuit of a suspect, all while the catchy theme music plays in the background. Remember? Doo, doo, dodadoo, doo do... Yeah okay, I'll stop now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:06:05.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
