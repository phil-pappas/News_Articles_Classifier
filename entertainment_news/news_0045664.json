(Photo: Trisha Harris/Submitted photo) \nChef Josh Eslinger from Crush Eleven in Cocoa Village will defend his title Oct. 6 when nine of Brevard's favorite chefs face off for the March of Dimes. \nEslinger earned top honors in People's Choice and Best of Show divisions at last year's Signature Chefs Auction, a food-centric event that raises money to support the March of Dimes mission for healthier babies. This year's event will be from 6-9 p.m. Oct. 6 at Hilton Rialto Place in Melbourne. Tickets start at $200. \n\"The chefs really, truly like the competition part,\" said Gregory C. Stephens, March of Dimes Division Director. \"You get sort of a mini meal with each chef.\" \nIn addition to Eslinger, this year's participants are: Chef Lance Cook, Eau Gallie Yacht Club in Indian Harbour Beach Chef Dave Dashi, Amici's Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria in Suntree Chef Donald Edge, Melbourne Hilton Rialto Place Chef Brad Francis, Crowne Plaza Melbourne Oceanfront Chef Jeff Kainz, Ocean 302 Bar & Grill in Melbourne Beach Chef Matt Nugnes, Matt's Casbah in Melbourne Chef Ron Shrouds, D.I.G. Bistro in Suntree Chef Nate St. Dennis, The Fat Snook in Cocoa Beach \nThe chefs donate not only their time, but also enough food for more than 200 event guests, Stephens said. In addition to a People's Choice vote, Best of Show will be awarded by a panel of executive chefs. Food will be judged on presentation, color, creativity, use of local ingredients and taste. \nIt's a fun event that gives Brevardians a chance to sample dishes from restaurants they may not have tried before, Stephens said. But the fun benefits a serious purpose. The 75-year-old organization has embarked on a campaign to end premature births. \nAccording to March of Dimes statistics, premature birth is the No. 1 cause of death in newborns; 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely; and the annual cost of prematurity in the United States is more than $26 billion. \nIn 2011, the March of Dimes launched the first of five Prematurity Research Centers at Stanford University, according to prematurityresearch.org . As of this year, all five centers have come online, with research taking place at an Ohio Collaborative among three Ohio universities and seven hospitals, Washington University, University of Pennsylvania and a collaborative with University of Chicago, Northwestern and Duke. \nChairing the auction at this year's Signature Chefs event are attorneys Rob and Michelle Naberhause. The Naberhauses have five healthy children. \n\"Signature Chefs gives the community the chance to come together for stronger, healthier babies and make a difference in the lives of millions of babies,\" Michelle Naberhause said in a press release. \nAlso helping with the event will be Mike & Mindy from Lite Rock 99.3, who will act as hosts, and Sheriff Wayne Ivey, who will be the evening's auctioneer. Patrick and Aran Hissam, the Ambassador Family for March of Dimes Space Coast, will share the story of their daughter Brianna Marie before the Fund the Mission portion of the live auction. \nMore information about the event is available at signaturechefs.org/melbourne .
