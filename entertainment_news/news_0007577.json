From the seeds of one of the world’s most enduring conflicts comes an inspiring musical collaboration, as two classical pianists -- Yaron Kohlberg and Bishara Haroni -- find harmony and a peace their nations have yet to enjoy.\nTheir name, ‘Amal’, means hope in Arabic -- a Palestinian and an Israeli, playing as one. And their aspirations are great -- to achieve top musical form together and inspire the outside world to pay attention and work – together as well – to alleviate Middle Eastern tension.\nIsraeli Yaron Kohlberg is the winner of many prestigious international prizes, including a first prize in the Parnassos International Competition in Monterrey. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras around the world and performs regularly in chamber music concerts with the American duo Parnas and with Danish cellist Roke Moldrup.\nPalestinian Bishara Haroni plays regularly as a soloist and chamber musician in many famous venues, and collaborates with major orchestras, conductors and instrumentalists. As a concert soloist, he has enjoyed associations with major orchestras in Europe, the United States, Asia and the Middle East.\nJoining together, at Kohlberg’s suggestion, in 2008, the duo has continued to gain recognition and success by showing how music-making at the highest level can transcend political and national differences.\nPrevious Duo Amal concerts have taken place in the Beijing Concert Hall, New York’s Carnegie Hall, the Copenhagen Piano Festival, Israel Philharmonic, the Palestinian Symphony Orchestra, and in the London City Festival. All in all, the pair has performed in twenty-two countries across the globe.\n“With tension rising in the region, this musically rich concert will be a symbol of hope and friendship,” says Randi Benesch, Managing Director of the Gordon Center. “We are proud to present, for the first time in Baltimore, these two brilliant musicians, who have come together to share with us a beautiful vision for peace.”\nJoin us for this incredible evening.
