The director, producer, screenwriter and stand-up comedian who has had his hand in creating comedic films such as “Knocked Up,” “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” “Bridesmaids,” “Superbad” and most recently, “Trainwreck,” which stars Amy Schumer, gets down this way with his wife and two daughters as often as possible.\nSome of his favorite people are from O.C. including his wife, actress Leslie Mann who graduated from Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach. Actor, writer, musician and comedian Steve Martin, who grew up in Garden Grove, was the reason Apatow said he got into comedy in the first place and of course, his longtime friend and one of the biggest comedic stars in Apatow’s films is actor Will Ferrell, who was born and raised in Irvine.\nOrange County is also a place where Apatow cut his teeth in the stand-up world, doing off nights and opening sets at the original Irvine Improv location at University Town Center near UC Irvine in the early ’90s.\nThough his work on films, as well as TV shows such as “Freaks and Geeks,” “Undeclared” and HBO’s hit series, “Girls,” has kept him out of the solo spotlight of a stand-up stage for nearly two decades, Apatow has slowly returned to his original love and will be doing two sets in the revamped Irvine Improv (now located at the Irvine Spectrum Center) on Friday.\n“The crowds in Irvine were always fantastic,” the 47-year-old said during a recent phone interview, noting that he hasn’t yet been to the new Improv location. “I hear that hasn’t changed a bit so I think this is going to be good. I mean, it’s Irvine, the land of Will Ferrell, how can the comedy fans not be great?”\nWhile shooting the movie “Trainwreck” Apatow said he found himself growing jealous of Schumer, who would come to the set after being out and doing her stand-up in sold-out clubs and theaters all over the country on the weekends. Since they were filming in New York, he hit up the Comedy Cellar and wound up doing short sets nearly every night for the duration of the shooting.\n“I realized that I missed it,” he said. “I felt like doing that made me a funnier, better director on the movie because I was just waking up some other dormant parts of my brain. When you’re directing and writing, you’re really all by yourself most of the time, so it’s nice to have a direct relationship with the crowd and not just sitting in the back of a movie theater and hoping that they laugh.”\nIt’s that sort of immediate response he missed the most, noting that he could work on a film or television project for two to five years before “finding out if people like it, hate it, if it’s a success or a complete humiliation.”\nLast year, Apatow began putting together comedy and music shows, dubbed Judd Apatow and Friends a couple of times a month at Largo, not far from his home in Los Angeles. Comics such as Adam Sandler, Louis C.K. and Bill Burr have all joined in alongside musicians including Fiona Apple and Jackson Browne. The proceeds from these evenings always goes to charity.\n“That’s a fun way for me to perform and raise a lot of money,” he said. “I also get to work with my friends, which is really the reason why I’m doing that because I enjoy it and it’s a fun way to stay connected with what everyone is doing.”\nWhile in Irvine this week, he’ll be doing “good ol’ fashioned stand-up” and working out some new material ahead of a gig at Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14 as part of the New York Comedy Festival.\n“I’m doing some headlining shows to prepare for that,” he said. “I’m trying to do whatever I need to do for that not to become some kind of classic travesty.”\nOn top of having “Trainwreck” come out this year, Apatow released a book in June titled, “Sick in the Head: Conversations About Life and Comedy.” He had also been hard at work on the upcoming comedy film “Pee-wee’s Big Holiday,” which will be released on Netflix next spring. Apatow recalls catching Pee-wee actor Paul Reubens doing stand-up in New York in the early ‘80s and it being one of the best sets he’s ever seen.\nHe has another romantic comedy series on Netflix in the works titled “Love,” which will debut in the spring. He also currently producing a music-based comedy feature film for the Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone) that will be out next summer.\n“Now do you see what I’m saying, I’m going to have to wait a long time to know if people like those,” he said with a laugh.\nContact the writer: 714-796-3570 or kfadroski@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:19:23.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
