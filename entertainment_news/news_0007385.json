Has Joe Schmidt been keeping his cards close to his chest? Possibly, but even if so, how ready are the replacements for Paul O'Connell, Sean O'Brien, Jared Payne, and Peter O'Mahony to implement this secret gameplan we've heard so much about. Argentina have looked quality in their group matches, but haven't had a real test since losing to New Zealand on the opening day of the tournament. How is it going to go? We've no idea, but you can bet we'll be watching to find out.\n3.30pm: Australia vs Scotland\nKick-Off: 4.00pm\nStadium: Twickenham\nWe're not saying Scotland don't deserve to be here, we're just saying that game against Japan might have been a lot closer had they not entered into it fresh off the back of no previous game, while Japan togged out just a few short days after toppling The Springboks. But we're past that now, and the Scots have a chance to make an unlikely semi-final, and all that's in there way is arguably the team of the tournament so far. Easy, right? They'll have to pull one out of the bag if they want to face the winners of Ireland vs Argentina.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:07:35.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
