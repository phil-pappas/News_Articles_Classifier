The character had sprung a surprise, not just on her, but on several of his fans too, who were used to seeing the by then 60-plus Dadamoni, as he was fondly known in sober character roles, usually as the good father instead of chasing after stolen diamonds and women.\n\"I was bored. I wanted to play a character with shades of grey, and this one presented me with the opportunity within the format of a comedy. Thoda different role tha,\" the veteran actor had explained. He had known all 36 dialogues by heart, many of the punch lines coming spontaneously while shooting with Pran who played his partner-in-crime, Rana.\nPran admitted that Ashok Kumar and he, who went on to make a viable jodi after this surprise hit, had shared an almost telepathic rapport. \"Whenever any director would go to Dadamoni with a dialogue sheet, he would wave it away saying, 'I will do whatever Pran does.' Most of our lines in Victoria No. 203 were improvised on the spot. Dadamoni would start a sentence and I would complete it or vice versa. It was a kind of exchange you had never seen before on screen and it worked wonderfully,\" he says.\nRaja and Rana are two small-time crooks who plan to walk the straight path after a stint in prison. But their noble intentions evaporate when they hear about a theft. The trail for the missing diamonds leads them to a horse carriage, Victoria No. 203, whose driver is Rekha (Saira Banu). She poses as a man during the day and is a secret agent by night, trying to seduce Ranjeet with a \"Thoda Sa Thahro\" in an attempt to gather evidence that will help her spring her father who is imprisoned for a murder he did not commit. The son of the kingpin of a smuggling racket, Kumar (Navin Nischol) with a mystery surrounding his birth, and a crowd of henchmen who are constantly switching sides, come together to stir up a potpourri which had all the Bollywood masala and a plot with plenty of twists and turns.\nThe film was produced and directed by Brij. His son, Kamal Sadanah, who was a boy of two when the film released, remembers that Victoria No. 203 was one of his father's most successful films, and brought along a financial windfall which made it possible for the family to move into a bungalow and scale up their lifestyle.\n\"I saw the film countless times on a projector at home, on birthdays, anniversaries, every special occasion,\" laughs Kamal, admitting that he still has the diamonds from the film. \"Of course, they are not the real thing but specialised crystals. And the lamp of the Victoria in which they had been hidden, would hang from one of the walls at home for years, as a kind of a memento.\"\nPran and Ashok Kumar's song, \"Do Bechare Bina Sahare\", is one of the highlights of this comic caper, underlining their on-screen camaraderie. Twelve years later, Shibu Mitra made a film, Raja Aur Rana, with Ashok Kumar and Pran in the title role. But this time, they couldn't whip up another box-office hit.\nIn 2007, Kamal himself produced a faithful remake of the original film. Victoria No. 203: Diamonds Are Forever had Anupam Kher and Om Puri playing Raja and Rana. When he told Pran about the project, the actor asked Kamal to tell his actors to be spontaneous rather than rehearsed. \"Many of our scenes were impromptu and that's what worked for Dadamoni and me,\" he reminded Kamal, who still chuckles over their antics, whether its serenading a fisher-woman or all at sea in the sea.\nHowever, the new jodi couldn't pull off the classic act and the film failed to impress. \"Maybe we should have modernised the script a little. You can't copy sequences and performances,\" admits the producer in retrospect. However, a shot-to-shot copy of the climax, including the set and the action, worked for Aamir (Khan) and Salman (Khan) in the 1994 Rajkumar Santoshi directed laugh riot, Andaz Apna Apna.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:02:26.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
