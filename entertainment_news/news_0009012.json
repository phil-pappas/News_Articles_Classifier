Tony recorded this on his phone and this was so funny to watch! As he was talking to Luca all you saw was the back of his head, not moving. At no point when Tony said something did Luca's ears go up or his head turn around to look at him. Luca was totally ignoring Tony. Then Tony said \"do you want to go to daycare\" Luca's head spun around, his ears were up, he quickly got up and suddenly was very attentive to Tony. Luca even looked like he had a smile on his face!\n•Loves: Puppy Palace Day Care\n•Tricks: He can sit, stay, lay, give kisses, roll over, give high five and now catch a treat balanced off his nose.\n•Exercise: Running with his doggie friends.\n•Nicknames: Luca-do\n•Shows affection by: When he lays by you he has to touch you, usually laying right over your feet.\n•Can usually be found: In our family room chewing on a treat or bone.\n•Likes to be rubbed: Belly rubs are the best!\n•Favorite toy: Anything. Toys usually last him about 10 minutes before all the stuffing is out of them.\n•Favorite treat: Bully Sticks or Bully Rings. Great Dog Treats.\n•Afraid of: Being outside by himself! We always have to go outside with him for him to go to the bathroom.\n•Worst habit: We always have to go outside with him for him to go to the bathroom!\n•Health scares: Yes since he was a sick puppy he seems to catch things easily.. he's had an eye and ear infection already but everything cleared up after his VET visit.\n•Favorite sleeping spot: He has a nice comfortable crate that he seems to enjoy. He is only in it at night since he is a puppy. But I notice when he is tired during the day he will go and lay in it on his own sometime.\n•Favorite animal friend: My cat Sebastian. Rosie my other cat has not yet come around.\n•Strange but true: Can run for 10-12 hours at day care but passes out after I take him for a 30 minute walk.\n•Comments: My husband and I drove from PA to MO to adopt this sweet puppy. He was almost put to sleep three times. Once in a high kill shelter along with his mother and sister. Then after that he was very sick with numerous ailments from being at the shelter. The wonderful people at Midwest Animal Resue decided to take a chance on him. After he recouped from those illness he got sick again with a bad infection that ate a hole through his chest wall. Again the wonderful people at Midwest paid for his treatment. When we heard his story we knew we had to adopt him. He had such a rough start in his little life. His adoption was posted in December and his name was Elf. We adopted him in January and he has been spoiled rotten by us since we brought him home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:00:40.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
