T he Chatham County Board of Assessors is one of those nameless, faceless, arms of the local bureaucracy that seldom make it into the spotlight, which is unfortunate, because this appointed board’s actions can affect every single property owner in Chatham County.\nAnd by the time citizens find out what this board had done, they are often powerless to respond.\nLast month, this newspaper reported that a number of Broughton Street businesspeople and property owners were caught flatfooted by huge increases in their 2015 property values, as determined by the county’s Tax Assessor’s Office. That means their county, city, and school tax bills, all due in November, will go through the roof.\nAnd while that may be good news for the County Commission, City Council and School Board, as it means more revenue to spend and makes budget balancing easier, it’s a major burden for small business owners with long-term leases that make them responsible for paying tax bills on their leased property. Take the case of Joseph Dabit, who owns buildings at 26 and 28 W. Broughton St. He said he has nothing against progress on Broughton Street, largely driven by investor Ben Carter, but he wasn’t prepared or pleased for what he saw upon receiving his 2015 property tax bill a few weeks ago.\nThe amount he owes for one of the buildings jumped from $7,870 to $29,383 — a 273 percent jump. The other bill jumped to more than $27,000. And the property value for 28 West Broughton St. jumped from $689,800 in 2014 to almost $1.8 million in 2015— a 160-percent jump. So what happened? While some increase can be expected, as property improvements in a given neighborhood tend to inflate the values of surrounding properties. Just as a rising tide lifts all boats. But lifting them to the stratosphere seems a bit much.\n“They told me they took a broad brush and raised everybody,” Dabit said of speaking with the Chatham County Board of Assessors.\nTurns out that’s not entirely the case. The brush strokes were selective. But that doesn’t mean Mr. Dabit and others in his position shouldn’t be steamed.\nAs it turned out, what they didn’t know about actions by the county’s Tax Assessor’s Office back in April and reported at that time to the county Board of Assessors are coming back to bite them in their wallets. Hard.\nAccording to a report this week in the Savannah Business Journal, this appointed board met quietly away from the limelight, like it normally does, and heard from Rod Conley, Chatham County’s Chief Tax assessor.\nHe informed the board of a major decision he was making, mostly unilaterally: He was changing the way his office values certain categories of commercial property across the county for tax purposes. Instead of using sales prices, which traditionally has been the way county assessors value real estate, they will now use a formula that focuses on the square footage of a retail store and rental rate per square feet. In other words, the county is moving from a “cost based” system to one that is “income based.”\nMr. Conley defended his decision, telling the Business Journal, that he is simply following the wishes of the Georgia Department of Revenue to fairly and accurately assess property values, getting it as close as possible to its “true value,” which apparently isn’t what a willing buyer will pay a willing seller. Instead, it’s apparently how much money that piece of property generates for its owner.\nExcept it’s not that simple. While it’s true that the Revenue Department is responsible for overseeing certain aspects of the local process to see that property taxes are assessed uniformly and otherwise administered properly by county tax officials. The state agency accomplishes this goal by providing training, guidance, and technical assistance and issuing, when necessary, orders to correct errors in county tax rolls (digests) or assessment procedures.\nBut county boards of assessors have some influence over local office operations and policies. For one thing, they hire, fire and discipline the tax assessor over how the office does businesses.\nAbout 15 years ago, this board was under a microscope and in a hotbed of public criticism for mismanagement and poor public relations after it filed about 40 lawsuits against county property owners who had won favorable appeals of higher property valuations from the Board of Equalization.\nJeff Rayno, who had just been elected to the county commission at that time, cited a critical state audit that accused the board of political favoritism.\nThen, there was the question of who at the courthouse was responsible for reducing the valuation on the Modena Island home owned by then-Commisssion Chairman Billy Hair to cut his annual tax bill by $16,000. That mystery was never solved by the board, other than learning through an internal investigation that someone with access to the computer used a fake ID and the name (R. Kimbell) to make the changes. The board found out that at least 12 other property owners got similar fraudulent “tax breaks.”\nFortunately, the public had board members who were looking out for the public’s interests at that time, led by Chairman Joe Vestal. The chief appraiser at that time was rightly suspended without pay, as Mr. Vestal and others vowed to make this backwater of county government more transparent and responsive. So what happened between then and now?\nThe current board, chaired by Terry Tolbert, and members Tommy Boondry, Art Gunter and Laura Hegstrom, failed to notify property owners of Mr. Conley’s decision to change how certain properties are valued and give the public an opportunity to comment. That was a major lapse in government.\nThey had to have known that Mr. Conley’s move would have major tax ramifications and that public hearings were in order. And if they didn’t, they shouldn’t serve on this board and should tender their resignations. And the Chatham County Commission, which appoints these board members, shares some of that blame, as it failed to pick appointees who understand how government is supposed to work for the good of the community.\nNot surprisingly, elected officials at City Hall, the county courthouse and school board office are probably cheering the tax board’s sleight of hand. That’s because Mr. Conley’s quiet move caused the county’s net property digest to shoot from $11,766,293,877 to $12,168,868,165 in one year, according to the Business Journal. Such dramatic growth means a tax revenue windfall for the city, county and school board budgets at the expense of clueless property owners, sparing elected officials of the politically risky decision to raise the property tax rate. But that’s not how taxing and spending are supposed to work.\nIf elected officials need more money they must make the case for higher taxes in public and defend their decisions, not hide behind faceless bureaucrats like Mr. Conley and let him do their dirty work.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:24:16.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
