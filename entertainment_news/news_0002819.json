There will be a potluck supper, so attendees are asked to bring a dish to pass. \nAs always, beginners, curious friends and passing strangers are welcome to join the group in song. The singing is primarily from “The Sacred Harp,” 1991 Denson edition, a shape note tune book that has been in continuous publication with periodic revisions since 1844. The music consists of hymns, fugue-ing tunes, anthems and other songs in a style rooted in Colonial New England. Shape note singing was popular in Maine up until the Civil War and in areas of the rural south and west to the present day. Books will be available to borrow or purchase. \nFor more information, call Barb Ames at 841-4923 or email singing@mainesacredharp.org. Dutchneck Road is off Route 32 south; the chapel is about two miles up the left fork. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
