The triplets were delivered via C-section after about 33.5 weeks in the womb. Each of the boys weighed 3 to 5 pounds.\nThe couple's doctor, Dr. Victor A. Khouzami, says he's never witnessed identical triplets in more than three decades at the hospital.\nAccording to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, triplets generally are uncommon, and only about 10 percent of the time are they identical.\nThe identical Hewitt triplets do have some company -- several other sets of identical triplets have been reported in the U.S. this year.\nLast month, Kelli Fenley of Long Island, New York, delivered identical triplet boys weighing in at about 2 pounds each. Another set -- also boys -- was born to a Montana couple in January, and a Pennsylvania family welcomed identical triplet girls in February. Their doctor called the occurrence \"one in a million.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:08:52.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
