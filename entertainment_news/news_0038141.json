During the event which aired live from Milan on Sunday, October 25, he entertained the crowd as well as viewers at home with a live performance of his smash \"What Do You Mean?\". The Canadian heartthrob took the stage in a red T-shirt teamed with matching pants and blue cap. Backed by flashing lights, he busted out some energetic choreography alongside his dancers, who were clad in all-white. Bieber went on to be the biggest winner at this year's MTV EMAs. He took home five awards from categories like Best Male, Best Look and and Best Collaboration for his other recent hit \"Where Are U Now\" featuring Skrillex and Diplo . Ellie Goulding and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis were among those who also performed at the Sunday ceremony. Baring major cleavage and her legs in a black plunging dress featuring thigh-split, the British songbird performed \"Love Me Like You Do\" from the \" Fifty Shades of Grey \" soundtrack and her upcoming \" Delirium \" album. Macklemore and his producer collaborator, meanwhile, took the stage alongside Eric Nally as they opened the festivity with \"Downtown\". The official music video for the hit song won the Best Video title later that night. Other performers highlighting the 2015 MTV EMAs included Andrea Bocelli and Tori Kelly . The opera singer sang his \"Con Te Partiro\" while Kelly played her hit \"Should've Been Us\" before the two teamed up for a duet of Pink 's \"Just Give Me a Reason\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:01:03.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
