Bruno Mars (Bellagio Las Vegas/YouTube) Like Neon Las Vegas on Facebook: By Dave HerreraLas Vegas Review-Journal When Bruno Mars was a kid, he used to emulate Elvis Presley , the mid-’70s Vegas version when The King wore rhinestone-encrusted jumpsuits. Check out the YouTube clips . Mars, the youngest impersonator, was absolutely adorable with his tiny voice. And he had the moves down cold. The pop star probably never imagined back then that his star would eventually rise to the point where his own music would be featured so prominently on the Las Vegas Strip, the very hallowed ground where The King himself used to hold court and where his songs still serve as a soundtrack. Last week, Mars earned his own place in the pantheon next to Presley at Fountains of Bellagio, where \"Uptown Funk,\" his smash single with Mark Ronson, has been added to regular rotation alongside \"Viva Las Vegas.\" The addition of “Uptown Funk” to the iconic water display at the resort follows last fall’s inclusion of “Footprints, Rocky, Red Lights” by dance music superstar Tiesto, one of the only other tracks from this decade to receive such an honor . \"Bruno Mars' music is a perfect fit with Fountains of Bellagio,\" says Randy Morton, president and chief operating office at the Bellagio Resort & Casino, in a short preview clip of the new water display. \"Uptown Funk has quickly become one of the most popular and beloved songs in the world, an instant classic,” adds Morton in a subsequent statement. “Uniting it with our beautiful and iconic dancing Fountains forms a phenomenal partnership that I'm confident will delight guests from around the globe.\" \"I think they should change the name to the 'Brunagio'! That’s what I think,\" says Mars in the video, standing in front of the Fountains of Bellagio. “Never did I ever think that I’d write a song and be in such a location like this. I hope it brings joy to people. Anyone that comes to Vegas.” The shows at Fountains of Bellagio run every half hour from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., and every 15 minutes from 8 p.m. to midnight during the week. On the weekends, meanwhile, the shows run every half hour from noon to 8 p.m., and every 15 minutes from 8 p.m. to midnight. The playlist is made up “Luck Be a Lady” and “Fly Me to the Moon” by Frank Sinatra, “Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson, and “Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds” by the Beatles.
