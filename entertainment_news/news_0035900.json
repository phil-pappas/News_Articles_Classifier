I received a huge number of emails from people who work or worked in the industry, and according to the responses received, I underestimated the damage done by consolidation and by the Dickeys. Here is a sample, with anything incriminating removed to protect identities:\n“Stellar article you wrote, precisely nailing how the Dickey Brothers took down the best radio stations on the planet. Thanks for writing what so many of us have felt for way too long. Goodbye Dickeys and Dickey sycophants. ... Don’t let the screen door hit ya.”\n“Bravo! I have been in radio for 48 years and have never, ever read an article so informative to the professional, the lay reader, and the investor. Nor have I ever read an article about the medium as factual as yours. It’s greatly appreciated.”\n“Your article regarding Cumulus could not be MORE spot on. Back in the ’90s, I earned a degree in television and radio, and had several courses specifically about deregulation and consolidation and how it would impact the industry. Even back in 1992, when deregulation was just around the corner, our professors talked about a world where content was dominated by advertisers and corporations, while they eroded our freedom of speech and journalistic integrity.\n“Those dark days forecasted 20 years ago are here. Corporate interests have sucked all of the fun, true talent and creativity out of radio. Advertisers determine what content hits the air, and that touches all air personalities. Talent has been abandoned and those that remain are the people willing to still work for $8 an hour.”\n“I could not possibly love your story more. After 18 years, I got a snootful of their business model in 2012 in the form of an insulting contract renewal that I was blessed to be able to decline. I have landed in the arms of a competitor, and life could not be better. Many others have not been so lucky. Yours is the best idea — they need to get out of the radio business, which still, for all its modern challenges, is an industry that relies on organic, emotional bonds between personalities and audience, a concept that is Kryptonite to them.”\nAdvertisement\n“I’m not sure where you got your info about Cumulus ... but you nailed it.”\n“I applaud you for exposing this big flop to the public. I can tell you some things that happened to me personally while under the stress of this group. My prayers have been answered. I was so violated and hurt by the powers that be until I still have crying spells and nightmares.”\nThe dissent\nOnly two emails countered my position, and neither actually refuted what I wrote about Cumulus. One was from a competing company and essentially questioned some of the data I spoke of, specifically the downward trend in listening. Related to that was an email that was directed not to me but to my publisher.\n“I am writing to question the level of journalism the Los Angeles Daily News uses regarding its articles. I refer to the 10/6 article entitled ‘Cumulus Media, a dark cloud on the radio industry’ by Richard Wagoner. If this was to be an opinion piece, it should have been clearly labeled as such since there was absolutely no factual information or anything close to that in making the wild accusations made by Mr. Wagoner.” This was written by the president of the Southern California Broadcasters Association, Thom Callahan.\nIn the email, Callahan asserts that outside of Cumulus, every major radio group is experiencing strong stock value and bringing solid returns to its investors. He cites NASDAQ but doesn’t give specifics. In fact, Emmis has lost 66 percent of its value since February 2014 and iHeartMedia dropped more than 50 percent in the past year (and these are just two examples). A stunning amount of debt is being carried by many of these companies and at least two are teetering on bankruptcy.\nHe also stated in the email that radio listening is at an all-time high. Yes, “reach” is at an all-time high. That is the number of people who happen to tune in a radio. But time spent listening to radio has been in a gradual decline according to ratings company Nielsen, and other studies from such companies as Edison Research back that up. The long-term trend is clear.\nRichard Wagoner is a San Pedro freelance writer covering radio in Southern California.
