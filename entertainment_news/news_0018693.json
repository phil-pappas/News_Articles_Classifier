But after only one day in his new home, he was returned to the shelter. Luis is a puppy and like most puppies, he has lots of energy. The adopters didn't follow a structured introduction that might have avoided the situation. Puppies like to use their mouths a lot. It's annoying and they need to be trained not to do this, but no one took the time to work with Luis.\nRescue Me Tampa Shelter Dogs posted an excellent article on their Facebook page about decompressing shelter dogs after adoption. It takes at least a week before dogs (and children) should be allowed around the new dog unsupervised. When introductions are too rushed, bad things can happen. Shelter dogs may need time to get used to a new environment and situation. Luis' mouthing was not acceptable, even though it didn't break the skin (because he wasn't biting, just puppy mouthing). But Luis is a puppy, and he had too much energy and rough play for a young child.\nSo poor Luis was returned to the shelter, and he must be devastated. This eight-month-old puppy is a hound mix. He's really an amazing puppy. He knows many commands (sit, stop, wait, stay, down, no more play, drop it, don't touch it, no, come) and he is house trained. He loves to cuddle and play ball. He adores toys, too. The volunteers just love Luis. According to them, he's a great puppy and very intelligent.\nSo what he needs is a family willing to take the time to work with him and teach him better manners with young children. There are notes on his Facebook thread that he did well in the doggy play group, which means that he gets along with other dogs. He is adorable.\nLuis is heartworm negative. He is ID# A29351411. He is at the Hillsborough County Animal Services, 440 N. Falkenburg Road, Tampa, FL 33619. Their phone number is (813) 744-5660. The shelter is open from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm every day. There is more information on Luis' Facebook thread .\nFollow the Chicago Pets Examiner on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chicago-Pets-Examiner/365410640319755?ref=hl", "https://www.facebook.com/250846728289533/photos/a.897774860263380.1073742504.250846728289533/1088445011196363/?type=3&theater", "http://twitter.com/#%21/pamkramer", "https://www.facebook.com/Rescue-Me-Tampa-Shelter-Dogs-250846728289533/", "https://roanokeadoptablepounddogs.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/decompressing-rescue-dog/"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:55:21.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
