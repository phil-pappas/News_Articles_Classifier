Walker and artist Sanford Greene, according to CosmicBookNews .\nSince 1978, best friends Luke Cage /Power Man and Daniel Rand/Iron Fist have been a two-man crime-fighting agency: providing their services to those who have no place to turn to for help ... as long as they can pay, though. You could say that \"Heroes for Hire\" were somewhat the predecessors to \"The A-Team\": good-guy mercenaries whose real price is justice for the innocent and helpless.\nThe first issue comes out sometime in 2016, which may be coincidental, for Marvel's \"Luke Cage\" will stream on Netflix that same year, where Mike Colter 's titular ex-con uses his superhuman strength and unbreakable skin to fight for the people of Harlem. The character will make his debut on Marvel's \"Jessica Jones\". The series, which premieres on November 20, stars Krysten Ritter as a former superhero turned private investigator in Hell's Kitchen, home of blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) and his alter-ego Daredevil.\nSoon, \"Daredevil\", \"Jessica Jones\", and \"Luke Cage\" will become Marvel's \"Defenders\" alongside the upcoming \"Iron Fist\".", "external_links": ["http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/content/marvel-comics-announces-new-power-man-and-iron-fist-series"], "published": "2015-10-07T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T12:15:09.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
