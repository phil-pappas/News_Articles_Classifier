Nonetheless, Harmon was amused by the inconsistency of the parody's relationship to its source material , and impressed by the appearance of true-blue porn industry veterans.\nm HERSCHEL SAVAGE is in the Community porn and I think he's Pierce but I don't know because everything is awesomely confusing\n— Dan Harmon (@danharmon) October 17, 2015 Pierce Shirley scene.
