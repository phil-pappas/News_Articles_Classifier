One of those actors is Nicolas Cage , who recently admitted that he turned down a role in Peter Jackson's film trilogy \"The Lord of the Rings\". In an interview with Newsweek to promote his new horror film \" Pay the Ghost \", the 51-year-old actor revealed that he was offered a lead role in the action fantasy films. He was eyed to play Aragorn, the role that ended up being played by Viggo Mortensen , but he passed on the part. \"There were different things going on in my life at the time that precluded me from being able to travel and be away from home for three years,\" Cage said. He didn't mention specifically what those different things were, but it seemed like the veteran actor didn't want to leave his family so long to shoot the movies back-to-back for three years in New Zealand. Cage is a very open-minded person as he had a positive point of view over his decision to turn down the role. He was very grateful that he could enjoy the movies without being distracted by himself. \"But the thing is about those movies, I can watch them. I can enjoy them as an audience member. I don't really watch my own movies. And so I genuinely do have the joy of watching these - especially with Lord of the Rings,\" he shared. Cage didn't even regret passing on the role although it might have been one of the biggest roles of his career. \"I don't really have any regrets. I think regret is a waste of time. I try to always move forward as opposed to dwelling on the past or the movies that might have happened,\" he said. \"There certainly were movies that I probably would have benefited from if circumstances in my life allowed me to make them.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:59:16.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
