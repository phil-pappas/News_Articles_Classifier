Giddens was a founder of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a string ensemble that focused on traditional, rural African-American music; she contributed fiddle and banjo, in addition to her remarkable voice. She delivered a star-making solo turn during \"Another Day, Another Time,\" the all-star concert inspired by the Coen brothes film \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\" She joined Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford and Jim James for the T-Bone Burnett-produced \"Lost on the River: the New Basement Tapes\" project, which completed unfinished Bob Dylan songs. Burnett produced Giddens' 2015 solo debut album, \"Tomorrow Is My Turn,\" on which she puts her stamp on songs associated with Dolly Parton, Nina Simone and Patsy Cline, among others. Leyla McCalla is also on the bill with Giddens at Tipitina's.\nAlso on Saturday:\nGeorge Clinton & Parliament-Funkadelic kick out the jams at the House of Blues.\nRight next door, the Electric Six plug in at The Parish.\nRap duo Run the Jewels throws down at Republic New Orleans.\nHarmonica man Johnny Sansone powers his band at Chickie Wah Wah.\nThe Ike Stubblefield Organ Trio is at Snug Harbor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:44:04.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
