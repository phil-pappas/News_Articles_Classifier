There’s no earth-shattering concern that needed to be dealt with, no apocalypse to be postponed. For a geek like me, a light comedy about connectedness (or lack thereof) in today’s world is somewhat below radar. Yet I find “The Intern” delightful; a refreshing break from my usual crop of movies.\nRobert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in ‘The Intern’\nEven without giving away too much, there’s still an awful lot to be said about the different characters in the movie and how they interact. Ben Whittaker (played by Robert De Niro) is a 70-year-old widower and retiree looking to be useful again and connected to the rest of the world. Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), on the other hand, is so busy running an Internet store that she can’t slow down long enough to form a meaningful connection with any of her friends or colleagues.\nIt’s easy to categorize “The Intern” under chick flick. After all, it advances some feminist ideology or other; that women can be successful at both career and family, the whole equality in the workplace idea. Fair enough, those can all be found in the film. But to think that’s all there is to it will be doing the film a disservice.\nThere are also many important issues about men in the film. At one point, Jules laments how men have changed. She asks how in one generation, could men have gone from Robert De Niro’s suit and necktie-wearing dashing figure always ready with a handkerchief, to guys running around in jeans and sweatshirts.\nAnd there is truth in that question. When was the last movie or television show where you have a young man who wanted to be like his dad? Or one that focuses on a relationship between father and son? The only thing which comes to mind is “Quiz Show,” and it was years ago (mental note: must find a copy of that movie for my archives). Another would be – in a more mentor/pupil fashion – “Kingsman.”\nGranted I don’t want every movie that comes out to have such thrust. But, really, Hollywood and the media don’t present many good role models for men these days. On the contrary, we often get dim presentations of fathers (heck, even Odin turned out to be a less than stellar dad).\nA Scene from ‘The Intern’\nThe idea of being a man is different now than what it used to be. It is often used lightly, a greeting as in “Hey, man.” Or it’s avoided altogether because it denotes age or a set of responsibilities today’s young boys don’t want. How many times have characters been called “mister” and he replies, “That’s not me, that’s my dad” or something similar? There’s avoidance to being like our fathers.\nRene Russo with Robert De Niro in ‘The Intern’\nTo be a man often entails making difficult decisions; to be stuffy, rigid, old and behind the times. To be a guy, on the other hand, means to be easy-going; jumping between video games, surfing the net, etc. In other words, the “Peter Pan Syndrome” is more pervasive than ever.\nThis is why the movie struck a chord with me. I love my Dad, and while there are things about him I’d rather not emulate, he has far more traits and mindsets I know would make me a better person if only I embrace them.\nThe challenge for men is to be a hybrid of the new and the old. To grow up enough to be productive, respectable members of society yet retain his sense of fun. A man can be a gentleman and someone who has a respectable job, and still party. Being a man means treating other people, especially the ladies, with respect while able to blow away alien hordes at night.\nYou see that in many of the characters that De Niro influences. They change because of his presence. He’s the Uncle Ben of the office, and as he rubs off some of his wisdom and experience, it’s refreshing to see elderly people portrayed in film this way.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:56:56.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
