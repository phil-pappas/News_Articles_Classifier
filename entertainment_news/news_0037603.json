The Shell Museum invites the community to celebrate this special anniversary. \nOn Saturday, November 14 from 10 am – 5 pm the Museum will host a FREE ADMISSION day due to the generous support of local businesses: The Sanibel-Captiva Rotary Club, Bailey’s General Store, Bank of the Islands, Beach Piez, Brightstreet Group, Jensen’s Marina, The Sanibel-Captiva Trust Company, She Sells Sea Shells, Sanibel Air, Sanibel Sweet Shoppe, Thistle Lodge at Casa Ybel, Trophy Case and Sanibel Plumbing. \nThe day will be filled with family-friendly activities including scavenger hunts, hourly live-tank demonstrations, and arts and crafts projects. Birthday cake by Bailey’s General Store will be served beginning at 11:30 until it runs out! And, each visiting family will receive a special birthday gift to take home (while supplies last). \n“For our birthday we’ve decided to give a gift back to our community – we’re grateful for the support of our many friends who make everything we do possible. Let’s take some time before “season” arrives to celebrate the past and envision the future”– Dorrie Hipschman, Executive Director. \nSatellite parking and shuttle will be available at SCCF.
