Theres even more turbulence for TV anchorwoman Mary Jane Paul (Gabrielle Union) as Season 3 of this addictive drama begins. Shes recovering from a horrific car crash that occurred right after learning that on-again, off-again lover David (Stephen Bishop) and best friend Lisa (Latarsha Rose) have hooked up in the past. Adding salt to the wounds is Mary Janes young and sexy on-air (Daniella Alonso) replacement, who has become an instant sensation while she recovers from the accident. 9 p.m. Tuesday, BET Sweat Inc. is a new reality series that has former The Biggest Loser trainer Jillian Michaels searching for Americas next (unsustainable) fitness craze. Passionate entrepreneurs compete to win $100,000 and a chance to launch their workout concept in gyms across the nation. 10 p.m., SpikeTV Its the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Lets all give thanks that this holiday classic hasnt been rebooted as Its the Great Pumpkin Spice. 8 p.m., ABC The Grinder: Please watch this show. Its funny and deserves a second season. 8:30 p.m., Fox Tiny House Hunters: Hold on, are the houses tiny or the people who hunt them? In todays reality show landscape, thats a legitimate question. 10 p.m., HGTV From Herald news services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:25:28.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
