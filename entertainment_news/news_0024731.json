After it airs, fans will be able to purchase tickets to the film's December 18 movie theater opening. \nTwo, short teasers have been released, but Disney promised an \"exclusive\" look at the new film Monday night. A Spanish-language version of the trailer will air on ESPN Deportes. \nIt's the first movie addition to the Star Wars franchise in a decade. Disney acquired Lucasfilms from Star Wars creator George Lucas for $4 billion in 2012. \nThe company has marketed the new film heavily. \nAhead of the release of \"The Force Awakens,\" Star Wars merchandise, toys and gadgets have flooded stores. California's Disneyland and Florida's Walt Disney World are also getting massive Star Wars attractions. \nSocial media has also been a promotional hub. \"The Force Awakens\" movie poster was released Sunday via Twitter, and it was re-tweeted more than 15,000 times in two hours. \nDisney is looking to profit from Star Wars' cult-like following, and there's more fandom fuel coming. \"The Force Awakens\" is the first installment of a trilogy, and subsequent movie releases are planned for 2017 and 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:43:25.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
