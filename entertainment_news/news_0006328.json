I don't know if it's real or not.\"\nPlay Video CBS Evening News Investigation of Tamir Rice shooting made public A report detailing the investigation of the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice in Cleveland has been released. Police officer Timothy Loehmann shot and...\nBut the police dispatcher never conveyed the caller's uncertainty to the two white officers sent to the scene.\n\"He keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people,\" the dispatcher told the officers.\nActing on that information, the policemen pulled their cruiser right up to Rice, who was black. Less than two seconds later, rookie Officer Timothy Loehmann shot him dead.\nTamir Rice is seen on a security camera holding an air-soft gun in a Cleveland park.\n\"Shots fired. Male down. Black male, maybe 20, black revolver,\" Loehmann said into the police radio. Rice actually was holding an airsoft gun. It looks like a real pistol, but ejects soft plastic, not bullets.\nNow two reports commissioned by the prosecutor have found that it was reasonable for Loehmann to have seen Rice as a threat and respond the way he did. But attorney Walter Madison, who represents the Rice family, said the cops' decision to speed into the park instead of approaching cautiously created a threatening situation where none existed.\nMildretta Warner Davis, Tamir Rice's grandmother, is sill healing almost a year later.\nCBS News \"You can't create the danger and then claim to be fearful of it,\" Madison said. Rice's grandmother Mildretta Warner Davis says the past year has been torture. \"This will never go away. It'll never. I gotta take this to my grave.\"\nThere is no indication when or if the grand jury will return an indictment in this case. The prosecutor said he has commissioned more independent reports on the shooting and will release them when they are finished.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/12/c734dfb2-ea00-4dec-96c2-8214f386ee8d/thumbnail/220x140/161551a5132103b63e8b3bf0ce438b11/rice-reynolds-bulk-oh-hrem61frame23251.jpg", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/12/d2302cf5-4270-4e82-8747-310bbfc5af25/thumbnail/620x350/684d44bf73514380325bcf1b8d07a61d/reynolds-gfx-final-comp-1frame0.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/13/e928e38f-01e4-462c-8511-331ab06fbf65/thumbnail/220x140/86f22c4706e32fef7e279b8b40355b8d/en0613reynoldstamir-2406611640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:11:26.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
