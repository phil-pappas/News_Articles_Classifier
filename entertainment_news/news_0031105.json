He also told police he'd sold $6,000 worth of pot from the apartment at 1785 Bedford Ave. earlier that day.\nHuggins offered to take a lie-detector test, but later backed out.\n\"Given the circumstances, he knows more than he is telling,\" a law enforcement source told the Daily News at the start of the investigation.\nTwo years later, the NYPD says there are still no suspects in the murder. When I called Huggins the other day, he didn't have much to add.\nAny idea who killed your girlfriend? I asked.\n\"I'm not going to go guessing two years after the fact,\" he said.\nStill living in Brooklyn? I asked.\n\"I'd rather not say.\"\nThere was no need for all the secrecy. Ten seconds worth of Internet searching turns up Huggins' Brooklyn address, phone number and a résumé listing work as a driver and production assistant on movies.\nIt was always a great, disappointing mystery to Sargeant's friends and family that she ever took up with Huggins.\nThe daughter of working-class Guyanese immigrants, she was a star from an early age, winning a slot in Prep for Prep, a program that provides scholarships, tutoring and the all-important introductions that enable bright inner-city kids to attend top private schools.\nSargeant ended up at Brearly, one of four black students in a class of 40 at the exclusive all-girls school, and ended up co-head of the student government. She went on to Wesleyan University and excelled yet again.\nPrograms like Prep for Prep and A Better Chance, which celebrates its 45th anniversary this Friday, were created to discover and nurture future black leaders - men and women to provide diversity inside mainstream institutions and new directions within the communities they came from.\nPeople like Tiesha Sargeant.\nShe began living up to her end of the bargain right after college, taking a job as a recruiter for Credit Suisse , scouting out bright college minority students for openings at the Wall Street bank.\nSargeant ended up leaving the bank for a job as a Web designer at Condé Nast , the magazine empire that includes Vanity Fair .\nAnd along the way, trying to strike the right balance between her inner-city roots and elite training, Sargeant wound up with Huggins, a pot dealer going nowhere fast, nibbling on scraps of the entertainment business.\nFriends and family said she seemed deliriously happy and in love.\nDuring this graduation season, when you see smiling youngsters in caps and gowns, heading off to bright futures, wish them good luck - and say a private prayer that they will live as fiercely and fully as Tiesha Sargeant, Brooklyn's bright star taken by the darkness.\nelouis@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:03:54.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
