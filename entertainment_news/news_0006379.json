Jay comes looking a little too good to be true and I think Barry wants to make sure he is on the up and up.\" \n\"At the end of the episode we we're able to create a scenario where we could recreate one of the most famous covers of a Flash comic of all-time: Flash of Two Worlds, \" she reveals. \"So I think that is going to be a really fun moment for fans at the end of the episode. It happens really organically, so if you're not a fan of the comic books you might not notice but if you are you will.\" \nCheck out the video below. \n\nJay Garrick (guest star Teddy Sears), a mysterious man from Earth-2, appears at S.T.A.R.
