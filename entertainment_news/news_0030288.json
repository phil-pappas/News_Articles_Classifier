There will be a reception that evening from 6 to 8 p.m. \nPainting primarily in oil on paper, canvas or panel, Lafage starts with a blank surface and no pre-conceived notions of where he is going. He works to maintain an openness as he applies paint and uses any means possible to work it — scraping, wiping, layering and repeatedly obliterating passages, yet often leaving evidence of the painting’s history and process. \nLafage said that his interest is in searching for the gestalt, as well as arriving at something both specific and universal. His intent is to move what he offers viewers beyond an intellectual response to an image to a more emotional response to a unified experience of material, color, texture, scale and image. \n“Murmur” will remain on view through Nov. 29. Perimeter Gallery is located in Chase’s Daily, 96 Main St. Hours are Tuesdays through Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Sundays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. For more information, call 338-0555. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
