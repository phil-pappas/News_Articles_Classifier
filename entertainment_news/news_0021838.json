Abrahamson said he researched real cases to get a sense of what daily life was like for the victims.\n\"Any life becomes routine when it lasts for long enough,\" he said.\nThe film also explores the media fascination with such cases, and people's desire to know \"the darkest, the dirtiest and nastiest\" details.\n\"That's the terrible dimension of cynicism that does exist in the media and it's driven by public appetite as well,\" Abrahamson said.\n(This version of the story corrects name of production studio to A24 from Weinstein Co in paragraph 4)\n(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:40:34.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
