Addressing a series of election rallies, the Prime Minister today painted Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad as leaders with regressive agenda and with “18th century mindset,” attacking the Bihar Chief Minister over the ‘tantrik’ controversy and said the RJD chief was leading the “Rashtriya Jadu Tona” party. \nKumar yesterday courted controversy as a video of his meeting with a ‘tantrik’ went viral in which the tantrik was heard asking the JD(U) leader why he had teamed up with Prasad. Earlier in the day, Kumar attacked Modi for his alleged failure to deliver on his election promises and said the PM had made “tactical silence” a weapon of choice, which was in stark contrast to his “unmatched theatrics and rhetoric by using unsubstantiated facts.” \n“Modiji was always unmatched in theatrics, rhetoric and using unsubstantiated facts.
