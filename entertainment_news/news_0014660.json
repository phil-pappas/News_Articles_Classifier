He will be missed dearly.\n“Throughout his cricket career he was involved in some extraordinary moments that have become part of the rich history of our great game.” Kline’s greatest moment came in just his second Test, where he became just the sixth Australian to take a hat-trick, dismissing three South African tail-enders in as many balls to claim victory for Australia.\nHe also faced the final ball of the first tied Test in cricket history between Australia and the West Indies in 1960.\nLater in that series, he resiliently defended the final wicket for 109 minutes to deny the West Indies victory in Adelaide. It would be his last act in Test cricket and ultimately allowed Australia to seal the series in the next match.\n“In later years Lindsay was an annual guest at Adelaide and Melbourne Test matches and in many ways those occasions won’t be the same without his great company,” Sutherland added.\n“It has been a very sad year for Australian cricket with the passing of a number of treasured members of our community including Richie Benaud, Arthur Morris and now Lindsay Kline.\n“We extend our deepest sympathies to Lindsay’s wife Stella, family and friends at this sad time.” Kline played 88 first-class matches in total, taking 276 wickets at an average of 27.39.\n Lindsay Kline dies, aged 81", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/lindsay-kline-dies-aged-81/story-e6frf3g3-1227554835227"], "published": "2015-10-03T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:12:13.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
