We're pop culture. Movies are all about the comics, and art and music is all about pop culture,\" Morrison said. \nMorrison said attendees traveled from \"a radius of two to three hours away,\" recalling online ticket sales from purchasers in Ambler, Pa.; Red Bank, N.J., and communities in Delaware and Maryland. \nHomer Abrom said it was his first time at the Geek Fest and the turnout surprised him. \n\"I didn't think we had this many awesome people this close to home,\" the Mount Holly resident said as hundreds filled up the community center and strolled between aisles of vendors hawking vintage comic books, board games, and handmade jewelry. \nAbrom, 27, was dressed head to toe as \"Steampunk Thanos, the overlord of the Marvel Universe and the baddest of the bad.\" His homemade costume featured a purple mask rigged to a vaporizer hidden under his shirt that would appear to emit steam at his command. \n\"Geeks are very passionate about their hobbies,\" he said, saying he enjoys comics, video-games, painting, sculpting and singing and that he recently auditioned for American Idol. \nOutside the community center, Quidditch tournaments were in full swing on a grassy field next to an area where cosplays, a variety of costumed skits, were being staged. Shouts went up when up when a video gamer in a tent nearby scored a victory on a big screen. \n\"Impressive,\" some spectators said, shaking their heads. \nAJ Kirk, 30, a YoYo devotee from New Castle, Del., provided different entertainment. He performed a balancing act by gingerly placing the foot of a six-foot A-frame ladder into the curve of his chin. A crowd clapped and snapped pictures. \nThat day Kirk had planned to challenge a record in the Guiness Book of World Records by similarly balancing a running lawn mower for five minutes. But Morrison had nixed the plan at the last minute, saying his insurer had warned him his premium would triple. \nKirk, who is in charge of YoYo sales at Morrison's board game store, Tiki Tiki in Woodbury, said that he would keep practicing and find a venue that would allow the act at a future date. \nCorrinne Daddario, 23, of Pitman, walked among the throng in her Babadook costume. She said it took her nearly an hour to paint her face to mimic the appearance of the monster in the horror movie The Babadook . It was her second time attending the Geek Fest. \n\"It's a lot of fun and there's lots to see,\" Daddario said, tucking away her sharpened clawlike fingers and revealing a friendlier side. \"It's growing and they are changing it up to add new things.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:16:53.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
