Craig is seen unzipping her dress before the two engage in a steamy make-out session. \nThe Italian actress is the oldest ever 'Bond Girl' but she has insisted on being called a 'Bond Lady' or 'Bond Woman'. \nAfter a few minutes, we see Craig's second Bond Girl LÃ©a Seydoux. Although 007 doesn't get as far as he did with Monica, there's plenty of sexual tension between the two which is visible in the scenes. \nSam Smith beautifully showed love in an action packed film with his soaring falsetto and beautiful dark and brooding video. \nThe Grammy winning singer has already topped the UK charts with his Spectre theme song, Writing's on the Wall. Adele 's Skyfall and Duran Duran's A View To Kill were the first two Bond songs to make it to the top spot on the list. It is also the first James Bond theme song recorded by a British male solo artist since 1965.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:15:11.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
