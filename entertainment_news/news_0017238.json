To combat this, the department embarked on one of its largest drives as part of its target to make safe sex more accessible by spending billions on scented male condoms, female condoms and lubricant.\nA department circular dated June 26 2015, a copy of which City Press has obtained, states that, out of 51 bidders, 13 companies were awarded tenders to supply and deliver the condoms and lubricant between July 1 2015 and June 30 2018.\nThe contracts are for the supply of 3 billion scented male condoms, 54 million female condoms – and, bizarrely, 6 billion sachets of lubricant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:02:39.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
