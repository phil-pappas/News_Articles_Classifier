Photo: Joe Armao \nWhile it wasn't a disaster of Meatloaf proportions, singer Kate Ceberano fluffed the national anthem during the AFL grand final's pre-game show.\nSimilar to what Christina Aguilera did during her rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner at the 2011 Super Bowl, Ceberano was heard singing: \"In history's stage, let every state Advance Australia Fair\" instead of: \"In history's page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair\".\nNot that anyone noticed, at the MCG anyway.\nEver the professional, the Bedroom Eyes singer and Scientologist continued with her otherwise seamless performance.\nAdvertisement 2015 AFL Grand Final at the MCG - Kate Ceberano singing the national anthem. #AFLGF http://t.co/VBU2Ch1uzA \n— 7 News Sydney (@7NewsSydney) October 3, 2015 Prior to the West Coast Eagles and Hawks taking to the ground British pop star Ellie Goulding – commonly referred to as \"the girl who sings the Fifty Shade of Grey song\" – and rockers Bryan Adams and Chris Isaak performed.\nThe sequins on Chris Isaak's suit were louder than the crowd, who were still filtering into the G when he started his set with  Great Balls of Fire , Wicked Game and Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing .\nEllie Goulding's two set performance was slammed on social media after she appeared to miss the cue to her backing track taking more than half a minute to begin singing Love Me Like You Do .\n@elliegoulding that explains her lip synching failure\n— Giancarlo Bonfiglio (@Giancarlo1989) October 3, 2015 What just happened, did they start the backing tape too early? Also: who is this and why? #aflgf \n— Neil McMahon (@NeilMcMahon) October 3, 2015 Pub anthem god Bryan Adams was a welcome reprieve from the sloppy pop tunes opting to sandwich his most popular hit Summer of '69 between Run To You and Can't Stop This Thing We Started .\nMike Brady was once again a stand our performer with even the VIPs like Delta Goodrem shimmying along to Up There Cazaly .\nAir- guitarist @emmasq from @TheAge gets into Bryan Adams as Delta Goodrem kicks back with a brew in the next box. pic.twitter.com/4hMAAlztAT \n— Courtney Walsh (@walshcee) October 3, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:43:59.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
