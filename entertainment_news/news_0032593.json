Related Items Local Real Estate Subscribe Now \nCHRIS Rock is \"so glad\" to be hosting the 2016 Oscars for the second time at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday, February 28. \nThe 50-year-old comedian, who previously presented the prestigious awards ceremony in 2005, can't wait to take on the job for the second time at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday, February 28. \nShortly after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the news, he said: \"I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars. It's great to be back.\" \nThe actor also posted a photograph of himself clutching an Oscar statue on his social media profiles, with the caption: \"Look who is back. #Oscars\" \nChris caused controversy when famously insulted a string of stars, including Jude Law, Colin Farrell and Tobey Maguire, at the event 10 years ago. \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly shortly beforehand, he also dismissed it as nothing more than \"a fashion show.\" \nHe said: \"Come on, it's a fashion show. No one performs; it's not like a music show. What straight black man sits there and watches the Oscars? Show me one.\" \nRumours first began swirling earlier this week that organisers had entered serious talks with the 'Madagascar' star to present the upcoming 88th annual ceremony. \nIn a statement, the show's producers David Hill and Reginald Hudlin said: \"Chris Rock is truly the MVP [Most Valuable Player] of the entertainment industry. Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, documentarian - he's done it all. He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\" \nThe Academy's CEO Dawn Hudson added: \"Chris may be best known as a stand-up comic, but we think of him as a creative innovator in many other ways. He is unafraid in his artistry. We couldn't be happier to welcome him back to the Oscars.\" academy awards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:45:51.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
