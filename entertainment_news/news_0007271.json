The Rev. Steve Markle brought her onstage and asked her the biggest tip she’d ever received. She said about $10. \nThat’s when Markle told her the teaching at the church had been about generosity so the congregation had taken up an offering for the driver. She burst into tears. \nThe Columbus Dispatch reports that the congregation was wrapping up a sermon series on “I was Broke. Now I’m Not.” \nThe church draws about 500 to 600 people each week. \nSound: \n240-a-14-(The Reverend Steve Markle, pastor of Sycamore Creek Church, at October 4 Sunday service)-“is one thousand (applause fades)”-The Reverend Steve Markle, pastor of Sycamore Creek Church, tells the pizza delivery woman that the congregation wants to give her more than a tip.

He also won awards for rap/hip hop album of the year and rap/hip hop song of the year. \nNewcomer Lauren Daigle also took home three awards, including new artist, song of the year and pop/contemporary song of the year for her anthem single, “How Can It Be,” which she also performed during the show, held at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee. \nNATIVITY SCENE FIGHT \nNew Mexico town of Belen in fight to keep Nativity scene \nBELEN, N.M. (AP) — The little New Mexico town of Belen — Spanish for Bethlehem — is fighting to keep a year-round Nativity scene on city property. \nBelen Mayor Jerah Cordova (JEH’-rah CORH’-doh-vah) told The Associated Press the city will resist pressure from a Wisconsin-based group to remove a piece of art on the birth of Jesus. Cordova says the city would even sell the property to keep the Nativity scene up. \nFreedom From Religion Foundation co-president Annie Laurie Gaylor says Belen is violating the U.S. Constitution by having the religious art on city property. She says if Belen puts the property up for sale, her foundation may bid on it and would replace the art with a monument to nonbelievers. \nCordova said those who oppose the Nativity scene are “outsiders” who don’t understand the history and culture of New Mexico — a former Spanish territory with deep Hispanic and spiritual Catholic ties. \nCHURCH KILLING \nParents charged with fatally beating son in New York church \nNEW HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) — Police say a central New York couple has been charged with beating their 19-year-old son to death inside a church, and four fellow church members have been charged with assault. \nThe victim’s 17-year-old brother is hospitalized in serious condition with injuries from an assault. \nThe New Hartford Police Department says 65-year-old Bruce Leonard and 59-year-old Deborah Leonard are charged with first-degree manslaughter in the death of their son Lucas. Police say Lucas Leonard died Monday after he was beaten at Word of Life Church in New Hartford, 80 miles northwest of Albany. \nThe six church members were arraigned Tuesday and sent to Oneida (oh-NY’-duh) County Jail without bail. Bruce Leonard’s lawyer said it was too early to comment on details of the case. Deborah Leonard’s lawyer declined to comment. \nPolice said more arrests are expected as the investigation continues. A possible motive wasn’t disclosed. \nGAY CATHOLIC ADMINISTRATOR FIRED \nMan claims he lost job at Catholic home because he’s gay \nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A Virginia man says Richmond’s Roman Catholic bishop forced his removal from the top job at a diocese-owned assisted living home because he’s gay and married to his partner of 30 years. \nJohn Murphy has filed a discrimination claim against the Diocese of Richmond with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \nMurphy says he served as executive director of the Saint Francis Home in Richmond for about a week before two deputies of Bishop Francis Xavier DiLorenzo told him that he was being fired because his marriage goes against church doctrine. \nMurphy says he was terminated without severance pay and he and his husband, a retired clinical social worker, are relying primarily on Social Security benefits to get by. \nA spokeswoman for the Catholic Diocese of Richmond says she cannot comment on personnel matters. But she says the diocese expects its employees to uphold the church’s teachings, including those consistent with “the sanctity of marriage.” \nCALIFORNIA-ABORTION DISCLOSURE \nPregnancy centers sue to block abortion information law \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Crisis pregnancy centers that encourage women to give birth are suing to block a new law that would make California the first state to require the centers to provide information about abortions. \nThe Sacramento Bee reports that a federal civil rights lawsuit against the California attorney general’s office was filed on behalf of two crisis pregnancy centers that are affiliated with churches. \nThe lawsuit contends the bill signed last week by Gov. Jerry Brown violates the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and religion. It seeks a court injunction to stop the measure from taking effect in January. \nState Attorney General Kamala D. Harris backed the law, and says her office will defend it in court. \nSCHOOL PRAYER \nOpponent of school religion says teacher insults atheists \nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A group seeking to keep public schools religion-free is again objecting to practices in Mississippi’s Rankin County school district. \nThe American Humanist Association says a Northwest Rankin High School teacher who is also a Baptist minister is illegally insulting atheists in class. \nThe association sent a letter to the Rankin County School District Tuesday saying a student and parents are complaining about world history teacher Rick Hammarstrom. The district and Hammarstrom didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. \nThe district is under federal court order to not advance religion during school hours. A student sued in 2013, complaining of a Christian assembly at Northwest Rankin. In July, a federal judge fined the district $7,500 for opening an honors assembly with a Christian prayer and allowing Bible distribution at an elementary school. \nVATICAN-FAMILIES \nVatican seeks to quell talk of letter to pope on family \nVATICAN CITY (AP) — Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi has denounced the leak of a private letter written to Pope Francis by conservative cardinals complaining about the way his big family meeting is being run. But he reminded those responsible that the meeting procedures are set and they’re duty-bound to stick with them. \nAn Italian journalist published the letter Monday and named 13 cardinals who purportedly signed it. Four of those said they never signed it. \nBut the Vatican’s finance manager, Cardinal George Pell, effectively confirmed he was behind the initiative to bring complaints straight to the pope about a perceived lack of openness in the synod that they felt would create “predetermined results.” New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan confirmed that he had signed it. \nThe letter warned that if the synod muddies church teaching about marriage, the Catholic Church risks going the way of “liberal” Protestant churches which, according to the letter, have collapsed because they abandoned “key elements of Christian belief and practice in the name of pastoral adaptation.” \nISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PRAYERS \nIsraeli clerics and ex-president pray for end to violence \nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Former Israeli President Shimon Peres has brought Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders together in Tel Aviv to jointly appeal for peace amid surging violence between Israelis and Palestinians. \nEarlier Tuesday, a pair of stabbing and shooting attacks in Jerusalem killed three Israelis. Some eight Israelis and 27 Palestinians have been killed in a month of Israeli-Palestinian unrest. \nThe religious leaders embraced before they made a united call for peace. Peres said they came together “to pray to the Lord to stop the bloodshed.” \nPeres, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, ended a seven-year term as president last year, but he remains a respected figure who often comments on events in Israel. \nSound: \n205-a-04-(Former Israeli President Shimon Peres (shee-MOHN’ PEHR’-ehs), in meeting with religious leaders)-“respect each other”-Former Israeli President Shimon Peres says Jews, Muslims and Christians should be able to co-exist in peace.

(AP) — The former campus minister at Wichita State University says renovations that included removing pews from a university chapel were sought by Christians, not by Muslims. \nThe university received criticism recently for the chapel renovations, which included replacing pews with folding chairs. Some said they felt the changes marginalized Christians while accommodating Muslims. \nThe Rev. Christopher Eshelman, a United Methodist minister who served as campus minister at Wichita State in 2011 and 2012, told The Wichita Eagle that several people — including him — had the idea to make the chapel a more flexible worship space. \nThe family that made the chapel possible in 1964 specified that it remain open to all creeds and races. \nEshelman says Muslim students made no demands on how the space would be changed. \nNYPD-INTELLIGENCE-NJ \nCourt reinstates lawsuit over NYPD surveillance of Muslims \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal appeals court has reinstated a lawsuit challenging the New York Police Department’s surveillance of Muslim groups in New Jersey after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, saying any resulting harm came from the city’s tactics, not the media’s reporting of them. \nThe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing a judge’s decision last year to dismiss the case, found the Muslim plaintiffs raised sufficient allegations of religious-freedom and equal-protection violations and put the case on track for trial. The court compared the spying to other instances of heightened scrutiny of religious and ethnic groups, including Japanese-Americans during World War II. \nThe lawsuit revived Tuesday was among legal actions that followed reports by the AP that revealed how city police infiltrated Muslim student groups, put informants in mosques and otherwise spied on Muslims as part of a broad effort to prevent terrorist attacks. The reporting was honored with a Pulitzer Prize. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:57:48.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
