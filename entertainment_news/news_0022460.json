How do they deal with water? Will there be a bunch of walkers awaiting them on other ships they may run into? These are all things we don't really have answers to. \"It was important we ended up on the Pacific,\" said showrunner Dave Erickson on a special episode of \"Talking Dead,\" \"The Walking Dead\" after show. \"It opens some interesting options to us.\" Justin Lubin/AMC \"Fear the Walking Dead\" executive producer and showrunner Dave Erickson with actress Alycia Debnam Care on set of \"Fear.\" \nErickson hinted that they're probably not the only ones with the bright idea to head to a boat. \nIf you've been reading the comics, characters have set sail out on the water but we haven't seen any zombies on the ocean or have been taken out to sea — yet! Creator Robert Kirkman hinted in \"The Walking Dead\" comic series we'll be \"seeing some sea travel sooner\" than we think. \nImage/Skybound A scene from issue #139 of \"The Walking Dead.\" \nHowever, the bigger issue is whether Strand is someone who should be trusted. This is a guy who abandoned a bunch of people to rot in some makeshift government holding cells to save his own skin. \n\"No es bueno,\" said Cliff Curtis, who plays Travis on \"Fear the Walking Dead,\" when asked about his first reaction to Strand. \"I don't like the guy. He's great for the show, but he's the antithesis of Travis. He's just got no morality ... I'd take Salazar any day over that guy.\" \n\"I like the suit, though,\" said Curtis, commenting on Strand's very overdressed apocalypse attire. \nJustina Mintz/AMC Strand seems like a man the group should keep a close watch on moving forward. \n\"We will learn much more about Strand in season two,\" added Erickson. \"What was interesting to us was to have a character you don't see very often on 'The Walking Dead' — somebody of means, somebody who has money, a person of affluence. And we see that is his house, that is his boat. He definitely has a con man's charm, which is part of how he accrued his wealth and his fortune, but he's not somebody without his own plans and designs.\" \nDo you think it's a good idea for our survivors to sail away from Los Angeles with Strand on his boat? \n\"Fear the Walking Dead\" will return in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:22:55.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
