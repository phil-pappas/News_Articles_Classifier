David Bowie Set To Release New Album 'Blackstar' In January 2016 David Bowie \nFinally, there's some substance to the rumours doing the rounds over the last few months that Bowie's 25th album is imminent. \nDavid Bowie may recently have confirmed his retirement from the rigours of touring, but that isn’t stopping him from unleashing more music on the world. \nA new report indicates that a new Bowie album, entitled Blackstar , is set for release in the new year. The new record will reportedly be released on January 8th 2016 – Bowie’s 69th birthday – according to a new feature in The Times on Saturday (October 24th). Little was known about the record previously, except that presumably the title track, a snippet of which recently appeared online, would feature, but now some more details have been prised from the secretive artist. Bowie with his wife Iman in 2009 \n“ Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from [Bowie],” the article’s author notes (he’d be hard pushed to make something odder than 1995’s 1.Outside , but we’ll let that slide…). Apparently containing seven tracks over a running length of 45 minutes, the new album was recorded in New York with a group of jazz musicians. \nMore: David Bowie’s agent confirms that the legend has retired from touring \nThe title track, which currently serves as the theme tune to the new Sky Atlantic crime drama ‘The Last Panthers’, will serve as the album’s lead single, out on November 19th. The report says it features “Gregorian chants, a soul section, various electronic beat and bleeps, and Bowie’s distinctive vocals. There is no radio edit; it’s all or nothing.” \nBlackstar will be Bowie’s 25th proper studio album, soundtracks and Tin Machine experiments aside, and follows 2013’s The Next Day . The legendary musician surprised the world back then with the sudden announcement and quick release of his first new material in just under a decade, and it garned some of the very best reviews of Bowie’s career. \nDespite overwhelming demand for all things Bowie, the singer announced that he won’t be touring any new music again. “David is one of the best artists I’ve ever worked with. But every time I see him now, before I even speak to him, he goes, ‘I’m not touring’ and I say, ‘I’m not asking’,” John Giddings, the Isle of Wight Festival’s promoter, told Music Week recently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:07:47.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
