News, Jenner's tour will be called, \"Up Close and Personal,\" although the specific topic of the tour is unclear. Her event, however, is expected to cover how transitioning from Bruce to Caitlyn changed her life.\nHosted by tour company Unique Lives and Experiences, which has led the speaking tours of the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Hillary Clinton , Jenner's first event will reportedly take place in Toronto, Canada on Feb. 22 and continue through four other cities. She will finish her tour in Seattle, Wash. in early March.\nBefore her transition, and after her historic performances in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner took to motivational speaking to share her story as a top athlete and how she got there. TMZ reports in those days, Jenner made about $25,000 per speaking engagement, but since her gender transition, can make more than $100,000 per event.\n Reports: Odom conscious, breathing on his own in Las Vegas hospital Khloe Kardashian responds to Amy Schumer's weight remarks Caitlyn Jenner's mother recovering after breaking both hips", "external_links": ["http://www.eonline.com/news/708569/caitlyn-jenner-going-on-speaking-tour-titled-up-close-and-personal-get-the-details", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://uniquelives.com/caitlyn-jenner", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/06/04/caitlyn-jenner-endorsements-more-money-than-bruce/"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:55:12.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
