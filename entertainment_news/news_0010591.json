Speaking at a panel on integrity in public governance during the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund annual meeting on Sunday, Daniel Kaufmann, president of (NRGI), presented the statistic, result of a study by the NRGI, an independent, non-profit organisation based in New York.

It will also see similar gains in reducing infant mortality and improving education, said Kaufmann. Countries with better control of corruption averaged a five percent improvement in their budget deficits or surplus in the long term, he said. Based on the findings of the study, Kaufmann called for a new definition of corruption. \nBelieving that corruption is no longer a simple transaction between two parties, he called it a “tax on the poor and, increasingly, the middle class… leading to higher levels of inequality”. ”Corruption has shifted to large colluding networks, such as FIFA. These networks shape the rules of the game, institutions, policies and contracts. This is more insidious than petty corruption,” he said. \n  10:54 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:38:45.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
