But life has changed in the 21st century, with alcohol, sex and drugs replacing rock ‘n roll, and conversations of intimacy are punctuated by four letter words. Yale graduate and playwright, Ruby Rae Spiegel, at age 23 is not so far removed from her own high school experience, but not so close to prevent a knowing perspective. Her play,” Dry Land,” underlines the current dangers of the perils of adolescence - and it’s a doozy. The lights come up on a bright, white-tiled locker room, backed by a row of metal lockers, where Amy (Stephanie Recio) orders her new friend, Ester (Eva Hughes), to ”Punch me hard.” The two girls have met as members of their high school swim team and Amy needs help to self-abort her pregnancy. No Dorothy, we are not in Kansas anymore. The play proceeds in short bursts of scenes over 90 minutes (no intermission), a reminder of the early dramas of David Mamet where relationships unfolded in unadorned language and the rawness of the feelings expressed, with little exposition or explanation. Amy and Ester learn to know each other well over the course of several weeks, as Ester becomes her buddy. Along with the difficulties of keeping her mother from discovering her pregnancy, and obtaining the means for the abortion, Amy reaches out for Ester’s emotional support. Amy keeps her supposed best friend, Reba (Alex Lonati) in the dark, perhaps out of shame or wanting to keep her regard. The play explores the complexity of friendships between women and the secrets and lies necessary to maintain a public and private identity. Spiegel adds in the uncertainty of the future for young adults on the brink of lives that could take any sort of direction, to further the problems ahead. One of Spiegel’s gifts as a writer is building characters on stage that ring true, yet gives the actors permission to bring their own talents to the roles – and this cast does not disappoint. Recio turns in an unforgettable performance as Amy, one of those cool girls we all wished to be at age 16, or wanted for a best friend. However, Amy is seething with unrealized ambitions and disappointments that she is trying to hide. Hughes is sympathetic as her foil, the reticent Ester, understanding that she must make her own way in the world and finding the strength to do so. Casting an African-American as Ester, in a play set in a high school in Florida, brings another land-mine to the landscape. Kadahj Bennett, a graduate of the Boston Arts Academy, delivers a poignant portrait of the older guy who meets Ester when she visits his college on a scholarship try-out weekend. Under the cautious but incendiary direction of Steven Bogart, the play builds to a shocking, climatic scene, guaranteed to keep the eyes of the viewer riveted to the stage. Page 2 of 2 - Spiegel’s title, “Dry Land,” suggests the image of a barren terrain that these young people must cross on their way to maturity, in contrast to the cool, calming water of the swimming pool which they have learned to navigate with success. Spiegel has a sure path ahead as a playwright. Boston theater fans can boast that we found her early on, thanks to Company One and this fine production of her first, full-length play.
