(Source: Ron Cohn/The Gorilla Foundation) \n(RNN) - Koko the gorilla, famous for learning American Sign Language and as a symbol for wildlife and gorilla preservation, has adopted two new kittens. \nKoko chose the two kittens from a litter. They are named Ms. Gray and Ms. Black. \nThe Gorilla Foundation posted a video of Koko meeting the kittens and interacting with them. \nThis isn't the first time Koko has had pets. She made headlines in 1984 when she asked for a pet, and researchers gave in, allowing her to pick a kitten from an abandoned litter. Unfortunately, the kitten, named All Ball, managed to escape and was hit and killed by a car. \nAccording to researchers, Koko mourned the death of All Ball. Later in 1985, she picked another kitten, Lips, and then one more, Smoky, when researchers feared another gorilla living with her, Michael, would claim Lips. \nSince then, Koko has interacted with many kittens, which often only come to visit. \nKoko is part of a long-term research project studying non-human communication. She was born July 4, 1971 and has lived most of her life with researcher Penny Patterson, who began caring for Koko when she was about 1 year old. \nAccording to the Gorilla Foundation , Koko has learned to use more than 1,000 signs and understands about 2,000 spoken English words. She can also combine the words she knows to convey new meanings. \nThe foundation also said Koko is not the only gorilla who has learned sign language. Two other gorillas, Michael and Ndume, were part of the research project and learned sign language. Michael passed away in 2000. \nKoko's project is now aiming to study the emotional awareness of gorillas. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
