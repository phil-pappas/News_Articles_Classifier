The $250 ticket included valet parking, open bar, strolling dinner (with chicken florentine pinwheels and carrot kebobs), and seemingly never-ending decadent trays of dessert.\nIt also included an array of custom curated entertainment for Friday night only that featured a 12-piece orchestra playing an original score composed by goth-rock band Bauhaus member David J and orchestra leader Joshua James, a burlesque performance by Roxi D’Lite, fire-breathers (and eaters), and a number of additional sideshow acts.\nThe Theatre Bizarre Preview Gala offered 450 guests a sampling of the 5,000 person Saturday night event at the Masonic Temple on Friday, Oct. 16, 2015.

But unlike tonight’s main event—which encompasses eight floors—only a few were utilized Friday.\nWhile Friday may have come with the perks of complimentary dinner and drinks, tonight’s sold-out event is the bigger and more lavish party. Open to 4,500 people, Theatre Bizarre will kick into full swing with upped production — like a ghost train to shuffle guests around — and a fresh batch of musical entertainment, including 20-some bands and 10 DJs.\nJohn Dunivant, the creative head behind Theatre Bizarre, says attendees can expect one thing: “Danger.”\nTheatre Bizarre\nDoors at 6:30 tonight\n$85 (sold out)\nMasonic Temple, Detroit\ntheatrebizarre.com\nTheatre Bizzare's black tie masquerade gala in Detroit hosted an eclectic mix of curious first timers and Theatre Bizarre veterans in an upscale atmosphere on Friday, Oct. 16, 2015.
