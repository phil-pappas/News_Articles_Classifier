I might want to trust that he (Farhan) has been misdirected.” Abhishek has evidently moved the court to slow down the sequel’s making. He was further cited in the report saying, “right now, we are in court. The script I have composed and the makers are not giving me acknowledgment for it. I simply need credit for my script and I don’t know where is the issue. It takes a ton to compose a motion picture and build up a film and when somebody doesn’t give acknowledgment for that, that is bad. It’s a matter of standards.” Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:25:57.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
