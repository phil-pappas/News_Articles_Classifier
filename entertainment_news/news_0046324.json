(Also Read: Manohar Lal Khattar wants military school at Jhajjar) Stalin participated in the meet taking a break from his pre-election campaign ‘Namakku Name’ (we for ourselves) and Karunanidhi praised him for his work. ”He (Stalin) has done his duty well, irrespective of rain or shine, day or night. I am doing the duty of welcoming him here not only as a father but also as party president ” he said referring to Stalin’s campaign seeking to catapult DMK to power again in next year’s Assembly election. Addressing Stalin formally in Tamil, Karunanidhi said, “He is my son after all, and if I address him formally it may seem like a gap.” ”No one needs to think that there is such a gap and not (try to) use it (gap) by thinking so. It is a little overboard to address him in formal terms, he is my son after all,” he said. ”It is a matter of pride for me that he, who had weathered many storms in the DMK’s saga of sacrifice, participated in this meet,” he added. \n  10:43 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:27:32.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
