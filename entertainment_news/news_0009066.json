The new trailer, more intense and extravagant, glimpses of superbly executed war sequences on a foreign land and the emotional love story set in a village back in India. Another striking element in the new trailer is the film's superb production values which look so grand for a film which is said to be made with a budget of just about 20 crores. Kanche is India's first World War II film and the film promises to be a complete emotional ride filled with authenticity and made with passion by the entire crew.
