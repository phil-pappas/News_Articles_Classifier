A traffic accident, however devastating and heartbreaking when a life is lost, is not necessarily a criminal matter.\" \nAuthorities said Jenner, 65, was towing an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind a Cadillac Escalade when she crashed into two cars, pushing one into oncoming traffic. Driver Kim Howe was killed when her Lexus was hit by a Hummer. \nThe accident occurred as Jenner was becoming a pop culture icon for coming out as a transgender woman. \nSheriff's investigators previously determined that Jenner was traveling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions at the time, and there was enough evidence to support a vehicular manslaughter charge. The case was referred to the district attorney's major crimes division. \nJenner, however, is not entirely off the hook for the accident. She is facing separate lawsuits by Howe's stepchildren and the driver of the other car involved in the collision.
