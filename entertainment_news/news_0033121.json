Now the Man of Steel himself, Henry Cavill , has revealed the prologue that will open the movie which may give idea about how the showdown begins. Cavill tells Total Film that the movie will begin with the Battle of Metropolis that was featured at the end of \" Man of Steel \", but this time, it's shown from the perspective of Wayne. The scene has already been shown in the Comic-Con trailer , in which one of Wayne's buildings begins to crumble and he tries to save the people inside. \"What happens there is one of Bruce's buildings gets destroyed and he's trying to save all the people inside the building and he can't,\" the British actor explains. \"So he is this angry person who fears what Superman may do. Why are they just going to trust this super-powered alien? What if he does decide to turn against us?\" \"He's found himself in a place of harboring a tremendous amount of rage for Superman. So it's how he got there, and what that's done to him, and what that's done to people around him like Alfred, who are, I think, very scared and worried for him. It's something that's interesting and new,\" Cavill adds. The fact that Cavill describes the scenes as a \"prologue\" leads to speculations that the scenes will only be the opening of the film. \"Dawn of Justice\" also stars Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Women, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Amy Adams as Lois Lane and Ray Fisher as Cyborg. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie is due to arrive in the U.S. on March 25, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:06:31.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
