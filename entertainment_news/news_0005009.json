Every member of the Temecula City Council who has given a state of the city address has mentioned it during his or her speech.\nFor the people who live in Wolf Creek and Redhawk it has been an elusory dream, an oasis on the horizon that never materializes.\nCity officials have said it has taken so long to build due to the complications that arise from the use of federal money, which requires extra environmental reports and different types of clearances.\nA few years ago, a new challenge arose when the city started looking at relocating the utilities that would be impacted by construction. This process led the city to purchase the ampm at the corner of Temecula Parkway and Old Town Front Street, which it has been leasing out since 2013.\nWith the ampm land in hand, the city started talking to Caltrans and the various utilities on where and how lines and pipes would be moved. Those talks led to the agreements that were approved this week.\nAttar said the ampm will be demolished in the near future to make way for the relocation of the utilities. That action should serve as the first tangible sign that work on the interchange is ready to begin.\nCecilie Nelson, a real estate agent who lives in Wolf Creek, said the new interchange will do wonders for the entire region, thinning traffic on the residential streets that have been used as Temecula Parkway avoidance routes by locals.\nGarcia and Attar said the next step is requesting permission to bid the project from Caltrans and the Federal Highways Administration, which should be done by the end of the year. Once those agencies sign off, the city can bid the project and construction can begin.\nThe money to pay for the interchange includes more than a million in federal dollars, more than $4 million from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, more than $1 million in county money and millions more from a regional transportation account that is fed by development fees. Officials say it will take about 18 months to build.\nContact the writer: aclaverie@pe.com , 951-368-9698, @PE_Claverie", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc89p-b88540719z.120151016170355000gsqckeq0.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc89p-b88540719z.120151016170355000gsqckeq0.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:35:08.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
