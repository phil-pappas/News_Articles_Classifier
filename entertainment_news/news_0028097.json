The toy manufacturer has taken the consumer market by storm with partners like The Toy Insider , and the new 2015 toy introductions have received 11 awards in 2015 as a consumer-facing company. The choice to also engage with retailers directly has proven very rewarding.\nBetween March – July, Tucker Toys evolved from marketing only through a few international distributors to 45 countries currently with a strong public outreach, engaging kids and families directly. Every toy created by Tucker has received awards from various prestigious organizations including Mom's Choice, Parents' Choice, The National Parenting Center, The Toy Insider and veteran toy marketer Einstein, da Vinci and Goldberg. Most recently, two of Tucker's toys received special needs approval by AblePlay (division of Lekotek), proving the versatility of Tucker's toy innovation that brings value to parents and benefits to children across the spectrum.\nWhile every toy from Tucker's 2015 lineup is award-winning, no one anticipated that two balls, one with more than a decade's global history and one brand-new for 2015, were so exceptional that they found a place among toys unique enough to accommodate children with special needs - an endorsement that was completely unexpected when Tucker's new evolution began. The famous Phlat Ball and E-Z Grip Ball have been donated by Tucker nationally to all of AblePlay's Toy Lending Libraries.\n\"The Phlat Ball and E-Z Grip Ball provide kids with special needs an inclusive experience during play. The balls are enticing to kids of all abilities and there are tons of ways to explore and play! The Lekotek mission is to make the world of play accessible to all children and unite families. Toys like the Phlat Ball and E-Z Grip Ball can help kids reach milestones while having fun!\" – Ahren Hoffman , Manager of Industry Relations & Partnerships\nThe Crush-It! Bat knocked 2015 out of the park, literally. The world's only adjustable-power bat received 5 awards in 3 months, as its racquet-string technology provides unprecedented safety among baseball bats and unparalleled versatility that facilitates social interaction among kids of all ages and skill levels.\nThe Zoingo Boingo Pogo continues to receive more awards with its popularity. The ZB Freestyle Board (spin-off of Zoingo Boingo Pogo) caters to older kids and won the National Parenting Center's Seal of Approval because of its uniqueness and that the toy testers would not stop playing with it!\nWith so much positive feedback from the public, Tucker Toys has been paying it forward through donations to youth camps and community organizations all over the U.S., Canada and the UK. Publications are featuring Tucker Toys in their repertoires of toys recommended for healthy, active families.\nMedia Contact:\nCamille Forte\nTucker International, LLC\n(856) 216-1333\nhttp://www.tuckertoys.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tucker-toys-wins-11-awards---adds-direct-retailer-and-consumer-business-model-300152866.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
