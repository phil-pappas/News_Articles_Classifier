They lost 8-2.\nAnd if you weren't at the rink, please know this: The score was VERY indicative of the game.\nThis was ugly. \"Disjointed\" is how Amerks coach Randy Cunneyworth described his team.\nThat's accurate, for sure. There were perhaps 10 players in the lineup that will be seen again on opening night (Oct. 9 against the Lake Erie Monsters). Others were hoping to show they belong in the AHL now, or are worthy of mid-season recalls when injuries strike.\nBinghamton outshot the Amerks 39-25, including 29-13 over the final two periods. They gave up a boatload of prime scoring chances, they allowed the Senators to gain position the deep slot and they generated few chances of their own.\nOf course, it was the preseason, this group had never played together, and a good many veterans had little to accomplish besides not getting hurt.\nDan Catenacci was unable to accomplish that, however. Slowed by a pulled groin muscle this week (he didn't practice on Wednesday), he aggravated the injury in the first period and didn't play the final two periods.\nCunneyworth did have one big complaint with his team: There was a significant lack of communication.\nDuring training camp with the Buffalo Sabres, on-ice chatter was a point of emphasis. If you're out there, you better be talking. Goalies, defensemen, wingers, whoever. Let your teammates know where you are, let your teammates know where the opponent is headed.\nOn Thursday, there was more noise in the boarded up gas station on Jefferson Road across from the RIT campus than there was on the ice of the Polisseni Center.\nAs Cunneyworth pointed out, a whole lot of the players in the lineup were in Buffalo's camp, so they should have known that communication was expected.\n* * * * * * *\nBuy Photo Former RIT star Matt Garbowsky played in eight games with the Amerks in April on a tryout.

Welcome home.\n\"I don't know if they asked where I was or what, but they did set me up there,\" Garbowsky said.\nAs for putting on the Amerks sweater in the RIT room?\n\"Obviously it's different being in our dressing room and not seeing the normal guys,\" he said.\n* * * * * * *\nColin Jacobs and Jason Bailey scored the Amerks goals. Rookie Tobias Lindberg and Ryan Penny each scored a pair for the Senators.\n* * * * * * *\nWhat's in a number?\nA really strong hint, perhaps.\nSpencerport's Shane Prince wore No. 18 for Binghamton the past three seasons but on Thursday it was worn by Chris Rumble.\nThat is a very good sign that Prince has earned a job with the NHL's Ottawa Senators.\n* * * * * * *\nThe Amerks play their final preseason game at Binghamton at 7 p.m. Saturday.\nAt the same time, former Amerks scoring star Craig Fisher will be at RIT. He coaches the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. The school is in town to play the Tigers in a 7 p.m. exhibition game at the Polisseni Center.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792273221033520-garbo-action-pic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03b49b1e238637741dbaaac5397c939f28e54613/c=0-176-2996-1869&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Rochester/Rochester/635792273221033520-garbo-action-pic.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:13:09.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
