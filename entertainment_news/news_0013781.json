(Anthony Devlin/PA) \nMr Justice Flaux had described Andre, 42, as “an extremely unsatisfactory witness” in a ruling on the case. He said on some issues Andre’s evidence was “not truthful”. \nThe Strictly Come Dancing star insisted that he had told the truth. \nThe legal battle had been over an ITV2 production agreement for shows involving both Andre and singer turned reality TV star Kerry Katona. (Hannah McKay/PA) \nThe Andre agreement had been for three years and related to the Peter Andre: The Next Chapter series and Here To Help. The series initially concerned his marriage to the model Katie Price and then his life in the aftermath of their divorce. \nMr H TV claimed that ITV had wrongfully terminated the production agreement and claimed damages estimated to be between £6 million and £7 million. ITV2 disputed the claim. Share article \nSources estimated that ITV2 could be left with lawyers’ bills of more than £10 million.
