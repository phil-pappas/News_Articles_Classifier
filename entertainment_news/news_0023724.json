But Hof has stood firm in his right to publicly defend his business, a brothel operating under Nevada law. \n\"My business is built on privacy and discretion,\" he reiterated on Saturday to CNN's Michael Smerconish. \"But when the ambulance pulls out and five minutes later TMZ calls me, you have to deal with it.\" \nTo really understand Hof's behavior is to believe, like he does, that legal prostitution is a business that should not operate in the shadows -- a position Hof has long advocated in the media, in his recent memoir, and on the HBO series \"Cathouse,\" which documents goings-on in another brothel owned by Hof, the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel in Mound House, Nevada. \nIt's more than a moral position for Hof -- it's a business strategy. \nBut what about the \"hooker code\" of discretion? Smerconish pressed. Didn't Hof have an obligation to Odom to keep his mouth shut, to even conceal Odom's reason for being there? \nMaybe in the world of illegal prostitution, \"but I don't know anything about that,\" Hof replied. \n\"It's not any secret that he was at the brothel. It's my job to protect my business and Lamar's reputation,\" he said. \n\"We're not gonna sit back and let people throw rocks at us just because it's a hooker,\" he said. \"These hookers are all making huge incomes and most of them have better educations than I do. They're professional working girls.\" \n'I wanted the girls to be independent' \nIt's standard Hof -- sex, money and self-promotion -- to anyone familiar with the HBO show or his appearances on syndicated radio or TV specials on the debate over legalized prostitution (including the 2011 CNN special, \"Selling the Girl Next Door\"). As journalist Rebecca Mead noted in \"American Pimp,\" her 2001 New Yorker profile, \"Hof exhibits the marketing man's conviction that promotion will eventually be followed by product.\" \nWhen describing his growing empire -- he owns seven of Nevada's 18 brothels -- he's fond of saying he and his \"girls\" are not just selling sex, they're selling \"the adventure.\" \nA series of outlandish stunts underscore his flair for courting controversy as self-promotion, such as the time he offered free services at his brothels to returning servicemen, or when he hired John Wayne Bobbitt to work as a driver, or the time he promoted a \"Get My Grandpa Laid\" contest on the \"Howard Stern Show.\" \nIn July, he made national headlines when he announced he was setting up an exploratory committee to look at a U.S. Senate run as a Libertarian. \nAlong the way, he befriended Hustler pornographer Larry Flynt, former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss and porn star Ron Jeremy, all of whom served as advisers in building his brothel empire. \nHe has used his platform to speak out against sex trafficking and advocate for legalized prostitution, arguing that it's not only good for women in the trade but good for business. \nHof laid bare his motives in the 2015 memoir, \"Art of the Pimp,\" which recounts his rise from gas station owner to real estate broker to brothel baron. \nWhen Hof took over Nevada's oldest brothel, the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, in 1992, he applied his business savvy to prostitution, by turning the brothel into a \"destination.\" \n\"Over the years, I had created some of the best sales teams in the country. If I could teach a high-school dropout how to sell a time-share, surely I could teach a hooker how to sell herself,\" he wrote in his memoir. \"I wanted the girls to be independent, to set their own prices and make their own deals.\" \nHe changed the name to Dennis Hof's World Famous Moonlite BunnyRanch and made the prostitutes independent contractors with the right to refuse any act or customer. He brought in financial advisers to teach the women about personal investing, sales and negotiations. In exchange, the women split their earnings with the house, paid for their own healthcare services, sex toys and living expenses. \n\"Every girl has their limits, and I want a willing buyer and a willing seller,\" he told iHeartRadio host Nikki Sixx in March. \"When you change things that drastically everyone thought he's a square, this is never gonna work. And, now, I own all my competition.\" \nThe other side of fame: 'Creepy and vile' \nHof was born in Phoenix in 1946. When his grandfather died, his mother told him to take a \"little memento,\" from his grandfather's room, Hof wrote in his memoir. He chose Dale Carnegie's book, \"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,\" and it left an impression on him. Growing up he worked at a gas station and saw a business opportunity. He bought his first gas station in Phoenix and by 1971 he was running five. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:15:24.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
