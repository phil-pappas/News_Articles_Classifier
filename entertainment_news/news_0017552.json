The holdout, which lasted about three weeks, ended on Wednesday when Thompson agreed to a five-year, $82 million contract, and now the beat-up Cavs will have one of their key players available for the start of the season.\nHow much did Thompson prosper? Almost a year ago, at the start of the 2014-15 season, Thompson declined a four-year, $52 million extension. It wasn’t always easy getting there, but Thompson made the right deal.\nAt one point early in free agency in July, the two sides were close to an agreement on a five-year, $80 million deal, ESPN reported, but as free agency progressed, Thompson’s side began pushing for a max deal or near-max deal higher than $90 million.\nThe Cavs resisted, unwilling to pay that much for a back-up forward, albeit a talented one who was a valuable contributor to Cleveland’s postseason push to the NBA Finals last season.\nThompson could’ve signed the qualifying offer – a one-year deal worth $6.7 million – and become an unrestricted free agent after 2015-16. But he let the deadline to sign the offer pass in early October.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Is Eastern Conference the Cavaliers' to lose?\nDespite some initial pain, the deal works for both sides, though Cleveland’s finance department will be writing a significant luxury tax check to the league after next season. Sometimes, that is the cost of pursuing a championship, and Cleveland realized that pursuit is worth the money spent on Thompson. Besides, his deal is just $2 million more than Cleveland wanted to go and less than the max Thompson sought.\nAt less than the max, the deal still gives the Cavs some flexibility, especially at the end of Thompson’s deal, as the salary cap increases and when his looks reasonable compared to other contracts. It also gives the Cavs the ability to move Thompson to a team that knows they would have him for few years.\nIt is a significant commitment by Cavs ownership, led by Dan Gilbert. Cleveland will have a payroll, including luxury taxes, that surpasses $170 million.\nUSA TODAY\nCleveland Cavaliers preview: The only goal is a championship\nFor Thompson, who will make $14.2 million this season, it’s a stellar deal – all money is guaranteed – proving a player’s highest value is sometimes with his most recent team. During free agency, when Thompson was a restricted free agent, another team could have made an offer. That didn’t happen.\nCleveland needs Thompson, and Thompson needs Cleveland.\nNow, he is one of the highest paid power forwards in the NBA, and the Cavs have significant money tied up power forwards, Kevin Love included.\nThompson averaged 8.5 points and eight rebounds, including 3.3 offensive rebounds, last season, and during the playoffs, he averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds, helping mitigate the loss of Love to a season-ending shoulder injury in the first round of the playoffs.\nThe contract negotiations had compelling background drama, too. Both sides had holdout history, and Thompson’s agent, Rich Paul, is also LeBron James’ agent.\nUltimately, both sides resolved the issue before it turned into a bigger problem. Now, that distraction is over, and they can put all their focus into winning a championship.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/cavaliers/2015/10/21/cavaliers-lebron-james-kyrie-irving-kevin-love-mo-williams-david-blatt/31062013/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf7c341f17af8109f9042c734fb59dd19fdfff6d/c=657-0-3489-2832/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809382757442213-sw27-eastern-1012.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2015/09/21/nba-z-podcast-eastern-conference-preview-cavaliers-bulls-wizards-bucks-heat/72559614/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1022470c07f88b99d0b47c212e506708b9885c0d/c=0-158-2227-2385/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784294286411224-AP-Cavaliers-Bulls-Basketball.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:42:43.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
