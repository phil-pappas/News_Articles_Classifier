Well, that is, if you saw the last installment of the hit film franchise “The Fast And The Furious” on his guesting on “Eat Bulaga” last Saturday.\nYes, Charlie is featured in the “Furious 7” theme tune, Whiz Khalifa’s “See You Again,” that to date has earned more than a billion clicks on YouTube.\nIf that doesn’t establish the 25-year-old as a breakout artist of 2015 then his recently released debut EP “Some Type Of Love” just might do it.\nAlready, the Berklee College of Music alumni scored another bonafide hit in “Marvin Gaye,” which features Meghan Trainor.\nPuth wears his influences well. In his best Otis Redding and Sam Cooke approximation, he manages to pass off as a soul singer with “I Won’t Tell A Soul.” The same goes for the slightly more poppy “Some Type Of Love.”\nIf there’s any doubt as to what type of music Puth is betting his chips on, the rhythm and blues-hued track “Suffer” should end any more speculation. It’s like the guy wants the sound that made stars out of heroes cool again. Hey, come to think of it, he might have signed with Atlantic for the same reason. The label, after all, made big stars of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, among others.\nWhatever the case may be, it’s not a bad proposition. Charlie is sure to make a big mark, and soon.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:38:44.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
