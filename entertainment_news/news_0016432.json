The seven-member jury at this year's event was led by American director Darren Aronofsky. \nThere was no immediate word on who will serve alongside Streep on the 2016 jury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:19:31.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
