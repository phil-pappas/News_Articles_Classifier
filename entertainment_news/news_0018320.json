I hereby retire from all forms of international cricket and from the Indian Premier League (IPL),” Sehwag tweeted, also attaching a printed statement on his retirement. (Read:I never picked up a cricket bat after my last ODI: Ravindra Jadeja ) \nOne of India’s greatest opening batsmen, Sehwag on Monday clearly indicated that he will “soon” retire. That “soon” came just a day later when the dashing opening batsman turned 37. \nHowever, the Delhi-born will play in the Masters Champions League (MCL), which he launched in Dubai on Monday with other stars like Brian Lara, Graeme Smith, Michael Vaughan — a tournament to be held early next year for retired cricketers. \nSehwag last represented India in the Test series against Australia in March 2013 and his spot was subsequently filled by the likes of Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay following a string of low scores. \nA few says back, Sehwag switched his allegiance from Delhi to Haryana in the Ranji Trophy. The swashbuckling right-hander represented Delhi for 18 seasons since 1997-98 but after several poor seasons, that saw him getting dropped from the national team, he decided to make the switch. \nIn a career spanning over 15 years in international cricket, Sehwag featured in 104 Tests and scored 8,586 runs at a staggering average of 49.34. In 251 One-Day Internationals (ODI), he amassed 8,273 runs at an average of 35.05. \nIt was in Tests that Sehwag went on to establish himself as one of the very best in the game. He is still the only Indian willower to have a triple century in his name, having done so twice against Pakistan (309 in Multan) and South Africa (319 in Chennai). This made him the only batsman along with Don Bradman, Chris Gayle and Brian Lara who have scored a triple century twice in Test matches. His batting was also instrumental in helping India win the 2011 World Cup at home. \n\n  3:59 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:10:43.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
