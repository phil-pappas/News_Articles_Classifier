One the most twisted and talented is the one we call Teen LaQuifa, as evidenced by this Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump piece of graphic satire. \nI've been friends with Teen on social media for the past few years and he's always up to no good. In other words, he's quick witted, handy with photoshop and fun to follow. \nTeen is also a frequent flier on the AL.com cartoon caption contests. \nI'm jealous of this Lady and the Trump offering. Wish I had thought of it first. \nNice work, Mr. Laquifa. \nY'all go ahead and follow Teen LaQuifa on Facebook. Pretty sure he's the only one with that name. \nGot game? Bring it on. \nCheck out more cartoons and stuff by JD Crowe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:01:19.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
