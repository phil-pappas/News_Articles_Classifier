Do you get tired of answering questions about having no arms and legs?\nA. That doesn't annoy me ... it's always about understanding that no matter what questions are asked, it's not about so someone can gain knowledge. It's about someone gaining perspective. Perspective really helps you in the breadth and depth of your maturity, which is exactly how you respond with different challenges.\nQ. Did you know what you wanted to be when you grew up?\nA. Obviously I did not want to be a runner. I did not want to be a policeman. I wouldn't be a fireman. And I didn't know, though, what I would be. It was very, very difficult to feel like everyone else sort of knew that they wanted to be ... a doctor or a lawyer ... I just wanted to be happy. A life without purpose is a life without meaning, and a life without meaning is a life without hope. If there is no meaning to our life and our existence, even the fact that beautiful things can come from your broken pieces when you give your broken pieces a chance, you don't see the joy that you can have in your life. Realizing that every day is a gift, and your value is not determined on what job you get, what title you have, what money you have, if you get married or not, if you have kids or not, it's got nothing to do with that. It's about understanding that you have to be the best that you can be, and that's what matters the most. For me it's my faith in God that helps me understand that heaven is real ... and if I can be a miracle for somebody, even when God doesn't give me arms and legs.\nQ. Do you still ask God for arms and legs?\nA. I don't remember the last time I prayed for arms and legs, but I know that when I am in heaven, I will have my arms and legs, and I know that I will be hugging a couple of people in heaven who will be saying, 'Nick, thank you for coming to my school or country and helping me believe that there was something more in my life and heaven is real.' That's the greatest thing of all.\nQ. Is hugging people the thing that you miss the most?\nA. If I had arms right now, I would wrap my arms around my wife, pick her up and throw her into the closest pool for fun. Obviously, I can't hold my wife's hand, but I don't need to hold her hand, I just need to hold her heart. You don't need hands to hug people.\nQ. Concerning your physical disability, what were your student days like?\nA. A lot of bullying went on, but I still enjoyed life. I went through a depression and even suicide thoughts from ages 8-12. The thoughts during that time were: I didn't want to be ridiculed, and/or feel like an outcast or be a liability/burden to someone. Also, the simple pleasures of normal life seemed difficult, I didn't see myself having a bright future at that time.\nQ. What is your advice to people with similar disabilities?\nA. Anyone with any sort of disability must know that they are loved by God, and that He sees them and knows their needs. I hope to encourage adults and children that God does not give us more than we can handle. Our hope isn't on this earth but knowing that those who believe will go to hope, HEAVEN. In the meantime, if He doesn't change a circumstance, your heart can be changed to a point that you'll see one day, I believe even good purpose brought forward.\nQ. What are some of the things you can do that most people wouldn't expect?\nA. I can open a can of coke with my teeth.\nQ. What have been some of the most difficult struggles you have faced?\nA. Accepting things I cannot change; Thinking I can change some things without God.\nFor more answers to frequently asked questions about Vujicic, visit lifewithoutlimbs.org.\nRelated Article\nEvangelist brings down house at Judson University News Nation/World Religion Judson University", "external_links": ["http://www.lifewithoutlimbs.org/about-nick/faq/", "https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-13T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:00:42.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
