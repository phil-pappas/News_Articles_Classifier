In fact, time travel is a well-trodden area in sci-fi and will continue to be for many years to come. Here's our ten favourite time travel films that AREN'T Back To The Future.\n10. FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR (1986)\nIt's been mooted for a remake for quite some time, but this overlooked classic really does shine to this day. A young boy mysteriously time-jumps ahead, but remains the same age and, somehow, now knows how to fly an alien spacecraft. Starring then-unknowns Sarah Jessica Parker and Paul Reubens as the voice of Max, Flight of the Navigator was the kind of film you'd expect JJ Abrams or Colin Trevorrow to make nowadays. In fact, Trevorrow was slated to direct the remake some time ago. We're guessing he's too busy with Star Wars: Episode IX now.\n9. PRIMER (2004)\nA film so dense, so numbing and complex that it requires a flow-chart to understand it, Primer is an apt example of just how deep time travel can get. Made for a paltry $7,000, the film began a cult hit for its unique take on the topic. Shane Curruth, who wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, holds a degree in mathmatics and was an engineer prior to making the film - and it shows. The film takes in the philosophical implications of time travel, choosing not to give any easy answers or outright implications. It's a fascinating watch.\n8. LOOPER (2012)\nAlthough it's more known for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's dodgy makeup to resemble Bruce Willis, Looper was inventive in how it took time travel to its logical conclusion. Of course it would be outlawed and of course crime syndicates would use it for their own end. What's also really cool is how the Loopers themselves have that same sort of fatalism we see in stereotypical youth on screen. They don't care if they shoot themselves in the future, they're too busy enjoying life now to care. Featuring a fantastic performance by Levitt and one of the few remaining films this decade we can take Willis seriously, Looper's a smartly-made, classy sci-fi actioner.\n7. STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME (1986)\nTrivia time! Eddie Murphy was very, very close to starring in The Voyage Home. As an avid and lifelong fan, Murphy was originally slated to star as the whale biologist played by Catherine Hicks. However, Murphy was unhappy with the role and opted to make The Golden Child instead, a decision he later regretted. Still, The Voyage Home is one of the better Star Trek films because it taps into that great, fish-out-of-water comedy that director Leonard Nimoy does so well. He did, after all, make Three Men And A Baby, arguably one of the best comedies of the '80s.\n6. SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980)\nWritten by sci-fi legend Richard Matheson and based on his novella, Somewhere In Time is a beautifully-made romance about a writer played by Superman's Christopher Reeve who, through self-hypnosis (really?), manages to travel back to 1912 to meet Jane Seymour. A romance flourishes between the two, however Seymour is being managed and coralled by Christopher Plummer. It's a bit schmaltzy, sure, but there's one particular scene that is both haunting and beautiful; Jane Seymour talks about finding love in the most unexpected place. If it doesn't make you choke up a bit, you're a robot.\n5. DONNIE DARKO (2001)\nMixing teenage angst, a cracking soundtrack and heady sci-fi philosophy, Donnie Darko was one of the films of 2001. A star-making role for Jake Gyllenhaal, Donnie Darko featured a talking rabbit, tangent universes, Living Receivers, Patrick Swayze as a cult leader, Echo And The Bunnymen and one of the best continuous scenes we've seen in years. It's such a shame that director Richard Kelly never managed to enjoy the same level of success with other efforts like The Box and Southland Tales, as both films truly are overlooked.\n4. SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE (1972)\nBased on Kurt Vonnegut's novel of the same name, Slaughterhouse-Five deals with a man who is \"unstuck in time\", as he describes. Living his life out of a linear order, he experiences World War II as a prisoner of war and during the notorious bombing of Dresden, through to family life and, bizarrely, life on the alien planet Tralfamadore. Vonnegut's bizarre satire is perfectly captured here by master filmmaker George Roy Hill, who worked on the Robert Redford / Paul Newman classics Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid and The Sting.\n3. EDGE OF TOMORROW (2014)\nHow this film was passed over by audiences remains a mystery to this day. A mixture of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers with Groundhog Day shouldn't work, yet somehow, it absolutely did. Based on the novel by Hiroshi Sakazura, he got the idea from playing videogames and how, each time, he was landed back at the start. Such a simple idea, really, and yet it works so well. Tom Cruise works perfectly as the sheepish, sleazy PR agent who's dropped into the middle of a D-Day style invasion of Europe and inexplicably gains the ability to relive the same day over and over again. Guiding him through the process is Full Metal Bitch Emily Blunt, who had the same power, but ended up losing it. Again, it's bonkers when you say it out loud - but it works so well.\n2. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1990)\nIt really does speak to Terminator's place in sci-fi that, when speaking about time travel, it's either Back To The Future rules or Terminator rules. Anyone remember that South Park episode with the Goobacks? Exactly.\n1. GROUNDHOG DAY (1993)\nIt might be an obvious choice, but Groundhog Day is one of those films that stands the test of time. Twenty-two years on, it's still as fresh, inventive, heartwarming and funny as ever. Murray, in a career-best performance, marvels as Phil Conners, the self-centred weatherman who is doomed to repeat February 2nd over and over again until he can win the heart of producer Andie MacDowell. Easily Harold Ramis' greatest work, Groundhog Day offers an insight into what exactly happens when you're forced into the same routine, over and over again.\nHONOURABLE MENTIONS\nSafety Not Guaranteed (2012)\nTimecop (1994)\nAbout Time (2013)\nThe Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006)\nBill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1992)\nMORE: Star Wars Episode IX has its director\nMORE: Ten movies you need to see before the end of 2015\nMORE: Marvel says Avengers: Infinity War will be the end of 'The Avengers as we know them'", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VF5P7qLaEQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTxRveph1Ys", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CC60HJvZRE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxgLwrW9h_A", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltfwZRcd-aE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1cq34UeUmM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXJq5LJH6nk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZH3OD9d9Sc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvlZtlBfCi0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_eUyo8aWTQ"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:30:50.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
