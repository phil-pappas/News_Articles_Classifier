It is just that my films took a long time to fall into place. I am a student of literature and I have read Hamlet and it is a fascinating tale,\" Onir told PTI.\nThe director feels there is nothing wrong in getting inspired by Shakespeare's works and cited that Romeo and Juliet is the most frequently adapted story of the writer in Bollywood, and people still throng in theatres to watch such movies.\n\"Why not 'Hamlet'? There are so many films in Bollywood which have been made on Romeo and Juliet. In the recent past there were films like \"Ishaqzaade\", \"Ram Leela\" and \"Issaq\" based on the tragic love story.\"\nThe first schedule of the movie, starring newcomers, has been shot in the UK and Onir will begin work on the second in Jaisalmer this December.\nThe director said Hamlet may not be a very popular story, but he is confident that \"Veda\" will find its audience.\n\"Not a lot of people know about 'Hamlet'. But I think when they come to watch a film, they take note of the story.\nMy film has a good chance,\" he said.\nBesides \"Veda\", Onir has two other releases lined for next year- \"Shab\" and his production venture \"Chauranga\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:45:58.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
