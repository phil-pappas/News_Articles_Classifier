After the Canadian singer jokingly threw shade at the British group over their decision to drop their new album on the same day he's releasing his, band member Louis Tomlinson appeared to give his response in one of a few Snapchat videos taken during their latest London concert. As previously reported, Bieber seemed to diss One Direction when he shared a Snapchat video showing him saying in front of the camera, \"The face you make when you come out with an album the same day as Justin Bieber,\" before making a scared face. Just a day later, Tomlinson shared his own video featuring him saying, \"That face you pull when you're playing the last night at the O2.\" He then makes a shocked face similar to the one Bieber made. — 1D's Snapchats (@1DSnapcht) September 30, 2015 On Wednesday, September 30, One Direction played the last of their six-night show at London's O2 Arena, which is one of the world's most famous venues. After Tomlinson's clip made rounds on the internet, many fans implied that he's bragging about One Direction's success while poking fun at the fact that Bieber hasn't toured in years. One Direction's \" Made in the A.M. \" and Bieber's comeback LP are both scheduled to hit the stores on November 13. \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:24:39.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
