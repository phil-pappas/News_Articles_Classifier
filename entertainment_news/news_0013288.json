All this from white Brooklyn kids in the late 1950s. Did segregation come into play? \"Not at all,\" recalls Sedaka, 76, in a phone interview. Then he shifts to a different question. \"I used to go in as a teenager. I took the subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan and played for Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records, hoping they would not only take the song, but to sign me as a singer. But they didn't.\n\"But yes,\" he said by phone from his New York home, \"I have a lot of recordings -- Cardinals, Clovers, Cookies. I love R&B. There's a correlation between Yiddish music and R&B. You're in the minor key, and they're lamentful, and they show we have been suppressed, and we have been segregated over the years. I do find there is a closeness.\"\nSo in a one-minute exchange, Sedaka, the longtime songwriter responsible for \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,\" \"Love Will Keep Us Together,\" \"Laughter In the Rain\" and dozens of songs by artists from Frank Sinatra to Elvis Presley to the Monkees, sums up the connection between Jewish songwriters and African-American performers in the early rock 'n' roll era and how they came together at independent record labels such as Atlantic.\nSedaka indulges in several questions about his massive songbook. \"I think it's 700 to 800 (songs),\" he says. \"Don't ask me to name them all. It's more than 60 years of writing. I would say a couple of hundred have been released in one form or another.\"\nBut he emphasizes that he's a singer too, and a classical composer, as his early biography suggests. His mother, Eleanor, worked a part-time department-store job to pay for his first piano, and by the time he was 18 he was on a piano scholarship at New York's Julliard School of Music. A few years earlier he had hooked up with a neighbor, 16-year-old poet Howard Greenfield, and the two teenagers began collaborating on songs; soon they were writing together in a room in the Brill Building, 1650 Broadway in New York.\nBy 1959, after scoring hits for other people, Sedaka managed to carve one out for himself -- \"Oh! Carol,\" named for fellow Brill Building songwriter Carole King. The song led to \"Stairway to Heaven,\" \"You Mean Everything to Me\" and others, and Sedaka found himself touring all over the world. \"I'm not a shouter,\" he says. \"My style is softer, and I think I've been overlooked -- I've been underestimated as a singer.\"\nThrough 1963, Sedaka and Greenfield sold 40 million records, until The Beatles showed up to change music from crooners to rock 'n' roll groups in the U.S. Although Sedaka continued to make a living, scoring hits by the 5th Dimension and Tom Jones, he didn't take off again until the '70s, when The Carpenters covered his \"Solitaire\" and Captain and Tennille took \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" to No. 1.\n\"'Love Will Keep Us Together' is a combination of Diana Ross, the Beach Boys and Al Green,\" Sedaka said. \"I used to love the timbre of Diana Ross' voice and the Beach Boys' feel and the augmented chords of Al Green. I put all of those (together) and mixed them in a pot.\"\nSoon, Sedaka was a go-to songwriter for stars from John Travolta to Wayne Newton for years, and headlined Las Vegas showrooms, which led to many years of touring U.S. casinos and small theaters. Today, he puts out albums regularly, singing old and new songs in his high and nasally but charming and inviting voice. On his most recent album, 2012's \"The Real Neil,\" he interrupts himself on \"Amarillo\" to shout things such as \"big finish!\" The collection closes with \"Manhattan Intermezzo,\" an 18-minute symphonic piece, which, recalling his Juilliard days, he describes as going \"back to my roots.\"\nSedaka has a love-hate relationship with modern songwriting. He praises Sam Smith, Bruno Mars and others who emphasize traditional melodies. But in his recent \"Sweet Music,\" he says, \"Who cares what the rappers say? Don't understand a word they say. What happened to the melody? What happened to the harmony?\" Regarding pop superstar Taylor Swift's recent \"Bad Blood,\" which shares a title with a Sedaka solo hit, he says: \"I've seen it mentioned a lot on the Internet, and I've asked about it. You can't copyright a title. ... But you know, she's a marvelous artist -- and certainly I'm very proud of my 'Bad Blood.' \"\nIn his career, Sedaka has released 55 albums, and he's preparing one more. \"Once a year, I sit down at the piano and say to myself, 'This is the last time I'm going to do it because that blank piece of paper scares the (stuff) out of me, and how am I going to top the last?'\" he says. \"But somehow that's the creative force.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1732928&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1732928", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1732928&h=Neil+Sedaka+doesn%27t+quite+have+a+million+of+%27em%2C+but+he%27s+close"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:34:47.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
