The pair have been mulling the project since the late 1990s and had originally envisaged it as a movie.\nThe director, known for gritty crime movies liberally spiced with swearing and graphic violence but also original, imaginative cinematography, says he has no plans to stop work.\n\"I don't know, as many as I could make,\" he said when asked how many more movies he planned to make.\nArts & Entertainment Media Martin Scorsese Robert De Niro", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:58:08.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
