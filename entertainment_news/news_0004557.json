Castronovo will be required to undergo counseling for domestic violence offenders and drug abuse. \nThe Marion County District Attorney's Office says Castronovo faces more than five years in prison if he violates the terms of his probation. \nCastronovo was arrested June 14. Proescutors said he knowingly caused physical injury to a woman. \nHe was arrested again two weeks later and ordered to stay behind bars when prosecutors said he texted the woman 122 times and called her 35 times despite a no-contact order. \nCastronovo has been with Journey since 1998, when he replaced Steve Smith.
