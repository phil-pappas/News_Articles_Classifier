After returning to the stage for a memorable appearance at the Emmy Awards in Sept ., Morgan is now onstage to perform. The comedian will host Saturday Night Live this Saturday, but, perhaps as a warm-up, he stopped by New York's Comedy Cellar for a set on Monday -- his first real performance since the accident. Morgan tweeted a photo of himself onstage:\nMy first time on stage in 16 Months at the #ComedyCellar ! Picking up the pieces! pic.twitter.com/T2uD2Zndot\n— Tracy Morgan (@RealTracyMorgan) October 13, 2015 \"I'm here, standing on my own two feet. And God bless all of you for your love, your prayers, your positive thoughts for the past months,\" Morgan said onstage at the Emmys. \"It's been a long road back. \"\nHe elaborated backstage: \"If God can get you to it, he'll get you through it. And I'm here. My wife kept saying, 'We'll get through it, we'll get back to the funny.' And we did that tonight…It's time for us to start laughing again. And that's what we did.\"\nMorgan will return to SNL , where he was a cast member for seven years, on Saturday at 11:30 p.m., alongside musical guest Demi Lovato.\nUSA TODAY\nTracy Morgan: 'Time to start laughing again'\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1REutgI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1REutgI&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f46324f960b8ce12d74c7c54bc9691468753b8b/c=0-0-2236-2236/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635783909719409925-AP-2015-PRIMETIME-EMMY-AWARDS---SHOW-76109288.JPG", "https://twitter.com/RealTracyMorgan/status/653726140847247360", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803230424253542-XXX-20150920-EMMY-AWARDS-APS-145.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc778900fdfba41e867f677f10d1091806bccf20/c=172-0-2828-1997&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803230424253542-XXX-20150920-EMMY-AWARDS-APS-145.JPG", "http://t.co/T2uD2Zndot", "http://usat.ly/1REutgI", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803230424253542-XXX-20150920-EMMY-AWARDS-APS-145.JPG", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ComedyCellar?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1REutgI&text=Tracy%20Morgan%20performs%20first%20stand-up%20show%20since%20accident&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:51:44.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
