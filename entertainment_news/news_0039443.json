Even fellow crowd seducer Hugh Jackman was at his first of three Rod Laver Arena shows last night, smiling ear to ear. And Mr Jackman is a man who knows a thing or two about live performances. \nWilliams and his excellent band served up wall to wall hits, and not just his own. With my @Deborra_lee and @robbiewilliams one of the greatest live performances. Ever. pic.twitter.com/CACXb73pXF — Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) October 22, 2015 \nThe British singer not only grew up loving Queen, he busts out part of We Will Rock You and a full Bohemian Rhapsody in this tour, mainly because he can. \nWilliams even sings the Queen epic in front of the original video, leaving the band’s trademark operatic vocals behind him for the start of the song, but it’s far from karaoke. \nFreddie Mercury is the perfect role model for any entertainer and Williams clearly took plenty of notes. Entertained ... Hugh Jackman and his wife Deborra enjoying watching Robbie Williams in concert.

No one else could pull off Rock DJ, Kids, Let Me Entertain You, Monsoon or Supreme. There’s even a throwback to his beginnings in boy band Take That with Back for Good, performed with his opening act Lawson (Hugh Jackman knew every single word, FYI). Language warning ... Robbie Williams with Tim Metcalfe and Flynn Francis, his Melbourne songwriting partners, performing Motherf . Picture: Melissa Reed TTM Source: Supplied \nWhile it’s a greatest hits set, Williams has added album tracks Me and My Monkey and Hot Fudge, the latter performed in an upright bed with a lady pulled from the audience. You don’t see that at a Justin Timberlake concert. \nAlthough never a hit in Australia (the reason he dumped UK No. 1 Candy) The Road to Mandalay (also with Lawson) shows he was doing Mumford & Sons-style folk before they’d picked up a fiddle. \nWhile you’d love to hear hits like Bodies, Tripping, Strong, Old Before I Die or something more rare for the diehards (H. E. Swas on the setlist but dumped at the last minute), this is a show about pleasing the people and reintroducing himself after last year’s Swing tour — there’s a nod to Sinatra but only at the very end. Stacks on Robbie ... Working it. Picture: David Crosling Source: News Corp Australia Touch the sky ... Doing his thing. Picture: David Crosling Source: News Corp Australia \nAt one point he singles out by name a diehard woman who’s flown in from France (“I’m playing there next year, you could have saved some money”) and spots fans he’s recognised from shows in Brisbane and Adelaide. That’s the mark of a classy performer who knows how to make people feel special. \nAfter his awkward run-in with a 15 year old in Brisbane, any time Williams interacts with a female on stage he now asks their age first, like the most famous bouncer in the world. \nWilliams is so endearing that even bleak, broken songs like Feel and Come Undone become huge anthems that, as cheesy as it sounds, have a healing feeling when they become singalongs. \nHis father Pete joins him on stage for Better Man, his Melbourne songwriting partners and “brothers” Tim Metcalfe and Flynn Francis get a hometown welcome for new song Motherf----, written for Williams’ young son Charlie. Floor work ... Robbie meets the people at Rod Laver Arena. Picture: David Crosling Source: News Corp Australia \nThere’s seamless segways into other people’s songs all night — a bit of U2 after Come Undone, Lorde’s Royals before Millennium and Jay Z’s 99 Problems during it and some Led Zeppelin to introduce Kids. He belts out the chorus of Oasis’ Wonderwall at one stage, as well as World Party’s She’s the One, a cover he’s made his own. \nWhile he jokingly introduced Angels with “here’s my hit” (it shamefully actually only peaked at No. 40 in Australia) that song, and the reaction it gets, again proves he doesn’t need other people’s tunes, he’s got a timeless classic all of his own. \nRobbie Williams plays Rod Laver Arena again tonight and Saturday, before his final Australian shows on this tour at Sydney’s Allphones Arena next Tuesday and Wednesday.
