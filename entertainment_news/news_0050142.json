How was the experience playing Kanchanamala?\nI believe that there is absolutely no point in spending time in such a rewarding craft as mine without investing my all. The experience of portraying Kanchanamala was certainly rewarding since it was set in an intensely political, social and emotional backdrop.\nYou have said playing certain roles have also helped you evolve as a person — Panimalar (Mariyaan) and Sarah have stuck with you even after your movies. Was it the same with Kanchanamala?\nThis craft, being of psychological nature, the changes that I feel within me at the end of portraying a character and what it leaves behind can't be explained scientifically. It's more of how it changes and improves my perception towards life and people. My job is partly anthropological in nature. By studying people and their lives, I believe I become a much more sensitive human being. It keeps me from being self-righteous and judgemental. Transformation is constant and it can be really overwhelming after each film. Ultimately, for me that is the highest reward. To be a better person, that is!\nYour roles as Panimalar and Kanchanamala are similar in the sense both are inspiring, strong-willed women. Did it make the process easier? Absolutely not. What I have learned is each character I have portrayed handle challenges in a unique way and the characters go through very different spectrum of changes even if the challenges are similar. That leaves no room for loaning one character's experience for another. Also, it would be boring if I do that!\nAll your roles recently have been equally important as those portrayed by the heroes. Is that deliberate?\n(Laughs) No! I only look at experiencing the story during a narration and see how the character offered affects me or challenges me. Also, if the role actively participates in the progress of the story.\nHow's the experience of working with Dulquer again in Charlie?\nDulquer is a very good co-actor who respects everyone's space and processes. It's not very often you find an actor wishing to work on a scene together to make it better. It's odd that it's a rarity; but when you do get someone who likes rehearsing and is striving to be better, it's a treat.\nFor someone who avoids repeating characters, what made you take up the Tamil remake of Bangalore Days, Arjun Divya Matrum Karthik? I honestly just wished to test my own theory of not wishing to reprise a role. Sarah, I felt, was the best character to try this out with and explore different techniques of performance in a familiar space.\nYou do very few movies a year—what do you do the rest of the time?\nIt's not that I decided to do only one movie a year. The filming process these days is longer than before and since I do only one movie a time, it may look like a long gap between movies. And I do take some time off after each movie to refresh and reset.\nResearch plays a big part in your roles. For someone who did not have prior acting education, how did you perfect the craft of acting? Research is what makes my job the most interesting for me. I get to study the character in depth, which means study the place she was born in, the circumstances she was brought up in, the political, social and emotional landscape of the script. So, that is the part where I create the foundation and I better make it solid as I will have to feed off that space throughout the filming period. I realised how deep and intricate this art is post Notebook and I went on to read as much about the craft and attend workshops. And, I'm still learning.
