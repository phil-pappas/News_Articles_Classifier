My husband Gregory, who works in television most of the time, has described himself as a \"FedEx package.\" Meaning he gets shipped off to all sorts of locales for work. In the last two seasons months alone it's been Mexico City, Savannah, GA, Atlanta, GA, Chicago, Toronto, Virginia, and Vancouver, BC. I might be forgetting one or two. \nThis is largely the result of runaway production. And since it's unlikely to change in the near future, a few years ago we started strategizing a family move to a place where he'd be able to go to work in the morning and come home at night. \nAnd so on August 1st Gregory, myself and our twin 5-year-olds Niccola and Allegra all got into a U-haul pulling a car trailer and car alongside a mini-van packed to the top. We drove for three days and then crossed the border into Canada and pulled up at our new house in Vancouver. \nBecause Gregory was on the television show \"Fear The Walking Dead, t'he organization and packing largely fell to me. As you can imagine, it was a cathartic and confronting experience. We had lived in our townhouse for 11 years and in that time had gone from being a married couple to a family of four. \nOver and over again I found myself asking the question, \"What can you let go of?\" And this question brings me to today's blog. \nWhat can you let go of? \nOften when I'm working with clients there comes an a-ha moment where they realize that in order to accomplish their next big goal, they will have to let go of something- sometimes much more then one thing--to create space for their next big leap. \nThere are lots of examples of this in our lives... If we get sober, we often have to leave behind our drinking buddies. When we have children, the friends who were our wing-men and women at clubs and events become less a part of our lives. This is the wheel of time and change. It's part of life. \nBut sometimes it can be helpful--or even liberating--to consciously and pro-actively assess our lives. Instead of leaving things behind because of circumstance, to proactively choose what activities, people and objects we want to have in our lives now. What our values are now, and then to seek out what reflect those values. \nDoes this hit you close to (your cluttered) home? \nIf this feels like something you want or need to do, here are a few steps to help you through this process... \nLet's start by listing your top 5 values. Here are some examples to get you going... Spirituality. Family. Community. Health. Creativity. Service or Contribution. Education. Personal Growth. Relationship with Significant Other. Integrity. Money. Productivity. \nAs you list these values, some things or people or habits might jump out at you right away. These things might not be aligned with your values as you've prioritized them. Make a list of what jumps out at you. You might not have to dig that far for things to let go of. They might present themselves straight-away. \nThis could include a person who despite being your friend is actually toxic for you. Or a habit that despite your in-the-moment enjoyment isn't really aligned with your values-- and therefore is hindering your growth. \nOnce you have your list of your top 5 values, my next suggestion is to walk around your home and workspace and take time to look at things.
