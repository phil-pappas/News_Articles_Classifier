Previews begin March 1. \nKrasinski, whose films include \"Leatherheads\" and \"Kinsey,\" will soon star as a Navy SEAL in Michael Bay's upcoming film \"13 Hours.\" \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:05:19.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
