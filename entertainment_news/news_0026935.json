They play five losers who come together to form a band to prove that music never dies, in a typical underdog story which is Nagesh's speciality.\nThe idea was triggered by the fact that actors earlier sang their own songs, but then they started getting professional singers to lend them their voices. \"I thought why not make a film about music with musicians I respect,\" says the director, who tossed the concept a year ago to Shankar who was so excited that he offered to call the colourful percussionist Sivamani himself and get him on board.\nSalim, who Nagesh has known forever, was easy to coax too and so was Papon \"who came into my life late but brought with him the joy of music\". The nervous one was Sunidhi who, though a fantastic, versatile singer was unsure about acting. \"I'm blindly saying yes because of you,\" she said.\nNagesh admits that the reason he got his dream line-up is because all the singers have a healthy respect for each other. Many of them, he points out, have appeared in music videos and reality shows so they are comfortable on camera. \"The challenge is to get them to perform as a character,\" he admits.\nIt's a tongue-in-cheek comedy which pokes fun at the music industry. \"Today, if you go to a label to sell your music, the first question you're asked is who will the songs be picturised on. If you say newcomers, there is no price for your score even before anyone has heard it,\" laughs Nagesh, admitting that given the market he can't blame anyone really. So will he rope in a Bollywood actor to make a special appearance? \"No, the premise of the film is music for music's sake so we are going with only musicians,\" he asserts.\nHis film will have eight-nine original compositions by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Salim-Sulaiman, Papon and Tapas Relia, the music director of Mod, Lakshmi and Dhanak. \"Sivamani is also composing a song,\" he beams. He plans to finish the film by February. A lot will be shot in the first schedule but, since all five are active musicians, getting their dates together is difficult, and the shoot will spill to next year. He doesn't plan to go with it on the festival circuit.\n\"Since the film is all about music it will have a big India release,\" he signs off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:01:06.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
