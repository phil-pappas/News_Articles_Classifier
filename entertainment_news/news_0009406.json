She announced that she would be leaving the 5 and 11 p.m. anchor desk to devote her time to \"long-form in-depth stories\" and continue her duties as host of KGO's public affairs show, \"Beyond the Headlines.\" ABC 7 News anchors Cheryl Jennings, right, and Don Sanchez in the tent at the Ronald McDonald House cocktail reception on March 22, 2014. (Janet Duca Norton) \nJennings told her followers on Facebook that she's \"really excited by this new opportunity\" and that it was her decision to leave the anchor desk. Some, however, have speculated that management may have nudged her in that direction. \nJust last year, Carolyn Johnson, one of KGO's most high-profile anchors, left the station after telling this publication that she was asked to take a pay cut amid budgetary trimming at KGO. Johnson had two years left on her contract but opted to move to a station in Southern California. \nThe Sze and Thomas moves were first reported by Bay Area media blogger Rich Lieberman. The two anchors had been a fixture on KGO's morning telecast for at least 15 years. Advertisement \nSze will become the 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. co-anchor when Jennings moves into her new role later this year. Thomas will move to weekend anchor and reporter. \nZouves came from San Diego's KGTV in July. Aqui recently left Portland's KGW to work at KGO. \nKGO is owned and operated by ABC. A station spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
