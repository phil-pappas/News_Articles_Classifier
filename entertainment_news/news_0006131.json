TMZ.com said he has a 50/50 chance of survival. \nOdom's courtship and four year marriage to Khloe Kardashian was featured on reality TV show \"Keeping up With the Kardashians\" and its spin-off \"Khloe and Lamar.\" Although the couple signed divorce papers in July, the divorce has not yet been finalized by a judge and they are still legally married. \nCable channel E! says it is not filming for the reality show in Las Vegas but has not said how it plans to handle Odom's situation when the show resumes broadcasts next month. \nOdom's two teenage children from a previous relationship issued a statement thanking his fans for their \"outpouring of prayers and support for our dad.\" \n\"We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers,\" said Destiny and Lamar Odom Jr. Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:14:59.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
