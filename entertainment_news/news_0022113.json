A light lunch also will be served. \nAdmission is free, although registration is required by calling 1-877-447-4636. \nIn her dark comedy, the Los Angeles-based Tamases plays a sassy operator taking calls from an array of quirky body parts. \nThe play was nominated for two Los Angeles Theatre Ovation Awards, including for Best World Premiere Play and Best Lead Actress. \nThe panel discussion will include Tamases and three Greenville Health System professionals: \n•Brian McKinley, M.D., surgical oncologist with Greenville Health System’s Breast Health Center. \n•Donald W. Wiper III, M.D., chairman of GHS Department of OB/GYN and a gynecologic oncologist. \n•Gina Franco, manager of GHS Cancer Institute’s Center for Integrative Oncology & Survivorship and herself a cancer survivor. \nThe panel will explore strategies for cancer prevention and provide information on new treatments, integrated therapies and research trials. Panelists also will talk about survivorship and unique concerns and challenges faced by survivors. \nDr. McKinley will address the newly released mammogram guidelines. The American Cancer Society recently recommending that women at average risk of breast cancer get annual mammograms starting at age 45 rather than at age 40, and that women 55 and older scale back screening to every other year. \nThe Greenville Health System is also a co-sponsor of the event. \nThe Greenville Jewish Federation was particularly interested in sponsoring the event, Hammer said, because eastern European Jewish women have a 40 percent higher rate of breast cancer and 85 percent higher rate of ovarian cancer due to the BRCA gene mutation. \nFor the latest in local arts news and reviews, follow Paul Hyde on Facebook and Twitter: @PaulHyde. \nYOU CAN GO \nWhat: “Jonna’s Body, Please Hold: A Cancerous Dark Comedy,” followed by a panel discussion; light lunch will be served \nWhen: 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Friday (Oct. 23) \nWhere: Centre Stage, 501 River St. \nTickets: Admission-free but registration is required \nInformation: 1-877-447-4636 or ghs.org/healthevents 17 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LPvCkO MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:59:59.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
