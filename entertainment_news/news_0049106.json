The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup. \nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27. \nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. \nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/ \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:23:01.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
