Cat lovers, shelters and rescues from around the world will be celebrating the colorful and wondrous purrsonalities of cats and working to help save their lives.\nNational Cat Day 2014 exploded the internet, trending #1 worldwide on Twitter, with the support of a myriad of A-list celebrities celebrating with their cats. This year is sure to be just as grand as the last, presented again by BLUE Naturally Fresh Cat Litter and Petco joining the National Cat Day family and celebrating the day at all Petco stores across the nation, by offering a 20% discount on all Blue Buffalo cat products for October 29th only. Petco also offers in-store adoptions, so if considering adopting on Cat Day, cat lovers are encouraged to check their local Petco for fur kids in need of a good home.\nPet & Family Lifestyle Expert and Founder of National Cat Day, Colleen Paige said, “We’re so excited to have BLUE Naturally Fresh and Petco as our presenting sponsors for our 10th Anniversary celebration! Ten years ago when I founded this day, I never imagined that National Cat Day would have grown to save as many cats as it has and that it would become a worldwide trending holiday every October 29th. It just goes to show how much people love cats, how valuable they are and how they've become just as popular as dogs, in that they give the same unconditional love. I thank my sponsors and all the cat lovers in the world for making this day as successful as it has become in promoting adoption and saving, what we estimate to be, over a million cats globally in the last ten years.\"\n“Blue Buffalo is excited to once again be a part of National Cat Day”, said Sean Sterner, Blue Buffalo Marketing Manager. “As we help celebrate the 10th anniversary of this event, it’s incredible to see how much awareness and support Colleen’s team has provided to help thousands of shelter cats find their forever home. The partnership with Petco for this year’s event means a lot to us in helping achieve this goal.\"\nThis year’s highlights will include two photo contests, one, the “Search for the Most Lovable Shelter Cat” for shelters and rescues to enter photos of adoptable cats hoping to win 1500 pounds of BLUE Naturally Fresh Cat Litter and the other, The National Cat Day “Most Cuddly Cat” for cat parents to submit photos of their cat in a cuddly moment for a chance to win the grand prize of a year’s supply of BLUE Naturally Fresh Cat Litter. There will also be second and third place winners who will receive 6 months and 3 months of litter, respectively. Also part of the festivities is a wonderful animated short film by Theory Animation in honor of National Cat Day, featuring YouTube stars, Ray & Clovis.
