This can be true for anyone who has made a commitment to another person and finds themselves at place where the challenge is more than one can handle. It is important to remember that relationships change over time and your connection and intimacy with your spouse/partner can be affected. But this does not have to be the case. It is important to remember that you fell in love for a reason. You have a shared history and this is what we seek to repair and restore.\nOur counselors follow the Gottman Method for Healthy Relationships as well as an Emotionally-Focused Couples Theory. Both are highly researched and evidence-based treatments. According to the Gottman Method, created by Drs. John and Julie Gottmann, couples must continue to grow in their fondness for one another, be able to influence each other, and turn toward and not away from their partner. Our counselors help couples learn and utilize these skills for a healthier relationship.\nEmotionally Focused Couples Therapy , founded by Drs. Sue Johnson and Les Greenberg, is rooted in Attachment Theory and the belief that couples need to have a secure emotional attachment with one another in order to feel safe and vulnerable. Once a secure bond is achieved, couples can restructure their interactions and responses.\nAbout Hidden Stream Counseling\nOur therapists share a common vision to help our clients succeed in ways that are meaningful to each individual. We believe that within each person, there exists a hidden stream. At times, there may be rocks and debris that have blocked the flow of this stream. As a result, individuals may feel emotional, physical, or relational pain. Our goal at Hidden Stream Counseling is to help clients explore and examine what has disrupted their inner stream and dislodge these items so it can once again flow freely. This is the essence of the mind-body connection. As therapists, we believe that there is a powerful connection between an individual's emotional well-being and their physical and spiritual health.\n release/hidden-stream-counseling-announce-the-launch-of-their-marriage-counseling-support-website-414527.php", "external_links": ["https://marriagecounselingbyhiddenstream.wordpress.com/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/hidden-stream-counseling-announce-the-launch-of-their-marriage-counseling-support-website-414527.php"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:40:22.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
