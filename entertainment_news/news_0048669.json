His arraignment was postponed for the second day in a row, this time until the end of the month at the request of his newly appointed public defender.\nHe was charged Wednesday with 10 crimes, including two counts of murder in the shooting deaths of Paul “Joey” Lesh, 66, and Benjamin Franklin “Benny” Johnson, 34, both of Banning. He is eligible for the death penalty, but the district attorney has not decided whether to pursue it.\nMichael Sokoloff, a firefighter from San Diego County, said Diaz Jr. assaulted him Feb. 19, 2014, at a firefighters convention party at the San Diego Firehouse Museum.\nDiaz Jr. was charged with felony battery with serious bodily injury, according to San Diego County Superior Court documents. In September 2014, Diaz pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of misdemeanor battery.\n“I told the DA in San Diego when they let him off, that this guy was going to (expletive) kill someone,” Sokoloff said by phone Thursday. “That guy is crazy, man.”\nDiaz Jr. was sentenced to 20 days in a public-service work program, ordered to complete an anger-management program and pay a $900 fine, and placed on probation for three years, according to court records.\nIn December, he was granted a motion to have his probation terminated early and his record expunged.\n‘HE ALMOST KILLED ME’\nSokoloff said he still can’t believe the charge was pleaded down, given the severity of his injuries, and was shocked when informed that Diaz Jr. had his record expunged.\n“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he said.\nMessages left with two spokespeople with the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office late Thursday afternoon were not returned.\nSokoloff said Diaz Jr. knocked him unconscious from behind, then continued to pummel him while he was knocked out. He suffered minor bleeding on the brain, had his lip split to his nose and had stitches on the back of his head. He was in the ICU for three days, he said.\n“He almost killed me,” the 47-year-old Sokoloff said.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:08:57.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
