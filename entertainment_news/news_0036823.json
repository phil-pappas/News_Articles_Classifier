Getty Images SANDY COHEN, The Associated Press Posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015, 12:03 PM \nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Chris Rock is coming back to host the Oscars for a second time. \nThe show's producers say the prolific comedian-filmmaker will be at the helm for the 88th Academy Awards on Feb. 28 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Producers David Hill and Reginald Hudlin called Rock \"the MVP of the entertainment industry.\" \nThe 50-year-old entertainer, who hosted the 77th Oscars in 2005, posted a photo of himself with an Oscar statuette on Twitter Wednesday with the caption, \"Look who's back.\" \nRock is the only non-white Oscar host to helm the show in the past 10 years. The film academy has visibly increased its diversity outreach efforts since it was derided earlier this year for its all-white slate of acting nominees. \nRock has won four Emmy Awards for his comedy series and specials. He recently directed the comedy special \"Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo\" for HBO. In 2014, he wrote, directed and starred in the feature \"Top Five,\" and in 2009, he produced, wrote and starred in the documentary \"Good Hair.\" \nRock created and produced the TV series \"Everybody Hates Chris,\" which aired from 2005 to 2009. Other acting credits include the \"The Longest Yard,\" ''Lethal Weapon 4\" and the \"Madagascar\" animated movies. He also appeared on Broadway in 2011. \nHe was a cast member on \"Saturday Night Live\" from 1990 to 1993. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:49:33.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
