And officials plan to create more.\nThe single-stall bathrooms, designated by the image of a toilet rather than a silhouetted man or woman, are designed to make students of all genders and gender identities feel comfortable. The bathrooms are also an option for handicapped people who require the assistance of an attendant of the opposite gender.\nThere are three gender-neutral bathrooms in the Health and Science Center, a few in the Physical Education Center, and a gender-neutral bathroom and changing area in the Chaparral Fitness poolside locker room, which can be accessed with a key from the pool's front desk.\nAdministrators plan to open several more gender-neutral bathrooms, including ones at the Berg Instructional Center and the McAninch Arts Center, said Earl Dowling, vice president of student affairs. The process of transforming a bathroom can range from easy to complex, he said, depending on how much remodeling the bathroom requires.\nConverting the current gender neutral bathrooms was a relatively simple process, Dowling said. The only costs required were those of new signage, which cost about $150 for every two bathrooms, he said.\nCOD has about 20 students who openly identify as transgender, though Dowling said that, in reality, there could be \"multiples of 20.\" Transgender student Sara Smollen said the decision to open the bathrooms \"definitely makes a difference.\"\nSmollen underwent her gender transformation this past year, she said. Before her transition, she worked at the COD bookstore, where she would be forced to wait until the store emptied out before using the men's bathroom to minimize the chances of running into someone.\nAfter her transition, she began using the women's bathroom, but said the situation felt equally uncomfortable.\n\"I've heard of many cases of people actually being mean, so I feared something might happen to me, because out in the world you see cases where someone might even attack you,\" she said.\nSmollen is a fire science student studying to be a firefighter, which means many of her classes are in buildings that don't yet have gender-neutral bathrooms. Still, she views the decision as a big step forward.\n\"I am so glad that they're kind of realizing the necessity of this,\" she said. \"For trans men and women, it isn't a big deal, especially further in their transition when they begin to look more like the gender they want to look like. But these bathrooms are a good fit for people who don't fit into either gender, who are either gender neutral or gender fluid.\"\nThe administration began seriously pursuing a plan to create gender-neutral bathrooms last year, Dowling said. The idea was brought up by both student affairs officials as well as the college's athletic director, who told Dowling that an elderly couple who used the pool's community swim hours struggled with gendered locker rooms.\nThe elderly man, Dowling said, was unable to change himself without the assistance of his wife. Once they finished swimming, the wife would change in the women's locker room and then drive her towel-clad husband home, where she could help him change.\nOnce administrators realized the growing necessity for gender-neutral bathrooms, the decision seemed simple, Dowling said.\nDowling said he became emotional when, two weeks ago, the elderly couple used the gender-neutral bathroom in the pool locker room for the first time.\n\"It gives you goosebumps when you think about it,\" he said. \"That this couple could go into the gender-neutral bathroom and come out dressed. It's those little things, that they went to the pool together and then went home dressed together, that make you feel good.\"\nmeltagouri@tribune.com\nTwitter: @marwaeltagouri\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Colleges and Universities Education College of DuPage", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562163c1/turbine/ct-gle-college-of-dupage-gender-neutral-bathrooms-tl-1022-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:16:26.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
