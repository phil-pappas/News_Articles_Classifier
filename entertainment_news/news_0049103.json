The couple were close friends of Simpson and Brown. \nTheir four children – Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob – are now some of the most famous reality TV stars in the world.

John Travolta, Sarah Paulson, Connie Britton and Nathan Lane are also set to star in the drama. \n“Kris Jenner is such an iconic character now that you really don’t have to do anything to prepare,” said Selma. “I mean I talked to her but it’s playing her in the 90s and it just came naturally. Maybe I just have subliminal Kardashian-Jenner in my brain all the time. I think anyone could play her, but I like her very much.” Promoted stories David Schwimmer is playing Kris’s late husband Robert Kardashian (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) \nShe added: “It’s Kardashian osmosis, I think we all have it now.” \nSpeaking on the red carpet at a gala in Beverly Hills for Operation Smile, a charity that provides free surgery for children around the world suffering from facial deformities, the 43-year-old actress said: “I think it’s wonderful when even a small amount of celebrity as mine can really raise awareness for such a big cause. That is when I love to get in front of the cameras and that is when I love to talk about anything to do with children and making their lives and their parents’ lives easier. Selma with her Universal Smile Award (John Salangsang/AP) \n“Operation Smile has always been an organisation that puts the money right there to help the children and volunteers and it saves their lives, not just their smiles.” \nSelma, who is mother to four-year-old son Arthur, received the Universal Smile Award at the gala and said her little boy gives her reason to smile every day. \n“Of course my son, I think every mother says that. My son and my friends who are with me tonight who will take a night out of their lives to give me hugs.” Share article \nAmerican Crime Story is set to air in the United States in 2016.
