Filming The Levelling - second assistant camera Josefine Theinne with the clapperboard Pictures: Lizanne Phee Filming The Levelling - boom operator Jo Andrews and gaffer Finn Varney Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed in Game of Thrones Pictures: Jordan Dubash Filming The Levelling - production sound mixer John Hughes on set Pictures: Lizanne Phee Comments (0) \nThis is Game of Thrones star Ellie Kendrick's new film – a drama set in the aftermath of the Somerset Levels flood disaster \nThis gallery shows the film crew at work on the set of The Levelling, a poignant but ultimately uplifting film which stars Ellie – who played Meera Reed in Game of Thrones – as the daughter of a dairy farmer. \nHer character, Clover Catto, returns to the family farm to support her estranged father after her brother apparently commits suicide six months after the floods which covered much of the Levels last year. \nEllie is perhaps better to terrestrial TV viewers in Britain as the girl who played Anne Frank in the BBC adaptation of her story.
