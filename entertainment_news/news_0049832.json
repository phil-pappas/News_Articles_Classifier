This didn’t make her any less conspicuously RiRi, of course. \nShe later ramped up the style for a front row appearance, with a giant fur and leather coat. \nMeanwhile, Kendall Jenner stole the show at Balmain. Half-sister Kim Kardashian may have been the talk of the town last season after debuting a new blonde hairstyle, but this time it was Kendall’s turn. \nShe modelled two looks – a space-age sixties jumpsuit, and a white geometric lattice dress.
