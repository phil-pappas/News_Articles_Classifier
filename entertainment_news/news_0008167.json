After playing a YouTube video called \"Top 60 Ghetto Names,\" Raven-Symoné said, \"I am very discriminatory against [names] like the ones that they were saying in the [video]. I'm not about to hire you if your name is Watermelondrea. It's just not going to happen. I'm not going to hire you.\" \nRaven-Symoné says she wouldn't hire someone with a black-sounding name \nThe former child star received immediate backlash from viewers for the insensitive remarks. Her own father, Christopher B. Pearman , wrote an open letter Friday about his daughter's \"inexcusable gaffe.\" \n\"Children grow up and become influenced by many things, situations and people. I certainly don't agree with what she said....but she is damn near thirty years old. She's a grown ass woman making grown ass mistakes. We all have been guilty of this,\" Pearman wrote on Facebook. \"Her Mother and I Love her Very much and will always support her and have her back. Even if sometimes she says some dumb S#%T!\" \nIn her own message, Raven-Symoné says she should've been more sympathetic since she has been a victim of discrimination herself. \n\"I have been denied many jobs because of my skin color, body size, and age. Each time I was rejected, my self-esteem was negatively effected [sic], so I empathize with those who feel victimized by what I said,\" she wrote. \"We would hope that when it comes to hiring, our names, physical appearance, sexual orientation, and age would never outweigh our qualifications, but often times, they do, thats [sic] the truth and it sucks. But I should not be part of the problem, I should be part of the solution.\" \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:18:49.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
