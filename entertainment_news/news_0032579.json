He was like, 'That would be pretty good!'\"Then our managers got in touch pretty quick and the ball was rolling, so he was serious from the off. Ed is very driven, so if he wants something he goes after it.\"39-year-old Jamie Lawson was the first signing to Ed Sheeran's Gingerbread Man Records earlier this year, and the re-release of his single 'Wasn't Expecting That' has so far peaked at number six in the UK and three in Australia. The story goes that Ed decided to sign Jamie to his label after being so moved by one of his performances that he cried.So has Jamie managed to get Ed sobbing again since? \"He said he was tearing up the other day,\" Jamie revealed.\"He was showing the video to someone and for whatever reason he almost went again, which is quite funny. It's weird how it does that. It gets me sometimes, that song.\"Jamie Lawson's new self-titled album is out now in the UK, and is currently heading towards the top spot in the UK this Friday (October 23).Watch the music video for Jamie Lawson's 'Wasn't Expecting That' below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:58:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
