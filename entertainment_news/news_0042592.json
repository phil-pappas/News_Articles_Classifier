The former UP chief minister had slammed the UP government for not taking action against local BJP leaders for their alleged role in the killing of a 52-year-old man in Dadri area of west UP over rumours the he stored and consumed beef. ”Mayawati has nothing to do. She is sitting like ‘nithalli’ (one who has nothing to do). She comes here (in Lucknow) to issue statements. (Also Read: Man dies of swine flu, Delhi reports first H1N1 death) “Her allegations against SP are laughable as she herself became chief minister of the state twice with the help of BJP,” senior SP leader Shivpal Yadav told reporters here. ”Mayawati had also gone to Gujarat for campaigning in favour of Narendra Modi. BJP is a facist party and if BSP and BJP tried to vitiate communal atmosphere of the state, they would be dealt strictly,” he said. Yadav also said that SP was fighting commnal forces for a long time and would continue doing so. ”Today, attempts are being made in Karhal (Mainpuri) to vitiate communal atmosphere. We are ensuring arrest of those involved in the incident there,” he said. Mayawati had earlier in the day targeted Mulayam Singh Yadav on his statment terming the Dadri incident as a conspiracy saying that “such incidents will not stop unless stern action is not taken against the culprits. Putting Azam Khan in the front and raising the matter in the UN will not serve any purpose.” ”His (SP) government should take stern legal action against the conspirators to check these incidents,” she said alleging that BJP and Samajwadi Party are together in it. ”No action has been taken against the BJP leaders and main accused in the Dadri incident,” she alleged. \nModified Date: October 9, 2015 9:08 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:15:40.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
