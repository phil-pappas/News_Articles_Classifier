I have to call a murder a murder, and I have to call the murderers the murderers.\"\nThe director's comments drew the ire of NYPD Association's President Patrick Lynch who called on the city to boycott his films.\"The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls 'murderers' aren't living in one of his depraved big-screen fantasies â€“ they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem,\" Lynch said.\n\"It's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too,\" he mentioned before adding that \"New Yorkers need to send a message,\" by boycotting his films.\nThe event took place just days after the Tuesday-night murder of NYPD officer Randolph Holder, killed while chasing a robbery suspect. \"It's like this: It's unfortunate timing, but we've flown in all these families to go and tell their stories... That cop that was killed. That's a tragedy, too,\" Tarantino said to the New York Post .\n 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' will stream only on Canadian Netflix in 2016 Kristen Wiig responds to criticism of female 'Ghostbusters' 'Martian' is No. 1 at the North American box office", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/10/24/quentin-tarantino-marches-in-police-terror-rally/", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/quentin-tarantino-nypd-spar-over-police-brutality-rally-20151026", "https://www.facebook.com/UnitedPress"], "published": "2015-10-26T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:18:38.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
