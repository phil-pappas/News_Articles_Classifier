Red | Oct. 03, 2015 at 06:00pm \nGinebra San Miguel Inc. (GSMI) introduced its newest calendar girl in a grand launch held recently at the Oak Ballroom, Sequoia Hotel in Quezon City. \nActress, singer and model Arci Muñoz is Ginebra San Miguel’s Calendar Girl for 2016. Arci joins the ranks of popular beauty queens, models and actresses who have graced Ginebra San Miguel’s calendars including two-time calendar girl Marian Rivera (2009 and 2014), Anne Curtis (2011), Solenn Heussaff (2012), Georgina Wilson (2013), Angelica Panganiban (2007) and her Pasion de Amor co-star Ellen Adarna (2015). \nArci, a Theater Arts major at the University of the Philippines, entered show business in 2005 via a talent reality search. Since then, Arci has appeared in several television projects, and is currently the lead vocalist of the rock band Philia. \nIn 2008, she represented the Philippines in the prestigious Asia Supermodel Competition. Her biggest TV break came earlier this year when she landed the lead role in the top-rating drama series Pasion de Amor on ABS-CBN. \n“Being part of the Ginebra San Miguel family is such a big honor and privilege,” says Arci. “I had fun during the photo shoot because our concept for the calendars showed who I am behind the camera. The calendars are actually a sneak peek into my life. Not many people know that I am athletic, that I work out and play basketball. I am a rocker but I also love girly things like fashion,” relates Arci. \nGSMI has released five layouts for its 2016 calendar. “The first Ginebra San Miguel Calendar Girl was launched in 1988, and since then, consumers look forward to this yearly,” says GSMI vice president and Marketing manager Nelson Elises. \n“For 2016, we chose Arci Muñoz as our brand ambassador because she embodies the Ginebra San Miguel brand character—strong, versatile and resilient. She is a complete package. She’s got the beauty and the brains. She is multi-faceted. She’s a singer, an actress and a model. Truly, ‘ganado sa buhay’ and definitely one of the country’s most talented, and hottest up and coming artists,” adds Elises. \nOther past Ginebra San Miguel calendar girls were former beauty queens Anjanette Abayari (1994), Alma Concepcion (1995) and Michelle Aldana (1998); former movie stars and TV personalities Janna Victoria (1999), Patricia Javier (2000), singer Geneva Cruz (2001), Rica Peralejo (2002), Aubrey Miles (2003), Belinda Bright and Maricar De Mesa (2004). \nThis year, Ginebra San Miguel has added a different twist to the annual calendar’s promotions. For every purchase of two bottles of Ginebra San Miguel Bilog, Angelito, Frasquito or a bottle of Frasco at 7-Eleven, MiniStop and other participating outlets, consumers will get a limited edition magazine calendar. To add to this sweet deal, each magazine calendar comes with a set of “Ganado coupons,” which offers discounts and freebies or premium merchandise items in selected outlets. \nGSMI’s flagship brand Ginebra San Miguel has been enjoyed by many for over 180 years and remains the no. 1 selling gin in the world according to leading global drinks journal Drinks International. Last year, Ginebra San Miguel launched its “Ganado sa Buhay” campaign, which celebrated the hardworking Filipino worker who is “ganado sa buhay”, who works hard to provide his family a better future. \nOther GSMI products are GSM Blue, GSM Blue Flavors, Ginebra San Miguel Premium Gin, Don Enrique Mixkila, Antonov Vodka, Vino Kulafu and Primera Light Brandy.

This affirmed, they say, the dangers they have to face in their duty to keep the public safe. \nSusan Roces, widow of Da King and mother of Grace, earlier said how her late husband’s heart was very close to policemen and it was evident in a number of films he made when he was still alive. \nRoces is playing the role of Ador’s grandmother in the TV series, a character that wasn’t in the original movie but has been added to underscore the drama between the twins Ador and Cardo. \nPoe, as head of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, led the investigation of the alleged involvement of former PNP Chief Alan Purisima in corruption. It is also part of the clean up of the PNP force. \nShe is also batting for the modernization of the police force, providing its members the necessary equipment to make them effective and efficient in providing security to the general public. \nAnd so, this is the start of making sure Grace finishes what FPJ has started. Janine Gutierrez is Dangwa Girl \nAfter stirring social media recently for giving roses to a male student, the mystery lady tagged by everyone as “Dangwa Girl” finally reveals herself – she is no other than GMA Artist Center talent and fashion muse Janine Gutierrez. \nAs revealed in GMA’s 24 Oras newscast last Thursday, Gutierrez is the unrecognizable face behind the rosy teasers flashed on television. \nGutierrez stars in GMA’s upcoming show entitled Dangwa airing this month. Still nervous and jittery \nJennylyn Mercado, in each live episode of Starstruck, still feels the jitters like it was the first time. She admitted she is really very nervous. \nThis despite her stature now as full-fledged star on GMA Network. \nWhen she’s on the judge’s chair she can’t help but feel nervous. “It is triggered by the drumbeats and the special sound effect of heart beat. “I get a flashback of myself on stage as one of the hopefuls in this competition,: \nMercado was among those who were selected for the first edition of Starstruck. In the end, she was proclaimed ultimate female survivor (or the winner) along with Mark Herras (ultimate male survivor).
