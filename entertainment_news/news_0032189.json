Smith, Johanna Braddy, Yasmine Al Massri and Priyanka Chopra. Photo: Supplied \n \nThe networks are rushing a bunch of big new series to air in a final effort to boost their audience shares before the end of \"official\" ratings in six weeks. Here's a round-up of the hits and flops so far.\nLast Sunday night, three crime thrillers went head to head to head, with sexy young FBI trainee Alex Parrish up against drug-enhanced FBI consultant Brian Finch against mature Geordie cop Vera Stanhope. Result: Vera (ABC) scored 708,000, Quantico (Seven) 696,000 and Limitless (Ten) 538,000 (despite a brief appearance by Oscar winner Bradley Cooper). It's fortunate 56 per cent of Australian viewers have reliable recording devices, so they can time-shift all three for watching later. \nThe Principal , a locally made crime thriller starring Alex Dimitriades, pulled 361,000 for SBS, which caused them to open champagne, while The Player , a US-made crime thriller starring Wesley Snipes, pulled 369,000 for Seven, which cast them into a slough of despond. (Seven only celebrates when a show tops a million, which happened with the new Sunday doco Beach Cops. )\nAdvertisement Nine's The Verdict , a panel game hosted by Karl Stefanovic and inspired by the ABC's Q&A , was beaten by its role model. The Verdict , showing at 8.30pm, pulled 520,000 while Q&A , showing at 9.30pm, pulled 526,000.\nA Place To Call Home , saved from Seven's axe by Foxtel, was the most watched non-sports show of the week on pay TV, with 163,000 viewers (while the most watched sports show was the England v Australia Rugby World Cup match, with 240,000).\n \nOzTAM estimates these were the most watched shows in the week ending October 12:\n#1     V8 Supercars round 10 (Ten), 1.29 million in the mainland capitals\n#2     Nine News Sunday (Nine), 1.18m\n#3     Seven News Sunday (Seven), 1.16m\n#4     The Block (Nine), 1.16m\n#5     Sunday Night   (Seven), 1.09m", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:01:17.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
