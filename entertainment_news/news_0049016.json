X Factor 2015: Which music stars will be helping Cheryl, Rita, Nick and Simon at Judges' Houses? \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nIt’s almost time for The X Factor Judges’ Houses stage – but which chart-toppers will be joining the famous four as they host the contestants and settle down to some difficult choices? \nThe pairings have been all but confirmed. Here’s what we know so far: \nRita Ora teams up with – Meghan Trainor. Meghan Trainor (John Salangsang/Invision) \nAll About That Bass singer Meghan looks set to join Rita. According to Digital Spy, she’ll be the star helping the newbie X Factor judge choose the acts she will take through to the live shows. \nMeghan will be Rita’s right-hand woman as she narrows down her Girls’ category – and, it is rumoured, takes them to Los Angeles. Lucky girls. \nNick Grimshaw teams up with – Mark Ronson. Mark Ronson (Rebecca Cabage/Invision) \nNick Grimshaw has a wealth of music business contacts through his Radio 1 breakfast show, but he’s apparently gone for his pal music producer Mark – who is behind hits such as Uptown Funk. \nSlightly less glamorously than Rita, the two will be retreating to Grimmy’s native Oldham, Greater Manchester, for the Judges’ Houses stage, to decide who to take through from the Boys’ category ahead of the live shows. \nCheryl Fernandez-Versini teams up with – Jess Glynne. Jess Glynne (Omar Vega/AP) \nCheryl will reportedly get help from pop star Jess in choosing her Groups as the judges are expected to whittle down their acts from six to three. \nThere are rumours that they’ll be jetting off to Rome – all right for some… \nSimon Cowell teams up with – Louis Tomlinson. Louis Tomlinson (Jeff Daly/Invision) \nSimon Cowell has dropped Sinitta from Judges’ Houses this year, according to the Radio Times. Instead, he’ll apparently be bringing protege Louis Tomlinson of One Direction fame on board to judge the Overs. \nSupposedly they’ll be off to France – bon chance!
