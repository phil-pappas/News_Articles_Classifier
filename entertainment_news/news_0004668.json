This morning I had breast cancer.\"\nA second picture shows her smiling brightly with another board which reads: \"This evening I don't!\"\nDerbyshire, a former presenter on Newsnight and BBC Radio 5 Live, underwent reconstructive surgery following her operation and on Friday praised her surgeon as \"awesome, kind, clever, very very good at his job. And his whole team\".\nAnd she said she made her diary to help other women in a similar position to her, the Daily Telegraph said.\nIn the footage, Derbyshire says: \"The reason I wanted to talk about what has happened to me is that I am a pretty open person. But also because more than one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer. And here's the thing: having cancer is manageable.\nPromoted stories \"Having a mastectomy is totally do-able. I didn't know that until I got cancer. And that's what I want to tell people. I know everyone is different, and has different experiences. This is mine. And I hope you don't mind me sharing that with you.\"\nDerbyshire will be back at work full-time from October 20, but will have time off for further treatment.\nThe diary will be shown during The Victoria Derbyshire Show from 9.15am on BBC 2.\nIn the video, Derbyshire revealed she had undergone a mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as having lymph nodes on her right hand side removed.\n\"When I woke up (from surgery) I did cry because it was just the relief, the malignant tumour in my right breast is gone, and two or three lymph nodes are gone,\" she explained.\nShe went on to say: \"The word cancer has such a chilling effect...\".\nThe Breakfast presenter also showed off her dressings and drains on her right hand side.\nThe video diary showed the day after the operation, with Derbyshire saying: \"I feel good and a bit tired but that's it.\"\nIt then switches to five days later and her sitting in a park with her dog. She shows viewers the drains she's carrying around with her and says: \"I am restricted in my movement, I can't use my right hand side. In a couple of weeks I'll get the results from all the tissue that's been analysed and taken out of me...\"\nShare article Viewers flooded social media praising her for her bravery.\nQuote: : \"What an incredible woman. Go Victoria!! All the absolute very best! Be strong, you're an inspiration #VictoriaDerbyshire\", and another said: \"Really glad to see Victoria Derbyshire on the mend. Very inspiring woman putting it in a video diary for all to see. #VictoriaDerbyshire.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuE8_0EuWZ4", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:18:14.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
