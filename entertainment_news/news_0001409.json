Lorde, and the witchy singer herself stars as a seductive hit-woman who takes revenge on her lover. \nOn her tumblr she wrote: “I’m super proud of this one. in my head it’s dark electric blues and greens, and it moves like liquid. hope you like it.” \nThe 18-year-old – real name Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O’Connor – is shown getting steamy with an older man. \nBut the man has a wife, who looks on as Lorde chucks her cheating husband in a swimming pool and sets the surface on fire. \nFans were a little confused by the narrative, to say the least. I've watched the Lorde/Disclosure Magnets music video like 5 times today b/c it's really good and really disturbing and I wanna get it. \n— Johanna Grace (@imjohannagrace) September 30, 2015 Wtf I'm confused and disappointed in Magnets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:43:44.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
