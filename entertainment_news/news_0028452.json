Artists from Mongolia, Germany, Latvia, Moldavia, Sweden and Kyrgyzstan will attend the festival. The organizer of the festival and artists of the Mongolian State Academic Theater of Drama, Ts.Bayasgalan, said, “We named the festival The Parade of Winners, because winners of international mono play festivals are participating in the festival. Mongolian artists have a chance to learn from international artists, promote mono play to the public and take part in international festivals. The festival is not a competition, but a chance to exchange experiences with international artists.” The festival started at the State Puppet Theater yesterday. The closing mono play of the festival will be “Book”, based on Johann Wolfgang Goethe’s Faust tragic play. Artist of the State Academic Drama Theater, D.Odgerel, will perform “Book”. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16400   Oct 1  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:11:06.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
