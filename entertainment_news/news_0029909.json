I don’t have to come, but I do because I want to. We keep it quiet because I don’t want to commercialize it. I get a real high from being there. I come home and tell Roy all the stories, and that’s a real lift for both of us. \n“We have people come from all over the world. They all talk to me. Sometimes they see me, and it’s amazing we have been away from the stage for over 12 years, but they remember the day 20 years ago they came to see the show even before that.” \nRoy revealed that the duo have just turned down a six-figure offer to fly to the United Arab Emirates with the cubs for a rich oil sheik to meet them. “Our family is not for sale,” said Roy. He’s recovered well from recent foot surgery and is thinking of a vacation to Colombia. \n“We are proud to live in Las Vegas, the greatest city in the world,” Siegfried continued. “When you see a white tiger, you are blessed and will be happy forever. We have been and are. \n“Las Vegas has been very good to us because it’s where we saw all our dreams come true, and we have tried to be good to it in return. These have been very happy years for us.” \nLittle Emma from Bristol, Conn., was thrilled to meet the two magicians — but more enamored by the little cubs. As part of her Make-a-Wish trip granted by Siegfried & Roy, she was able to swim with the dolphins at the Mirage. \nVisitors can see the cubs daily from noon to 4 p.m. as part of their program dedicated to the protection, conservation and preservation of endangered animals, with a particular focus on big cats — tigers, lions, cheetahs, panthers and leopards. \nOur thanks to contributing photographer Tom Donoghue for his photo gallery. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
