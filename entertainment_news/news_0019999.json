They're making it far away so we'll see what happens when it arrives and I'm very excited. But we're almost ready. \n\"I already got married before. I don't think I'm going to do a veil. I think I'm passed that virgin look.\" \nMeanwhile, the couple recently sent out their luxurious white invitations to 400 guests. \nA source said: \"It cost around $7 to mail each one.\" \nThe duo have arranged a special pre-wedding cocktail reception at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach the day before their lavish nuptials and have requested donations be made to St Jude Children's Research Hospital in lieu of wedding gifts. \nThe actress can't wait to marry Joe, 38, and the insider added: \"Sofia isn't nervous at all.\" bang showbiz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:55:32.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
