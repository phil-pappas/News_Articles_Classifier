Today, Suri, who has partnered with EMI to promote new musical talent, has directed his first music video, “Lamhein,” for the single featuring Anmoll Malik, veteran composer Anu Malik’s daughter as actor and singer. This is Suri's first enterprise in that ‘direction’ after making multiple films, most of which (“Kalyug,” “Raaz-The Mystery Continues,” “Murder 2,” “Aashiqui 2”) were successful. \nUniversal Music released the single recently and presented the video at Hard Rock Cafe with an afternoon event in the presence of Anmoll Malik’s parents, Anu Malik and his wife; video co-star Mohit Marwah (of “Fugly” fame who is Anil Kapoor’s nephew); and Devraj Sanyal of Universal Music. The video is like a complete film in 3.46 minutes and is suffused with emotion like Suri’s movies. The talented director has turned the original video’s “happy” concept on its head by making it a moving tale on how fame can come in the way of romance. \nThe song is a re-creation of British rock band Coldplay’s award-winning song “Paradise” by Anmoll Malik’s dad Anu Malik, who has added a haunting Indian feel and depth to the song. The lyrics are by Manoj Muntashir, who is among the very few new talents in that field who has shown both range and depth. \nAnmoll Malik was first heard in a few lines in the 1996 film “Diljale” as a child singer and later made a mark with “Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Na Kijo” in the 2006 “Umrao Jaan.” She first achieved popularity with “Talli” in “Ugly Aur Pagli” (2008) and has now been praised for “Der Lagaye Kaiko” in “Welcome Back” (2015). While all these songs have been composed by Anu Malik, she has played the brilliant “Old School Girl” in English under Krsna in “Tanu Weds Manu Returns.” \nAn avid listener of overseas music (her father credits her with a lot of his awareness of international music) besides having trained at London’s Trinity College of Music, Anmoll Malik is one of the brightest new singers on the block. \nAs for her legendary father, who began composing music way back in 1978, it is yet another instance of how talent can enhance an existing track into a lovable and classic Indian number despite its non-Indian origins. \nWatch the video here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:45:13.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
