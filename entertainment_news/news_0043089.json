He jokes that he never did and his IQ might even be a few points higher now. \nHe was joined in one sketch by \"30 Rock\" co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer. Fey broke character to inject a serious note: \"We're so happy you're OK. We're even happier you're ready to make people laugh again.\" \nMorgan also brought back two of his familiar characters — Astronaut Jones and animal expert Brian Fellow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:05:28.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
