Phil Mitchell \nThe Halloween episode will see drama for Kathy Beale, Ben and Phil Mitchell, and Dominic revealed that this is the start of a difficult period for Steve McFadden’s character. \n2. Bobby Beale \nJane has struggled to cope with Bobby \nQuite frankly, we’re still reeling from the news that Bobby murdered his sister Lucy, and in the months since the revelation was made during live week, viewers have seen Bobby continue to cause problems for his family. \nNow, Dominic has hinted that we’re going to see an even darker side to the youngster, stating: “Bobby is definitely one to watch, as you’ll see… he’s a little bit of a little bastard!

Vincent Hubbard \nVincent’s been a man of mystery, who clearly has plenty of secrets, and it looks like we’ll finally be getting to find out some of them. \n“There's big stuff for Vincent over the next few months with his feud with Ronnie,” the executive producer said. \"We're going to find out a lot more about Vincent. So far he's been a little bit intriguing, but we're about to find out exactly what's going on behind those glaring eyes.\" \n5. Stacey Branning \nMartin is set to pop the question to Stacey on Halloween - but will she say yes? There have also been a number of questions over the paternity of her baby. James Bye, who plays Martin, previously revealed his thoughts on the storyline, stating: “He’s head over heels in love with her and starting to feel that in return.
