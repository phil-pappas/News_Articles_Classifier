Solid, bold-colored headphones emblazoned with the eye-catching 'b' on the side. \nEver since the good Doctor's eponymous line of headphones came to market, a slow-blow explosion has rocked through the old guard of personal music playback. \nCase in point: I saw a headphones kiosk pop up last year inside my local gas station. Let's see, I need some power steering fluid... pack of smokes. Hell, why not, let's grab a pair of head speakers while we're at it. \nUnreal. Dre and the like blew open a door that for quite some time no one knew needed opening. Nowadays everyone is in the game. You know the routine, you've seen your favorite rapper sponsor a stylish headphone, I'm sure. Head to the Rocky Mountain Audio Festival in Denver this weekend for some sound advice. ( Mark Leffingwell / Staff Photographer ) \nAnd some of the headphones, or most if you ask me, sound outright terrible. \nBut Beats has thankfully tried to at least toe the line of acceptability, sound-wise, even if some models carry weights to make them feel heavy or sport circuits that artificially jack up the bass. Yet most Beats models offer a clarity in the middle and upper range of the spectrum that is at least satisfying. \nBut. If Beats are the best headphones you've listened to, you are missing out. You're missing out big time, my friend. \nMiss out no more! You, oh gentle CU students and Boulder citizenry, you are in a prime position to know the best from the rest. Why is that, you ask? \nBecause the world's premier headphones and personal music device extravaganza calls Denver home once a year. Advertisement \nAnd that once a year is right now, my friends. Friday through Sunday, the country's audio nuts descend (!) on the Denver Tech Center Marriott for the annual Rocky Mountain Audio Festival. \nStarting out as a benign growth on the larger festival years ago, HeadFi.org 's Can Jam Festival (part of Audio Fest, located on the first floor) is now as much a destination for audio lovers as the main show. Taylor \nCan Jam (headphones are also known as cans) is a yearly swirling vortex of everything the portable music universe has to offer. \nI often get asked by friends which headphones they should buy. I must admit, if good sound is anywhere near the top of your list, swimming your way through all of the \"pretty on the outside\" models can be dizzying. \nIf you want to know the truth, a modified pair of $100 headphones literally can sound identical to a $4,000 pair. It happens. It's just science, after all. \nWhat isn't science is the art and form of the devices. Finding the right balance of good sound and good looks is a struggle, but it's a noble pursuit. \nWhat better way to know for yourself than to simply sit down and pick up the headphones or Pono or whatever, and listen. \nTickets are $10 a day. I urge you, dear readers. Grab some friends, pile in the car and shoot down 36 to go listen to the best the world has to offer. \nRead more Taylor: coloradodaily.com/columnists .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:30:02.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
