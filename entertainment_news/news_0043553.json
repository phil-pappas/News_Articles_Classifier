London's Metropolitan Police says the operation cost £11.1m through April 2015.\nThe police said in a statement that Assange is still subject to arrest for jumping bail and holing up in the embassy while wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:03:48.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
