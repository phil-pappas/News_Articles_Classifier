N.C. State transfer Bryant Shirreffs (97 of 153, 1,271 yards, six touchdowns, three interceptions), took hold of the offense in the spring and hasn’t let go. He is the Huskies’ leader on offense and has the air of confidence you want. He cares about ball security and it shows and he also cares about extending plays, which he does very well with his feet. Some of it is by choice and some by necessity based on breakdowns up front. Either way, Shirreffs is too valuable to not be smart when it comes to taking off with the ball. He has taken some big hits. He’s also given some. That’s Shirreffs. He can be a little more accurate passing but in addition to his ability to move the ball he has shown good arm strength.\nNo controversy through six games. N.C.

Tyraiq Beals (16x165, TD) is one of the leading receivers on the team. The leader is junior Noel Thomas, pictured, (26x361, TD) and he’s been playing like the only person who can stop him is him and that happened once at BYU when he had two catches for 13 yards. He caught five passes for 62 yards and a touchdown the next week at UCF. He is the leader of the group. And the Huskies are so good, so big and so deep at tight end with 6-5 Tommy Myers (7x149 two TDs), 6-6 Alec Bloom (10x149), 6-7 Chris Lee and 6-5 Zordan Holman, both freshmen.\nUConn broke out a couple of its freshmen receivers, including Hergy Mayala (1 catch, 11 yards) and Aaron McLean (1x29) at UCF.

They could be better, possibly 5-1, if they scored points at Missouri (9-6 loss) or against Navy (28-18 loss at home).More important, signs of the dogged efforts to build a winning culture have been apparent on the heels of a 2-10 season. Although still inconsistent, UConn has had better offensive line play and offensive execution.But the program has come a long way in a year. With six games to go, the Huskies have a shot at bowl eligibility for the first time since the 2011 season. The difficult nonleague schedule, among the top 25 toughest in the nation, should serve them well. The Courant's Desmond Conner grades their first six games in his midseason report card.\nDesmond Conner", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fee97/turbine/hc-uconn-football-insider-midseason-report-car-006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fee99/turbine/hc-uconn-football-insider-midseason-report-car-008"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:02:20.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
