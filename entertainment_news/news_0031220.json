Colorado may have to wait years for Christo to get approval on his-long-delayed project on the Arkansas River. In the short-term, fans of the world's No. 1 public art maker can head to the Loveland Museum for an exhibit focusing on his achievements past, titled \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude: The Tom Golden Collection.\" Golden has been assembling objects by Christo and his late wife since 1974, when they were here for their \"Valley Curtain\" in Rifle. His holdings include drawings, sculptures and photographs. There's both collecting and patronage in Golden's effort; Christo covers the cost of his big works, using money from sales of his plans and drawings. Through Jan. 17, Loveland Museum , 503 N. Lincoln Ave., Loveland. $5. 970-962-2410 or lovelandmuseumgallery.org .\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:06:07.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
