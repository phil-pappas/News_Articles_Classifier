The show is slated for fall 2016 and additional casting will be announced later.\nLike Hamlet and Macbeth, Othello is a Shakespearean protagonist driven mad by suspicion and fear. In the play, Othello's trusted lieutenant spins a web to make him doubt his wife's fidelity.\nCraig plays James Bond in \"Spectre\" out next month and Oyelowo is next slated to co-star with Zoe Saldana in \"Nina\" about singer Nina Simone.\nRelated Stories 'I'm over it': Daniel Craig says he's done being James Bond Photos Actor David Oyelowo poses for photographers for the European premiere of ‘Selma’ at a central London cinema, Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015.
