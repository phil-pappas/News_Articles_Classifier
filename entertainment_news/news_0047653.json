Monday Night Football airs on ESPN, a sports channel owned by Disney. The trailer is scheduled to air Tuesday, Sydney time.\nThe new film, which continues three decades after the sixth Star Wars film, Return of the Jedi, features the galaxy in conflict, as the rebel alliance (now known as the resistance) clashes with a resurgent Imperial offshoot, the so-called First Order.\nThe studio also announced advance ticket sales for the film would open Monday, US time. It is not released in US cinemas until December 18, however a spike in early ticket sales is expected to confirm what most analysts already suspect: the film will break box office records when it is released.\nCheck out the new official poster!
