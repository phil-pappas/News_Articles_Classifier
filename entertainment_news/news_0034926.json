A week later and my perception really changed.Firstly, I must say that I am really happy that the youth are really willing to be educated in some form or another. From my last article which I submitted, I thought these students were spending too much time protesting and not sitting there studying. A week later, and I see that they are studying while camped outside management's office. Now that is what I call a really productive protest. Also, I am very pleased the students have taken this protest and directed their frustrations at the right places ( such as parliament, Luthuli house and the union buildings) The timing issue is debatable as I would have preferred this protest to have started at the beginning of the year ( especially when registration fees are due and you can more urgency in rebelling those fees) and that would be perfect timing to shut down all universities and urge the government to rethink their strategy before SONA. There were also incidents of violence but that is down to inefficiency in policing ( something reflective of the thugs ruling this country) To the students, maybe I was deceived by all these posts on facebook but I support this noble cause for free education. Whenever I look for the online courses, I get put off by these specialization courses with a price tag. The fact is, I feel that these universities offering courses at a cost are ripping us off. Quite frankly, if one online course is offered for free, so should all courses.Back to the real issue. So the government decides to attack our Public protector for uncovering corruption and spends money on launching an assault on her. Money taken from the students for education and research so that they can save us from the crisis we are in. After we were told that solar power is the best way to go, the government decides to go nuclear and tries to destroy our country. In that process, that deal had sucked the varsity funds dry and left potential students begging for money. So Nathi Nhleko, I dare you to read out your Nkandla report where Zuma does not have to pay a cent in front of the students. Maybe what you mean is that Zuma does not need to fund a student in need and that these students can suffer. And now Blade the communist. Listen Blade, this is not China where students can be oppressed like the Tianmen Square massacre. By you saying #studentsmustfall, you are trying to annihilate the peaceful students.To the riot police, if you attack the criminals in the same way as you assaulting the students, then South Africa will be safer to live.With Eskom and the Guptas, we had enough. What does the Guptas give back in terms of funding... Err... Nothing. It's about time that the Guptas contributed properly to society.You current government here, you can run away from the allegations of corruption but you cannot hide from the students. To the protesting students out there, you now have my full support in #feesmustfall campaign. Here are some tips1. Remember the umbrella revolution in Hong Kong, I encourage to take a leaf out of that. 2. Please don't break or vandalise anything, you are supposed to be educated people and not hooligans. Otherwise, this campaign is meaningless. 3. Try and minimize the disruption to traffic flow. These marches need to be planned so that it is meaningful yet no too disruptive. Maybe #feesmustfall must be a 24/7 campaign. Try work on a shift system so that there is at least regular media coverage and that these pesky can be kept on their toes.\nFinally to the government, is this a crisis or is a joke of a challenge?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:14:00.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
