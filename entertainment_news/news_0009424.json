X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nThe latest from the Conservative party conference is a call that all pensioners should \"immediately\" lose their benefits and allowances on the basis that, and I quote from the BBC, \"most won't be around by the next election, and the rest will have forgotten which party did it\". \nThe call, backed by Tory North Somerset MP Dr Liam Fox, said these cuts \"must be for keeps\". \nThe Conservatives may be hoping voters will have 'forgotten' by 2020 but I can assure them there will be plenty of us in Ukip ready to remind people. \nI wonder what your regular supporters of this, the truly 'nasty party', will have to say about possibly losing the winter fuel allowance (mentioned specifically as a cut) by December, if these cuts go ahead, and by next year at the latest. \nWhat other cuts do they plan? The BBC report didn't say. \nHow the Tories can justify these cuts to our most vulnerable people, and their loyal supporters in many cases, is beyond my feeble wits to understand, but it does go against their manifesto pledge to give the \"dignity and security you deserve in old age\". \nPerhaps Dr Fox can tell us what 'dignity' there is in being huddled under a blanket and risking serious ill health through hyperthermia? \nHowever we are well used to the Tories breaking manifesto pledges; they have done so about once a month since 2010! \nWhat a pity the majority didn't listen to us when we advised them to vote Ukip six months ago. With its fully financed and calculated plans which included (page 18 of the manifesto) keeping \"free bus passes, winter fuel allowances, free TV licences for the over 75s, free prescriptions and eye tests for the over 60s\" (guaranteed) amongst other proposals everyone would have been better off; all these things have been put at risk by returning a 'blue' government. \nYet again we see the folly of having voted Tory in May when alternatives were available. Maybe one day someone will listen to us? \nGreg Heathcliffe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:03:50.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
