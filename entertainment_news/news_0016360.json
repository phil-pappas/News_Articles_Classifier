Abrams, is the first of three new \"Star Wars\" movies being produced by Disney since it purchased the franchise from Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion.\nFans have seen two teasers: November's 88-second trailer and April's 2-minute trailer, which showcased a new cast of characters led by newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. Disney has buffered the film's release with strategically timed events such as April's Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California, and May's \"May The 4th Be With You\" Star Wars day.\n\"Disney has done a very good job of keeping the ebb and flow of their marketing and information at just the right pace,\" Dergarabedian said.\n(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:10:55.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
