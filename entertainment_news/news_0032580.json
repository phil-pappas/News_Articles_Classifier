You just slipped her a sausage!” Alison Steadman’s Mavis Pike exclaims as the local butcher hands Winters a package. \n“Associated Press. I’m doing an article on the Home Guard, and you come highly recommended,” Winters tells Captain Mainwaring, played by Toby Jones. George and Rose in Dad’s Army (Universal Pictures/PA) \nThe writer is seen taking tea with Mainwaring, flattering him with the words: “You remind me of someone… Winston Churchill!’ \nThe Captain agrees, adding: “I’d like to think that if we met, we’d both be the richer for it.” \nThe movie is due for release in February 2016 and as the trailer opens, the Home Guard is marching through the town decorated with bunting and flags.

Shoulders back – you’re a sergeant in the Home Guard, not a sack of potatoes!” Mainwaring barks at second in command, Sergeant Wilson played by Bill Nighy. \nSherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss’s Colonel Theakes informs Mainwaring about “an enemy spy operating in the area”. \nMainwaring can barely contain his excitement: “This is it men, our chance to play a real part in this war,” he tells his troops. \nBlake Harrison, from The Inbetweeners, plays Private Pike – complete with the character’s famous scarf: “I’ll catch him, Sir. What does he look like?” \n“We don’t know, Frank. That’s rather the point with spies,” Wilson drily responds, before Mainwaring hurls his trademark put-down at Pike: “Stupid boy!” Bill Nighy on the Dad’s Army set (Anna Gowthorpe/PA) \nThe cast is rounded out by Michael Gambon as Private Godfrey, Tom Courtenay as Lance-Corporal Jack Jones, Bill Paterson as Private Fraser and Mrs Biggs star Daniel Mays as Private Joe Walker. \nThe film, which sees the bumbling Home Guard track down an enemy spy with a little help from glamorous Winters, hits cinemas nearly 50 years after the classic TV series first aired in 1968. \nSet in 1944, just as the Second World War is coming to an end, the trailer also includes a snip of the men stumbling upon a bull, comic army manoeuvres, an explosion and the classic line: “Don’t panic!” The Dad’s Army cast (Alex Bailey/Universal Pictures/PA) \nAt its height, Dad’s Army commanded audiences of nearly 20 million viewers. It is still averaging very solid viewing figures of nearly two million with its latest rerun on BBC Two.
