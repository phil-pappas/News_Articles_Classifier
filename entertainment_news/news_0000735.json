The publication claimed that the 35-year-old actor popped the question during a romantic candlelight dinner. The magazine said the couple was ready to take their relationship to the next level. It quoted a so-called \"insider\" as saying, \"Wilmer proposed over a candlelight dinner,\" before adding, \"It was very romantic and Demi said, 'yes!' \" Nevertheless, the magazine had no details about where and when the engagement took place. Instead of giving details about the engagement, the source added, \"They aren't in a rush to get a ring.\" Responding to the engagement report, a rep for the \" From Prada to Nada \" actor told Gossip Cop that it was \"not true.\" Wilmer hasn't even popped the question to the \"Cool for the Summer\" singer yet. Earlier this year, Demi denied engagement rumors via an Instagram post. She posted on the social media a picture of her hand holding Wilmer's. She donned three rings on her fingers. Alongside the picture, she wrote, \"He's there for me when others aren't... He supports me when others won't... He loves me when others don't. (not engaged... yall are crazy ).\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:57:12.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
