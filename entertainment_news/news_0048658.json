The terms of the out-of-court settlement were not disclosed. \nAfter Williams' death last year, the actor and comedian's estate was in a legal dispute between his widow and the children. Susan Williams filed a court petition in December, saying some of her husband's personal items were taken without her permission. \nThe children countered that Susan Williams tried to change the trust agreement and deprive them of items that their father clearly intended to leave to them. \nWhile the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, Williams gets to stay in the San Francisco Bay area home she shared with the Oscar winner. His kids Zachary, Zelda and Cody settled on their father's personal items. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
