She said, 'It was really lovely to see the real Steve.' She's talking about the softer side of him that she got to experience as a friend and the stiller sides of him that I do think the film really does reveal in ways that perhaps they haven't been seen before. He's very much a man and a father in this story, as well as the perfectionist that he was. \n\"I'm very proud of the film, I have to say. I think it's a very, very honest portrayal of who he really was as a man.\" \nJoanna isn't the only one of Steve's confidantes to give the movie the thumbs up - Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak also recently applauded the director and lead actor Michael Fassbender for capturing the tech genius' spirit onscreen. \n\"In some prior movies, I saw (the actors) simulating Steve Jobs, but they didn't really make me feel like I was in his head understanding what was going on inside of him,\" Wozniak told the BBC. \"This movie absolutely accomplishes that, and it's due to great acting, which obviously comes from great directing.... When you see it portrayed dramatically, not the way it really happened, but in a way that is emotionally graphic, it really conveys what Steve Jobs was really like inside... and what it was like to be around him.\" \nAshton Kutcher previously tackled the same role in 2013 biopic Jobs.
