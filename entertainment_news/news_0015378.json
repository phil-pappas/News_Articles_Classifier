Tying in with the 40th anniversary of the comedy classic, the Pythons have unveiled 15 minutes of Terry Gilliam animation originally created for the film.Utterly, amazingly, delightfully bonkers, the quarter-hour of medieval madness features a giant bearded slug and a pair of legs with a face. Monty Python and the Holy Grail was the feature directorial debut for both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, poking fun at King Arthur (played by the late, great Graham Chapman) and his kingniggets.The film was also the inspiration for Eric Idle's Tony Award-winning comedy Spamalot , which is also very, very silly. Available in a specially-packaged 40th anniversary version - complete with catapult - Monty Python and the Holy Grail can now help you fire toy cows at your friends.
