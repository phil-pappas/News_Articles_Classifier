There are currently two homes in the area on the market. \nThe furthest thing from working class is a 7-bedroom, 13-bathroom mansion on eight lavishly landscaped acres a short walk from Springsteen's Rumson pad. (Springsteen also owns a horse farm in Colts Neck and a secluded compound in Los Angeles's Benedict Canyon ). \nThe Rumson spread includes a 2,000-square-foot pool house with full kitchen and a tennis court, the according to the Zillow listing . The home — slashed from $13.5 million to $9.999 million — has a two-story, barrel-vaulted entry hall and a paneled library with coffered ceiling and fireplace. The walk-out lower level includes a full bar, wine cellar, gym and theater. Taxes are $130,605. \nRELATED: All 293 Bruce Springsteen songs, ranked; the ultimate Boss list \nIf your budget is relatively Tom Joad-ian, though, there is a custom-built, 5-bedroom home with a wrap-around porch on two acres, also close by the Springsteen compound. Offered for $2.795 million, this home is built for entertaining, with a bar, billiard room, screened porch and a bluestone indoor garden room, according to Zillow . The master bedroom has a custom fireplace, two walk-in closets, a steam show and spa tub.
