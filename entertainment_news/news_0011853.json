JoBlo brings words about another team-up movie in Phase Three, saying that Thor will be supported by fellow hero Hulk in the upcoming \" Thor: Ragnarok \". Mark Ruffalo 's Hulk will team up with Chris Hemsworth 's Thor to deal with \"what amounts to the Norse Apocalypse.\" The site claimed that Tom Hiddleston 's Loki and Jaimie Alexander 's Lady Sif would make appearances and the movie would involve a \"distant planet\" that's \"not Asgard and not Earth.\" Given that there would be a third planet, people started to assume that the upcoming movie would bring in the long-rumored Planet Hulk storyline. However, it is not the only possibility, considering that there are 9 worlds on Yggdrasil, and each constitutes a planet of its own. \"Thor: Ragnarok\" will be the last movie in the Asgardian trilogy. It is directed by Taika Waititi with the script penned by Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost. Produced by Kevin Feige, the God of Thunder movie is slated to be released Stateside on November 2, 2017. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 More Thor: Ragnarok News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:11:48.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
