In the case of the global positioning system, or GPS, individuals and corporations reduce the number of complications associated with finding a position on the world. It uses advanced technological systems to help identify the specific location on the planet and then provide tools to find another position in relation to the current location. In an upcoming segment for the program \"Voices In America\" hosted by James Earl Jones, this technology and associated products will be discussed.\nThe advances in global positioning systems, or GPS technology, allow individuals to accurately follow directions to a different area without facing complications. The technology provides information about the current location, the location of the destination and directions that avoid problems like toll roads, heavy traffic or indirect methods of reaching the location.\nSince the technology uses satellites in orbit around the planet, the information changes constantly to keep up with alterations to roads and areas. Satellites work together to identify the specific location using relativity and trilateration. While mistakes happen occasionally due to weather conditions and poor readings, the technological advances provide new ways to reach a destination without complications.\n\"Voices In America\" with host James Earl Jones will explain the way that GPS technology works and the latest innovations in GPS technology in this upcoming segment. The piece will discuss the history, advances and potential future applications of the software and technology.\n\"Voices In America\" is a program developed for Public Television, but it does not have any affiliation with PBS. It is an independently produced broadcast.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13010449.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13010449.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:46:32.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
