Actor Vincent Price and his wife eventually bought it and donated it to the museum in 1981.\nHonolulu Museum of Art officials will give the pole back to the Tlingit (KLINK'-it) people Thursday.\nLangdon says he learned the totem pole was used for burials, and there were remains of a man inside when Barrymore displayed it.
