To celebrate, the public is invited to meet DeRubeis during an opening reception held from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Oct. 25 .\nDeRubeis paints on metal, manipulating pigments and chemicals while utilizing power tools, fire and freezing techniques to create his art. He calls his style \"abstract sensualism,\" referring to the organic and soft, sleek aesthetics his style creates.\n\"Rather than simply painting on metal, DeRubeis incorporates the metallic surface into his paintings, creating works that give the illusion of movement, an effect one can only fully experience in person,\" says David Gorman , Gallery Director for Park West Gallery.\nAt the exhibition, DeRubeis will feature abstract art as well as figurative art and still lifes, many of which will be unveiled for the first time and available to collect. Each work takes around three weeks to complete, and thanks to DeRubeis' creative process, no two are ever alike.\n\"I use different abrasive power tools for different grinding actions for the backgrounds, and then I use a mixture of mixed media –chemicals and paints – to apply to the piece,\" DeRubeis says.\nDeRubeis was honored in 2005 with two nominations by the First Annual Fine Art Awards. Nominated in the \"Mixed Media\" and \"New Movement\" categories, he earned the MUSE Award in \"New Movement.\" DeRubeis dedicated his award to his grandfather, who played an integral role in his becoming an artist.\nAdmission is free to the public. Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays .
