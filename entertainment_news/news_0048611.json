The Steve Jobs Original Motion Picture Soundtrack features new music by Award-winning composer Daniel Pemberton , as well as two iconic tracks from Bob Dylan, and songs by The Libertines and the Maccabees.\nUniversal Pictures' Steve Jobs , which stars Michael Fassbender as the pioneering founder of Apple, will be released in New York and Los Angeles on October 9. The film will expand to additional North American markets on October 16 and wide on October 23 .\nPrior to the beginning of principal photography, Pemberton worked alongside the filmmakers to develop a unique approach to composing the music for the three distinct periods of time depicted in Steve Jobs . What they've created is a symphonic tour de force with three distinguishable aural points of view to complement the film's narrative arc:\nThe first movement, set in 1984, expresses the optimism of Jobs' first product launch, the Macintosh. Restricting himself to equipment of the time and embracing their limitations, Pemberton utilized what is now technology of the past – synthesizers such as the Yamaha CS-80, Roland SH-1000, Roland Juno-60, and Moog Minimoog – to reflect that era's visions of the future, while still creating a sound world that would sit comfortably alongside Sorkin's dialogue and Boyle's direction.\nThe second movement, set in 1988 at the San Francisco Opera House, sees the unveiling of the NeXTcube with a theatrical orchestral fantasia. With composed, large-scale operatic pieces, elaborate emotional transformations of a simple tuning-up sequence, and a dramatic symphony, the score reflects both Jobs the conductor and ringmaster – as well as a man focused on revenge.\nThe more reflective, internal, and emotional third movement takes us to 1998 with Jobs' unveiling of the iMac, and echoes the various ways in which we utilize computers as we know them today. \"Today, I write pretty much everything I do on an Apple machine descended, in part, from that iMac,\" said Pemberton. \"I use a piece of Apple software called Logic. I can write music, manipulate sounds, produce recordings, and express myself as an artist without ever leaving the computer.\"\nPemberton is an Ivor Novello Award-winning and multi-BAFTA-nominated composer who is well known for embracing a wide range of musical mediums – from electronic to orchestral – throughout his work. After more than a decade establishing himself as one of the most inventive and experimental voices in British television, Pemberton moved into the world of film with the period supernatural thriller The Awakening . His hybrid choral, orchestral, and electronic score caught the ear of Ridley Scott , who hired the composer to score The Counselor . He collaborated again with Scott on the director's foray into television, The Vatican . In 2014, Pemberton won the Discovery of the Year Award at the prestigious World Soundtrack Awards for his work on Cuban Fury and The Counselor . This year has seen the release of Pemberton's acclaimed soundtrack to Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\nAbout the Film\nSet backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career – beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 – Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter.\nSteve Jobs is directed by Academy Award ® winner Danny Boyle and written by Academy Award ® winner Aaron Sorkin , working from Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography of the Apple founder. The producers are Mark Gordon , Guymon Casady of Film 360, Scott Rudin , Boyle, and Academy Award ® winner Christian Colson .\nMichael Fassbender plays Steve Jobs, the pioneering founder of Apple, with Academy Award ® -winning actress Kate Winslet starring as Joanna Hoffman , former marketing chief of Macintosh. Steve Wozniak , who co-founded Apple, is played by Seth Rogen , and Jeff Daniels stars as former Apple CEO John Sculley . The film also stars Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan , Jobs' ex-girlfriend, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld , one of the original members of the Apple Macintosh development team. www.stevejobsthefilm.com\nTrack List (all tracks by Daniel Pemberton , unless otherwise noted):\nThe Musicians Play Their Instruments… It's Not Working Child (Father) Jack It Up The Circus of Machines I (Overture) Russian Roulette Change the World The Skylab Plan Don't Look Back Into the Sun – The Libertines …I Play The Orchestra The Circus of Machines II (Allegro) Revenge Rainy Day Women #12 & 35 – Bob Dylan It's An Abstract Life Out of Balance The Nature of People 1998.
