In an interview with The Red Bulletin , the 47-year-old actor reveals what he really thinks about the British superspy, dubbing him \"a misogynist.\" When asked about what people can learn from Bond that may help them in daily life, Craig simply says, \"Nothing.\" The interviewer then continues asking Craig about Bond's skills with ladies. Craig says it's common knowledge that the 007 agent has some problems with women. \"Bond can be a gentleman. Sometimes, anyway. He's a considerate person, he takes care of business, and he looks out for other people and his family. He's someone who opens doors for people - for everyone, that is, not just women,\" the actor explains. \"But let's not forget that he's actually a misogynist. A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long.\" Moreover, Craig doesn't agree if people think that Bond has become more chivalrous in the past few years. He says that it's because there are some improved female characters sharing the screen with the 007 agent. \"That's because we've surrounded him with very strong women who have no problem putting him in his place,\" he says. In the upcoming Bond movie, \" Spectre \", Craig is joined by the likes of Monica Bellucci , Lea Seydoux , Naomie Harris , Alessandro Cremona Ben Whishaw , Ralph Fiennes and Dave Bautista in the cast. Directed by Sam Mendes, the movie will be released in the U.S. on November 6. Sony Pictures recently released four clips for the upcoming movie. One of them shows the superspy agent engaging on a fight with Bautista's Mr. Hinx in a train which ends up with Bond hitting Hinx's head with a glass. The second one features the 007 agent having a conversation with Seydoux's Madeleine Swann while he is busy with his old laptop. Meanwhile, the one entitled \"Future\", features Andrew Scott, Fiennes and Harris' characters. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:05:03.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
