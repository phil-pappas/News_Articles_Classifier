The track was premiered on radio on Thursday, October 22 before hitting the singer's Vevo page later in the day along with its accompanying dance video that features some ladies busting out choreographed moves to the beat. Produced by Skrillex and Blood Diamonds, the upbeat EDM-tinged pop tune finds Bieber apologizing for everything he did that tore his and his ex-girlfriend's relationship apart. He admits he still loves her and begs her to give him another chance. \"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?/ Cause I'm missing more than just your body/ Is it too late now to say sorry?/ Yeah I know that I let you down/ Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?\" he sings. \"Sorry\" is the second track to have surfaced from Bieber's new album \" Purpose \", due out on November 13. It follows lead cut \"What Do You Mean?\" that debuted at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 following its release in late August. After dropping the single, Bieber is now gearing up to perform at the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards, which is taking place in Milan this weekend. The Canadian superstar will treat viewers to new material off his upcoming album at the event. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:43:53.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
